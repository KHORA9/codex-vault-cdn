That some were inevitable where so\r\nmuch had to be told in so narrow a space is no excuse for such errors\r\nas I have committed. It is my sincere hope that they are not very\r\nfrequent nor very gross, and that my book does at least indicate the\r\nmain outlines of the polity and the achievements of the navy. It is my\r\npleasant duty to thank the Reverend William Hunt for his kindness in\r\nrevising my proofs, and for the many excellent suggestions he made.\r\nI have also to present my thanks to Messrs. Blackwood for giving me\r\ntheir permission to make use in Chapter III. of matter published in\r\n_Blackwood’s Magazine_; and to the proprietors of the _Saturday Review_\r\nfor allowing me to make use of articles on the mutinies of 1797,\r\nformerly published in that periodical.\r\n\r\n      DAVID HANNAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAP.

From that time forward it was settled beyond all dispute\r\nthat when the two differed the last word was not to be with the king.\r\nOur sovereigns have ruled by a Parliamentary title, and the authority\r\nwhich conferred the Crown must always be superior in fact, if not in\r\ntheory, to the Crown itself. Within Parliament the dominating body\r\nmust necessarily be the House of Commons, which has the command of the\r\npurse. After 1688 the Crown, or the aristocracy, could only govern\r\nby securing the support, by means of pocket boroughs, by persuasion\r\nor corruption, of a majority of the Lower House. The navy, like the\r\nrest of the nation, was deeply affected by the change. From this time\r\nforward we hear little of the personal influence of the king. It was\r\nto the House of Commons that the navy appealed. Officers who wished\r\nto push their fortunes no longer thought of securing the goodwill\r\nof the sovereign or of a favourite. They became members of the House\r\nof Commons and earned promotion by serving a Parliamentary party. In\r\none way the change was for the manifest good of the navy. It now had\r\na master who might be unwilling to pay handsomely, but who both would\r\nand could pay whatever he chose to promise with a regularity far beyond\r\nthe power of the king. In the years following the Revolution there were\r\nindeed complaints of wages in arrear and of necessities neglected. But\r\nthis was only during the first period of strife. The increasing wealth\r\nof the nation supplied Parliament with ample means, and after a time\r\nthe money was always regularly forthcoming. In another way the change\r\nwas not so good. A great deal of party spirit was introduced into the\r\nnavy, and there were times when Whig and Tory animosities interfered\r\nwith the loyal discharge of duty.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution also dates, if it did not cause, an evolution in the\r\nnavy. After 1688 the sea service was sharply marked off from the army.\r\nDuring the reign of King James it had not been uncommon to find men who\r\nhad served alternately as soldiers and sailors, while some held double\r\nemployments. Isolated cases of the kind may be met with later, but they\r\nbecame very rare, and soon disappeared altogether. The formation of a\r\nlarge standing army, and the participation of England in Continental\r\nwars, drew off the gentlemen volunteers who had been found in the\r\nfleets of Charles II. The stamp of man described in old plays as “a\r\ncoxcomb but stout,” had a natural preference for the army. It did\r\nnot take him off dry land, and the practice of retiring into winter\r\nquarters enabled him to combine a great deal of pleasure with his\r\nfighting. A ship was at all times but a prison, and in those it was a\r\nprison very much overcrowded and abounding in foul smells. The navy was\r\nleft entirely to the tarpaulin who had been bred to the sea, and could\r\nendure its hardships.\r\n\r\nThe final victory of the tarpaulin element in the corps of naval\r\nofficers brought with it both good and evil. The good lay in their\r\nseamanship. Even a bad seaman is better than an ignorant or careless\r\nlandsman in command of a ship. The purely technical part of the navy’s\r\nwork, that which consisted in the mere handling of the vessel, was\r\nbetter done in the years following the Revolution than had been the\r\ncase before, except during the Interregnum, when also the sailors had\r\nbeen the predominant element. The evil which came was of a kind not\r\nto be wholly attributed to the disappearance of the military officer\r\nfrom the higher ranks of the fleet. It was that there was a distinct\r\nfall in the purely military spirit, and as a navy is a fighting as\r\nwell as a navigating force, this was a misfortune. When we speak of\r\na fallen military spirit, it is not meant that there was any sinking\r\nin the mere courage of the service, but only that the naval officer\r\nas he became at the Revolution and as he remained till far into the\r\neighteenth century, was first and foremost a seaman, and that he had a\r\ntendency to discharge the military side of his duty in blind obedience\r\nto various rules of thumb. Two reasons may be assigned for this. Times\r\nof revolution are very often followed by times of lassitude. The\r\nseventeenth century had been very stormy, and it was to be expected\r\nthat the Englishman of the following generations would be a less daring\r\nand original man than his ancestor of the Civil War time. The sailors\r\nshared in the general deadening and commonplaceness of their age. It\r\nwas only natural that men who went to sea as boys, and were never asked\r\nto be more than sailors, should not have tried to be more. Then it was\r\nthe misfortune of the navy that just at a time when it was tending to\r\nstupidity in military conduct, it was called upon by authority to obey\r\na set of hard and fast rules.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the fighting orders drawn up by the\r\nadmirals of the Commonwealth at the close of the First Dutch War, and\r\nreissued by Penn when he sailed on his expedition to San Domingo. It\r\nwill be remembered that these rules established the line ahead as the\r\nregular formation for a fleet about to engage the enemy. After the\r\nSecond Dutch War they were reissued by the Duke of York with certain\r\nadditions of his own, and they became the orthodox pattern for the\r\nnavy’s method of fighting. It is to them that we owe it that the line\r\nof battle passed from being the order adopted for the purpose of coming\r\nmost effectually into action with the enemy, and grew to be regarded\r\nas an end in itself. The duke’s orders would not perhaps have hampered\r\na more original generation; but they were sure to have a deadening\r\neffect upon men who felt no natural impulse to think. The admiral\r\nwho conformed to the orders could always plead that he had obeyed\r\nauthority, whereas if he departed from them, and his independence was\r\nnot justified by a brilliant victory, he would be in considerable\r\ndanger of being accused of insubordination. The harm done by these\r\ninstructions arose mainly from two of the articles. No. VIII. lays it\r\ndown that “if the enemy stay to fight (his majesty’s fleet having the\r\nwind), the headmost squadron of his majesty’s fleet shall steer for\r\nthe headmost of the enemy’s ships.” No. XVI. contains the following\r\nperemptory instruction: “In all cases of fight with the enemy, the\r\ncommanders of his majesty’s ships are to keep the fleet _in one line_,\r\nand (as much as may be) to preserve that order of battle which they\r\nhave been directed to keep before the time of fight.” The duke had\r\nforeseen that an English fleet, being to leeward, might wish to force\r\non a battle. In this case it was directed that the van upon obtaining\r\na favourable position for the purpose, should tack and break through\r\nthe enemy. So soon as it had broken through it was to turn, and attack\r\nfrom windward. In the meantime the centre and rear were to remain to\r\nleeward, and co-operate with the van. But this was a very difficult\r\nmanœuvre to carry out against even a moderately efficient opponent.\r\nShips performing it would be liable to lose spars and to drift to\r\nleeward towards their own centre. Moreover, an enemy who kept his wind\r\nand stood on might possibly file past, and so deliver the fire of all,\r\nor the greater part, of his ships into the unsupported English van.\r\nArticle III., which prescribed this method of attack, remained a mere\r\ncounsel of perfection, and was soon dropped out of the fighting orders.\r\nIt was, I venture to affirm, never acted on except by Howe on the 29th\r\nof May 1794, and then with only partial success.\r\n\r\nThe course followed by English admirals was less complicated and risky\r\nthan this, but also less likely to prove effectual when fully carried\r\nout. When they were to leeward and the enemy would not attack them,\r\nthey manœuvred to gain the weather-gage. When they had the wind of\r\nthe enemy, they came down on him with their fleet in line—the leading\r\nship of the English steering for the leading ship of the enemy, and\r\nthe others behind for their respective opponents. Thus the two fleets\r\nengaged van to van, centre to centre, rear to rear. To take “every man\r\nhis bird” was the familiar naval image for a well-conducted action\r\nwith an enemy who did not shirk. Of course this method only applied to\r\nthe case where the two fleets were going in the same direction. If one\r\nturned, the two would pass one another, and then they must curl round\r\nagain before the action could be resumed. The advantage of engaging the\r\nenemy from the leading ship to the last was this, that it prevented\r\nany portion of his ships from tacking, and so putting some of the\r\nEnglish between two fires. The drawback was that if the two fleets were\r\neven not very unequal, no overwhelming superiority was developed on\r\neither side at a chosen point. The damage done was about equivalent,\r\nand the two separated without decisive result. This would not have\r\nbeen the case if the admirals after the Revolution had been as ready\r\nas the chiefs of the Dutch wars to depart from their line when once\r\nit had served its purpose of bringing them in contact with the enemy.\r\nIf the captains had been allowed to steer through the hostile line\r\nwherever they could find or make an opening, a general mêlée must have\r\nensued, and the battle would have been fought out. But here came in the\r\ninfluence of Article No. XVI., which prescribed the retention of the\r\n“same order” all through the battle. If an English captain stood out of\r\nthe line to press through the enemy, it must necessarily be broken. But\r\nthis was rigidly forbidden. Therefore the system of fighting adopted\r\nby our navy at the close of the seventeenth century made it inevitable\r\nthat our admirals would attack from windward, would spread themselves\r\nall along the enemy’s line, that the damage done would be pretty\r\nequally divided between the two fleets, and that the enemy, having the\r\nroad to leeward open, could retire whenever he pleased.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution brought no considerable alteration in the mere\r\nadministrative machinery of the navy. From that time forward the office\r\nof Lord High Admiral was habitually put into commission, but the change\r\nwas made for the purpose of finding the greatest number of places for\r\nParliamentary supporters, and was in substance not very different\r\nfrom the method adopted by the Commonwealth, by Charles I., and by\r\nJames I. It was of more importance that the reign of William III. saw\r\nthe complete establishment of half pay. The later Stuarts had granted\r\nallowances to flag officers and a few captains, but the Parliament of\r\nthe Revolution first regularly provided for the support of a body of\r\nofficers of all commissioned ranks when not in active service. This\r\nalso was inevitable if the country was to maintain a regular staff for\r\nthe fleet. It was neither possible to maintain the navy continually on\r\na war footing, nor to disband the whole corps of officers so soon as\r\npeace was signed, and trust to forming another when the need had arisen.\r\n\r\nThe establishment made by King James II. in 1686 fell with its maker.\r\nThe handsome table-money allowance was not paid after the Revolution,\r\nand the officers were thus thrown back on the old scale of pay. This\r\nmeant that the captain of a first-rate who had flattered himself with\r\nthe hope of receiving £535, 18s. 4d. per annum found that he was in\r\nfact only entitled to £285, 18s. 4d. Captains of the lesser rates were\r\ndisappointed in proportion. At the same time the regulations depriving\r\nthem of convoy money, and restricting their chances of casual gains,\r\nwere more strictly enforced. The trading classes had won great power\r\nby the Revolution, and could put pressure on the House of Commons, and\r\nthey were not unnaturally eager to defend themselves against extortion.\r\nTheir case was good, but the grievance of the naval officer was not the\r\nless genuine. Yet the loss of King James’s establishment was probably\r\nnot much regretted by the navy at large, since it benefited the\r\ncaptains only. Other ranks had their grievances. The complaints of the\r\nsea officers were so loud and persistent that at last the Government\r\nwas compelled to do them some justice. By an Order of the Commissioners\r\nof the Admiralty dated 14th February 1694, it was established that the\r\nsea pay “of the flag officers, commanders, lieutenants, masters and\r\nsurgeons of their majesty’s ships be increased to as much more as it\r\nis at present.” As a set off to this the number of servants they were\r\nentitled to take to sea at the expense of the Crown was reduced. With\r\nthis provision for the officers on active service came the formation\r\nof a half-pay list. It was somewhat arbitrarily constructed. The\r\nbenefit was confined to “all flag officers and commanders of ships of\r\nthe first, second, third, fourth and fifth rates, and of fireships, and\r\nalso the first lieutenants and masters of the first, second and third\r\nrates who have served a year in ships of rates respectively, or have\r\nbeen in a general engagement with the enemy, and shall have performed\r\ntheir duties to the satisfaction of the Lord High Admiral of England\r\nor the Commissioners executing that office.” These were to “be allowed\r\nhalf pay during their being on shore in time of peace at home.”\r\n\r\nThis establishment was too good to last. When the Peace of Ryswick was\r\nmade, the country was burdened with a heavy debt. The House of Commons\r\nwas in an economical mood. It insisted upon disbanding a large part of\r\nthe troops, and was only prevented from leaving the officers entirely\r\nwithout support by the strenuous exertions of the king. William III.\r\nmade no effort to save the naval officers, for the House of Commons\r\nhad no such jealousy of the fleet as of the army. The sea officers\r\npresented a petition stating their hard case. The petition was laid on\r\nthe table in a busy session, and was for a time smothered, but in the\r\nfollowing year the Commons took up the case of the naval officers, and\r\nthe result was the establishment of April 1700. This new scheme cut\r\ndown the rate of pay allowed during the last six years. According to\r\na tolerably uniform practice, the reduction was less severe with the\r\nhigher than with the lower ranks. While the Admiral of the Fleet was\r\nreduced from £6 to £5 per diem, a captain of a fifth-rate was reduced\r\nfrom 12s. to 8s. But while the House of Commons was thus economising\r\nthe whole pay, it fully recognised the necessity of maintaining a\r\n“competent number of Experienced Sea Officers, supported on Shore, who\r\nmay be within reach to answer any sudden or immergent Occasion; and\r\ntherefore do humbly propose the number of Flag Officers, Captains,\r\nLieutenants, and Masters following, to be always supported on Shore\r\nwhile out of Employment, by the Allowances against their Names\r\nexprest.” The scale drawn up by Parliament provided for 9 admirals at\r\nsums ranging from 17s. 6d. per diem for the Rear-Admiral to £2, 10s.\r\nfor the Admiral of the Fleet. For 50 captains who had served during the\r\n“late war,” at 10s. a day for 20 and 8s. for 30. For 100 lieutenants\r\nwho had seen service, in the following proportions: 40 at 2s. 6d. and\r\n60 at 2s. For 30 masters, of whom one half were to receive 2s. 6d.\r\nand the other half 2s. per diem. The total half-pay charge of that\r\ntime was only £18,113. No officer who took service with the merchants,\r\nor had other employment, was to be entitled to the allowance. As\r\nofficers on the half-pay list died or were drawn for active service,\r\nan equal number of others who were duly qualified were to step into\r\nthe enjoyment of the allowance. It will be seen that this was at\r\nbest a half measure. Many men who deserved to be supported were left\r\nwithout provision, yet the House of Commons had adopted the principle\r\nof granting half pay, and that was a great step towards the complete\r\nestablishment of the rule that all who served the State were entitled\r\nto be maintained at its expense, even when they were not immediately\r\nwanted. It is in this tentative way, not by great administrative\r\nschemes, but by small measures meant to meet a present necessity, that\r\nthe whole of the organisation of our navy has grown. At the close of\r\nthe reign of Queen Anne the right to half pay was made general.\r\n\r\nOne other great change directly affecting the navy was brought about by\r\nthe Revolution. The expulsion of King James left England free to become\r\nthe leader, and the main promoter, of the opposition to Louis XIV. From\r\nthat time forward our enemy was always France. When we met the Spaniard\r\nor the Dutchman again, it was with very rare exceptions because they\r\nwere allies of the French. The resistance to Louis XIV. grew into a\r\ngeneral colonial and political rivalry between France and England. The\r\nfight was prolonged throughout the eighteenth century and into the\r\nnineteenth. Some knowledge of the navy we were to meet in every sea and\r\nin so many battles during a century and a quarter is necessary in any\r\nhistory of the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\nThe French Navy is marked off very sharply from our own by the fact\r\nthat it was always, and solely, the handiwork of the Crown. In England\r\nnecessity taught the nation that it must have a fleet, and the nation\r\neither forced attention to its wants on the Crown at times when the\r\nking was indifferent, or provided itself with a naval force when the\r\nroyal authority was suspended or subordinate. France is admirably\r\nplaced for commerce, but it has not the same need for trade as\r\nEngland. It is a great corn-growing and wine-producing country, and\r\nits inhabitants have grown rich by constant industry and thrift. They\r\nhave rarely shown much faculty for trade on a great scale. In such\r\nconditions the navy fell into neglect, except when the ruler wished\r\nto possess one for political reasons. When Louis XIV. attained his\r\nmajority vigorous efforts were made to form a powerful fleet. In 1669\r\nthe king restored the office of Admiral, which had been suspended by\r\nRichelieu, in favour of his natural son the Count of Vermandois. The\r\nCount was a child and the navy was governed in his name by a Minister\r\nof Marine and a Council. The Minister of Marine for some years was\r\nM. de Lyonne, who worked under the supervision of Colbert. This\r\ngreat administrator, who laboured hard to supply France with foreign\r\ncommerce and colonies, applied an almost feverish activity to the work\r\nof creating a fleet. Five military ports were established, namely,\r\nDunkirk, Havre, Brest, Rochefort, on the Channel and the Ocean, and\r\nToulon on the Mediterranean. Dunkirk and Havre were too shallow for\r\nships of great burden. The long stretch of coast from Brest to the\r\nfrontier of Spain is ill provided with harbours. The old port of\r\nBrouage, which had been used in the Middle Ages, had become silted\r\nup, and was useless. Colbert was compelled to create a harbour and\r\nan arsenal at Rochefort, where there had formerly not even been a\r\nvillage, though the place has great natural aptitude. Yet Rochefort\r\nhas always been of subordinate importance. The great naval station\r\nof France on the Ocean has been at the magnificent harbour of Brest.\r\nToulon, the naval station of the Mediterranean, is also a fine natural\r\nharbour. The mechanical ingenuity of the French has always been shown\r\nin shipbuilding. It was comparatively easy for Colbert to provide fine\r\nvessels. Some of the noblest warships of the time were built under\r\nhis directions. These were the ships which excited the admiration of\r\nCharles II. and his brother, when the Count D’Estrées brought his\r\nsquadron to Portsmouth at the beginning of the Third Dutch War.\r\n\r\nIt was less easy to form a corps of officers and to collect crews.\r\nAlthough France possesses some excellent seamen in Normandy and\r\nBrittany, the maritime population has never been large. There were few\r\nexperienced officers, either gentleman or tarpaulin, to command the\r\nking’s ships. The seamen of Dieppe, St. Malo, or Havre were daring.\r\nThey had invaded the Spanish West Indies before Hawkins made his first\r\nvoyage, but they were not numerous enough to supply the king with\r\nan equivalent for the large body of ship’s captains trained among\r\nourselves by the Civil War and the wars with the Dutch. Besides, they\r\nwere hardly the men to whom a king of France would have cared to\r\nentrust the honour of his flag. In the early years of the king’s reign\r\nit was found necessary to give the command of fleets and individual\r\nships to mere gentlemen who were not only not seamen, but who looked\r\ndown upon those who were, with all the contempt usually shown by\r\nthe French _noblesse_ for mechanics. This partly accounts for the\r\nineptitude shown by French naval officers during the naval campaigns\r\nof 1672 and 1673. The exertions of Colbert did much to remedy this\r\ndefect. By twenty years of hard work and the most energetic driving, he\r\nformed a naval organisation. The orders issued for this purpose were so\r\nnumerous that it was found necessary to reduce them to a Code. Colbert\r\nbegan the work, but did not live to finish it. On his death in 1683 he\r\nwas succeeded by his son Colbert de Seignelay, who continued what his\r\nfather had begun. The famous _Ordonnance_, or Code of Law of the old\r\nFrench Royal Navy, was at last completed, and by a curious coincidence\r\nit was promulgated in April 1689, in the month before the beginning of\r\nthe war with England.\r\n\r\nThis body of laws, or regulations, was very French in its completeness,\r\nits air of logical coherence, and its excessive regulation, of every\r\ndetail of the service. It was contained in twenty-three books. It\r\ndivided the French Navy into four branches, three civil and one\r\nmilitary. The three civil branches, collectively known as _La Plume_,\r\nor the Pen, were divided between the purchase, manufacture, and care\r\nof materials. The administration of the dockyards was in the hands\r\nof the Pen. At the head of each dockyard was a civil officer, called\r\nthe _Intendant de la marine_. The military branch, called _L’Epée_,\r\nor the Sword, consisted of the naval officers. It was entrusted\r\nwith the navigation and the fighting of the ships. Under the old\r\norganisation established by Richelieu, the control of the dockyards\r\nhad been given to the Sword; but Colbert, who was a civilian, and who\r\ncherished a lively jealousy of the military officers, had reversed this\r\narrangement. The Sword was never quite reconciled to its degradation,\r\nand its feuds with the Pen went on until the French Royal Navy was\r\ndestroyed by the Revolution. While Colbert lived and the king was\r\nyoung, the central authority was strong enough to compel obedience,\r\nbut in later years all the parade of precision in the language of the\r\n_Ordonnance_, and all the power of the king, could not keep the civil\r\nand military officials from quarrelling, from disobeying orders, and\r\ndisputing the meaning of the most exactly worded regulations.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Sword was naturally the Admiral of France, who was\r\na member of the royal family, and except in the case of the Count\r\nof Toulouse, a dignified figurehead, and not an effective chief.\r\nHis administrative work was done by the Minister of Marine and the\r\nCouncil. Next to the Admiral came the two Vice-Admirals, _Du Levant_\r\nthe Mediterranean, and _Du Ponant_ the Ocean, who commanded in chief\r\nwhen he was absent, each in his own sea. The next rank was that\r\nof Lieutenant-General. We may say for purposes of comparison that\r\nthe Admiral of France answered to our Lord High Admiral, and the\r\nVice-Admirals to our Admirals, while the Lieutenants-General answered\r\nto our Vice-Admirals. Next came an officer happily unparalleled in our\r\nservice. This was the _Intendant des armées navales_, who is not to\r\nbe confounded with the _Intendant de marine_. He was a civilian who\r\naccompanied every French squadron, and had supreme authority over the\r\n_Commissaires_, or Pursers, and the civil work in all its branches. But\r\nhe had also a right to sit on councils of war, and was authorised to\r\nreport on the behaviour of the naval chief in action. The _Intendant\r\ndes armées navales_ was in fact a French equivalent for the Dutch\r\nField Deputies, and he acted in exactly the same way, by hampering\r\nthe fighting chief when he was an energetic man, and by reducing him\r\nto submission when he was a weak one, and of course by irritating and\r\nexaggerating the jealousies of the Pen and the Sword. He was a spy\r\nwhose word could make or mar the fortunes of a naval officer, and yet\r\nwas not a competent judge of the naval officer’s work. That Colbert\r\nshould have created such a rank, and that it should have been preserved\r\nby the very able men who succeeded him in the government of the French\r\nNavy, shows that they were all blinded by the professional jealousy of\r\nthe civil official for the fighting man, and by the Frenchman’s mania\r\nfor over-governing.\r\n\r\nThe next in rank was the Chef d’Escadre, Rear-Admiral or Commodore.\r\nThen we have another civil official, the _Commissaire Général à la\r\nsuite des armées navales_, a subordinate of the _Intendant des armées\r\nnavales_, who watched the Captain as his superior did the Admiral. The\r\norder of precedence in a French ship could not offer much novelty.\r\nThere was the Capitaine du Vaisseau, or Post-Captain, and the Capitaine\r\ndu Brûlot, or Captain of a fireship. The second in command was called\r\nthe Major. He commanded the soldiers in the ship’s company, and all\r\nlanding parties. Then came the Lieutenant, and after him the Enseigne.\r\nThe recruiting of the corps of officers was provided for by the _Gardes\r\nde la marine_. There were three companies of the Gardes: one at Brest,\r\none at Rochefort, and one at Toulon. They were mostly young men of\r\ngentle birth—that is, members of the _noblesse_ who had a right to\r\na coat of arms and to the privileges of their caste,—but members of\r\nrespectable families who had received the education of gentlemen were\r\nadmitted. They were supposed to receive a very thorough professional\r\ntraining, and to be drafted into the ships when qualified. The fact did\r\nnot always square with the theory. It was found that young gentlemen\r\nof good family and some influence were kept to their books with great\r\ndifficulty. A certain number of them did no doubt attain to a level\r\nof book-knowledge very rare among our officers, but the whole history\r\nof the eighteenth century is at hand to prove that as a class they\r\nwere inferior in practical capacity to the men brought up in the rough\r\nschool of the English Navy.\r\n\r\nThe crews were raised by the _classes_, the predecessors of the\r\n_Inscription maritime_, a great system of naval conscription. Like\r\nso much else in France, this also was founded by Richelieu, but it\r\nwas perfected by Lyonne and Colbert, and was finally established by\r\nthe _Ordonnance_ of 1689. All Frenchmen engaged in working in ships\r\nor boats throughout the whole coast of France, and on the banks of\r\nrivers large enough to carry a lighter, were held to be subject to\r\nserve in the _classes_. They were divided into seven, which were to\r\nserve successively for periods of four years. All seafaring men,\r\nwaterman or lighterman, were inscribed on the lists of the Commissioner\r\nof the District. During the four years of their liability to serve\r\nthe king they were not allowed to engage with private employers. It\r\nwas calculated that the total number subject to service was 60,000.\r\nThe obligation began at the age of ten, and lasted till the man was\r\ntoo old to work. As a compensation for this unlimited obligation a\r\nretaining fee was promised to men not serving, and those who had\r\nserved at sea were entitled to a small pension when their period of\r\nliability to service was over; while hospitals were established at\r\nall the ports, and employment in the dockyards was promised to all\r\nwho were so severely hurt as to be unable to go to sea, but were\r\nstill capable of doing some work. This famous institution exists in\r\na modified form to-day, and has often been the subject of admiration\r\namong ourselves. On paper it no doubt possessed immense advantages over\r\nour rough-and-ready system, or no system, of raising crews by bounties\r\nand impressment. Yet whenever the French Crown endeavoured to use all\r\nthe resources provided by the _classes_, the neatly constructed machine\r\nbroke down. The seafaring population rebelled against its severity, and\r\nin practice the king was constantly driven to impress men very much in\r\nthe English fashion, without regard to their class. In the last years\r\nof the reign of King Louis and until the Revolution, the financial\r\ndistress of the French Government made it impossible to provide half\r\npay, and the hospitals were neglected. The _classes_ was in fact a more\r\nuniform and grinding oppression than our own impressment, and was not\r\nmore efficient in producing crews.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the merit of the French organisation was altogether more\r\non paper than in reality. It looked very coherent and beautifully\r\ndivided, but its distinctions and divisions answered to no natural\r\nclassifications in the work to be done. For instance, to make the Sword\r\nresponsible for fitting out the ships and yet to leave the control of\r\nthe dockyards to the Pen was simply to provide for incessant conflicts\r\nof authority between the two, and to divide the responsibility. The\r\nEnglish system of putting a retired naval officer at the head of\r\nthe dockyard as Commissioner was incomparably simpler and better.\r\nIt is needless to point out that nothing could be more fatal to the\r\nindependence of character of an officer commanding a fleet than the\r\npresence of the _Intendant des armées navales_. But the spirit of the\r\n_Ordonnance_ is best shown by the article which forbade the captain to\r\nmake any kind of changes in the armament of his ship. It was no doubt\r\nnecessary to guard against mere eccentricity, but if such a regulation\r\nas this had been enforced in the English Navy it might never have had\r\nthe carronade, and would certainly have had to do without the many\r\nimprovements in gunnery introduced by Sir Charles Douglas in the last\r\nquarter of the eighteenth century. The _Ordonnance_ was full of that\r\nover-regulation which is the ruin of all independence of character and\r\noriginality of mind. Other faults the French Navy had which arose out\r\nof the social condition of France. The officers were one of the many\r\nprivileged corps which ended by destroying the French monarchy. They\r\nstood much on their rights, and were above all extremely jealous of the\r\nadmission of colleagues who were not of noble birth.\r\n\r\nWhen King William’s Government was able to settle down after the\r\nconfusion of the Revolution, one of its first duties was the reconquest\r\nof Ireland, which was still holding out for King James. Louis XIV. was\r\ngiving open support to his cousin, and war had really begun in March,\r\ntwo months before the formal declaration, when a French squadron under\r\nthe command of Louis Gabaret landed King James at Kinsale. The material\r\nforce at the disposal of the English Government was considerable. It\r\nconsisted of 173 vessels of 101,892 tons, carrying 6930 guns, and\r\nrequiring when fully manned 42,003 men. Of the 173 vessels 108 were\r\nrated. The rating of English ships, which had first been settled\r\naccording to the number of their crews, was now based on the number\r\nof guns. There were six rates in all—the first carrying 90 guns and\r\nupwards, the sixth 18 guns or less; unrated ships were little craft\r\nsuch as sloops, ketches, smacks, yachts, etc. With the help of the\r\nDutch fleet, this was more than enough to be a match for the French,\r\nbut Parliament was justly persuaded of the necessity for increasing\r\nthe Navy. In 1690 it voted £570,000, to be employed in the building of\r\n17 ships of 80 guns and 10 ships of 60. Three of 70 were also ordered\r\nto be built, making the total addition of 30 vessels. The 80-gun ships\r\nof that time were three-deckers, and of a burden of 1100 tons. The\r\n60-gun ships were of 900 tons. The time allowed for completing this\r\nlist was four years. In spite of the wear and tear of the war, and\r\nthe limited number of prizes we were able to take from the French,\r\nthe additions made to the navy in the reign of William III. were very\r\nconsiderable. It increased from 108 to 174 rated ships, and in tonnage\r\nfrom 101,000 to 158,999. The increase was greatest in vessels of the\r\nfourth and fifth rates—that is, in vessels carrying from 30 to 60 guns.\r\nThe political confusion of the early years of the king’s reign combined\r\nwith corruption to neutralise the material strength of the navy to some\r\nextent. It was the policy of the king to divide employments between the\r\ntwo parties to which he looked for support, the Whigs, and those Tories\r\nwho had accepted the Revolution. In pursuit of this policy his first\r\nBoard of Admiralty was chosen from both. Arthur Herbert, who was a\r\nTory, was made First Commissioner. Other members of the Board belonged\r\nto the same party, but it included William Sacheverell, who was a\r\nstrong Whig. The presence of men belonging to different factions in the\r\nsame governing body was sure to lead to dissensions, and it was not\r\nlong before the quarrels of the Admiralty Board became very violent.\r\nIn order to facilitate the manning of the fleet two new regiments of\r\nmarines were raised. The admiral’s regiment had been disbanded because\r\nit was suspected of being too much attached to the deposed king. The\r\nnew corps were formally established in 1690, but the work of recruiting\r\nthem was begun in 1689. They were raised by Herbert, who had been\r\ncreated Earl of Torrington after an action about to be mentioned, and\r\nby the Earl of Pembroke, and were named, according to the custom of the\r\ntime, after their colonels. By the first establishment they were to\r\nconsist of 12 companies each of 200 men; but the number of companies\r\nwas afterwards increased to 15.\r\n\r\nAs for the sailors, it is needless to say that they were raised in\r\nthe usual manner. Although much was done for the officers in this\r\nreign, the men were no better paid than before. Their wages remained\r\nthroughout the century at the figure fixed in the reign of Charles\r\nII., and were not increased till a rise was extorted by the mutinies\r\nof 1797. The main grievance of the seamen was not so much the amount\r\nas the irregular payment of their wages. In the earlier times after\r\nthe Revolution they were kept waiting because the Government was in\r\nwant of money, but the system of pay subjected them to long delays\r\neven when the resources at the disposal of the Government were ample.\r\nIt had been the custom in the old days of the Winter and Summer Guard\r\nto pay the men only at the end of the commission. This was no hardship\r\nwhen the term of service lasted only a few months. But the practice\r\nwas continued when we had begun to maintain fleets abroad for years\r\ntogether. In King William’s reign the injustice did not reach the\r\nheight it was destined to attain later on, yet the men were often\r\ndriven to sell their pay tickets at a heavy discount because the\r\ndistresses of the Treasury, or the delays due to a complicated system\r\nof accounts, kept them waiting during months for their hard-earned\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the officers who had served King James passed over to\r\nhis successor. A few, indeed, followed the exiled king, and among them\r\nwas Sir Roger Strickland, who as a Roman Catholic was disqualified for\r\noffice. Captain David Lloyd also adhered to his master, and was very\r\nbusy during the years next ensuing in endeavouring to shake the new\r\nallegiance of his former brother-officers. In this, however, he had\r\nno success. In spite of discontent, and although some naval officers\r\nendeavoured to provide for their own safety in case of a restoration by\r\nsending promises to King James, the navy as a whole remained loyal.\r\n\r\nThe war now beginning lasted with an interval of truce between 1697\r\nand 1702, until the signing of the Peace of Utrecht, in the reign\r\nof Queen Anne. It was in reality one continuous war waged by Europe\r\nin self-defence, and by France for the purpose of establishing the\r\npredominance of the house of Bourbon. The naval part of this struggle\r\nis divided into two periods. During the first, which lasted to the\r\nclose of 1793, the French king kept great fleets at sea. After that\r\ndate the exhaustion of his treasury through the calls made upon it by\r\nthe land war rendered him incapable of meeting the allies at sea with\r\nequal forces. He was driven by penury to lay up his ships, and the\r\nwar on the side of France was conducted by privateers. In this second\r\nperiod the allied fleets still kept the sea, swept the French coast,\r\nand co-operated with the armies.\r\n\r\nWhen hostilities began in 1689, the first object of the French was to\r\ngive assistance to King James in Ireland. The first duty of the English\r\nwas to defeat his efforts, and then to cover the passage of our own\r\nforces. The Dutch had to protect their own commerce and to co-operate\r\nwith us in the general purposes of the war.\r\n\r\nThe news that the French king was about to supply his cousin with the\r\nmeans of passing over to Ireland reached London early in March. A\r\nsquadron was prepared to sail for the purpose of intercepting Gabaret,\r\nbut it started too late. Herbert, who went in command without resigning\r\nhis place as First Commissioner of the Admiralty, did not reach\r\nCork until the 17th of April. All he could do now was to intercept\r\nwhatever further help the French might be sending to the assistance\r\nof the Jacobites. He knew that a force was preparing at Brest under\r\nthe command of the Count of Châteaurenault. Not finding any sign of\r\nthis expedition on the coast of Ireland, Herbert stood over to Brest.\r\nEither at this time, or shortly afterwards, he detached George Rooke\r\nwith a small squadron to the west of Scotland, for the double purpose\r\nof rendering what help he could to the Protestants of Ulster and\r\npreventing the French from sending help to the Scottish Jacobites. The\r\nwind was easterly on the coast of France, and Herbert failed to reach\r\nBrest in time, or to approach it close enough to prevent Châteaurenault\r\nfrom sailing with a fleet of vessels of from 40 to 60 guns, 5\r\nfireships, and a number of transports carrying 6000 soldiers. Finding\r\nthat the French had escaped him, Herbert returned to the south coast of\r\nIreland, and was off Cork on the 29th April. The French fleet were seen\r\nin the neighbourhood of Kinsale, and Herbert stood in to place himself\r\nbetween them and the coast. Châteaurenault made no attempt to land at\r\nKinsale, but steered west for Bantry. At Baltimore, Herbert obtained\r\ninformation of his enemy’s destination. He at once pursued, but on\r\nrounding Cape Clear caught sight of the Frenchmen heading for Bantry\r\nBay. This was on the afternoon of the 30th of April. The day being far\r\nadvanced, Herbert did not follow Châteaurenault at once, but lay to all\r\nthe night. The force under his command is variously stated as nineteen\r\nand twenty-two ships of the line. The average size of the English ships\r\nwas about the same as the French.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May the wind was blowing off the land. Châteaurenault had\r\ndisembarked as many of the soldiers as were carried in the men-of-war\r\non the previous evening. But the transports were still undischarged,\r\nand had not yet been able to work up to the town of Bantry. Seeing\r\nthat the English were somewhat, though not much, inferior in number\r\nto himself, the French admiral came to the very proper decision to\r\nengage. He got under way about half-past eleven, and stood down the\r\nBay. As he had the weather-gage, he had the choice of attack. Herbert\r\nlay to to receive him. At the moment of getting under way the French\r\nfleet was in order of convoy, that is, in three parallel columns;\r\nChâteaurenault himself in the middle, with the van division under the\r\ncommand of Gabaret on one side, and the rear commanded by Forant on\r\nthe other. When the order to draw into a line of battle was given,\r\nGabaret should have stood on ahead, leaving a sufficient space for the\r\nadmiral’s division between himself and Forant. But he moved so slowly\r\nand kept his wind at such a distance from the enemy that Châteaurenault\r\nin a fit of impatience crowded on sail, ran between the van division\r\nand the English, and took the place of van himself, thus leaving\r\nGabaret to fall in behind and form the centre. In consequence of these\r\nmisunderstandings the French line was in considerable disorder, which\r\nwas increased by the fact that the narrow water of Bantry Bay left\r\nlittle room for manœuvring, and that the fleet was speedily compelled\r\nto tack. It would appear that these conditions ought to have afforded\r\nHerbert an opportunity for working to windward and forcing a close\r\naction with the enemy. It is, indeed, asserted that he made an attempt\r\nto gain the weather-gage, and could not do so because the French kept\r\ntheir wind so carefully. Thus the battle was confined to artillery fire\r\nat a considerable distance, and no great harm was done on either side.\r\nThe French make an unfounded claim to have sunk an English ship. On the\r\nother hand, it is allowed that the French _Diamant_, Captain Coëtlogon,\r\nwas set on fire. The biographer of Sir John Leake, who served in the\r\nbattle as commander of the fireship =Firedrake=, claims the honour of\r\nthis achievement for his hero. He says that the feat was performed\r\nby a “cushee piece” invented by Leake’s father, the Master-gunner of\r\nEngland. But the cushee piece was never heard of again, as Captain John\r\nLeake judged it to be as dangerous to its friends as its enemies, for\r\nwhich independence of judgment he was badly treated in the will of his\r\nindignant parent. The two fleets continued onwards in a disorderly way\r\nand firing at one another over a distance of twenty-one miles till they\r\nwere off Dursey Head, then Châteaurenault, finding that he was being\r\ndrawn out to sea, and remembering that he was answerable for the safety\r\nof the transports, returned to Bantry Bay. Herbert, satisfied that\r\nenough had been done, made for the general rendezvous of the fleet near\r\nthe Scilly Isles, thereby leaving Châteaurenault free to complete the\r\ndisembarkation of his soldiers, collect his transports, and return to\r\nBrest. His whole expedition had lasted only for eleven days, and was\r\nconsidered by the French a glorious success.\r\n\r\nThis estimate shows that the French took a modest view of what\r\nconstituted success in naval operations. Châteaurenault, if he had\r\npushed his attack home on Herbert, might have had some English prizes\r\nto show, and might have greatly encouraged the enemies of England,\r\nbesides landing his soldiers and bringing off his transports. But he\r\nat least had some case. What is extraordinary, when we think what\r\nhad been once the standard of the English navy, was that Herbert\r\nbragged of having gained a victory because he had not been routed by\r\nan enemy of slightly superior force, and that his countrymen, instead\r\nof laughing at him, or asking indignantly why he did not fight again,\r\nthrew up their caps and huzzaed. The battle, and the praise given it,\r\nwere melancholy signs of the poorness of spirit which had come over\r\nEnglishmen since the Second Dutch War. It was the beginning of a dull\r\nmethod of doing work in the navy, happily never universal, but much\r\ntoo common, during the next half century or more. We see the French\r\nadmiral intent on carrying out some operation other than attacking the\r\nEnglish fleet, fighting a little, but with great care not to fight\r\nseriously. Opposite him is the English admiral, who has no idea that a\r\ndecisive battle is possible unless the enemy is good enough to supply\r\nhim with one, and perfectly ready to go off so soon as a few broken\r\nspars give him an excuse for saying enough has been done. Herbert\r\nwent on from Scilly to Portsmouth. The king may not in his heart have\r\nthought much of the battle, but he knew the necessity of pleasing the\r\nnaval officers and the great Tory party. He therefore professed himself\r\nsatisfied, knighted two of the captains, John Ashby and Cloudesley\r\nShovell, and made Herbert Earl of Torrington.\r\n\r\nRooke, on being detached by Herbert, had gone on at once to the west\r\nof Scotland. He was in the estuary of the Clyde in May, and for\r\nabout a month was very active against King James’s partisan in the\r\nislands. On the 8th of June he was called off to escort Kirke, who\r\nhad been detached with a body of troops for the purpose of raising\r\nthe siege of Londonderry. Rooke’s squadron consisted of five vessels,\r\none of which was the =Dartmouth=, now under the command of Leake,\r\nwho had been promoted for his use of the cushee piece on the 1st of\r\nMay. The squadron anchored in Rathlin Bay, and from thence went off\r\nto Lough Foyle, whence there is a clear waterway up to Londonderry.\r\nFrom what happened a month later, it may be taken for granted that\r\nnothing whatever prevented the smaller ships from being carried up to\r\nLondonderry, nothing, that is, except a want of goodwill and manhood on\r\nthe part of Kirke and Rooke. Unfortunately, they were wanting. Rooke\r\nwas indeed a brave man who did gallant service in later years. But his\r\nconduct in these weeks was not worthy of his later reputation. Kirke\r\nwas a drunken, violent, foul-mouthed ruffian. It is idle to speculate\r\nwhat was passing in his head. He may not have been a mere coward, but\r\nhe acted as if he had some hidden reason for not exerting himself. He\r\nheld a council of war on board the =Swallow=, and it was decided that\r\nas there were not troops enough to operate against the enemy outside\r\nthe town, nothing could be done, as if it would not have been much\r\nto carry provisions and a reinforcement of men into Londonderry. He\r\nretired to the Island of Inch, and there remained perfectly quiescent.\r\nRooke in the meantime cruised in search of French privateers and\r\nJacobite prizes. Whatever his motives may have been, his actions\r\nwere those of a man who thought it no shame to fill his own pockets\r\nby prize-hunting while his countrymen were starving and fighting in\r\ndesperation on the turf walls of Londonderry. At last, under the\r\ninfluence of pressing orders from England, it was decided to do\r\nsomething, and something was done in a way which covers with ignominy\r\nthe memory of the officers who did not dare to act before. During\r\nthe month of delay, due to their sloth or half-hearted treason, the\r\nbesiegers had had time to throw up batteries on the banks of the Foyle,\r\nand to draw a boom across the river below Londonderry. The operation\r\nwas therefore more difficult than it had been, and yet it was done with\r\nno great loss. On the 26th July the =Dartmouth= was told off to break\r\nthe boom, and convoy two victuallers, the =Mountjoy= and the =Phœnix=,\r\nsmall vessels both belonging to Londonderry. Leake performed his\r\nwork in a thoroughly officer-like fashion. So soon as the flood-tide\r\nbegan to run, and there was water enough to float the =Dartmouth= and\r\nvictuallers, he stood into the mouth of the Foyle, with the =Mountjoy=\r\nand =Phœnix=, towing behind him the long boat of the =Swallow=. The\r\nIrish batteries opened fire, but the little squadron held on steadily,\r\nthe =Dartmouth= giving all the cover she could to the merchant ships.\r\nTheir progress was slow for the wind was light, and the tide was not\r\nyet running strongly. The =Mountjoy= reached the boom first, and was\r\nsteered straight at it by her skipper Browning. The victualler had\r\nnot enough way to break through the obstacle. She recoiled from the\r\nboom and tailed on shore, that is to say, she grounded stern first.\r\nThe Irish raised a yell of gratification, and rushed down to the bank,\r\nwhere they opened a heavy fire on the =Mountjoy=. Browning was shot\r\ndead, but his men fired a broadside on the crowd. The shock, aided by\r\nthe tide, floated the =Mountjoy=. In the meantime the long-boat towed\r\nby the =Dartmouth= had rowed up to the boom, and, undeterred by the\r\nmusket fire from the banks, had cut through the ropes which held the\r\nspars together, and had made an opening. Then she towed the =Phœnix=\r\nin. The =Mountjoy= and the =Dartmouth= easily forced their way through\r\nthe loosened spars. The disheartened besiegers broke up their camp and\r\nmarched away. It was a gallant piece of work, well done by Leake and\r\nthe merchant skippers, but the ease, and the trifling cost with which\r\nit was done, are lasting reproaches to Kirke and Rooke.\r\n\r\nAfter the relief of Londonderry, Rooke had other important work to do\r\nin the Irish Sea. In August he covered the transport of Schomberg’s\r\narmy to Ireland, and co-operated in the capture of Carrickfergus. Then\r\nhe cruised down the coast, threatening the towns held for King James,\r\nand landing where the enemy was not too strong to be attacked. As the\r\nautumn drew on, and his ships became foul, Rooke came round to the\r\nDowns, and his squadron was laid up for the winter. In the meantime,\r\nthe Grand Fleet of combined English and Dutch had cruised in the\r\nChannel under the command of Herbert, who was joined by Edward Russell.\r\nThey looked into Brest, and cruised at the mouth of the Channel,\r\ngoing every now and then into Torbay for provisions. There were many\r\ncomplaints of the want of beer. At last, when the autumn had begun, the\r\nGrand Fleet also came back, and was laid up. It was still not thought\r\nprudent to keep the great ships out late in the autumn.\r\n\r\nOn a general survey of the operations of the year it cannot be said\r\nthat either party had displayed much energy. The French fleet had done\r\nnothing proportionate to its pretensions and its paper strength. In\r\n1692, the King of France was believed to possess 110 rated ships and\r\n690 other vessels of war. This figure is of course absurd, unless we\r\nare to suppose that it included all the lighters and row boats employed\r\nin his harbours. The fleet carried 14,670 cannon, and was manned\r\nby 2500 officers and 97,500 men. We may presume that this estimate\r\ncovers the dockyard workmen. Ninety-seven thousand five hundred men\r\nwas more than the whole number of Frenchmen liable to be drawn by the\r\n_classes_, and it is very doubtful whether the French king ever had the\r\nservice at sea of one-half of them at any given moment. Still, when\r\nall deductions are allowed for, this was a great force. It had done\r\nnothing in proportion to its size. There would have been no difficulty,\r\nconsidering that all Ireland except the north was in the hands of\r\nKing James, in establishing a naval station at Bantry Bay, or even\r\nat Dublin, and from either of these ports the French could have done\r\nsomething effectual to stop the passage of Schomberg’s army. They were\r\ncontent to land their troops in Ireland, and then to return. But we\r\ncertainly did very little to prevent them, and the feeble conduct of\r\nHerbert in the action of Bantry Bay promised very ill for the future.\r\n\r\nThe winter afforded the English Government an opportunity to prepare\r\nfor a vigorous campaign, but it was neglected. The first joy over\r\nthe Revolution was followed by a reaction. The two sections of the\r\nvictorious party, the Whig and the Tory, began to quarrel and to\r\nstruggle for predominance. These factions were nowhere more acutely\r\nfelt than at the Admiralty. It is said by several authorities, and\r\ndenied by nobody, that Herbert had fallen back into the dissolute\r\nhabits of his early life. He was addicted to excesses which are\r\nruinous to a man’s nerve and energy. It is certain that the work of\r\nthe Admiralty was so badly done that the French privateers were very\r\nsuccessful against our trade. In the new establishment of pay, made in\r\n1694, it was said that the increase of salary was given in order that\r\nthe officers might no longer be able to make their poverty an excuse\r\nfor not doing their duty. Given the moral level of the Restoration and\r\nthe Revolution, it is not incredible that captains, who were sulky\r\nat the loss of their table money, did refuse to exert themselves\r\nin defence of the merchant ships unless they were bribed. The old\r\ncomplaints of bad rations, bad pay, and bad beer were loud in the\r\nfleet. At last it was found necessary to make a change at headquarters.\r\nThe existing Board of Admiralty was dissolved, and replaced by another\r\nwith the Earl of Pembroke at its head. Torrington was very indignant,\r\nand threatened to resign the command of the fleet in the Channel. He\r\nwas pacified with gifts, and then showed his zeal as an officer by\r\nstaying in London to enjoy himself. He afterwards said that he had\r\nwarned the Government that a larger fleet must be prepared, but did\r\nnot take the effectual step of insisting upon resigning unless he was\r\nsupplied with sufficient force.\r\n\r\nA strong fleet was indeed necessary, for the French king had at last\r\ndecided on making a serious attack in the Channel. His Toulon squadron\r\nwas to be brought round from the Mediterranean, and was to join the\r\nVice-Admiral _du Ponant_, the Count de Tourville, at Brest. Then the\r\nwhole force, which was intended to reach the imposing figure of 78\r\nships of the line, 30 fireships, and 15 galleys, besides frigates and\r\nother attendant small craft, was to come into the Channel. The French\r\nGovernment, exaggerating the meaning of the discontent in England, was\r\nunder the impression that a Jacobite rising would take place upon the\r\nappearance of the French fleet. On our side there was no understanding\r\nof the gravity of the coming crisis. In March Admiral Killigrew was\r\ndispatched with thirteen sail of the line and two fireships to protect\r\nthe Mediterranean convoy. He was joined by some Dutch men-of-war.\r\nThe combined squadron met with bad weather, and put into Cadiz on\r\nthe 3rd of April. While lying here Killigrew received information\r\nthat Châteaurenault was to be expected shortly on his way out to the\r\nocean. Killigrew left Cadiz, and went into Gibraltar Bay, where he\r\nwas joined by Captain Skelton, who was also on convoy duty with six\r\nships. The combined force stood over to the Barbary coast to look for\r\nChâteaurenault, who might be supposed to be likely to hug the shore of\r\nAfrica in order to escape observation. The common fate of our fleets\r\nat that time attended this operation. Killigrew was too late. On\r\nthe 11th of May, Châteaurenault was seen outside the allied fleets.\r\nKilligrew pursued, but his ships were foul with long cruising, perhaps\r\nby neglect, for some of them had not been cleaned for seventeen months.\r\nThe French squadron easily outsailed its pursuers. Killigrew then\r\nreturned to Cadiz, and collected the trade before returning home. He\r\nreached England at the beginning of July and there heard of a disaster\r\nfurther up channel, which left him no resource but to carry his ship\r\ninto the Hamoaze, and there take shelter behind batteries.\r\n\r\nThis disaster was the Battle of Beachy Head, which the French call the\r\nBattle of Bévisier, a corruption of Pevensey Bay. As the year grew\r\non, the English Government became aware that a large French force\r\nmight soon be expected in the Channel. The crisis was a very dangerous\r\none, since the king had sailed for Ireland with all the best troops.\r\nThere were few left in England, and the discontent of the Jacobites\r\nwas notorious. The naval preparations made to meet an enemy were\r\ninsufficient. When Torrington was at last sent down to Portsmouth on\r\nthe 28th May there were but thirty-two English ships and eighteen Dutch\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nTourville had sailed from Brest on the 13th of June. The reinforcements\r\nbrought him by Châteaurenault raised his fleet to something over\r\nseventy ships of the line, with thirty fireships and some small craft.\r\nHe sailed into the Channel, and his approach was first known to\r\nTorrington on the 22nd. The English admiral was completely surprised\r\nby the appearance of the enemy. At a later period, when his conduct\r\nwas called into question, he endeavoured to throw the blame for his\r\nwant of knowledge on the ministers, who, as he complained, had not\r\nsent him down till the last of May, when it was too late for him to\r\nstation look-out ships off Brest. It does not, however, appear why\r\nhe thought it necessary to stay in London till he was driven out by\r\na special order. After the change in the Admiralty Board he had no\r\nofficial duties in the capital, and if he stayed there till he earned\r\nfrom the sailors the nickname of Lord Tarry-in-Town, it was presumably\r\nbecause he did not wish to leave. Even so, he was with the fleet on\r\nthe 30th of May, and might have detached look-out ships to the mouth\r\nof the Channel. He said he did, and then immediately afterwards said\r\nhe did not, because all his frigates were engaged in shipping Lord\r\nPembroke’s newly raised regiment of marines. The Dutch, to whom he\r\nentrusted the duty, without taking the trouble to see whether it were\r\nexecuted, were too busy shipping their stores to have leisure for\r\nanything else. The allied fleet, in fact, presented a picture of sloth\r\nand carelessness. When the enemy was known to be in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood, it weighed anchor, and dropped down to Dunnose. Here\r\nit was joined by two English and three Dutch ships of the line, which\r\nraised it to fifty-five. Torrington anchored and remained at anchor\r\nuntil the 25th. On that day he again weighed with the wind at N.E. and\r\non the afternoon sighted the French to the south of the Isle of Wight.\r\nThey were much scattered, and some of them were far to leeward. In\r\nsuch circumstances Monk would at once have attacked the enemy within\r\nstriking distance in the hope of crippling him severely before he could\r\nbe reinforced. Torrington drew his fleet into a line of battle and\r\nmade towards the enemy. But he soon came to the conclusion that “they\r\nhad enough in a body to have given us more than sufficient work.” He\r\ncould not understand why they had not attacked him. It is probable that\r\nthey abstained because he was to windward and they were scattered. To\r\nMonk the fact that the enemy was shy would have been an extra reason\r\nfor attacking. To Torrington it only suggested dismal reflections as to\r\nwhat might happen if the French became enterprising, and therefore he\r\nretired. During the 26th he worked back from the south of the Isle of\r\nWight to the N.E. A letter which he wrote on this day to the Council\r\nis marked on every line with glee over the embarrassment the crisis\r\nwas likely to cause to his political opponents. He did indeed say that\r\nhe would watch the enemy, and get to westward of them if he could; but\r\nbefore this he had expressed his opinion that the best course was to\r\nfall back to the Gunfleet, and then the ships from the west might come\r\nup to Portsmouth, and join him over the “Flats,” that is the shallows\r\nat the mouth of the Thames. The ships from the west were Killigrew’s\r\nsquadron. Torrington knew that they had been cruising and must be foul,\r\nand it was certainly within his knowledge that they were less numerous\r\nthan his own fleet. Yet he proposed to subject them to the risk of\r\npassing the French fleet, which he thought too great to be run by\r\nhimself. This was not how Tromp had behaved when he united the fleets\r\nof the Maas and the Texel in defiance of Monk at the end of the First\r\nDutch War.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that there are two types of fighting man. The first when\r\nin presence of the enemy instinctively thinks, “How can I strike with\r\nthe most effect.” The great race are of this type. To it belong Blake\r\nand Monk, Hawke, Hood, Nelson, and their like, among our admirals;\r\nand, among our enemies, Tromp, De Ruyter, and Suffren. Then there is\r\nanother kind of fighting man who may be brave enough personally, but\r\nwho, when he is a commander, instinctively says, “How can I prevent the\r\nenemy from hurting me.” This kind of leader has fortunately been rare\r\nwith us at sea, but Herbert was of the race, and so was Byng. Such men\r\nare always looking over their shoulders, always making the most of the\r\nenemy’s force, always exaggerating the defects of their own command.\r\nThey seek for excuses to do nothing, and when they do come to the\r\nresolution to fight, the opposite determination to retreat forms itself\r\nunderneath, as it were spontaneously. This was the natural tendency of\r\nHerbert as he had already shown in Bantry Bay, and it was strengthened\r\nby his wish to punish those political rivals in London who had refused\r\nto take his advice, and had turned him out of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nWhen his letter of the 26th reached the Council it was not unnaturally\r\ninterpreted by them as indicating a wish to retire to the Gunfleet at\r\nonce. This may have been a mistake, but an admiral who said that he\r\nhad “heartily given God thanks” that the enemy declined battle, and\r\nadded, “I shall not think myself very unhappy if I can get rid of them\r\nwithout fighting,” had no ground to complain if he was thought to be\r\nwanting in spirit. No member of the Council was more bitter against\r\nHerbert than his brother seaman Edward Russell, a rancorous man, and\r\nan extreme Whig. He was very probably moved by jealousy, but the queen\r\nand the civil members of the Council can hardly be severely blamed\r\nfor not entirely trusting one admiral, when another admiral condemned\r\nhim without stint. On general grounds the Council was justified in\r\nexpecting more energy from Torrington. The danger was not that a\r\ngreat French army could land, this the queen’s counsellors knew to be\r\nimpossible, but that a small corps of French troops might be thrown\r\non shore which could act as a rallying point to the partizans of King\r\nJames. It was a great object to rouse the general patriotic feeling\r\nof the country, and there was no more effectual method of doing that\r\nthan a battle. The case was one in which it was better to fight, and be\r\nbeaten, than not to fight at all. A letter was written in the queen’s\r\nname to Torrington. It was worded with no apparent want of confidence,\r\nand it left him free not to fight if he preferred; but it ordered him\r\nstrictly not to lose sight of the French, to get to windward of them if\r\nhe could, but to fight on the first advantage rather than to go to the\r\nGunfleet.\r\n\r\nThe letter reached Torrington on the 29th of June. He called a council\r\nof war which agreed with him that it implied an order to fight on the\r\nfirst advantage. A previous council of war had confirmed his opinion\r\nthat it was better not to fight. It may be laid down as a general rule\r\nthat a council of war is a mere blind for the commander-in-chief. When\r\nit does not consist of his dependants it must still necessarily be full\r\nof his inferiors in rank, who have been trained by the habits of their\r\nlife not to contradict the commanding officer. Besides, when he wants\r\nto fight, it looks cowardly to recommend retreat, and, when he wants\r\nto retreat, it looks like a reflection on his courage to insist upon\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\nThe fleet was now lying off Beachy Head some nine or ten miles to the\r\nsouth. The enemy again were some eighteen miles off to the S.W. The\r\nfleet weighed anchor at nine o’clock at night, and remained beating\r\nto and fro till daybreak. The wind was off the shore. The enemy also\r\nwas under way at sundown, but at two o’clock in the morning Tourville\r\nwas heard to fire guns as a signal to anchor. The sound was heard and\r\nunderstood in the English fleet. An opportunity now presented itself\r\nfor slipping between the French and the land, and getting to the\r\nwestward of them for the sake of joining Killigrew. Tromp would have\r\nmade a push, but Torrington seems to have been in a dogged and stupid\r\nmood with no very fixed intention in his mind, save to make all the\r\ntrouble he could for other people. At daybreak the fleet had not much\r\naltered its position. Beachy Head was still twelve miles to the N.E.\r\nand the French were visible at anchor to the south. At four o’clock\r\nthe signal was made to form the line, and at eight o’clock the “bloody\r\nflag,” the red flag hoisted at the fore-topmast-head, which was the\r\nsignal to engage the enemy, was run up in the flagship. Two vessels had\r\njoined Torrington since he left Dunnose. His total force now consisted\r\nof thirty-five English, and twenty-two Dutch. According to the order\r\nestablished for the fleet, the Dutch led when it was upon the starboard\r\ntack. As the wind was N.E. and the enemy to the South and West, the\r\nfleet bore down with the wind on the right quarter, the Dutch led.\r\nTorrington himself was in the centre with the Red Squadron, with Sir\r\nJohn Ashby between him and the Dutch, and Sir George Rooke between him\r\nand the Blue Squadron in the rear. Sir Ralph Delaval commanded the Blue\r\nSquadron. The fleet it must be understood was not perpendicular, but\r\nparallel to the enemy though a little behind him. Thus the ships of\r\nthe allied fleet had to bear down on the French in a number of lines\r\nwhich struck upon them at an angle, but were parallel to one another.\r\nWhen the allied fleet was seen to be approaching, the French weighed\r\nanchor and lay with their heads pointing to N. of W. in a long concave\r\nline. The official French list gives seventy-two vessels present in\r\nthe line, but the English counted that there were thirty-four ahead\r\nof the French admiral and forty-eight behind him. In this there was\r\nprobably exaggeration, and perhaps downright lying. Tourville himself\r\nhad his flag in the _Soleil Royale_, a magnificent ship of 110 guns.\r\nThe van was commanded by the Lieutenant-General Châteaurenault and\r\nLieutenant-General the Marquis de Villette Mursay. The rear was under\r\nthe command of Count D’Estrées, Vice-Admiral _du levant_, and the\r\nLieutenant-General Gabaret, who had been promoted after the action of\r\nBantry Bay.\r\n\r\nFire began at nine o’clock when the Dutch ships under Admiral\r\nCullemburg came into action with the French van. Owing to the\r\ninferiority of the allies in numbers there was a danger that as they\r\ncould not stretch all along the line of the French fleet some of the\r\nships in the French line would turn to windward, and put either the\r\nDutch or the English, according to circumstances, between two fires.\r\nThe danger was one which De Ruyter had had to face in the battles of\r\n1672 and 1673, and he had provided for it by telling off a squadron to\r\nwatch the enemy’s van and had then thrown the bulk of his own force\r\non the rear. It shows how useless experience is to naturally stupid\r\nmen, that although all the senior officers present had served either\r\nwith, or against, De Ruyter, none of them thought of following his\r\nexample. All the allied leaders could do was to endeavour to get as\r\nnear as they could to stretching themselves out to the same length\r\nas the enemy by sending the van down against the French van; by\r\nkeeping the Red Division opposite the enemy’s centre; and by leaving\r\nthe attack on the rear to Sir Ralph Delaval. While they were bearing\r\ndown, Herbert changed his mind once, or twice, as to the exact point\r\nof the enemy’s line he wished to reach, and altered the course of his\r\nship accordingly. The result was that Sir John Ashby became puzzled\r\nas to the intentions of his commander-in-chief, and finally ended by\r\nattaching himself to the Dutch. In the end Torrington placed himself\r\nopposite the rear of the French centre so that there came a gap between\r\nhim and Ashby. Being afraid that the French would stand out of their\r\nown line, in order to pass through this opening, Herbert kept his ships\r\na good distance from the enemy so that he might be the better placed to\r\nhead off such as attended this movement. As the French began to move\r\nahead slowly, just as the allies came down, the Dutch could not get\r\nabreast of the leading ship, and struck on them at the ninth.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch began to fire at nine, Sir Ralph Delaval at half-past nine,\r\nand the centre at ten. At the two extremities the fighting was hot. Sir\r\nRalph Delaval pressed eagerly on the squadron of Count D’Estrées, and\r\npushed his attack with such energy that the enemy seemed to flinch.\r\nSir John Ashby in the van found himself abreast of Tourville. He fired\r\ntwo guns in order to see whether the Vice-Admiral _du Ponant_ would\r\nbe a “reasonable enemy.” Tourville disdained to strike first at his\r\ninferior in rank, and it was not until Ashby’s first broadside had been\r\ndelivered that the _Soleil Royal_ opened fire. The wind, which had been\r\nstrong in the early morning was still blowing a good breeze. It was\r\nused by the ships at the head of the French line to work to windward.\r\nBetween eleven and twelve o’clock they succeeded in doubling on the\r\nDutch and putting them between two fires. Admiral Cullemburg’s squadron\r\nfought gallantly but was overpowered. What had happened was seen on\r\nthe centre and rear. Torrington’s attention was called to the movement\r\nby his flag-captain who asked if he also intended to allow himself to\r\nbe weathered. He answered that he did not, and began at once to work\r\nup to windward. As Sir Ralph Delaval had pressed closely on D’Estrées,\r\nhe had fallen to leeward of the commander-in-chief, and there was an\r\n“elbow” in the English line. By two o’clock the wind fell away to a\r\ndead calm and movement became restricted on either side to what could\r\nbe done by towing, or drifting along with the tide. Cannonading went on\r\nbetween the two stationary fleets for some time. At last the ebb-tide\r\nset up a strong westerly current. The Dutch dropped anchor with all\r\nsails set. As the French were not seamen enough to do the same thing\r\nthey drifted to the west. One Dutch ship which was too much damaged to\r\nanchor floated away, and became a prize. Then Herbert drifted down to\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Dutch and anchored close by them. The allies\r\nremained at anchor, till the easterly current began to flow with the\r\nflood-tide in the evening. Then they got up anchor and tided eastwards\r\ntowards the Thames. The pursuit of Tourville was timid. He followed\r\nnext day, but in line of battle which limited the speed of his fleet to\r\nthat of the slowest vessel in it. To this timidity Torrington owed his\r\nsafety from complete destruction. A few of the more severely crippled\r\nDutch and English vessels were set on fire, but the great bulk of the\r\nallied fleet got safely into the Thames.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent movements of Tourville may be dismissed in a few lines.\r\nHe remained in the Channel until the early days of August, ranging at\r\nwill up and down and of course paralysing commerce, but he did nothing\r\nmore against our coast than burn the little town of Teignmouth in\r\nSouth Devon. There was nothing in fact that he could do. The Jacobite\r\nrising did not take place because he had no troops to land to help the\r\ncountry gentlemen, who were resolved not to move until they were secure\r\nagainst being attacked by the Government’s forces before they were\r\nsufficiently organised to offer any resistance. In August Tourville\r\nreturned quietly to Brest. There had been a furious outbreak of anger\r\nin the country against Torrington and a great movement of patriotism\r\nwhich was unspeakably to the advantage of King William’s government.\r\nYet when Torrington was brought to trial in December he was acquitted.\r\nThe acquittal was intelligible. King William’s victory at the Boyne,\r\ngained just after the battle of Beachy Head, had put the country into\r\ngood humour, and the admiral’s most bitter accusers were the Dutch who\r\nwere not popular in England. But it was none the less a misfortune.\r\nTorrington had not done his utmost. His position indeed was a difficult\r\none, but it was not worse than Monk’s in 1666, or De Ruyter’s in 1672,\r\n’73, and he had not behaved as these men had done. When a court martial\r\ncould find no fault with his management it lowered the whole standard\r\nof conduct expected of an English naval officer. It showed that a man\r\nwho leaned to the side of timidity would not be condemned by other\r\nofficers. Then, too, the court, which could see nothing to blame in\r\nhis feeble effort of attack on the 30th June, must have been composed\r\nof men of a lower level of intelligence than the sea chiefs, whether\r\nDutch, or English of the previous wars. It laid the foundation of that\r\npedantic adherence to the line and the practice of engaging from van to\r\nrear which afterwards led to the monstrous sentence on Admiral Mathews,\r\nto the helpless weakness of Byng, and to the stupidity of Graves.\r\nPerhaps the ugliest feature of the whole transaction was this, that the\r\nEnglish excused Torrington very largely on the ground that the chief\r\nsufferers in the battle had been the Dutch. There was something very\r\nbase in the code of honour of people who did not think it ignoble to\r\nthrow the burden of battle on an ally.\r\n\r\nWhile Tourville was ranging the Channel the English government had\r\nfitted out a fresh armament. It was put under the combined command\r\nof Sir Richard Haddock, Sir John Ashby, and Admiral Killigrew. This\r\nfleet could, however, do little. The French were no longer at sea, and\r\nthe great ships were laid up as usual before the beginning of autumn.\r\nYet one good piece of service was done before the year was closed.\r\nMarlborough had suggested that an expedition might be sent to act\r\nagainst the partisans of King James in the south of Ireland. The scheme\r\nwas approved by King William, and Marlborough sailed in September,\r\nunder an escort of third and fourth rates commanded by the admirals.\r\nCork was taken on the 29th September, and the bulk of the ships then\r\nreturned to the Channel, leaving a few to co-operate with Marlborough\r\nin the attack on Kinsale. This completed the expedition. A separate\r\nsquadron of ships had cruised during this year on the coast of Ireland,\r\nunder the command of Sir Cloudesley Shovell, and had co-operated in the\r\ntaking of Duncannon.\r\n\r\nIn this year the French had again made very little use of their naval\r\nforce. In spite of Tourville’s victorious cruise in the Channel, the\r\nEnglish cause had advanced as a whole. King James had been beaten from\r\nthe north and east of Ireland, and deprived of two very important ports\r\nin the south. That this was so was due to the little help afforded\r\nhim by the French navy. King Louis seems never to have thought of\r\nkeeping a squadron permanently on the coast of Ireland, though it would\r\nhave been easy and manifestly advantageous so to do. In the Channel,\r\nTourville had really effected very little. He is perhaps not to be\r\nblamed for retiring in August. Nobody then thought of keeping the great\r\nships out in autumn, and the French ports in the Channel are very poor.\r\nBut he had shown undeniable want of enterprise against Torrington. His\r\npursuit had been so feeble after Beachy Head that we may doubt whether\r\nhe was the man to have taken advantage of the weather-gage of the\r\nchange of wind which Herbert feared had occurred. His own countrymen\r\nwere ill-satisfied with him. The famous epigram of Seignelay that he\r\nwas _poltron de tête mais non de cœur_, is well known. If this was all\r\nthe French could do when their powers were at the best it would be the\r\nfault of the allies if they did not some day turn the tables on their\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThe operations of 1691 were of a nature to confirm this belief. A\r\npowerful fleet was sent to sea by the allies under the command of\r\nRussell. Its movements throughout the summer were wearisome and\r\nunimportant. It went to and fro between May and the beginning of\r\nautumn. In the meantime Tourville was at sea with a fleet of eighty\r\nsail of the line. His cruise is rather a famous passage in French naval\r\nhistory. He contrived to keep the sea without allowing himself to be\r\nforced to battle—and at last, by making clever use of a shift of wind,\r\nmanaged to get into Brest untouched by the allied fleet. The pride of\r\nthe French of the time with this achievement, and the satisfaction\r\nthey have expressed at it since, are the condemnation of a navy, and a\r\nmethod of conducting war. Tourville was quite strong enough to fight\r\nthe allies, yet his movements were directed to avoiding battle and to\r\ncapturing merchant ships. As a matter of fact, he missed his great\r\nprize, the Smyrna convoy, and in the meantime Limerick, King James’s\r\nlast stronghold in Ireland, was taken, and the country thoroughly\r\nsubdued. The great French fleet had preserved itself, but the King of\r\nFrance had lost an ally who kept up a useful diversion of the resources\r\nof England. A fighting force which makes it a principal object to avoid\r\nbattle is doomed to defeat when it comes across an enemy who makes it\r\na steady rule to fight. But the French never took the view that if\r\nyou wish to use the sea you must drive your enemy off it, and if you\r\nwant to do that you must smash him. In the dullest times the English\r\nnavy has always understood that the beating of the French navy was the\r\npreliminary to everything else. The French government, which was much\r\ndistressed by lack of money, was angry with Tourville for missing the\r\nconvoy, and accused him of timidity.\r\n\r\nIn 1692 the French at last learnt by a painful experience the truth\r\nof Bacon’s saying that “_Occasion turneth a bald noddle after she has\r\npresented her locks in front, and no hold taken_, or at least turneth\r\nthe handle of the bottle first to be received and afterwards the belly\r\nwhich is hard to clasp.” After wasting three years either in delivering\r\ntheir blows wide, or hitting feebly when the direction was good, the\r\nFrench at last made a serious effort to strike England to the heart.\r\nBut what they might have done with a fair prospect of success in ’89,\r\n’90, or ’91, they attempted with insufficient means in ’92. Their\r\ndeficiencies were due to causes which a little foresight would have\r\nmade them understand were sure to operate sooner or later. The events\r\nof ’90 had taught the English Government the necessity for vigorous\r\npreparations. At the same time an accident, such as was always likely\r\nto occur, prevented a timely concentration of their own forces. The\r\nToulon fleet, under Châteaurenault, ought to have joined Tourville at\r\nBrest early in the year, but it was delayed by bad weather. It was,\r\nand always has been, a cause of weakness to the French that their two\r\nseacoasts on the Mediterranean and the Atlantic are separated from one\r\nanother by the Spanish Peninsula. An enemy who is in a position to\r\noccupy the Straits of Gibraltar with a strong naval force is admirably\r\nplaced, to prevent one-half of the French fleet from uniting with\r\nthe other. Even when there was no hostile squadron in the Straits,\r\npersistent bad weather might confine the French in the Mediterranean.\r\nAt a later date, attempted concentrations of the French fleet broke\r\ndown from these very causes. But this was a probability which ought\r\nto have been provided for. Louis XIV. ought either to have made his\r\nofficers act with more spirit or not to have allowed an important part\r\nof his fleet to go back to the Mediterranean at the close of ’91. As\r\nit was, his effort to carry out a scheme of invasion with a part of\r\nhis naval force, when the whole of them would not have been too many,\r\nended, as it was bound to end, in disastrous failure.\r\n\r\nThe allied Dutch and English fleets were out early. Their Governments\r\nhad a double motive for wasting no time. They were aware that an army\r\nof invasion, consisting in part of Irish regiments in the service of\r\nFrance, was being collected in Normandy for the invasion of England. In\r\nspite of many disappointments King James was still hopeful, and he had\r\npersuaded the King of France to make an effort to help the Jacobites\r\nin England. The army of invasion, some 30,000 strong, was collected in\r\nthe Côtentin. They were quartered at La Hougue, on the eastern side of\r\nthe Côtentin. Another object for which the allies had to provide was\r\nthe safe return of the ships, Dutch and English, composing the Smyrna\r\nconvoy. It was coming home under the protection of a squadron commanded\r\nby Sir Ralph Delaval. In order to discharge the double duty of covering\r\nthe return of the convoy and watching the French, a detached squadron\r\nunder the command of Rear-Admiral Carter cruised on the coast from\r\nBrest to Cape La Hague, the north-westerly point of the Côtentin.\r\nDelaval brought his convoy back in March and then joined Carter on the\r\ncoast of France. In later times the English navy would have prepared to\r\nprevent the concentration of the French fleet by cruising off Brest,\r\nbut at the end of the seventeenth century our officers had not yet\r\nacquired that confidence in their vessels, and the vessels had not been\r\nso far perfected, as to make cruising in spring on so dangerous a coast\r\nas that about Brest appear practicable for the great ships. The grand\r\nfleet was not in fact fully ready for sea till May, when Russell called\r\nin the detached squadrons, and united his whole force at St. Helens.\r\n\r\nThere was another reason for bringing the fleet together. The\r\nGovernment had decided on making a demonstration. During the last few\r\nmonths, as indeed at all times in King William’s reign, the Jacobite\r\nagents had been very busy. The great discontent undoubtedly existing\r\namong the naval officers, and partly due to the grievances as to\r\ntheir pay, had appeared to give the friends of the exiled king an\r\nopportunity. Captain David Lloyd had been running to and fro with great\r\nzeal. His old comrades were too much attached to him to betray him\r\nto the Government even when they were opposed to his party, and there\r\nwere no doubt great numbers of English naval officers who were as well\r\ndisposed as other Englishmen to restore the exiled king if only he\r\nwould not be his own worst enemy. These men would not be shocked by\r\narguments in his favour. As they had themselves been praised and in\r\nsome cases rewarded for deserting King James, it would be unreasonable\r\nto expect that they should have been greatly offended when asked by\r\nan old brother officer to desert back to him from King William. The\r\nactivity of Lloyd was perfectly well known to the English Government.\r\nHe had spoken to Carter, who had immediately reported the whole of the\r\nconversation to the queen. Lloyd himself does not appear to have taken\r\nall the grumblings he heard among his brother seamen very seriously,\r\nand the Council of Regency was probably not very frightened. But it\r\nwisely decided to bring all doubts to the test. On the 15th May a\r\nletter drawn up in the queen’s name by the Secretary, Nottingham, was\r\nsent down to the flag officers and captains of the fleet. In this\r\nletter the queen informed them that she had heard stories accusing them\r\nof disloyalty but she did not believe the accusations, and continued to\r\nrepose the most complete confidence in their fidelity. This profession\r\nof a confidence it would have been wise to assume, even if it had\r\nnot been sincerely felt, was at once communicated by Russell to his\r\nsubordinates. It had the effect which had been hoped for. The fleet\r\nanswered by unanimous expression of loyalty. An address expressing the\r\nperfect readiness of all the officers to venture their lives, with all\r\nimaginable “alacrity and resolution,” in defence “of the Government\r\nand of the religion and liberty of the country and against all Popish\r\ninvaders whatsoever,” was drawn up and signed on behalf of the fleet by\r\nsixty-four flag officers and captains.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity was speedily given to these officers to show that they\r\ncould be as good as their word. A council of war decided to take the\r\ninitiative against the French. A body of troops was to be landed at St.\r\nMalo, while the allied fleet was to lie to the westward of that place\r\nin order to provoke a battle. On the 18th May, Russell sailed from St.\r\nHelens, and on the following day when he was about twenty miles off\r\nCape Barfleur, the easterly corner of the Côtentin, the look-out ships\r\nto the westward of the fleet made the signal for seeing the enemy. In\r\nfact, while the allies had been talking of invading France, Tourville\r\nhad sailed from Brest with the intention of covering an invasion of\r\nEngland, and after suffering some delay from the weather had come so\r\nfar. The two fleets now opposed to one another were divided as follows,\r\nand consisted of the elements shown on these lists:—\r\n\r\n

than twice as strong as their enemy.\r\nIf this was a surprise to the French, the information supplied to\r\nLouis XIV. by the Jacobites in England, and by his agents in the Low\r\nCountries, must have been far less accurate than is commonly supposed.\r\nIf, on the other hand, he really did believe that the grumblers in\r\nthe English fleet, and that Russell the admiral, who was undoubtedly\r\nin communication with the exiled court at St. Germain, would betray\r\ntheir country to its hereditary enemy on the field of battle, and under\r\nthe eyes of all the world, he must have been singularly impervious\r\nto experience. Tourville received peremptory orders, dated the 26th\r\nMarch, and worded in a style insulting to him. He was told to go near\r\nenough to the enemy to see them for himself, and not to be misled into\r\nbelieving that merchant-ships were men-of-war, as he was accused of\r\ndoing during the off-shore cruise of 1691. If on reaching La Hougue\r\nhe found the allies already there, he was to attack them whatever\r\ntheir numbers might be. If victorious, he was to cover the passage of\r\nthe army to England. If defeated, he was to save his fleet as he best\r\ncould. Should the allies not be near La Hougue when he arrived, he was\r\nto transport the army without waste of time. If the allies attacked him\r\nduring the passage, he was to fight with obstinacy, so as to give the\r\narmy time to land. In case the allies appeared after the landing, he\r\nmight avoid a battle if they exceeded in number by ten ships.\r\n\r\nWhen the French were signalled by the guns of the look-out ships at\r\nthree o’clock on the morning of the 19th, the weather was foggy.\r\nFearing that the enemy might stretch past him to northward, Russell\r\nsignalled to the rear to tack and close the space between him and\r\nthe coast of England. At four o’clock the mist lifted and the enemy\r\nwere seen to the westward with their heads pointing to the south. As\r\nthis showed that they had no intention of attempting to turn him on\r\nthe north side Russell countermanded the order to the Rear or Blue\r\nDivision. The allied fleet was not in order of battle but scattered\r\nsome ahead, some to windward, and some to leeward of the admiral.\r\nThe wind was blowing from the S.W., and the French therefore had the\r\nweather-gage. The line was formed at eight o’clock with the Dutch\r\nor White Squadron in the van, and to the south of the Red Squadron\r\nwhich formed the centre, then came the Blue Squadron farthest to the\r\nnorth. There must have been a distance of many miles between the first\r\nand last ship of this great fleet of ninety-nine sail, and the Blue\r\nSquadron was still to leeward. Having made his simple disposition to\r\nmeet the attack Russell lay with his topsail to the mast waiting for\r\nthe enemy to come on. With a resolution of character which shows his\r\ninnate superiority to Herbert, Tourville charged home. He directed his\r\nattack on the centre of the allied line, telling off a few ships in his\r\nvan and rear to watch the van and rear of the allies, and prevent them\r\nfrom doubling on his own fleet.\r\n\r\nThe battle began about ten o’clock, and lasted till about five in the\r\nafternoon. The French ships engaged with the Red Division made no\r\nattempt to break through the English line. The battle was conducted\r\nentirely by cannonading at short ranges, and the English claimed that\r\ntheir fire was more rapid than the French. When the enemy’s attack was\r\nfully developed Russell ordered the van to tack for the purpose of\r\ngetting to windward of the French, and putting them between two fires,\r\nand at the same time signalled to the Blue Division to come closer to\r\nthe centre. Neither order could be obeyed, for the wind was very light\r\nso that the ships were unable to manœuvre. The real battle was always\r\nbetween the Red Squadron and the ships immediately around Tourville.\r\nAbout two o’clock in the afternoon the wind, after falling altogether,\r\nrose again, but from the N.W., thus giving the weather-gage to the\r\nallies, and by five o’clock Tourville began to draw off. He doubtless\r\nfelt that enough had been done for honour, and he hoped that the Red\r\nSquadron had been sufficiently mauled to cripple it from pursuing him.\r\nThe wind was light and variable. As the French ships drew away to the\r\nwestward it fell calm and the mist arose again; then there was a short\r\nsquall from the east. Sir Cloudesley Shovell with the rear division of\r\nthe Red Squadron broke through the French in the interval between the\r\ncentre and the ships which had been stretched out to observe the rear\r\nof the allies. Captain Hastings of the =Sandwich= was killed at this\r\nphase of the action. The two fleets became mingled in the fog, and\r\ndrifted to the westward with the ebb-tide. Both anchored at the flood,\r\nbut at this moment a portion of the Blue Squadron which had worked to\r\nthe westward of the French drifted back through them in the mist and\r\ndarkness. They were fired on as they came through, and Rear-Admiral\r\nCarter, whose division made this movement, was killed. The sound of the\r\ncannonading was heard by the rest of the allied fleet, but it could\r\ntake no part in the action. When he saw that the enemy was in retreat\r\nRussell had ordered a general chase, that is to say he left each ship\r\nfree to go at its utmost speed. But no great rapidity of movement was\r\npossible. The wind had fallen, and the fog made it impossible to see.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of what strictly speaking is called the battle of\r\nLa Hogue, from the old spelling of La Hougue. The name is improperly\r\nused, for the actual battle was fought off Cape Barfleur. The battle of\r\nBarfleur was in fact the title commonly given by our ancestors, but it\r\nhas been displaced by the name of the place which was the last scene\r\nof the four days’ pursuit following on the action. The pursuit began\r\nlike a nightmare, in strenuous effort to act without the power to move.\r\nBoth fleets had anchored during the night. When daylight came there\r\nwas a thick haze and the French were invisible to the allied fleet.\r\nWhat little wind there was, was from the N.N.E. At about eight o’clock\r\nsome of the Dutch ships caught sight of the enemy to the W.S.W. The\r\npursuit was resumed, but, as the ships could not move more quickly\r\nthan they were carried by the tide, the progress was very slow. At four\r\no’clock in the afternoon the ebb-tide ceased, and both fleets again\r\nanchored, the French in order to avoid the risk of being carried among\r\ntheir pursuers, and the allies so that they should not lose ground.\r\nThey had moved so little during the ebb-tide that they were still off\r\nCape Barfleur, and at no great distance from the scene of the battle.\r\nAs long as the tide was flowing it was useless to move, but at ten\r\nin the evening, when it turned, both fleets again got under way and\r\nbegan to drift to the west. About this time the fore-topmast of the\r\n=Britannia=, which had been seriously injured in the action, came\r\ndown, and as Russell did not transfer his flag to another vessel, this\r\ndelayed the Red Squadron under his immediate command. Many of them must\r\nhave suffered in the action. Whether because they felt bound to remain\r\nabout their admiral, or because they could not move any faster, the\r\nships of the Red Squadron fell somewhat behind in the pursuit while\r\nthe Blue and White pressed on ahead. At four in the morning of the\r\n21st both fleets anchored again. They had now tided so far that they\r\nwere almost off Cape La Hague. Both were much scattered. A part of the\r\nFrench had passed the Cape, the others had not. Among those which had\r\nfailed to get beyond the headland was the _Soleil Royal_, Tourville’s\r\nflagship. She had suffered very severely in the action from the fire of\r\nthe =Britannia= and the ships just ahead and astern. It has been said\r\nwith some appearance of truth that if Tourville had had the resolution\r\nto set her on fire he might have brought the whole of his fleet round\r\nCape La Hague. But she was the pride of the French Navy, and had been\r\nnamed from the king himself who was the royal sun of France, and the\r\nadmiral could not make his mind up to sacrifice her. He had, however,\r\ntransferred his flag to another ship the _Ambitieux_.\r\n\r\nWhen the fleets were ordered to anchor, only a portion of the French\r\nwas able to obey. Whether it was because they had slipped their cables\r\non the previous night, and therefore could not anchor, or whether\r\ntheir anchors would not hold, it is certain that they were unable to\r\nstop themselves from being carried to the eastward towards the allies.\r\nThe position then in the early hours of the 21st was this, one part\r\nof the French fleet was ahead, to the west another part was drifting\r\neastward between the land and the allies. The best sailing ships of\r\nthe White and Blue Squadrons were well ahead of Russell, who with the\r\nRed Squadron was furthest of all to the east. The inability of the\r\nships immediately about him to anchor showed Tourville that it was\r\nuseless to endeavour to keep his now divided fleet acting as one body\r\nany longer. If he summoned the ships to the west to his assistance he\r\nwould bring the whole fleet into a trap between the land and the enemy,\r\nwho was in overwhelming numbers. Since he could no longer exercise his\r\npowers as commander to any advantage there remained nothing for him\r\nbut to abdicate. He therefore hauled down his flag of command from\r\nthe main-topmast-head, as a signal that every captain was free to act\r\nas he thought best for the safety of his ship. The French fleet now\r\nsplit into fragments. One part, under the Chef d’escadre Pannetier\r\nmade a push for the Channel between the coast of France and the island\r\nof Alderney. The easterly current of the flood-tide splits at Cape La\r\nHague. While the main body flows up Channel a branch turns off, and\r\nruns with great speed between the west side of the Côtentin and the\r\nisland of Alderney. This makes what we call the Race of Alderney, and\r\nthe French the Raz Blanchard. The navigation is dangerous, and would,\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, have been avoided by the heavy ships,\r\nbut circumstances only left the French a choice of evils, and they ran\r\nthrough the Race to seek refuge under the guns of St. Malo.\r\n\r\nRussell, seeing that the division of the French and the distress of the\r\nvessels drifting towards him made it no longer necessary to keep his\r\nfleet together, signalled to Ashby, and the Dutch to pursue Pannetier.\r\nMeanwhile he, with the Red Division and the laggards of the White and\r\nBlue, prepared to deal with those of Tourville’s ships which had failed\r\nto round La Hague. Ashby could not reach the enemy. Pannetier had time\r\nto get his ships over the bar of the Rance, and take refuge under the\r\nguns of the corsair town of St. Malo, before his pursuers reached him.\r\nAshby returned next day and joined Sir Ralph Delaval, who, in the\r\nmeantime, had done a good stroke of work at Cherbourg. When it became\r\nclear that they were trapped the ships of Tourville had no resource\r\nbut to endeavour to fly to the eastward between Russell and the land,\r\nto round Cape Barfleur and to take refuge at La Hougue. Three of them\r\nwere too crippled for further flight. These were the famous _Soleil\r\nRoyal_, for whose sake so much had been risked, the _Admirable_, and\r\nthe _Triomphant_. All three were run ashore at Cherbourg, and the\r\nothers fled eastward. Russell left Sir Ralph Delaval to deal with the\r\nstranded ships, and followed the rest. Delaval could do nothing on the\r\nevening of the 21st, but on the following morning he sent in the boats\r\nand fireships, under the command of Captain Heath, Captain Greenaway,\r\nand Captain Foulis. The _Admirable_ and _Triomphant_ were burnt. But\r\nthe fireship with which Captain Foulis endeavoured to burn the _Soleil\r\nRoyal_ was sunk by the Frenchmen’s fire. Hereupon, Delaval hauled in as\r\nclose as he could and opened fire on the great stranded flagship. When\r\nhe had battered her for some time, and found that no further resistance\r\nwas made, he took his boats and boarded her. Sir Ralph Delaval’s\r\nreport contains a detail which is discreditable to King Louis’s navy.\r\nHe says he found many men and wounded men in the _Soleil Royal_, but\r\nno officers. She was burnt by the English. When the work was done Sir\r\nRalph was disturbed by thirty sail approaching him from the west.\r\nThis, however, turned out to be Sir John Ashby’s squadron, and the two\r\nofficers united their forces, and followed the admiral to the east. A\r\nfew of the French ships under command of Nesmond escaped by sailing\r\nround the British Isles.\r\n\r\nRussell pursued Tourville round Cape Barfleur. The French admiral ran\r\nas close as he could to La Hougue, with the thirteen vessels still\r\nabout him. It was not until the evening of the 22nd, so light was the\r\nwind and so slow were the ships of that time amid tides and variable\r\nbreezes, that Russell was able to anchor in the neighbourhood of the\r\nfugitives. On the 23rd he sent in the boats and fireships under Rooke,\r\nwho burnt six of the enemy. On the 24th the work was completed by the\r\ndestruction of the other seven. The French indeed were panic-stricken,\r\nand the resistance was trifling. Not more than ten men were killed\r\nin this piece of service, which if attempted against an alert and\r\nresolute enemy must needs have been very costly.\r\n\r\nThe battle pursuit and destruction spread over these five days, and\r\nincluded under the name of “La Hogue” make nearly the last passage of\r\nnaval warfare of a brilliant decisive character which we shall meet\r\nfor three-quarters of a century. The navy had work of vital importance\r\nto do, and a function of unusual importance to fulfil. But it was no\r\nlonger to meet equal fleets at sea, except on rare occasions, and\r\nwhen it did its own method of fighting was dull. The French fleet\r\nvery soon ceased to contend with the allies in the ocean and channel\r\naltogether, and in the Mediterranean its efforts were spasmodic. The\r\ngreat change has been attributed to the disaster of La Hogue, without\r\nsufficient reason. We have seen that the operations of the French in\r\nprevious years had been very languid. Their weakness during the rest\r\nof the war was to be mainly attributed to the French king’s want of\r\nmoney. His resources were overburdened by the war on land against the\r\nLeague of Augsburg, and he could not afford to fit out great fleets.\r\nBut to our ancestors the importance of the battle of La Hogue was\r\nnaturally a subject of high gratification. The material loss inflicted\r\non King Louis was considerable, and the blow to his prestige greater\r\nstill. They could feel that the Channel was now safe, not indeed from\r\nprivateers, but from great fleets sent out to cover an invasion of\r\nEngland. Besides, after the spiritless straggling operations of the\r\nlast three years, the resolution of Russell and the vigour of his\r\npursuit were an immense change for the better.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the French navy was not immediately visible. An attempt\r\nto attack St. Malo at the close of 1692 was given up as hopeless, and\r\nthe ships under Pannetier’s command were able to make their way to\r\nBrest undisturbed. In 1693 the French even achieved a considerable\r\nmeasure of success, partly through their own good management, and\r\npartly by the help of mistakes of the English Government. Russell\r\nwas no longer at sea. The shifting politics of the time, and his own\r\nposition as one of the leaders of the Whig party, combined with the\r\nking’s discovery of his intrigues with St. Germain to remove him from\r\ncommand. His place was taken by Killigrew, Delaval, and Shovell, who\r\nwere combined in a joint commission as admiral. The practice of giving\r\nthe command at sea to a committee was once more revived because the\r\nGovernment distrusted a single command. The result was to discredit for\r\never the appointment of several men to do work which most especially\r\nrequires unity of will and authority.\r\n\r\nThe fleet was collected under the joint admirals in April. It was not\r\nmanned without great difficulty. Crews had to be found by taking men\r\nout of the privateers and by embarking five regiments of soldiers to\r\nserve as marines. Neither the Government nor the admirals had any\r\ndefinite plan of operations for the year. But an object was found for\r\nthem by the necessity of escorting the Mediterranean trade safe on its\r\nway. The French privateers had been very active, and the convoy work\r\nat least of the English navy very badly done. Ships had remained in\r\nport rather than face the risk of making a passage. The necessities\r\nof the English and Dutch revenue compelled the Government to forward\r\nthe trade, and so a squadron was told off under the command of Rooke\r\nand the Dutch admiral Van der Goes, to carry the outward-bound Smyrna\r\nconvoy into the Mediterranean. The twenty-three ships, Dutch and\r\nEnglish, appointed to protect the convoy would have been insufficient\r\nto deal with the Brest fleet, and the admirals were therefore ordered\r\nto see Rooke and his Dutch colleague well past Ushant. In the latter\r\ndays of May the whole force was collected and sailed with the merchant\r\nship under its protection in the beginning of June. By an oversight,\r\nwhich reflects very little credit on their intelligence, the admirals\r\nomitted to find out whether the French were in Brest or not. They had\r\nbeen ordered to accompany the convoy thirty leagues past Ushant, and\r\nthey reached that point on the 4th of June. Not being satisfied that\r\nenough had been done for safety they exceeded their instructions so far\r\nas to continue with the merchant ships till they were fifty leagues\r\nW.S.W. off the island of Ushant. Then they left them and returned to\r\nthe Channel. It is an example of the vices still prevailing in our\r\nnaval administration that though the fleet had only just been collected\r\nit was in want of provisions already. When the admirals had returned to\r\nTorbay they learnt what they ought to have been at the trouble to find\r\nout before, namely, that Tourville had left Brest. At the same time\r\nthe English Consul at Leghorn forwarded information that the French\r\nToulon fleet was ready to sail from Toulon. This report did not reach\r\nthe admirals till the 13th June. When it was too late they realised the\r\nextent of the danger threatening Rooke. Tourville had in fact sailed\r\nsouth in May with orders to wait for the convoy. Messages were sent in\r\nhot haste to warn Rooke of his danger, but the disaster had happened\r\nbefore they could reach him.\r\n\r\nWhile the admirals and Government were realising their mistake and\r\nwere looking forward to the inevitable outcry in the City and House\r\nof Commons, the great convoy had been rolling southward at a speed\r\nregulated by the slowest of the merchant ships, happy if it made three\r\nmiles an hour in favourable circumstances. It reached Cape St. Vincent\r\non the 17th June. Here Rooke despatched a look-out vessel ahead, to see\r\nif there were any enemies in Lagos Bay, on the south coast of Portugal\r\nbetween Cape St. Vincent and Faro. The wind was very light, and the\r\nconvoy made little progress. Next day the frigates discovered ten sail\r\nof French ships standing out of Lagos. The position was an extremely\r\ndifficult one. With a large force of men-of-war so close at hand there\r\nwas little hope of safety in flight for heavily laden merchant ships.\r\nIt was decided to make a push for the friendly Spanish port of Cadiz.\r\nThe wind from the N.N.W. was still light, and it might be that the\r\nFrench being to leeward would be unable to work up. But this course,\r\nthough perhaps the best, where all were bad, led the convoy right into\r\nthe jaws of Tourville’s fleet of eighty-six sail. Battle was hopeless,\r\nand flight not much better. Yet to run was all there was to do. The\r\nFrench advanced squadron had fallen back merely to draw the convoy on,\r\nand even if the bait had not succeeded there could have been but one\r\nend to the meeting. A hurry and a scurry such as may easily be imagined\r\nfollowed. Some of the small ships ran close in shore, by Rooke’s\r\norders, and endeavoured to find a refuge in Faro, San Lucar, or Cadiz.\r\nBy these we must understand very small craft from 40 to 100 tons. The\r\nheavier ships, meaning boats from 150 to 300 tons, the size of a large\r\nmerchant ship of those times, did their best to shelter themselves\r\nbehind Rooke and Van der Goes, and they all struggled to get away into\r\nthe open sea. The Dutch warships were in more danger than our own, for\r\nbeing in the van they were to leeward and nearer the French. Tourville\r\nmust have suffered from a constitutional inability to act with energy\r\nexcept by fits and starts. He now repeated, and with even less excuse,\r\nthe very mistake he made after the battle of Beachy Head. His pursuit\r\nwas slack. Some of the Dutch ships were overtaken and captured after\r\na gallant resistance. But Rooke was able to carry a great part of the\r\nconvoy to Madeira, and from thence home to Cork. He joined the admiral\r\nin the Channel in August. Tourville, after giving up the pursuit of\r\nRooke too early, returned to the Straits where he spent his time in\r\ncapturing or destroying the smaller merchant vessels. The total loss\r\nto the Dutch and English was put down at twenty-nine vessels taken and\r\nfifty destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis business of the Smyrna convoy may be said to be the turning-point\r\nof the war. Louis XIV. had sent Tourville to capture the Smyrna convoy\r\nmainly because he looked to gain money. In the following year he\r\nordered the Brest fleet into the Mediterranean, and he made no serious\r\nattempt to contend with the allies in the western seas during the\r\nremainder of the war. At the time, and while the smart of the loss was\r\nfresh in England and Holland, this could not be known. The capture of\r\nthe convoy led to a furious outcry against the Admiralty in England,\r\nand to violent inconclusive discussions in Parliament. Yet it was the\r\ndirect cause of a great change for the better. The Government was\r\nfully waked up to the necessity of taking its fleet more seriously\r\nin hand. The effort to conduct a war by a committee was given up.\r\nRussell was restored to the command. At the same time, the officers\r\nwere stimulated to do their work with a better heart by increase of pay\r\nand the establishment of the half-pay list. With sinking energy on the\r\nside of the French and increasing efficiency on our own the naval war\r\ntook a new character. From this time forward there was an overwhelming\r\nsuperiority on the side of the allies. England came to contribute an\r\nincreasing proportion of the naval force employed, for the land war\r\nwas straining Holland to the utmost. When the struggle with Louis\r\nXIV. came to an end at the Peace of Utrecht, England was much the one\r\nunrivalled sea power as she was when Napoleon surrendered to Captain\r\nMaitland of the =Bellerophon=.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEXPEDITIONS, CONVOY, AND THE PRIVATEERS\r\n\r\n AUTHORITIES.—See last Chapter; _Memoirs of Forbin and Duguay-Trouin_;\r\n     Poulain, _La Course au 17^{me} Siècle_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second and larger division of the War of the League of Augsburg\r\ncan be most conveniently dealt with by subjects rather than in\r\nchronological order. There were no great campaigns between equal forces\r\nof sufficient interest to be taken by themselves. Throughout all these\r\nyears the overpowering fleets of the Alliance cruised unchecked on the\r\nsea, hemming France in, harassing her coast, annihilating her commerce,\r\nand rendering assistance to the armies operating against her. Detached\r\nsquadrons issued from England year after year to attack the French\r\npossessions in the New World and defend our own. In the meantime, the\r\nefforts of France on the sea were ever more strictly confined to the\r\ncruises of her privateers.\r\n\r\nThe object before the allies when once they had vindicated their\r\nsuperiority on the ocean was to harass the French coast and to\r\nco-operate with the armies on shore wherever an opportunity presented\r\nitself. The first duty was done with more barbarism than success. In\r\nthe November of 1693 a futile attack was made on St. Malo by Benbow.\r\nInfernal machines, invented by one Meesters, a Dutchman in the English\r\nservice, were drifted in for the purpose of destroying the shipping.\r\nThey exploded too soon, and did no harm to the enemy. This attack on\r\nSt. Malo was both the beginning and the type of a kind of operation we\r\nadhered to till the middle of the eighteenth century. Good powder and\r\nshot, and the lives of men, were thrown away in one dab after another\r\nat this or the other point on the French coast. It was very rarely that\r\nthe expedition succeeded in causing any serious destruction to the\r\nenemy. When it did, the harm inflicted on France was never enough to\r\ncripple her power, though the suffering caused to individuals was no\r\ndoubt cruel. The English Government hardly ever showed itself capable\r\nof understanding that to assail unfortified towns does no good, and\r\nthat fortified towns must be attacked with sufficient resources. To\r\ngive more than a mere mention to such enterprises as these here would\r\nbe to overestimate their importance altogether.\r\n\r\nIn 1694 this work of harassing the French was taken in hand, with\r\nresults excellently calculated to show how a fleet ought to act, and\r\nhow it ought not. Russell was at sea at a reasonably early date, with\r\nthe intention to watch the Brest fleet and to endeavour to destroy that\r\nport itself. If the French fleet remained in the harbour the whole of\r\nhis force would be needed for the purpose. If, however, Tourville had\r\ngone south a detachment might be left to deal with Brest, and Russell\r\ncould go on. This recognition of the fact that the proper employment\r\nof an English fleet was to follow the enemy was perfectly sound in\r\nprinciple. So much cannot be said for the plan of attack on Brest.\r\nIt might be a very advantageous thing to destroy the great French\r\narsenal, but such a place was certain to be so strongly fortified as\r\nto be impregnable to the sudden attack of a mere flying column. Yet\r\nno greater force than can be fairly described by the name was put\r\nunder the command of Tollemache. As a matter of fact the expedition\r\nwas hopeless, for it had been betrayed to King Louis by some of King\r\nWilliam’s servants who were in communication with St. Germain. One of\r\nthe traitors was the great Marlborough.\r\n\r\nAs early as the 19th May, Russell learnt that Tourville had already\r\nsailed for the south. Before starting in pursuit, the new Admiral\r\nof the Fleet was able to deliver one effectual stroke at the enemy.\r\nA large French convoy of merchant ships was lying in Berteaume Bay\r\nunder the protection of one French man-of-war. Russell dispatched a\r\nlight squadron under Captain Pritchard to destroy it. The work was\r\nthoroughly done, and was followed up by the destruction of a number of\r\nother vessels going south with provisions to Tourville. Then, on the\r\n5th or 6th June, Russell sailed for the south, leaving Lord Berkeley\r\nto carry out the attack on Brest. On the 7th of June Berkeley entered\r\nthe wide channel between the Pointe St. Mathieu and the Pointe du Raz,\r\ncalled the Iroise. The entrance to the Bay of Brest, named Le Goulet,\r\nor Gullet, is on the north-east corner of this channel. It is a narrow\r\npassage which leads into the land-locked Bay of Brest. The bay is shut\r\noff from the sea by a peninsula running south from the Goulet. The\r\nwestern side of this peninsula, after running due north and south,\r\nturns to the west with a curve to the end at the north, and forms the\r\nanchorage known as the Roads or Bay of Camaret.\r\n\r\nThe object of the expedition was to land in Camaret Bay, seize the\r\npeninsula on the western side of the harbour, and, using that as a\r\nbasis of operations, open the entry to the bay to the fleet; and then\r\ndestroy the arsenal of Brest. The French were on their guard; Camaret\r\nBay was bristling with batteries and lined with troops. To go on was an\r\nact of folly, and so Carmarthen, who surveyed the bay, gave Tollemache\r\nto understand; but the soldier, though an exceedingly brave man and a\r\ngood subordinate, was no general, and he was burning to distinguish\r\nhimself. He urged the naval officers on, and among them he found an\r\nally in Lord Berkeley. The result was that several ships were all but\r\nbattered to pieces by the French cannon, and Tollemache landed at the\r\nsouthern corner of the bay with a few hundred men—an act of headlong\r\nfolly which cost him his life, and sacrificed the lives of many others.\r\nThen the expedition came away.\r\n\r\nThere was a kind of wrong-headed magnanimity about the conduct of\r\nTollemache which extorts a certain respect, but the succeeding\r\noperations are merely examples of how to combine the greatest possible\r\nmalignity of intention with a high degree of ineptitude in the\r\nexecution. Berkeley came back to St. Helens for refreshments, and\r\nthen returned to the coast of France to take revenge. What he did was\r\nmorally on a level with the desolation of the Palatinate, for which\r\nKing Louis had been so bitterly reproached by his enemies, and it\r\nhad this further disgrace attaching to it, that it was imbecile. The\r\nEnglish fleet only bombarded Dieppe and Havre, killing a certain number\r\nof women, children, and unarmed men, and burning a few houses. Then\r\nit threatened La Hogue and Cherbourg. This done, it came back to St.\r\nHelens for refreshments. When invigorated by repose it returned to\r\nDunkirk, and exploded more infernal machines to no purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1695 it was the same story. We made a demonstration at St. Malo,\r\nthen we burnt the little fishing town of Granvelle, and then we\r\nachieved another failure at Dunkirk. In the following year these feats\r\nwere renewed at Calais and elsewhere, till the war died down and was\r\nbrought to a pause by the truce called the Peace of Ryswick in 1697.\r\nWhen it was resumed, the Admiralty had learnt that these expeditions\r\nwere forms of waste, and we hear little or nothing of them during the\r\nreign of Queen Anne. It is probable that Captain Pritchard did more\r\nharm to the enemy by destroying the convoy in Berteaume Bay than was\r\ninflicted in all these expeditions, and he did it at a thousandth part\r\nof the cost.\r\n\r\nMore legitimate and fruitful than these attacks on the French coast\r\ntowns were other operations of the fleet, which may be classed under\r\ntwo heads. First are the cruises of what our ancestors called “The\r\nGrand Fleet”—that is to say, movements of great forces representing the\r\nbulk of our effective naval power in Europe. Then contemporary to, but\r\napart from them, were the cruises of squadrons, designed to protect our\r\nown colonial possessions or menace those of the French. These two kinds\r\nof naval operations were so far independent of one another that it is\r\nnot necessary to tell them together. Again, many of them were so barren\r\nin results that it is superfluous to tell them in detail. Yet the mere\r\nfact that they took place shows the magnitude, the persistence, and\r\nthe coherence of our efforts to make full use of the fleet. It has\r\nseemed to me most advisable to set them both forth briefly in parallel\r\ncolumns, and give particular accounts of the more notable among them\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n          Grand Fleets                            Small Squadrons\r\n\r\n The year of Beachy Head.

They do not include minor\r\noperations against the French coast in the Channel, nor do they mention\r\nall the subordinate parts of the colonial expeditions. It is also\r\nnecessary to bear in mind that the Grand Fleets were the fleets of the\r\nallies, not of England alone. The Dutch always contributed a part of\r\nthe strength, and their share of the common force was nowise inferior\r\nin spirit, or skill, to ours. In one of the elements which go to make\r\nefficiency they were not rarely superior. Their health was too often\r\nbetter, since, to the deep discredit of British administrations of that\r\ntime, we did not on the average feed our men as well as the Dutch. The\r\ncolonial expeditions were our own, and the work was done at an awful\r\ncost of life by disease.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the cruises of the allied Grand Fleets could\r\nonly be the successive exercises of an overwhelming superiority,\r\ndirected against an enemy whose resistance must needs be passive, with\r\nrare and fitful efforts at retaliation. Year after year the great\r\ncombined naval armaments of England and Holland sailed south in the\r\nspring. Before the Peace of Ryswick (1697) they went once to aid the\r\nSpaniards, who were contending feebly against the French in Catalonia.\r\nAfter the renewal of the war, they went repeatedly to aid the Hapsburg\r\npretender, who was endeavouring to drive the Bourbon King of Spain,\r\nPhilip V., from the throne he occupied by right of inheritance and\r\nthe will of Charles II., the last of the Austrian dynasty. They\r\nalso served to cover the movements of English and Dutch commerce by\r\nmewing up the only fleet which Louis XIV. endeavoured to maintain in\r\nToulon. Incidentally they enabled us to secure what Cromwell had hoped\r\nfor, and what our Charles II. endeavoured to obtain by his marriage\r\ntreaty—namely, a port of war near the Mediterranean, where an English\r\nfleet could keep its stores, repair damages, and find a safe anchorage\r\nwithout being dependent on the goodwill of an ally.\r\n\r\nThe interest of a conflict between strength and weakness cannot be\r\nin proportion to the importance of its results. These campaigns must\r\ntherefore (considerations of space being also of much weight) “speak by\r\ntheir foreman”; by the typical examples. None seem more representative\r\nthan the first great cruise into the Mediterranean in 1694, and that\r\nexpedition of ten years later which put us in possession of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nIt has been said above that the Grand Fleet had gone to sea in the\r\nspring of 1694 under the command of Russell. He was also the chief of\r\nthe “commission for executing the office of Lord High Admiral”—and\r\ntherefore combined the whole civil and military authority in his own\r\nperson. The fleet consisted of fifty-two English and forty-one Dutch\r\nships of the line, with their attendant fireships and small craft, when\r\nall were collected at St. Helens. When he was sure that the French had\r\nno fleet in Brest to assist in the defence, the admiral returned to St.\r\nHelens on the 23rd May, and sailed with his whole force on the 29th.\r\nOn the 6th June the force designed to carry out the already mentioned\r\nraid on Brest was detached, and Russell sailed for the south in pursuit\r\nof the French with thirty English and twenty-two Dutch. He was off the\r\nRock of Lisbon on the 25th June. Here he was reinforced by ships both\r\nEnglish and Dutch, and his force was raised to sixty-three. A little\r\nlater he was burdened by the co-operation of nine very inefficient\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nIn July Russell entered the Mediterranean, to the great relief of\r\nthe palsied Spanish Government, now trembling in impotence before\r\nthe French army of invasion in Catalonia and the French fleet in the\r\nMediterranean. The enemy retired as the allies worked their way slowly\r\nup the coast and finally took refuge in the roadstead of Hyères, to\r\nthe east of Toulon. Russell and his Dutch colleagues were then able to\r\ncover the Spanish forces in Catalonia and the Spanish coast trade from\r\nFrench attack. As autumn approached, they prepared to return; but King\r\nWilliam wisely came to the decision that there was no better way of\r\nprotecting English and Dutch naval interests at home than by keeping\r\nthe French fleet shut in the Mediterranean. Russell therefore received\r\norders to winter in Cadiz. He had to struggle with the unreasonable\r\nrequests of the Spanish Government, which expected its allies to do\r\neverything for it, and could itself do little or nothing. Yet, as they\r\nwere well supplied with money, stores, and even artificers from home,\r\nthe allies passed the winter abroad at no greater cost than would have\r\nbeen incurred in their own ports.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1695, English troops were sent out under Brigadier\r\nStewart, and a Dutch contingent under the Count of Nassau. The allies,\r\nafter delays attributed to the dilatory preparations of the Spaniards,\r\nmoved up the coast, and reached Barcelona on the 19th July. Stimulated\r\nby Russell, the Spanish viceroy of Catalonia resolved to take the\r\noffensive against the French, who were in possession of the northern\r\npart of the principality. It was decided to besiege Palamos, a coast\r\ntown just south of Cape San Sebastian. English and Dutch soldiers\r\nwere landed to aid the Spaniards, who for their part signally failed\r\nto keep the promises they had made to supply tents and tools for work\r\nin the trenches. Yet the siege, which began on the 9th of August, was\r\nmaking fair progress, when it was suddenly broken up by the decision\r\nof Russell himself. The Duke of Vendôme, who commanded the French army\r\nin Catalonia, put false information in his way, to the effect that a\r\nFrench fleet of sixty-five sail was fitting for sea at Toulon. Hereupon\r\nRussell re-embarked his soldiers, advised the Spanish viceroy to\r\nrenounce all hope of retaking Palamos, and sailed to find the French.\r\nThis measure has been praised, in view of the danger that the fleet\r\nfrom Toulon might have interfered with the siege. Yet if Russell was\r\nconfident of his capacity to meet King Louis’s ships in battle—and\r\nif he was not it was a gross blunder to form the siege at all, and\r\nanother to sail for the purpose of meeting a superior fleet—he had it\r\nin his power to force on an action by pressing the attack, and waiting\r\ntill the enemy came to interrupt him. By sailing in response to a mere\r\nrumour, he enabled the French to effect their purpose of raising the\r\nsiege at no cost. Moreover, he did not secure the battle he sought.\r\nThe French having nothing to gain by an action, did not indulge him\r\nwith a meeting. The weather proved stormy, and in the end the allies\r\nreturned in September to Cadiz without Palamos, and without a battle.\r\nRussell then sailed for home, and reached England after a prosperous\r\nvoyage early in November, leaving behind him a squadron under the\r\ncommand of Rear-Admiral David Mitchell. The impotent conclusion of\r\nthe attack on Palamos leaves us in some doubt whether Russell was not\r\nrather a fortunate than a spirited man. Yet his continuance abroad for\r\na year and a half, his wintering at Cadiz, and his two cruises in the\r\nMediterranean, did serve to prove that the allies had clearly gained\r\nthe upper hand at sea. They could not have remained for so long, nor\r\nhave cruised undisturbed, if the French had been in a position to use\r\ntheir fleet.\r\n\r\nThe end of these operations was somewhat tame. Sir David Mitchell\r\nhad been left with sixteen ships of the line of the middle and lower\r\nrates. On the 15th October Sir George Rooke arrived from England with\r\na squadron, and the total force of the allies was raised to thirty\r\nsail, exclusive of the small craft. Information, no more accurate than\r\nthe false report which drew Russell away from Palamos, led Rooke to\r\nbelieve that a powerful French fleet was coming to sea. He took refuge\r\nin Cadiz harbour, and there spent the winter. Sir David Mitchell was\r\nonce sent out in search of some French vessels said to be lying in\r\nLagos Bay, but they were not found, and the allies were otherwise\r\nquiescent. Meanwhile, King Louis was indeed preparing to make an\r\nattack, or rather a double attack, on King William. During the early\r\ndays of 1696 Sir John Fenwick’s assassination plot was hatching in\r\nEngland, to the knowledge and with the approval of the French sovereign\r\nand the exiled King James. Troops were collected at Calais to be pushed\r\nover so soon as the murder of King William was known to have been\r\nachieved. In the meanwhile a fleet of fifty-one sail was being prepared\r\nat Toulon with considerable difficulty, partly through the penury\r\nof the French Government, partly because of the pertinacity of its\r\nsailors in resisting or evading service. The object of this armament\r\nwas to provide a force which should be at hand to take advantage of\r\nthe confusion expected to ensue on the violent death of King William.\r\nIt is known to all that this complicated scheme of combined murder\r\nand military operations broke down. Fenwick’s plot was revealed to\r\nthe Government. The great ships which had come home with Russell in\r\nthe autumn were hurried to sea in February, and the French coast was\r\npatrolled and orders were sent to Rooke to return at once.\r\n\r\nThese orders reached him at a time when his mind was much exercised\r\nby reports of the approach of the French fleet from Toulon. He put to\r\nsea in the early days of March. The enemy had already sailed under the\r\ncommand of Châteaurenault. It is one more illustration of the rather\r\nmodest standard of efficiency expected from the ship of the time,\r\nthat to send a fleet to sea so early as March was counted hazardous.\r\nThe result went to show that the estimate was not wholly unjust.\r\nBoth fleets were scattered in a storm, and suffered damage. They\r\nreturned to port, but again put to sea so soon as their injuries were\r\nmade good. Rooke, who had the start, reached home on the 22nd April.\r\nChâteaurenault ran into Brest about a fortnight later—not unobserved,\r\nbut unopposed. This escape of his fleet was added to the list of naval\r\nmiscarriages of which Parliament was constantly complaining. Rooke\r\nand Mitchell were called to account, but no blame appears to have\r\nbeen thought to attach to them. Indeed, the error lay mainly in the\r\nGovernment. It ought to have kept a more powerful force in the Straits\r\nif it wished to prevent the French from leaving the Mediterranean.\r\nFenwick’s plot was the last resolute effort made by the enemy against\r\nthe Government established by the Revolution. Peace was becoming an\r\nabsolute necessity for France, and it was made at Ryswick in 1697.\r\n\r\nFor a brief space both sides took breath, and then the struggle began\r\nagain—the main cause being the resolution of the allies to prevent\r\nLouis XIV. from establishing a grandson of his own on the Spanish\r\nthrone on terms which would practically have annexed the vast\r\npossessions of the Spanish monarchy to the crown of France. England was\r\ndrawn into the struggle with reluctance, and was in fact only provoked\r\nto fight when the French King, subordinating his duties as a sovereign\r\nto his feelings as a gentleman, recognised the son of the exiled James\r\nII. as King of England.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Queen Anne brought one change to the government of the\r\nnavy. It had been the intention of King William in the last days of\r\nhis rule to re-establish a Lord High Admiral. The Earl of Pembroke was\r\nchosen for the place, and the admirals who were to act as his advisers\r\nwere named. By the king’s death all commissions were annulled, but his\r\nintention was carried out, though with a change of persons. The office\r\nof Lord High Admiral was revived in favour of the queen’s husband,\r\nPrince George of Denmark, who was provided with a council. Some fault\r\nwas found with the legality of this measure, but it passed without\r\nserious opposition—thanks to the popularity of the queen, and the fact\r\nthat public attention was turned elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe war, though essentially a continuation of the former struggle, was\r\nbegun, in so far at least as the naval side of it was concerned, in\r\nsomewhat changed conditions. A grandson of King Louis now sat on the\r\nthrone of Spain. It was the object of the allies, by whom, however,\r\nhe had been at first recognised, to compel him to resign. Therefore\r\nit was sure that he would be their enemy to the extent of his power.\r\nAn inevitable consequence of this change was that the allied English\r\nand Dutch fleets could no longer rely on being allowed to use Spanish\r\nports. One of the earliest measures taken by the Queen’s Government was\r\nto send an officer, Captain Loades, to Cadiz to bring away the naval\r\nstores kept there for the use of our ships serving in the Straits and\r\nthe Mediterranean. It shows to what an extent we had made use of this\r\nport, that the stores left there amounted to more than Loades could\r\nstow in the vessels with him. He was therefore compelled to sell part\r\nof them to the Spaniards at a loss. Two hulks belonging to us, and used\r\nfor the purpose of “heaving down,” that is, lightening, and pulling\r\non one side ships which it was necessary to clean when they returned\r\nfoul from a cruise, were towed out to sea and sunk. An experience of\r\nthis kind must have quickened our desire to obtain possession of a port\r\nentirely our own.\r\n\r\nThough Philip V. had been accepted by the Spaniards as their king, a\r\nparty in favour of the Hapsburg dynasty was known to exist, and to be\r\nstrong in the coast provinces. So upon the outbreak of the war in 1702,\r\na fleet of fifty sail, of which thirty were English and twenty were\r\nDutch, was sent to Cadiz under Rooke, carrying with it a strong force\r\nof soldiers under the Duke of Ormonde. It cleared the Channel on the\r\n21st July, and after looking into Corunna went on to the south. On the\r\n12th August it left Lisbon, which, since the Spanish ports were shut\r\nto us, and the King of Portugal was among the allies, had become our\r\nhouse of call and store magazine, as it had been in the Commonwealth\r\nwars. Very shortly the fleet was before Cadiz. The work to be done\r\nrequired, above all things, tact. It was the duty of the expedition\r\nto assail the Spaniards in so far as they were the armed supporters\r\nof King Philip V., but to propitiate them in so far as they were the\r\npotential supporters of the Hapsburg party. The chiefs so managed\r\nmatters that they took no effectual steps against the armed forces\r\nof King Philip, while they allowed grievous wrong to be inflicted on\r\nthe people of the country. Cadiz was bombarded to the injury of the\r\ninhabitants. Meanwhile the Puerto de Santa Maria, on the other side of\r\nthe bay, was occupied by the English and Dutch, who applied themselves\r\nto drunkenness, the rape of women, and deliberate insults to the Roman\r\nCatholic religion—three kinds of violence exquisitely adapted to excite\r\nthe scorn and hatred of the people of Andalusia. After a month and a\r\nlittle more of wrangling with one another, the chiefs, who could agree\r\non nothing else, agreed to come away.\r\n\r\nOn the way home, information was received that several Spanish treasure\r\ngalleons returning from America under protection of a French squadron\r\ncommanded by Châteaurenault had put into Vigo. Here was a definite\r\nobject offering a plain aim both to public spirit and private greed.\r\nDissensions ceased. Sailor and soldier united in vigorous co-operation.\r\nThere is a spacious outer bay at Vigo, and a convenient, though\r\nsmaller, inner anchorage reached through a narrow entry. A boom had\r\nbeen laid across this, and the French and Spaniards were anchored\r\nwithin. On the 12th October, the allies, led by Admiral Hopson,\r\ndashed at the boom while soldiers landed for the purpose turned the\r\nfortifications on shore. The French warships and Spanish galleons were\r\neither destroyed by the allies or by their own crews. The Government\r\ntreasure had been disembarked and was far inland, but a good deal of\r\nmiscellaneous pillage no doubt fell to the squadron and the troops. On\r\nthe 19th the expedition sailed away, and reached England on the 7th\r\nNovember. Its doings added another chapter to the dreary history of\r\nparliamentary debates on “naval miscarriages.”\r\n\r\nIn 1703 a Grand Fleet went out to the Mediterranean under command\r\nof Cloudesley Shovell. It swept the coasts of Spain and Provence,\r\nendeavouring to quicken the Hapsburg party in Spain and to send help\r\nto the Protestants of the Cevennes, who were in revolt against King\r\nLouis—with no success in either case. But the following year saw\r\noperations of another order, forming a fruitful campaign—movements of\r\nlarge hostile armaments over a great area, a balance of forces, and a\r\nclash of conflict leaving permanent results.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1703 the Archduke Charles, the Hapsburg claimant of\r\nthe Spanish throne, was brought over to this country by Rooke from\r\nHolland. It was the purpose of the Government to send him south with\r\nsuch a force as would enable him to vindicate his rights. After delays\r\ncaused by bad weather he sailed under the protection of Rooke on the\r\n12th February 1704. The English admiral had with him only ten sail of\r\nthe line, five English and five Dutch, but was accompanied by a swarm\r\nof transports and trading ships. He did not reach Lisbon till the 25th\r\nFebruary. On the 2nd March reinforcements reached him under command\r\nof Sir John Leake, and on the 9th he went to sea in order to cruise\r\nfor the outgoing Spanish trading fleet bound to the West Indies, which\r\nhe did not meet though he took several other prizes. Orders were sent\r\nhim to proceed up the Mediterranean for the purpose of forwarding\r\nthe Hapsburg cause and aiding the coast towns of our ally the Duke\r\nof Savoy. Rooke left Lisbon with thirty-seven sail, but no troops,\r\nand was off Cape St. Vincent on the 29th April. He now went on to\r\nthe Mediterranean. On the 8th May he was off Cape Palos, north-east\r\nof the Spanish port of Carthagena. Here a small squadron of French\r\nships was seen and chased. They were on their way to Cadiz. Complaints\r\nwere made that though they were overtaken they were not attacked, and\r\nstrong blame was thrown on Captain Andrew Leake for the failure. On\r\nthe 10th the detached squadron rejoined the admiral, and on the 19th\r\nthe fleet was off Barcelona. The Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, who was\r\nwith Rooke, had been governor of the province for King Charles II.,\r\nand he was convinced, rightly enough as subsequent events proved, that\r\nthe sympathies of the townsmen were with the Hapsburg cause. He wished\r\nto make an effort to induce them to rise, but Barcelona was held for\r\nKing Philip by a strong garrison under the command of Don Francisco\r\nde Velasco, a man of rigorous character. The Catalans, like our own\r\nancestors whether Whig or Jacobite, were too prudent to rise against\r\nregular soldiers till they were assured of solid support. This Rooke\r\ncould not give. He had no troops with him, and he held himself bound to\r\ngo on to the Riviera to aid the Duke of Savoy. A few hundred English\r\nand Dutch marines were landed, but no movement followed in the town,\r\nand they were re-embarked. Rooke therefore left the coast of Catalonia,\r\nand steered towards Provence.\r\n\r\nThe French fleet had left Brest early in May. It consisted of\r\ntwenty-three vessels, under the command of the Count of Toulouse, a\r\nbastard son of the king’s, and a simple-minded honest man of no great\r\nfaculty. The strain on the French king’s resources had not allowed him\r\nto equip great fleets in 1702 and 1703, but the events of those years\r\nshowed him that an effort must be made. In 1704 he ordered squadrons\r\nto be prepared both in Brest and Toulon. The object was to unite them\r\nin the Mediterranean, where they could cut short further intrigues\r\nwith the insurgent Huguenots, and give both moral and material support\r\nto his grandson in Spain. The English Government was aware of the\r\npreparations, and in April a strong fleet was collected in the Channel\r\nunder Shovell. He had orders to retire up Channel, bringing with him\r\nthe store ships loaded for the squadron at Lisbon, if the enemy came\r\non in great force. If, however, he heard that Toulouse had gone to the\r\nMediterranean, he was to follow with not more than twenty-two sail,\r\ntaking care to leave a sufficient force for the protection of trade in\r\nthe home waters. On the 12th May Shovell obtained information that the\r\nFrench had gone south, and he therefore detached Sir Stafford Fairborn\r\nwith light ships to Kinsale to act as a trade guard, and followed the\r\nenemy to the coast of Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Toulouse had a long start, and was nearing the\r\nneighbourhood of Rooke by the time Shovell reached Lisbon. In the\r\nlatter days of May the position was this. On the 25th Rooke was joined\r\nby frigate, with the news that a French fleet had passed the Rock of\r\nLisbon steering to the south. The frigate passed through the enemy\r\nat sea, and knew that they had entered the Mediterranean. Rooke also\r\nlearnt from other sources that the towns of the Duke of Savoy were in\r\nno danger. A council of war was held, and it was resolved to return\r\nto the Straits. If the French fleet was met on the way it was to be\r\nengaged. The Count of Toulouse, with twenty-three sail of the line, was\r\ncutting across the route of the allies and heading for Toulon. Another\r\nFrench squadron was getting ready in that port somewhat tardily.\r\nShovell was still distant, but was making his way out to join and put\r\nhimself under the orders of Rooke. All these forces were converging by\r\ndevious routes to a final clash of battle.\r\n\r\nImportant events were to take place before they met. On the 27th of May\r\nthe ships of Toulouse were sighted by the look-out vessels of Rooke’s\r\nfleet. But the abounding caution of the commanders of that generation\r\nwas shown once more. The average speed of the French ships was better\r\nthan that of the allies, yet it would have been possible to bring them\r\nto action by ordering all the ships to sail at their best rate of\r\nspeed in a “general chase,” when the quickest of the allies could have\r\novertaken the slowest of the French. But to do this appeared dangerous\r\nto the flag officers of 1704, since it might subject them to attack\r\nin detail, and they pursued in a body, regulating their speed by that\r\nof the slowest sailer among them. Thus the Count of Toulouse kept and\r\nimproved his lead. On the 29th the allies were within ninety miles of\r\nToulon. Then, fearing that all the French forces would unite and put\r\nthem at a disadvantage, they returned down the Mediterranean. On the\r\n14th June Rooke and Shovell united their forces in the Straits.\r\n\r\nSo far nothing very brilliant had been done, and the escape of Toulouse\r\nwith his far inferior fleet was even discreditable to the allies.\r\nBut now strong pressure was put on Rooke and his colleagues to act.\r\nHitherto the conduct of the naval war had been of a somewhat peddling\r\norder. The buccaneering achievement at Vigo stood alone as a feat of\r\nany brilliancy. In the beginning of the war the failure of an officer\r\nnamed Munden (brother of him who retook St. Helena from the Dutch) to\r\nstop some French ships at Corunna, and his acquittal by a somewhat\r\ncomplacent court martial, had roused fierce anger in the country. There\r\nhad since been a shameful business in the West Indies. The nation was\r\nbecoming thoroughly tired of “naval miscarriages,” and the ministry\r\nwas resolute that something should be done. Something doable lay at\r\nthe very hand of the allied fleet. After hesitation, and discussions\r\nin the inevitable councils of war, it was resolved to make an attempt\r\non Gibraltar, which Cromwell had indicated as a good post for us to\r\nhold half a century before. Though Rooke only acted under pressure,\r\nhis conduct now compares very favourably with that of Russell in 1695.\r\nIf he was slow and very cautious, at least he was resolute and exact.\r\nHe did not allow the mere wind of the French fleet at Toulon to draw\r\nhim off, but stood on guard with the bulk of his force, and sent in\r\na squadron under George Byng to bombard the town, while a body of\r\nmarines was landed under command of the Prince of Hesse, on the neck\r\nof the peninsula, to cut the garrison off from relief, at any rate,\r\nby small parties. Gibraltar even then was strong. Its fortification\r\nmounted a hundred guns, but its garrison of 150 men was ridiculously\r\ninadequate. On the 23rd the bombardment took place—the Spaniards making\r\nsuch reply as was possible to 150 men. The mole was swept by the fire\r\nof the ships’ guns, and then stormed by the sailors. An explosion,\r\neither deliberately caused by the Spaniards, or produced by one of our\r\nown men who dropped a light into a magazine, did considerable harm to\r\nthe stormers, and for a moment there was a panic. But the Spaniards\r\nwere too few to take advantage of the chance, or indeed to man the\r\nwalls. Next day the governor promised to surrender, and the town was\r\ndelivered on the 25th. The total loss of the allies was 60 killed and\r\n217 wounded, nearly twice the number of the Spanish garrison, and\r\nalmost all English. They shed their blood honourably and profitably in\r\nadding this noble fortress to the “patrimony of St. George”—happier men\r\nthan the thousands of their comrades who perished miserably in these\r\nwars, fever stricken in filthy ships, rotten with scurvy, starved, or\r\npoisoned by bad food.\r\n\r\nGibraltar newly taken, and shattered by the attack, was not as yet\r\ncapable of serving as a port of war for the fleet. Not even water\r\ncould be found in sufficient quantities. Twelve hundred marines were\r\nlanded to form a garrison capable of repelling any sudden attack from\r\nthe land, and a magazine was made up out of the stores of the ships.\r\nThen the allies stood over to Tetuan, and sought for provisions and\r\nwater among the Moors. On the 9th August they had obtained what they\r\nwanted, when the captain of the =Centurion=, who had been on the watch\r\nto the eastward, came in with the news that the French fleet was at\r\nhand. Though the course to be followed in the event of such a foreseen\r\noccurrence as this might have been maturely considered already, a\r\ncouncil of war had to be held. It was decided to work up towards the\r\nenemy, and give battle. If the Count of Toulouse, who, being to the\r\neastward, had the weather-gage in the easterly wind blowing at the\r\ntime, had been well advised, he would have forced on battle at once.\r\nBut he manœuvred to avoid action, and even fell back towards Malaga.\r\nThis gave the allies time to re-embark half the marines they had landed\r\nat Gibraltar. The meeting of the fleets was delayed till the 13th\r\nAugust. By that date the allies had got to windward of the French who\r\nwere now between them and the fortress. Both fleets were heading to the\r\nsouth. At ten o’clock in the morning the allied line bore down on the\r\nFrench. Sir Cloudesley Shovell and Leake led the van. Rooke commanded\r\nin the centre with Dilkes and Wishart. The Dutch formed the rear of\r\nthe line. In number of guns and ships the two fleets were fairly\r\nequal, but the allies were short handed, and in want of ammunition.\r\nThe course of the battle presented little of interest. Van was opposed\r\nto van, centre to centre, and rear to rear. They hammered each other\r\nwith their guns, and the valour shown was great. Sir John Leake, if his\r\nLife is to be trusted, did wish to do more than fire and be fired into.\r\nHe commanded the leading squadron in the allied line and was opposed\r\nto the French admiral, the Marquis de Villette Mursay. The French\r\nofficer’s ship, the _Intrépide_, caught fire in the poop, and he bore\r\nout of the line to extinguish the flames. This movement was understood\r\nas a signal by the ships of his squadron, and they followed him to\r\nleeward. Leake now wished to pursue and break through the French line,\r\nbut that fatal article in the Fighting Instructions, which prescribed\r\nthe maintenance of one order throughout the action, interfered. He was\r\ntold to remain where he was—and was reduced to be a spectator of the\r\nrest of the action, which took the form of a persevering exchange of\r\nblows between the centre and rear divisions of the two fleets. They\r\nseparated at four in the afternoon, both much damaged. The battle of\r\nMalaga was one of the most bloody ever fought at sea. Nearly 3000 men\r\nfell in the allied line, and the loss of the French, who however only\r\nacknowledged 1500, cannot well have been much less. On their side, too,\r\nan extraordinary number of officers of distinction were slain.\r\n\r\nFor two days the fleets remained near one another. The wind shifted to\r\nthe west, and gave the French the weather-gage, but they made no use of\r\nit to renew the battle. In the allied line many ships already depleted\r\nby the bombardment of the 23rd July, and the drafts made upon them to\r\nsupply the Prince of Hesse with a magazine, had fired away almost all\r\ntheir powder. Some had run short in the action. They were prepared to\r\naccept battle if it was forced upon them, with the resolution to board\r\nthe enemy, and settle it with cold steel since they could not use their\r\nguns. But in their hearts they were relieved—and no shame to them,\r\nand no credit to him—when Toulouse filed away northward to Toulon.\r\nThen they returned to Gibraltar Bay, where they remained till the 24th\r\nof August. The marines drawn from the garrison were again landed and\r\ndamages made good as far as might be. On that day Rooke sailed. On the\r\n26th he told off a squadron to remain on the coast of Portugal with\r\nLeake, and sailed with his battered ships and sorely tried crews for\r\nEngland, which he reached on the 25th September.\r\n\r\nGibraltar having been taken was to be held, and as it was not yet\r\nsufficiently settled to be able to rely for long on its own strength,\r\nits salvation depended on Leake’s squadron. Sir John was hardly a great\r\ncommander, yet from the day that he relieved Londonderry his conduct\r\nwas always marked by a certain alacrity in action. During the winter of\r\n1704-05, he stood by Gibraltar loyally and with energy. The Spaniards\r\nhad collected an army to retake the town, and early in October the\r\nPrince of Hesse called for help. Leake came at once from Lagos with\r\nstores and encouragement. On hearing that a French naval force was\r\napproaching, he put to sea. Uncertainty as to the strength of the\r\nenemy and some damage received by bad weather induced him to return to\r\nLisbon to refit, but he was back reinforced by the 29th October and\r\nhad the deserved good luck to capture three French warships. Leake now\r\nremained by Gibraltar till the 21st December. On both these visits\r\nhis guns relieved the pressure on the town by firing into the camp of\r\nthe besiegers. Then he again went back to Lisbon. During his absence\r\na French squadron under M. de Pointis arrived to form a blockade.\r\nOn the 10th March, Leake was back again, and this time he destroyed\r\nfive Frenchmen including the flagship in Gibraltar Bay. The remainder\r\nof Pointis’ ships fled to Toulon. Leake now remained till March.\r\nThe besieging army broke up its camp in despair, and Gibraltar was\r\nsafe. Leake was able to sail for England and reached it in April. As\r\nGibraltar had been taken, so it was saved by the fleet, for the sake of\r\nwhich we hold it, and on which in the last resort it depends.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking coincidence that the year of the taking of Gibraltar\r\nwas also the year of Blenheim. The superiority passed to the allies on\r\nland as well as on sea. Henceforth the French king could do less and\r\nless with his navy. Year after year the Grand Fleets poured out of the\r\nChannel in spring, and swept like a great tidal wave round the coasts\r\nof the Peninsula, and into the Gulf of Lyons. They made the capture of\r\nBarcelona, and its relief, possible. It was they who enabled General\r\nStanhope to take Port Mahon which, together with Gibraltar, remained\r\nin our hands at the end of the war. They kept the Hapsburg cause alive\r\nin Spain for a space. Yet their operations present only a repetition\r\nof similar incidents, and enforce always the same lessons: that where\r\nthe road lies over the sea, the ships only can stop it for an invader,\r\nor open it for invasion—an obvious but apparently an easily forgotten\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1704, Josiah Burchett, the Secretary of the Admiralty, had\r\noccasion to acknowledge the ill success of an expedition sent to the\r\nWest Indies during the reign of King William; “but,” he went on, “when\r\nhad we an opportunity, or at least when was there any attempt made by\r\nus from the beginning of the last war, to this very time, where the\r\nadvantage proved in any degree equal to the charge and inconveniences\r\nthat did attend it? The injuries we did to the French when Sir Francis\r\nWheeler commanded in the West Indies were inconsiderable, and what have\r\nour successes been before and after that expedition? I doubt it was\r\nfound that our squadrons came home in a much worse condition than when\r\nthey set forth, both as to men, and all other circumstances; and not\r\nhaving the good fortune to do any sensible injuries to our enemy, they\r\n(_i.e._ the enemy) had the satisfaction of knowing what inconveniences\r\nwe involved ourselves in.” The cruises carried out after 1704 might\r\nbe summed up in much the same terms. As we were then engaged against\r\nthe Spaniards as well as the French, a change was made in the scope of\r\nour operations. The peculiar character of Spanish trade with the new\r\nworld, in which the most valuable portion of the home-coming cargoes\r\nwas the bullion brought from the mines of Mexico and Peru, gave us\r\nan opportunity to achieve one success of a kind highly profitable to\r\nthe officers and men engaged. In 1709, Sir Charles Wager captured a\r\ntreasure ship, and he also inflicted loss on her companion ships, which\r\nwas most injurious to the Spaniards. But this action stands almost\r\napart in a long series of cruises of little interest, and no important\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe nature of these operations can be shown by a brief account of\r\nthe first. When the war began in 1689 it was felt that the French\r\nplantations in America, and more especially those in Hispaniola,\r\nrepresented a portion of the enemy’s resources which it was desirable\r\nto diminish. The English officers in America were ordered to molest the\r\nFrench to the utmost of their ability. In order that they might be the\r\nbetter able to perform this duty they were reinforced by a squadron\r\nfrom Europe. It consisted of one third rate, seven fourth rates, one\r\nfifth rate, and of two fireships, and was commanded by Captain Lawrence\r\nWright, an officer of some five-and-twenty years’ standing, who had\r\nbeen in the West Indies before. His orders were to ship the Duke of\r\nBolton’s regiment of foot at Plymouth, and to sail for the Leeward\r\nIslands, that is the more northerly of the Lesser Antilles which\r\nstretch from the Virgin Islands to Dominica. Here he was to co-operate\r\nwith Colonel Codrington, the governor, whose headquarters were at\r\nAntigua. The governor was to add what forces he could, and attacks were\r\nthen to be made upon the French. Elaborate directions were given to\r\nWright—that he was to be guided by a council of war, to act in so far\r\nas operations on shore were concerned, under the general direction of\r\nthe military officers, to spare what sailors he could for operations on\r\nland, and not to send ships from his squadron without consent of the\r\ngovernor and council, lest the islands should be “exposed to insults.”\r\n\r\nThus directed, and with these limited powers, Captain Wright sailed\r\nfrom Plymouth on the 8th March 1690 with a number of merchant ships\r\nunder his protection. Storms scattered the convoy immediately after it\r\nleft the Channel, but it arrived safe at Madeira on the 2nd of April.\r\nOn the 11th May it reached Barbadoes. Though only two months had passed\r\nsince the squadron had left England, and it had stopped at Madeira,\r\nthe crews were so sickly, presumably from scurvy, that Captain Wright\r\nwas compelled to land many of his men to be cured, and could not sail\r\ntill the 27th May. On the 30th of the month he reached Antigua. Colonel\r\nCodrington joined him with some soldiers, and a series of buccaneering\r\noperations was begun against the French at St. Christopher, and St.\r\nEustatius to the west of Antigua, and at no great distance. Men were\r\nlanded, forts taken, plantations plundered and burnt, negroes carried\r\noff. No attempt was made to hold the French islands, and this form of\r\npurely destructive warfare went on till about the middle of July. The\r\nhurricane months (July, August, and September) were now upon them,\r\nboth sailors and soldiers were sickly, and the expedition returned to\r\nAntigua. Wright went out to Barbadoes, and there remained till the 6th\r\nOctober. The island lies out of the usual track of the hurricane, and\r\nthat danger is considered to be “all over” in October, though there\r\nhave been some notable and destructive exceptions to these rules.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th October, Wright again sailed to join Codrington at Antigua,\r\nand a plan was laid for attacking the French island of Guadaloupe. It\r\nis to be noted that Wright’s crews having been sorely diminished by\r\nsickness, he had been compelled to press sailors from the merchant\r\nships at Barbadoes. While the English squadron was collected for the\r\npurpose of attacking St. Christopher, the French privateers sailing\r\nfrom Hispaniola, Martinique and Guadaloupe, had been very busy. They\r\nwere known to have captured numbers of our merchant ships, and the\r\ntrade was threatened with ruin. Some of them cruised at their ease\r\nwithin sight of the shore at Barbadoes, taking the small vessels\r\nemployed to bring from Virginia the bacon and maize which were the\r\nprovisions needed for the negro slaves. There was even danger of\r\nfamine. At Antigua, Wright was called off by orders to sail for\r\nEngland, and did actually come back as far as Barbadoes. Here, however,\r\ncounter-orders were sent him to remain, and promises of reinforcements.\r\nIn January of 1691 store ships, and one man-of-war, reached him. This\r\naddition to his force, small as it was, was yet welcome, for he had\r\nbeen compelled to detach vessels on convoy service, doubtless in answer\r\nto the loud outcries of the merchants. In February he again joined\r\nCodrington, and the scheme of attacking Guadaloupe was resumed. On the\r\n27th of that month, Marie Galante, a little outlying island just south\r\nof Guadaloupe, was raided with the usual details of plunder and arson.\r\nThen a landing was effected on Guadaloupe, but in May these unworthy\r\noperations were brought to an end by the report that a French squadron\r\nhad reached Martinique from Europe, and was coming on. At once the\r\ntroops were re-embarked, not without signs of panic, and a council of\r\nwar decided to return to Barbadoes. Wright and Codrington had come\r\nto open quarrel. At Barbadoes the naval chiefs health broke down. He\r\nresigned his command, and sailed for home. Some of the ships followed\r\nhim with a convoy. Others remained in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nWright, who left Barbadoes amid a chorus of jeers and accusations of\r\ncowardice, may fairly be considered to have had hard measure. He was\r\nnever again employed at sea, though he held some dock-yard posts.\r\nThere is nothing to show that he was a man to rise above adverse\r\ncircumstances, but the bare narrative of the events of the cruise given\r\nabove is his best excuse. Let us look at the facts, bearing meanwhile\r\nin mind that what is to be said of them applies in different degrees,\r\nbut always to some extent, to every expedition we sent to the West\r\nIndies from the beginning of the war in 1689 down to the peace of\r\nUtrecht. In the first place the material force given to the commander\r\nwas inadequate to the work he had to do. It was not sufficient to\r\ncapture the principal French posts, yet he was ordered to make attacks\r\non the enemy’s territory. The inevitable result was that, while he had\r\nhis ships concentrated for miserable burning and plundering raids, the\r\nFrench privateers cruised unchecked. The blame for this rests mainly\r\non the Government. It repeated in the West Indies the very mistake of\r\nordering attacks on coast towns with insufficient forces, which as\r\nwe have seen it was also making in the Channel. Then these material\r\nforces, too weak in themselves to begin with, suffered from causes\r\nserious enough to have paralysed greater powers. It was a brutal and\r\ngreedy generation, callously indifferent to the well-being of the\r\nmen. The younger Hawkins, and Lancaster—the captain of the East India\r\nCompany—had shown how to keep crews healthy on long voyages even in the\r\ntropics. We had the example of the Dutch to guide us. Yet the chiefs of\r\nthe navy allowed their men to rot from scurvy and perish by fever, not\r\nfrom want of knowledge, which they could have acquired at once if they\r\nhad looked for it, but from mere hardness of heart and selfishness. The\r\ndestruction of life by disease in our fleets was everywhere great, and\r\nin the West Indies it was enormous. Of the superior officers who sailed\r\nwith Admiral Nevill in 1696-1697 only one captain lived to return home.\r\nThe pestiferous squalor of the lower deck avenged the sailors. At the\r\nclose of Captain R. Wilmot’s expedition of 1695 one vessel was lost on\r\nthe reefs of Florida, from sheer want of men to handle her sails. The\r\nsailors followed the example set them, and were affected by the spirit\r\nof their time. They found consolation for the hardships of life afloat\r\nin excesses on shore. Burchett assures us that the harbours of the West\r\nIndies were more fatal to the men than the sea.\r\n\r\nIn this atmosphere, as of a town smitten by plague where men hasten\r\nto enjoy while they can, sailors and soldiers were sent to plunder.\r\nEach soon began to suspect the other of attempting to defraud, and\r\nthe passions of disappointed gamblers were added to the professional\r\nrivalry of men who in that generation were rarely honest enough to\r\nsubordinate their passions to the general good of “the king’s service.”\r\nThe fierce feuds of sailor and soldier flamed up in these expeditions,\r\nbut the case of Admiral Benbow shows that a British admiral of that\r\ngeneration could not always rely on loyal and honest support even from\r\nhis subordinates. Add to this, that jarring soldier and sailor elements\r\nwere constantly called upon to combine in councils, and that they were\r\nboth subjected to a vague check by the governors and councils of the\r\nislands. In such conditions effective operations were not possible.\r\n\r\nWhile the Grand Fleets were cruising, often unopposed and never\r\neffectually checked by the French, while the colonial expeditions\r\nsailed year after year to fail, or at the best to achieve half\r\nsuccesses, by their own defects rather than from the strength of their\r\nenemy, the allies suffered severely at sea from the enterprise of\r\nthe corsairs who won for France nearly all the glory and profit she\r\ngained from these naval wars. This side of the struggle is of peculiar,\r\nindeed it may be said to be of contemporary, interest. French writers\r\nare fond of dwelling on the success of their privateers in the later\r\nseventeenth, and early eighteenth centuries. They argue that it proves\r\ntheir national aptitude for swift destructive attacks on trade, and\r\ndraw the deduction that if ever war breaks out again between them and\r\nus, they must revert to the methods of the men who, if they could not\r\ndisturb the movements of the great allied fleets, did at least make the\r\nconflict costly to English and Dutch commerce. It is their belief that\r\nif they can only do what those adventurers did on a somewhat larger\r\nscale, then England, which is far more dependent on trade than she then\r\nwas, and is now under the obligation to import large quantities of\r\nfood, which was not then the case, will find her superiority in fleets\r\nof no avail. We are looking then at what concerns us directly when we\r\nturn our attention to the doings of the French corsairs between 1689\r\nand 1712.\r\n\r\nOwing to a combination of circumstances the _guerrillero_, or partisan\r\nwar of the sea, was then conducted in exceptionally favourable\r\nconditions. When they have been detailed, and the results reached\r\nhave been summed up, we shall be in a position to judge how far those\r\nconditions, favourable as they were to the corsairs, were also of\r\nadvantage to our enemy. This failure of the French fleet had a double\r\neffect. French coasting trade conducted in small vessels, fitted\r\nto hug the shore and take refuge under coast batteries, went on,\r\ndisturbed, but not destroyed. But French oversea commerce was almost\r\nwholly suspended. Thus numbers of men were thrown out of employment,\r\nand the shipowners were driven to look elsewhere for profit. Both were\r\ninevitably turned to privateering. We had seen the same consequence\r\nensue in Elizabeth’s reign, when the Spanish war interrupted our chief\r\noversea trade. Again, so soon as the great fleets had no longer to\r\nbe manned for cruising, the king had a strong motive to find other\r\nemployment for his sailors and his officers. Therefore he allowed\r\nthem to go on privateering voyages, and even hired out his vessels\r\nfor the purpose or entered into partnership with the owners. Here\r\nagain our own Elizabethan precedent was closely, if unconsciously,\r\nfollowed. Similar causes produced similar results, and as Elizabeth\r\nbecame the partner of “adventurers” on plundering expeditions to the\r\nWest Indies, or to Cadiz, so King Louis entered into contracts with\r\nhis _armateurs_ for similar ventures. Finally, the French leaders of\r\nthat generation were of much the same stamp as our Elizabethans. M. de\r\nPointis, the Chevalier de Saint Pol, the Count de Forbin, Jean Bart,\r\nand Duguay-Trouin were the French equivalents of Raleigh, Cumberland,\r\nDrake, Frobisher, and Hawkins. Some of them won their way to social\r\nposition, and the royal service, by good fighting in the privateers.\r\nOthers were king’s officers lent for the work.\r\n\r\nWhile Tourville kept the sea, the share of the privateers in the war\r\nwas small, and the harm they did very trifling in comparison to the\r\ninjury inflicted on the Smyrna convoy by the French fleet in 1693. Only\r\na part of their total later activity in the war directly concerned\r\nus. Jean Bart, a Fleming of the Flemish town of Dunkirk, cruised\r\nmainly against the Dutch in the North Seas. The two greatest single\r\nachievements of the French privateers, the capture of Carthagena by\r\nM. de Pointis in the reign of King William (1697), and the capture of\r\nRio de Janeiro by Duguay-Trouin in the reign of Queen Anne (1711),\r\nwere directed against the Spaniards and the Portuguese respectively.\r\nThey were very similar to Drake’s raid on the West Indies in 1585.\r\nThe Dunkirk privateers preyed on our commerce after their town had\r\nbecome French, as they had done while it formed part of the Low Country\r\npossessions of the King of Spain. We blockaded it with indifferent\r\nsuccess. Other ports also sent out their corsairs. Our chief interest\r\nis with the Breton town of St. Malo, and with the activity of its\r\nhero Réné Duguay-Trouin. He used other ports, Dunkirk or Rochelle\r\noccasionally, and Brest often. He co-operated with other men, notably\r\nwith the Count of Forbin, but St. Malo was his headquarters and also\r\nthe typical corsair town, while he was the central dominating figure of\r\nthe corsair war. Jean Bart died in the middle of the conflict. Forbin\r\nhad other activities. Saint Pol, Nesmond, and many more who could be\r\nnamed, were subordinate. Following the scheme of this book, I take him\r\nas the characteristic illuminative example.\r\n\r\nThe Breton town of St. Malo stands on the northern coast of the Duchy\r\ntowards the eastern end, and close to Normandy. It is on the eastern\r\nend and at the mouth of the Rance. At that time it was still an island,\r\nnot yet turned into a peninsula by a causeway. It was surrounded by\r\nancient mediæval walls of less extent than the present fortifications.\r\nThe population were seamen, traders in peace, corsairs in war. There\r\nwere local leaders, burgesses not counted as nobles, but in the odd old\r\nFrench phrase “living nobly” as merchants and shipowners, not by retail\r\ntrade, nor manual labour. The approach to the Rance is dangerous,\r\nthrough reefs and over a bar, but there is good anchorage inside. The\r\nprivateers of St. Malo had been recognised as a useful force, and their\r\norganisation had been controlled by the crown since the fifteenth\r\ncentury. It had been finally fixed by Colbert. The captains sailed with\r\na recognised commission and large powers, extending even to life and\r\ndeath, for the maintenance of discipline. The crews were recruited by\r\nfree enlistment, and received wages, which might go to fifteen crowns\r\nfor the _course_ or cruise of four months. Custom, embodied in royal\r\nordinances, regulated the division of the prize. After payment of legal\r\nexpenses, and of ten per cent. to the Admiralty of Brittany (a separate\r\noffice from the Admiralty of France), two-thirds belonged to the owner,\r\nand the remaining third was divided among the officers on a fixed\r\nscale, while the men were rewarded at discretion by gifts in addition\r\nto their wages. When the king lent the ship he took a fifth of the\r\nprize, after the deduction of legal expenses, and admiral’s fees. The\r\nadventurers who helped to fit the vessel out, with their officers and\r\nthe crew, divided the remainder.\r\n\r\nAmong the _armateurs_, merchants, and shipowners of St. Malo “living\r\nnobly,” the family of Trouin had a conspicuous place. Luc Trouin de\r\nla Barbinais, father of the corsair, had himself served against the\r\nDutch and Spaniards. Réné, who afterwards added Duguay to his name to\r\ndistinguish himself from his elder brother, was a younger son of a\r\nlarge household. His parents had intended him for a priest, and he had\r\nsome schooling from the Jesuits at Rouen. But he was not made for the\r\nchurch. When the war opened in 1689 he was seventeen years old, and his\r\nfamily allowed him to follow his natural bent. He began his career as\r\na volunteer in one of the ships of the firm. These were light craft,\r\nprovided with guns, but relying mainly on their large crews. It was\r\nnot their interest to destroy their prize, so whether she was a small\r\nwarship (a large one they would naturally avoid) or a merchant vessel,\r\ntheir method was always the same, namely, to run alongside, or to run\r\nthe bowsprit over the waist of their opponent, and to carry her at a\r\nrush. A very short apprenticeship was considered enough for one of\r\nthe owners’ family. In his second year the young Réné was already in\r\ncommand of a light cruiser. In 1692 he captured an English convoy. In\r\n1693 he cruised at the mouth of the Channel in the _Hercule_, 30, and\r\ntook two rich English prizes. In 1694 he commanded the _Diligente_,\r\n36, and after some success was captured by an English squadron. He was\r\ncarried as prisoner to Plymouth, but escaped by the help of a pretty\r\nshop girl who had a lover among the gaolers. At that time he was in\r\nperil of severe treatment, for he had broken the laws of war, out of\r\nbravado, by firing a derisive shot at a heavy English vessel before\r\nhoisting his own flag and sailing off. After his escape his brother\r\ngave him the _Francois_, 48. In this vessel he took part in the capture\r\nof an English convoy protected by two men-of-war, the =Sanspareil= and\r\nthe =Boston=. Here we have to note that a change—a very significant\r\nchange—came over the corsair war about this time.\r\n\r\nIn the first three years of the war the privateers cruised alone,\r\npicking up what straggling merchant ships they met. But the allies\r\nanswered by sending their trade under protection of warships in\r\nconvoys. It therefore became necessary to make the attack with forces\r\ncapable of overcoming the guard. So the corsairs began to cruise in\r\nwell-appointed squadrons of four, six, or ten ships, in part commonly\r\nsupplied by the king. These forces flew at far higher game than\r\nthe straggling merchant ship. Their course was identical with that\r\nfollowing in the ensuing century by Hawke, when he assailed Desherbiers\r\nde l’Etenduère, namely, to fall upon the warships first. When the\r\nFrench were in sufficient numbers both to throw a superior force on\r\nthe men-of-war, and to spare vessels to capture the merchant ships at\r\nonce, they did so; when this was not the case they disposed of the\r\narmed guard. They made no attempt to form a precise order themselves,\r\nbut swept down on the guardships of the convoy, attacking always by\r\ntwo or more against one, and overpowering their enemy in detail. The\r\nprotecting English and Dutch ships made many gallant fights, but they\r\nshowed little readiness to meet attack by counter-attack. It was their\r\ncustom to form a line and wait to be assailed. This passive attitude\r\nleft the Frenchman free to make his arrangements as he pleased.\r\nDuguay-Trouin, and his colleagues, still relied much upon large crews,\r\nand upon boarding. Yet an alert, well-handled ship could often avoid\r\nbeing grappled. For instance, we often hear how a French corsair swept\r\ndown on the side of some Englishman or Dutchman, but failed to grapple\r\nbecause the wary opponent had “thrown all aback,” that is to say, had\r\npulled the yards round so as to present the front of the sails to the\r\nwind. This would stop his motion, and begin to make him move backwards.\r\nIf now the attacking ship, which by the necessity of the case would be\r\ngoing with the impetus of high speed, ranged up alongside she might\r\nmiss her aim, or the large iron hooks called grappling-irons, which\r\nshe threw out to take hold of her prey, might not get fixed; or again\r\nthey might, but the ropes to which they are fastened broke under the\r\nstrain of the diverging masses. Then the assailant would shoot ahead,\r\nand the vessel attacked would have a chance to cross her path, and\r\nsweep her with a broadside. In order to have something more than the\r\nboarders to rely on, the corsairs increased the size of their vessels\r\nand broadsides, till they sailed with ships of fifty-six guns. Still\r\nthe favourite method of the corsairs was to rush to close quarters, on\r\nboth sides at once when they could, and throw an irresistible force of\r\nboarders on the enemy’s deck.\r\n\r\nMany hot fights of this kind took place in both divisions of the war.\r\nOne of the most desperate was fought in 1697 between Duguay-Trouin and\r\nthe Dutch Bilbao convoy under Baron Wassenaer. The years from 1693 to\r\n1697 were, on the whole, at least in so far as we were concerned, the\r\nmost profitable to the corsairs. Our navy was still staggering from the\r\nadministrative vices of King Charles’s reign, and the Government was\r\nhampered by financial embarrassments. The merchants complained that the\r\nprotection was insufficient, and was supplied late, so that they lost\r\nthe season, and the market, and were put to heavy expense while waiting\r\nfor their guard. Officials replied that they did what they could, and\r\naccused the merchant captains of bringing misfortunes on themselves\r\nby leaving the protection of the warships, to hurry on as they neared\r\nhome. There was truth on both sides. It is certain that merchant\r\nskippers both then, and for long afterwards, were often tempted to run\r\nrisks by the hope of getting in early, and well ahead of competitors\r\nin the market. Yet the constant successes of the privateers show that\r\nthe navy was not well handled.\r\n\r\nWe renewed the war in more favourable conditions, and with a better\r\nexperience. On the whole, the corsairs had far less success.\r\nNevertheless, even in this period, Duguay-Trouin hit us some shrewd\r\nblows. In 1705 he took a large English man-of-war, the =Elisabeth=. In\r\n1707 he sailed in combination with Forbin, at the head of a squadron\r\nof twelve vessels. Their orders were to intercept a convoy of military\r\nstores which the English Government was sending to Spain under the\r\nprotection of three large men-of-war, the =Devonshire=, 80, the\r\n=Cumberland=, 80, and the =Royal Oak=, 74, with the =Chester= and the\r\n=Ruby= of 50 guns. It was met, and scattered off the Lizard on the 10th\r\nOctober after very hard fighting. The English captains fought most\r\nbravely, but no more can be said in their favour. Though our squadron\r\nwas outnumbered it contained three vessels far superior in strength\r\nto any among the French. Moreover, they were divided when the action\r\nwas begun by Duguay-Trouin who rushed straight at us. Yet Captain\r\nRichard Edwards who commanded did not attempt to do more than present a\r\ndefensive barrier between the merchant ships and the oncoming French,\r\nwho were thus able to concentrate as they pleased, and crush him in\r\ndetail. As a captain he did his duty manfully, fighting his ship, the\r\n=Cumberland=, till she was dismasted, and unable to resist further.\r\nThe =Chester= and =Ruby= were also taken. The =Devonshire= fought till\r\nevening, when she blew up with the loss of all her crew, except three,\r\nand of three hundred soldiers she was carrying out to Spain. While this\r\nfierce conflict was in progress, the transports and merchant ships made\r\ntheir escape, and most of them reached Lisbon.\r\n\r\nHere we might leave Duguay-Trouin, for his later services did not\r\ngreatly concern us. Yet it belongs to our story to record that in the\r\nfollowing year he cruised with ten ships, hired by, or belonging to,\r\nhimself and his brothers. No prize was met, and the expense of keeping\r\nso many vessels at sea to no purpose nearly brought the house of Trouin\r\nto ruin. This fact in his career supplies an opportunity for summing up\r\nthe corsair war. It brought him, we see, fame but not profit, and it\r\nmay be added that this is what it did for France. Looking at it as a\r\nwhole we note that it gives no support to the often-renewed contention,\r\nthat attacks by cruisers on sea-borne trade can of themselves bring a\r\nmaritime power to submission. The work, often tried, has never been\r\nbetter done, and we may feel sure never will be better done than by\r\nDuguay-Trouin, and the men he represents here. Yet we see that it\r\ndid not stop the march of the Grand Fleets of the allies for a day,\r\nnor did it ever dam up the main stream of their commerce. Again, the\r\nachievements of this famous corsair do by no means prove that single\r\nships, however swift, can destroy commerce. It was while trying to prey\r\non our shipping single-handed that Duguay-Trouin became a prisoner at\r\nPlymouth. Precisely the same experience befell Jean Bart, and Forbin\r\nat Portsmouth. Their successes were gained in well-appointed squadrons\r\nable to meet the shock of battle. The moral of the story is that a\r\nmaritime power can always defeat the attacks of single ships on its\r\ntrade by giving convoy. The protecting squadron can only be overpowered\r\nby a force like itself, and we come at once to operations of war far\r\nbeyond the power of the mere corsair or commerce destroyer who relies\r\non his speed only. Success in these operations must finally fall to\r\nwhichever side possesses the most numerous, and the best-appointed\r\nsquadrons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MEN AND THE LIFE\r\n\r\n AUTHORITIES.—This chapter has been founded mainly on: _Rooke’s\r\n     Journal_, published for the Navy Records Society; the Minutes\r\n     of the Court-Martial on Stucley and Brookes of the =Milford=;\r\n     Lillingston’s _Reflections on Mr. Burchett’s Memoirs_, and\r\n     Burchett’s _Justification of his Naval Memoirs_, published\r\n     separately, but sometimes found together; Maydman’s _Naval\r\n     Politics_; and William Hodge’s _An Humble Supplication of the\r\n     Seamen’s Misery_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the war of the Spanish Succession came to an end, the navy held\r\nperhaps an even higher place than it has occupied since. At the signing\r\nof the Peace of Utrecht, Great Britain was not so much the greatest\r\nnaval power in the world as the only power. Holland had been overtaxed\r\nby the necessity of taking a foremost place in the war on land; France\r\nwas bled nearly to death; Spain had ceased to possess even the show\r\nof a fleet. The Scandinavian nations and Russia were confined to the\r\nBaltic. Elsewhere there was nothing. In the midst of this general\r\nprostration we ruled at sea, not only without an equal, but without a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThere was a great danger in a supremacy of this nature. In the\r\nkingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, and he who is the\r\nbest because the others are very bad may himself be far from good.\r\nThe truth concerning the British navy during the earlier eighteenth\r\ncentury is that it owed at least as much to fortune as to its merits.\r\nAt heart it was sound, and moreover it existed by a necessity, and in\r\nconformity with the nature of things, since it was for this country the\r\nindispensable instrument not only of power but of safety. Therefore\r\nit could not absolutely fail till the nation behind it withered. None\r\nthe less it was hampered by defects, which might well have proved\r\nall but ruinous, had our enemy been more capable. Yet that he sank\r\nso completely by his own weakness was perhaps, in the long run, a\r\nmisfortune to us. A sound beating at some not vital point, which could\r\nhave been demonstrated to be the result of maladministration, would\r\nprobably have roused the nation into taking the Admiralty and the\r\nnavy in hand, and would have been for our good. No such lesson was\r\ninflicted, and we drowsed on in rather ignoble toleration for a dull\r\nhalf-century. A sound beating at some not vital point which could have\r\nbeen shown to be the result of pedantic adherence to a stupid method of\r\nfighting might have stung the navy itself into intellectual activity.\r\nAgain no such lesson was given, and the navy drowsed on in brainless\r\nacquiescence to the Fighting Instructions. Great then as our position\r\nwas, when compared with our neighbours’, we were yet at a level from\r\nwhich we could not have sunk without becoming dangerously bad.\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact that the mere quality of our ships was poor.\r\nThe superiority of the French shipbuilding, already noticeable in\r\nthe reign of Charles II., was maintained for long. When Spain began\r\nto revive under the Bourbon dynasty she also constructed vessels far\r\nsuperior to ours. In the year after the renewal of warfare in 1739\r\na Spanish 70-gunship, the _Princesa_, which however only mounted 64\r\nguns, was taken by three English vessels of the same rate. It cost\r\nthem five hours and a half of fighting to get her, and although this\r\nno doubt speaks well for her captain and crew, her long resistance to\r\napparently overwhelming force was largely due to her fine build. She\r\nwas of 1709 tons, whereas English vessels of the same rating were only\r\nof 1225; therefore she would be stronger and could carry a heavier\r\nbattery. Her lower deck ports were higher out of the water, and could\r\nbe worked when ours had to be closed in bad weather. The inferiority\r\nof our ships, rate for rate, to the French and Spanish had been noted\r\nbefore, and had produced some effect, but the capture of the _Princesa_\r\ngave a much needed stimulus. Nor was it only in size, and what depends\r\non size, that our ships were inferior. Their lines were poor, so that\r\nthey were crank (_i.e._ liable to overturn) and sailed badly. To some\r\nextent this inferiority of our models was due to economy. The Admiralty\r\nmade its vessels of weak scantling, that is with a minimum of timber,\r\nand preferred to patch up old ships rather than build new ones, and\r\ntherefore perpetuated inferior types. This was also part of the general\r\nslackness of the time. We were content to be guided by routine, and to\r\nleave the building of our ships in the hands of shipwrights who were\r\nmere artisans going by traditional rule of thumb.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of knowing what sort of men the officers and crews\r\nof our old navy were is very great. They have left small record of\r\nthemselves, and they were too remote from the general life of their\r\ntime to come under the notice of ordinary witnesses. The pictures\r\nwe do possess of them are mostly drawn by satirists of whom one\r\nonly, Smollett, was a man of genius and had personal experience.\r\nUnfortunately his spirit was bitter, and his purpose led him to pick\r\nout mainly the most extravagant and worst parts of his subject. Records\r\nof courts martial, again, tell a good deal, but it is necessary to\r\nremember they also are of the nature of selections of the worst. It was\r\nthe bad not the good officer who came before a court martial. Pamphlet\r\ncontroversies reveal something, but once more it is the worst. That our\r\nnavy sailed the sea in such bad ships with comparatively few disasters\r\nis proof of its seamanship. That its fighting was on the whole\r\nsuccessful, in spite of absurd rules and of defective intelligence in\r\nleadership, shows that though the head lay wrong, the heart was right.\r\nAll the materials were there, they only wanted better handling.\r\n\r\nThe evils afflicting the navy are easy enough to see. First among them\r\nwas brutality. The times were hard. A glance at the trials which arose\r\nout of General Oglethorpe’s agitation against the management of some of\r\nour prisons will show how callous our ancestors could be in the early\r\neighteenth century. The navy produced no General Oglethorpe. Though\r\nmany officers sat in Parliament, none of them made a serious attempt\r\nto check the unquestionable ill-usage of the sailors. From that we may\r\ndraw the deduction that they wanted humanity to incur the ill-will of\r\nthe Admiralty by insisting on reform, or that they were indifferent\r\nto the miseries of others; or finally that, like the Roman Prefectus\r\nCastrorum, who had been a common soldier, and who was known to the men\r\nas “Bring another,” because he was for ever breaking sticks on their\r\nbacks and calling for more, they were all the harder because they\r\nthemselves had suffered.\r\n\r\nHere is one brief passage of naval manners in the early eighteenth\r\ncentury, written by a naval pen in the Journal of Rooke’s expedition to\r\nCadiz in 1702:—\r\n\r\n “At six this evening Captain Norris coming on board this ship [the\r\n flagship] my Lord Hamilton, Captain Ley, Captain Wishart, and Captain\r\n Trevor, were standing on the quarter-deck, and as Captain Norris came\r\n up, Lord Hamilton asked him if he had taken any more wine or brandy.\r\n This means whether he had captured a ship laden with this kind of\r\n cargo. The other answered No; upon which Captain Trevor asked the\r\n price of his claret, whether he might have any at 4 li a hogshead.\r\n Norris said he would have 6 li or salt water, and then Captain Ley\r\n said he would rather the prizes were ashore than he would give the 6\r\n li the hogshead; upon which Captain Norris said he was a rascal that\r\n he wished his prizes ashore; the other replied he was a rascal if he\r\n called him so; and then Captain Norris struck Captain Ley and threw\r\n him over the gun, which Mr. Hopsonn hearing, as he and I were in my\r\n cabin, ran out, and upon inquiry found he [Norris] had hurt Captain\r\n Ley, and by the admiral’s directions ordered him to be confined, upon\r\n which Captain Norris drew his sword, and offered to stab Captain Ley,\r\n but Admiral Hopsonn, holding his hand, ordered him to be disarmed, and\r\n confined in Mr. Rayney’s cabin.”\r\n\r\nIt is a scene of huckstering and violence on the very quarter-deck of\r\nthe flagship. Yet though Ley died soon afterwards, perhaps from the\r\neffect of the blow, Norris was never called to account, and lived to be\r\nthe most distinguished officer of the reign of George I. and the early\r\nyears of George II.\r\n\r\nThe same Journal, under an earlier date, makes mention of one Captain\r\nWilliam Moses of the =Milford= who accused his lieutenant and one of\r\nhis midshipmen of attempting to murder him. It turned out on inquiry\r\nthat he had wounded himself, in order to bolster up charges which he\r\nwas bringing against these officers. They were brought to a court\r\nmartial, the lieutenant was acquitted, and the midshipman let off with\r\na mild rebuke. The story of this latter, whose name was Cæsar Brookes,\r\nis worth quoting from the minutes of the court martial.\r\n\r\nThe witnesses, who disagree in many details, are at one in saying\r\nthat in the middle watch of a certain night, when the ship was on the\r\ncoast of Africa, the captain, one Mr. Mite a passenger, and various\r\nofficers, were sitting together on the quarter-deck drinking wine. Here\r\nthe agreement ceases. Mr. Cæsar Brookes joined the party, and then,\r\naccording to the captain, he voluntarily, without provocation, and out\r\nof pure native arrogance, advanced the proposition that he could fight\r\nany two men—nay, he swore he could. For this he was rebuked by the\r\ncaptain, who told him he might perchance meet one who was a better man\r\nthan himself. To this Mr. Brookes, flaming into outrageous disrespect,\r\nanswered, “Well, damme, you’re not,” and was thereupon justly confined\r\nfor his mutinous behaviour. Brookes gives a very different version of\r\nthe affair. According to him, he was only arguing that in defending\r\nnarrow passages one man, if conveniently placed, could fight two—a\r\nscientific question of shock tactics, in fact, very proper for an\r\nofficer to discuss. For this he was first abused and then put under\r\narrest, though his carriage throughout was of the most respectful\r\nkind. The witnesses do not, with two suspicious exceptions, support\r\nthe captain’s version of what took place. The exceptions are sailors\r\nwho tell the same tale like parrots. One of them had been let out of\r\nirons by the captain, although he had beaten the gunner, after the\r\nquarter-deck scene be it observed. If the court martial thought that\r\nCaptain Moses had been attempting subornation of perjury, it was not\r\nwithout excuse. Now follows a scene in the captain’s cabin, in which,\r\n_teste_ Captain Moses, he was bearded by his extra midshipman; but Mr.\r\nBrookes says it was otherwise, and that he was assaulted. Certain it\r\nis that the midshipman remained in confinement for six mortal months\r\nin the sweltering heat of the Guinea Coast. At Cape Coast Castle,\r\nCaptain Moses had reason to believe that his life was threatened by\r\nthe implacable and unbridled Brookes. It seems that Mr. Donnidge the\r\nsurgeon went to have a conversation with the imprisoned midshipman, and\r\nby way of telling him something really worth hearing, let him know\r\nthat the captain had taken medicine and that it had done no good. Mr.\r\nBrookes, on hearing that physicians had so far been in vain, remarked\r\nthat if he could meet the captain on shore he would give him two pills\r\nthat should move him. Hereupon Mr. Donnidge rushed out, and finding the\r\ncaptain’s boat manned alongside, warned the crew to keep a good watch,\r\nfor he believed that their commander’s life was threatened. Something\r\nof Mackshane the toady surgeon in Smollett’s _Roderick Random_ seems to\r\nhang about Mr. Donnidge. Then there is another story of an anonymous\r\nletter found in the captain’s cabin, warning him that the lieutenant\r\nand the midshipman were plotting to raise a mutiny and run away with\r\nthe ship. The letter was either an impudent practical joke or another\r\ndevice of this remarkable naval captain’s, much on a level with the\r\nwound on his leg. The notes are but brief, and many clues were not\r\nfollowed up; but one ends with the conviction that the court martial\r\ncame to a sound and humane decision. It told Mr. Brookes that he had\r\nplainly been too free with his tongue, but that six months’ arrest\r\non the coast of Africa was quite punishment enough, and it dismissed\r\nthe captain’s rigmarole story of conspiracy to murder and mutiny as\r\nfrivolous and vexatious.\r\n\r\nThe name of Captain Moses may serve as connecting link to another tale\r\nof the sea life of that time. It was told in 1704 by an army officer of\r\nthe name of Colonel Luke Lillingston, in the course of a controversy\r\nwith Burchett, the Secretary of the Admiralty, and historian of the\r\nnaval wars of King William and Queen Anne.\r\n\r\nIn 1695 an expedition left England to harass the French West Indies.\r\nThe squadron was commanded by Captain Robert Wilmot, and the soldiers\r\nwere under the command of Colonel Lillingston. As a military operation\r\nit was of no importance, and its character has been sufficiently\r\ndescribed in the previous chapter. Our subject here is naval human\r\nnature as it was displayed towards the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury and remained for two generations. Lillingston had served as\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of Foulkes’s regiment in the expedition of Sir\r\nFrancis Wheeler in 1692, and had, he tells us, seen instances of\r\nthe “arbitrary behaviour” of naval officers. So extreme was this,\r\nand so much was it resented by military men that in 1695 they were\r\nmost reluctant to subject themselves to “the ill usage and insolent\r\nbehaviour of commanders at Sea, especially to officers of the army.”\r\nLillingston moved, he assures us, by a sense of duty, agreed to go\r\nwith Wilmot. A regiment was made up for him by drafts from others, and\r\nthe expedition sailed at the end of January. The naval commander, who\r\nas senior captain was called commodore, carried two women with him,\r\nin defiance of the regulations, and, so the soldier asserts, was on\r\nvarious occasions “pleased to be very drunk.” He touched at Madeira,\r\nand on the way there had the following conversation with Lillingston.\r\nThe men had not been on good terms, and we see clearly that the soldier\r\nexpected the sailor to be brutal, and was on the watch for instances of\r\n“arbitrary behaviour.”\r\n\r\n “He (_i.e._ Wilmot) told me he found I was a little strange to him,\r\n and [that he] should be glad we might understand one another better.\r\n I told him, I thought if there was any strangeness it was on his\r\n side, and as we had both promised His Majesty to maintain an entire\r\n confidence, and a friendly correspondence, it should not be my fault\r\n if we did not, and so offered, forgetting all that was past, to\r\n begin a more sociable agreement from that time, and so we drank to\r\n one another again. ‘But,’ says the Captain, ‘our agreement is very\r\n necessary on our own accounts, for if it be not our own faults we\r\n may both make our fortunes in this voyage, and provide for ourselves\r\n as long as we live.’ With all my heart said I, I shall endeavour not\r\n to be wanting to myself provided the King’s business be done too.\r\n ‘Damn the King’s business,’ says he, ‘we will do the King’s business,\r\n and our own too. But I’ll be free, with you,’ says the Captain, ‘I\r\n had the misfortune to kill a man (and I think named him) and it has\r\n almost ruined me, for it has cost me above a thousand pound, and I am\r\n resolved this voyage shall pay for it, and if you will join with me in\r\n such measures as I shall propose, this voyage shall make up all our\r\n losses.’”\r\n\r\nLillingston refused, and Wilmot went off in the sulks, growling:—\r\n\r\n “Well well” says he “if you don’t think fit to join with me you may\r\n let it alone, but I am resolved to make myself amends. I won’t go to\r\n the West Indies to learn the language. I’ll take care of myself, let\r\n the King’s business go how it will.”\r\n\r\nWhen the squadron reached Madeira, Wilmot endeavoured to get rid of\r\nthe military officers. He seized an opportunity to sail while most of\r\nthem were ashore buying provisions. A sudden gale was his pretext.\r\nFortunately his ships were scattered in a storm; one of them came\r\nback to Madeira, and the officers were picked up. At a council of\r\nthe officers of both arms, Wilmot had refused to allow Lillingston’s\r\ncaptain-lieutenant to sit, alleging that no officer under the rank of\r\ncaptain had a right to a seat. Now the captain-lieutenant, according\r\nto the military customs of the time, commanded what was counted as\r\nthe colonel’s company and ranked as the senior captain. Wilmot was\r\ninduced to see reason by the arguments of the commissary Murray; but\r\nLillingston, not unfairly, quotes his conduct as an example of pure\r\narbitrary insolence. He had turned the captain-lieutenant out of the\r\ncabin “with a rudeness that I had never seen among gentlemen.” At\r\nthe Leeward Islands Wilmot was again “pleased to be very drunk,” and\r\nwent the length of offering to give away commissions in Lillingston’s\r\nregiment. The military and naval elements came, in fact, to open\r\nquarrel. From the Leeward Islands this jarring expedition went on first\r\nto San Domingo, where some Spaniards, then our allies, joined us. There\r\nwas delay, wrangling, and an incessant conflict between soldier and\r\nsailor. Wilmot, says Lillingston,\r\n\r\n “loitered away six days in the Bay. During this time how his people\r\n were employed I know not, but as for himself he spent the time in\r\n diversions every day rowing about the bay in his barge with the\r\n Ladies, and attended by trumpets and all the music of the fleet in\r\n other boats to recreate himself and the women, with the pleasantness\r\n of the country.”\r\n\r\nWhen at last the expedition got to its work of plundering the French\r\nsettlements in Haiti, Captain Wilmot, who had been joined by various\r\nJamaica privateers, kept ahead of the troops as they marched along on\r\nshore, and applied himself to robbing the plantations, particularly of\r\ntheir negroes, who were then very valuable booty. At Port de Paix the\r\ncommodore made his last attempt to induce the colonel to come to an\r\nunderstanding for their common advantage:\r\n\r\n “But smiling he takes me by the hand and leading me aside he told\r\n me he wanted to speak with me, and now he showed himself in his own\r\n colours a second time and made his last attempt to bring me over to\r\n him; he told me he would comply with all the orders of our council of\r\n war, and assist me with all the men he could spare, and do everything\r\n he could to forward the service if I would but join with him in one\r\n thing, and allow a second. The first was I should consent to his\r\n having an equal share of the plunder with me in case the fort should\r\n be taken.\r\n\r\n “To this I made him no answer but asked him what was his second\r\n proposal. ‘Why,’ says he, ‘if you will join with me when the fort is\r\n taken and all done that can be done on the island we will carry these\r\n three Spanish men-of-war away with us to Jamaica, for,’ says he, ‘the\r\n dogs have got a great many of the negroes, and other plunder, and if\r\n you will consent,’ says he, ‘we’ll make them pay us well before we\r\n part with them.’ [Lillingston objected that this would be dishonest\r\n and would certainly get them into trouble at home.] ‘’Tis no matter\r\n for that,’ says the commodore, ‘we are a great way off England, and\r\n it may be long enough before the news of it will come there. We may\r\n make it worth our while and may easily make it up when we come home.’\r\n I told him I could not concern myself in such a thing unless the\r\n Spaniards gave us some just occasion. ‘Occasion,’ says he, ‘there is\r\n occasion enough, for they have got away our negroes, and it is easy\r\n enough to pick a hole in their coats on that account, and answer it at\r\n home.’”\r\n\r\nWilmot’s confidence that news took a long time to come home from the\r\nWest Indies, and that accusations were easily answered by people who\r\nhad money in their pockets, was not unfounded. Strange things happened\r\nin those waters. It may well have been within the commodore’s memory\r\nthat in the reign of Charles II. a man-of-war sent out to suppress the\r\nbuccaneers had gone over to them, after her captain had run his master\r\nthrough the body, and had then fled.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to dwell much more on this story. Port de Paix fell,\r\nand then the fever broke out among the sailors and soldiers, both the\r\nallies separated and returned to their own ports. Lillingston became\r\nvery ill, and while in bed, and as he thought dying, was pestered\r\nby several of the captains, William Moses being one of them, to\r\nsign certain papers which were meant, he supposed, to exculpate the\r\ncommodore. The military officer asserts that Wilmot stopped on the\r\nnorth side of Jamaica, and there sold the negroes he had plundered, for\r\ntwenty pounds a head, putting the money into his pocket. Lillingston\r\nremained ill in Jamaica, and the ships returned home by the Straits of\r\nFlorida. The fever went with them. One vessel was lost on the Florida\r\nshoals from want of men to handle her sails. Some of her crew were\r\nbrought off. Others were left to perish in the surf because they had\r\nbroken into the spirit-room, and were hopelessly drunk. Wilmot died\r\nof fever, and so did Captain Lance who succeeded him. The command\r\nfell to Captain Butler who brought the squadron home. In England\r\nthe commodore’s widow, Ruth Wilmot, accused Butler of having broken\r\ninto her husband’s desk, and of having stolen his plunder. A lawsuit\r\nfollowed which ruined both. In the course of the suit affidavits were\r\nproduced by both sides, and one of these, made on behalf of Captain\r\nButler, for the purpose of discrediting the witness of Ruth Wilmot,\r\ngives a curious picture of the discipline of the navy at that time. It\r\ndeals with the moral characters of one Theophilus Buxton and others.\r\n\r\n “Theophilus Buxton during such his employment (of steward to wit)\r\n was a person guilty of frequent drunkenness, abominable profaneness,\r\n execrable oaths, blasphemy, thieving and embezzlement, and the said\r\n Buxton and John Heath having, in one of their drunken fits at sea,\r\n set a candle on a jar of oil in the steward’s room next to the powder\r\n room, by which means the oil took fire, the said ship with all that\r\n was in her had in all probability been burnt or blown up had not the\r\n second lieutenant of the ship, with much difficulty and hazard, put\r\n out the fire, for which offence the said Buxton, and John Heath had\r\n about forty lashes apiece given them by order of Captain Butler, then\r\n commander of the said ship, and after the said Buxton came into the\r\n harbour he ran away from the said ship. And these deponents further\r\n say, that they likewise well know John Brinley, mariner in the said\r\n =Dunkirk=, who was a person very negligent of his duty, and very\r\n seditious, and at Portsmouth threatened his said Captain, and to kill\r\n one of the lieutenants of the said ship, and attempted to head the\r\n ship’s company in an open mutiny, and these deponents believe that\r\n the said Buxton, Heath, and Brinley are such profligate persons that\r\n they will swear anything that their malice and desire of revenge can\r\n dictate to them.”\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the navy captain, who was a mere brute,\r\nwas always a man of obscure birth. In August 1742 a court martial was\r\nheld at Spithead for the trial of an officer, who, if long descent,\r\nrank, and family connections were always, and not only as a rule,\r\nenough to form a gentleman, ought assuredly to have been one. This was\r\nthe Honourable William Hervey, third son of the first Earl of Bristol\r\nof the name. He had been captain of the =Superb=, 60, in the fleet\r\nwhich sailed for the West Indies under Sir Chaloner Ogle in 1740,\r\nand he was proved to the satisfaction of a court composed of brother\r\nofficers, and presided over by Admiral Cavendish, to have been guilty\r\nof conduct surpassing anything Smollett has described in his grim\r\npictures of the navy. His first and second lieutenants, the gunner\r\nand purser of his ship, swore that he beat an old seaman named White\r\nso brutally that the man was carried insensible to his hammock, and\r\ndied there accusing the captain of being the cause of his death; that\r\nhe often beat the quarter-masters from the wheel with a cudgel, and\r\nhad on one occasion actually endangered the ship in this way, during\r\na paroxysm of rage; that he once threw a paper under the table of his\r\ncabin, ordered a subordinate to pick it up, and kicked him while on his\r\nknees, to the peril of his life; that he injured his gunner seriously\r\nby a foul kick; that he thrashed his purser on the deck at Kinsale;\r\nthat he threatened to beat all his officers, “from the first lieutenant\r\nto the cook’s boy,” and that he not only abounded in abusive terms,\r\nbut enforced them by insulting gestures. Captain Hervey’s defence\r\nconsisted of the plea that he was never violent in word or action\r\nexcept when he was provoked, and in an unsupported counter-charge of\r\ncruelty to certain Spanish prisoners against his first lieutenant,\r\nwhich the court dismissed. It is consistent enough that while violent\r\ncaptains behaved with a brutality never heard of now except among the\r\nroughest and most ignorant class of the community, officers of weak\r\ncharacter had some difficulty in obtaining ordinary respect from their\r\nsubordinates. The discipline of the navy, in the highest sense of the\r\nword, was bad, though its mere drill might be sound. There was not as\r\nyet a standard of conduct, a prevailing spirit of honour to control and\r\ninspire all alike.\r\n\r\nMen with whom the loyal discharge of duty is not the first aim, want\r\nonly temptation and opportunity in order to disgrace themselves in the\r\nvery presence of the enemy. The charge of cowardice was frequently\r\nmade at this time. It was indeed one of the regular taunts brought\r\nagainst bad commanders. We may believe that in a sense it was often\r\nunjust. Brutal men are not seldom endowed with animal courage, and\r\ndo not always fail from mere fear. Indeed that weakness would hardly\r\nbe common among those who, by their own choice, followed a dangerous\r\nprofession. What, however, we might expect to discover among officers,\r\nwho agreed with Wilmot in the resolution to look after their own\r\nbusiness, and to make themselves easy for life, was a want of the\r\nsense of honour which feels a stain like a wound. They would easily be\r\nguilty of avoiding battle when no profit was to be expected, not out\r\nof pusillanimous tenderness for their personal safety, but because to\r\ntheir base minds there was no advantage to be secured by running risks.\r\nIf by any chance the cupidity which restrained them from obeying honour\r\nand duty was stirred to active malignity by hatred of a comrade or of\r\na superior, if, moreover, they were far away from home and might hope,\r\neven foolishly, to escape punishment, such persons would be capable\r\nof sinking to well-nigh any excess of baseness. By keeping these\r\nconditions in mind, we can understand that most shameful passage in the\r\nhistory of the Royal Navy, the betrayal of Benbow by his captains in\r\nAugust 1702.\r\n\r\nNot much is known of the early life of John Benbow, about whom some\r\nlegends have accumulated and who has a higher reputation than his\r\nrecorded services justify, partly perhaps because his name strikes\r\nthe ear, and partly because of his melancholy end. His origin is\r\nuncertain. That he was trained to the sea in the merchant service is\r\nknown. He served in a subordinate place in the navy for a time, and\r\nhe attracted the notice of James II. by making a manful defence of\r\nthe trading ship he commanded against a Barbary pirate. That he cut\r\noff the heads of his prisoners, put them into a bag with salt, and\r\ntumbled them out on the floor of the custom house at Cadiz may or may\r\nnot be true. It is a credible tale of one who assuredly was a thorough\r\nTarpaulin, and also it may well have been invented of such a man, or\r\ntransferred to him, from some older legendary sea hero. Common report\r\nsays that he had a rough tongue, and we may accept its testimony. The\r\n“gentlemen captains” of the time would no doubt have defined him as a\r\n“Wappineer Tar,” the abusive equivalent of Tarpaulin. His reputation\r\nmust have been good, for he was chosen to command a squadron in the\r\nWest Indies after the Peace of Ryswick, and was sent back again in\r\n1701 to intercept the Spanish plate ships which afterwards fell into\r\nour hands at Vigo. His movements are of little interest till August\r\n1702. In that month he sailed to intercept a French squadron commanded\r\nby M. du Casse on the Spanish Main. On the 19th he discovered his\r\nopponent with a squadron of ten ships, and immediately attacked with\r\nthe eight vessels he had with him. His line was formed in the usual\r\nway, his flagship, the =Breda=, being in the centre, and the others\r\nahead and astern of her. Two of his ships, the =Defiance=, Captain\r\nKirkby, and the =Windsor=, Captain Constable, fairly ran soon after\r\nthe action opened. If the French admiral had pushed his advantage\r\nhe must have destroyed Benbow’s squadron. But M. du Casse was on\r\ntreasure-carrying duty, and did not care to incur the hazard of having\r\nhis ships crippled. After doing some damage to the =Breda=, he drew off\r\nat night. Benbow now rearranged his line, putting the =Breda= at the\r\nhead, and placing the misbehaving ships, the =Defiance= and =Windsor=,\r\nimmediately behind her, in the hope of shaming their captains into some\r\nsense of honour. But example is wasted on men resolved to misbehave.\r\nFor four days the admiral followed the French, but his captains, with\r\nthe exception of the officer commanding the =Ruby=, Captain George\r\nWalton, took every opportunity to fall behind. On the fifth day of the\r\npursuit, and the sixth since he had got touch of the enemy, Benbow had\r\nhis ships together, and renewed the action. Again he was shamefully\r\nill supported. A cannon shot shattered his right leg. He had his cot\r\nbrought up on deck, summoned his captains on board the flagship, and\r\nmade a last appeal to their honour. Encouraged in all probability by\r\ntheir confidence that the wound would be mortal, and that they could\r\ntell the tale in their own way, the misbehaving captains insisted on\r\nreturning to Jamaica. Even the officers who had done their duty joined\r\nin recommending retreat, from a belief that their comrades would desert\r\nthem. The squadron went back to Jamaica, but though Benbow’s wound was\r\nmortal he lived long enough to do the Royal Navy one signal piece of\r\nservice. He brought his disloyal officers to a court martial. The heart\r\nof the navy was still sound in spite of the vices on the surface, and\r\nthe misconduct of these men had been too gross for pity. Sentences of\r\ndeath or dismissal were passed on all, and the offenders were sent\r\nhome for execution. Kirkby, and Wade of the =Greenwich=, were shot on\r\nboard the =Bristol= at Plymouth. Hudson of the =Pendennis= died before\r\ntrial, else he would have shared their fate. Constable of the =Windsor=\r\nwas dismissed the service, and imprisoned. Even the officers who had\r\nreluctantly joined in the recommendation to retreat were sentenced to\r\ndismissal, and were pardoned only by the intercession of the admiral.\r\nIt was said, apparently by way of palliation for Kirkby and Wade, that\r\nthey had behaved well before, and were less cowards than traitors.\r\nThere is probably this amount of force in the pitiful excuse, that they\r\nwere greedy men chiefly intent on pelf, who in their foolish cunning\r\nhoped to revenge themselves on their rough chief by ruining his chance\r\nof gaining glory. To end before a firing-party was their proper fate.\r\nIt has been the good fortune of the navy that the nation has always\r\nbeen very serious where it was concerned, and that in the worst of\r\ntimes there has always been within its own ranks the capacity to apply\r\nthe last indispensable sanction of the code of honour.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the great dim mass of seamen, whose fate so often\r\ndepended on the bad commander, is not easy to realise. But we have\r\nevery reason to believe that it was hard, even in comparison with\r\nthat of other sailors. The word is used here of all the elements\r\nforming the crews of our ships, though the “sailormen” to use\r\ntheir own expression—that is to say those bred from boyhood to the\r\nsea—never formed a majority, and even rarely amounted to a third of\r\nthe complements. The majority was always made up of soldiers and\r\nlandsmen. This proportion of one-third sailors and two-thirds landsmen\r\nwas enforced on the privateers. Taking the whole body of those who\r\nlived in the warships, and by the sea, they suffered from two standing\r\ngrievances throughout the whole of the eighteenth century,—the amount\r\nof their pay, and the system of payment. Though the establishment of\r\nWilliam III. doubled the pay of the officers, and the new establishment\r\nof 1700 did not make very material reductions, nothing was done for\r\nthe sailors. They continued to receive 20s. a month for a month of\r\ntwenty-eight days in the case of able seamen, and less for others. To\r\nthe true sailors this was peculiarly hard. The first effect of a war\r\nwas to send up the wages in merchant ships to 45s. and 50s. a month,\r\nwhile as much as £7 would be paid to the colliers for the voyage from\r\nthe Tyne to London, though it might last only six or seven weeks.\r\nIt was for this reason that the press was needed to man the navy.\r\nLandsmen, waisters, and marines were found with no great difficulty.\r\nNot being trained sailors they were not sought by shipowners. But the\r\nreal sailors were. Therefore it was necessary to draw them to the navy\r\nby offers of bounties to make up the bad pay of the state, and when\r\nthis temptation failed, as it invariably did, to attract a sufficient\r\nnumber, then to drive them in by the press.\r\n\r\nNor was the bad pay all, or even the worst. Their wretched 20s. or less\r\na month were paid to the men on a system both wasteful to the state and\r\ncruel to its servants. At home the payment was made by a commissioner\r\nwho went round with a staff of clerks, and held an inspection on each\r\nship. Then he held another, named a recall, in the dockyards, to take\r\nin the men overlooked, or absent during the first. The process was\r\nlong, and it led to an absurd outlay on travelling expenses and clerks’\r\nwages. Such as it was this system applied only to the ships at home.\r\nIt was long before the crews abroad, including the officers, were paid\r\ntill their return to England. If the men had remained always with the\r\nsame ship the evil, though severe enough, would not have been so great.\r\nBut they were shifted about from vessel to vessel, and had often to\r\npresent “pay tickets” for four or five different ships. In the later\r\nseventeenth century, before it became usual to maintain large squadrons\r\nabroad for years, the wrong was not so acutely felt. But in the\r\neighteenth it became a monstrous oppression. The discontent it caused,\r\nafter leading to many minor mutinies, culminated in the great outbreak\r\nof 1797. If the sailors had not been unorganised and unrepresented in\r\nParliament, and if it had been impossible to obtain them by force, a\r\nremedy must have been found earlier. A bad system has always indirect\r\nbad consequences, and one result of this was a sheer waste of public\r\nmoney. Funds voted for a given ship could not be paid till the proper\r\nclaimants appeared. Meanwhile the money lay in the hands of the\r\ntreasurer of the navy, who received the interest. If he left office he\r\nwas still responsible for the unclosed accounts, and the money remained\r\nwith him. It is even said that far into the eighteenth century the\r\naccounts of ships commissioned in the reign of Queen Anne had not been\r\nwound up. For the sailors themselves the system worked out in downright\r\nrobbery. When they could get their pay tickets they were driven to sell\r\nthem to speculators at enormous discounts. In order to protect them\r\nagainst this their tickets were kept in the hands of the captains—with\r\nthe result that they might never reach the proper owner. It was a\r\ncommon accusation against bad commanders that they robbed their men in\r\ncombination with the purser.\r\n\r\nOne practice of the old navy certainly lent itself to fraud. The\r\ncaptain was allowed four servants for each hundred of his ship’s\r\ncompany, and was accustomed to count this among the perquisites of\r\nhis office. Indeed the total of their wages is sometimes spoken of as\r\npart of his pay. A captain was fully entitled to employ men shipped on\r\nthese terms as servants, and he had a good claim to the patronage which\r\nthe power of selecting them gave him. He could for instance provide\r\nfor a son, or the son of a friend, by bringing him to sea, rating him\r\ncaptain’s servant, and training him to become an officer. Many of the\r\nbest of our chiefs, Nelson himself being one of them, served their\r\napprenticeship or part of it in this very way, and where the captain\r\nwas an honourable man who used his patronage on a high principle the\r\nstate was the gainer. The history of our navy in the last century shows\r\nthat a large proportion of our captains did use their privilege in\r\nthis spirit. But here there is no question of money profit. That could\r\nonly be got in two ways, of which the first was mean and the second\r\nfraudulent. A captain could take servants to sea, on the understanding\r\nthat he was to draw their pay, and give them what part he chose of\r\nthe ten pounds a year allowed for them by the state. He could also\r\nkeep false musters, that is, return boys or men as present when they\r\nwere not in the ship. This was an offence punishable by dismissal, but\r\nit was habitually committed. In its least criminal form it was done\r\nto allow a boy, who was still at school, to be borne on the books of\r\na ship in order to shorten the time he would have to serve at sea,\r\naccording to regulations before passing for lieutenant. A distinguished\r\nofficer who died in our own time, Sir Provo Wallis, had had his name on\r\nthe books of a ship for some years before he joined. At its worst it\r\nwas the offence of keeping false musters, pure and simple. The names\r\nof imaginary persons or of lads, who never meant to go to sea, were\r\nentered on the roll of the ship’s company, and their wages drawn by the\r\ncaptain. In the old slang phrase they were known as “Captain’s Hogs”\r\nand it is said that as many as thirty or forty of them drew pay in a\r\nsingle ship. At ten pounds a head this made a material addition to the\r\ncommander’s salary.\r\n\r\nBad pay, badly given, did not sum up the wrongs of the sailors. The\r\nconstant infliction of the lash was, as far as we can see, not felt as\r\nmore of a grievance by sailors than by schoolboys. But the bad food\r\nthey did resent, and there can be no doubt that the rations supplied\r\nwere frequently inferior, while the practice of putting six men on the\r\nallowance of four, in long voyages, caused the amount supplied to be\r\ninsufficient. It may be that the men did not realise how much the want\r\nof ventilation and the prevalence of dirt was against their interests.\r\nBut they suffered from them none the less. It must be repeated that the\r\nadministration did not sin from want of knowledge. There was a standing\r\norder to keep the ships properly aired. But a writer of the time,\r\nHenry Maydman in his _Sea Politics_, has explained why this regulation\r\nwas not applied. Captains frequently took the steerage, the space\r\nof the main-deck in front of their cabins, for themselves, forcing\r\nthe officers, who ought to have had it, further forward, so that the\r\nafter-hatchway was shut to the men. Thus only the fore-hatchway was\r\nleft to the crew, or for the purpose of establishing a draught. When\r\nthe ship was at sea, and the ports closed, the air below grew foul,\r\nand turned food and drink bad. It is to this we have to look for the\r\nexplanation of the frightful ravages of fevers during the cruises of\r\nthe time. A few weeks at sea even in European waters commonly made\r\nthe ships sickly. At the close of the century a long cruise at sea\r\nwas relied on to make them healthy. In the interval a great internal\r\nrevolution had been wrought in the navy, dating from about the end of\r\nthe War of the Austrian Succession, and carried on partly by Captain\r\nCook, partly by Dr. Gilbert Blane, who accompanied Rodney to the West\r\nIndies in 1782, but caused originally by the influence on the naval\r\nofficers of the great revival of intelligent humanity in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE TWO COLONIAL WARS\r\n\r\n AUTHORITIES.—Beatson, _Military Memoirs_; Campbell’s _Lives of the\r\n     Admirals_; Schomberg’s _Naval Chronology_; Burrows’ _Life of Hawke_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the signing of the Peace of Utrecht in 1713 till the beginning\r\nof the colonial war with Spain in 1739, the Royal Navy was used as\r\nan instrument in the hand of diplomacy to keep the peace, or as the\r\npolice of the seas. Europe was disturbed in the North by the last\r\nstages of the struggle between Peter the Great of Russia and Charles\r\nXII. of Sweden, in the South by the foolish ambitions of Philip V., the\r\nfirst Bourbon king of Spain, and his second wife, Elizabeth Farnese.\r\nBut the statesmen who controlled the policy of Western Europe during\r\nmost of these years, Sir Robert Walpole in England and Cardinal Fleury\r\nin France, were unwearied in warding off another war. Once, in 1718,\r\na strong fleet sent into the Mediterranean, to put a stop to one of\r\nthe Italian ventures of Philip V., destroyed a much weaker and very\r\nill-handled Spanish fleet off Cape Passaro, in Sicily. As a rule, the\r\nappearance of our ships was enough. Now and then an officer found some\r\nchance of distinction in service against the pirates, largely recruited\r\namong the privateers of the war, who swarmed in distant seas. The most\r\nsignal example was the suppression of a noted adventurer of this class,\r\nnamed Roberts, by Sir Chaloner Ogle, on the West Coast of Africa in\r\n1722. Meanwhile war on a vast scale was being prepared by two causes—on\r\nthe Continent by the rivalries of France and Austria in Germany, and\r\nSpain and Austria in Italy, together with the ambition of the rising\r\nkingdom of Prussia and its great King Frederick; and on the sea by the\r\ncollision of England with Spain and France in America, and with France\r\nin India. Great Britain was drawn into the Continental War by the\r\nHanoverian interests of the royal family and the desire to maintain the\r\nbalance of power. Here the navy played an indispensable but secondary\r\npart. But in the colonial struggle it was the foremost combatant, and\r\nexercised a decisive influence.\r\n\r\nA common interest drew France and Spain into alliance against us,\r\nbut the causes of hostility were various. As regards Spain, they go\r\nback to the reign of Charles II. From the time of our settlement in\r\nJamaica it had been our constant wish to secure the right of trading\r\nwith the Spanish colonies, while firmly refusing the Spaniards all\r\naccess to our own. The buccaneer wars, in so far as they were more\r\nthan plundering raids conducted by miscellaneous scoundrels, were\r\nthe attempts of private adventurers to carry out this policy. By\r\nthe Peace of Utrecht we secured the right to share in the trade of\r\nSpanish America. Agents were allowed to establish themselves at\r\nCarthagena on the Eastern, and Panama on the Western side. We secured\r\nan _asiento_, or contract for the supply of negroes. We were also\r\nauthorised to send one trading ship of 500 tons burden laden with\r\nmanufactured goods to the Spanish Main in each year. This arrangement\r\nled, as it was bound to lead, to much smuggling. As Spain revived,\r\nunder the more intelligent administration of the Bourbon dynasty,\r\nthe abuse of English treaty rights was resented. The Spaniards said\r\nthat the treaty ship was continually supplied with fresh goods by\r\ntenders, and complained that other smugglers haunted their coast, and\r\nwere guilty of many excesses. To protect themselves, they insisted\r\non searching English vessels found near their coast, and condemning\r\nthose they considered guilty, and Spanish adventurers retaliated by\r\npiracy. Hence arose a long angry conflict of claims and counter-claims\r\nbetween England and Spain, complicated by political disputes in Europe,\r\nand only prevented from ripening into war by the resolute peace\r\npolicy of Walpole. The Parliamentary Opposition, composed largely of\r\ndisappointed office-seekers, and, as they afterwards proved, incapable\r\nadministrators, took up the cause of the West India traders. There\r\nwas much general denunciation of the atrocities of the Spaniards. The\r\nbest known instance given was that of a certain John Jenkins, master\r\nof a trading vessel called the =Rebecca= of Glasgow. Jenkins asserted\r\nthat in 1730 his vessel had been boarded by a Spanish _guarda costa_,\r\nor revenue cutter, in the West Indies, and that the Spanish captain,\r\nwho is habitually described as “the infamous Fandino,” had cut his ear\r\noff. His vessel was undoubtedly searched near Havana, but was allowed\r\nto proceed on her voyage, and there is no evidence for the story that\r\nhis ear was cut off except his own word. As the country grew tired of\r\nthe long predominance of Walpole, and was worked into a pugnacious mood\r\nby the Patriots, use was made of Jenkins’s case to appeal to popular\r\nsentiment. A theatrical scene was arranged before a Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons, and the man was prompted to declare “that he had\r\nrecommended his soul to god, and his cause to his country” when he was\r\nsubject to the violence of Fandino. At last Walpole, seeing that the\r\ncountry was resolved on war, yielded, dishonestly, to what he believed\r\nto be a mistaken policy for the sake of keeping office. War with Spain\r\nwas declared in July 1739.\r\n\r\nThe Colonial quarrel with France arose in another way—and one more\r\nhonourable to us. The trade of her colonies was less worth striving for\r\nthan the Spanish, and she was too strong to be hectored. The aggression\r\ncame from her. In America her agents endeavoured to unite her\r\npossessions, in Canada and Louisiana, by annexing the valleys of the\r\nOhio and the Mississippi, which were first explored by her brilliant\r\nand daring adventurers. The result would have been to confine the\r\ngrowing British colonies between the Alleghanies and the Atlantic. In\r\nIndia the French Company was bankrupt. It endeavoured to gain the means\r\nof expelling its prosperous English rival, by acquiring political power\r\namong the native princes. For a time the Colonial conflict with France\r\nwas postponed by the great European war arising over the scramble for\r\nthe heritage of the house of Austria on the death of Charles VI. It was\r\nour exceeding good fortune that, when the decisive struggle for trade\r\ncolonies and supremacy at sea had to be fought out, the attention and\r\nthe resources of France were mainly employed on an attempt to acquire a\r\npredominant position in Central Europe.\r\n\r\nThis was the happier for us because years were to pass before we could\r\nafford to dispense with any of the help fortune gave us. Never was the\r\nGovernment of England less able than during the fag end of Walpole’s\r\nrule and the administration of the so-called Patriots. Never, save\r\nduring the last ignoble days of Charles II., was the navy less fit to\r\nmeet the calls of a great war. Its paper strength was indeed imposing.\r\nThere were 124 ships of the line—of from 100 to 50 guns each, and 104\r\nof lesser rates—that is, of 40 guns each or less. The total was 228,\r\nand it exceeded the united navies of France and Spain in everything\r\nexcept the quality of the individual ships. But it was suffering\r\nfrom the moral and intellectual diseases spoken of in the previous\r\nchapter. The long peace had afforded no opportunity of testing the\r\nquality of officers. In the earlier years its chiefs were worn-out and\r\ncommonplace, or brutal and noisy. All those years did for us was to\r\nbring forward the men who were to lead gloriously in after times. From\r\nthe point of view of the navy, the struggle waged under various names,\r\nthe Spanish War, the War of the Austrian Succession, and the Seven\r\nYears’ War from 1739 to 1763 with an eight years’ truce in the middle,\r\nwas one and the same war. Fortunately for us, if we were bad, our\r\nenemies were worse. Spain was languid, brainless, and could only fight\r\non the defensive. France was overtaxed, distracted by a multiplicity\r\nof aims, drifting to bankruptcy, corrupt at heart and frivolous. Great\r\nBritain was a mighty force, healthy, though afflicted by bad habits,\r\nbut capable of reform, and even at its worst advancing on sound lines.\r\nTherefore it could bear its administrative scum as a mighty river\r\ncarries driftwood and rubbish on its surface. This floating trash may\r\nmake a block and delay the current for a short space, but the moving\r\nwater flows below, and accumulates in irresistible pressure till one\r\nday it sweeps the obstruction out of its path.\r\n\r\nIn describing this struggle only a brief space need be given to the\r\nearly years, and in them what is best worth looking at is the promise\r\nof better times. Vernon in the West Indies and Mathews and Lestock in\r\nthe Mediterranean are the dominant figures of the first period—and\r\nthe types of all the navy had to succeed in shedding, or to perish.\r\nBeside them we see the gradual rise of Anson and Hawke, and with their\r\npredominance the triumph of the good over the bad.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish War, or War of Jenkins’s Ear as it came to be called when\r\nthe rage of the country was over, began by attacks on the possessions\r\nof Spain in the New World. A rigid blockade of our enemy’s ports at\r\nhome and invasion of his territory in Europe would have brought him to\r\nterms more effectually. But we had no sufficient army, and the navy,\r\nbesides being hardly yet fit for prolonged blockade in stormy seas,\r\nmuch preferred colonial expeditions rich in prize and plunder. To the\r\ncountry nothing seemed more likely to be effectual than the seizure of\r\nSpanish colonies—or more lucrative. During the long peace, in 1726,\r\n’27, a powerful fleet had been sent to blockade the port of Porto Bello\r\nfor the purpose of stopping the sailing of the treasure-ships, and so\r\ndepriving King Philip V. of the means of being mischievous in Europe.\r\nAdmiral Hozier who commanded, his successor, and many thousands of\r\nofficers and men died miserably of fever. The memory of this sacrifice\r\nto Walpole’s peace policy rankled, and an expedition to Porto Bello was\r\nsure to be popular. It was the port of lading for the treasure from\r\nthe South Seas, and the headquarters of the _guarda costas_ employed,\r\nas we said, to destroy our trade—but as the Spaniards put it, to stop\r\nour smuggling. An attack on it had been vehemently supported by the\r\nPatriots, and particularly by a sailor who was very conspicuous among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEdward Vernon had been a captain in the navy since 1706 and was the son\r\nof a Secretary of State. He owed his rapid rise to family influence,\r\nand no conspicuous service is recorded of him. During the peace he\r\nhad been for several years member for Ipswich, and had been among\r\nthe loudest-mouthed of those who first assailed the “profligate”\r\nadministration of Sir R. Walpole, and then imitated him in everything\r\nexcept his love of peace and his admirable finance. The navy now and\r\nthen produces a person who “has the gift of the gab ‘although’ he was\r\nbred to the sea,” and is continually playing the British seaman to the\r\ngallery. Vernon was the example of the type in his generation. He was\r\nas brave as any man, but too proud of what he ought to have taken for\r\ngranted. He was clever, but far too conscious of his cleverness. Withal\r\nhe was arrogant, had no control over his temper, and was afflicted with\r\nan insatiable vanity. Already he had boasted that he would take Porto\r\nBello with six ships. When the war began, he was sent with nine vessels\r\nto keep his promise. Vernon left in July 1739, and reached Jamaica late\r\nin October. On the 20th November he sailed into Porto Bello with six\r\nships, and took it almost without resistance. The fortifications were\r\nnot complete, nor were all the guns mounted. The garrison was crippled\r\nby tropical fever and was seized by a panic. They ran from their guns\r\nunder the fire of our ships, and the town was captured with less loss\r\nthan has often accompanied the taking of a sloop. Vernon behaved with\r\nhumanity when in possession of the place. This easy success threw the\r\nnation into a delirium of joy, and turned Vernon’s head completely.\r\nHe became convinced that all fortifications could be taken by merely\r\nrushing at them. In the position of unchecked authority he held in his\r\nown squadron, surrounded by men who deferred to him in obedient silence\r\neven when they did not toady him, his arrogance and self-assertion\r\nswelled till they grew to the proportions of mania. Vernon made an idle\r\ndemonstration off Carthagena on the 6th March 1740, but nothing else\r\nwas done.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the country was preparing to follow up the first success.\r\nAfter changes of plan, hesitations, and much administrative confusion,\r\nit was finally decided to make a double attack on Spanish America. A\r\nsmall squadron under Anson was to go round Cape Horn and range the\r\nwest coast of South America as far north as Panama, while a great\r\nexpedition carrying a body of troops under command of Lord Cathcart was\r\nto sail to the West Indies, join Vernon, and other troops drawn from\r\nthe British possessions in America, and then the whole was to fall on\r\nthe Spaniards. The actual point of attack was left to the discretion\r\nof the chiefs. Anson’s justly famous voyage may be left aside for the\r\npresent with the observation that as part of a combined operation it\r\nwas a failure through the delays shown in dispatching the expeditions.\r\nAccording to the original plan, Lord Cathcart was to have reached\r\nthe West Indies at the end of October 1740 under protection of six\r\nwarships. But the Government heard that the Spaniards were sending\r\nout a fleet. France was also beginning to move for the purpose of\r\nsupporting Spain. The Government delayed the expedition till a more\r\npowerful fleet could be collected. It left England under the care of\r\n25 warships commanded by Sir C. Ogle on 26th October, at which date it\r\nought to have been on the field of operations. On the 19th December\r\nit reached Dominica, where Lord Cathcart died, and was succeeded\r\nby General Wentworth. It was not at Jamaica till the 7th January.\r\nMeanwhile the enemy had not been idle. The attention of France, still\r\nnominally at peace with us, was drawn off by the death of the emperor\r\nand the opening of the Austrian Succession. Spain was left to her own\r\nresources, which, however, proved greater and were better handled than\r\nwe had expected. Don Rodrigo de Torres sailed on the 10th July, reached\r\nthe West Indies unmolested by us, sent part of his ships to reinforce\r\nCarthagena under Don Blas de Leso, and then went on, still unmolested\r\nby us, to Havana. It may be added that he finally brought the Spanish\r\ntrade home unseen, and even unsought by us.\r\n\r\nThe great English expedition reinforced by troops from the North\r\nAmerican colonies, and by negroes to do the work of the trenches, left\r\nJamaica by the 26th January 1741, and after some further hesitation was\r\nled against Carthagena. It reached its destination on the 4th March.\r\nThe town stands at the north end of lagoons, and can only be entered at\r\nthe western end by large ships at the Boca Chica, or Small Mouth. It\r\nwas not accessible from the sea front because of the shoal water and\r\nthe heavy surf. The Boca Chica was well fortified, and there were other\r\noutworks dotted along the lagoons. These had to be beaten down before\r\nthe body of the place, which was further defended by a strong outwork\r\ncalled the San Lazaro and a double wall, could be reached. From the\r\n9th to the 26th March we were fighting up along the lagoons with good\r\nsuccess. Vernon accused the military men of sloth and incompetence,\r\nand afterwards repeated his charges in a scolding pamphlet full of\r\nprovable misstatements of fact. At Carthagena he pestered his military\r\ncolleagues in a tone which revolted the pride of General Wentworth.\r\nStill, by the end of March we were close to the town, and on the 1st\r\nApril, a fatal date, Vernon dispatched a vessel to England with a\r\nreport of victory. It was soon followed by another with authentic\r\ntidings of disaster. The wet season begins at Carthagena at the end of\r\nMarch, and the troops were already very sickly. Their condition was\r\naggravated by the fact that the admiral seized the only supply of good\r\nwater for the fleet. At last Wentworth, who was plainly a weak man\r\nunfitted to contend with a bully, had the feebleness to allow himself\r\nto be badgered into making an attempt to storm the unbreached San\r\nLazaro, and was repulsed with frightful loss. Vernon made no use of his\r\nships against the town, though there was ample depth of water for them,\r\nas M. de Pointis had shown when he took the place in 1697.\r\n\r\nIt was now clear that Carthagena could not be taken without a regular\r\nsiege, an operation at that season, and with our resources, impossible.\r\nA council of war was held in the cabin of the flagship. The soldiers\r\nwhen asked what they proposed to do answered that they must first\r\nlearn what help they were to expect from the fleet. Vernon burst out\r\nin an explosion of abuse, and was firmly answered by Wentworth. Then\r\nhe flung out of the cabin in a fit of shrewish rage, and remained\r\nduring the rest of the council in the stern gallery, bawling occasional\r\ninterruptions. There could be but one end to the debate. The expedition\r\nretired with shame, and the odd hits, and the loss of several thousand\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nNor would there be any profit in going into the details of the war in\r\nthe West Indies. Few conflicts have ever been more insipid. Operations\r\nsimilar in purpose to this at Carthagena but on a smaller scale were\r\ncarried out by Vernon and Wentworth near St. Jago de Cuba in the autumn\r\nof 1741, and at Porto Bello in the spring of 1742. In 1743 a squadron\r\nunder Sir Charles Knowles was beaten off with severe loss in attack\r\non Puerto Cabello and La Guayra on the Main. Then the war died down\r\nto mere privateering for a time, to revive slightly towards the end.\r\nKnowles fought a moderately successful action with a Spanish force\r\nnear Havana in September 1748. But he was disliked by some of his\r\nofficers and accused of not doing enough, was tried by court martial,\r\nand reprimanded. A feud arose among his officers, who fought it out in\r\nduels. The West Indies in this war were destined to give us no glory,\r\nand very doubtful profit. The honour of the flag was deeply stained by\r\nCaptain Cornelius Mitchell, who while in command of a superior English\r\nforce showed mere cowardice in the presence of the French in August\r\n1746. For this he was only dismissed the service by a very weak court\r\nmartial. Some good did, however, come to the navy and the country from\r\nthis scandal. In 1749, after the conclusion of the war, it helped to\r\npersuade Parliament to revise the Naval Discipline Act of Charles II.\r\nThe rest of the war in the West Indies deserves no further notice.\r\nThe Spaniards avoided battle except on the one occasion named, and\r\napplied themselves to bringing home their trade, with fair success.\r\nThe French were too overtaxed elsewhere to appear in force. We not\r\nbeing put on our mettle, drowsed on in sloth, quarrels, and scandals.\r\nOn both sides the privateers were active. Throughout the course of the\r\nwar we took from the Spaniards 1249 ships, and they from us 1360. Our\r\nprizes included several treasure-ships, and were the more valuable. To\r\nconclude this side of the subject, it may be added that after France\r\njoined in the war against us we took from her 2185 ships, and she from\r\nus 1878. The balance in our favour was therefore 196.\r\n\r\nHere also may be put what remains to be said of Vernon. It is to\r\nthe honour of a man of whom little good can be told, that if he\r\nwas insolent to colleagues and harsh to his officers, he showed an\r\nintelligent humanity to his crews. He reduced the excessive allowance\r\nof rum given to men in the West Indies, and introduced the custom of\r\ndiluting it with water. The mixture is said by tradition to have got\r\nits name of “grog” from his nickname of “Old Grog,” given him for his\r\npractice of wearing a grogram boat-cloak. This is the only kindly\r\ntrait (for we cannot praise him for not behaving like a buccaneer at\r\nPorto Bello) in an unamiable character. Vernon had offered to resign\r\nafter the failure at Carthagena, but was flattered into remaining by\r\nministers who were unwilling to see him among them till his tar-barrel\r\npopularity had waned, as they no doubt began to see it would soon do.\r\nHe did return at the close of 1742. In 1744 his name was passed over\r\nin a promotion of admirals, and he resented the slight in a letter of\r\nincredible insolence to the Board. Yet in April 1745 he was promoted\r\nAdmiral of the White, and appointed to a home command during the\r\nJacobite rising. On service he began a course of violent wrangling\r\nwith the Admiralty, and finally threw up his post in a pet. Then he\r\nappealed to the public in anonymous pamphlets with clap-trap titles,\r\nconsisting largely of official letters which he had clearly no right\r\nto publish. When called to account for what was at the best a gross\r\nirregularity, he refused to acknowledge his responsibility, and was,\r\nby the king’s orders, struck off the list of admirals. He died on his\r\nestate at Nacton, in Suffolk, on the 30th October 1757, forgotten and\r\nobscure—an example of the worthlessness of mob popularity.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a pleasure to turn from this story of loud talk and little\r\nperformance to Anson’s immortal voyage. Not that it was without dark\r\nshades and disasters, not only because it ended in triumph, but because\r\nthere was at the head of it a hero, and round him a band fit to follow\r\na hero. Of Anson himself it may be said that in him English manhood\r\ngave itself a witness amid the vulgar crowd of Vernons, Knowleses,\r\nMitchells, Mathews, and Lestocks. Stern but just, asking for no\r\naffection, but deserving it, and commanding absolute confidence, he was\r\nindeed “the flower and pattern of all bold mariners ... unchangeable\r\nof purpose, crafty of counsel, and swift of execution; in triumph most\r\nsober, in failure ... of endurance beyond mortal man.”\r\n\r\nIt had at first been intended to send two expeditions to the South\r\nSeas, one under Anson to Manila, and another under Captain Cornwall\r\nround the Horn. But the Government changed its mind. Anson alone\r\nsailed, and was directed not on Manila but on Panama. There was delay,\r\nas always at that time, and the squadron did not leave England till the\r\n18th September 1740. It consisted of six ships:—\r\n\r\n +--------------+-------+-------+--------------------------+\r\n |              | Guns. |  Men. |                          |\r\n |              +-------+-------+                          |\r\n | =Centurion=  |  60   |  400  | George Anson, commodore. |\r\n | =Gloucester= |  50   |  300  | Richard Norris.          |\r\n | =Severn=     |  50   |  300  | Honourable Edward Legge. |\r\n | =Pearl=      |  40   |  250  | M. Mitchell.             |\r\n | =Wager=      |  28   |  160  | Dandy Kidd.              |\r\n | =Trial=      |   8   |  100  | Honourable G. Murray.    |\r\n +--------------+-------+-------+--------------------------+\r\n\r\nThere were two victuallers, transports to carry stores—the =Anna= and\r\n=Industry=. The squadron was fairly provided, but was hampered by a\r\nnumber of so-called soldiers who were in fact Chelsea pensioners,\r\nsent on board in disregard of Anson’s protest. All who could walk\r\ndeserted. The others died before the ships entered the Pacific; among\r\nthem it is said that there was a veteran who had fought at the Boyne\r\nfor King William. On the 25th October the squadron was at Madeira, and\r\nit reached St. Catherine, in Southern Brazil, on the 21st November.\r\nAlready the scurvy had broken out, and Anson stopped to restore the\r\nhealth of his crews till the 18th January 1741. From St. Catherine\r\nthe squadron fought its way South through storms to Port St. Julian,\r\nfamous in the voyages of Magellan and of Drake. From thence it went\r\non to the Pacific by the Straits of Le Maire and the Horn. It was a\r\nless dangerous route than the Straits of Magellan, but the incessant\r\ntempest made it perilous. Through one unbroken fury of wind and wave\r\nthe squadron struggled on to the Pacific, but all did not reach it.\r\nThe navigation of the time was rude, there were no chronometers, no\r\nmeans of finding the longitude. Two of the ships of the squadron, the\r\n=Severn= and the =Pearl=, came up on the wrong side of South America,\r\nand returned to England. Of the others the =Wager= rounded the Horn,\r\nbut was wrecked in the Golfo de Peñas. Anson did not reach Juan\r\nFernandez, the island of Robinson Crusoe, or at least of his original\r\nAlexander Selkirk, till 10th June, with his crew reduced to a mere\r\nhandful by scurvy. The =Trial=, the =Gloucester=, and the =Anna= came\r\nin one after the other. The last was broken up, and her crew taken into\r\nthe other vessels. It was September before the crews were sufficiently\r\nrevived for service. During the last months of 1741 and the first of\r\n1742, Anson remained on the coast taking prizes and capturing Paita.\r\nThe =Trial= was condemned. His squadron was too weak to effect anything\r\nagainst Panama, and he missed the heavily laden ship, which came yearly\r\nfrom the Philippines to Acapulco, in Mexico. On the 28th April he left\r\nthe American coast and stretched across the Pacific. Storms and scurvy\r\nraged round him again, and the =Gloucester= had to be sacrificed. The\r\n=Centurion= now alone remained. With her, Anson reached Canton, 21st\r\nNovember 1742, where he refitted. Then he took the sea once more\r\nto look for the Manila treasure-ship. On the 20th June 1743 he met\r\nand captured the _Nuestra Señora de Covadonga_, a prize of immense\r\nvalue, off Cape Espiritu Santo, in the Philippines. As a feat of war\r\nthe achievement was naught, for the Spaniard had most of his guns\r\ndismounted, and fought at hopeless disadvantage. Anson’s greatness\r\ncomes from this—that he conquered so much to be there at all. He\r\nreturned with his prize to Canton, sailed for home on the 15th October\r\n1743, and reached Spithead on the 15th June 1744.\r\n\r\nThe naval operations carried out against Spain in Europe were in\r\nthemselves insignificant, and are only worth noticing because they led\r\nto war with France. The actual declaration of war was not made till\r\n1744, by France on the 20th March, by England on the 31st, but it was\r\na pure formality. Conflicts had already taken place on the sea between\r\nthe ships of the two nations; the battle of Dettingen, in which English\r\ntroops took part as allies of Maria Teresa, had been fought, and an\r\nattempt had been made to cover an invasion of England in the interests\r\nof the Jacobites. France was openly giving moral and material support\r\nto Spain before actually joining her. While the great expedition to\r\nthe West Indies was preparing, Sir John Balchen was dispatched to the\r\nSpanish coast with a small squadron. It was characteristic of our\r\nhalf-hearted way of conducting the war that he was ordered out only to\r\ncapture the treasure-ships. They, however, were warned in time, and so\r\ncame safe home to Santander. Balchen was in some danger of falling in\r\nwith a much superior force sent out by the Spaniards to look for him,\r\nand returned having effected nothing. Meanwhile Haddock was watching\r\nCadiz, not so vigilantly, however, but that a Spanish squadron got away\r\nunimpeached by us, and reached Ferrol. The Spanish Government collected\r\ntroops on the east coast as if to threaten Minorca, and on the north\r\nas if in preparation for an invasion of England, to be supported, it\r\nwas hoped, by help from the Jacobites. The apparent danger of Minorca\r\ndistracted Haddock, who was even short-handed till reinforced by a\r\nsquadron under Lestock. At home a powerful force was collected under\r\nSir John Norris to repel the threatened invasion. He sailed twice to\r\nwatch Ferrol, but was driven back by storms in July and August. When\r\n1740 ended, we had certainly done nothing proportionate to our immense\r\nnumerical superiority. The Spanish fleets lay quiet in port, or slipped\r\naway to the West Indies, and the Basque privateers were active even in\r\nthe Channel. In 1741 there was no change. Sir John Norris was again at\r\nsea in the Channel and Bay of Biscay, but to little purpose. Haddock,\r\nwith his fleet reinforced by Rear-Admiral Lestock, continued to watch\r\nDon José Navarro at Cadiz. In December the English fleet had become\r\nvery foul, and was compelled to go into Gibraltar and clean. Navarro\r\nat once put to sea, and entered the Mediterranean. Meanwhile a French\r\nfleet under M. de Court had left Toulon, and advanced south along the\r\ncoast of Spain. So soon as he knew that the Spaniards had passed him,\r\nHaddock started in pursuit, but only came up in time to see the French\r\nand Spanish fleets join, and to find himself in the presence of a very\r\nsuperior force. It was notorious that M. de Court would support Navarro\r\nif attacked, but since France was still endeavouring to make war and\r\nkeep peace at one and the same time, he would not attack us. Haddock\r\nwas allowed to go on to Minorca. The allies covered the passage of some\r\nSpanish troops to Italy, and then went into Toulon. Here they remained\r\ntill February 1744. Haddock, old and worn-out, resigned his command to\r\nLestock at the close of 1741. In May 1742 Admiral Mathews came out with\r\na commission not only to command the fleet but to be Minister at the\r\ncourt of Sardinia. It would have been difficult to make a worse choice.\r\nHe was stupid, boorish, illiterate, and of a violent temper, which\r\nearned him in Italy the nickname of “Il Furibondo.” Moreover, he had\r\na long-standing quarrel with Lestock, and had asked that this officer\r\nmight be recalled. The Ministry did not consent, and Mathews revenged\r\nhimself by coarse insolence to his subordinate. A proud man would have\r\nsought his own recall; but Lestock was only sulky and malignant.\r\n\r\nDuring 1742 some service was done. In June a squadron of Spanish\r\ngalleys was burnt at St. Tropez by fireships under the command of\r\nCaptain Callis, who earned the last gold collar and badge given for\r\nthis kind of service. In August a detached squadron under Captain\r\nMartin forced the Bourbon king of the Two Sicilies to withdraw the\r\ntroops he had sent to serve against our ally the Queen of Hungary by\r\nthreatening to bombard Naples. With these exceptions, 1742 and 1743\r\nwore away, while Mathews was mostly at Turin, and his fleet lay at\r\nanchor without practice at sea. Some acts of violence on the coast\r\nof Italy are recorded against our captains. The British Minister\r\nat Florence, Sir Horace Mann, who looked upon them, with the sole\r\nexception of Captain Temple West, as “genteel porpoises,” asserts that\r\nwhen some of our men robbed a church of a cross and of the sacrament,\r\nMathews hung the cross round the neck of his pet monkey, and stuck the\r\nconsecrated wafer on the beast’s forehead. The tardy determination of\r\nFrance to take an active part on the sea gave a stimulus to the war in\r\nthe early days of 1744.\r\n\r\nIn this year she acted with some vigour both in the Channel and in\r\nthe Mediterranean. At the close of 1743 troops had been collected\r\nat Dunkirk for an invasion again, in the hope of causing a Jacobite\r\nrebellion. A fleet of twenty-four sail was armed at Brest, and put\r\nunder the command of M. de Roquefeuil. He sailed at the end of January,\r\nwas off the Eddystone on the 3rd February 1744, and had come as high as\r\nDungeness by the 24th. The peril served for a moment to calm the feuds\r\nof the politicians, for the country was terribly frightened. English\r\nsoldiers and foreign mercenaries were called in from abroad, and we\r\napplied to the Dutch for the contingent they were bound to supply by\r\ntreaty. A fleet was collected under Sir John Norris in the Downs, and a\r\nbattle seemed inevitable. But a succession of heavy gales from the east\r\nand north-east drove the French out of the Channel back to Brest, and\r\nthe peril passed away.\r\n\r\nWhile the wind and the inefficiency of the enemy were standing\r\nour friends in the Channel, a transaction was taking place in the\r\nMediterranean which did us little honour and was the beginning of\r\ninfinite bitterness. It was known by the end of 1743 that France was\r\ncoming actively into the naval war. In January 1744 Mathews came\r\ndown from Turin, where he had been acting as Minister, and resumed\r\nhis functions of admiral. His fleet was at anchor in the roadstead\r\nof Hyères, between the mainland and the islands of Porquerolles, and\r\nthere it remained till M. de Court and Don José Navarro put to sea\r\nfrom Toulon on the 19th February. It consisted of twenty ships of\r\nthe line when he rejoined it, but was raised by reinforcements to\r\ntwenty-nine. The allies numbered twenty-eight, twelve of them being\r\nSpaniards. One of the Spanish ships, the _Real Felipe_, carried 116\r\nguns, and her fellows were fine ships. The French were somewhat\r\ninferior, and the weight of metal as well as of numbers was in favour\r\nof Mathews, but the battle which followed was a disgrace alike to the\r\ndiscipline, the intelligence, and, with a few exceptions, even to the\r\nmanhood of the navy.\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy was known to be at sea, we struggled out from Hyères,\r\nfoul from long lying at anchor, and clumsy from want of practice.\r\nThe code of signals, too, was arbitrary and poor. The same signal\r\nwas found both in the fighting and the sailing orders, and meant\r\ndifferent things in each. During the 10th February and the night of the\r\n10th-11th Mathews’ fleet struggled towards the enemy in light breezes\r\nand baffling currents. On the morning of the 11th it had got between\r\nthe enemy and Toulon. The van under Admiral Rowley and the centre\r\nwhere Mathews was himself, were in a position to force a battle on the\r\nallies, who lay in a line to the south and west of them, heading to\r\nthe west with the French in the van and centre, and the Spaniards in\r\nthe rear, and therefore nearest us. But the English rear under Lestock\r\nhad drifted apart in the night, and was five miles astern. In the\r\nlight breezes it could not come up in time to be of use. Yet Admiral\r\nMathews decided to give battle. We bore down at one in the afternoon,\r\nso that the English van came into action with the French centre, and\r\nthe English centre with the Spanish ships behind M. de Court. If the\r\nbreezes had been stronger, or the French more alert, their van might\r\nhave doubled back, and have put our leading ships between two fires.\r\nThey did not, and Admiral Rowley maintained a lively cannonade with\r\nM. de Court till the French admiral turned in the evening to help the\r\nSpaniards, whom he believed to be hard pressed. At that part of the\r\nline there had been not only failure but shame. Admiral Mathews brought\r\nthe Spaniards to an action. He would have made it close had several\r\nof his captains not been “shy.” He himself in the =Namur= showed the\r\ncourage which is the redeeming quality of his type, and stood out of\r\nhis line with the signal for the line still flying in order to come\r\ncloser to the enemy. Captain Cornwall of the =Marlborough= fought the\r\ngreat _Real Felipe_ nobly, being himself mortally wounded, and his\r\nship cut to pieces. Captain Edward Hawke in the =Berwick= set a fine\r\nexample, and compelled the Spanish _Poder_ to strike. But with these\r\nexceptions nobody did brilliantly and several captains showed what, if\r\nit was not actual cowardice, was the kind of confusion and stupidity\r\nwhich keep a man well away from the enemy. These “cankers of a long\r\npeace” proved once more that a loud voice, a blustering manner, and a\r\nparade of brutality are no guarantees of courage. A notable feature\r\nof the battle was that it gives the last example of the old practice\r\nof using a fireship in action. One was sent down to burn the _Real\r\nFelipe_, but the result showed the limitations of this old-fashioned\r\nweapon. She was reduced to a sinking state by the well-directed fire\r\nof the Spaniard, who also sent out a boat to tow her clear. It was\r\nperhaps fortunate for us that she was shattered by an explosion, and\r\nwent down, since the enemy might possibly have turned her against the\r\n=Marlborough=, then lying crippled where she had pushed in among their\r\nown ships. Night and the confusion of both sides ended the battle, but\r\nthe allies had suffered some rough handling, and were chiefly intent on\r\nretreat. Mathews might well have renewed the action when he was at last\r\njoined by Lestock. He came, however, to the strange conclusion that\r\nhe could not follow the enemy, because it was his duty to protect the\r\ncoast of our allies in Italy—though it would surely have taxed a less\r\ntorpid intellect than his to say what that coast was to be protected\r\nagainst, unless it were the very fleet he was refusing to pursue. The\r\nenemy was actually allowed to recover the _Poder_, which he abandoned,\r\nand to retire unmolested to Carthagena. The _Poder_ was then burnt by\r\nus. Mathews returned to Mahon, where he solaced his feelings by putting\r\nAdmiral Lestock under arrest.\r\n\r\nThe failure off Toulon, coming as it did after a long succession of\r\nrepulses in the West Indies, and futilities in Europe where nothing\r\neffectual had been done to intercept the Spanish fleets, stirred the\r\ncountry to deep anger. The news came slowly, and it was not until\r\nLestock had returned under arrest, and Mathews had resigned and had\r\ncome home, that their recriminations began to bring out the whole\r\ntruth. Parliament took the matter up, and carried out a preliminary\r\ninquiry during April and March of 1745. Lestock and others were heard\r\nat the bar, and Mathews, who was a member, in his place. The debate\r\nleft him, according to Horace Walpole, “in the light of a hot, brave,\r\nimperious, dull, confused fellow,” and it also left the House persuaded\r\nthat a court martial must be held on the whole battle. On the 18th\r\nof April, the Commons with their Speaker waited on the king at St.\r\nJames’s Palace with a petition that a “court martial may be held in the\r\nmost speedy and solemn manner, to inquire into the conduct of Admiral\r\nMathews, Vice-Admiral Lestock, Captains Burrish, Norris, Ambrose,\r\nFrogmore, and Dilk,” together with that of the lieutenants of the\r\n=Dorsetshire=, who were accused of misleading their captain, Burrish.\r\nThe king granted the petition. The measure was somewhat irregular, and\r\nmight be represented as trenching on the rights of the Admiralty,—it\r\nwas so considered by Anson who was now on the Board,—but the case was\r\nexceptional, and it was by no means certain that the Admiralty would\r\nhave acted if Parliament had not applied firm pressure. The action\r\nit took is one more reminder that, in the dullest times, the country\r\nhas always been in earnest about its navy. It may, as Sir Charles\r\nPasley has said, have played with the army, which it long regarded\r\nwith jealous distrust and dislike, but where the navy was concerned\r\nit knew that its very existence was at stake. Therefore, though\r\ntolerant of much corruption in the naval, as in other branches of the\r\nadministration, it was roused to wrath, and the resolve to have the\r\nwhole truth out, by any failure on the sea.\r\n\r\nA court martial, consisting of no less than twenty-four members, and\r\npresided over by Sir Chaloner Ogle, began to sit on the 11th September\r\n1745. First it tried the four lieutenants of the =Dorsetshire=, whom\r\ntheir captain had accused in order to clear himself, and acquitted\r\nthem. Then it tried Captain Burrish, and condemned him to be cashiered.\r\nCaptain E. Williams of the =Royal Oak= was next tried and condemned,\r\nbut with less severity on the ground that he was old and nearly blind.\r\nCaptain John Ambrose of the =Rupert=, who had shown courage and zeal\r\nin single ship actions, was yet condemned for misconduct at Toulon,\r\nand sentenced to be cashiered during the king’s pleasure. He was\r\nrestored in rank, but never again employed, and died a superannuated\r\nrear-admiral. Captain Dilk of the =Chichester= shared his fate. Captain\r\nFrogmore of the =Boyne= died before the trial. Captain Norris of the\r\n=Essex= did not dare to face a court martial. He fled into Spain from\r\nGibraltar, and was never heard of more. Five supplementary trials\r\nwere held on Captains Pelt, Sclater, Temple West, Cooper, and Lloyd.\r\nThe last three named were sentenced to be cashiered, but the finding\r\nwas generally considered unjust, and all three were restored. The\r\nsentence of the court in this case is worth noting. Temple West and\r\nhis colleagues had been stationed in the van with Admiral Rowley, and\r\nhad taken steps to prevent the French ships, which stretched ahead of\r\nour line, from doubling back and putting us between two fires. It is\r\ndoubtful whether the enemy had any such design, though his movements\r\nseemed to show that he had, and the counter-measures of these captains\r\nwere correct. But they had acted without the express orders of their\r\nsuperior. They were therefore to be punished, not for doing what was\r\nwrong, but for doing what was right without orders. Observe that the\r\npunishment inflicted on them for what at the worst was a pardonable,\r\neven an honourable error of judgment, was identical with the penalty\r\nimposed on Captain Burrish, who showed the white feather. We have to\r\ncome to the conclusion that, according to the principles of a court\r\nmartial at that time, it was better that an English fleet should be\r\ndefeated than that an officer should disregard an order no longer\r\napplicable to the circumstances, or act with independent intelligence.\r\nIf this rule had continued to prevail, Nelson would have been cashiered\r\nfor his bold move at St. Vincent.\r\n\r\nThat some such rule did prevail in their dim minds is indeed obvious\r\nfrom the result of the two great trials which followed on these small\r\nones. Vice-Admiral Lestock was tried in May 1746, and honourably\r\nacquitted. The charges against him were, in substance, that on the\r\nnight before the battle, when the signal to form the line was flying,\r\nthe admiral signalled the fleet to lie to for the night. At that moment\r\nAdmiral Lestock’s squadron was separated from the main body of the\r\nfleet. On any intelligent interpretation of the orders it is clear that\r\nLestock should first have joined the other ships, and should then have\r\nlain to with them. He preferred to lie to at once, and drifted still\r\nfarther apart in the night. Next day he was five or six miles astern.\r\nHe pleaded that he could not come up, and that as the signal for the\r\nline was flying he was bound to remain in a line even although that\r\nkept him out of the action. One thing is abundantly clear from his\r\ndefence, and it is that whenever he saw a conflict of orders Lestock\r\nhabitually preferred that one of the two which kept him away from his\r\nadmiral, and well out of reach of the enemy. In after times Rodney, who\r\nserved in this fleet before the battle, and who knew the men, recorded\r\non the margin of Clerk’s _Naval Tactics_ his firm conviction that\r\nLestock had betrayed his admiral. Rodney was headlong in his judgments,\r\nbut his is the voice of one seaman of that time judging another, and\r\nshows what charges were not thought incredible. Certain it is that\r\nLestock behaved like a man who was very glad of any excuse not to help\r\na superior whom he hated. Yet he was honourably acquitted.\r\n\r\nThere now remained nothing to be done but to try Admiral Mathews. He\r\nappeared before a court martial in June 1746—and was sentenced to\r\nbe cashiered. That he was a stupid man, and was equally unfit to be\r\na minister plenipotentiary or an admiral, is true. In giving up the\r\npursuit of the allies, and so losing his chance to renew the battle,\r\nhe showed extreme dulness and even want of spirit. But in the action\r\nhe had fought manfully, and if his example had been well followed the\r\nSpanish squadron would in all probability have been cut to pieces. His\r\ngreat sin in the opinion of the court was that he engaged in such a\r\nway as to make the maintenance of the line impossible while the signal\r\nto preserve it was flying. Again we have to arrive at the conclusion\r\nthat, from the point of view of the court martial, it was better that\r\nthe enemy should not be brought to action than that the line should be\r\ndisordered. Such a result could only have been reached by men who had\r\nnever spent an hour in thinking out the methods of fighting a battle to\r\nthe best purpose, but had simply accepted the sixteenth article of the\r\nFighting Orders with the docility of pedants. The consequence of their\r\nfinding was to rivet the tyranny of a pedantic rule so firmly that it\r\nrequired forty years of war, and an extraordinary combination of happy\r\ncircumstances at the end of them, to free the navy from its bonds.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these trials an incident took place which is of\r\ninterest, because it settled the question of the subordination of the\r\nmilitary to the civil courts. The President of the court martial formed\r\nto try Admiral Mathews was Perry Mayne, Rear-Admiral of the Blue. It\r\nhappened that Admiral Mayne had sat on a court martial in the West\r\nIndies to try a lieutenant of marines named Frye, and had sentenced\r\nhim to dismissal and imprisonment. Lieutenant Frye took proceedings\r\nagainst the members of the court in England for acting beyond their\r\npowers and for imprisoning him illegally. He gained his case, and £800\r\ndamages. In the course of these proceedings a writ was issued by Sir\r\nJohn Willes, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, against Perry Mayne and\r\nCaptain Rentoul, another of Mathews’ judges, who also had sat on the\r\ncourt martial. The other members of the court were extremely angry at\r\nthis interference with their President, and recorded a violent protest\r\nagainst the action of Sir John Willes, in which they were encouraged\r\nnot only by the king, who was a German prince, and very ignorant of\r\nEnglish ways to the end of his life, but by the Lords of the Admiralty\r\nand Corbet the Secretary, who ought to have known better. Sir John\r\nWilles at once asserted his authority by attaching all the members of\r\nthe court for contempt. They were compelled to present a very humble\r\nand public apology.\r\n\r\nWhile the failures of the chiefs who had risen during the long peace\r\nand their quarrels were filling the eyes and ears of the world, a great\r\nwork was beginning to be done for the Royal Navy, quietly and within\r\nthe walls of the Admiralty. It dated from December 1744, when Anson\r\nwas appointed as a member of the new Board, with the Duke of Bedford\r\nas head. The duke was an indolent, great noble, who served the state\r\nbecause public life was proper to a man of his rank. But he was honest\r\nand sincerely patriotic. Though too much accustomed to a splendid and\r\npleasure-seeking life to be a hard worker himself, he supported Anson\r\nsteadily. Other politicians, and notably the Duke of Newcastle, were\r\ntoo incapable, and too completely devoted to jobbery, to give any\r\nactive help, but self-interest made them understand that something\r\nmust be done for the navy. The country would not tolerate a repetition\r\nof the miscarriages of the early years of the war, and efforts must\r\nbe made to bring about an improvement, if the eminent persons engaged\r\nin the parliamentary, and court, scuffling of kites and crows, were\r\nto be safe in their lives and estates. A good method of securing this\r\ndesirable end was to obtain the services of a competent workman, and to\r\nlet him labour unhampered. No better help could have been found than\r\nAnson’s. The great seaman’s connection with the administrative work of\r\nthe navy began in 1744, and continued with brief interruptions till\r\nhis death in 1762. Until 1751 he served as a subordinate under Bedford\r\nand Bedford’s successor, the Earl of Sandwich, who both trusted him.\r\nAfter that date he was himself First Lord, almost continually. Anson\r\nwas not fitted to shine in the society of London. He could not shake\r\noff the silent retiring habits formed during long years of cruising\r\nin solitary command at a time when the chief was accustomed to keep\r\nall subordinates at an awful distance. He was proud and shy, a little\r\nhard too, and inclined to be grasping, as strenuous ambitious men\r\ncommonly are. It is therefore not surprising that he excited a good\r\ndeal of dislike, and laid himself open to the attacks of writers so\r\ndifferent, and so well able to make their voices heard, as Horace\r\nWalpole and Smollett. We, whose ambitions he has not disappointed, and\r\nwhose advances he did not snub, can judge him by another standard. We\r\ncan remember that if he took care of his own fortunes, he also worked\r\nhard to improve the quality of our shipbuilding, and, what was even\r\nmore important, to improve the quality of the senior ranks of the navy,\r\nwhile he did a great deal to promote inquiry into, and reform of, the\r\ncorruptions of the dockyards.\r\n\r\nSome years had to pass before the new spirit, hampered as it\r\nnecessarily was by inherited evils, could produce much effect. A glance\r\nat the operations of 1744 will show from what a low level of energy\r\nthe naval administration had to be raised. Though the retreat of M. de\r\nRoquefeuil before Sir John Norris and the February gales had shown the\r\nweakness of our enemy, we yet called upon the Dutch to send the twenty\r\nships they were bound to supply by treaty. These vessels were duly\r\nsent. Nothing effectual was done with the large force now collected.\r\nIn April and May Sir Charles Hardy with the Grand Fleet escorted the\r\nMediterranean trade as far south as Lisbon. The French, after the\r\nfailure of Roquefeuil’s cruise, had reverted to the plundering warfare\r\nof the former war. Fourteen vessels were sent out in twos and threes\r\nwith orders to join at sea and attack our commerce, under the command\r\nof M. de Rochambeau. Admiral Hardy protected the trade against his\r\nattacks till it was safe in the Portuguese ports, and then returned\r\nhome. The return voyage was marked by an incident which gives no high\r\nopinion either of the discipline of the fleet or of its intelligence.\r\nOn the 8th May a sail was seen to the northward, and Captain Watson\r\nof the =Northumberland=, 74, was ordered to chase, but not to lose\r\nsight of the fleet. He did lose sight. A mist came on, but a gun was\r\nheard by the officers on deck, Captain Watson himself being in his\r\ncabin, and was understood to be a signal of recall. The captain came\r\nup, but continued to hold on, although a second signal was reported by\r\nthe midshipman on the forecastle. In the afternoon the mist lifted,\r\nand the =Northumberland= was found to be close to two large French\r\nwarships, the _Content_, 60, and the _Mars_, 68, which had a frigate,\r\nthe _Venus_, 26, with them. At this time the =Northumberland= was not\r\ncleared for action, nor indeed was she ever in proper order throughout\r\nthe fight. The master, James Dixon, implored the captain to get his\r\nship into better condition, but no notice was taken. A midshipman\r\nnamed Best swore at the court martial that he heard the master say to\r\nthe chaplain that it was sad Captain Watson should take the ship into\r\naction in the condition he was in. When asked what he understood by\r\nthis, he answered that he supposed the master to mean that captain\r\n“was in liquor.” The evidence was not tested, though both the master\r\nand chaplain were present. Captain Watson’s actions were certainly\r\nnot those of a sober man. He bore down on the two Frenchmen, passing\r\nthe _Content_, which was nearest and engaging the _Mars_, whereby he\r\nenabled both to fall on him at once. The =Northumberland= was cut to\r\npieces. Captain Watson received first one wound and then a second.\r\nHe staggered to the accommodation ladder, and stood holding to the\r\nrailing and bleeding to death. The master, it was sworn, came on the\r\nquarter-deck “with his hands in his breeches and his hat on, seemingly\r\nin a surly mood.” He declared that there were no men to fight the ship,\r\nand indeed the crew were running from the guns, while all the marines\r\non the poop who were not shot had escaped below. In these conditions\r\nthe flag was hauled down. The master gave the command after appealing\r\nto the captain to surrender, in order to save the men from being killed\r\n“like cows.” The first lieutenant, Craven, made a motion to hoist it up\r\nagain, and even spoke of blowing the ship up rather than surrender her\r\nto the enemy. But his heroism did not go beyond words, and indeed the\r\n=Northumberland= was in no condition to fight further. Yet he was the\r\nsuperior officer, and, if he had wished to repeat the heroism of Sir\r\nRichard Grenville, had all the necessary authority. The court martial\r\nacquitted the lieutenant honourably, but sentenced the master to\r\nimprisonment for life in the Marshalsea. It would have sentenced him to\r\ndeath, but took the more merciful course in consideration of the good\r\nadvice he gave the captain, which, if it had been followed, would have\r\nprevented the loss of the ship.\r\n\r\nHere, by way of illustration, may be taken the case of another vessel,\r\nlost in the following year. This was the =Anglesea=, 40, commanded by\r\nCaptain Elton. She was cruising on the south coast of Ireland, and fell\r\nin, off the Old Head of Kinsale, with the _Apollo_, a French privateer\r\nof 56 guns. Captain Elton rushed into action with all the folly of\r\nCaptain Watson. His decks were not cleared, nor his men properly at\r\nquarters. The gunner could not as much as get the key of the powder\r\nmagazine till the last moment. So ill did Captain Elton handle his\r\nship that he allowed the Frenchman, who was to windward, to cross his\r\nstern, rake him, and range up on the lee side. As the =Anglesea= was\r\none of the crank ships then common in our navy, she heeled over so\r\nmuch that the water ran in at her ports. Thus she lay, with her upper\r\ndeck exposed to the small-arm fire of the Frenchman, her hull and\r\nrigging at the mercy of a heavier broadside than her own. In twenty\r\nminutes she was a beaten ship. Captain Elton fell, shot through the\r\nbody. Two of his men took him down to the surgeon, but on reaching\r\nthe main-deck from the quarter-deck found he was dead, and so left\r\nhim. The ship was surrendered by Lieutenant Baker Philipps. The court\r\nmartial found that the chief cause of the loss of the vessel was the\r\nnegligent and unofficerlike conduct of Captain Elton. Yet it sentenced\r\nPhilipps to be shot, though with a recommendation to mercy in which all\r\njoined except the President. Baker Philipps was shot. Admiral Vernon\r\nafterwards quoted this as a proof that naval courts martial did their\r\nduty. The shocking contrast between the cruel severity shown to this\r\nyoung officer and the scandalously light sentences passed on greater\r\noffenders, had probably not a little to do with making Parliament see\r\nthat the naval court martial had to be taken in hand.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Hardy’s own work was half done. He returned home, leaving\r\nM. de Rochambeau at sea. The Frenchman blockaded the merchant ships\r\nin Lisbon. Among them were vessels on their way out with stores for\r\nthe garrisons and ships in the Mediterranean. The necessity for\r\naction was pressing, and a fleet was sent out. It is a proof of the\r\nlittle confidence felt in the senior officers of the day that the\r\nwork was entrusted to Sir John Balchen, a veteran of the wars of King\r\nWilliam and Queen Anne, who had fought some forty years before as\r\ncaptain against Duguay-Trouin with more courage than success, and had\r\nlately been appointed Governor of Greenwich Hospital as a reward for\r\nlong service. In spite of his great age (he was seventy-five), and\r\nhis claim to exemption, Balchen left his well-earned rest, and took\r\ncommand of the fleet. He drove off Rochambeau, saw the trade safe to\r\nGibraltar, and returned home in September. On the 4th October the\r\nfleet was scattered by a great storm at the entry to the Channel.\r\nBalchen’s flagship, the =Victory=, disappeared during the night of the\r\n4th-5th October with her crew of a thousand men. She was considered an\r\nill-built vessel and may have capsized, but Guernsey tradition asserted\r\nthat the sound of minute guns was heard from the Casketts through the\r\ngale, and it was guessed that the =Victory= had been driven on the\r\nrocks. In one way or the other the sea took its own.\r\n\r\nDuring 1745 the fleets cruised unopposed. In the Mediterranean\r\nAdmiral Rowley, who had succeeded Mathews, blockaded the Spaniards\r\nat Carthagena. He was so superior that he was able to send ships to\r\nharass the French trade as far off as the West Indies, to watch Cadiz,\r\nand to act against those Italian states in alliance with France. In\r\nAmerica a squadron sent from the Leeward islands under Commodore\r\nWarren, covered the expedition from New England, a partly patriotic and\r\npartly commercial speculation of the colonists, which took Louisbourg\r\nin Cape Breton from the French in April, May, and June. Our enemies\r\nwere so incapable and so unenterprising that our fleet had little to\r\ndo. During the latter part of the year the interest of the country was\r\nmainly turned on the Jacobite rising. The share of the navy in this\r\npassage of our history was naturally important, since it had to prevent\r\nthe French from sending help to the Jacobites. But no serious move was\r\nmade by the French fleet, and no opportunity for service other than\r\npatrolling the coast, and capturing single ships which endeavoured to\r\nslip in with money and stores for the Prince, presented itself. The\r\nnavy did indeed contribute materially to make the rising less serious\r\nthan it might have been. Prince Charles had sailed from Nantes with two\r\nvessels, the _Doutelle_, a small craft in which he himself sailed, and\r\nthe _Elizabeth_, a 64-gun ship employed to carry the bulk of his arms.\r\nWhen on the 47th parallel and thirty-nine leagues west of the Lizard,\r\nthey were met by the =Lion=, 58, commanded by Piercy Brett. He had been\r\none of Anson’s lieutenants, and had been appointed by him captain of\r\nthe =Centurion= at Canton. As the commodore was not authorised to have\r\na captain under him the Admiralty refused to confirm the commission.\r\nAnson, in great anger, had refused to accept promotion to the rank of\r\nthe rear-admiral. The ministerial change of December 1744 had brought\r\nhim back, and Brett, who had been made captain in the interval, was\r\nallowed to date his seniority from his appointment at Canton. He now\r\nattacked the _Elizabeth_, and the two fought one of the fiercest of\r\nrecorded single ship actions. They were so well matched that they beat\r\none another to a standstill, but the substantial fruits of victory\r\nremained with the =Lion=, for the _Elizabeth_ was compelled to put\r\nback. The _Doutelle_ went on and reached Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn 1746 the success of the Colonial expedition against Louisbourg,\r\nencouraged the Government to fit out an imitation of it to attack\r\nQuebec. Lestock, who retained a very ill-deserved reputation for\r\ncapacity, was appointed to command the ships, and Lieutenant-General\r\nSt. Clair, the troops, consisting of some engineers and artillery with\r\nsix regiments of foot. The preparations were delayed till the season\r\nwas passed for a voyage across the Atlantic. It was therefore sent to\r\nthe French coast on raiding expedition. Nothing need be recorded of it\r\nsave that it did not sail till the 14th of September, that troops were\r\nlanded cleverly enough to the west of Port Louis on the southern coast\r\nof Brittany, and then re-embarked when it was found that they had no\r\nmeans of taking the town of L’Orient, which lies a little behind Port\r\nLouis and further up the river Blavet. L’Orient was the dockyard of\r\nthe French East India Company, and its destruction was much desired by\r\nus. After failing at L’Orient, the expedition went on to Quiberon Bay,\r\nwhere it again landed soldiers, and again found that there was nothing\r\nto be done. Finally the transports carried the soldiers to Ireland, and\r\nLestock returned to Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1747, the new spirit at the Admiralty began to\r\ntell. The fleet was employed with vigour on well-selected services,\r\nand was rewarded with proportionate success. It was no longer used to\r\nconvey insufficient military expeditions to besiege towns they had not\r\nthe means of taking, or to invade countries they were not numerous\r\nenough to occupy. The French Government was stung by the fall of\r\nLouisbourg, and by the news from India, into making efforts to use its\r\nfleet to better purpose, and the increase of activity on both sides\r\ngave an energy to the naval war it had not as yet possessed. In spring\r\nit was known that two squadrons were to sail from France together and\r\nwere to divide at sea—one, commanded by M. de la Jonquière, was then\r\nto steer for America, and the other, of which M. St. George was the\r\nchief, was to sail for India. They were composed of eight king’s ships,\r\nand of six of the vessels of the French East India Company. Transports\r\nand merchant vessels were to go under their protection. A squadron of\r\nsixteen ships of from 40 to 90 guns were formed to intercept them, and\r\nAnson took the command while still retaining his seat on the Board. It\r\nis characteristic of the prevailing jobbery of the time that this force\r\nwas not got together without the necessity of defeating an intrigue.\r\nTwo of the vessels selected to serve under Anson were the =Defiance=,\r\n60, Captain Grenville, and the =Bristol=, 50, of which William\r\nMontagu, commonly called Mad Montagu, a brother of Lord Sandwich, was\r\ncaptain. Neither of these officers was wanting in spirit. Grenville\r\nwas killed in the action of the 3rd May, fighting most gallantly, and\r\nwhatever could have been said against the sense of Mad Montagu, a\r\nnoisy violent man of much deliberate eccentricity whose rôle it was to\r\nplay the rattlepated Jack Tar, his courage was above dispute. But both\r\nwould have preferred to cruise alone, and pick up prizes. Grenville\r\nbelonged to the famous “cousinhood” of the name, and his cousin George\r\nGrenville, who was on the Board, attempted a little manœuvre on his\r\nbehalf. An order to Anson not to keep the =Defiance= and =Bristol= with\r\nhim for more than seven days was put into a letter which the Duke of\r\nBedford was expected to sign without looking at it. The Duke did detect\r\nthe trick, and refused to sign, declaring that “they should deserve to\r\nbe hanged for it if it was done.”\r\n\r\nAnson sailed for his station off Finisterre on the 9th April, sent his\r\nlook-out sloops to watch Rochefort, and stretched his fleet out in a\r\nline abreast, each ship a mile from the other, in order to diminish\r\nthe risk that the enemy would pass undiscovered. In the early morning\r\nof the 3rd May the =Falcon= sloop brought the news that she had seen\r\nthe French the day before steering for the west. Anson called in all\r\ncruisers, collected his ships, and steered to cross the presumed route\r\nof the enemy. Between nine and ten the French squadron was seen to\r\nthe S.W. It was at first not possible to estimate its strength, for\r\nwarships and transports were all sailing together, and the one could\r\nnot be distinguished from the other. Anson therefore kept his fleet\r\nin a body lest he should meet an equal enemy whom it would be rash to\r\nattack in disorder. As the space between the two fleets was reduced,\r\nit was seen that the French had divided. Nine vessels were formed in a\r\nline to meet our attack, while the others were making off to leeward.\r\nLa Jonquière and St. George had, in fact, no more than that number\r\nof vessels fit to meet line-of-battle ships. When the inferiority of\r\nthe enemy’s force was seen, Anson ordered a general chase. The English\r\ncaptains went into action at their best speed, attacking the enemy\r\non both sides. The French fought brilliantly, but the superiority of\r\nforce against them was so overwhelming that they could do no more\r\nthan sacrifice themselves bravely in order to give their charge time\r\nto escape, which many of the merchant ships did succeed in doing. Six\r\nof the French king’s ships and four of the Company’s were taken. Yet\r\nthe French sold their defeat dear. Five hundred and twenty men were\r\nkilled and wounded in our ships. The loss of the enemy was about seven\r\nhundred. It was about four o’clock in the afternoon when the first of\r\nthe English ships—Anson’s old ship the =Centurion=, now commanded by\r\nhis former lieutenant, Denis—came up with the rear of the French ships\r\nas they were edging away to leeward, and hoping to delay our attack by\r\nshowing a firm front till the night should come. The action was over at\r\nseven. Anson was made a peer for the victory, which filled the country\r\nwith well-grounded delight. Our superiority in numbers and weight of\r\nships was great, and as a battle the action of the 3rd May was not\r\nglorious, but here was a success won by foresight, good management, and\r\nactivity against a gallant enemy. It was the first time that so much\r\ncould be said since the war began in 1739, and it was the promise of\r\ngreater things to come.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st-22nd June, some six weeks after Anson had ruined the French\r\nexpeditions to America and India, Captain Thomas Fox, who was cruising\r\nwith a small squadron on the 47th degree of North Latitude, met and\r\nscattered the valuable convoy coming home from San Domingo. Forty-eight\r\nprizes were taken by our ships, and the injury inflicted went beyond\r\nthe material loss, for the disaster showed how little able the French\r\nwere to protect their sea-borne commerce against the British Navy. They\r\nwere too weak to keep the road open, in face of energetic direction\r\ngiven to our forces by the new Admiralty. Before the close of the year\r\na third blow drove the lesson well home, and did a great deal to bring\r\nFrance to recognise the necessity for making peace. The outward bound\r\ntrading ships to the French West Indies were collected at Rochelle. A\r\nstrong squadron of eight line-of-battle ships of the French Royal Navy,\r\nand of one 64-gun ship belonging to the Indian Company, was told off\r\nto protect them. The Chef d’escadre, or Rear-Admiral, Desherbiers de\r\nl’Etanduère, was in command, with his flag flying in the _Tonnant_, 80,\r\na noble vessel. Indeed l’Etanduère’s squadron was a stronger one than\r\nLa Jonquière’s, and the vessels composing it were superior in build and\r\nstrength to our ships of the same nominal force. A powerful squadron\r\nwas prepared to intercept this convoy. What was wanted in quality of\r\nships we made up in number, and fourteen vessels were sent to overpower\r\nthe French nine. The command was given to Rear-Admiral Edward Hawke,\r\nthe captain of the =Berwick=, whose gallantry had stood out brilliantly\r\nagainst a background of blundering and pusillanimity in the battle of\r\nToulon five years before.\r\n\r\nBeing fixed by the necessity they were under of reaching the West\r\nIndies soon after the end of the hurricane season in October, the\r\nenemy’s time of sailing could be calculated. Hawke left England on the\r\n9th August for his cruising ground, the latitude of from 46° to 48°\r\nN. The enemy was sighted on the 14th October. The ensuing action was\r\nan almost exact reproduction of Anson’s engagement with La Jonquière.\r\nHawke has had an affectionate biographer in our time, and the glory he\r\nwon twelve years after this meeting with the convoy reflects back on\r\nall his life. Therefore he has naturally been credited with displaying\r\ngreat originality, but the truth is that he followed the pattern given\r\nhim by Anson six months before, down to the details. The English ships\r\napproached in order, till they were near enough to estimate the enemy’s\r\ninferior numbers. Then they went ahead in general chase, attacking\r\non both sides, and crushing their opponent by weight of numbers. As\r\nl’Etanduère’s squadron was stronger than La Jonquière’s, it made a\r\nharder fight. The French flagship, the _Tonnant_, proved too much for\r\nany of our vessels, and in company with the _Intrépide_, commanded by\r\nthe Count of Vaudreuil, broke her way through and escaped. Captain\r\nPhilip Saumarez in the =Nottingham=, 60, who pursued the two for a\r\ntime, was killed. But six of the eight French were taken. They did\r\nnot surrender till they were thoroughly wrecked. As his own vessels\r\nwere severely cut up, Hawke made his way home and reached port on the\r\n31st October. Meanwhile the French merchant ships, protected by the\r\n_Content_ and a frigate, had continued their voyage and had escaped for\r\nthe time being. Hawke, however, took the precaution to send a sloop\r\nto the West Indies with the news, and many of the French vessels were\r\ncaptured by our cruisers when nearing their destination.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that on both these occasions the French officers\r\nsecured the escape of the vessels put under their protection. The\r\nsubstantial victory may therefore, in a sense, be said to have been\r\ntheirs, since they did what they were sent out to do. The question then\r\narises whether Anson and Hawke could not have done better, since they\r\nwere sent out to interrupt the enemy’s commerce, and since they had a\r\nsuperiority of nearly two to one in fighting ships. They might have\r\ndetached four sail to pursue the trading vessels, and still have left\r\nthemselves a superiority over the French squadron of twelve to nine on\r\nthe 3rd May, and of ten to eight on the 9th October. Yet the policy of\r\nmaking the destruction of the fighting force of our enemy as near as\r\nmight be a certainty was the sound one, since, if his fleet was once\r\ndriven off the sea, his convoys could not sail at all. Moreover, it\r\nis to be remembered that in 1747 the general bad quality of our ships\r\nmight well lead our admirals to think that they could not afford to\r\ndispense with any superiority of numbers over the French.\r\n\r\nWith Hawke’s victory the naval war in Europe came to an end. In the\r\nEast Indies, however, it continued. One of the few relieving features\r\nin the dulness of this war—or these wars, the Spanish and the French—is\r\nthe extension of the activity of our fleet into the remote east.\r\nHitherto when the Royal Navy had gone to the Indian Seas it had been\r\non particular missions, but from 1744 it acted there continuously, and\r\nin squadrons, for so long as the countries were at war in Europe. Not\r\nthat anything the navy did there was very flattering to our pride.\r\nRather the contrary, indeed, since the dispensation by which it was\r\narranged that while we were bad, our enemy should be even worse, was\r\nnowhere more conspicuously to our advantage. Yet it marks one step in\r\nthe growth of the navy that it is found taking over its duties on the\r\nother side of the world.\r\n\r\nIn 1744 a squadron of 4 ships, two of 60, one of 50, and one of 20\r\nguns, was sent to the Eastern Seas under Commodore Curtis Barnett.\r\nHere at once there is occasion to note how well we were served by\r\nthe folly of our opponent. A man was then at Paris who was admirably\r\nqualified to defeat any enterprise we might undertake against the\r\nFrench posts in India. This was Bertrand Mahé de la Bourdonnais,\r\ngovernor of the French islands of Bourbon and Mauritius. He had not\r\nbeen trained as a king’s officer, though the rank of Capitaine de\r\nFrégate was conferred upon him. He was a native of St. Malo, a merchant\r\nskipper and trader. But he had acquired all the knowledge needed to\r\nmake a skilful naval commander, and had shown great faculty in his\r\ngovernment. La Bourdonnais was convinced that England would attack\r\nthe French settlements in the East, and he laid a scheme before the\r\nking’s ministers for forestalling us. His plan was accepted, and he was\r\npromised a squadron of five vessels. But La Bourdonnais, most happily\r\nfor us, had excited the hostility of the French East Company by his\r\nself-assertive character, and his exposures of its corruptions, and\r\nhis talent for scornful retort. The company opposed his scheme, and\r\nhad influence enough to get it laid aside. It persuaded itself and\r\nthe king’s ministers that it would be possible to maintain neutrality\r\nwith the English East India Company. Neither thought fit to consider\r\nthe probable action of the British Government, which might very well\r\ndecline to be guided by the company. Being deprived of the force\r\npromised to him, La Bourdonnais was driven back on his own resources,\r\nand on those he could draw from the islands.\r\n\r\nCommodore Barnett sailed from Spithead on the 5th May 1744, and after\r\ntouching at Porto Praya in the Cape Verd islands, went on to the Indian\r\nOcean. After rounding the Cape, he visited Madagascar, where fresh meat\r\ncould always be got from the natives, and then stood over to the coast\r\nof Sumatra. He detached two of his vessels to take post in the Straits\r\nof Malacca, between Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, and himself went\r\nthrough the Straits of Sunda, between Sumatra and Java, and took up his\r\nstation in the Banca Straits, between Sumatra and Borneo. He was thus\r\non the trade route between China and the European possessions on the\r\ncoast of Coromandel. On the 25th January 1745 three French China ships\r\nof great value sailed right into his hands. In these far seas he did\r\nnot trouble to look for an Admiralty Court, but carried his prizes into\r\nBatavia, sold them to the Dutch for £92,000, and divided the proceeds\r\nat the capstan head. Then he came across to Madras.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the English and the French Company did, to some\r\nextent, justify those who held that a neutrality could be maintained if\r\nthe traders only were considered. The English Company was flourishing,\r\nand asked nothing better than to be allowed to trade in peace. The\r\nFrench Company was not so well off, and therefore was much more lean,\r\nhungry, and disposed to adventure. But it was not strong on land, and\r\nat sea had so far no force. A tacit arrangement was made by which\r\nthe French promised to abstain from attacking us by land, so long as\r\nBarnett did not assail them from the sea. The Company persuaded the\r\ncommodore to accept this arrangement, and 1745 passed in insignificant\r\nmovements. Barnett died in the spring of 1746 at Fort St. Davids.\r\n\r\nThe command now fell to the senior captain, Edward Peyton, and its\r\nfortunes in his hands have caused the death of Barnett to be esteemed\r\na misfortune. The arrival of reinforcements from home and arming of a\r\nprize taken from the French had raised the number of the squadron to\r\nsix, one of 60, three of 50, one of 40, and one of 20 guns. It had,\r\ntherefore, a total of 270 guns, and all the vessels, with the exception\r\nperhaps of the French prize, were built for war. The quality of the\r\nsquadron must be taken into account in estimating what followed. While\r\nour ships were idly parading the Bay of Bengal, La Bourdonnais was\r\nstraining every nerve to fit out a squadron at the Île de France,\r\nnow Mauritius. In the spring of 1746 he had scraped together, by all\r\nkinds of devices and makeshifts, eight vessels, one of them being a\r\nman-of-war mounting 70 guns, and the others converted merchant ships\r\nof from 26 to 36 guns. The total was 292, and most of the pieces were\r\nsmall. The vessels were indeed full of men, but a large proportion\r\nof them were Lascars and Caffres. La Bourdonnais sailed on the 29th\r\nMarch, and after nearly suffering total shipwreck on Madagascar left\r\nit for the Coromandel coast in May, and arrived there in June. On\r\nthe 25th of this month, before he had touched at any of the French\r\nsettlements, he met the English squadron at sea between Fort St.\r\nDavids, at Cuddalore, and Negapatam, to the south of Pondicherry, the\r\nchief French port. Knowing his inferiority in artillery La Bourdonnais\r\ntried to come to close quarters and overpower the English by the number\r\nof his men. Peyton baffled this effort by keeping well to windward, and\r\nthe encounter resolved itself into a distant cannonade, by which one of\r\nthe French ships was crippled and very little harm was done to us. That\r\nlittle was enough to deprive Peyton of all desire to meet the French\r\nagain. He held a council of war next morning, and by its advice sailed\r\naway to Trincomalee, leaving La Bourdonnais free to continue his voyage\r\nto Pondicherry. The decision was without excuse, for if Peyton had used\r\nhis eyes at all during the cannonade of the day before, he must have\r\nlearnt that he had to deal with ships of very inferior armament. But\r\nsome of his own vessels were in no good condition, and he could think\r\nof nothing but of their defects, and of the excuse afforded him for a\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nLa Bourdonnais anchored at Pondicherry on the 9th July, and began at\r\nonce to prepare for attacks on our settlements. The history of his\r\nquarrels with Dupleix, the governor-general, does not concern the naval\r\noperations, since they did not prevent him for carrying out his attack\r\non Madras. He was at sea again on the 4th August to look for Peyton,\r\nand met the English commander coming back from Ceylon. From the 8th\r\nto the 11th August the two squadrons were in sight of one another,\r\nbut so convinced was Peyton of the inferiority of his squadron that\r\nhe not only avoided action but sailed away to Bengal. La Bourdonnais\r\nnow returned to Pondicherry, picked up soldiers, and sailed for Madras\r\non the 15th August. The action of Peyton was again unpardonable,\r\nfor even if he felt too weak to engage the French at sea, he could\r\nhave contributed men and guns to the defence of Madras. The help his\r\nmere presence on the coast would have afforded is proved by the fact\r\nthat when in the middle of the siege La Bourdonnais received a false\r\nreport of the appearance of large English ships, he was preparing to\r\nre-embark his men. But the French commander was not one of those who\r\nare to be drawn off by mere rumours. He waited for confirmation, and\r\nwhen it did not come, he pushed the siege, and the place surrendered\r\non the 29th September. This event and its consequences, the breach of\r\nthe capitulation made by La Bourdonnais and the seizure of the town\r\nby Dupleix, were the beginning of the great fight between the two\r\ncompanies. At the change of the monsoon in October, which suspended\r\nnaval operations for sailing ships, La Bourdonnais returned to his own\r\ngovernment in the islands, and appeared no more in those seas. He was\r\ncompelled to return home, was accused of corruption by his opponents\r\nof the company, and died ruined and broken-hearted. Once more our best\r\nhelp came from our enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1747, Peyton was superseded by Rear-Admiral\r\nGriffin, who is accused of treating his predecessor with great\r\nbrutality. It is very possible, for Griffin was one of the bad officers\r\nwho then infested our navy, insolently tyrannical to his subordinates,\r\nand shy before the enemy. His own conduct was no better than Peyton’s,\r\nfor he allowed M. de Bouvet, with a much inferior squadron from\r\nMauritius, to revictual the French garrison of Madras, and did nothing\r\nagainst him either coming or going.\r\n\r\nNow, however, the East Indies began to profit by the revival of\r\nenergy and intelligence at the Admiralty. A squadron of ten ships,\r\nof which six were of the line, was sent out at the end of 1747 under\r\nthe command of Edward Boscawen, one of the new race of officers who\r\nwere being brought forward by Anson and Bedford. Boscawen owed much\r\nto family influence, for he was a brother of the Viscount Falmouth,\r\nwho once cowed a recalcitrant secretary of state by significantly\r\nsaying, “Remember, sir, we are seven,” that being the number of pocket\r\nboroughs owned by the Boscawen family. But the admiral was a man of\r\nability, who would have won promotion at any time when it was to be won\r\nby merit. He sailed in November, but did not reach Fort St. Davids,\r\nwhich since the loss of Madras had become the Company’s chief station\r\non the Coromandel coast, till the 29th July 1748. The length of the\r\nvoyage was due partly to delay at the Cape to recruit the health of\r\nthe crews and partly to an unsuccessful attempt to land at Mauritius.\r\nThe force collected under Boscawen was the greatest seen as yet in\r\neastern waters, for it consisted of ten English line-of-battle ships,\r\nand five smaller vessels, together with armed vessels belonging to\r\nour own Company and the Dutch. The French had nothing to oppose to\r\nthis armament on the sea, and as the admiral had brought 1500 soldiers\r\nwith him, it would seem that it ought to have been easy to sweep the\r\nFrench from the coast of Coromandel altogether. But the military forces\r\nwere of inferior quality, consisting of independent companies raised\r\nfor the service of the Company, and had as yet no military spirit.\r\nThe scientific branches, and in particular the engineers who were of\r\nthe first importance for siege work, were very poor. The siege of\r\nPondicherry, undertaken in revenge for the capture of Madras, was badly\r\nmanaged, and turned out a complete failure. Boscawen, who directed\r\nthe operations on shore, was no general, and was badly served by his\r\nengineers. A bombardment by the fleet took place on the 26th September,\r\nbut it was little better than a farce, for the shallow water made it\r\nimpossible for our ships to approach near enough for their fire to\r\nbe effective. At a later period in the fighting in the Carnatic the\r\nCompany’s soldiers found that they were being fired at with the cannon\r\nballs then wasted on Pondicherry. After lasting from the 8th August to\r\nthe 30th September, after not a few panics among the raw soldiers of\r\nthe army and the sailors landed to work the guns, the siege was raised\r\nwith a loss of 1065 Europeans.\r\n\r\nPeace had now been made in Europe, and Madras was restored in return\r\nfor Louisbourg. The war indeed was only beginning between the\r\nCompanies, but henceforward it was carried on ashore, and in the name\r\nof the native princes. Boscawen returned in the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR TILL 1758\r\n\r\n AUTHORITIES.—See Chapter IV.; Mr. J. Corbett, _Seven Years’ War_;\r\n     Barrow, _Anson_ and _Howe_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may appear that I have given undue prominence to the corruption and\r\nbad spirit of the navy in these years. But the insistence has been\r\ndeliberate, for the great work which had to be done from 1744 onwards,\r\nfor a generation, was to raise the standard of conduct expected from\r\nofficers, not only by public opinion working from without, but by their\r\nown code of honour working within the ranks of the service. This would\r\nonly be effected by bringing forward new men. If rules and regulations\r\ncould have saved the navy from discredit and mismanagement, it had\r\nall it needed in the code of the Duke of York. The evil lay not in\r\nthe laws but the men. Till they were better there was no real hope of\r\nreform. That one was wanted was beyond all question. In 1749 Sandwich,\r\nnow First Lord, acting perhaps at the instigation, and certainly with\r\nthe hearty approval, of Anson, made an Admiralty visitation of the\r\ndockyards. It was the first ever held by the Lords of the Admiralty or\r\neven by the administrative officers of the Navy Board. According to\r\nSir John Barrow, who condensed the report in his life of Anson, they,\r\n_i.e._ the Lords of the Admiralty, “found the men generally idle,\r\nthe officers ignorant, the stores ill-arranged, abuses of all kinds\r\noverlooked, the timber ill-assorted, that which was longest in store\r\nbeing undermost, the Standing Orders neglected, the ships in ordinary\r\nin a very dirty and bad condition, filled with women and children,\r\nand that the officers of the yard had not visited them, which it was\r\ntheir duty to do; that men were found borne and paid as officers who\r\nhad never done duty as such, for which their Lordships reprimanded the\r\nNavy Board through the comptroller; that the store-keepers’ accounts\r\nwere many years in arrear, and, what was most extraordinary, that\r\nthe Navy Board had never required them;—in short, gross negligence,\r\nirregularities, waste, and embezzlement were so palpable, that their\r\nLordships ordered an advertisement to be set in the various parts of\r\nthe yards, offering encouragement and protection to such as should\r\ndiscover any misdemeanours, committed either by the officers or\r\nworkmen, particularly in employing workmen or labourers, on their\r\nprivate affairs, or in any other abuse whatever.”\r\n\r\nThe abuses noted, and for a time amended by the Commission of James I.\r\nand by James II., had sprung up again to their old height under the\r\nfavour of negligence and self-seeking at headquarters. It was idle to\r\nhope to deal with these evils by sporadic visitations and encouragement\r\nto the common informer. What was wanted was constant watching, and it\r\nwas long before this was supplied. Lord Sandwich’s visitation was not\r\nrepeated, and it was not till 1770 that Sir Edward Hawke ordered one\r\nto be held every two years. Even this measure proved of little effect,\r\nand the first years of the nineteenth century were reached before the\r\nold element of slovenly corruption had become intolerable and Lord St.\r\nVincent was able to begin a thorough reform.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary to cleaning out the dockyards was the bringing of the\r\nnavy’s combatant branches up to the due level. It was a matter of life\r\nand death for England that this should be done. The great weakness of\r\nFrance at sea and the decadence of Spain, allowed us to escape disaster\r\nin the War of the Austrian Succession. The same conditions were\r\nrepeated in the war which began in 1755. But if we had met the great\r\nAmerican War in 1778 with the navy in the condition in which it was in\r\n1739, and then had been called upon to face the revived naval power of\r\nFrance, the somewhat improved navy of Spain and the Dutch, irreparable\r\ndisaster must have followed. We could not have endured that strain with\r\nMathews, Lestock, Vernon, Knowles, Griffin, Peyton, Cornelius Mitchell,\r\nWatson, and Elton.\r\n\r\nIn 1746 the Government took steps to regulate promotion to flag rank.\r\nIt had hitherto been the custom to select the officers for the higher\r\ncommands from any place in the list of captains, though they were\r\nnaturally taken from towards the top. The captains passed over were\r\nleft in the same rank and on their scanty half pay of ten or eight\r\nshillings a day. Though the state was undoubtedly entitled to take\r\ncompetent men where it could find them, it was felt that this practice\r\nof passing over old officers who might have to serve under juniors, or\r\nwere left in poverty, inflicted a hardship. It also had the obvious\r\ndrawback that it left the list of captains crowded with men who were\r\nbeyond work. An Order in Council, issued on the 3rd June 1747, decided\r\nthat when old officers in the rank of captain were passed over by the\r\npromotion of the younger men to flag rank, they were to “be appointed\r\nby commissions from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to be\r\nrear-admirals in general terms.” The effect of the order was this.\r\nThe active list of admirals consisted of those who belonged to one of\r\nthe squadrons—Red, White, or Blue. When then a captain was meant to\r\nserve at sea he was promoted Rear-Admiral of the Blue. The captains\r\nsenior to him were named merely rear-admirals. This gave them no right\r\nto command. They were superannuated with a rear-admiral’s pension,\r\nin order that they might “retire with honour and have a competent\r\nsubsistence in their old age.” It was the introduction of the modern\r\nsystem of allowing men to retire with a rank above that which they\r\nhold when their active service ends. The benefits of the order were\r\nlimited to old officers who had served at sea since the beginning of\r\nthe war with Spain in 1739, but the hardship inflicted on those not so\r\nqualified was confined to one generation. In future the old officer\r\nwho was passed over because of his “great age and other infirmities”\r\nknew that he would “retire with honour.” The disadvantage of the system\r\nwas that when the state wished to reach some capable officer well down\r\non the list it had to make a great addition to what is now called the\r\nnon-effective vote, that is to the pensioned men who are doing no work.\r\nBut the advantages of putting a stop to an old grievance, of giving\r\nsecurity and content to the officers, and of enabling the Admiralty to\r\nbring on younger men, were cheaply bought at this price.\r\n\r\nAnother piece of work taken in hand was the improvement of the quality\r\nof the ships. The inferiority of our vessels was seen so soon as they\r\ncame to be compared with the Spanish and French. Inquiry showed that\r\nthough schemes had been drawn up in 1706 and 1719, and attempts had\r\nbeen made to improve the ships later, they had all been habitually\r\nneglected. Our vessels had been built, not only on bad principles, but\r\nnot on any regular scale, so that vessels of the same rate were of\r\ndifferent sizes, and the fittings of one could not be used for another.\r\nHere as elsewhere there was waste. A new scheme was made in 1746 and\r\nmodified in 1751 without bringing complete amendment.\r\n\r\nThe scandals of the navy had also shown the necessity for a revision of\r\nthe laws regulating the discipline of the service. Hitherto the Navy\r\nDiscipline Act had been that passed in the thirteenth year of Charles\r\nII. (1661). It conferred the right of holding courts martial, but under\r\ninconvenient limitations. The jurisdiction of the court was confined\r\nto offences committed on the high seas, and in the main rivers of His\r\nMajesty’s possessions below bridges. There was thus no power to punish\r\noffences committed ashore or in foreign countries. This was conferred\r\nin 1720, and some further amendments were made in 1745 and 1748. The\r\nworst defects of the old system remained and they were serious. The\r\npower to hold a court martial was given only to the commander-in-chief,\r\nthat is the admiral or captain acting as commodore, with a separate\r\ncommand. If he died, or was compelled to come home by bad health,\r\nanother commission had to be sent out to his successor. When Vernon\r\ncame home from the West Indies, his successor, Sir Chaloner Ogle, was\r\nleft for a whole year without power to hold a court martial, as the\r\nfirst vessel sent out with his commission was captured. Neither could\r\nthe power be delegated by the commander-in-chief to any officer whom\r\nhe detached. It was alleged in the course of the debates in Parliament\r\nin 1749 that, during the late war, a captain serving on the coast of\r\nPortugal had put his first lieutenant in irons. He went into Lisbon\r\nwhere there were several other warships, and the imprisoned officer\r\napplied for a court martial, but as the commander-in-chief was not\r\npresent none could be held. The vessel left for England with the first\r\nlieutenant still in irons. On her way a French man-of-war was met. The\r\ncaptain then gave such visible proofs of derangement of mind, that the\r\nother officers shut him in his cabin and released the first lieutenant\r\nwho took command of the ship. When she reached home an inquiry was\r\nmade, and it was found that the captain was insane.\r\n\r\nIn another respect there was room for amendment. The commander-in-chief\r\nwas himself president of the court, which consisted of all the\r\npost-captains in sight when the court-martial flag was hoisted.\r\nThe want of a limitation in the number made the tribunal often\r\nof a most unwieldy size. It was also obviously in the power of a\r\ncommander-in-chief to pack a court, by sending away all the captains\r\nwhom he could not trust to acquit or condemn “by order.” As he was the\r\nonly authorised president he was there to give the order himself. When\r\nit is remembered that every admiral had then, and afterwards, a number\r\nof “followers,” officers who had served under him, and whom he always\r\nmade interest to have with him, and who for their part looked to him\r\nto push their fortunes, when too we remember the brutal temper of such\r\nmen as Mathews, Lestock, and Griffin, it will be seen that this was no\r\nimaginary danger, indeed bitter complaints were made of the partiality\r\nof the courts martial.\r\n\r\nThe new act of 1749—the 22nd George II.—corrected these defects. It\r\nprovided that the right to hold courts martial should go with the\r\ncommand, thereby removing the risk of such a break as occurred in the\r\ncase of Vernon and Ogle, and that it could be delegated to officers\r\ncommanding detachments. Further, it took away the right to act as\r\npresident from the commander-in-chief and gave it to the second in\r\ncommand. It limited the number of officers sitting in the court to not\r\nless than five, or more than thirteen. It also limited the court’s\r\npower of inflicting imprisonment for any offence to two years, and for\r\ncontempt to a month. The cases of the master of the =Northumberland=\r\nand of Lieutenant Frye of the Marines had no doubt their share in\r\nbringing about this change.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the alterations made in 1749 was that inserted\r\nin the 12th and 13th articles of the Articles of War which were\r\nincorporated in the Act. The 12th article provides the punishment to\r\nbe inflicted “on Every Person in the Fleet who through Cowardice,\r\nNegligence, or Disaffection, shall in Time of Action withdraw or\r\nhold back, or not come into the fight or Engagement, or shall not do\r\nhis utmost to take or destroy every ship which it shall be his Duty\r\nto engage, and to assist and relieve all and every of his Majesty’s\r\nShips or those of his Allies which it shall be his duty to assist and\r\nrelieve.” The 13th Article deals with him who hangs back in chase or\r\ndoes not “relieve or assist a known Friend in View to the utmost of his\r\nPower.” Originally the court had a discretion, but by the terms of the\r\nnew Act the only punishment a court martial could inflict was death. At\r\na later period the severity of this penalty was considered excessive,\r\nand in 1779 the power to inflict a lesser penalty was restored to the\r\ncourt martial, but in 1749 Parliament had just heard from the mouth\r\nof Vernon that the savage punishment of poor young Baker Philipps was\r\njust, and it knew how austere the court had been with humble James\r\nDixon, the master of the =Northumberland=. It also knew what bowels of\r\ncompassion had been found for the captains of Toulon and for Lestock\r\nand Mitchell. If Parliament was resolved that what was law for obscure\r\nand friendless men should also be law for the chiefs of the navy, it\r\nmay have been stern but it was not unjust. The Bill was introduced by\r\nministers who had the advice of Anson, and we may fairly conclude that\r\nhe did not disapprove of the change.\r\n\r\nFrom 1748 to 1756 the country remained at peace, but it was of the\r\nkind compatible with continuous “military operations.” Both in the\r\nEast Indies and on the continent of North America and among the\r\nislands of the West Indies, the British Government of that time had\r\nto deal with a more violent version of what we have seen happen in\r\nour day in the valleys of the Nile and the Congo. The main outlines\r\nof the struggle were given at the beginning of the last chapter. On\r\nthe frontier of Nova Scotia the two states were in peculiar contact\r\nof irritation. The frontier had never been clearly marked, and the\r\nFrench strove to delimit it in their own favour by a characteristic\r\nmixture of pertinacious diplomatic pettifogging and violence. In\r\nthe East the intrigues of Dupleix with the native princes of the\r\nCarnatic aimed at ruining the commerce of the English company by\r\ncutting off the establishments on the coast of Coromandel from access\r\nto the interior. On the continent of America the seventy thousand\r\nor so French in Canada and Louisiana were incessantly endeavouring,\r\nnot only to recover the greater part of Nova Scotia, but to bar the\r\nmillion and a half of English settlers from access to the valleys\r\nof the Ohio and the Mississippi. Resolute action on the part of the\r\nBritish Government would probably have averted war, but the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, who was the prevailing politician of the day, was intent on\r\nParliamentary management. The king too was rendered nervous by fears\r\nfor his hereditary dominions in Hanover. From sheer want of vigorous\r\ndirection on our own part we drifted, through a succession of small\r\nconflicts, into open though unavowed war in 1755, and into formally\r\ndeclared war in 1756. The situation was that of 1739, with differences.\r\nThen we had begun with the Spaniards, and had only come into collision\r\nwith the French later on. Spain, in this case, did not intervene till\r\nthe very close, and in an hour of folly. Once again, too, France became\r\nentangled in a great European land war, and was unable to devote her\r\nwhole attention to the sea. We engaged in the land war as allies of\r\nFrederick of Prussia and in defence of Hanover, but our main attention\r\nwas devoted to the sea and to our colonies.\r\n\r\nThe first serious hostile movement made by the British Government was\r\ndirected towards the East. The India Company had soon occasion to\r\nregret that it had parted so easily with Boscawen’s squadron. In 1753\r\nit was calling on the Government for naval help, and in February 1755\r\na squadron was despatched under the command of Rear-Admiral Charles\r\nWatson. It was delayed at Kinsale by a storm, and two vessels were\r\nseriously damaged. They were replaced, and Watson reached Bombay in\r\nNovember with four sail of the line, and two small vessels. He brought\r\na reinforcement of troops and Colonel Clive. His first piece of\r\nservice was not against the French. The Royal Navy was now beginning\r\nto take permanent hold on the Eastern seas. No more pressing duty\r\nawaited it than to put a stop to piracy. This had always flourished\r\non the western or Malabar coast of India, and had never been\r\neffectually checked by the Portuguese, the Dutch, or by ourselves.\r\nBy far the most formidable of these pirates belonged to a branch of\r\nthe Mahrattas, which had gained possession of the island of Geriah,\r\nhad become independent, and had transferred its native practice of\r\nrobbery from the land to the sea. These pirate Mahrattas infested\r\nthe coast in vessels called “grabs” and “gallivats”—the first a\r\nspecies of magnified lighter armed with guns, the second light rowing\r\nand sailing galleys. Sporadic attacks had been made on them by the\r\ncompany, and by occasional ships of the Royal Navy. Mathews had served\r\nagainst them. But hitherto nothing effectual had been done. In 1755\r\nthe presence of a well-appointed squadron and of a disposable body of\r\ntroops encouraged the company’s agents at Bombay to make an effort to\r\nroot out the pirates of Geriah. On the 7th of February 1756 Watson\r\nsailed from Bombay, carrying the soldiers under command of Clive with\r\nhim, and in co-operation with a body of Mahratta troops supplied by\r\none of the princes of that nation, who wished to reduce Angria, the\r\nchief of the pirate state, to obedience. They proved to be of little\r\nvalue, for they were chiefly intent on plunder, and had secretly more\r\nsympathy with their piratical kinsmen than with their allies. Angria\r\nshowed little spirit. The vigour of Admiral Watson who battered down\r\nthe fortifications of Geriah on the 12th February, and the firmness of\r\nClive who took possession of the place, disappointed the Mahrattas. Our\r\nsquadron and the troops divided £150,000 of prize money.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th April Watson and Clive went on from the coast of Malabar to\r\nthat of Coromandel on the east. By the 20th June they reached Madras.\r\nThe French Government, not being as yet ready for war, had recalled\r\nDupleix and had brought a pause in the conflict of the companies.\r\nWatson’s next service was to carry Clive to Bengal to revenge the\r\nBlack Hole of Calcutta, and to begin the conquest of India. But as\r\nthis service became rapidly connected with the war against France, and\r\nas the operations in the eastern seas lay very much apart, I shall\r\nturn from them till they can be taken up again, and connected with the\r\ngeneral movements of the world-wide conflict.\r\n\r\nWhile Admiral Watson’s squadron was recruiting from its long voyage at\r\nBombay, warlike operations, the forerunners of open war, were beginning\r\non the Atlantic. The appeals of the colonists who found themselves\r\nunable to expel the French from the post they had established on\r\nthe Ohio—Fort Duquesne on the site of what is now Pittsburg—had at\r\nlast induced the British Government to take action. In December 1754\r\nCommodore Keppel, a gentleman of the Albemarle family, who had sailed\r\nas midshipman with Anson and was destined to play a prominent part in\r\ncoming years, left the Downs with a body of troops under command of\r\nBraddock. The expedition reached Hampton Roads by the 20th February\r\n1755. Its disastrous end, in an ill-planned and worse-directed attack\r\non Fort Duquesne in July of this year, is a well-known episode of\r\nour colonial history. The sending of Braddock stimulated the French\r\nGovernment to reinforce its garrisons in Canada. On the 3rd May of\r\n1755 the Lieutenant-General Count de Macnémara sailed from Brest with\r\nnine sail of the line fully armed and seven frigates. He had under his\r\nprotection eleven sail of the line fitted as transports and full of\r\ntroops. These vessels were armed with 24 or 22 guns only, or as the\r\nFrench expression has it, _en flûte_. To be armed _en flûte_ was to be\r\narmed like a flyboat with guns only on the upper deck. Macnémara saw\r\nhis charge well out into the ocean, and then returned to Brest with six\r\nof the liners and three of the frigates. The other warships and the\r\ntransports held on to Canada under the command of Dubois de Lamotte.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the news that the French were in motion stirred the British\r\nGovernment to counter action. Boscawen was ordered to sail for America\r\nwith instructions to intercept the French by force. He left on the\r\n27th April, with eleven sail of the line, and two small vessels. After\r\nhe had gone the cabinet received further reports which gave them an\r\nexaggerated idea of the French strength. Admiral Holburne was ordered\r\nto follow Boscawen with six sail of the line, and a frigate. He left\r\non the 11th May, and joined his chief on the banks of Newfoundland on\r\nthe 20th June. But Boscawen had already failed to stop the French.\r\nWhen Dubois de Lamotte approached Newfoundland he divided his squadron\r\nand convoy into two. One division was steered to enter St. Lawrence\r\nby the Straits of Belleisle, on the north of Newfoundland. The other\r\ntook the commonly used route to the south between Cape Ray and Cape\r\nBreton. Boscawen had stationed himself off Cape Ray. On the 9th June\r\nthe French were sighted, but the weather was foggy and covered them\r\nsoon from view. Next day the fog lifted for a space, and three of the\r\nFrench ships were seen. They were the _Alcide_, 64, the _Lys_, armed\r\n_en flûte_ with 22 guns, and the _Dauphin Royal_, another of the\r\nman-of-war transports. The _Alcide_ was commanded by M. d’Hocquart who\r\nhad already been twice prisoner of war to Boscawen. In 1744, when he\r\nwas captain of the _Medée_, 26, he had been taken by the =Dreadnought=.\r\nThis was Boscawen’s first ship, and from it he got his name of “Old\r\nDreadnought” among the sailors. Again M. d’Hocquart had struck to\r\nBoscawen in Anson’s battle of 3rd May 1747. When the English officer\r\ncommanded the =Namur= and he himself the _Diamant_, M. d’Hocquart’s\r\nill fortune pursued him. The _Alcide_ was overhauled, hailed by Howe\r\nin the =Dunkirk=, 60, and told to stop. The French captain asked\r\nwhether it was peace or war, and was told that he had better prepare\r\nfor war. D’Hocquart made all the defence he could, but the =Dunkirk=\r\nwas reinforced by Boscawen’s ship, the =Torbay=, 74, and he became a\r\nprisoner for the third time. The _Lys_ was taken by the =Defiance=, and\r\nthe =Fougueux=. The _Dauphin Royal_ escaped in the fog. No other prizes\r\nwere taken, so that Dubois de Lamotte carried two fully armed liners,\r\nthree frigates, and ten transports with their men and stores safe into\r\nthe French American ports. Boscawen’s expedition was therefore, in the\r\nmain, a failure. The jail fever was raging in his squadron. It had\r\nbeen manned, according to old custom, in haste on the approach of war,\r\nby the press, from the slums and the prisons. Boscawen took his ships\r\nto Halifax in the hope of restoring the health of his crews, but with\r\nthe result that he infected the town. Meanwhile the French commanders,\r\nfinding the coast clear, sailed for home on the 15th August and reached\r\nBrest on the 21st September. Boscawen returned in the autumn, reaching\r\nEngland in November.\r\n\r\nWhile fighting had begun in America we were at home in a state of\r\nwar which was no war. The Duke of Newcastle was driven by dread\r\nof unpopularity to appear to do something. The country, thoroughly\r\npersuaded that the time had come when it must make the decisive fight\r\nfor its trade and colonies, was burning for war. But continental\r\ncomplications, and above all his own vacillating timid character, made\r\nNewcastle shrink from vigorous action. There was indeed an immense\r\nbustle of preparation. Ships were ordered into commission by the\r\nscore from the beginning of the year, and the work of putting the\r\nfleet on a war footing was accompanied by the inseparable offers of\r\nbounty and press-warrants. On the 23rd January 1755 there came out\r\none proclamation offering a bounty of thirty shillings to every able\r\nseaman between twenty and fifty years of age who would volunteer, and\r\ntwenty shillings to every ordinary seaman. On the 8th February another\r\nfollowed recalling all seamen serving abroad, and raising the bounties\r\nto £3 and £2, while the common informer was stimulated by rewards of\r\n£2 to whomsoever would tell where an able seaman was in hiding, and of\r\n£1, 10s. to the betrayer of an ordinary. A hot press went on in all\r\nthe ports. The war was a merchants’ war, and the traders of London\r\nand the outports offered bounties in addition to those given by the\r\nstate. By this combination of persuasion and force the fleet was manned\r\nafter a fashion. Yet the mere fact that the competition for men sent\r\nup the wages of merchant seamen by leaps and bounds made the work\r\nof filling up the warships very difficult. It was necessary to have\r\nrecourse to the prisoners in the jails, who were allowed to volunteer\r\ninto the navy, or were sent there as punishment. Parliament suspended\r\nthe provisions of the Navigation Laws, which limited the number of\r\nforeigners who could serve in a British ship to one-fourth. It even\r\ntempted them to serve under our flag by allowing them to obtain letters\r\nof naturalisation at the end of two years, instead of the usual limit\r\nof eight. By this act the Crown was empowered to suspend the manning\r\nclauses of the Navigation Laws whenever war should break out in future.\r\n\r\nThe dire need for men led to the adoption of two measures, one of\r\nprivate enterprise, which did good work in its time, one administrative\r\nof which we feel the benefit to this day. In 1756 was founded the\r\nMarine Society. This body was formed to take charge of destitute\r\nboys, whom it fed, clothed, and sent into the navy, where they were\r\ntrained as seamen. The spring of 1755 is a notable epoch in the history\r\nof the Royal Navy, for it saw the foundation of the present corps of\r\nMarines. The regiments raised hitherto had always been “disbanded”\r\nor “broken” at the end of the wars. They had never held a properly\r\nsettled position, and there had been a constant tendency to rob the\r\nforce of its best men by rating them as able seamen so soon as they\r\nhad been long enough at sea to learn the business. At the end of the\r\nWar of the Austrian Succession the Duke of Cumberland had recommended\r\nthe formation of a permanent military corps to be placed entirely\r\nunder the authority of the Admiralty. Nothing, however, was done till\r\nthe 3rd April 1755, when the Lords Justices, who governed during the\r\nabsence of the king in Hanover, issued a warrant authorising the\r\nformation of fifty companies of one hundred men each, which were to\r\nhave their headquarters at Chatham, Portsmouth, and Plymouth. The value\r\nof the Marines (the title Royal was not granted till 1802) was rapidly\r\ndemonstrated, and their numbers were increased. Thirty companies were\r\nadded before the end of 1755. Twenty more were ordered to be raised in\r\nJuly 1756, and another thirty in March 1757. Two years later, on 3rd\r\nMarch 1759, one lieutenant, one corporal, one drummer, and twenty-three\r\nprivates were added to every company. By the end of the war the total\r\nstrength of the force was 18,000.\r\n\r\nAll this stress of preparation was presided over by mere infirmity\r\nof will. In July the Ministry, still guided by Newcastle, sent Sir\r\nEdward Hawke to sea with twenty-one sail of the line, but with no\r\ndefinite orders to begin hostilities. He was told to intercept a French\r\nsquadron from the West Indies and to capture French merchant ships.\r\nThe squadron put into Cadiz, got warning which enabled it to avoid the\r\nEnglish fleet, and reached Brest safely. But 300 merchant ships manned\r\nby 8000 men were taken, and carried into our ports. This seizure of\r\ntrading ships in a time of nominal peace gave the French Government\r\nan opportunity to denounce us to Europe as pirates. Many Englishmen\r\nthought it would have been more for our honour to make war openly,\r\nsince we were about making it at all. Yet the French had little right\r\nto complain after the example they had set in India and America. The\r\nvessels were not condemned as prize, and as they were largely loaded\r\nwith fish their cargoes rotted, so that it was necessary to tow them\r\nout to sea and sink them. Hawke returned to port, ill pleased with the\r\nwork he had been set to do, and was replaced in the Channel command\r\nby Admiral Byng. Then Byng was sent out to convince the country that\r\nsomething was being done. He took a French line-of-battle ship, the\r\n_Esperance_, but still war was not proclaimed. The French Government\r\nprofessed a wish to keep the peace. Yet at the end of 1755 and the\r\nbeginning of 1756 it marched troops down to the Channel. As the Duke of\r\nNewcastle had succeeded for a time in infecting the nation with his own\r\ncowardice, we were thrown into an unutterably shameful panic by fear\r\nof invasion, though we had a powerful fleet in commission at home, and\r\nthe French had not the means of fitting out a dozen ships at Brest.\r\nUnder cover of this diversion the French invaded Minorca in April. Then\r\nat last the Government was brought to confess that war was war. Our\r\nproclamation appeared on the 17th May, and was answered by the French\r\non the 9th of June.\r\n\r\nThe panic of the country in the early months of 1756 was to some extent\r\njustified. Yet its underlying belief, that if it could only find a\r\nman to rule it had the strength to assert its maritime and colonial\r\nsupremacy, was well founded. In point of mere material force the navy\r\nwas far superior to the French. At the beginning of 1756 we had,\r\nincluding the 50-gun ships which were still counted as fit to lie in\r\na line of battle, 142 liners. The smaller vessels were 125, taking\r\nfrigates and sloops together. When the bombs, fireships, and other\r\ncraft such as hospital ships were included, the total was 320. The\r\nquality of our vessels, though still not all it ought to have been, had\r\nimproved greatly under the new establishment of 1745. The discipline of\r\nthe navy had bettered with the vessels. Some of the old leaven still\r\nremained, and in one respect much was left to be done. We had yet to\r\nlearn how shameful it was that a fine squadron should be paralysed by\r\ndisease as Boscawen’s had been. But we were on the right path. The\r\nintellect of the navy was awake, and was beginning to apply itself to\r\nimproving its armament and its discipline. There was as yet no revolt\r\nagainst the Fighting Orders.\r\n\r\nWant of numbers was the least of the evils which weighed on our enemy.\r\nIn 1754 the navy of France included only 60 line-of-battle ships. Of\r\nthese, 8 were in need of thorough repair, and 4 were still in the\r\nstocks. During the brief administration of M. de Rouille efforts\r\nwere made to reinforce this list. Fifteen new line-of-battle ships\r\nwere launched by 1756. We may suppose that they included the vessels\r\nbuilding in 1754. If the eight in need of repair were thoroughly\r\noverhauled by the same date, this would give France 71 line-of-battle\r\nships. But the French did not include the 50-gun ships, of which they\r\nhad 10, in the list, and they had therefore about 81 vessels to oppose\r\nto our 142. Of ships of 20 to 44 guns they had only some 40 to oppose\r\nto our 83. Their navy was therefore about one-half as numerous as ours.\r\nIt must be remembered that at this time France still held Canada and\r\nimportant stations on the coast of Coromandel. She was under the same\r\nobligations as ourselves to scatter her forces all over the world, and\r\nthat with the prospect of being everywhere outnumbered. With such a\r\ntask to overcome, the French had need of the very highest efficiency in\r\nevery branch of the naval service. But their navy had as much to seek\r\nin quality as in quantity. The corrupt and careless government of Louis\r\nXV. had allowed the storehouses to become nearly empty. During the\r\nyears of peace no attempt had been made to give the officers practice.\r\nIn 1756 it was calculated that of 914 officers 700 had nothing to do\r\nexcept mount guard for twenty-four hours in the dockyards eight or\r\nten times a year. The old feud between the Pen and the Sword—that is,\r\nthe civil and military branches of the navy—raged furiously. On the\r\nships there was mutual hostility between the officers of the regular\r\ncorps and the supplementary officers taken in on the outbreak of war,\r\nand known as _officiers bleus_. None of the corporations of the old\r\nFrench monarchy was more aristocratic or more jealous than the _Corps\r\nde la marine_. The so-called despotic King of France had far less\r\npower of choosing his officers than the constitutional King of Great\r\nBritain. M. de Rouille endeavoured to revive the professional spirit\r\nof the officers, dulled by years of dawdling about the dockyards, by\r\nestablishing the Académie de la marine, with the well-known writer on\r\ntactics, Bigot de Morogue, as its first head. But it was years before\r\nthis could bear fruit, and France began the Seven Years’ War with all\r\nthe conditions internal and external against her. How came it, then,\r\nthat her navy was not mewed up in port at once? The answer is easy.\r\nBecause the British Navy had its arms tied behind its back by the\r\nincapacity of the men who ruled, till Pitt freed it.\r\n\r\nThe first great operation of the war was conducted under a fatal\r\ncombination of administrative stupidity in London and of the old\r\nleaven in the fleet. Reports that the French were preparing a powerful\r\nsquadron at Toulon began to reach England before the end of 1755. The\r\norders to prepare had been given in August, but in the destitution\r\nof the French dockyards eight months passed before it was ready. The\r\nboasted _classes_ failed to produce men, and the French were driven to\r\noffers of bounty, and to attempts to recruit Italian sailors at Genoa.\r\nIt was long before the urgent representations of our Consul at Genoa,\r\nand of General Blakeney at Minorca, could make the Ministry see that\r\nthe island was in danger. Blakeney was a gallant old Anglo-Irishman\r\nborn in 1672, who had fought against the Rapparees in 1690, and served\r\nunder King William and Marlborough, had been at Carthagena with Vernon,\r\nand had defended Stirling Castle against the Jacobites in the ’45. He\r\ncommanded the place, though bedridden with gout, in the absence of Lord\r\nTyrawley the Governor, who according to the easy practice of the day\r\ndrew his salary at home. It was not less characteristic of the time\r\nthat many officers of this threatened garrison were absent on leave\r\nwhen the French invaded the island.\r\n\r\nRichelieu landed with 14,000 men at Ciudadela on the 19th April. After\r\nmany delays and much confusion, the Ministry had at last been brought\r\nto see that Minorca was in danger, and a squadron of ten ships had\r\nsailed to relieve it on the 6th April. The command of the squadron was\r\ngiven to an officer whose name has a tragic interest unique in the long\r\nlist of British admirals. John Byng was the fourth son of that George\r\nByng, Viscount Torrington, whose active subordinate share in the\r\nRevolution of 1688, and command in the Mediterranean in 1718, have been\r\nalready mentioned. The son was born in 1704, and had gone to sea at\r\nthe age of thirteen. He served under his father at the battle of Cape\r\nPassaro, and became post-captain at the age of twenty-three. He had\r\ngained no distinction, nor had he sought any, on those remote unhealthy\r\nstations where the most arduous work of the navy was being done. His\r\nportrait is that of a handsome, refined, but plump and easy-going young\r\nman, and compares ill with his father’s. George Byng has the lean,\r\neager face of one who though of gentle birth had to climb by his own\r\nefforts. John Byng has the air of one whose father was born before\r\nhim, and who did not rise, but was carried up with no effort of his\r\nown by the fortune another had made. He had sat in Parliament, and had\r\nnot escaped the corrupting influence of the factious, selfish, jobbing\r\nspirit of the political world of his generation.\r\n\r\nByng was selected to carry the reliefs to Minorca on the 11th March,\r\nbut nearly a month passed before he sailed. Though we had a great fleet\r\ncommissioned and commissioning, much difficulty was found in manning\r\nthe ten ships assigned him for the service. The Admiralty refused to\r\ndraft men from well-manned vessels on the ground that they were needed\r\nat home. Some part of the blame for this must be put on Anson and\r\nBoscawen, who were on the Board. The great responsibility lay on the\r\nmere politicians and borough-mongers whose folly was paralysing the\r\nstrength of England, but it must be confessed that Anson in dealing\r\nwith political chiefs and colleagues did not show the courage he had\r\nnever failed to display in fighting the storm or the broadsides of the\r\nenemy. As Byng was to reinforce the garrison of Minorca, he carried\r\nwith him both the officers who were at home on leave and Lord Robert\r\nBertie’s regiment of foot. By a piece of blundering, for which Anson\r\ncannot be held blameless, the marines were landed to make room for the\r\nsoldiers. If now they were landed in Minorca, the squadron, already ill\r\nmanned, would have been dangerously weakened. As the French were known\r\nto have a fleet at sea, Byng was thus put at a serious disadvantage,\r\nand an angry sense of ill-treatment rankled in his mind, not\r\nunnaturally, but fatally, for it had a share in causing him to adopt a\r\nline of conduct which brought discredit to his country and a shameful\r\ndeath to himself. It never occurred to him that if he beat the enemy’s\r\nfleet soundly he could safely land the soldiers who had taken the place\r\nof his marines.\r\n\r\nHis orders were dated the 1st April. He was told to sail to the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar. If on arriving there he heard that the French had sent\r\nvessels into the Atlantic bound for America, he was to detach part of\r\nhis squadron under his second in command, Rear-Admiral Temple West, to\r\nfollow them, and proceed with the remainder to Minorca. If he found\r\nthat the island was being attacked, he was to render what help he\r\ncould, and if not, then to blockade Toulon. There is a certain futility\r\nin these orders, for they take no notice of the contingency that even\r\nif Byng was able to beat off the French warships, or found none to\r\nfight, the relief he brought might not be sufficient to enable Blakeney\r\nto resist the troops already landed under Richelieu. But he would do\r\nmuch if he could cut the French off from Toulon, and however feeble the\r\nmeasures of ministers may have been, it was not the less his duty to do\r\nhis utmost. Byng, unhappily for himself, and for us, drew the strange\r\ndeduction, that since he was not supplied with the means of relieving\r\nthe garrison altogether, he was justified in making a feeble use of his\r\nships. Orders were also sent to General Fowke, who was in command at\r\nGibraltar, to spare a part of his garrison for Minorca if he felt that\r\nhe could part with them safely.\r\n\r\nThe voyage out to Gibraltar was tedious. It was not till the 2nd May\r\nthat Byng reached the Rock, where he was joined by Commodore Edgcumbe\r\nwith the =Princess Louisa=, 60, and the =Fortune= sloop, part of a\r\nsmall squadron which had been cruising in the neighbourhood of Minorca\r\nwhen it was invaded. The =Deptford=, 50, and the =Portland=, 50, joined\r\nshortly afterwards. At Gibraltar Byng also heard of the landing of\r\nthe French, of their strength, and of the distressed position of the\r\nEnglish garrison shut up in Fort St. Philip, at the mouth of Mahon\r\nHarbour. On the 4th May he sent off a dispatch which is of extreme\r\nimportance as illustrating the state of mind he was in, and as\r\nexplaining his conduct. In it he says:—\r\n\r\n “If I had been so happy as to have arrived at Mahon before the French\r\n had landed, I flatter myself I would have been able to have prevented\r\n their setting foot on that island; but, as it has so unfortunately\r\n turned out, I am firmly of opinion, from the great force they have\r\n landed, and the quantity of provisions, stores and ammunition of all\r\n kinds they have brought with them, that the throwing men into the\r\n castle, will only enable it to hold out a little longer time, and add\r\n to the number that must fall into the enemy’s hands; for the garrison\r\n in time will be obliged to surrender, unless a sufficient number of\r\n men could be landed to dislodge the French or raise the siege.”\r\n\r\nAfter thus declaring that all efforts must be useless, he promised to\r\ngo on to Minorca to do what he could, and in case it should turn out\r\nto be nothing, then he would return to Gibraltar to cover that place.\r\nThis letter, which was sent home overland, gives the measure of the\r\nman. It may be compared with the letter which Herbert had sent up\r\nto London on first sighting Tourville’s fleet off the Isle of Wight\r\nin 1690. Both men were plainly under the influence of a mischievous\r\ndelight on contemplating the embarrassment which a national disaster\r\nwould be likely to bring on the ministers who had sent them out with\r\ninsufficient fleets. Herbert had the excuse that he was in the presence\r\nof a much superior force. Byng makes no mention of inability to fight\r\nthe French fleet. He was prepared to retire without a battle if he\r\ncould not get security that the French troops would also be driven off\r\nby the reinforcement he had brought, and this he had already declared\r\nto be impossible. In the same letter he speaks of the chance that the\r\nFrench would come on to Gibraltar when they had got all the vessels\r\nready they possibly could. He neither contemplated the possibility of\r\nattempting to beat them in detail before they were all ready, nor the\r\neffect likely to be produced on Richelieu if his communications with\r\nFrance were cut. Yet a strong fort open to relief from the sea might\r\nhave made a prolonged defence, and could have given time for further\r\nreinforcements from England. When they arrived, the total surrender of\r\nthe French would be inevitable. It was natural that when this letter\r\nreached England the Ministry concluded that Byng did not mean to exert\r\nhimself to relieve Minorca, and that foreseeing a disaster, they took\r\nmeasures to turn popular rage against the admiral. They would have been\r\nmore than human if they had not, and Byng was a foolish man indeed if\r\nhe did not know that they were very basely human.\r\n\r\nThe squadron, now increased from ten to thirteen sail, left Gibraltar\r\non the 8th May. General Fowke, with a weakness equal to Byng’s,\r\ndeclined to part with more than 250 men. There had been councils and\r\nconfabulations of weak men, all ending in agreement that the enterprise\r\nwas hopeless. So Byng reluctantly approached “the post of the foe.”\r\nOn the 19th he was in sight of Minorca at the south-easterly point\r\nwhere St. Philip stands at the mouth of the long land-locked harbour\r\nof Mahon. The French fleet was not then in sight. The =Phœnix= frigate\r\ncommanded by Captain Hervey, with the =Chesterfield= and =Dolphin=,\r\nwere sent on ahead with the officers belonging to the garrison, and\r\norders to communicate with General Blakeney. Before they could reach\r\nthe harbour mouth the French fleet was sighted to the south-east,\r\nand Byng recalled the frigates. It was an unnecessary measure, due\r\nto excess of caution, for the frigates were not indispensable to the\r\nfighting power of the fleet, and the military officers they carried\r\nwould have been of great value to the garrison.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day passed in manœuvres, and without a battle. Byng’s\r\nsquadron was outsailed, but he showed no zeal to force on an action,\r\nand confined himself to endeavouring to remain to windward. During\r\nthe night the fleets parted, and at daybreak were not in sight of one\r\nanother. They were from 30 to 40 miles off the island. It was hazy,\r\nbut cleared up about ten, when the enemy was seen a long way off to\r\nthe south-east. The wind was from the south-west. By midday the two\r\nfleets were approaching one another, both close hauled, the French on\r\nthe port, the English on the starboard tack, in two lines forming an\r\nobtuse angle. About one we weathered the head of the French line, and\r\nByng afterwards boasted of having gained the weather-gage. If he did it\r\nby fair sailing, his ships cannot have been so inferior in quality to\r\nthe enemy as he pleaded they were when he had to excuse himself. As\r\nthe French habitually preferred to engage to leeward, which left their\r\nline of retreat open, it is probable that he attributed to his own\r\nskill what was the deliberate act of the enemy. About two o’clock the\r\nEnglish had passed to windward, and to the south of La Galissonière,\r\nour last vessel being nearly abreast of his first. We were thirteen of\r\nthe line, and the French twelve. Being now in the position to force on\r\na battle, Byng brought his fleet round, all ships turning together, so\r\nthat we headed in the same general direction as the French, and ordered\r\nthe =Deptford= to leave the line so that we might be ship to ship\r\nwith the enemy. It was a strange action in an admiral who complained\r\nbitterly of the inferiority of his fleet, but was doubtless due to mere\r\npedantry. Byng, who was a martinet in the fopperies of his profession,\r\nhad no idea of fighting a battle except by the orthodox pattern, van to\r\nvan, centre to centre, rear to rear, and having one ship more than his\r\nopponent, did not know what to do with her. Here are the two fleets in\r\nthe order in which they engaged:—\r\n\r\n ENGLISH\r\n\r\n =Defiance=              60 Capt. Andrews.\r\n =Portland=              50  \"    Baird.\r\n =Lancaster=             60  \"    Edgcumbe.\r\n\r\n =Buckingham=      }\r\n   (flagship of    }     68  \"    Everitt.\r\n   Admiral West)   }\r\n =Captain=               64  \"    Catford.\r\n =Intrepid=              64  \"    Young.\r\n\r\n =Revenge=               64  \"    Cornwall.\r\n\r\n =Princess Louisa=       60  \"    Noel.\r\n =Trident=               64  \"    Durell.\r\n =Ramillies= (flagship}  90  \"    Gardiner.\r\n   of Byng)           }\r\n =Culloden=              74  \"    Ward.\r\n\r\n =Kingston=              60  \"    Parry.\r\n\r\n FRENCH\r\n\r\n _Lion_                  64 Capt. de Saint-Aignan.\r\n _Triton_                64  \"    de Mercier.\r\n _Redoutable_   }\r\n   (flagship of }\r\n   Commodore    }        74  \"    de Vilarzel.\r\n   de Glandèvez)}\r\n _Orphée_                64  \"    de Raymondis.\r\n\r\n _Fier_                  50  \"    d’Herville.\r\n _Guerrier_              74  \"    Villars de\r\n                                    Labrosse.\r\n _Foudroyant_       }\r\n   (flagship of     }    80  \"    Froger de\r\n   La Galissonière) }             l’Eguille.\r\n _Téméraire_             74  \"    de Beaumont\r\n                                  Lemaître.\r\n _Hippopotame_           50  \"    Rochemore.\r\n _Content_               64  \"    de Sabran\r\n                                  Grammont.\r\n _Couronne_ (flagship }\r\n   of Commodore       }  74  \"    Gabanous.\r\n   de La Clue)        }\r\n\r\n _Sage_                  64  \"    Durevest.\r\n\r\nWhen the order to engage was given, the fleets were not parallel, but on\r\nlines converging to form an acute angle ahead of them. Thus the leading\r\nEnglish ship was nearer the leading ship of the French than the rear\r\nwas to their rear. So if each bore down on the Frenchman opposite to\r\nit at the time, the vessels in the van would come into action first,\r\nand would be exposed to a converging fire, while it would depend on the\r\nenemy’s decision to stay still and be attacked, whether the centre and\r\nrear of the English fleet ever got into action at all.\r\n\r\nAdmiral West came down on the Frenchmen briskly, and then hauled up\r\nwith the heads of his ships in the same direction as theirs. Meanwhile\r\nthe other English vessels were steering to come into action while\r\ncarefully preserving their relative positions to the vessels in the\r\nvan. In the French line vessels here and there stood out, and ran to\r\nleeward. Our men cheered, thinking they had forced the enemy to flee,\r\nbut the movement was the result of design. As these vessels ran to\r\nleeward, those astern “let all draw” and shot ahead. Thus a movement\r\nin advance was given to the whole French line, and the distance which\r\nthe English ships of the centre and rear had to cover before reaching\r\ntheir proper opponents was constantly increased. In any case, the\r\nFrench admiral would almost certainly have succeeded in filing past the\r\nleading English vessels, crippling their rigging, and then running down\r\nto form a new line to leeward. But he was helped by a piece of bungling\r\nin our squadron. The =Intrepid=, the sixth ship, lost her foretop-mast.\r\nAs she was before the wind, this ought to have been no great disaster,\r\nbut she was so badly steered that she came right round and lay across\r\nthe path of the following ship—the =Revenge=. According to all rule,\r\ntradition, and honour, the =Revenge= ought to have passed between the\r\ncrippled =Intrepid= and the enemy—that is to leeward. But she tried to\r\npass to windward, could not do so, and then backed her topsail to stop\r\nher way and prevent a collision. The vessels behind did the same thing,\r\nand thus our fleet broke in two. The five ships ahead of the =Intrepid=\r\nfollowed the enemy with Admiral West, while the others remained behind.\r\nIt was about this time that the flag-captain, Gardiner, pointed out\r\nto Byng that if he stood out of his line he could bring the Frenchman\r\nthen running past him to closer action. The admiral answered that\r\nMathews had been broken for not taking his fleet down in a body, and\r\nthat he would not incur the same fate. Rather than offend against the\r\nsuperstition of the line of battle, he would let the enemy get off\r\nunhurt. La Galissonière did get off with little damage, leaving us with\r\nthree ships badly crippled in their rigging, and the whole fleet in\r\nscandalous disorder.\r\n\r\nSo ended the battle of the 20th May. It was first and foremost an\r\nexample of what must happen so long as our navy continued to be bound\r\nby the stupid pattern set up in the Fighting Instructions for all\r\nactions against an enemy of equal, or approximately equal, force—so\r\nlong, in fact, as we continued to engage to windward, ship to ship,\r\nleaving the enemy his line of retreat open, and depriving ourselves of\r\nthe power to push the attack home, by making it a rule to adhere to the\r\nformation in which we began the fight. In these conditions decisive\r\nresults were not to be achieved. But Byng did ill even according to\r\nthis stupid model. He ought to have arranged his fleet parallel to the\r\nenemy before he bore down, and he ought not to have begun firing, as\r\nhe did, when at such a distance that he could do no harm. Yet the lame\r\nand impotent conclusion of the battle and his own bungling might both\r\nhave been forgiven, or even passed unnoticed, but for what followed.\r\nThe fleet was satisfied that it had made the enemy run, and the nation\r\nwould have been satisfied too, if there had been any effort to help\r\nFort St. Philip in the days following the battle. There was none.\r\nFor four days Byng loitered near the scene of the action, repairing\r\nthe vessels crippled on the 20th. He said it was not easy to do, and\r\nindeed, from first to last, showed a marked disinclination to attempt\r\nanything that was not “easy.” Then a council of war came to the\r\nconclusion, which is always so welcome to weak men weakly led, that\r\nnothing more could be done. The fleet returned to “cover” Gibraltar,\r\nleaving Minorca to its fate. Before the complacent dispatch in which\r\nByng announced his decision could reach home, the news of the failure\r\nhad been given by La Galissonière’s boastful letter to his own king. It\r\nwas published in Paris, and sent on from thence. In truth the French\r\nadmiral was very nervous, constantly expecting the reappearance of the\r\nEnglish in superior force, and was only kept from retiring to Toulon by\r\nthe incessant driving of Richelieu. The honour both of the defence and\r\nof the attack in this campaign belongs wholly to the soldiers. When the\r\nresult of the meeting of the two fleets was known, there burst out a\r\nstorm of rage of which the echoes can be heard to this day. It is not\r\npleasant to hear a people howling for the life of a man, whether he be\r\nthe great and terrible Strafford or poor, weak, self-satisfied John\r\nByng. The manifestations, too, were vulgar. The mob hanged the admiral\r\nin effigy, the City of London sent deputations asking for his life, the\r\nPrime Minister gabbled promises that he should be punished. Meanwhile\r\nByng had returned to Gibraltar on the 19th June. He found there a\r\nreinforcement of five line-of-battle ships under Commodore Brodrick,\r\nwho had arrived on the 15th from England. Preparations were being made\r\nto return to Mahon when Hawke came into Gibraltar to take command and\r\nalso to send Byng home for trial together with the witnesses. Fowke was\r\nalso recalled. The admiral heard of his supersession with unaffected,\r\nor at any rate with remarkably well-simulated, indignation. He wrote\r\na furious self-laudatory letter on the 4th July, all but claiming a\r\nstatue for his exertions. On the 9th July he sailed a prisoner in the\r\n=Antelope=, and reached England on the 19th August.\r\n\r\nHe was first imprisoned at Greenwich, and then sent to Portsmouth for\r\ntrial. In the sentimental reaction of coming years, it was said that he\r\ncould not expect fair treatment in the prevailing rage of the nation,\r\nand that he was made a sacrifice by base-minded politicians. But nobody\r\ncan read the minutes of the court martial without seeing that the\r\nadmiral had a perfectly fair trial, and was condemned on his merits,\r\nwhile the politicians who had an interest in securing his condemnation\r\nhad left office before the court martial began, and remained out till\r\nafter his execution. Newcastle had been replaced by the first short\r\nadministration of Pitt. The court martial began to sit on the 17th\r\nDecember 1756, and sentence was given on the 28th February 1757. The\r\ncourt found that the admiral had offended against the 12th Article in\r\nthat he had not done his utmost against the enemy. Therefore, though\r\nit acquitted him of cowardice or disaffection, it found him guilty of\r\nnegligence, and condemned him to the only punishment it was authorised\r\nto inflict, which was death. Attempts were made to save his life. The\r\nHouse of Commons even passed a Bill to relieve the officers forming the\r\ncourt martial from the obligation to preserve secrecy as to what had\r\npassed in their private decision on the sentence. It was hoped that\r\nthey might have something to say which would avail the prisoner, but\r\nwhen questioned by the House of Lords they could answer nothing to the\r\npurpose. The Upper House rejected the Bill, and the admiral was shot\r\nto death on the deck of the =Monarque= on the 14th March 1757. He died\r\nwith dignity, and protesting to the last he had been made a victim.\r\n\r\nIn the changes of things and in the usual reaction by which Englishmen\r\nhabitually atone for the fury of their rage, he came indeed to be\r\nthought of as a victim, yet the sentence was just. Coward, in the sense\r\nthat he suffered from the pitiable cowardice which makes a man sick and\r\ngiddy at the approach of personal danger, he was not. Neither was he\r\ndisaffected, in the sense that he was scheming to upset the Government\r\nhe served. As these were the forms of cowardice and disaffection\r\ncontemplated by the Act, the court very properly acquitted him under\r\nthese heads. But he was a coward in the intellectual sense. Having a\r\ndangerous piece of work to do, and one in which the very errors of\r\nthe Government rendered it only the more incumbent on him to make all\r\nwants good by his own exertions, he thought chiefly of doing it at\r\nthe least risk, and was resigned to failure. The excuses he made were\r\npitiable. All through he insisted on the inferiority of his fleet.\r\nYet he had thirteen ships to twelve. It is true that the French were\r\nbetter vessels, the _Foudroyant_ with her 80 guns, for instance, being\r\nsuperior in real strength to the =Ramillies= with her 90. Yet the\r\n_Foudroyant_ afterwards surrendered to a much smaller ship than the\r\n=Ramillies=. He harped on the lesser weight of his guns, and it is true\r\nthat the 42-pounders carried on the lower deck of some French ships\r\nwere heavier than any of ours. Yet he had 834 guns to the Frenchman’s\r\n806, and the 42-pounder was afterwards rejected from our navy as too\r\nlumbering for ship-work. All through he kept insisting on the risk of\r\ndoing this or that, till he brought upon himself the scathing answer\r\nof Blakeney: “I have served these sixty-three years, and I never knew\r\nany enterprise undertaken without some danger; and this might have been\r\neffected with as little danger as any I ever knew.” It was monstrous\r\nthat men should think they could make war without hazard. Therefore\r\nthe court justly found Byng guilty of “negligence,”—that is to say,\r\nall that deficiency to do enough, all that hanging back from strenuous\r\neffort, which are due to want of spirit, to a selfish regard of what\r\nthe soft-minded man thinks are the interests of his safety, to the\r\nmoral cowardice which falls short of mere physical poltroonery, and the\r\ndisaffection which stops on this side of deliberate treason. The law\r\nhad been made stern after the experience of the last war. Byng knew the\r\nconditions of his servitude. They were in the Act by which he exercised\r\nhis own authority, and he sinned against the light.\r\n\r\nBrutal as the wrath of the nation was, it was founded on a sound\r\nsentiment. If England was to take her place in the world, there had to\r\nbe an end of Mathews and Lestock, of Peyton, Griffin, and Cornelius\r\nMitchell. Voltaire’s famous jest that the English shot an admiral to\r\nencourage the others suffers from the worst defect a scoff can have.\r\nHe meant it for a _reductio ad absurdum_. It was a perfectly accurate\r\nstatement of fact. The shooting of Byng did encourage the others.\r\nHenceforward there might be errors and stupidities, and failures here\r\nand there. So there always will be while men remain men, but a service\r\nis to be judged by its general spirit, and by the view it takes of\r\nerrors and failures. Nobody who looks critically at the history of\r\nthe British Navy in the eighteenth century can fail to note a vast\r\ndifference between the years before and those after 1757. And we insult\r\nthe memory of the seamen of the eighteenth century if we suppose that\r\nthis is so only because the wrath of the nation drove them to greater\r\nexertion, or that they did not think the execution of Byng just. Some\r\ndid not. His second in command, Temple West, resigned rather than\r\ncontinue to serve if he was to be liable to punishment for “an error of\r\njudgment.” West by the use of that phrase gave currency to a sophism\r\nwhich has often been used to obscure the real significance of this\r\ngreat sacrifice. But the navy had not protested against the change in\r\nthe Naval Discipline Act of 1749. The officers who tried Byng did not\r\nshrink from applying the law though it cut them to the heart to send a\r\nbrother in arms to a shameful death. If they had been dishonest men,\r\nthey might have acquitted him of negligence, but they saw the truth\r\nand they did their terrible duty. There is nothing to show that the\r\nseamen, whether on the quarter-deck or before the mast, did, as a body,\r\nthink the sentence unjust. Indeed, the whole navy was now burning with\r\na spirit which asked for nothing better than to be relieved of such\r\nleadership as Byng’s.\r\n\r\nThree months after the admiral met his fate, the great administration\r\nof the elder Pitt was formed. At last the power of England was about\r\nto be directed, not by pettifogging and parliamentary intrigue, but by\r\ngenius and passion. Yet the full effect of the change could not be felt\r\nfor a space, and until 1758 was well advanced the work of Newcastle\r\nmay be said to overlap that of Pitt. We may look for a moment at the\r\ninterval before the power of the navy was fully free to act.\r\n\r\nWhen Hawke superseded Byng in July 1756 it was too late to save\r\nMinorca, and no means were at hand for its recovery. He cruised\r\nunopposed by the French till December, and then returned home, leaving\r\nthe command to Admiral Saunders. The interest on both sides was\r\ncentred now in North America. The French had to reinforce and support\r\ntheir colonies. Our aim was to intercept their succours, and to make\r\nourselves masters of the French port at the mouth of the St. Lawrence,\r\nas preparatory to the conquest of Canada. At home our Channel fleet\r\nwas to watch Brest, and our Mediterranean fleet to keep a check on\r\nToulon; while in America preparations were making to attack Cape Breton\r\nupon the arrival of a naval force from England. The work of watching\r\nthe French ports was not uniformly well done. In April a squadron of\r\nfour sail under the command of M. Durevest escaped Saunders in the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar after a slight brush, and held on to America. In\r\nMay, Vice-Admiral Henry Osborn came out with reinforcements, and took\r\nover the command. The total force was thirteen of the line and two\r\n50-gun ships, a much larger force than the French ships at Toulon could\r\nhope to face in open battle. Osborn was a good representative of that\r\nlarge body of naval officers whose names are associated with no single\r\naction of great renown, but who did much and varied service, and who\r\ncontributed to the glory of more fortunate rivals by weary cruising\r\nand vigilant watch far away from the scene where more brilliant\r\nreputations were being earned. He was also a very typical officer of\r\nhis time, when the life of the chief was one of stern solitude, and\r\nhis exercise of authority was harsh. By nature Osborn was of a cold,\r\nsaturnine disposition. He made no friends, and if he did not actively\r\nmake enemies his hand weighed on all under his command with oppressive\r\nseverity. But his vigilance, his strenuous discharge of duty, and\r\nhis severe exaction of their utmost from his subordinates fitted him\r\nadmirably for the work he had to do in the Mediterranean, in 1757 and\r\nthe early months of 1758.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Minorca imposed a heavy disadvantage on the British admiral\r\nwho had to watch Toulon. The nearest port at which vessels could be\r\ndocked was Gibraltar, and this was a serious consideration before\r\nthe use of copper sheathing had been introduced, and when ships grew\r\nrapidly foul. In December, when Osborn was at the Rock, M. de la Clue\r\nleft Toulon with five sail of the line and one 50-gun ship, in the\r\nhope that he might elude his opponent and follow Durevest to America.\r\nBut Osborn was on the watch in the Straits, and La Clue put into the\r\nSpanish port of Carthagena. Here he was watched rather than blockaded.\r\nTwo more liners and a frigate succeeded in slipping in and joining him.\r\nOn the 5th February 1758 he put out to meet reinforcements promised\r\nhim from Toulon, and went as far as Palos; but his friends did not\r\nappear, and fearing to have the whole British squadron on his hands,\r\nhe returned to Carthagena. On the 25th February a reinforcement did\r\nappear off the port. It consisted of the _Foudroyant_, 80, commanded\r\nby Captain Duquesne, who had with him the _Orphée_, 64, and the\r\n_Oriflamme_, 50. Duquesne declined to come within the island of\r\nEscombrera, which lies at the mouth of Carthagena harbour, and waited\r\noutside to be joined by La Clue. A squall drove him to sea, where\r\nhis little squadron was sighted, scattered, and chased by Osborn. The\r\n_Orphée_ struck to the =Revenge= and the =Berwick=. The _Oriflamme_\r\nwas driven on shore, but succeeded in getting off and joining La Clue\r\nin Carthagena. A noble story is connected with the fortunes of the\r\n_Foudroyant_.\r\n\r\nAmong the ships under Admiral Osborn’s command was the =Monmouth=, 64,\r\na poor little liner of our starved model, but a quick sailer. She was\r\ncommanded by Arthur Gardiner, who had been flag-captain to Byng in\r\nthe miserable battle of Minorca, and his first lieutenant was Robert\r\nCarkett, one of those officers who rose from before the mast. Little\r\nis known of Gardiner, save that he had been chosen by Byng to be his\r\nflag-captain, which implies that he was a “follower” of his admiral and\r\nwas under obligations to him. In the battle he had given Byng good and\r\nmanly advice, and in the court martial his evidence had told severely\r\nagainst his chief. The memory of that day had rankled in Gardiner’s\r\nmind. Now La Galissonière’s flag had flown in the _Foudroyant_ in\r\nthe battle, and the English captain had come to regard her with a\r\nconcentrated hatred. He is reported to have said that whenever he\r\nmet her he would attack her, at all odds, and either take her or\r\nperish. Charnock, to whom the traditions of the navy of that time came\r\ndirectly, quotes a letter telling how “Two days before he left his port\r\n(viz. Gibraltar) being in company with Lord Robert Bertie, and other\r\npersons, he with great anguish of soul told them, that my Lord Anson\r\nhad reflected on him, and said he was one of the men who had brought\r\ndisgrace upon the nation; that it touched him excessively, but it\r\nran strongly in his mind, that he should have an opportunity shortly\r\nto convince his lordship how much he had the honour of the nation at\r\nheart, and that he was not culpable.”\r\n\r\nWhen now, on the morning of the 28th February 1758, Gardiner found\r\nhimself among the chasing ships of Osborn’s squadron, and saw the\r\nFrench ships in flight, he singled out the mighty _Foudroyant_, and\r\ncrowded sail in pursuit. The =Swiftsure= and the =Hampton Court=\r\naccompanied him, but they were heavy sailers and soon fell behind.\r\nThe chase began early in the morning, and was prolonged till evening,\r\nwhen the _Foudroyant_ and the =Monmouth= were alone. As he pressed\r\non the chase, Captain Gardiner, so tradition recorded by Charnock\r\ntells, said to a military officer who was with him, “Whatever becomes\r\nof you and me, this ship (pointing presumably at the _Foudroyant_)\r\nmust go into Gibraltar.” Also he called his crew aft, and said, “That\r\nship must be taken, she appears above our match, but Englishmen are\r\nnot to mind that, nor will I quit her while this ship can swim, or\r\nI have a soul left alive.” Finding that he could not shake off his\r\npursuer, and feeling not unreasonably confident that the other English\r\nships were too far off to act against him, Captain Duquesne turned\r\non the =Monmouth=. If M. Troude, the most careful historian of the\r\nFrench Navy, is right, the _Foudroyant_ suffered from a weakness which\r\nwas infinitely dishonourable. Her crew was so mutinous that Captain\r\nDuquesne could not use the guns of his second deck. The men ran below\r\nvery soon after the action began. This goes far to explain the action.\r\nThe _Foudroyant_, a larger vessel than our three-deckers of the time,\r\ncarried a broadside at least twice as heavy as the =Monmouth’s=,\r\nand ought, if properly handled, to have made a wreck of her in two\r\nbroadsides. The bad conduct of Duquesne’s men does not diminish in any\r\nway the credit due to Captain Gardiner, who could not know how ill\r\nhis opponent would be supported, and it does go to prove the moral\r\ninferiority of the French Navy at that period. The engagement began\r\nabout seven o’clock between these two opponents so ill matched in\r\nmaterial strength, and lasted till about midnight before help came to\r\nthe =Monmouth=. Her mizen-mast was shot away and about a hundred of her\r\nmen fell killed or wounded, but the mainmast of the bulky Frenchman\r\nwas brought down on the fore, and he became an unmanageable wreck. At\r\nlast the =Swiftsure= and the =Hampton Court= came up, guided by the\r\nsound of the cannon, and at one in the morning Duquesne surrendered,\r\ninsisting, with chivalrous politeness, on giving up his sword to the\r\nofficer commanding the =Monmouth=. This was not now Captain Gardiner.\r\nHe had been wounded early in the action, but refused to leave the\r\ndeck. Later he was mortally struck, and handed over the command to\r\nLieutenant Carkett with a last exhortation not to let go his hold of\r\nthe Frenchman. He died with the supreme consolation of knowing that no\r\none could ever again accuse him of disgracing his country.\r\n\r\nLa Clue remained at Carthagena till he found an opportunity to slip\r\nout and escape to Toulon in April. The attempt to send help to North\r\nAmerica had broken down before the watch of the English admiral. It\r\nwas Osborn’s last service. An attack of paralysis reduced him to the\r\nnecessity of coming home in July. He was thanked by the House of\r\nCommons, and acknowledged its thanks in the words which sound best in\r\nthe ears of Englishmen, protesting that he had done no more than his\r\nduty, and hoping that his services might be “the most inconsiderable\r\nthat shall be thus honoured.” The command in the Mediterranean devolved\r\non Admiral Brodrick, but the war in that sea died down till it revived\r\nin the _annus mirabilis_ of 1759.\r\n\r\nThe share of the work thrown on the Channel fleet was not so\r\nsuccessfully done. Until the superiority of the navy had been more\r\nfully established, and St. Vincent had organised his system of\r\nsleepless blockade, winter and summer, Brest was a bad port to watch,\r\nopening as it does on the wide and stormy Atlantic, not, as Toulon\r\ndoes, on the fierce and fickle but not formidable Mediterranean. In\r\nJanuary of 1757 M. de Beauffremont left Brest for America with a\r\nsquadron. It was too early to venture to enter the St. Lawrence, and\r\nhe sailed first for the West Indies. Thence he made his way to Cape\r\nBreton in June, carrying with him a large convoy of merchant ships. At\r\nCape Breton he found M. Durevest with the four vessels which had eluded\r\nAdmiral Saunders in April. Another reinforcement joined him under\r\nthe command of M. Dubois de Lamotte, who had left Brest on the 3rd\r\nMay with nine sail of the line. The total force under Beauffremont’s\r\ncommand now amounted to eighteen sail of the line and five frigates.\r\nAn admirable opportunity was offered him of doing some service, but\r\nhe effected nothing of the active order. His mere presence on the\r\ncoast had put a stop for the time to a scheme of Lord Loudoun for an\r\nattack on Louisbourg. In so far he did some good to his side in a\r\npassive way, and with that he was content. And with that he continued\r\nto be content. Admiral Holburne sailed from St. Helen’s on the 16th\r\nApril, picked up some troops at Cork, and reached Halifax in July.\r\nHis purpose was to join with Lord Loudoun and the colonial forces in\r\nan attack on Louisbourg. But the French were judged to be in too great\r\nstrength to allow of success, and the combined operation was given up.\r\nAdmiral Holburne, with his fleet of sixteen sail of the line and three\r\nfrigates, paraded past Louisbourg in August and dared Beauffremont\r\nto battle. But the Frenchman would not come out. Holburne returned\r\nto Halifax, was reinforced by four sail of the line, and resumed the\r\nblockade of Louisbourg, but on the 24th of September a hurricane of\r\nextraordinary violence scattered his fleet, and he was blown home. The\r\nmost severely damaged vessels were sent back at once. The admiral came\r\non with the others, and the trade from Halifax. When the coast was\r\nclear Beauffremont came out at the end of October, and reached Brest in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nWe are now at the end of the preliminary period of the Seven Years’\r\nWar, and on the eve of the great campaigns which left the Royal Navy\r\nthe uncontested mistress of the seas, and Great Britain the dominating\r\npower in Asia and America. A few words may be devoted to the moral and\r\nintellectual qualities of the two navies opposed to one another. It\r\nwill be seen that from 1755 till well in 1758 our operations had not\r\non the whole been successfully conducted. But when we look close it\r\nappears that, except in the notorious case of Byng, the fault lay with\r\nthe rulers who did not use the fleet with vigour. In one respect the\r\nnavy had still a good deal to learn. Its blockades were not maintained\r\nwith the severity of later times. Our admirals, or perhaps it was\r\nrather My Lords at the Admiralty, shrank from the risks of a blockade\r\nof Brest in winter and spring. But even in the Mediterranean the method\r\nof conducting a blockade inevitably diminished its effect. A fleet\r\nwas kept together outside an enemy’s port till it was all in want of\r\nwater and a refit. Then it was taken back in a body, with the result\r\nthat for the time being the blockade was raised. In the Mediterranean\r\nthis was of less importance, because there always remained the chance\r\nof catching the enemy in the Straits. Yet the temporary absence of\r\nour fleet allowed M. de la Clue to escape first from Toulon, and then\r\nfrom Carthagena. On the ocean this periodical raising of the blockade\r\nrendered any effectual watch in Brest impossible. Yet our navy did,\r\nin the main, endeavour to keep close to the enemy’s ports in order to\r\nbe in a position to attack him whenever he came out, and the aim it\r\nsteadily pursued was to bring on battle with the French and beat their\r\nsquadrons at sea. So it gained steadily in skill by prolonged cruising,\r\nand it grew no less steadily in confidence and daring.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the French we find a great difference. With them the\r\nconstant aim was to fight as little as might be when fighting was\r\nnecessary, and to achieve their purpose without fighting, if possible.\r\nLa Galissonière did not follow up his success against Byng, though\r\nhe had ocular demonstration of the clumsiness and timidity of his\r\nopponent. Beauffremont had declined battle with Holburne, though\r\nnumbers were on his side. Yet the French spoke of the glory of La\r\nGalissonière, and Beauffremont was held to have done right. It would\r\nbe a very silly national vanity which sought the explanation of the\r\ndifference in any want of personal courage among the French. Though a\r\nnervous and excitable they are a valiant people, and the history of\r\ntheir navy is full of the heroic fights of individual ships against\r\nlong odds. What explains their inferiority in enterprise is the\r\nprinciple upon which they acted. It has been stated with simplicity\r\nby one of their writers on the art of war at sea, Ramatuelle. He says\r\ngravely that the French Navy did not aim at destroying a few of the\r\nenemy’s ships, but at a more serious object, namely, the execution\r\nof its mission. On the face of it this seems absurd, for what more\r\nserious object can any fleet have than to defeat its opponent and make\r\nitself master at sea? The French answered, that given the great number\r\nof the English warships it was idle to suppose that they would ever\r\nbe destroyed wholly in battle, and that they themselves would be worn\r\nout long before a decisive result could be obtained. Therefore when a\r\nFrench admiral sailed to relieve a colony, or save some particular post\r\nfrom attack, or land men to be used against a British possession, he\r\nwas to avoid battle as far as he could, and if forced to fight then to\r\nengage to leeward, cripple as many as he could of the enemy’s spars,\r\nand slip away. In short, his aim was always to keep his own fleet\r\nintact, and not to destroy the enemy’s. There is a superficial air of\r\ningenuity about all this, but it was in the long run a fatal method of\r\nconducting wars. It left us free to direct our blows where we pleased.\r\nIt made it certain that our fleets would never be seriously crippled.\r\nIt made it inevitable that sooner or later we would break down the\r\nFrench defence, since that which attacks and wears away will always in\r\nthe end break through a passive opposition. But its worst consequence\r\nwas the degrading moral effect it had. The French Navy was taught that\r\nto be brought to battle was a misfortune, and thus it came to have a\r\npredisposition to give way, to avoid, to seek shelter, to run. We grew\r\naccustomed to look upon our opponent as one who feared our blows, and\r\nto take it for granted that the French would never stand in the face\r\nof an equal force. The working of these two widely different ideals of\r\nconduct will be seen in the following years of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE YEARS OF TRIUMPH\r\n\r\n AUTHORITY.—See last Chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe privateer who plays so conspicuous a part in the maritime history\r\nof France is but a dim and subordinate figure beside the great\r\ndisciplined and triumphant navy of this country. We can generally\r\nafford to neglect him and his doings altogether. Yet in the Seven\r\nYears’ War he does for one moment come forward in a manner so\r\ncharacteristic and instructive, that we may look at him very briefly\r\nbefore turning to the operations of honest warfare. Ever since the\r\nreign of Henry VIII. it had been the custom to favour these skimmers\r\nof the sea in Acts for the Encouragement of Seamen, which invited\r\nall sorts and conditions of men to set out armed ships to plunder\r\nthe enemy. In the age of Elizabeth their part was honourable, for\r\nthe privateers then were often gallant gentlemen—Raleigh or the Earl\r\nof Cumberland—who fitted out warships against the national enemy, as\r\ntheir ancestors had raised bands of spearmen and archers to follow King\r\nEdward or King Harry. But as the State grew in power and resources,\r\nsuch men found their proper place in the regular forces. The privateer\r\ntended more and more to become a mere vulgar plunderer. His competition\r\nwith the navy for men had made him a nuisance, as far back as the time\r\nof the Commonwealth. The private ship with its slovenly discipline,\r\nand the greater chances of earning booty it offered, attracted all\r\nthe restless spirits to whom the order of the navy was grievous. “A\r\nregular built privateer” became the naval officer’s phrase for a dirty,\r\nill-managed, inefficient ship. The last great age of the privateer\r\nwas the War of the Austrian Succession, when the navy was bad and\r\nincapable of blocking the enemy’s ports. In the Seven Years’ War, when\r\nthe navy was equal to its work, the innate tendency of men, whose sole\r\naim was plunder, to sink into mere pirates was rapidly shown. As French\r\ncommerce soon disappeared off the sea, the privateers were driven to\r\nchoose between starvation and the robbery of neutrals or even of their\r\nown countrymen. They made the choice which might have been expected of\r\nthem. Very soon the outrages of the privateers in the Channel became a\r\ndownright pest. They took to boarding neutral vessels, and to extorting\r\nbooty or blackmail. At last the complaints of friendly states drove the\r\nBritish Government to adopt vigorous measures of repression. Extreme\r\noffenders found their way to Execution Dock, and in 1759 an Act was\r\npassed limiting the right to receive a “letter of marque” to vessels\r\nof over one hundred tons, belonging to owners who could give some\r\nguarantee of good conduct. An exception was made for small vessels\r\nbelonging to the Channel Islands, which did some useful piloting and\r\nscouting work. The privateers are only mentioned here because the\r\nmeasures taken to restrain them show that the navy was growing in power\r\nto discharge its proper function, and that the country was coming to\r\nrealise that it ought to leave the duty of representing it on the sea\r\nto a disciplined force with a code of honour.\r\n\r\nIt has been said already that some time passed, after the formation\r\nof Pitt’s great ministry in June 1757, before the naval and military\r\npowers of the country could be co-ordinated for definite and profitable\r\npurposes. One of the uses to which they were put reflects little\r\nhonour on the sagacity of the Great Commoner. He reverted to futile\r\nexpeditions against the coast of France. By the inevitable working of\r\nunvarying conditions these revivals of old errors produced identical\r\nresults. They do not deserve that more time should be spent on them\r\nthan is necessary to record that they took place, and came to an\r\nunavoidable failure. In September of 1757 Hawke sailed with a strong\r\nsquadron, carrying a detachment of troops under General Mordaunt, for\r\nthe purpose of taking Rochefort. He sailed on the 8th of that month,\r\nand by the 6th October he was back, and Rochefort was not taken. We\r\ndid plunder the poor little island of Aix, and that was all—all\r\nexcept the ensuing court of inquiry and wrangle. Yet it was decided to\r\nmake another and more serious effort next year, for Pitt clung with\r\npersistence to this part of his military policy. His critics called it\r\nbreaking windows with guineas, but he valued it for two reasons. He\r\nhoped that the pressure on their coast would constrain the French to\r\nwithdraw part of their troops from Germany where they were threatening\r\nthe king’s electorate of Hanover, and were weighing on our ally the\r\nKing of Prussia. It was a bad reason, for if an effectual diversion\r\nwas to be made we ought to have landed a substantial army, capable of\r\nestablishing itself in France. The second and perhaps better reason was\r\ngiven in 1759 by Captain Hervey of the =Monmouth=, who was serving in\r\nthe Brest blockade, under Hawke, when he landed on the little island\r\nof Molines and levied a contribution on the inhabitants. The priest\r\nappealed to him to spare their poverty, and Captain Hervey answered,\r\n“That he was sorry to distress the poor inhabitants, but what he now\r\ndid was to show the enemy and all Europe that the French could not\r\nprotect their people in their own sight, much less dare the invasion of\r\nEngland.” After the shameful panic of 1756, there was something to be\r\nsaid for the policy of showing that our fleets could sweep along the\r\nFrench coast, and that the enemy would not dare to give them battle.\r\nThis purpose at least was achieved to the full by the great combined\r\nexpedition which made three sorties in 1758. A fleet of twenty-four\r\nsail of the line under Anson convoyed 14,000 troops under the Duke\r\nof Marlborough to St. Malo in June. The place proved too strong, and\r\nthe expedition came back to the Isle of Wight. A scheme for attacking\r\nCherbourg was defeated by a storm, and the expedition returned. The\r\nDuke of Marlborough was now replaced by General Bligh, a veteran called\r\nover from Ireland to take up the “buccaneering” work when officers\r\nof more interest had come to regard it with weary disgust. A second\r\nsortie was made, and Cherbourg was taken on the 6th August. This was\r\nour only genuine success, for several privateers were destroyed and\r\nsome guns were brought away. As it was thought that more might have\r\nbeen done, the expedition sailed on its third sortie in September to\r\nmake another attempt on St. Malo. But by this time we had achieved\r\nour purpose of inducing the French to withdraw troops from Germany and\r\nlook to their own coast. The soldiers landed to invest the town were\r\nassailed by superior numbers, and driven to re-embark in the Bay of St.\r\nCas with heavy loss. The military management was not good, but no skill\r\ncould have secured success. The naval work of transport and convoy was\r\nthoroughly well executed.\r\n\r\nIt is a satisfaction to be able to turn to scenes where the navy\r\nwas more effectually employed. In March of 1758 a squadron of small\r\nvessels, under the command of Captain Holmes, drove a French and\r\nAustrian garrison out of Embden, a port belonging to our ally the King\r\nof Prussia. This was a most useful piece of service, since it helped\r\nus to retain the power to land soldiers on the continent for the\r\ndefence of Hanover and the prosecution of the war in Germany. In the\r\nfollowing month of April Hawke was allowed to use a squadron in a way\r\nmuch better calculated to convince the French of our superiority at\r\nsea, and of their inability to invade, than any number of mere sporadic\r\nraids on their coast, since it gave them no chance of retaliating as\r\nthey did in the Bay of St. Cas. Pitt, who was always well informed of\r\nthe enemy’s movements, learnt early in the year that a great convoy\r\nwas being prepared in the Basque Roads for America, and was to sail\r\nunder protection of a small squadron. Hawke was sent to intercept it\r\nwith seven sail of the line and three frigates. He found five French\r\nline-of-battle ships and several frigates, with forty merchant ships\r\ncarrying 3000 troops to reinforce the American garrisons, starting or\r\nabout to start from the Basque Roads and the Pertuis d’Antioche, the\r\nanchorages on the mainland just opposite the islands of Oléron and Ré.\r\nBetween the 4th and 6th of April he broke up the convoy and drove it\r\ninto the mud. In their anxiety to escape to Rochefort up the Charente\r\nthe Frenchmen threw their guns overboard and started their water to\r\nlighten the ships. When it is remembered that they were five to seven,\r\nand on their own coasts, the prompt flight of the French liners speaks\r\naloud of the little spirit of their navy at this period.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of the same month of April Captain John Campbell of the\r\n=Essex=, 64, and a fireship, the =Pluto=, Captain James Hume, fell\r\nin with and scattered a convoy of twelve French merchant ships from\r\nBordeaux under protection of a frigate and a large privateer. The two\r\narmed ships were taken after a resistance which cost Captain Hume his\r\nlife. Such pieces of service as these were not glorious, but they were\r\ntypical examples of the work done by the fleet to sweep the enemy off\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nFar beyond the waters of Europe the navy was beginning to apply itself\r\nto the task of rooting out the French settlements. The operations of\r\n1758 were preparatory for the great undertaking of the following year;\r\none of them makes us acquainted with the oddest figure of all this war,\r\nthe Quaker Thomas Cumming. This man was a trader on the west coast\r\nof Africa, who had elaborated a scheme for expelling the French from\r\nall their stations. When asked how he reconciled his active share in\r\nhostilities with his religious principles, he answered with ingenious\r\ncasuistry by saying, that if his scheme had been executed with the\r\nforce he thought necessary there would have been no resistance, and\r\ntherefore no fighting. Mr. Cumming had been busy from early in 1757 in\r\nurging his ideas on Ministers, but it was not till he secured a hearing\r\nfrom Pitt and in the following year that he saw his advice put in\r\npractice, though on a smaller scale than he wished. In the interval a\r\nFrench squadron, commanded by M. de Kersaint, had made an unsuccessful\r\nattack on Cape Coast Castle. This event may have served to awaken\r\nministers to the need there was for putting our settlements on a safer\r\nfooting. The fortunes of M. de Kersaint may be followed for the sake\r\nof one name with which they make us acquainted, and also because they\r\nshow how wide-ranging are the movements of war at sea. Having failed at\r\nCape Coast Castle the French officer stood across the Atlantic to the\r\nWest Indies. At Cape Français, now called Cape Haytiën, in Hispaniola,\r\nhe was engaged on convoy work, when he had an action with a British\r\nsquadron under Commodore Forrest on the 21st October. The English and\r\nFrench accounts cannot be reconciled. According to our version three\r\nof our ships engaged most gallantly with a much stronger French force\r\nand got the better of them. Our story runs that M. de Kersaint, having\r\nshown a disposition to engage, Commodore Forrest consulted his two\r\nsubordinate captains, and one of them answered that it would be a\r\npity to disappoint the Frenchman. The officer to whom this spirited\r\nreply is attributed was Captain Maurice Suckling, to whom we owe the\r\nintroduction into the navy of the heir of all its past labours, and the\r\nmost famous of all its chiefs, his nephew, Horatio Nelson. The action\r\nneed not be discussed. It was counted a gallant affair long before\r\nNelson, with whom it was always a cherished memory and the 21st October\r\na fateful day, was known to fame. Beyond confirming our growing sense\r\nof superiority to the French it produced no effect, for the convoy got\r\naway. If, as the French deny, M. de Kersaint was in much greater force,\r\nhe no doubt acted on the rule of his service described above, and threw\r\naway his chance of overpowering the three British ships in order to\r\nfulfil his mission to see the merchant vessels safe to port.\r\n\r\nIt was in March 1758 that Mr. Cummings saw his idea put into practice.\r\nA small squadron, under Captain Henry Marsh, sailed on the 9th of that\r\nmonth, carrying the Quaker with it. On the 30th April (the month in\r\nwhich Hawke scattered the French convoy in the Basque Roads), St. Louis\r\nde Senegal was taken, and the supply of slaves for the French colonies\r\nmuch reduced. An attack on the island of Gorée in May failed, and then\r\nthe commodore sent on to the West Indies with the trade, which in plain\r\nEnglish meant the kidnapped negroes.\r\n\r\nSo far the enterprise had been successful enough to encourage a\r\nrepetition and to earn Mr. Cummings “the gratification of a handsome\r\npension.” It was decided to complete the conquest begun by Commodore\r\nMarsh. The officer chosen for the task was Keppel. On the 26th October\r\nhe sailed from Cork with four line-of-battle ships, one 50-gun ship,\r\nsix smaller vessels, and a body of troops. He was driven back by bad\r\nweather, but started finally on the 11th November. On the way out\r\nthe 50-gun ship, the =Lichfield=, was lost on the coast of Morocco.\r\nThe loss was of no great importance to the squadron, but it is to be\r\nmentioned because we afterwards, and that at a time when Pitt took\r\na tone of haughty superiority to the civilised powers of Europe,\r\ncondescended to pay the bloodstained savage, whom we termed Emperor of\r\nMorocco, a heavy ransom to save the crew from slavery. It was one of\r\nthe worst passages in our long ignominious toleration of the pirates of\r\nBarbary. On the 14th December Keppel was at the Canaries, and on the\r\n28th he reached Gorée a little island near the Cape de Verd. The French\r\npost soon surrendered under the combined pressure of bombardment by\r\nthe ships from the sea and attack by the troops under Colonel Worge on\r\nshore. Worge remained as governor of Senegal, and Keppel returned home.\r\n\r\nWhile Marsh and Keppel were expelling the French from the\r\nslave-producing region of West Africa, the navy had taken a foremost\r\nshare in delivering the first great blow at the French dominion\r\nin North America. Boscawen and Amherst had taken Louisbourg, and\r\nhad thereby cleared the way for the capture of Quebec by Wolfe and\r\nSaunders in the following year. The incapable Government of France was\r\nnow fairly launched into a war in Germany, and could spare neither\r\nattention nor adequate forces for the defence of its colonies.\r\n\r\nA squadron of six line-of-battle ships and five frigates left early\r\nin the year for Louisbourg and arrived in safety. Three of the liners\r\nwere armed _en flûte_, and were practically mere transports. Such a\r\nhandful of vessels as this was not even a match for the English ships\r\nwhich had wintered at Halifax. Our squadron in North American waters\r\nwas now under the orders of Sir Charles Hardy, who came out in the\r\n=Captain= in early spring. M. Drucourt, the naval officer who was\r\ngovernor of Louisbourg, foreseeing that he would be seriously attacked,\r\ncould only use the vessels in the port to strengthen his defences of\r\nthe place. Three frigates, the _Biche_, the _Echo_, and the _Fidèle_,\r\nwere sunk to block the entrance to the harbour. The measures taken to\r\nprevent the English from coming in had one good effect for the French.\r\nThey prevented the useless sacrifice of more of their ships than were\r\nalready in harbour. On the 29th May Captain Duchaffault de Besné, who\r\nhad left Rochefort on the 2nd with four liners, one armed _en flûte_\r\nand three frigates, appeared outside Louisbourg. Finding the entrance\r\nclosed he landed the soldiers he brought with him and went on to\r\nQuebec, where he remained a helpless spectator of the disaster.\r\n\r\nBoscawen meanwhile had left Spithead on the 18th February with a\r\npowerful fleet, escorting 13,000 troops under the command of Amherst,\r\nwho had Wolfe with him as one of his subordinates. The soldiers were\r\ndistributed in 150 transports. This great armament sailed first to\r\nHalifax, where Boscawen collected the whole naval force in those\r\nwaters, now amounting to twenty-three sail of the line and eighteen\r\nfrigates. When the necessary arrangements had been made at the base of\r\noperations soldiers and sailors started, “well combined in mutual love\r\nto each other and common resolution against the enemy,” on the 29th of\r\nMay, just when Duchaffault was landing the last French reinforcement.\r\nOn the 2nd June the fleet reached Gabarus Bay, on the south-eastern\r\ncoast of Cape Breton, below the place where a heap of ruins marks what\r\nwas once the site of Louisbourg. The combined operations lasted till\r\nthe 26th July, when Drucourt beat the _chamade_ after a stout fight.\r\nAs there was no enemy at sea the bulk of the work fell to the army,\r\nand was performed in a fashion presenting a welcome contrast to the\r\nfutility of Carthagena and Pondicherry. Amherst was a capable general,\r\nand Wolfe, besides being the most exact of officers in all matters of\r\ndetail, had the calm and rapid mind of the born leader in war, and\r\nthat zest for the joys of battle which makes the supreme fighter. To\r\nthe navy it fell to land the troops, to supply them, to assist in the\r\nbombardment by which some of the French ships in the harbour were\r\ndestroyed, and to do one dashing piece of work in its own line.\r\n\r\nThe steady bombardment from land and sea had greatly reduced the\r\nFrench squadron in the harbour, but two of their ships remained in a\r\ncondition to aid in the defence as late as the 24th of July. These were\r\nthe _Prudent_, 74, and the _Bienfaisant_, 64. Boscawen resolved to cut\r\nthem out, that is, to send in armed boats to board them and bring them\r\naway. At noon of the 24th a barge and a pinnace or cutter from every\r\nship, each commanded by a lieutenant and a mate or midshipman, met at\r\nthe flagship. The command of the whole was given to George Balfour of\r\nthe =Etna= fireship, and John Laforey of the =Hunter= sloop, the two\r\nsenior commanders of the fleet. The commander was, and is, the captain\r\nwho is not of full, or “post” rank. It might have given a thinking\r\nFrenchman some ground for reflection if he had known that of these\r\nofficers Balfour was a Scotchman, and therefore one of a people which\r\nhad once been the old ally of France, while Laforey’s name is only the\r\nanglicised form of La Foret, and he was of Huguenot descent, one of the\r\nthousands whose swords and skill were turned against their persecutors\r\nby the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The boats collected at\r\nevening round the flagship of Sir Charles Hardy, who commanded the\r\nadvance ships at the mouth of the harbour. At midnight they put off in\r\na thick fog with muffled oars and in strict silence. The steady fire\r\nfrom our batteries attracted the attention of the French, who were on\r\nthe ramparts in expectation of an immediate assault, and were keeping\r\nup a constant musketry fire. Laforey and Balfour led their boats past\r\nthe battery at the mouth of the harbour unseen and unheard. They had\r\ncarefully marked the place of the French ships during the day, and were\r\nable to take a sweep out into the harbour and advance through the night\r\nand the fog, till the hulks of the _Prudent_ and the _Bienfaisant_\r\nloomed up through the darkness. Then the uncontrollable love of the\r\nBritish seamen for shouting broke out into wild cheering, and all\r\nthe boats dashed alongside the liners. Laforey carried the _Prudent_\r\nand Balfour the _Bienfaisant_. One of them is said by tradition to\r\nhave made his way into the bows of the French ship by a place more\r\nconvenient than seemly. The actual taking of the vessels was not\r\ndifficult, as most of their crews were ashore aiding in the defence.\r\nBut the noise in the harbour drew the fire of the land batteries,\r\nand the duty of taking the prizes out was one of great hazard. The\r\n_Prudent_ was aground and could not be moved, so that Laforey had to\r\nset her on fire, but the _Bienfaisant_ was towed away in spite of the\r\nfire from the batteries. It was next day that M. Drucourt surrendered.\r\nThe total loss of the French Navy was four line-of-battle ships burnt\r\nand one taken, four vessels sunk to block the entry to the harbour\r\nand frigate taken. Only one vessel, the _Comète_ frigate, found an\r\nopportunity to slip through the blockade and escape to France.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Louisbourg, Sir Charles Hardy was despatched to the\r\nmouth of the St. Lawrence with a body of troops, commanded by Wolfe, to\r\ndestroy some French ports and intercept the squadron of Duchaffault,\r\nwho, it was calculated, would endeavour to get away before the\r\nwinter. The destruction was effected, but the ships escaped. Boscawen\r\nreturned home with the bulk of the fleet, leaving Rear-Admiral Durell\r\nto winter in Halifax, and resume the blockade of Quebec in spring. The\r\nvictorious British fleet and the French squadron were making their\r\nway home in the stormy autumn weather by the same route. On the 27th\r\nOctober, when Boscawen’s ships were much scattered by gales and he\r\nhad only four liners—one being the captured _Bienfaisant_—and some\r\nfrigates with him, he fell in with Duchaffault, seventy miles to the\r\nwest of Ushant. The French squadron consisted of four of the line and\r\none 56-gun ship belonging to the American company. It had just captured\r\nthe =Carnarvon=, East Indiaman. The stormy weather prevented a close\r\naction, which was fortunate for the Frenchman, for two of his liners\r\nwere only armed _en flûte_. Duchaffault’s vessels scattered after some\r\nconfused firing. He himself got to the Basque Roads, the =Carnarvon=\r\nwas retaken, and the other vessels, with one exception, reached home.\r\nThe unlucky ship which did not was the _Belliqueux_, 74, commanded by\r\nCaptain Martel, who seemingly became confused between the bad weather\r\nand the British fleet. He lost his course completely, came up on the\r\nwrong side of the Land’s End, and was embayed in the Bristol Channel.\r\nWhile at anchor under Lundy, he was sighted by the =Antelope=, 50,\r\nCaptain Thomas Saumarez. According to our account the _Belliqueux_\r\nsurrendered, and was a valuable prize, for she was found to be full of\r\nfine furs. The French will have it that she was unfairly taken, her\r\ncaptain having appealed to the humanity of our officer on the ground of\r\nthe distressed state of his ship, and having also cited cases in which\r\nEnglish vessels had been helped at French ports in war. The incredible\r\ntale is still told to illustrate the “disloyalty” of the English.\r\n\r\nIt goes much further to prove how much the French warships were used\r\nas transports and traders, partly by the Government, but also by their\r\nown officers, who made up for bad and irregular pay by what they called\r\n_la pacotille_, _i.e._ commercial ventures. If Captain Martel did, as\r\nhis countrymen say, propose to go into Bristol and throw himself on the\r\n“loyalty” of the English for relief, it is also highly probable that\r\nhe meant to get money for his furs from the Bristol merchants.\r\n\r\nWe have now come to the _annus mirabilis_ of the Seven Years’ War,\r\n1759. It was a year of extraordinary events and changes of fortune,\r\nand was also emphatically the year of the navy. From first to last the\r\nfleet was our main weapon, but both before and after 1759 it met with\r\nno worthy adversary at sea, and was mostly employed in co-operating\r\nwith troops. In this year it had to contend with other fleets, and the\r\ntale to be told is one of true naval warfare.\r\n\r\nThe experience of 1758 had not been wholly lost on the French\r\nGovernment, incapable as it was. It had been brought to see that its\r\nfleets must be better used if its colonial possessions were not to\r\nfall one by one before such expeditions as had taken Louisbourg. To\r\nmeet the English everywhere was plainly impossible, but there was one\r\ncourse which, if followed with success, would bring swift and decisive\r\nvictory. England itself might be invaded. A blow struck home to her\r\nheart would be mortal, and would at once undo all the effect of her\r\nsuccesses in distant seas. The ministers of King Louis XV. were the\r\nmore encouraged to try the venture because they were convinced that\r\nthe British fleet would be so weakened by distant enterprises as to\r\nbe unable to collect a superior force in the Channel. So a plan such\r\nas had been laid before by Louis XIV., and was to be laid again by\r\nNapoleon, was drafted. Troops were collected on the coast of Normandy,\r\nand at Vannes in the Morbihan, on the south side of Brittany. To clear\r\nthe way for them the fleet was to be used in a fashion which shows\r\nthat the boasted originality of Napoleon’s genius was in this, as in\r\nso many other fields, largely mere imitation of the methods of the old\r\nmonarchy. The first object was to draw off and distract the British\r\nfleet. A squadron was to be prepared at Dunkirk, and put under the\r\ncommand of Thurot, a very brave and honest privateer captain, who\r\nhad made for himself a reputation. It was to sail north and draw off\r\nour ships by menacing the coasts of Scotland and Ireland. The main\r\nFrench fleet had its headquarters at Brest, and was to be led by M.\r\nde Conflans, Vice-Admiral and Marshal of France. La Clue was to sail\r\nfrom Toulon, pass the Straits and join the fleet at Brest. The two\r\nwere then to cover the passage of the army under the Duc d’Aiguillon,\r\nwhich again was to come out from Vannes in transports, and from the\r\ncoast of Normandy in flat-bottomed vessels building at Havre. It will\r\nbe seen that this is essentially Napoleon’s plan in a simpler and less\r\nhazardous form, with the further merit that it was to be executed\r\nby the French fleet alone, and not with the co-operation of a most\r\ninefficient and reluctant ally. His scheme could not have come within\r\nmeasurable distance of success save by miracles of good fortune and\r\nthe help of incredible ineptitude on our side on which he had no right\r\nto calculate. Of this one it may be said that if the French fleet had\r\nbeen efficient, and the chiefs prompt and bold, it might at least have\r\ndriven us hard in the Channel. But it needed these conditions, and\r\nalso that the naval resources of England should have been less than\r\nthey were, and her admirals less vigilant and resolute. As every one\r\nof these conditions was wanting, the invasion scheme broke down in a\r\nlong succession of failures and disasters. Pitt met it by effectual\r\ncounter-measures in European waters, and did not for one instant\r\nslacken in his efforts to sweep the French from the continent of North\r\nAmerica, the West Indies, and the Eastern Seas. Every aggressive French\r\nnaval force in Europe was faced by an opposite more powerful than\r\nitself, and meanwhile Wolfe and Saunders sailed to Quebec, while Moore\r\nand Hodgson acted in the West Indies. In those waters the French Navy\r\ndid appear, represented by a squadron under M. de Bompart, who sailed\r\nearly and came back late, in time to be one of the causes which hurried\r\non the final disaster of the great invasion scheme.\r\n\r\nIn all this year the sun looked down, as the world rolled round on its\r\ndiurnal course, first on Pocock and D’Aché contending on the coast\r\nof Coromandel, then on the mobile, elastic, and impenetrable barrier\r\ndrawn by the fleets of Boscawen and Hawke round the coast of France,\r\nthen on the British squadron helping to break the French dominion in\r\nAmerica to pieces. All else went on behind the home fleets, and was\r\ndependent on them, and as no narrative can be simultaneous, but must\r\nneeds be consecutive, the first place is to be given to the operations\r\nof the war in Europe. At the most northerly point of the line we had\r\nto defend, Commodore Boys was stationed to watch Thurot’s squadron in\r\nDunkirk. Admiral Smith was stationed with Piercy Brett in the Downs,\r\nand between them and Boys, Rodney watched the flotilla preparing at\r\nHavre de Grâce. Hawke, with the grand fleet, took in hand the blockade\r\nof Brest, while the duty of preventing the junction of La Clue with\r\nConflans, by blockading Toulon, or by holding the Straits of Gibraltar,\r\nwas entrusted to Boscawen. A glance at the map will show that the\r\nadvantage of position lay with us. The hazards and uncertainties of war\r\nat sea are always many—and they were more numerous in the times when\r\nthe ships depended on sails and the wind. Yet the balance of chances\r\nwas on our side, since it was more probable on the whole that Hawke\r\nand Boscawen could combine, if either failed to stop his immediate\r\nadversary, than that Conflans or La Clue could. On the supposition,\r\nhowever, that Boscawen was eluded and left behind, so that Hawke was in\r\nperil of having both French fleets on him at once, he could still fall\r\nback on, or be joined by, the ships in the Downs. Then he would be able\r\nto give battle, while Boscawen could follow, and either make our force\r\noverwhelming, or bring up a fresh squadron on the French when newly\r\ndamaged by battle. Our squadrons had in fact the advantage of having\r\nshorter distances to go than the French in order to join forces, and\r\neven if driven back they would be driven back on the support of friends.\r\n\r\nIn order of time the first effectual blow struck by our navy at the\r\nFrench as they endeavoured to unite for the invasion of England was\r\nthe bombardment of Havre, on the 2nd July, by Rodney. Flat-bottomed\r\nboats were being constructed there, and we poured bombs on them, with\r\ngood effect, for a whole day. In order to direct the service the\r\nbetter, Rodney transferred his flag from the =Achilles=, 60, which\r\ndrew too many feet of water to come close in on that shallow coast, to\r\nthe =Venus= frigate, commanded by Captain Samuel Hood. This service\r\nbrought together two men of strong and widely different character,\r\nwho will be found acting together at a great crisis twenty-two years\r\nlater—not, however, for the first time, for Hood had been a subordinate\r\nwith Rodney in the =Ludlow Castle= long before. The bombardment was\r\neffective, and so was a stroke struck at some of the French boats\r\nas they endeavoured to slip down the coast later on. Meanwhile Boys\r\nwatched Thurot at Dunkirk so closely that the Frenchman had no chance\r\nto escape till the very end of the year. The first ruinous blow at the\r\ncomplicated French scheme was given far to the South.\r\n\r\nBoscawen sailed from Spithead on the 14th April with eight sail of the\r\nline and frigates to take over the command on the Mediterranean. He\r\njoined Brodrick, who was already blockading Toulon, off Cape Sicié, on\r\n16th May. The fleet now consisted of fifteen ships of the line, with\r\ntwelve frigates and sloops and two fireships. La Clue, who had been\r\nunable to drive off Brodrick’s smaller force, could do nothing against\r\nBoscawen. His squadron was not yet ready for any service. The blockade\r\nlasted till the 8th July, when want of water and the necessity for\r\ncleaning his ships compelled Boscawen to return to Gibraltar. While\r\nbefore Toulon he had made an unsuccessful attempt to destroy two French\r\nfrigates under protection of the coast batteries. He reached Gibraltar\r\non the 4th August, after taking in fresh water on the neutral coast of\r\nSpain, and began to clean and refit. Frigates were stationed on the\r\nSpanish shore and the coast of Barbary to give notice of any attempt of\r\nthe French to pass the Straits.\r\n\r\nThe retreat of our squadron opened the way to the French, and if La\r\nClue had thought himself able to act at once, he might have passed\r\nthe Straits while Boscawen’s ships were taking in their water on the\r\ncoast of Spain. But the sense of inferiority, material and moral, which\r\nplainly weighed on the minds of all French naval officers in this\r\nyear, made him hesitate. Having that to do which could only be done\r\nby extreme promptitude, he did not leave Toulon till the early days\r\nof August, when the British admiral was already at Gibraltar, and in\r\na position to intercept him in the Straits. During the night of the\r\n16th-17th of August the French fleet approached the passage leading to\r\nthe Ocean. It was sighted by Captain M‘Cleverty, of the =Gibraltar=\r\nfrigate, who was cruising between Estépona and Ceuta Point, and who\r\nreported at once to the admiral. Boscawen’s fleet was still at work\r\nrefitting, and in the flagship, the =Namur=, the sails were unbent—that\r\nis, not fixed to the yards. But such good speed was made that by ten\r\no’clock at night the ships were all out. They went as they were ready\r\nand as place served, with no pedantic attention to the fopperies of\r\norder. Boscawen had with him the =Warspite=, =Culloden=, =Swiftsure=,\r\n=Intrepid=, =America=, =Portland=, and =Guernsey=. Admiral Brodrick\r\ncould not clear the bay till later than his commander-in-chief, and\r\nfollowed him with the other ships. There was an interval of some miles\r\nbetween them, but the wind was easterly, and Brodrick was certain of\r\nbeing able to join his chief if the leading ships were able to overtake\r\nthe enemy. Both pressed eagerly along the route they calculated that\r\nthe enemy must have followed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French admiral, who had with him twelve sail of the line\r\nand three frigates, had headed his pursuers, and as the British ships\r\nwere leaving Gibraltar Bay had got as far as Cape Spartel, and had\r\ncleared the current which runs from the ocean into the Mediterranean.\r\nAt ten at night he had his ships about him, though not in good order;\r\nfor some of them were bad sailers, and were lagging behind his flagship\r\n_L’Océan_. Yet he believed that he could communicate his orders, or at\r\nleast show the course he meant to follow. So he headed W.N.W., and then\r\nput out the guiding light of the flagship in order to conceal his route\r\nfrom the English frigates. The calculation that his own captains would\r\nsee and understand, in the darkness and the excitement, was rash—and\r\nall the more because when he left Toulon it was understood that if the\r\nStraits were passed the fleet was to head for Cadiz, anchor there, and\r\nmake another start. It was a foolish plan, because it invited another\r\nblockade. La Clue, therefore, was absolutely right in making for the\r\nopen sea. But now was seen the influence of that miserable theory, that\r\nwar can be waged effectually by hasty runs from one cover to another\r\nand by evasion. Five of the French line and all the frigates were at\r\nsome distance from the flagship. When La Clue and the six vessels so\r\nclose to him, that they had no shadow of excuse for not seeing what he\r\nwas doing, steered to the W.N.W., the laggards acted on the supposition\r\nthat the obvious course was to run for cover, and headed nearly due\r\nnorth for Cadiz. Thus all through the night the two sailed on diverging\r\nlines, and when day broke the French admiral found himself with seven\r\nsail only of his fifteen about him, and saw that five of his line and\r\nall his frigates had vanished in what direction he knew not, though he\r\nmight well have guessed, under the horizon.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the best course he could have followed might well have\r\nbeen to steer for Cadiz, whither it was probable that his lost vessels\r\nhad gone, and where they were indeed waiting for him. The next best\r\ncourse might have been to keep on straight for Brest. But he remained\r\nwhere he was, looking about for the liners which had parted company.\r\nSome sail were seen on the horizon, and La Clue headed towards them\r\nin the hope that they were his friends. They turned out to be Swedish\r\nmerchant-ships. Then other sails were seen behind, and for them also\r\nthe Frenchman steered only to discover that they belonged to the fleet\r\nof Boscawen. Nothing now remained to be done but to flee for refuge,\r\nand in the circumstances the only cover La Clue had any chance of\r\nreaching was the neutral coast of Portugal, to the North.\r\n\r\nWhen the French were seen on the forenoon of the 18th August, the\r\nBritish fleet was still in two divisions: Boscawen was leading with\r\none, and Brodrick was some distance astern. The easterly breeze was\r\nstronger near the land than out at sea, and when the presence of the\r\nenemy was signalled, Brodrick crowded on sail, and rapidly reduced the\r\nspace between himself and his admiral. It is a proof of the superiority\r\nof our officers and men in seamanship, the art by which the utmost is\r\nmade of a ship, that although the French vessels were as a rule better\r\nbuilt for speed than ours, and although those with La Clue were swift\r\nand their crews had every motive to make haste, yet the van of the\r\nBritish fleet forced on action early in the afternoon. The French would\r\nonly make a running fight, as their pursuers overtook them, one by\r\none, and ranged themselves on either side. Captain de Sabran-Grammont,\r\nof the _Centaure_, 74, the last ship in the French squadron, and the\r\nfirst to be overtaken, showed the virtue which redeemed the follies\r\nand vices of the nobles of his country, a flawless personal valour.\r\nHe made a gallant effort to cover the flight of his brother-captains.\r\nThough Boscawen and two others attacked him at once, he made so fierce\r\na resistance that the _Centaure_ did not surrender till long after\r\ndark, when the captain was dead, 200 of her men had fallen, and she was\r\nso shattered that the prize crews had the utmost difficulty in keeping\r\nher afloat. Boscawen’s flagship the =Namur= lost her mizen-mast, and\r\nthe admiral had to transfer his flag to the =Newark=. But for errors of\r\nmanagement on the part of individual captains, the whole of the French\r\nsquadron must have been taken. Some of our captains were awkward in\r\nhandling their ships, and allowed other vessels of ours to get between\r\nthem and the enemy. Others who came up on the lee side of the French\r\ndid so at such a distance that they were never able to force a close\r\naction. These mistakes provoked Boscawen into declaring when all was\r\nover, that “It was well, but that it might have been a great deal\r\nbetter.” No French vessel was taken on the 18th except the _Centaure_.\r\nDuring the night two, the _Guerrier_ and the _Souverain_, turned to\r\nthe west, and escaped in the dark. Both reached Rochefort. The four\r\nremaining with the admiral took refuge in the waters of Portugal at\r\nLagos. The flagship _L’Océan_ and the _Redoutable_ ran ashore, the\r\n_Téméraire_ and the _Modeste_ anchored some distance out, in reliance\r\non Portuguese neutrality. But Boscawen would not allow that to be any\r\nprotection. Both were taken, and the two which had been beached were\r\nburnt. La Clue, who had lost a leg by a cannon-shot in the action of\r\nthe day before, died at Lagos. For the breach of Portuguese neutrality\r\nwe afterwards apologised, but no rebuke was given to Boscawen.\r\n\r\nThe Toulon fleet’s share in the great invasion scheme had completely\r\nfailed. Boscawen returned home with part of his fleet and a large\r\nconvoy of merchant-ships. Admiral Brodrick remained to blockade the\r\nFrench, who had taken refuge in Cadiz. A storm drove him off in January\r\n1760, and they were able to escape to Toulon.\r\n\r\nThough a combined operation was no longer possible, after the disaster\r\nof the 18th and 19th August, the French still clung to the hope that\r\nan invasion might be carried out from Brest, where M. de Conflans lay\r\nwith the main fleet. All through the fine-weather months he was keenly\r\nwatched by Hawke. The French force was of twenty-one sail of the line,\r\nthe English of twenty-five, and the difference was enough to convince\r\nthe ministers of Louis XV. that it was useless to expect a victory\r\nfrom the use of open force. Yet they would not renounce the hope of\r\ncarrying out an invasion by means of a fleet confessedly unequal to the\r\nhazard of giving battle on the way to our shores. The situation must\r\nhave arisen in any case, for even if La Clue had escaped Boscawen’s\r\npursuit, it was to be supposed that the English admiral would follow\r\nhim, and thereby bring his own ships to reinforce Hawke. The two would\r\nhave formed a very superior force to the combined fleets of Conflans\r\nand La Clue, even if the second, after evading Boscawen, had also\r\navoided running into Sir Edward’s much stronger fleet outside of Brest.\r\nIf he had steered for Rochefort, the French admirals would still have\r\nbeen divided. When this combination was ruined by the defeat of La\r\nClue, by the capture and destruction of five of his best ships and\r\nthe imprisonment of most of the others at Cadiz, all hope of invading\r\nEngland ought to have been resigned. But the French king and his\r\nministers could not reconcile themselves to failure. So they hit upon\r\na scheme of folly such as would be incredible in other than men too\r\nignorant to understand the task they had undertaken, too vain to allow\r\nthemselves to be taught, and so reckless in their selfish frivolity\r\nthat rather than allow themselves to be blamed for doing nothing they\r\nwould do what in all probability would bring ruin to the officers and\r\nmen at their orders.\r\n\r\nIn substance it was that M. de Conflans was to wait till bad weather\r\ndrove Sir Edward Hawke away from Brest. Then he was to slip out, pick\r\nup the transports and troops collected for the invasion at Vannes,\r\nand convoy them to some point on the coast of Great Britain. The\r\ncalculation was that even if Conflans was intercepted by Hawke, he\r\nwould be able to cover the transports, which could go on to their\r\ndestination, or at the worst could come back safe. Yet the French\r\nministers had the means of knowing that there was a British squadron\r\nin reserve behind Hawke in the Downs, and that the events at Lagos had\r\nset free Boscawen. We still hear of invasion schemes no wiser than\r\nthis, and it is no waste of space or time to insist on the folly of\r\nthis historical plan. Conflans, who was visibly unequal to the duty of\r\ngiving Hawke battle, was to go to sea hampered by a convoy and there\r\nrun the hazard of being brought to action. The convoy, notoriously\r\nincapable of defending itself, was to be supposed to go on even when\r\nits protecting ships were assailed, though there were other British\r\nships than Hawke’s, and he could have spared part of his fleet for the\r\npurpose of pursuing the transports, and yet have left himself equal to\r\nConflans. If Napoleon had not laid plans equally fantastic, if projects\r\nfor the invasion of England every whit as absurd were not elaborated by\r\nsoldiers of the kind called “scientific” to-day, we should be tempted\r\nto think that the plan of campaign drafted at Paris in 1759 could only\r\nhave been the work of the feather-headed harlot who managed the languid\r\ndebauchee on the French throne, and of the men who got office by her\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nWith most naval battles we can afford to treat the sea as an open plain\r\nneeding no description. But this is not the case with the battle of\r\nQuiberon. The lie of the land is as necessary to be kept in mind as the\r\nshape of the country is for the proper understanding of Oudenarde or\r\nSalamanca. It has been said above that while Conflans lay blockaded at\r\nBrest, the troops for the invasion of England were collected at Vannes,\r\nin the Morbihan, on the south side of the Breton Peninsula. From the\r\nPointe de Penmarch, the south-westerly headland of Finisterre, the\r\ncoast runs to the east, but with a slope to the south, till it reaches\r\nthe entry of the river Vilaine. Here it turns wholly to the south, and\r\nstretches down to the Pyrenees and the coast of Biscay. It is mostly\r\nfoul on the southern side of Brittany, and fringed with islands. At\r\ntwo-thirds or so of the distance from the Pointe de Penmarch to the\r\nmouth of the Vilaine, the peninsula of Quiberon juts out to the south,\r\nin shape something like a lobster’s claw with its hook turned to the\r\neast. On the eastern side is the bay of Quiberon. The anchorage is fine\r\nwhere the bottom of sand mud and shells is free from rocks, but in\r\nmany places it is foul, and of its total breadth of nine miles, only\r\nfive or six are really safe for large vessels. Following the line of\r\nthe mainland on the north side, we reach the entry to the tangle of\r\nislands, deep passages, shallows, and lagoons named the Morbihan, to\r\nthe north of which is the town of Vannes. In this refuge the transports\r\nhad been collected to wait till the fleet came round from Brest and\r\nsecured them a safe passage to the sea. The Morbihan is closed on the\r\nsouth side by the peninsula of Rhuis. The coast goes eastward from\r\nRhuis to the Vilaine, and then runs south in a rolling line to the\r\nPointe de Croisic, at the northern side of the Loire, beyond which it\r\nneed not now be followed. The peninsula of Quiberon, the entry to the\r\nVilaine, and the Pointe de Croisic form roughly a right angle. Now draw\r\na line from Croisic to the Pointe de Conguel on the north-west, which\r\nis the southern extremity of the peninsula of Quiberon. All along that\r\nline, with openings of clear water here and there, are piled the perils\r\nof the Breton coast, innumerable and thrown together in inextricable\r\nconfusion. In front of Croisic and at low tide a number of black rocks\r\nat distances of from three and a half to five and a half miles show\r\nthe position of the mass of sunken reef called the Plateau du Four. To\r\nthe west of the Four there is an open passage closed on the outer side\r\nby the rocks called the Grands Cardinaux. From them stretches to the\r\nnorth-west an unbroken column of islands and rocks, separated from the\r\nPointe de Conguel by the passage known as La Teignouse. The approach\r\nto this is made perilous on the west by the Plateau de Mirvideaux. To\r\nthe south and west of the small islands between Les Grands Cardinaux\r\nand La Teignouse lies the Fair Island, Belleisle. The entry to Quiberon\r\nby La Teignouse being hazardous, the bay is approached from the\r\nsouth-east—that is to say, between Les Grands Cardinaux and Pointe de\r\nSaint Jacques on the peninsula of Rhuis, which is due north of them.\r\nThis opening is ten miles across. When a fleet was coming in from the\r\nopen sea, it would pass to the south of Belleisle and of Les Grands\r\nCardinaux. Then it would turn first to the north, and afterwards bend\r\nto the north-west, till it reached the clean anchorage inside the\r\npeninsula of Quiberon. The triangle of perils and barriers here roughly\r\ndescribed was the scene of the most heroic achievement in the long\r\nhistory of the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\nHawke established the blockade of Brest early in June. No serious\r\nattempt to drive him off was made by the French. On the 2nd July\r\nConflans tried to do by trick what he dared not venture to do by force.\r\nThe bulk of Hawke’s fleet lay some distance off at sea, while an\r\ninshore, or advanced, squadron under Captain Hervey watched the French\r\nfleet at anchor in Camaret Bay, just outside the entrance to Brest.\r\nThis was the Augustus John Hervey, afterwards third Earl of Bristol,\r\nwho was the son of the Lord Hervey so savagely attacked by Pope, and\r\nof the beautiful Molly Lepel. He maintained the well-established\r\nreputation of his family for immoral ability. His marriage to, and\r\ncollusive divorce from, the notorious Elizabeth Chudleigh, bigamous\r\nDuchess of Kingston, are conspicuous events in the scandalous chronicle\r\nof the time. But though his private life was always disorderly and\r\noccasionally ignominious, he was a very brave and skilful naval\r\nofficer. All through the summer of 1759 he and Captain Keppel were\r\nthe eyes and hands of the fleet. When on the 2nd July four French\r\nline-of-battle ships stood out of Camaret Bay to drive him off, Hervey\r\ndid not hesitate to engage for a moment, though he had with him only\r\ntwo of the line and some frigates. He well knew that the sound of\r\nhis guns would soon bring up Hawke’s fleet, and it did. The French\r\ndrew back immediately under the protection of their batteries. Their\r\nintention had been, after driving off Hervey, to go round to Quiberon,\r\nchase away the small squadron under Captain Reynolds, of the Firm, and\r\nliberate the transports at Vannes—a proposal worthy of the intelligence\r\nthey showed all through the year. The sub-blockade of Quiberon remained\r\nunbroken. When the =Firm= became foul, Reynolds was relieved by Captain\r\nDuff, of the =Rochester=, 50, who remained in possession of the waters\r\nof the French bay with four 50-gun ships and some frigates till he was\r\nswept into the great hurricane of wind and battle of the 20th November.\r\n\r\nThe fine weather and the energy shown by Pitt in supporting the\r\nfleets at sea made it possible to keep the crews well supplied with\r\nprovisions. They enjoyed a good health of which there were few examples\r\nin the previous history of the navy. Yet the blockade was tedious work,\r\nrelieved only by such events as this action of the 2nd July, by the\r\ncutting out of the _Modeste_ from under the French batteries, a gallant\r\nfeat of Hervey’s, or by the unsuccessful attempt of Captain Barrington\r\nof the =Achilles= to destroy some French ships in the Morbihan.\r\nMeanwhile there was growing impatience at Paris with the timidity\r\nof Conflans, who showed extreme reluctance to go to sea without an\r\nexpress order. Conflans had served with some credit, but he owed his\r\ncommand to court favour, and had no reputation as a manœuvrer in the\r\nFrench Navy, while all his words and actions show him to have been\r\nlight and ostentatious, with no firmness of character. The instructions\r\nhe issued to his captains when he did go out are full of a pretence of\r\nconfidence which was ridiculous after the timidity of the summer, and\r\nmore ridiculous when read by the light of the final disaster. He wrote\r\nas if he feared that Hawke would not give him a good chance to fight.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th November a gale, and the needs of the blockading fleet,\r\ndid for the French what they could not do for themselves. Hawke was\r\ncompelled to bear up for Torbay. Frigates were left to watch Brest. The\r\nwesterly gale which had forced Hawke to draw off from the dangerous lee\r\nshore of Brest, brought home the French squadron of M. de Bompart, now\r\ncoming back from the West Indies. To his surprise and relief, he found\r\nthe way to port open. His safe arrival convinced Conflans that Hawke\r\nmust be gone. Taking the crews out of Bompart’s ships to reinforce his\r\nown, the marshal put to sea on the 14th November, when the wind had\r\nmoderated, and the last great effort of the French to carry out the\r\ninvasion began.\r\n\r\nOn the same date Hawke left Torbay to resume the blockade of Brest.\r\nOn the 16th he was met by the news that the French had been seen\r\ntwenty-four leagues to the north-west of Belleisle, steering to the\r\nsouth-east. There could be no doubt in Hawke’s mind that they were\r\nbound for Quiberon, and he instantly headed in pursuit. The news that\r\nthe French were at sea spread rapidly over England, and produced an\r\noutburst of popular anger against Hawke, which gives the exact value\r\nof the most sweet voices of the mob. It ought to have rejoiced to hear\r\nthat the enemy was out, and had only to look at the measures taken by\r\nGovernment to see that there was no peril. The troops and militia were\r\nput to some disturbance, which was unnecessary, save for the purpose of\r\nquieting the national nerves. A more rational measure was the formation\r\nof a reserve squadron of six ships of the line under Rear-Admiral Geary\r\nto reinforce Hawke. In these days, too, Vice-Admiral Saunders reached\r\nthe mouth of the Channel on his way back from the conquest of Quebec.\r\nHe had but three liners with him, and they were much tried by service,\r\nyet without a moment’s hesitation he sailed to join the Channel Fleet.\r\nIt is true that he did not arrive in time to be of service, but it was\r\nfine conduct, and an instance of the noble spirit now animating the\r\nnavy which of itself was enough to calm all fears.\r\n\r\nWhile the hubbub was raging at home, Hawke was straining to overtake\r\nConflans. The wind between the 14th and the evening of the 19th\r\nNovember either fell calm or blew from the east, hampering both fleets.\r\nOn the evening of the 19th it began to blow strong from the west, and\r\nthere was every sign of a coming gale. Conflans was to the south-west\r\nof Belleisle, and Hawke behind him. Fearing that the force of the wind\r\nwould cause him to make the land during the night, the French admiral\r\ncarried little sail. Hawke, who was farther out, had less motive for\r\ncaution, and was able to carry more sail than his opponent, thereby\r\nreducing the distance between them. When the late November daybreak\r\ncame, this was the position; out at sea was Hawke with twenty-three\r\nsail of the line. Ahead of him, and just so far ahead of him as to\r\nbe under the horizon line, was Conflans with twenty-one sail and\r\nfive frigates or sloops. Both were flying before a rising gale from\r\nthe W.N.W. and heading to enter Quiberon Bay by the passage between\r\nthe Grands Cardinaux and the Plateau du Four. Ahead of Conflans was\r\nthe =Vengeance= frigate of 28 guns, whose captain, Nightingale, was\r\ncarrying all the sail he could bear, and was firing signal guns rapidly\r\nto warn Commodore Duff at anchor in Quiberon Bay that the French fleet\r\nwas at hand. Duff at once ordered the cables to be cut and all speed\r\nto be made to sea, for there was not a moment to be lost if his little\r\nsquadron was to escape from between the land and an overwhelming\r\nenemy. The surest road to safety was round the Pointe de Conguel, and\r\nthrough La Teignouse to the north of Belleisle. But to beat through\r\nthat channel, all scarred as it is with rocks, in the face of a gale\r\nblowing right down from the W.N.W., was a feat which only one of his\r\nships could achieve. The others were compelled to take the frightfully\r\nperilous course of running down the east side of Belleisle and rounding\r\nit to the south. Every yard of the road brought them nearer to the\r\nFrench fleet, which was coming up from the west and south. It was a\r\nquestion of minutes whether Conflans’ ships would or would not cut the\r\npath of escape. Never since the fleet of Bazan was seen stretching\r\nacross the roadstead of Flores in the Azores had an English squadron\r\nbeen in greater peril than Duff’s, and the men knew it well. Therefore\r\nit was that when the lookout-man at the masthead of the =Rochester=\r\nhailed to report that he saw Hawke’s sails to windward of the enemy, a\r\nwild shout of joy went up, and the men threw their hats into the sea at\r\nthe French, in a horseplay of defiance. It was the gesture of the boxer\r\nor single-stick player at a country fair who gave a challenge. It was\r\nnow about eight o’clock in the morning. The reader will bear in mind\r\nthat Duff’s ships were just about to be pinned to the south coast of\r\nBelleisle, that the French ships were closing in on them from the sea,\r\nand that the topsails of Hawke were rising over the horizon against\r\nthe grey November sky. The clouds were driving furiously overhead. The\r\nNorsemen, whose descendants were numerous in the English fleet, and not\r\nabsent from the French, would have seen the Valkyries riding, and would\r\nhave heard the voices of the “choosers of the slain.” Here is the list\r\nof the ships and the captains:—\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLEET OF HAWKE\r\n\r\n =The Royal George=   100   { Sir E.

But it was not\r\nuntil a quarter to ten that Howe in the =Magnanime=, who had been sent\r\non to make the land and guide the fleet, was able to signal that the\r\nFrench fleet was ahead, and to report its force. Meanwhile the French\r\nadmiral, who was at first incredulous of the approach of his opponent,\r\nhad been convinced at last that the British fleet was indeed upon him,\r\nand had begun to collect his ships, which had been scattered in pursuit\r\nof Duff. He endeavoured to form a line, and appeared resolved to give\r\nbattle. When Howe’s signal was seen, Hawke gave the order to form the\r\nline abreast, and for the heavy sailers which were lagging behind\r\nto set more sail and come up to his flag. As the British ships rose\r\nabove the horizon both fleets were much scattered, and the admirals\r\nwere endeavouring to bring them together. It was not a rapid process\r\nwith sailing-ships, which could not spread much canvas in stormy\r\nweather. The whole forenoon slipped away before a shot could be fired,\r\nand all the vessels were still to the west and south of Belleisle at\r\nmidday. Duff joined Hawke at eleven o’clock. The French admiral was\r\nnow able to measure the strength of the force about to fall on him. He\r\nestimated it at thirty sail of the line, which even when the 50-gun\r\nships of Commodore Duff were counted in was an exaggeration, only to be\r\naccounted for by fear, or by a dishonest wish to excuse the weakness of\r\nhis conduct to his superiors. Losing all confidence, Conflans decided\r\nnot to give battle, but to make for Quiberon Bay. He therefore hoisted\r\nthe signal for retreat, and set the example by leading the way in the\r\n_Soleil Royal_. He did not believe that Hawke would follow him into\r\nthe narrow and broken waters of the bay, but he calculated that if the\r\nEnglish admiral did take this bold course, he himself could work up\r\ntowards the peninsula of Quiberon, and so gain the weather-gage and\r\nthe advantage of position over an opponent embayed on a hostile and\r\nunfamiliar coast. This is what he said in his exculpatory dispatch,\r\nbut it has much the look of an afterthought, and the probability is\r\nthat Conflans really hoped to reach the enclosed waters of the Morbihan\r\nbefore being overtaken.\r\n\r\nHad he been opposed to a commonplace officer, he would probably have\r\nsucceeded. Hawke was too bold a man to turn his mind to considerations\r\nof superfluous prudence in the presence of an enemy who was manifestly\r\nseeking to avoid battle. The signal for the line abreast was hauled\r\ndown and replaced by another, for the vessels nearest the French to\r\npursue, to overtake, and to bring the enemy to action, and for all\r\nothers to come on at their best speed, pressing into battle where\r\nand how they could. The two fleets swept on past Belleisle, rolling\r\nand pitching in the rising sea. It was shortly after two in the\r\nafternoon that the French admiral led his flying force round the Grands\r\nCardinaux, and already the battle had begun with the ships behind him.\r\nThe =Warspight=, Sir John Bentley, and the =Dorsetshire=, Captain P.\r\nDenis, were the first of the English ships to come up with and open\r\nfire on the enemy. They were soon joined by the =Revenge=, =Magnanime=,\r\n=Torbay=, =Montagu=, =Resolution=, =Swiftsure=, and =Defiance=. Thus,\r\nwhen the French ships ran between the Grands Cardinaux and Plateau du\r\nFour, all those at the end of their line were already mingled with\r\ntheir pursuers, and both the fleets came in together locked in a savage\r\nembrace of battle.\r\n\r\nNever in the long history of war was the truth that the timid is also\r\nthe dangerous course more convincingly shown than in this battle. As\r\nthe English ships overtook the French, ranging up on both sides, they\r\ndid not linger by the first they met, but pushed on ahead, leaving\r\nthe work of destruction to be completed by their comrades coming\r\non behind. Thus the French rear ships were successively assailed by\r\nsuperior numbers firing into them from right and left. It must also\r\nbe remembered that when the ships turned round Les Grands Cardinaux\r\nand headed to the north and north-west, they turned their left sides\r\nto the wind and were pressed over to the right. The slope, or list,\r\ngiven to them was so great that it was impossible to open the ports of\r\nthe lowest tier of guns on the lee side. When any English captain came\r\nup on the lee side of a Frenchman, he himself had the full use of his\r\nweather battery, while his opponent could not fire his heaviest and\r\nmost effective tier of guns. Conflans, in fact, had so managed matters\r\nthat he gave Hawke’s superiority of numbers an effect it could not\r\nhave had if the French fleet had accepted battle outside Belleisle, in\r\ngood order, and in a united body. The rear of his line was miserably\r\ncrushed. The _Formidable_, 80, the flagship of the Chef d’Escadre\r\nSaint-André Duverger, was shattered to pieces by our fire. Duverger\r\nhimself and 200 of his men were slain, and his ship surrendered. The\r\n_Thésée_, 74, filled and went down with all hands, unquestionably\r\nbecause her captain, M. de Kersaint, opened his lower deck ports to\r\nfire and allowed the water to rush in. Keppel on the =Torbay= all but\r\nincurred the same fate by running the same hazard, but his ship freed\r\nherself of the water in time.\r\n\r\nA detailed description of the battle is an impossibility. The wind\r\nshifted suddenly from W.N.W. to N.N.W., and increased in violence as\r\nit travelled round, adding to the already frightful confusion of the\r\nforty and odd great ships manœuvring in the confined triangle of water\r\nbounded by the coast and the islands. The sea was heaving underfoot,\r\ndriven in great waves before the wind, and dragged seaward by the\r\nebb. The storm howled through the rigging. The ships under reduced\r\ncanvas made short tacks to avoid the rocks all around. Conflans, after\r\nstretching up to Quiberon Bay, turned back to the help of the ships\r\nbehind him, and the two fleets were mingled in a wild whirl of storm\r\nand battle. Collisions were incessant between enemies and friends, but\r\nthe English, as being the more practised seamen, avoided them better,\r\nand suffered from them less. To the French admiral it suggested itself\r\nas a possibility that he might fight his way out again, and get once\r\nmore to windward of Belleisle. Signals followed one another rapidly\r\nfrom the _Soleil Royal_, but they were not, and they could not be\r\nobeyed. The rolling of the ships rendered their fire ineffective, and\r\nthe danger of wreck compelled the captains to think constantly of the\r\nsafety of their vessels. Sunset, too, came early, and the dark put a\r\nstop to all manœuvring. Thus there was neither time nor opportunity to\r\ntake many prizes. One other French ship, the _Superbe_, shared the fate\r\nof the _Thésée_, and the _Héros_, dismasted and riddled by the English\r\nfire, hauled down her flag and dropped anchor. But the enemy was none\r\nthe less completely beaten. Seven of his ships found refuge in the\r\nVilaine by grovelling over the mud bar of the river. Others fled down\r\nthe coast to the south, where one of them, the _Juste_, was stranded\r\nnear St. Nazaire. Her first and second captains, the brothers Allouar,\r\nhad both fallen. Conflans himself ran inside the Point du Four, and\r\nanchored off Croisic. When darkness came down, Hawke made the signal to\r\nanchor. It was, according to the code of the time, two guns fired to\r\nleeward, and was naturally not distinguished while cannon were being\r\nfired on all sides. Several of the English ships kept under way all\r\nnight, but most anchored between the Grands Cardinaux and the little\r\nisland of Dumet, which lies to north-east towards the mouth of the\r\nVilaine. Two English ships, the =Essex= and the =Resolution=, were lost\r\non the Four in the dark. The captain of the _Héros_ finding that he was\r\nnot boarded by an English prize crew, took advantage of the darkness to\r\ncut his cables and allow his vessel to drive ashore near Croisic, when\r\nConflans had anchored in the _Soleil Royal_. In the morning the admiral\r\nfound himself alone, with the bulk of Hawke’s fleet at anchor a few\r\nmiles off. Hopeless of escape, he ran his flagship ashore to prevent\r\nher from falling into our hands.\r\n\r\nJudged by the fighting alone, the battle of Quiberon was less arduous\r\nthan many we have fought with the French and all we have fought with\r\nthe Dutch. But the fighting was in this case the least of the battle.\r\nIt stands in the first rank, if not at the head of all the heroisms\r\nof the fleet, because it was won over the storm, the sea, and the\r\nrocks, as well as over man. The boldness of Hawke in flying at his\r\nenemy before his own force was thoroughly united, and the magnificent\r\nseamanship of his captains in circumstances of unparalleled difficulty\r\nset this battle apart. Although the French had but one vessel taken and\r\nfive destroyed, they were utterly routed. The seven ships which fled\r\ninto the Vilaine were lost for all practical purposes, and the spirit\r\nof their navy was broken for the rest of the war. There is a legend\r\nwhich tells how the sailing master of the =Royal George= expostulated\r\nwhen ordered to take the ship among the rocks of Quiberon, and how\r\nHawke answered that his subordinate had done his duty by pointing out\r\nthe danger and was now to obey the order. If this story has not an\r\nactual, it has a mythical, truth. What gives its peculiar character to\r\nHawke’s victory at Quiberon was its magnificent military quality. To\r\nthe mere seaman there was something like madness in rushing just before\r\ndark into the most frightful of the possible perils of navigation.\r\nBut the admiral, though a finished seaman, was also a great fighting\r\nleader, and to him the occasion seemed one on which to use his skill,\r\nnot to avoid but to incur dangers, for a great purpose. Nothing equal\r\nin conduct will be met for twenty-two years, and until we come to\r\nHood’s fine, though unsuccessful effort to save the island of St. Kitts\r\nfrom the Comte de Grasse. Indeed the whole passage of the blockade of\r\nBrest and the battle of Quiberon was without precedent in the history\r\nof the navy, and without an equal successor for forty years. The\r\ntenacity with which the fleet kept its watch into the stormy winter\r\nmonths would have appeared the excess of temerity to the naval officers\r\nof former times, who thought it dangerous to leave the great ships at\r\nsea after September. What also was without precedent was the success\r\nwith which the crews were kept in health by the determination of the\r\nadmiral that they should be regularly supplied with fresh meat and\r\nwholesome beer. After Quiberon the stormy weather made the service of\r\nthe victuallers difficult, and there was a change for the worse which\r\nis recorded in the navy’s one contribution to epigrammatic literature—\r\n\r\n    “Ere Hawke did bang\r\n    Monsieur Conflans\r\n      You sent us beef and beer;\r\n    Now Monsieur’s beat\r\n    We’ve nought to eat\r\n      Since you have nought to fear.”\r\n\r\nIt adds a grace to the heroic figure of Hawke that he was tender of the\r\nlives and of the health of his men. But his good sense taught him that\r\nsickly crews must needs make a crippled fleet.\r\n\r\nThe history of the invasion year may be concluded with a brief notice\r\nof the fate of Thurot. He escaped from Dunkirk with five ships on the\r\n17th October, and made his way to the coast of Norway. From thence\r\nhe came down to the Hebrides early in 1760. Two of his vessels were\r\ndisabled by weather at different times and left him. On the 20th\r\nFebruary he appeared off Carrickfergus in the north of Ireland, and\r\ntook the place. On the 28th of the same month Captain Elliot of the\r\n=Eolus=, with two other frigates, fell in with the three Frenchmen and\r\ntook them after a sharp fight, in which Thurot, a brave humane man\r\nworthy of a better service and a better fate, lost his life. And so\r\nwent out the last spark of the French scheme for the destruction of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWhen darkness closed down on the Bay of Quiberon on the 20th November,\r\nthe great operations of naval warfare came to an end, for there was\r\nno longer any fleet to meet ours at sea. The navy had duty to do\r\nboth during 1759 and afterwards in co-operating with the army in the\r\nconquest of French possessions. But its work, however indispensable,\r\nwas ancillary, and a repetition of the same tale with the same moral\r\nwould be tedious. I shall therefore, as in the case of the operations\r\nof the reigns of King William and Queen Anne, simply give a list of the\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\n +----------------------------------------------------+----------+------------+\r\n |                 Expedition.                        |   When   |  When      |\r\n |                                                    |   Begun  |  Ended     |\r\n +----------------------------------------------------+----------+------------+\r\n | Commodore Moore and Major-General Hopson           |  End of  | May 1759.  |\r\n | attack Martinique unsuccessfully, and Guadaloupe   | November |            |\r\n | successfully.

In this struggle the navy played\r\na very essential part. The scene of its labours and final triumph,\r\nwas on the eastern or Coromandel coast of the Indian Peninsula. Here\r\nthe course of the war was dictated to a very large extent by certain\r\nphysical conditions. From March to October is the season of the S.W. or\r\nrainy monsoon. Then the wind is favourable to all ships entering the\r\nBay of Bengal. It blows away from the land and renders the coast safe.\r\nImmediately under the land, however, there is a belt of water subject\r\nto variable winds, which blow alternately on to the land from the S.E.\r\nand off it from the S. or W. When the wind is from the S.E. the sea\r\nbecomes rough, and the coast, being very ill provided with harbours, is\r\ndangerous. All currents during this season flow strongly to the north.\r\nThus the tendency of wind and water alike is to carry all ships into\r\nthe Bay, and to make the Coromandel coast safe. After October and\r\ntill the end of February comes the season of the N.E. monsoon, which,\r\nblowing on to the land, makes a rough sea and a dangerous coast, and\r\nalso tends to blow all ships out of the Bay of Bengal. Thus in the\r\nordinary course of trade vessels would come in with the S.W. monsoon,\r\nand arrange to start so as to get the help of the N.E. monsoon on\r\ntheir homeward voyage. Thus too the period of operation for fighting\r\nfleets would be during the S.W. monsoon, since at that time the coast\r\nwas safe, and both sides would take the opportunity to send out\r\nreinforcements to its garrisons on shore, while its commerce would be\r\ncoming in at the beginning and going out at the end of the period. With\r\nthe N.E. monsoon all sails disappeared from the Bay of Bengal—those of\r\ncommerce on their homeward voyage, those of war to their respective\r\nports, which for the French meant the island of Mauritius, and for the\r\nEnglish, Bombay on the western or Malabar coast. Here, as in Europe,\r\nwe had an advantage of position. The Malabar coast is nearer the\r\nCoromandel than is the Mauritius, and therefore the British squadron,\r\nwhen directed with common energy, could always be at the scene of\r\noperations before its opponent, and could be placed so as to intercept\r\nall French forces on their way to Pondicherry.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the co-operation of Admiral Watson\r\nand Clive in the suppression of Geriah early in 1756. They reached\r\nMadras on the 20th June, one day before the taking of Calcutta by\r\nSuraj-ud-Daulah and the tragedy of the Black Hole. The vengeance for\r\nthis outrage is one of the most famous stories in our history. But it\r\nbelongs to the history of the East India Company rather than to that\r\nof the navy. Against an enemy who possessed no ships, the fleet could\r\nonly act by providing for the transport of troops, covering their\r\nlanding, attacking forts on the coast, and landing stores or naval\r\nbrigades. Admiral Watson did his share in the work actively in the\r\nearly months of 1757, and he was passively consenting to the fraud\r\nby which his name was forged for the purpose of cheating Omichand. A\r\nsmall naval brigade shared in the battle of Plassey. In any case the\r\nsudden extension of British power which came out of the overthrow of\r\nSuraj-ud-Daulah, would probably have led to a renewal of the conflict\r\nwith the French Company, but hostilities were precipitated by the\r\nEuropean and American quarrels of the two countries. In March 1757 the\r\nFrench fort at Chandernagore, just above Calcutta, was occupied after a\r\nsharp fight, in the midst of the complicated negotiations and conflicts\r\nwith the Nabob of Bengal. Admiral Watson did not live to take part in\r\nthe naval conflict with the French, but died in September of 1757. He\r\nwas succeeded by Rear-Admiral George Pocock, to whom it fell to command\r\nat sea in the decisive struggle for supremacy in India.\r\n\r\nNo attempt will be made here to describe the series of battles\r\nfought during 1758 and 1759. These actions present little more\r\nthan a weary repetition of examples of the working of the pedantic\r\nFighting Instructions. Though Pocock was unquestionably a man of great\r\nenergy, strong mind, and the utmost zeal for the service, he wanted\r\nthe originality and independence of intellect to break away from\r\nthe traditional method. Thus action after action presents the same\r\nmonotonous picture. The British squadron works to windward to secure\r\nthe power to force on battle, and comes down in line to engage the\r\nenemy from end to end. The French wait for the attack, fire to cripple\r\nthe rigging of those of our vessels which present themselves first to\r\nits blows, and then slip away, damaged more or less severely, but never\r\nso seriously that they cannot reach the port they are steering for,\r\nwhile our crews are knotting, splicing, and replacing ropes and spars.\r\nIt was by no single well-delivered blow, by no telling victory that we\r\nfinally forced our opponent out of the Indian Seas, but by persistence,\r\nby a better average of practical seamanship, by the possession of\r\ngreater resources—by, as it were, slowly pushing him in front of us as\r\nby a steady application of weight.\r\n\r\nThe conflict on the sea blazed up in 1758. The French Government had\r\nrealised the necessity for making an effort to preserve its East\r\nIndian possessions in 1757. A squadron was fitted out at Brest under\r\nM. D’Aché, and sailed on the 6th March. It was driven back by bad\r\nweather, and two of the vessels belonging to it were taken to serve\r\nin America with M. Dubois de Lamotte. On the 4th May M. D’Aché sailed\r\nagain with one king’s ship and five belonging to the Company, carrying\r\nwith him a body of troops under the headlong and passionate Lally, the\r\nmost unhappy and one of the least wise of the Irishmen who have been\r\nthe enemies to this country. The dates of D’Aché’s cruise illustrate\r\nthe slow progress of fleets at that time. He reached Rio on the 23rd\r\nJuly, and remained there for two months to recruit the health of his\r\ncrews—no unusual stoppage in the Indian voyages of the period. He\r\nreached the Île de France on the 28th December, and sailed for India\r\non the 27th January 1758. On the 26th April he reached the coast of\r\nCoromandel—little less than a year after he had left Brest. While\r\nD’Aché was slowly sailing to the East, Pocock had been reinforced in\r\nMarch by Commodore Charles Stevens, and his squadrons had been raised\r\nto seven vessels of from fifty to sixty-four guns. He knew that a\r\nFrench force was on its way and must be now approaching the coast of\r\nCoromandel. On the 17th April he sailed from Madras and worked to the\r\nsouthward in search of the enemy, but did not succeed in meeting him.\r\nD’Aché had passed unseen and had anchored at Carical, a French post to\r\nthe south of the English station of Cuddalore, which is to the south\r\nof Pondicherry. Pondicherry itself is well to the south of Madras.\r\nThe French officer had with him eight vessels—for he had found some\r\nat the Île de France—one more than Pocock, but only his flagship the\r\n_Zodiaque_, 74, was a warship. The other seven were vessels belonging\r\nto the French East India Company, were built for trade as well as\r\nfighting, and even if they carried their full nominal armaments\r\nof forty-four, fifty, or fifty-four guns, inferior in solidity to\r\nPocock’s. The one ship more of the French would barely put them on an\r\nequality with our squadron.\r\n\r\nFrom Carical D’Aché sent on Lally to assume his government at\r\nPondicherry, and he himself struck at the English station of Cuddalore.\r\nHe had the good fortune to cut off two small vessels, the =Triton=\r\nand =Bridgewater=, which were driven ashore under the citadel of the\r\nplace, Fort St. David. Meanwhile Pocock was coming back from his\r\nunsuccessful cruise to the South. On the 29th April the two fleets\r\nsighted one another, and a confused action ensued. The dull rules of\r\nthe Fighting Instructions were badly executed by some of Pocock’s\r\ncaptains, and one of D’Aché’s officers showed downright cowardice.\r\nAfter the usual cannonade the two fleets separated in the customary\r\nrespective conditions of British and French squadrons after an action\r\nfought according to rule. The French, whose ships were crowded with\r\nLally’s soldiers, had a heavy list of killed and wounded, because we\r\npreferred to fire at our enemy’s hull. In the British squadron several\r\nvessels were so crippled in their rigging as to be unmanageable. D’Aché\r\nanchored at Alamparva, north of Pondicherry, where one of his vessels\r\nbecame a wreck in the surf. Pocock went on to Madras to refit and bring\r\nthree of his captains to court martial. One was dismissed the service,\r\nand the other two sentenced to lesser penalties. The incident is an\r\nexample of that wholesome severity which, by assigning to every man a\r\ndefinite responsibility and calling on him to answer for every failure,\r\nhas established the magnificent discipline of the Royal Navy, and has\r\nbeen the austere parent of its splendid efficiency.\r\n\r\nFrom Alamparva D’Aché went to Pondicherry and landed his soldiers and\r\nhis numerous sick and wounded. At the close of May Pocock appeared\r\noff the port. The French Admiral, whose squadron was ill fitted, had\r\nrecourse to every device to avoid action, and all the rabid driving\r\nof Lally could not make him incur risks. As the authorities at Madras\r\nwere rendered nervous for their safety by the strength of the French\r\nmilitary force they recalled Pocock, and thus enabled D’Aché to\r\nco-operate with Lally in the capture of Fort St. David in June. In\r\nJuly, however, the admiral was back off Pondicherry seeking battle.\r\nD’Aché would fain have avoided a meeting and have returned at once\r\nto the Île de France. Prayers and threats from the authorities and\r\nLally induced him to stay, and to play a game of hide-and-seek in\r\nthe calms and varying inshore winds of the coast. On the 3rd August,\r\nafter infinite confusing movements and varying breezes, another barren\r\ncannonade took place off Negapatam. Again both admirals anchored,\r\nPocock at Carical and D’Aché at Pondicherry. On the 3rd September the\r\nFrenchman sailed for the Île de France, and the sea being now clear\r\nof enemies, Pocock went round to Bombay to avoid the storms of the\r\nnorth-easterly monsoon.\r\n\r\nThis campaign has certain features of interest. Though Pocock’s arms\r\nwere tied by the Fighting Instructions, he showed a vigour in attack\r\nand a persistency of effort which promised final victory over his timid\r\nopponent. But the working of those instructions is full of warning.\r\nIt has been ingeniously argued by the late Admiral Colomb that the\r\npresence of an effective naval force, for which he invented—or to\r\nwhich he adapted—the name of “Fleet in Being,” on a given coast will\r\nof itself so act as to stop all operations against that coast on the\r\npart of an enemy. Yet in this case, though the British squadron was\r\nat least a full match for the French, and Pocock’s will to strike\r\nwas of the best, we see that he failed both to prevent D’Aché from\r\nlanding soldiers at Pondicherry and from co-operating in the taking\r\nof Cuddalore. He failed partly because of the timidity of the Council\r\nwhich called him back to Madras, but mainly because he was tied by\r\nformal rules of battle which did not allow him to develop freely the\r\nwhole strength of his command. Had he been free to take his fleet\r\nalways where he thought best, and to use it unbound by foolish laws,\r\nhad he been one of those great and original captains who have the moral\r\nand intellectual courage to break away from worn-out traditions, there\r\ncan be no doubt that his campaign of 1758 on the coast of Coromandel\r\nwould have been marked by a decisive battle. It might well have been\r\nfar more costly than the two engagements actually fought, but we may\r\nassert, without undue patriotic confidence in our own navy, that it\r\nwould have broken the French naval forces in those seas to pieces. As\r\nit was, the balance of advantage was rather with the French than with\r\nus. The moral of the story is surely, that it is not enough for a fleet\r\nto be “in being” if it is not also in action, and that there is but\r\nlittle use in action which is not allowed to drive its blows home to\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\nThe operations of 1759 bear some likeness to those of the previous\r\nyear, but with a marked difference. Our squadron well supplied,\r\nstrictly disciplined, grew in strength, efficiency, and confidence.\r\nD’Aché was joined at the Île de France by ships of the navy from Europe\r\ncommanded by Froger de l’Eguille, who had taken part in the action with\r\nByng. But his very numbers were an embarrassment to him. The French\r\nislands were too poor to feed the crews of the squadron. They were\r\nonly kept from starvation by sending some of the ships to buy food\r\nat a great cost from the Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope, and others\r\nto live from hand to mouth on the coast of Madagascar. Stores were\r\nalmost wholly wanting, and the work of refitting the vessels was either\r\nnot done at all, or was done by sacrificing one necessary to serve as\r\nmakeshift for another. It is therefore not surprising that whereas\r\nPocock was back from the Malabar coast and was cruising in the Bay of\r\nBengal in April, D’Aché was unable to leave the islands till the middle\r\nof July. He was near Batacaloa on the east coast of Ceylon at the end\r\nof August. He had eleven ships to Pocock’s eight, but many were weak,\r\nall were badly fitted, and there was little heart or confidence in\r\nofficers or men. To a large extent his crews were natives. The utmost\r\nhe felt able to do was to carry some reinforcements to Pondicherry, and\r\nhis ambition did not reach beyond effecting this service without being\r\nbrought to battle if he could. When then he was sighted by Pocock on\r\nthe coast of Ceylon, he applied himself to slipping away and succeeded.\r\nThe British admiral, having lost sight of him, hastened to cut his road\r\nat Pondicherry, and another scene of cannonading, of damaged rigging\r\nfor us, and of final escape for the French, took place on the 10th\r\nSeptember. D’Aché reached Pondicherry while our ropes and spars were\r\nbeing repaired at Negapatam. During the rest of the month the British\r\nadmiral made successive attempts to provoke his opponent to battle. The\r\nfurious Lally, whose one idea of government was to lay about him with\r\na flail, strove hard to get service out of his naval colleague. But\r\nD’Aché, who was deep in the ruinous intrigues of the French settlement,\r\nwould do nothing. He would not even stay on the coast though prayed\r\nto do so by his countrymen. His officers were as eager to be gone as\r\nhimself. At the end of September he sailed for the islands, and the\r\nFrench flag disappeared from those seas. When his opponent was gone\r\nPocock went round to Bombay. From thence he sailed for home with a\r\ngreat convoy, and arrived on the 22nd September. The naval war was at\r\nan end in the East Indies by the utter collapse of the French. Their\r\npossessions being cut off from help, fell before the superior forces of\r\nthe English company.\r\n\r\nPocock was rewarded by the immensely lucrative command of the fleet\r\nwhich sailed in the combined expedition against Havana in 1762, when\r\nSpain, in a moment of Royal folly, was dragged into the war against us.\r\nOn that enterprise and of the contemporaneous expedition which Pocock’s\r\nsuccessor in the East Indies command, Cornish, led against Manila,\r\nno more will be said here than that they were marked by a loyalty of\r\nco-operation between sailor and soldier which was then a novelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN WAR TILL 1780\r\n\r\n AUTHORITIES.—See authorities for previous years; Mundy’s _Life\r\n     and Correspondence of Lord Rodney_; Barrow’s _Life of Howe_;\r\n     Chevalier, _Histoire de la Marine Française pendant la guerre\r\n     d’independence Americaine_; _Parliamentary History_; _Annual\r\n     Register_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interval of fifteen years which separates the end of the Seven\r\nYears’ War from the beginning of the American War in 1778 saw no\r\nchange in the organisation of the navy. An improvement in their\r\nhalf pay was given to the captains in 1773. In 1715 the right to\r\nenjoy half pay when not on active service, which had hitherto been\r\nlimited to twenty-five officers of this rank, was extended to all.\r\nThe amount had come to appear insufficient by 1773, and the captains\r\npetitioned Parliament for relief. Their case was stated by Howe, who\r\nwas then member for Dartmouth. Lord North, the Prime Minister, began\r\nby opposing the motion, on the ground that it affected the revenue,\r\nand ought therefore to have been made by a minister. But the sympathy\r\nof the house was with Howe and his clients. A committee of inquiry\r\nwas appointed, and on its report Parliament decided that the increase\r\nought to be granted. A sum of £7000 was finally voted, and the scale\r\nof half pay was fixed at 10s. a day for 50 captains, 8s. for 30, and\r\n6s. for all the others, in their order of seniority. Howe and the more\r\nfortunate naval officers, who were members of the House of Commons\r\nand who gave him support, acted an honourable part on behalf of their\r\nbrothers in arms. They would have done still better if they had gone on\r\nto represent the far more cruel grievances of the men. Had they acted\r\nwith spirit for those fellow-seamen who did not belong to their own\r\nclass, they might have secured a hearing, and have saved the navy from\r\nthe long list of mutinies which were to disgrace the coming war. But so\r\nmuch magnanimity and foresight was perhaps not to be expected in those\r\nyears of the eighteenth century. Nothing was done for the sailors. The\r\nisolated mutinies were sometimes suppressed with severity, but were\r\nsometimes concealed from public knowledge, and condoned. A long course\r\nof neglect and weakness, with now and then a spasm of ferocity, bore\r\nits natural fruit in the combined mutiny at Spithead in 1797.\r\n\r\nThe discipline of the navy continued to benefit by the admirable\r\nwork done in the Seven Years’ War by the great chiefs and the less\r\nfamous officers whom they inspired. Their influence and example went\r\non bearing good fruit, and have indeed never ceased to be felt, but\r\nhave been carried from one generation to another of their successors.\r\nRemote from the corruption of the dockyards and the fury of political\r\nfactions on shore, on solitary voyages, in long cruises, in blockades,\r\nin battle and storm, the admirals and captains who were trained in the\r\nschools of Anson and Hawke, Pocock and Boscawen, and were themselves\r\nto train the admirals and captains of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic\r\nWars, went on perfecting the seamanship and fighting efficiency of the\r\nfleet. An anonymous officer, who wrote in 1788, could declare in answer\r\nto those who boasted of the ancient discipline of the navy, that “if\r\nwe compare the past practices and methods, as they have been explained\r\nto us thirty years ago by old seamen in the service, with the present,\r\nwe shall find, that in no one thing under the British Government has\r\nthere been so much improvement as in the art of fighting, sailing,\r\nand navigating a British ship of War.” The reason he gives is full of\r\ninstruction, and deserves to be quoted at length:—\r\n\r\n “The old method of enforcing discipline was without method, by\r\n main strength and the frequent use of the rattan, without which no\r\n officer, from the captain down to the youngest midshipman, ever went\r\n upon deck. Even twenty years ago there was much of this discipline\r\n (if it can be called by the name) remaining in the service. Last war\r\n [_i.e._ between 1778 and 1783] there is no doubt that the internal\r\n discipline of His Majesty’s ships in general was brought to as great\r\n a degree of perfection, almost, as it is capable of receiving; I say\r\n in general. There were indeed exceptions; but in captains bigoted\r\n to the old customs, and whose ships might always be distinguished by\r\n their awkwardness and inactivity and by the indifferent figure they\r\n cut in action, though commanded with bravery. This general improvement\r\n proceeded from a method adopted in every branch of an officer’s and\r\n sailor’s duty, by dividing and quartering the officers with the men,\r\n and making them responsible for the performance of that portion of the\r\n duty allotted them, without noise, or the brutal method of driving\r\n sailors like cattle with sticks. Whether it were to make or shorten\r\n sail, to manœuvre the ship, to keep the men clean clothed, clean\r\n bedded, and berthed, this method was practised.”\r\n\r\nThe writer attributes the efficiency of the crews and the good\r\nhealth they enjoyed even in the West Indies, while under the command\r\nof Rodney and Hood, to this more humane and intelligent system. He\r\nclaims that there were cases when out of twenty-two sail of the line\r\ncruising together, there were not twenty-two men who could not come to\r\nquarters. The reader who compares this with the terrible ravages made\r\nby fever and scurvy in the naval expeditions of Queen Anne’s reign and\r\nthe beginning of the Seven Years’ War will see how vast had been the\r\nchange for the better. The example of Captain Cook and the exertions\r\nof Rodney’s doctor, Gilbert Blane, brought about improvements in the\r\ndiet of the men which saved thousands for the service of their country,\r\nwho would have been thrown to the sharks in former times. All this\r\nreform was the spontaneous work of the navy. There was so little about\r\nit of Admiralty system that no universal system of quartering men and\r\ndividing work was established till far into the nineteenth century.\r\nCaptains followed the practice of the officers under whom they had\r\nfirst served, with improvements of their own. The perfected discipline\r\nof the navy was the result of the labours of hundreds of officers, many\r\nof whom are completely forgotten, thinking, experimenting, and toiling,\r\neach in his own sphere, but all with the same noble love of good work.\r\nTherefore it had, and has, a grand life of its own, incomparably\r\nhigher, and far more enduring than the mechanical order enforced by\r\na minister or king. “It is the service” was the most emphatic praise\r\na naval officer could give, and “It is not the service” his most\r\nsevere condemnation. “The Service” was the formula standing for that\r\ncombination of smartness, of cleanliness, of precision of movement, of\r\nexactness of stroke, of resolution to endure, and of intrepidity to\r\nventure, which is the glory of the navy, its strength, and the real\r\nexplanation of its triumphs. It is of this too that the nation has\r\nthe best reason to be proud. There is something rather servile and\r\nmore than rather blind in the habit of attributing all success to the\r\ncommander. In the long run the Roman Legion will wear down Hannibal,\r\nand it is a greater feat for any people to produce the organism which\r\nis animated by the virtue of tens of thousands of its sons, than the\r\nexceptional leader, whose genius does not always last even for the\r\nwhole of his own life. We do well to put up monuments to Nelson, and\r\nit would be to our honour to remember other admirals more fully than\r\nwe do. The navy itself is the living memorial raised to the generation\r\nof forgotten men whose names have passed into forgetfulness, but whose\r\nwork lives to this day on the quarter-decks and forecastles of every\r\nship flying the cross of St. George.\r\n\r\nWhile the seamen were steadily perfecting the discipline of the navy,\r\ntheir rulers on shore were allowing the administration to drift back to\r\nthe corruptions of Walpole’s time. The cause of this unhappy reaction\r\nis easily stated. George III. came to the throne with the determination\r\nto be king. This meant that he would not consent to be a puppet in the\r\nhands of the Whig oligarchy of Revolution families, who had dominated\r\nhis grandfather. He could not crush them by the use of force, and was\r\nconsequently compelled to fight them with their own weapons, which were\r\ninterest and corruption. Interest meant that he bought the obedience of\r\nMembers of the House of Commons by bribery. Every branch of the public\r\nservice, and the Royal Household also, suffered because places were\r\ngiven to buy votes, and no reform could be effected without losing the\r\nsupport of members of Parliament who profited by the abuse. The evil\r\nwas particularly bad in the navy. Parliamentary boroughs and dockyard\r\nseats were regularly filled with henchmen of the king’s ministers, on\r\nthe understanding that they gave their help to suppress inquiry. Money\r\nvoted with a great appearance of precision for specific purposes was\r\nnot applied to the ends for which it was in theory granted. What became\r\nof it nobody was ever able to discover. On paper the system of accounts\r\nwas so rigid that fraud might have appeared to be impossible, but its\r\nvery severity made it cumbersome, and the men in office were not even\r\nhonest. When taxed with misuse of the nation’s money they were in the\r\nhabit of boasting that they did not take it for themselves. It is\r\nprobable that they did not put it directly into their own pockets, but\r\ntheir defence was sophistical. Corruption was needed to keep them in\r\nplace—and place was lucrative. Every department had its own treasury.\r\nThe money paid out by the Exchequer was put to the account of the\r\nminister. The bankers paid interest on it, and this interest was the\r\nperquisite of the members of the ministry. It was their interest to\r\ndelay payments and conceal the actual use made of the funds. Brougham\r\nrepeats a story which illustrates the spirit of the politicians of that\r\ngeneration. When Lord North was appointed Paymaster of the Forces he\r\nfound that he had to divide the emoluments with another politician. His\r\ndisgust was great, and he revenged himself by a characteristic jest. A\r\ndog made a mess in the passage outside his room. Lord North sent for\r\none of the servants, ordered him to carry the offensive matter away,\r\nand take care that his colleague received his due share, for said he,\r\n“Mr. Cooke is to have half of everything that comes into the office.”\r\n\r\nWhen the war with France came in 1778 the mischief had been in full\r\nswing for seven years under the administration of Lord Sandwich, which\r\nbegan in 1771. During that period he had received for the building and\r\nequipping of the navy £6,472,072, besides large sums charged on the\r\ndebt. This was nearly twice as much as had been voted between 1755 and\r\n1762, and considerably more than a million beyond the votes of 1763 to\r\n1771. These sums did not cover the whole expense of maintaining the\r\nnavy. The supplies were voted under three heads. There was the Ordinary\r\nof the Navy, which meant the maintenance of the dockyards, care of the\r\nships not in commission, and half pay. Then there was the Extraordinary\r\nof the navy, the “building, rebuilding, and repairs” and all “extra\r\nworks over and above what was meant to be done upon the heads of wear\r\nand tear in ordinary.” The third vote was for so many men at £4 a head\r\nper month of twenty-eight days. Of this sum £1, 16s. was for wages of\r\nall ranks, 19s. for rations, and the balance covered current expenses\r\nin replacing rigging and ammunition. This was naturally the largest\r\nsum of all. The votes for 1779 for example were respectively: for the\r\nOrdinary, £369,882, 6s. 1d.; for the Extraordinary, £579,187; and\r\nfor 70,000 men “for 13 months, including ordnance,” £3,640,000. The\r\n£6,472,072 supplied to Sandwich between 1771 and 1778 did not include\r\nthe vote for men. Though the sum was so considerable, the Admiralty was\r\nunable to find fifty line-of-battle ships for sea in the summer of 1778.\r\n\r\nWhy so much money produced such unsatisfactory results was well shown\r\nin the course of a discussion in the Commons on the 13th January of\r\nthis year. Mr. Temple Luttrell quoted figures to show that as much\r\nhad been voted for the repairs of the =Namur=, the =Defence=, and the\r\n=Arrogant=, as would have built them new from the keel at the most\r\nextravagant rate. Yet they were not fit for service. An even more\r\nscandalous case was that of the =Dragon=, 74. She had been launched in\r\n1760 in the heat of the Seven Years’ War, and was one of the vessels\r\nthen hastily constructed of green timber to meet a pressing need. They\r\nwere rotten by 1771, and Sandwich was in the habit of taking credit\r\nto himself for his exertion to replace them by better ships. What had\r\nhappened with the =Dragon= was this—that between 1771 and 1778 the\r\nAdmiralty came to Parliament for successive sums, amounting to £27,000,\r\nfor her repairs, and £10,273 for her stores. Yet in the latter year\r\nshe was notoriously lying in a rotten state at the head of Portsmouth\r\nHarbour, and not one penny of this money had ever been spent upon her.\r\nThe facts were not disputed. All that the Sea Lords, who answered\r\nfor the Admiralty, could say was, that they had not pilfered the\r\nmoney themselves, and that this sort of thing had always been done.\r\nThe answer was, that it was directly contrary to the representation\r\nof the House of Commons in 1711. It was on this occasion that Burke\r\nthrew the book of the estimates across the Speaker’s table, knocking\r\nover a candle, and all but breaking the shins of the Treasurer of\r\nthe Navy, Welbore Ellis. He said, that it was “treating the House\r\nwith the utmost contempt, to present them with a fine gilt book of\r\nestimates, calculated to the last farthing, for purposes to which\r\nthe money granted was never meant to be applied.” Burke was right,\r\nbut the Whig Opposition had done nothing to amend the evil in its\r\ndays of power, and had little right to take a lofty moral line with\r\nits successors. Contempt was the exact word for the attitude taken\r\ntowards all criticism by Sir Hugh Palliser and Lord Mulgrave, the\r\nnaval representatives of the Admiralty in the Lower House. Palliser\r\nwas arrogant and laconic, lying as to the state of the fleet with a\r\nburly assurance. Lord Mulgrave, the Irish peer, better remembered as\r\nthe Captain Constantine Phipps, with whom Nelson made his early voyage\r\nto Spitzbergen, was fluent, jocular, and insolent. A docile majority\r\nsupported them by voting “the previous question” as the most convenient\r\nway of stifling inquiry.\r\n\r\nIndignant contemporary critics declared that accounts made in this\r\nfashion were in fact deliberately designed to “envelope in utter\r\ndarkness the true appropriation of the immense sums they (the Ministers\r\nto wit) extort thereupon from the public.” The respective shares of\r\ndeliberate design and mere convenient use and wont in producing the\r\ndisorder present a nice question. What is beyond dispute is, that when\r\nthe gilt book of the estimates showed the expenditure of such and such\r\nsums for repairs and stores, and when the money was devoted to other\r\npurposes, and the vessels named were lying rotten and unfit for sea,\r\nit must have been impossible even for the best informed officials\r\nto know the effective strength of the navy. Indeed, nothing is more\r\ndifficult than to find what was the real available force of the fleet\r\nat this crisis. The common printed authorities, Beatson’s _Naval and\r\nMilitary Memoirs_, Schomberg’s _Chronicle_, and Derrick’s _Memoirs of\r\nthe Royal Navy_ (all good books in their different ways), contradict\r\none another. It is only natural they should, for there were no accurate\r\nsources of information. It was not till 1773 that the Admiralty itself\r\nbegan to try to take stock of its vessels. In that year it was ordered\r\nthat a return, to be known as the “Progress of the Dockyards,” should\r\nbe made every week, showing what ships of all classes were under the\r\ncare of the officials. There was also a monthly list of ships in full\r\nsea pay. It ought to have been possible to make an exact return of the\r\nstrength of the navy by adding the one to the other. But these papers\r\nwere avowedly untrustworthy. A ship in full sea pay, or commission,\r\nmight go into the dockyard for repairs. She would then appear in the\r\nWeekly Progresses, and if the totals alone were looked to, she would be\r\ncounted twice. Then a vessel was considered to be in full sea pay when\r\nher captain was appointed, but months might pass before he joined her,\r\nand in the meantime she lay unmanned. So she, again, would be included\r\ntwice. The Weekly Progresses were drawn up by the clerks of the Navy\r\nOffice, and the monthly lists by the Admiralty officials. They were\r\nindependent and might not agree. Some allowance must be made for mere\r\nblunders. It is obvious, too, that the dockyards returned such rotten\r\nhulks as H.M.S. =Dragon= among the ships under their charge, while\r\nthe fact that a man-of-war was in full sea pay hardly established a\r\npresumption that she was manned, rigged, or as much as in good repair.\r\nThese official papers are therefore but blind guides. When the great\r\nreform of the navy administration was begun in the early years of the\r\nnineteenth century, a manuscript book called the “Progress of the Navy\r\nfrom 1765 to 1806” was compiled in the Admiralty. The author warns all\r\nwho may use it that his sources were untrustworthy, but he professes to\r\nhave done his best to get at the truth and to have made the necessary\r\ndeductions. It may be accepted as giving the nearest attainable\r\napproach to an exact statement of the paper strength of the navy during\r\nthe years which it covers.\r\n\r\nAccording to this authority, the total nominal force of the Royal Navy\r\nin January 1778 was 399 vessels, of which 274 were in full sea pay, or\r\ncommission, while 125 were in ordinary, or reserve. The usual phrase of\r\nthe time was “lying by the walls”—that is to say, in the dockyards. The\r\nadvance during the war will be seen from the following list:—\r\n\r\n +------------------+---------------+--------------+\r\n |                  | Vessels in    | Total of all |\r\n |                  | Full Sea Pay. |   Vessels.   |\r\n +------------------+---------------+--------------+\r\n | 1st January 1778 |      274      |     399      |\r\n |  \"    \"     1779 |      317      |     432      |\r\n |  \"    \"     1780 |      364      |     481      |\r\n |  \"    \"     1781 |      396      |     538      |\r\n |  \"    \"     1782 |      398      |     551      |\r\n |  \"    \"     1783 |      430      |     608      |\r\n +------------------+---------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nThis, however, is paper strength. It includes battered hulks fit only\r\nfor harbour duty, prizes needing a refit, yachts and ships building.\r\nEven at the very end of the war such authorities as Keppel and Howe\r\ncould not agree as to the number of vessels really available for\r\nservice. Ships were put into commission simply in order to please\r\nsupporters by conferring professional favours on them, their relations,\r\nor clients. A great display of pennants might be made by this device,\r\nbut it was a show out of all proportion to the effective strength.\r\nThen, as in much later times, it was the dishonest official practice\r\nto include vessels building in the list of the navy. Thus, in the\r\nlast year of the war, it was said that we had four first-rates of 100\r\nguns. In reality there had been three, which were reduced to two by\r\nthe sinking of the =Royal George= at Spithead. Another was ordered to\r\nreplace her, and a fourth, the =Queen Charlotte=, which afterwards\r\ncarried Howe’s flag on the 1st June, was also begun. They were not\r\nready for years, but they were counted in to make up the tale of four.\r\n\r\nWhere our evidence is confessedly not sound, it is idle to make\r\nconfident assertions about the strength of the fleet. But the sea pay\r\nlists represent what was the utmost claimed by the Government as ready\r\nfor immediate service. The figures for the beginning and the end of\r\n1778 will show what was the disposition of the fleet, and also what was\r\nthe first effect of the outbreak of hostilities with France.\r\n\r\n       January 1778.

The high\r\nfigure of the North American station came from the use of numbers\r\nof small craft to co-operate with the troops employed against the\r\ninsurgents from 1775 onwards. In the main, however, the second list\r\ndiffers from the first by the addition of the Western Squadron—that\r\nis, the great force of battleships collected under Keppel to meet the\r\nFrench at Brest.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that there is an increase in the vessels employed on\r\n“Convoy and Cruising.” We tell only half the service of a navy in war\r\nwhen we confine ourselves to the movements of the squadrons and the\r\nbattles. The other half consists in the patrol duty done to protect\r\ntrade and keep down the enemy’s attacks on commerce. To explain it\r\nby narrative would be tedious and confusing to the reader, but the\r\nfollowing list of the warships of various classes employed in this way\r\nat and about home when the war began will help the reader to realise\r\nhow the duty was provided for:—\r\n\r\nCRUISERS\r\n\r\n Ship.

The\r\n=Resolution= and =Discovery= were the ships of Captain Cook, then on\r\nhis last voyage. It must be remembered that these lists represent the\r\ncruisers and convoy ships at home or sent directly from home. On every\r\nstation the admiral would detail part of his command for such duties as\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nThe manning of the navy continued to present the old difficulties,\r\naggravated by the fact that we had lost the services of the thousands\r\nof American seamen who had been found in our ships in the last war.\r\nThey were now manning the privateers which preyed on our commerce as\r\nfar abroad as the Channel and the Mediterranean. All the old complaints\r\nwere heard of the cruelty, the unconstitutional character, and the\r\ninefficiency of the press. A Bill to abolish it was introduced and\r\nfavourably received in the House of Commons, but went no further. The\r\nfact is that the press was indispensable. We would not train men in\r\npeace. The merchant seamen would never enlist of their free will in\r\nthe navy, and were the less likely to do so because the first effect\r\nof a war was to send up wages in the trading-ships. But the press was\r\nnot only needed for the sailors. They indeed were sought by it with\r\nparticular zeal, because their skill was indispensable in the ships\r\nas riggers and to set an example to other men in handling masts and\r\nsails in all conditions of weather. It was on them, too, that the\r\ncaptain relied in the greater perils of navigation. But they never\r\nformed the bulk of the crews of our warships, nor was it possible they\r\nshould. In a debate on the Bill to abolish the Press, held on 11th\r\nMarch 1777, Lord Mulgrave declared that the total number of seamen\r\nin the country was only 60,000, while the number required for the\r\nnavy in war had sometimes risen to 80,000. If the whole body of our\r\nmerchant seamen had been swept into the navy and their places in our\r\ntrading-ships taken by foreigners who swarmed in to earn the high war\r\nwages, there would still have been a deficiency. In truth we never\r\nsecured all the merchant sailors. The list of men rated as seamen was\r\nmade up by taking landsmen, who either volunteered or were impressed,\r\nand were not uncommonly vagabonds and jail-birds. Though all might\r\nbe known officially by the same name, a wide distinction was always\r\nmade among the crews themselves, and in the opinion of the officers,\r\nbetween the “prime seamen” who had served their apprenticeship in the\r\nlong sea voyages and could turn their hand to anything, and the mere\r\n“man-of-warsman,” who had not been bred to the sea and had only been\r\ntaught the work of his particular station. It was inevitable that in\r\ncrews composed in this fashion there should have been wide differences\r\nof quality and that some of their elements were worthless and criminal.\r\nNeither was it denied by the representatives of the Admiralty that\r\nthis was the case. On the 11th November of 1777, Mr. Temple Luttrell\r\nsaid in the Commons, “Your bounties procure few good seamen, and your\r\npress warrants, though enormously expensive, fewer still, while great\r\nnumbers are daily deserting from your ships and hospitals to commit\r\nrobberies and murders in the interior counties.... I am assured that\r\nfifty have lately deserted from the =Monarch= while in dock, forty\r\nfrom the =Hector=, and twenty-five from the =Worcester=, six of these\r\nare confined at Winchester for felonies, and there are two committed\r\nto Exeter jail on a charge of murder.” Lord Mulgrave’s answer was that\r\nfifty men had indeed deserted, from the =Monarch=, because Captain\r\nRowley was humanely unwilling to treat his men as slaves, and that the\r\ndeserters were not to be regretted, because “the health of the rest\r\nwas preserved, as the service was freed from a number of men not to be\r\ndepended on.” No reply was given on other points. Lord Mulgrave’s tone\r\nof jaunty flippancy was characteristic of the incompetent Government\r\nwhich led the country unprepared into the most disastrous of its wars.\r\n\r\nYet in 1777 the navy was beginning to reap the benefit of the General\r\nPress warrant issues in October 1776, when the king and his ministers\r\nwere at last forced to recognise that the rebellion in America was very\r\nserious. It was now possible to lay hands on good men by force. Until\r\nthis was the case, our ships were not uncommonly manned in the fashion\r\ndescribed in the following letter from Captain Price of the =Viper=\r\nsloop on the North American station in 1775, as quoted by Beatson in\r\nhis _Naval and Military Memoirs_:—\r\n\r\n “I am very much distressed for Petty officers, as well as Warrants. My\r\n Carpenter infirm and past duty, my Gunner made from a livery servant,\r\n neither seaman nor gunner; my Master a man in years, never an officer\r\n before, made from a boy on board one of the guardships, he then\r\n keeping a public house at Gosport. Petty officers I have but one, who\r\n owns himself mad at times. A Master’s Mate I have not, nor anyone I\r\n can make a Boatswain’s mate. I have not one person I could trust with\r\n the charge of a vessel I might take to bring her in.”\r\n\r\nWhat complication of slovenliness and jobbery there was behind that\r\nmaster who had been borne as a boy on a guardship and yet kept a\r\npublic-house at Gosport, we do not know, but it must be allowed that\r\nH.M.S. =Viper= differed vastly from the smart British man-of-war with\r\nher crew of fine seamen which is supposed to have represented the navy\r\nof the eighteenth century. It is probable, however, that she only\r\ndiffered in degree from the average vessel in commission at a time when\r\njobbery was common, and there was no press at work to sweep in the\r\nthoroughbred seamen.\r\n\r\nWhen our navy was weakened by corrupt administration and political\r\nfaction, it was about to be matched against more formidable foes\r\nthan it had met since the Dutch wars of the seventeenth century. The\r\nAmericans were only privateers, but they were active and skilful. The\r\nFrench joined battle with us in 1778, the Spaniards in the following\r\nyear, and the Dutch in 1780. Of these the first and second were not\r\nonly more numerous but far more efficient than they had been in the two\r\nprevious struggles. The disasters of the Seven Years’ War had stung the\r\npride and patriotism of the French, and they had made serious efforts\r\nto restore their strength at sea. Public subscriptions had been opened\r\nto supply ships, and though the money promised was not always paid,\r\nthey did something to supply the Government with funds. Choiseul, who\r\nwas minister at the end of the war, tried hard to restore the naval\r\nservice. Some of his changes and intended reforms were fantastic and\r\ncould not last. Yet he did not a little to provide ships and to give\r\nthe officers opportunities for practice. When he was driven from office\r\nby the king’s fear that he meant to provoke another war with England,\r\nhis work was for a time lost. But after the death of Louis XV. and\r\nthe accession of Louis XVI. the French Navy became again an object\r\nof attention to the Government. With the encouragement of the young\r\nking, two able ministers, Turgot and M. de Sartine, strove hard to\r\nmake it worthy of the rank of France among nations. These efforts were\r\ngreatly increased as the progress of the American insurrection began to\r\nafford hope that an opportunity would be found to take revenge for the\r\ndisasters of past years. In 1778 the French Navy consisted, according\r\nto official papers, of 122 vessels, of which 73 were of the line. A\r\nvery large proportion of these were new, and were admirably built. The\r\nFrench naval officers had studied hard, and were animated by pride,\r\nboth patriotic and professional, and the desire to retrieve their\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nSpain was a nerveless power, as Burke said years afterwards, and\r\nhad not recovered even in the mere number of her population, still\r\nless in intellect and character, from the terrible exhaustion of the\r\nseventeenth century. Yet her king, Charles III., had tried seriously\r\nto supply his dominions with a navy. Happily for us, he was a man of\r\nlimited intelligence, and made the common mistake of supposing that\r\nnumbers constituted strength. In 1778 his navy presented a list of\r\n141 vessels, in all of which 62 were of the line. Though his liners\r\nwere with few exceptions two-deckers of 60 and 70 guns, they were\r\nfine ships. Some of them had been built by English shipwrights in\r\nthe Spanish service. If Charles III. had been content with forty\r\nline-of-battle ships, and had spent the money economised on the\r\nbuilding vote on giving practice to his squadrons and on forming a\r\ngood corps of seaman gunners, his navy would have been a more serious\r\nopponent than it was. Still, the addition of the sixty-two Spanish\r\nliners with all their defects to the French seventy-three constituted a\r\ncombination able to try the resources of our navy to the utmost.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Navy had fallen far below the standard of its great days. In\r\n1780, when the United Provinces joined the alliance against us, they\r\nhad only twenty-six line-of-battle ships of from 50 to 76 guns, and\r\ntwenty-nine lesser vessels. Great efforts were made to add to this\r\nshort list during the course of the war, but the additions were made\r\ntoo late to have any considerable effect. Holland, too, though it had\r\nnot withered to the same extent as its old enemy Spain, had sunk from\r\nits former energy. Yet the seamanlike skill of the Dutch crews, their\r\nsteady gunnery and phlegmatic valour, made them rank higher in the\r\nopinion of our navy than the French, and far higher than the Spaniards.\r\nThe best contested battle of the war took place between an English and\r\na Dutch squadron.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the great naval war with France in the spring of 1778\r\nwas preceded by three years of warlike operations. They were mainly\r\nof an ancillary character, and the scope of this book does not allow\r\nthem to be told in detail. It must suffice to say that they may be\r\ndivided into two classes. On the Atlantic seaboard and the American\r\nlakes our officers and men were engaged in supporting the military\r\nforces employed to subdue the insurgents, or to repel inroads on\r\nCanada. Captains Douglas and Pringle did good and gallant service\r\nboth in aiding Sir Guy Carleton to repel the invasion of Montgomery\r\nand Arnold, and in clearing the way for Burgoyne’s advance into the\r\nvalley of the Hudson during the autumn of 1777. Here it was possible\r\nto force the enemy to action with the advantage of better discipline\r\nand larger resources in our favour. Less success was achieved along\r\nthe far-stretched seacoast of the plantations. The fault lay to a\r\nvery great extent with the Ministry, which would not recognise the\r\nmagnitude of its task. It estimated the case so ill that in 1775, the\r\nyear of Lexington and Bunker Hill, and of the publication, on the 23rd\r\nAugust, of the proclamation for “Suppressing Rebellion and Sedition\r\nin North America,” it reduced the establishment of the navy. The vote\r\nfor men was cut down by 2000, and the total estimate was lowered from\r\n£2,104,917 to £1,674,059. From this figure it rose to £5,001,895 in\r\n1778. In October 1776 the General Press warrant was issued. The bounty,\r\nthough raised to twelve guineas, failed to draw volunteers. At that\r\ndate there were on the muster books at home 8933 men. By the December\r\nof 1778, and under the strain of stern compulsion, the complements of\r\nour ships had been collected, at least on paper, on an adequate scale.\r\nThe return for the 1st January 1778 is 62,719, and from that level the\r\nnavy advanced to the 107,446 men borne on its books on 1st January 1783.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years from 1775 to 1778 the admirals successively\r\ncommanding on the American station, Samuel Graves, Shuldham, and Howe,\r\nwere endeavouring to overawe hundreds of miles of seacoast swarming\r\nwith active seamen who were thrown out of work by the interruption\r\nof trade. In the summer of 1775 Graves had at his disposal four\r\nline-of-battle ships and twenty-one smaller vessels. If he had been\r\nable to make free use of all of them, they still would have been\r\ninadequate to the work to be done, but he was compelled to keep the\r\nbulk of them together at Boston to support General Gage. Reinforcements\r\ngradually brought the station up to the nine liners, 64- and 50-gun\r\nships, and eighty or so small craft of all kinds which were under the\r\nflag of Howe, who assumed command in July 1776. But he was bound to\r\nattend mainly to the duty of helping his brother, Sir William Howe,\r\nduring the advance to, and occupation of, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe result was precisely what any competent naval adviser would have\r\npredicted. Our admirals were always able to cover the movements of\r\ntroops and to carry out punitive expeditions against seaports. Of\r\nthese there were many, and they were justified by the attacks made by\r\nthe inhabitants on our boats’ crews and small cruisers. But they were\r\nwretched expedients, for they exasperated the enemy without crushing\r\nhim into submission. Meanwhile American armed vessels intercepted\r\nsupplies, cut off our boats, and captured transports—all the more\r\neasily because these last usually sailed without convoy. On one\r\noccasion, in August 1775, the insurgents actually landed in Bahama, and\r\ncarried off a hundred barrels of gunpowder—a very seasonable supply to\r\nGeneral Washington.\r\n\r\nOut of this weakness at home came the second task thrown on the navy.\r\nQuick-sailing American privateers were soon swarming all over the\r\nAtlantic. The French and Spanish Governments professed to maintain\r\nstrict neutrality, and did occasionally take measures to stop the use\r\nof their ports by the Americans, when the king’s Ambassadors were\r\nenergetic in protesting, and could quote a definite instance. But\r\nthey saw our growing embarrassments with glee, and encouraged the\r\nprivateers under hand. With this secret support to help them, and the\r\neven more effectual aid due to the unprepared condition of our navy,\r\nthe privateers cruised with signal success. In 1777 they did heavy\r\ndamage in the West Indies, and it was found necessary to appoint a\r\nconvoy for the Irish linen trade with England—a precaution we had never\r\nbeen compelled to adopt in the Seven Years’ War. It was calculated in\r\nFebruary 1778 that the insurgent corsairs had then taken 739 British\r\nships. Of these, 174 had been released or recaptured, but the net loss\r\nwas £2,600,000.\r\n\r\nCounter captures of American ships engaged on the coast and West\r\nIndia trade were made to about equal numbers, but the loss and the\r\nretaliation were alike injurious to the commerce of the empire. The\r\nnumber of American privateers known to exist was 173, carrying 2556\r\nguns and about 14,000 men. We had captured 34, but they were promptly\r\nreplaced, and were reinforced by Frenchmen who fitted out their ships\r\nalmost without disguise in French ports.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th March 1778, the Marquis de Noailles, then French Ambassador\r\nin London, made the momentous but not unforeseen announcement, that\r\nhis master had signed a treaty of commerce and friendship with the\r\nUnited States, which he considered as already in possession of their\r\nindependence. He added the ironical diplomatic expression of a hope\r\nthat this alliance with the king’s American rebels, as our ministers\r\nwere bound to consider them, would not disturb the friendly relations\r\nbetween the countries; but both sides knew that war was come. If the\r\nfighting did not begin immediately, the explanation of the delay is\r\nsimply that M. de Sartine had not yet been able to bring the French\r\nNavy into thorough order, while King George’s ministers were, if I may\r\nuse an expression which some of their successors have not scrupled to\r\napply to themselves with a strange inverted pride, “muddling through.”\r\n\r\nHad the house of Bourbon which ruled in France and Spain, and was\r\nresolved to abate the power of England, been in a position to adopt the\r\nmost effectual method of attack, it would have thrown an overwhelming\r\nforce into the Channel at once, thereby paralysing us all the world\r\nover. But King Louis XVI. was hardly ready, and Spain, according to\r\nher custom, was not ready at all. King Charles III. maintained a show\r\nof neutrality till the following year, and was allowed to do so by the\r\nBritish Government, which continued till the last moment to profess the\r\nbelief that he would not intervene. Had Lord North and his colleagues\r\nbeen ready to meet a danger foreseen by everybody else, one British\r\nfleet would have been promptly off Brest, while another would have been\r\ndetached to the Mediterranean to blockade Toulon. Neither side having\r\nits squadrons fit for immediate use, there was an interval of pause.\r\nOne French fleet was prepared at Brest under the Comte D’Orvilliers,\r\na very old officer who had commanded the training squadron during\r\npeace, and had in that position proved himself a good instructor and\r\na shrewd judge of character. Its purpose was to menace us at home,\r\nand so limit the force which could be detached to America. Our answer\r\nwas the formation of the Western Squadron. The command was given to\r\nKeppel under pressure of public opinion. This admiral was then the\r\nmost distinguished survivor of the leaders of the Seven Years’ War.\r\nLord Hawke, Boscawen, Pocock, and Saunders were dead or in retirement.\r\nRodney, who was as yet comparatively unknown, had ruined himself by\r\ngambling and electioneering, and had taken refuge from his creditors in\r\nParis, where he had accumulated a new load of debt. The character and\r\nposition of Keppel had an important influence on the early stages of\r\nthe war. He was by family connection a strong Whig. Burke, who loved\r\nhim, has recorded in the “Letter to a Noble Lord,” that “though it was\r\nnever shown in insult to any human being, Lord Keppel had something\r\nhigh. It was a wild stock of pride on which the tenderest of all hearts\r\nhad grafted the milder virtues.”\r\n\r\nFrom early in 1777 Sartine had begun to prepare a squadron at Toulon.\r\nIt was got ready with difficulty, for the Treasury was always in\r\nstraits, and the _classes_ then, as ever, worked ill. The purpose it\r\nwas to serve was to carry help to the Americans. The command was given\r\nto the Comte d’Estaign, a great noble of the Rouergue, now known as\r\nthe department of Rodez. D’Estaign had been bred a soldier, had served\r\nin the East Indies, and had held a governorship in the West Indies. He\r\nwas accused by us of having shown sharp practice when a prisoner of\r\nwar to the East India Company. His bold, undertaking disposition had\r\ninduced his sovereign to impose him on the corps of naval officers,\r\nwhich was discredited by the failures of La Clue and Conflans in\r\n1759, and the timidity of D’Aché. That he was our ostentatious enemy\r\nwas another strong recommendation. From his conduct in command we\r\nmay gather that his daring was born of a heat of the blood, and\r\nnot of a settled resolution of mind. He was therefore subject to\r\nfits of depression under the weight of responsibility. D’Estaign,\r\nwhose destination was well known, was allowed to sail unmolested.\r\nReinforcements were sent to Howe under the command of Admiral Byron.\r\nByron, the grandfather of the poet, had all the knightly virtues of\r\nhis brilliant cavalier house. He had sailed with Anson, had shared\r\nthe wreck of the =Wager= to the south of Chiloe, had recorded his\r\nadventures of starvation among savages, or in friendship and love among\r\nthe Spaniards of Chili, in a fine narrative, and had been the commander\r\nof a voyage of circumnavigation singularly barren of discovery. He was\r\na brave, steady officer, but without original faculty for the higher\r\nparts of war, and so persistently unfortunate in meeting storms that\r\nthe sailors had nicknamed him “Foul Weather Jack.”\r\n\r\nThe first movement was made by D’Estaign, who left Toulon on the 13th\r\nApril with a squadron of twelve sail of the line and four frigates.\r\nBaffling winds, the unskilfulness of his crews which contained few\r\nseamen, and the bad sailing qualities of some of his ships delayed his\r\nprogress, and it was not till the 15th May that he was able to clear\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar. The series of operations which opened with\r\nhis appearance off the Delaware on the 9th July was long, and ranged\r\nfrom New England to the southern limit of the West Indies. While it\r\nwas beginning, the main fleets of England and France were coming to\r\nbattle in the Channel. It will tend to make a narrative which runs\r\nthe danger of being confused from the number of contemporary events\r\nsomewhat clearer if we turn to the first meeting between Keppel and\r\nD’Orvilliers, noting only that Byron left Plymouth with thirteen\r\nsail of the line and a frigate on the 9th June to reinforce Howe, and\r\ntherefore race D’Estaign across the Atlantic in a parallel and more\r\nnortherly course. How he lost the race we shall see.\r\n\r\nAmid delays and the wrangling of opposition with ministerial orators,\r\nthe grand home fleet, or Western Squadron, was slowly made ready. On\r\nthe 12th June, Keppel sailed from Plymouth with twenty sail of the\r\nline, and was joined later by two more. When on his way to his station\r\noff Brest, and at a distance of some twenty miles to the west of the\r\nLizard, he met the French frigates _Belle Poule_ and _Licorne_. There\r\nwas as yet no formal declaration of war, but the absence of this mere\r\nceremony only served to give an air of irregularity to his actions.\r\nThe French frigates were ordered to come under the admiral’s lee. The\r\n_Licorne_ being overtaken by the =Hector= 74, obeyed, but not without\r\nfiring a broadside as she hauled her flag down—a mean demonstration\r\nvery much on a level with our exercise of the rights of war while we\r\ndenied that war as yet existed. The _Belle Poule_ was summoned by\r\nthe frigate =Arethusa=, a vessel of equal strength. Her captain, La\r\nClochetterie, naturally refused to obey an order which Captain Samuel\r\nMarshal of the =Arethusa= had no right to give. A smart action ensued.\r\nThe =Arethusa= rigging was cut to pieces, and the _Belle Poule_ made\r\noff on the approach of fresh British ships.\r\n\r\nKeppel returned to St. Helens on the 27th June, having learnt that the\r\nFrench fleet at Brest was stronger than his own. On the 9th July, the\r\nvery day by the calendar on which D’Estaign was seen off the Delaware,\r\nhe again went to sea with thirty sail of the line and six frigates.\r\nHis second in command was Sir Robert Harland, and his third was Sir\r\nHugh Palliser, the member of Sandwich’s Board of Admiralty who has been\r\nalready named. D’Orvilliers had left Brest on the previous day with\r\nthirty-two sail of the line and fourteen frigates. He was endowed with\r\nlarge powers to punish or reward, and carried energetic instructions\r\nfrom Sartine to repair the misfortunes and errors of the past. The\r\nminister gave him clearly to understand that the king might pardon his\r\nofficers for being beaten, but not for failing to fight hard.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd July the fleets sighted one another 90 miles W.N.W. of\r\nUshant in a westerly wind. We were between the enemy and the land,\r\nand therefore to leeward. The French admiral did not avail himself\r\nof his windward position to force on a battle, but followed the\r\ncautious tradition of his service and kept aloof. Four days of thick\r\nunsettled weather followed, hiding the opponents from one another. In\r\nthis interval two of D’Orvilliers’ ships, the _Bourgoyne_, 80, and\r\nthe _Alexandre_, 64, had separated and returned to Brest. Thus he was\r\nreduced to equality of numbers with Keppel, and to real inferiority\r\nof force, for one of his ships was of only 56 guns—a tolerably sharp\r\nwarning of what may happen to officers who miss opportunities. At 9\r\na.m. on the 27th the French were seen eight miles to the W.S.W. with\r\nthe wind at S.W. They were on the port tack, and heading to seaward.\r\nKeppel at once pressed in chase, while D’Orvilliers brought his fleet\r\nround to the starboard tack, and continued to hold his wind as if\r\nwishing to avoid battle. It was Keppel’s object to bring one on, and he\r\nheaded for the rear of the French line. His own rear showed the usual\r\ntendency of a long line to straggle, and signals were made to Palliser,\r\nwho commanded, to urge him on. Shortly after ten we were coming close\r\non the rear of the French. A squall of both mist and rain swept over\r\nboth fleets, hiding them from one another. When it cleared, the French\r\nadmiral was seen to have turned his fleet again, and was heading to\r\nthe west, still to windward, but so close that he would pass within\r\ncannon shot on the opposite tack. To Keppel this was a disappointment,\r\nfor he actually avowed his belief that if the Frenchman meant to fight\r\nseriously he would have remained where he was. In other words he was of\r\nopinion that D’Orvilliers ought, as a man of honour, to have allowed\r\nhis rearguard ships to be overtaken one after another, and crushed by\r\nthe fire of the English as they came up in succession. By taking this\r\nabsurdity for granted, Keppel gave the measure of his own intelligence\r\nas an admiral, and of his inferiority to D’Orvilliers as a manœuvrer.\r\n\r\nThe much debated battle of Ushant was in fact little more than a feeble\r\nparade. The fleets were going at the rate of five miles an hour, or at\r\na combined speed of ten miles; allowing 150 feet for the average length\r\nof a ship this meant that each individual vessel would be abreast of\r\nthe passing enemy for about a minute. A little more than an hour was\r\nemployed by the whole of the two forces in sweeping alongside from end\r\nto end. During this brief period of cannonading, made up as it was\r\nof much briefer flashes of combat between their component parts, the\r\nFrench gunners did more execution than ours. They pierced some of our\r\nships on the water line where they were exposed as they lay over to\r\nleeward, and seriously crippled the rigging of many of them. As the\r\ntwo lines began to pass clear, D’Orvilliers ordered his van, nominally\r\ncommanded by the Duc de Chartres afterwards known to infamy as Philippe\r\nEgalité, to turn and engage Keppel’s rear division on the lee side,\r\nmeaning to turn his centre and rear at the same time, thus putting Sir\r\nHugh Palliser between two fires. But he was ill obeyed by the Duc de\r\nChartres, whom common fame accused of cowardice, and finding that his\r\nplan could not be executed, he ran down to leeward and formed his fleet\r\non the starboard tack heading to the east, and in the same direction as\r\nours. Keppel had wished to turn his fleet also, but many of his ships\r\nwere severely crippled in hull and rigging, and the order could not be\r\nexecuted. One of the most injured was the =Formidable=, 90, flagship\r\nof Sir Hugh Palliser. We therefore remained on the same tack. With\r\nboth heading in the same direction, and we to windward, an opportunity\r\nmight appear to have offered itself for our favourite manœuvre of\r\nbearing down, and engaging from end to end. But in the course of these\r\ntwistings and turnings, the van and centre, which were less injured\r\nthan the rear, had gone further to leeward and were nearer the French.\r\nPalliser found the =Formidable= unmanageable, and his division remained\r\nabout him. Thus Keppel could not get his whole force together, and\r\nwould not attack with a part. When night fell D’Orvilliers left two\r\nquick sailing vessels to show a light in order to produce the erroneous\r\nimpression that he was still there, and steered for Brest where he\r\nanchored on the 29th. Keppel, concluding on reflection that he had many\r\nships injured, that the enemy was better able to repair damage than\r\nhe was, and that Brest was a dangerous lee shore, decided to return\r\nhome, and anchored in Plymouth on the 31st July. On the 23rd August\r\nhe was at sea once more, and on the 28th October back at Spithead.\r\nD’Orvilliers came out on the 18th August and was home again at Brest on\r\n30th September. Our fleet took several French prizes, but there was no\r\nmeeting, while our trade was fortunate in escaping French cruisers. And\r\nthis was the summer campaign of 1778 in home waters.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to say nothing of the shameful service and national\r\nquarrel which arose out of this poor battle, but it is too full of\r\nwarning, and had too much influence on the history of the coming years\r\nto be passed over. We know from a letter of Samuel Hood, who was then\r\nCommissioner of Portsmouth dockyard, that as early as the 4th of August\r\nit was common knowledge that the chiefs of the fleet were on bad terms.\r\nKeppel, in his public letter, had praised both Harland and Palliser,\r\nbut in truth he was fiercely angry with the second, whom he accused\r\nin his heart of having deliberately prevented the action of the 27th\r\nfrom becoming a real victory. It is obvious from his recorded words\r\nand his whole tone, that he believed Sir Hugh Palliser had acted as\r\nthe agent of Sandwich in the execution of a conspiracy for his ruin.\r\nThe solitary dignity of his quarterdeck left him unchecked to brood\r\nover this imagination till he was in the state of mind of some unhappy\r\nvictim of the mania of persecution. I fear we must add that there were\r\nsycophants under his command who fed his delusions. We still possess a\r\ntoadying acrid letter from no less a man than John Jervis, then captain\r\nof the =Foudroyant=, and at all times a strong Whig, which shows him\r\nbusy in the mean work of making bate. Being answered according to his\r\nfolly, Keppel grew so wise in his conceit that he reached the point\r\nwhere he became convinced that there was a plot to cause the overthrow\r\nof the British fleet, in order to discredit such an eminent Whig as\r\nhimself, that Sandwich was the author, and Palliser the agent thereof.\r\nIt was not sane, and it was the kind of insanity to which only a dull\r\nintelligence would have been liable when exasperated by soured vanity.\r\nBut “the spirit of faction” was so rampant in England at the time, and\r\nhad so thoroughly aroused one of the worst faults of our character, a\r\ntendency to loud-mouthed and contentious hectoring, that he did not\r\nwant kindred spirits to fool him to the top of his bent.\r\n\r\nThe press, animated as it was by the malignant spirit of Junius, whose\r\nvoice had only just fallen silent, took up the tale. Whigs bragged\r\nthat their admiral had saved the state from the ministerial treason\r\nof Sandwich. Ministerial papers replied that their vice-admiral had\r\nbaffled the Whig traitor. Charge and counter-charge came thick and grew\r\nmore specific. On the 15th October the _Morning Intelligencer_ made\r\na poisonous attack on Palliser, fortified by details which must have\r\ncome from Keppel’s partisans, and would not have been given without\r\nhis approval. Sir Hugh, being hot-headed, by no means a clever man,\r\nand probably ill advised, called upon Keppel for a contradiction. He\r\nought to have been silent or to have sued the paper for libel, and\r\nto have produced his admiral in the witness box. Keppel, who shirked\r\ntaking responsibility all through, would not write an answer. In an\r\ninterview he took a high and mighty tone, and spoke of the dignity of\r\ndespising the press. Sir Hugh, again most foolishly, made a public\r\nanswer to _The Intelligencer_, and allowed himself to be entangled in a\r\ncontroversy with “the bronzed and naked gentlemen of the press.” Both\r\nmen were members of Parliament, and they met in the debate of the 2nd\r\nDecember. Palliser spoke to vindicate himself, Keppel to injure his\r\nsubordinate. He got over the question why he praised Sir Hugh in his\r\npublic letter, by saying that he meant only to refer to his personal\r\ncourage, which was undoubted, and that this was the most important\r\nquality of an officer. If we could suppose that he meant what he\r\nsaid, these words might again be quoted as giving the measure of his\r\nintelligence. But his excuse was a subterfuge. For the rest he would\r\nsay nothing definite. He would sneer. He would insinuate. He would give\r\nto be understood. He would do anything except show candour. He wished\r\nSir Hugh to be condemned for gross misconduct, and while forwarding\r\nthe condemnation with cunning, he wished to maintain a fine attitude\r\nof magnanimity and of regard for the king’s service, thus escaping the\r\ninconvenience of having to prove his charges at a court martial.\r\n\r\nTo suppose that Sandwich wished to produce his own utter ruin by\r\ncausing the defeat of the Western Squadron, would be to put ourselves\r\non the moral and intellectual level of Keppel, his sycophants in\r\nthe fleet, and his friends of the opposition. But the First Lord was\r\nas pure an intriguer as many of them. There can be little doubt that\r\nhe encouraged, and none that he allowed, Palliser to bring his chief\r\nto a court martial on charges of mismanagement of the fleet in the\r\nbattle. Keppel had shown the poorest commonplace of the dull tactics\r\nof the time, but he had been orthodox in a brainless way. The hope,\r\nno doubt, was that public opinion would be turned against the Whig.\r\nThe exact contrary result followed. First a body of admirals headed by\r\nthe veteran Lord Hawke, now nearly at the end of his honourable life,\r\nprotested against the decision of the Admiralty to allow an inferior to\r\naccuse a superior. It is a necessary consequence of the respect which\r\nall disciplined men have for authority, that the higher ranks must\r\nalways be protected from being proved to be in the wrong by the lower,\r\nlest the indispensable spirit of subordination should suffer. That the\r\nchief is in error is to be deplored, but not demonstrated. Then the far\r\nfrom ignoble sympathy of the mass of Englishmen for a supposed victim\r\nwas aroused on behalf of Keppel. His court martial, which lasted from\r\nthe 7th January to the 11th February 1779, ended inevitably in his\r\nacquittal. His friends made much of his sufferings from persecution,\r\nbut they were allowed to make his poor health the excuse for a private\r\nbill to exempt him from the necessity of being tried on the flagship in\r\nPortsmouth. His triumph took place in the more comfortable surroundings\r\nof the governor’s house. The London mob, always ready for riot in\r\nthe 18th century, celebrated the finding of the Court by rabbling\r\nthe houses of Palliser and Lord North, and burning the gates of the\r\nAdmiralty in Whitehall, under the leadership of the Duke of Ancaster\r\nand, as it is said, of the youthful William Pitt.\r\n\r\nPalliser resigned and demanded a court martial. Though Keppel still\r\nrefused to appear as accuser, the trial was held on the flagship\r\nbetween the 12th April and 3rd May. It ended in an acquittal with the\r\nqualification that Palliser ought to have made the admiral acquainted\r\nwith the condition of the =Formidable=. Sir Hugh retired to the\r\nGovernorship of Greenwich Hospital. Keppel was so popular that the\r\nAdmiralty did not dare to remove him. But he was now in love with his\r\nparts of martyr and factious politician. He began to wrangle over\r\norders, and to find offence where none was. At last he was allowed to\r\nhaul down his flag at his own request. In his place in Parliament he\r\nwas not ashamed to sneer at a brother officer, who, in the course of\r\n1779, had to retire up Channel in face of an enemy twice his strength,\r\nand to insinuate that he himself would have been bolder in such a\r\npass than he was with the equal fleet of D’Orvilliers, and the coast\r\nof Brest under his lee in July 1778. For a time he, with the help\r\nunhappily of Howe, an incomparably better man, set the disgraceful\r\nexample of refusing to serve because what they were pleased to call\r\ntheir honour was not safe with Sandwich. His tar barrel popularity\r\nwas clamorous for a space, and he succeeded Vernon on many tavern\r\nsignboards, but by 1783 Rodney and Hood had arisen, and the patriot\r\nhero of 1779 had become the “Cautious Leeshore.”\r\n\r\nWhile the battle of Ushant was being half fought, and the subsequent\r\nquarrel was dragging its slow length along, a brilliant campaign\r\nwas being conducted on the coasts of America. D’Estaign, it will be\r\nremembered, had cleared the Straits of Gibraltar on the 16th May. His\r\nsquadron consisted of the _Languedoc_, 80 (Flagship), _Tonnant_, 80,\r\n_César_, 74, _Zélé_, 74, _Hector_, 74, _Marseilles_, 74, _Protecteur_,\r\n74, _Guerrier_, 74, _Vaillant_, 64, _Provence_, 64, _Fantasque_, 64,\r\nand _Sagittaire_, 64, with the frigates _Chimère_, _Engageante_,\r\n_Alcmène_ and _Aimable_. Some of them were bad sailers, and as the\r\ncrews had been completed by drafting soldiers, they were awkward. The\r\nneglect of the past weighed on the French fleet, and the nerve of the\r\nAdmiral. D’Estaign spent much time in practising his raw crews, a wise\r\nprecaution no doubt, but one which was fatal to rapidity of movement.\r\nHe added gratuitously to the causes of delay by turning aside to chase\r\nprizes. On the 8th July he reached the Delaware, and landed M. Gérard\r\nde Rayneval, the French Minister to Congress, whom he had brought with\r\nhim. Even then he would not make haste to begin his attack on the\r\nBritish squadron. On his way north to New York, and on the 10th July,\r\nhe actually lost sight of his fleet because he employed his mighty\r\nflagship, the _Languedoc_, in chasing a trumpery British vessel named\r\nthe =York=, of 10 guns and 60 men. These were not the methods to\r\nemploy against the wary, resolute, and thorough antagonist he was about\r\nto encounter.\r\n\r\nHowe had been informed early in May of the coming intervention of\r\nFrance. Her entry on the scene made it absolutely necessary to withdraw\r\nour troops from Philadelphia and concentrate at New York. Of the total\r\nforce of eleven ships of the line and sixty-eight smaller craft under\r\nthe admiral’s command, some were at our naval port Halifax, others\r\nwere at New York, and others in Rhode Island, then held by a body of\r\nBritish troops under General Pigott. Howe called all the ships which\r\ncould be spared from local duties to his flag, and set about covering\r\nthe retreat of the army now led by Sir Henry Clinton. Transport to\r\nconvey the troops by sea were wanting, and it was also thought to be\r\nthe more dignified course to march through the Jerseys. On the 18th\r\nJune the army had crossed the Delaware under cover of the squadron,\r\nand made its way to Navesink, harassed, but not seriously impeded by\r\nWashington. Howe reached Sandy Hook on the 29th June, and waited to\r\ncover the entry of Clinton into New York. Here he was informed of the\r\nsailing of D’Estaign, and of the reinforcements destined for himself,\r\nwhich had left Plymouth under Byron so late as the 9th June. On the\r\n30th June Clinton’s army appeared on the heights and was passed over to\r\nNew York by the 5th July. Barely was the passage concluded when Captain\r\nGardner, of the =Maidstone= frigate, sent a lieutenant with the news\r\nthat D’Estaign had been seen to enter the Delaware. On the 11th July\r\nthe =Zebra= sloop ran in with the news that the Frenchman was close at\r\nhand. If D’Estaign had taken less than nearly two months to make the\r\nrun from Toulon, the concentration of our forces at New York would have\r\nbeen defeated, for Howe was far too weak to give battle, and must have\r\nbeen shut up in the Delaware.\r\n\r\nThe force actually with Howe consisted of six 64-gun ships, three\r\nof 50, two of 40, frigates, and small vessels. The 40-gun ships\r\nbeing wholly unfit to lie in a line of battle, Howe was practically\r\noutnumbered in the proportion of two to one by the fine squadron of\r\nD’Estaign. Outnumbered as he was, he had no resource but to stand on\r\nthe defensive, and the anchorage at Sandy Hook happily afforded him\r\nan admirable position. Sandy Hook had once been a peninsula, but\r\nthe sea having broken through the narrow isthmus connecting it with\r\nNavesink, it was already an island running due north and south, and\r\nso forming a natural mole to the anchorage. Outside it is the Middle\r\nBank, and to the north is the East Bank. There are two entries from\r\nthe sea to the roadstead—one between the Middle Bank and Sandy Hook,\r\nwhich is too shallow for big ships at the northern end, and the other\r\nbetween the Middle Bank and East Bank, which is rendered uncertain by\r\na bar. Batteries were thrown up at the north end of Sandy Hook. The\r\nsquadron was then anchored in a line from the extremity of Sandy Hook\r\nto the west, in this order. The =Leviathan=, a store ship turned into a\r\nfloating battery, =Ardent=, =Nonsuch=, =Trident=, =Somerset=, =Eagle=\r\n(Flagship), and =Isis=. Frigates were brought inside to the south,\r\nwhile the =Vigilant=, =Phœnix=, and =Preston= were posted behind the\r\nbar between the Middle and East Banks. Fireships and gunboats were\r\nplaced where they could threaten the flank of the French fleet if it\r\ncrossed the bar. The ships in the line were anchored with a spring on\r\nthe cable—that is, with a cable carried out from the stern and fastened\r\nto the cable of the anchor so that their broadsides could be worked\r\nround to bear on an approaching enemy. If then D’Estaign attacked,\r\nevery means possible had been provided to crush his ships in detail as\r\nthey cleared the Middle Bank, and came under the fire of the batteries\r\nat the extremity of Sandy Hook and of Howe’s line. Our squadron was\r\nshort-handed, but the deficiency was promptly made good by the eager\r\nzeal of the sailors in the merchant ships and transports. Though they\r\nhabitually avoided the press when they could, there was no hanging\r\nback at this crisis, and the volunteers outnumbered the call made by\r\nthe admiral. As many of them must have served at one time or another,\r\nand all were “sailormen” able to set up rigging and splice ropes, they\r\nwere not mere raw recruits. The officers and men of Clinton’s army came\r\nforward readily to serve as marines.\r\n\r\nThe hazard before D’Estaign was not trifling. Yet had he attacked\r\nat once when he appeared off Sandy Hook on the 12th July, he would\r\nhave found Howe’s dispositions still incomplete. Even later he ought\r\nbeyond all question to have stood in. The total destruction of Howe’s\r\nsquadron would have given so severe a blow to the material strength\r\nand the prestige of England that it would have been cheaply purchased\r\nby the sacrifice of half D’Estaign’s ships. So would have reasoned his\r\nsubordinate the captain of the _Fantasque_, Suffren. But again the past\r\nweighed on the unstable mind of D’Estaign. He anchored four miles from\r\nSandy Hook, off Shrewsbury, and remained till the 21st examining the\r\nbar, and communicating with the Americans. The risk of grounding on\r\nthe bar seemed too great to him to be run, and in all probability he\r\nasked himself, what would happen if the British reinforcements arrived\r\nand found him amid the wreck of Howe’s ships with a crippled squadron?\r\nOn the 22nd he made a show of falling on, and then sailed away to the\r\nsouth. A small convoy fell into his hands, and he had the satisfaction\r\nof blockading a British port for ten days.\r\n\r\nHowe at once dispatched frigates to watch the enemy. Observation and\r\nrumour led him to believe, rightly, that D’Estaign meant to proceed\r\nto co-operate with an American force in an attack on Sir R. Pigott\r\non Rhode Island. But for some days he was too weak to move. On the\r\n26th July the =Renown=, 50, joined him from the West Indies. She had\r\npassed through the French squadron on her way, unmolested and perhaps\r\nunobserved. Misled by bad information from home, Howe had been under\r\nthe impression that Byron was bound for Halifax. He had sent thither\r\nfor news, and on the 26th his messenger returned with the report\r\nthat nothing was known there of the reinforcements, but that the\r\nCommissioner, Captain Fielding, was sending on the =Raisonable=, 64,\r\nand =Centurion=, 50, which had refitted. They joined the flag at Sandy\r\nHook safely. On the 30th July the =Cornwall=, 74, came in from Byron’s\r\nsquadron with a depressing story.\r\n\r\nThe admiral had met his accustomed fortune in weather when he was least\r\nable to contend with his implacable enemy. He had left Plymouth on\r\nthe 9th June with one 90-gun ship, eleven 74, one of 64, and a single\r\nfrigate. If numbers were all in war, while speed and efficiency were\r\nlittle, his squadron had been more than enough to sweep D’Estaign\r\nfrom the coast of America. But Byron sailed late, and his ships were\r\nill provided in all ways. The crews had been made up by drafts\r\nof prisoners who brought the jail fever with them. So bad was the\r\ncondition of the fleet that it was unable to contend with a summer\r\nstorm which broke on it in the middle of the North Atlantic on the 3rd\r\nJuly. Some of the ships returned home, and all were scattered. Byron\r\nhimself struggled on alone toward Sandy Hook till the 18th August, when\r\nhe sighted the French fleet, and turned back to Halifax, where he found\r\none only of his command. Except the =Cornwall=, none reached Howe’s\r\nflag in time to be of service. Those which limped in later, and by\r\ndegrees, were crippled in rigging, and foul with putrid fevers.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th July, the day before the =Cornwall= joined his flag, Howe\r\nheard that D’Estaign had been sighted off Rhode Island, to the east\r\nof New York. The object of the Frenchman was manifestly to co-operate\r\nwith the insurgents in attacking the British force then occupying the\r\nisland, under the command of General Pigott. Howe was the last man in\r\nthe world to be deterred by mere inferiority of numbers from exerting\r\nhimself in the king’s service, and outmatched as he still was, he\r\nprepared to support General Pigott. Contrary winds detained him at New\r\nYork till the 6th August. On the 9th he was off the southern end of\r\nRhode Island. Rhode Island is one of several which nearly block up a\r\ngreat oblong bay opening to the south in the coast, which here runs\r\nnearly due east and west. It is separated from the mainland on the east\r\nby the Sakonnet Channel, and from the island of Conanicut on the west,\r\nby the Eastern Passage. The Western Passage divides Conanicut from the\r\nmainland, and leads to the land-locked waters of Narragansett Bay. The\r\ntown of Newport stands nearly at the south-western end of Rhode Island,\r\nand here General Pigott had concentrated his troops when the American\r\ngeneral, Sullivan, passed over from the mainland to attack him.\r\nD’Estaign had anchored within Brenton’s Ledge, at the south-western\r\npoint of Rhode Island, on the 29th July. He sent two frigates up the\r\nSakonnet Channel and two liners up the Western Passage to Narragansett\r\nBay, and then entered the Eastern Passage on the 8th August, anchoring\r\nabove the town of Newport, at Goat Island, between Conanicut and Rhode\r\nIsland. His appearance in overwhelming strength sufficed to gain him a\r\nnaval success without fighting. A small British flotilla, consisting\r\nof the frigates and sloops =Orpheus=, =Lark=, =Juno=, =Flora=, and\r\n=Falcon=, was caught at hopeless disadvantage, and was burnt by the\r\ncommanding officer, Captain Brisbane, to prevent it from falling into\r\nthe hands of the French. The crews were added to the garrison of\r\nNewport.\r\n\r\nHowe was off Brenton Point on the 9th. He had a difficult game to play,\r\nfor he was still inferior to his opponent by a third, and he had to\r\ntake the offensive. Everything depended on precision of movement, and\r\nthe British admiral transferred his flag to a frigate in order that\r\nhe might keep his whole squadron always under his eye. The question\r\nwhether the proper place for an admiral was in the midst of a battle\r\nor outside of it was argued in the eighteenth century, and has been\r\ndebated since. It really resolves itself into the other question,\r\nwhether the admiral is best employed in setting an example or in\r\ndirecting the operations of which he must needs lose sight from the\r\nmoment that his flagship is involved in the fire and smoke of battle.\r\nTradition and the point of honour dictated the first course. Sound\r\njudgment agrees with them—whenever the example is of more moment than\r\nthe direction. But there are times when it is not, and the early days\r\nof August 1778 off Rhode Island was one of them. Yet only an officer of\r\nHowe’s established reputation for cool intrepidity could have afforded\r\nto break away from old usage, and it is said that he was so far\r\nimpressed by the fear of being thought shy that he intended to return\r\nto his flagship if a battle had to be fought.\r\n\r\nD’Estaign credited his opponent with more energy than he had himself\r\nshown at Long Island. He was seriously afraid of being attacked by\r\nfireships at anchor—and indeed they had been prepared, and would have\r\nbeen used. When, therefore, the wind shifted from south to north-east\r\non the morning of the 10th, he came at once to sea, cannonading\r\nPigott’s batteries at Newport as he passed, and calling in the two\r\nliners sent to Narragansett Bay. Though he had numbers and the wind\r\nin his favour, he made no attempt to force on a battle, and manœuvred\r\nto keep the weather-gage. Howe strove to win it, intending to fall on\r\nthe Frenchman and to use his fireships. He succeeded, but a furious\r\ngale scattered both fleets on the 11th, and they were not rallied\r\ntill the 17th. In the interval, the French had suffered more from the\r\nstorm than our ships. Three of them, the _Languedoc_, _Marseilles_, and\r\n_César_, were attacked while crippled by the =Renown=, =Preston=, and\r\n=Isis=, smaller vessels, but under complete command. None of them were\r\ntaken, thanks to the timely arrival of help. Howe reunited his squadron\r\nat Sandy Hook, and then returned to Rhode Island on hearing that the\r\nFrenchman had reappeared. But D’Estaign had lost all confidence, and\r\nwas oppressed by a sense of the need for stores and repairs. He sailed\r\naway to Boston. Sullivan withdrew from Rhode Island, exploding against\r\nhis ally in terms of rude and taunting reproach. Howe found the French\r\ntoo strongly posted in Boston to be assailed, and after reconnoitring\r\ntheir position on the 30th, returned to New York. Byron’s scattered\r\nships now began to drop in, but Howe’s service was over for the time\r\nbeing. On the 25th September he handed over his command to Gambier, and\r\nsailed for home. On his return he refused to serve under Sandwich, who\r\nhad supported him so ill. The reason was a bad one, and was not excused\r\nby the fact that the minister’s hacks endeavoured to throw blame on the\r\nadmiral. An officer who pleads a personal offence as an excuse for not\r\nfighting his country’s enemies sets an example which is only just short\r\nof mutinous.\r\n\r\nGambier was soon superseded by the arrival of his superior Byron.\r\n“Foul Weather Jack” made haste to refit his ships at New York, and on\r\nthe 18th October went to look into Boston. Storms blew him about, he\r\nlost vessels, and was forced to take refuge in Newport, Rhode Island.\r\nD’Estaign in the meantime had been striving with the ill-will of the\r\nBostonians, a people described by the English historian Beatson as of\r\n“a sour, morose, and sullen temper.” They were very angry with the\r\nFrench for not giving more support to Sullivan at Rhode Island, and\r\nshowed their ill-will by making riotous attacks on the sailors of their\r\nallies. One of D’Estaign’s officers, M. de Saint Sauveur, was actually\r\nkilled in a savage conflict between the townsmen and the French boats’\r\ncrews. The admiral was nevertheless able to refit his squadron mainly\r\nwith our own naval stores, captured and brought into port by the active\r\nAmerican privateers. The approach of winter made campaigning hazardous\r\non the stormy Northern coast, and on the 4th November D’Estaign sailed\r\nfor the West Indies, where the French wished to recover their losses in\r\nthe previous war. All through this war the main fleets will be found\r\nleaving the Antilles when the hurricane months begin in July, and the\r\nsummer favours them in the North. Then, as winter approaches, and the\r\nhurricane season is over in October, they will be found streaming\r\nback to take part in the defence or conquest of the islands round the\r\nCaribbean Sea. The change in the scene of conflict had been foreseen\r\nby us. On the 4th November, the very day that D’Estaign left Boston,\r\nHotham sailed from New York with two 64-gun ships, three of 50, and\r\nthree frigates, carrying 5000 men of the army in North America, which\r\nwas already too weak for its work. They were destined for Barbadoes\r\nfirst, and then for the general protection of the Sugar Islands. So\r\nclose did Hotham and D’Estaign come to one another on the passage\r\nthat a Newfoundland dog belonging to an English officer, which fell\r\noverboard, is said to have been picked up swimming by the French\r\nflagship the _Languedoc_, but there was no meeting.\r\n\r\nThough to follow the cruise of D’Estaign and Byron to its close will\r\ncompel us to overlap contemporary operations elsewhere, an even\r\ngreater degree of confusion would be created by making an arbitrary\r\nbreak in the narrative of one continuous series of movements. Yet it\r\nis necessary to go back for a brief space to explain what the rival\r\nadmirals found waiting for them, when they came escaping from the\r\nsnowstorms and icy cold of the North to the unfailing easterly trade\r\nwinds, the baffling land breezes, the sun, and the purple seas of the\r\nWest Indies.\r\n\r\nThe French possessions in those waters consisted of part of San\r\nDomingo, of Guadaloupe, Martinique, and Marie Galante. Dominica,\r\nbetween Martinique and Guadaloupe, was in our hands. Next to the\r\nSouth came Santa Lucia, a French island, and beyond it St. Vincent\r\nand Grenada, English possessions. The whole of the Lesser Antilles\r\nconstituted the Leeward Station, so called because they lie to leeward\r\nof Barbadoes. The reader may be reminded that as the easterly trade\r\nwind is permanent in the West Indies, and is therefore called “the true\r\nbreeze,” to leeward always means to westward, and to windward is to\r\neastward for the Creole and the seafaring man. During the early months\r\nof 1778 there had been the usual examples of breaches of the law of\r\nnations on both sides, and the consequent mutual accusations, very loud\r\nand very futile. The French had no naval force at hand except a few\r\nfrigates and sloops. Our own squadron consisted of one 74-gun ship, one\r\n70, with frigates and sloops to the number of fourteen. From the month\r\nof June onwards they were under the command of Samuel Barrington, a\r\nmember of the well-known Irish family. Barrington remained at Barbadoes\r\nwaiting to see what the French would do. In September he discovered.\r\nThe Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, collected a flotilla\r\nof frigates, sloops, and trading-craft, embarked troops and Creole\r\nvolunteers, and soused down on Dominica. It fell at once, and the\r\nhistory of its fall is highly characteristic of our management in\r\nthose days. Forts had been built and guns landed for the defence of\r\nthe island. Nothing was wanting except a garrison. There was no force\r\nin Dominica save parts of two companies of the 48th and a handful of\r\nartillerymen—not enough to hold a small fort. Having nothing else to\r\ndo, they surrendered. Barrington complained that he was misinformed as\r\nto the strength of the enemy. If he had not kept his line-of-battle\r\nships idle at Barbadoes, he could have found out for himself, and one\r\nof them cruising round Martinique would have stopped Bouillé. It was\r\nquite in keeping with this sloth and this dependence on information\r\nsupplied by governors that Barrington joined the noble band of officers\r\nwho refused to serve in responsible places under Sandwich because their\r\nhonour was not safe with him. Having allowed Dominica to go for want of\r\nsupport, he left Barbadoes in order to see after the safety of Antigua,\r\nto the north of Guadaloupe. It was our naval dockyard in the Leeward\r\nIslands. Antigua having a competent garrison was in no danger. Then\r\nhe returned to Barbadoes, and waited till he was joined on the 10th\r\nDecember by Hotham with the ships and soldiers from New York.\r\n\r\nThe combined squadrons at once proceeded to give the French a Roland\r\nfor their Oliver by seizing Santa Lucia. The French island was not much\r\nbetter prepared for defence than Dominica, and when it was attacked\r\non the 13th and 14th of December the Governor retired to one of the\r\nhills in the interior, while the coast fell into our hands. Barrington\r\nanchored in the Cul de Sac, a bay on the western side of the island\r\nopening on to the Caribbean Sea, while the troops besieged the French\r\nGovernor. Next day D’Estaign appeared with his more powerful squadron.\r\nHe had anchored at Fort Royal, in Martinique, on the 9th December, and\r\nit had been his intention to assail Barbadoes. The danger of Santa\r\nLucia compelled him to change his plans. He shipped Bouillé and his\r\ntroops, and on the 15th made his effort to rescue the island. It proved\r\nbut feeble. Barrington had placed his seven ships across the mouth of\r\nthe Cul de Sac, throwing up shore batteries to cover his flanks. If\r\nhe was wanting in foresight and enterprise, he was stout. D’Estaign\r\nbehaved as he had done at Sandy Hook, making mere shows of attack, and\r\nexcusing himself by pleading that the treacherous breezes under the\r\nland hampered his movements. They presented real difficulties, but in\r\nthe opinion of D’Estaign’s best officers he was too easily disconcerted\r\nby such obstacles. Bouillé landed with his troops, but failed to shake\r\nthe hold of the British troops on their positions. Then D’Estaign heard\r\nby a privateer that Byron was on his way from North America. Instead of\r\njudging as his countryman Mahé de la Bourdonnais had done at Madras,\r\nthat the approach of relief for his enemy was a reason for making an\r\ninstant and strenuous effort, he re-embarked the troops on the 28th,\r\nand next day anchored at Fort Royal in one of the fits of depression\r\nand self-pity which alternated with his outbursts of energy. M. Micoud,\r\nthe French Governor of Santa Lucia, surrendered on the 30th, he having\r\nalso nothing else to do, and the island remained with us, to serve as\r\nRodney’s headquarters in the great crisis of the war.\r\n\r\nByron had indeed left Newport in Rhode Island, on the 14th December,\r\nafter a desperate struggle with his old enemy the storms, which very\r\nnearly drove one of his liners on shore, and did considerable damage to\r\nthe spars of others. With twelve sail of the line he struggled through\r\nthe winter weather, and reached Barbadoes on the 7th January 1779. Then\r\nhe pushed on to Santa Lucia, which he made his headquarters for the\r\nwatch on D’Estaign at Fort Royal. The French admiral now outnumbered,\r\nwas cautious, and would risk nothing. He only came out to go in again.\r\nIn February Byron was reinforced by Rear-Admiral Rowley. Though this\r\nofficer was stationed to windward of Martinique, to intercept any\r\nreinforcements coming to D’Estaign, he failed. The French admiral\r\nwas successively joined by the Comte de Grasse, Rodney’s opponent on\r\na future date, from Brest, by Vaudreuil from the coast of Africa,\r\nand by La Motte Picquet from Toulon. They brought his strength up to\r\ntwenty-five sail of the line and twelve frigates, which gave him a\r\ndistinct superiority of numbers over Byron.\r\n\r\nThe next passage in the naval campaign illustrated at once some of\r\nthe burdens laid on our admirals, Byron’s poorness of judgment in\r\nthe greater operations of war, and the miserable character of the\r\nprinciples on which the French were content to act. In June the\r\nWest India convoys were collected for their return to Europe. The\r\nmeeting-place of the ships was St. Christopher, to the north-west of\r\nGuadaloupe. Commerce was so essential to England that no admiral could\r\nhave neglected to give it protection. Nor could the country, which was\r\nsuffering severely from the strain of the war, have endured the entire\r\nstoppage of the West Indian trade for the year in order to leave the\r\nfleet free—a measure occasionally taken by the military and autocratic\r\nGovernment of France. But Byron could have secured the convoy from\r\ndanger by blockading the French at Fort Royal. He did not know of the\r\narrival of La Motte Picquet, and had every reason to believe himself\r\nstill superior to D’Estaign. Even if he were not, and the Frenchman\r\ncame out to give battle, this was precisely what an English admiral\r\nought to have desired. But Byron sailed away to Saint Christopher to\r\nmother the convoy, leaving the road open to his enemy. If D’Estaign had\r\nbeen a truly bold man, and not only a gentleman of showy daring in “the\r\nimminent deadly breach,” which indeed he was, he would have sought out\r\nByron at once after the junction of La Motte Picquet’s squadron. But\r\nhe was content to dwell in the traditional French policy of avoiding\r\nbattle and grabbing at ports. Freed from Byron’s watch, he swooped on\r\nsmall game. St. Vincent was carried by an expedition of irregulars\r\nunder a bold partisan of the name of Trolong de Rumain, a lieutenant in\r\nthe French Navy. Trolong was helped by the Caribs, and even more by a\r\nquarrel then raging between the English Governor and his Council. St.\r\nVincent having been secured, D’Estaign on the 2nd July fell on Grenada\r\nwith his great fleet and Bouillé’s troops.\r\n\r\nByron having seen the convoy on its way home, returned to Santa Lucia\r\non the 1st July—to learn that St. Vincent was gone, that D’Estaign was\r\nat sea, and that some other of our possessions was menaced. He was ill\r\ninformed as to the strength of his opponent, and remained in doubt for\r\ntwo or three days as to what the Frenchman was doing. While preparing\r\nto attempt the recapture of St. Vincent, he heard of the danger of\r\nGrenada, and came down to its assistance—too late. On the 6th July a\r\nbattle was fought off the island which marks the very nadir of the\r\npompous futile tactics developed under the old Instructions. Byron\r\nhad with him twenty-one ships to his opponent’s twenty-five, and was\r\nto windward. D’Estaign, at anchor when the Englishman appeared, stood\r\nout, keeping to leeward, and waiting to be attacked. We came down in\r\na slanting line, the leading English ship steering for the leading\r\nFrenchman. Of course our van came into action unsupported, and was\r\ncut to pieces. Then D’Estaign made no attempt to push his advantage,\r\nbut whisked round, and returned to his anchorage. Byron picked up\r\nthe fragments, and seeing that Grenada was gone, sailed away to St.\r\nChristopher again. A few weeks of mere parade followed. D’Estaign made\r\nmotions as if to force on a battle, but did nothing effectual. Byron\r\nwas ready to fight again, if his opponent would provide him with a\r\nbattle. In August he left for home, handing over the command to Admiral\r\nParker. D’Estaign, after touching at San Domingo, sailed for the coast\r\nof America to join General Lincoln, in the unsuccessful attempt to\r\nretake Savannah, occupied by us during the previous autumn. The siege\r\nwas raised in October, and the French admiral left for home followed by\r\nthe growls of the discontented Americans.\r\n\r\nWhile these operations were running their course on the American coast\r\nand in the West Indies with various fortunes and no striking display\r\nof ability, in the later months, an amazing example of the essential\r\nweakness of England’s enemies was being given at home. Spain joined\r\nFrance in the summer of 1779, bringing to the aid of her allies the\r\nunwieldy bulk of her nerveless fleet. The Courts of Paris and Madrid\r\ncame to the decision to attempt an invasion under the protection of\r\ntheir united squadrons. French troops and transports were collected\r\nat Havre and St. Malo. On the 3rd June, D’Orvilliers sailed south to\r\nmeet the Spaniards with twenty-eight of the line, nine frigates, and\r\neight small vessels, and by direction of his Government stationed\r\nhimself at the Sisargas, twenty miles west of Corunna. Slothful and\r\nunready as ever, the Spaniards had not fully joined till the 26th July,\r\nand four days more were spent in settling signals and other details\r\nof business. D’Orvilliers had no confidence in the success of the\r\nlumbering armament he was called upon to direct. He thought that the\r\nsixty-six liners of which it was composed made too large a force to\r\nbe manœuvred. The Spaniards might be brave and willing, but were in\r\nhis opinion neither officers nor seamen. Don Luis de Córdoba, their\r\ncommander-in-chief, a man of seventy-five, is described as having “no\r\npersonal existence,” and as having seen no service except against the\r\nMoors. His individuality was displayed only in senile obstinacy and\r\nvanity. Provisions were ill supplied, the health of the fleet was bad\r\nand grew worse. D’Orvilliers’ heart was broken by the death of his only\r\nson, an officer in the flagship, who fell a victim to the pest. In\r\nthese miserable conditions, material, moral, and mental, the new Armada\r\nsailed from the coast of Galicia.\r\n\r\nOn one side reinforcements had been sent to North America under\r\nArbuthnot in the early months of the year, and an attack on the Channel\r\nIslands had been beaten off. Sir Charles Hardy, an old officer, was\r\ndrawn from retirement and appointed to succeed Keppel, when he and\r\nother admirals refused to serve. Hardy sailed with the grand fleet of\r\nthirty-five sail to the West on the 16th June, and remained at sea\r\ncovering the trade and watching for the enemy. With bolder management\r\nhe might easily have delivered a crushing stroke at D’Orvilliers at the\r\nSisargas during the fifty mortal days while the French were waiting\r\nfor the lagging Spaniards. D’Orvilliers and Córdoba reached as high as\r\nPlymouth on the 14th August, and their presence caused a lively panic\r\nin the country. But nothing came of it all, except the capture of the\r\n=Ardent=, 64, which fell into their hands by the bad management of her\r\ncaptain. First the allies were paralysed by calms, then the wind turned\r\neasterly on the 17th, and blew them out westward. They sighted Hardy,\r\nbut failed to bring him to action or to prevent him reaching Spithead,\r\nand by the 14th September had broken up and had turned back to their\r\nrespective homes. The four days’ command of the Channel for which\r\nNapoleon was to sigh had been theirs, but they did nothing with the\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN WAR TILL THE FALL OF YORKTOWN\r\n\r\n AUTHORITIES.—As before.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course of the war in 1780 was dictated by the political conditions.\r\nFrance, disappointed by the futile end of the great demonstration in\r\nthe Channel in 1779, did not renounce naval warfare in European waters,\r\nbut was turning her attention towards giving more effectual aid to\r\nthe Americans, and to efforts in combination with the Spaniards for\r\nthe entire expulsion of England from the West Indies. Spain watching\r\nMinorca, and blocking Gibraltar, was prepared to co-operate with France\r\nin Europe and the Antilles, while making an effort to recover Florida.\r\nDon Bernardo de Galves, sailing from Havana, did achieve success in\r\nthis minor and isolated operation. The most effectual defence for us\r\nwould have been to blockade Brest, Ferrol, Cadiz, and Toulon. But with\r\nan equality of numbers against us and the peremptory obligation to\r\ngive naval support to the army in America—the cancer which drained our\r\nstrength in all these years—the high line could not be taken. Moreover,\r\nthe rigid enforcement of our belligerent rights against neutrals at\r\nsea was steadily bringing us into collision with Holland, to the\r\nverge of a conflict with the Northern Powers, Russia, Prussia, and\r\nthe Scandinavian States, and this would have been sheer ruin; for the\r\nrevolt of the plantations had cut us off from the supply of American\r\nnaval stores, and we were dependent on the Baltic for timber, pitch,\r\nand hemp, without which our fleets could not have been fitted for sea.\r\n\r\nD’Orvilliers and Luis de Córdoba having shrunk away from the Channel in\r\nSeptember 1779, we were at liberty to set about defending our remoter\r\ninterests, the relief of Minorca and Gibraltar, and the strengthening\r\nof our naval position in the New World. Mention has been made of\r\nthe sailing of Arbuthnot in June. He had with him a convoy of 400\r\nmerchant-ships with stores for General Clinton at New York. Having\r\nturned aside to defend the Channel Islands, he sent his convoy into\r\nport to wait for him. A shift in the wind delayed his departure from\r\nthe Channel, and though he got away safe under the wing of Hardy’s\r\ngrand fleet, he did not reach New York till August. Here he took\r\nover the command from Sir John Collier, who had superseded Gambier,\r\nand he co-operated in December 1779 with Cornwallis in the taking of\r\nCharlestown, in Carolina, after the retreat of D’Estaign from before\r\nSavannah. In the West Indies Hyde Parker had a superiority of force\r\nover D’Estaign’s successors, the Comte de Grasse and La Motte Picquet,\r\nand was able to confine them to Fort Royal.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1779 measures were taken to relieve Minorca and\r\nGibraltar and to reinforce the West Indies. A great convoy was\r\ncollected to carry stores and soldiers to the Mediterranean fortresses.\r\nIt sailed under the guard of twenty-two line-of-battle ships and many\r\nfrigates. The command was given to Rodney, who after relieving the\r\nfortresses was to go on with part of the fleet to the West Indies,\r\nand there supersede Parker. With Rodney a new spirit entered into the\r\nconduct of the naval war. He was the ablest officer, except Howe,\r\nwho had yet hoisted his flag, and was indeed a man of quite another\r\nstamp from Keppel, Byron, Parker, Hardy, or Arbuthnot. In the Austrian\r\nSuccession and Seven Years’ Wars he had gained a reputation in the\r\nservice for ability and zeal, had been captain under Mathews and\r\nHawke, had commanded in the Leeward Islands, and had been bitterly\r\ndisappointed when he was superseded by Pocock during the capture of\r\nHavana. He was eager, was not satisfied with the prevailing formal\r\napplication of the Fighting Orders, and had turned his intellect to\r\nthe conduct of war. His defects were that he was no longer young,\r\nand that his health was ruined by diseases which were, at least in\r\npart, the result of early dissipation. It was his misfortune to be\r\ntoo deeply conscious of the fact that he represented an ancient\r\nfamily of Somersetshire gentry and was closely connected with the\r\nducal house of Chandos. His brother-officers appeared to him in the\r\nlight of middle-class persons of inferior breeding who lived mostly\r\nin the ports when on shore. The naval habits of the time kept the\r\ncaptain and admiral in great seclusion, since it was hardly thought\r\nconsistent with their dignity to speak with subordinates except on\r\nmatters of duty. Under the influence of pain and social arrogance,\r\nRodney carried this isolation to an extreme. He had ruined himself\r\nby gambling and bribery at elections, and had taken refuge from his\r\ncreditors in Paris when the American War began. A loan from the French\r\nMarshal Biron saved him from imprisonment as a debtor in the Bastille.\r\nOn his return to London he sought for employment, and the refusal of\r\nother admirals to serve opened the way for him to his great but tardy\r\nopportunity. The jobbery and favouritism of the age had by no means\r\nleft him untouched. During his famous command in the West Indies he\r\nmade his own son a post-captain at the age of seventeen, and he drove\r\nhis subordinate, Isaac Coffin, into flat revolt by forcing mere lads on\r\nhim as lieutenants. When he sailed for Gibraltar in December 1779, two\r\ninfluences were at work in his mind, a noble and ignoble. He burned to\r\ngain glory for himself and victory for his country by vigorous conduct\r\nof the war, and he was deeply concerned to repair his shattered fortune\r\nby prize money.\r\n\r\nRodney sailed on the 27th December 1779, taking with him both the\r\nreliefs for Minorca and Gibraltar, and a convoy of merchant-ships\r\nbound for the West Indies. The trade was seen clear of the Channel,\r\nand sent on its way on the 7th January 1780. The main fleet now went\r\non to Gibraltar with the stores and reliefs, and on the 8th, when\r\n300 miles E.N.E. of Finisterre, fell in with and captured a Spanish\r\nconvoy of one 64-gun ship, seven frigates and sloops, and fifteen\r\nmerchant-ships, bound for South America. This prosperous beginning of\r\nthe service was soon followed by a more signal success. Storms in the\r\nStraits had distressed the awkward Spanish blockading fleet, and the\r\ngreater part of it had been forced to take refuge in harbour. But a\r\nsquadron of eleven ships of the line under the command of Don Juan de\r\nLángara was stationed off Cape St. Vincent to intercept the relieving\r\nforce which the Spanish Government was convinced would not exceed ten\r\nliners. On the 16th January Rodney swept down on this inferior force,\r\nin a brisk breeze rising to a gale from the west. He steered between\r\nthem and the land as they endeavoured to escape, overtook them in the\r\nnight, and destroyed them completely. Six were taken, one of the prizes\r\nbeing Lángara’s flagship, and a seventh blew up with the loss of all\r\nhands. Two of the prizes were recaptured by their Spanish crews during\r\nthe storm following the action, but as Barceló, the Spanish admiral,\r\ndid not venture to leave the protection of the forts at Algeciras,\r\nthere was no further opposition to the relief of Gibraltar. Rodney’s\r\nsubordinate, Digby, went up the Mediterranean to Minorca with stores.\r\nOn the 14th the admiral left for the West Indies with six sail of the\r\nline, and four days later Digby, leaving four ships to aid in the\r\ndefence of the fortress, took the others, and the empty storeships,\r\nback to the Channel unopposed by Frenchman or Spaniard. This handsome\r\nsuccess, the just reward of intelligent measures vigorously executed,\r\nraised the spirit of the nation, and Rodney sprang at once from\r\ncomparative obscurity, outside his own profession, into universal\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nI will again treat the operations in West Indies and on the coast of\r\nNorth America as the main stream of the war, and therefore follow\r\nRodney’s flag for the present. He reached Santa Lucia on the 27th March\r\nto find Sir Hyde Parker anchored at Gros Islet Bay, and menaced in his\r\nturn by a superior French force. Until the middle of the month, Sir\r\nHyde had been engaged in watching La Motte Picquet and the Comte de\r\nGrasse at Fort Royal, and in covering the arrivals and departures of\r\nthe merchant-ship convoys. In common with all other naval commanders\r\non the West Indian stations, he looked forward to taking a share in\r\nthe recapture of our lost islands and in the conquest of the French\r\npossessions. About the middle of March he was expecting to be joined by\r\ntransports conveying troops under General Vaughan from North America,\r\nand therefore took port to windward—which is to eastward—of Martinique\r\nto meet and protect them. On the 21st the junction was effected,\r\nand at the same time Parker heard that the French were expecting\r\nreinforcements from Europe. He left Commodore Collingwood with four\r\nsail of the line to look out for them, and returned to Santa Lucia\r\nwith the other twelve of his command, and General Vaughan’s troops.\r\nThe French at Fort Royal had in the meantime divided. Part had gone\r\nto San Domingo with La Motte Picquet. The Comte de Grasse remained\r\nwith the others to wait for the fleet coming from France. Immediately\r\nafter Parker anchored at Choque Bay, in Santa Lucia, his look-out ships\r\nreported that they had seen a great French convoy entering Fort Royal.\r\nOn the top of this report Commodore Collingwood ran into Choque Bay\r\nwith his detached squadron, and the news that he had been chased by\r\nsixteen French sail of the line, had escaped them, had met four sail\r\nof Rodney’s squadron which that officer had sent on, and had sent them\r\nback to their admiral with the information that the French were in\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThe newcomers were the powerful fleet fitted out at Brest, and they\r\ncame under the command of Luc Urbain de Bouëxic, Comte de Guichen,\r\na man of sixty-two, and one of the most interesting figures in the\r\nFrench Navy of the day. He represented at once all that was best in\r\nthe French _noblesse_ of his generation, its virtues of good breeding,\r\nhigh personal honour, and loyalty—all that was most accomplished in\r\nthe scientific training of the French naval officer of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and all that was most fatal in their theories of the conduct\r\nof war. No man handled a fleet with more precision or with greater\r\nelegance, and no man manœuvred with more dexterity not to injure his\r\nopponent, but to baffle that opponent’s attempts to injure him. We\r\nshall see why he fairly divided the honours of the coming encounter\r\nwith Rodney, but it was characteristic of his school, and was its\r\ncondemnation, that his active career was to end in the Bay of Biscay\r\ntwo years later in failure and discredit, simply through the breakdown\r\nof the manœuvring he loved under the direct thrust of Kempenfelt. On\r\nthe 23rd March he joined Grasse at sea to windward of Martinique.\r\nHaving now twenty-four sail of the line to Parker’s sixteen, he\r\nprepared for the reconquest of Santa Lucia, and appeared to leeward\r\nof the island on the 24th. He was not quick or energetic enough to\r\nprevent Parker from covering the entry of another convoy of troops\r\nfrom Barbadoes, which came in round the north end of the island, on\r\nthat day; nor did he intercept Rodney, who joined Parker on the 27th,\r\nraising the total British force to twenty-two of the line, and taking\r\nup the command.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd April Rodney put to sea in search of Guichen. The French\r\nadmiral followed the usual course of officers of his service. Though\r\nequal in number to his opponents, he declined battle, remained at\r\nanchor under the guns of Fort Royal, and waited till the absence\r\nof the British fleet should offer him an opportunity to strike at\r\none of the British Antilles. Rodney returned to Gros Islet, leaving\r\nfrigates to watch. On the 15th April, Guichen came out, having with\r\nhim a detachment of troops commanded by Bouillé. Rodney was instantly\r\ninformed of his movements, and started in pursuit. On the 16th April he\r\nsighted the French twenty-four miles west of the Pearl Rock, a little\r\nisland outside Fort Royal. On the following morning he was to windward\r\nof his enemy, having twenty sail of the line to Guichen’s twenty-two.\r\nThe French had stood off to the N.W. when sighted, and had been\r\nfollowed by the British. Both fleets were to leeward of Martinique.\r\nAt 6.45 a.m. Rodney signalled that he intended to attack the enemy’s\r\nrear, and at 7 a.m. ordered his line to close till the ships were\r\nat one cable’s length from one another. The order to bear down was\r\ngiven at 8.30. Both fleets were heading to the N.W., and the French\r\nwere very much extended. There was a gap between their rear and their\r\ncentre. Guichen seeing that his rear division was in peril, at once\r\nreversed the order of his van and centre, and stood to the south to its\r\nassistance. He thereby closed the gap, and as his rear turned also to\r\nthe south, it became the van. Rodney was thus baffled, and drew off,\r\nresuming his course to the north. Guichen then turned his fleet in the\r\nsame direction, and the two again stood to the northward side by side\r\nout of gun-shot. At 11 a.m. Rodney hoisted the signal to engage. It was\r\nhis intention that his fleet should steer for the enemy’s rear with the\r\nships at a cable’s length apart. His captains unfortunately understood\r\nthe signal to attack the rear as applying only to the first movement.\r\nBrought up in the old faith of the Fighting Instructions, they fought\r\nas they had been trained to fight—steering van to van, centre to\r\ncentre, and rear to rear. Rodney’s plan to concentrate his whole\r\nforce on a part of the enemy was spoilt, and the battle to leeward of\r\nMartinique ended as many others had done, with a great deal of damage\r\nto the spars of the British ships and the retreat of the French little\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\nThis failure remained a subject of bitter regret to Rodney. At the time\r\nand afterwards he attributed it to the deliberate misconduct of his\r\ncaptains, who, he said, let the French escape in a factious spirit of\r\nopposition to the king’s Government. More credible explanations are:\r\nthe influence of unintelligent rules of tactics; and his own partly\r\nvaletudinarian and partly arrogant solitude. If he had explained to\r\nhis captains the principles on which he meant to fight, his orders\r\nwould not have been misunderstood, and it would have been impossible\r\nthat they should have been disobeyed. The merit of his proposed plan\r\nis manifest when it is compared with the mechanical rules of the\r\nFighting Orders. Yet that merit may be, and has been, exaggerated. Such\r\na concentration as he designed could always be answered by an enemy\r\nwho was prompt to reverse his order and to close his line, as Guichen\r\nshowed in the early hours of the day. So long as the British fleet\r\nengaged to windward, there could be but indifferent security that the\r\nenemy would not cripple its rigging and slip away. Rodney, in short,\r\nset the example of innovating on the formal tactics of the time, but\r\nbefore great results could be obtained much more had to be done than he\r\nshowed himself prepared to do on the 17th April 1780.\r\n\r\nThe operations following the battle were marked by no decisive event.\r\nRodney, after keeping for a few days between Guichen and Fort Royal,\r\nreturned to Choque Bay to refit. Several of his ships, and the flagship\r\namong them, the =Sandwich=, had been severely damaged. Guichen, after\r\nvisiting the Dutch island of St. Eustatius to procure stores, stationed\r\nhimself to windward—that is, to the west of Martinique. His object was\r\nto effect a junction with a Spanish squadron under Admiral Solano,\r\nwhich was known to be on its way from Europe. Rodney followed him.\r\nExasperated by the want of support he had suffered from in the last\r\naction, he put his fleet through a severe course of manœuvres, and drew\r\nthe reins of discipline tight with a severity which aroused the wrath\r\nof his subordinate, Sir Hyde Parker, who on his return home was with\r\ndifficulty restrained by the advice of Sandwich from creating another\r\nnaval scandal. Twice Rodney came close enough to Guichen to bring\r\non partial actions—on the 15th and 19th May. But the Frenchman was\r\nresolved not to be brought to close action. He had the weather-gage,\r\nand kept it so carefully that only the van ships of the British line\r\ncame into action with the rear of the French as the two fleets passed\r\non opposite tacks. It was characteristic of the spirit and principles\r\nof the French Navy of the time that Guichen was much praised for, and\r\nwas visibly proud of, his success in baffling Rodney’s attempts to\r\nbring him to battle. Rodney, who might have cut off two or three of\r\nthe rearmost French ships if he had ordered his van to steer into the\r\nenemy’s line, was not prepared to depart wholly from the old methods.\r\nOn the 21st May, Guichen, whose ships were in want of repairs, went off\r\nto the northward, and Rodney lost sight of him. The French returned to\r\nFort Royal, and the English to Barbadoes.\r\n\r\nAt Carlisle Bay, in that island, on the 22nd May, Rodney was joined\r\nby the =Cerberus= frigate. Her captain, Mann, brought news that when\r\ncruising off Cadiz he had sighted a Spanish squadron of twelve sail\r\nof the line on the 2nd May, with a convoy of merchant-ships. He had\r\nfollowed it for days, had convinced himself that it was bound for\r\nthe West, and had left his station to warn Rodney. Sir George, who\r\nreceived further information from Lisbon, put to sea to intercept the\r\nSpaniard, who he concluded was bound for Martinique. But Don José\r\nSolano steered a more northerly course, and on the 10th June effected\r\na junction with Guichen at Guadaloupe. Rodney had been reinforced by\r\nfive ships of the line while to windward of Martinique, but was now so\r\nmuch outnumbered by the united Spaniards and French that he returned\r\nto Gros Islet Bay and stood on his guard. Nothing was attempted by\r\nthe enemy. The Spaniards were horribly sickly and in no condition for\r\nservice, while several French ships were worn out. On the 5th July\r\nthe allies separated, Solano going to Havana, and Guichen to Cape\r\nFrançois, in San Domingo, from whence on the 16th August he sailed\r\nfor Europe. Rodney was joined at Santa Lucia by reinforcements under\r\nCommodore Walsingham on the 12th July, but no opportunity for action\r\nwas presented by the enemy. The hurricane season, during which the West\r\nIndies are dangerous, had begun, and the trade had to be seen safe to\r\nEurope. Rodney sent off the merchant-ships convoyed by Sir Hyde Parker,\r\ndetached ten of the line under Rowley and Walsingham to Jamaica, and\r\nsailed himself with ten ships of the line to North America.\r\n\r\nOn the North American station the British squadron had been commanded\r\nsince the latter part of 1779 by Rear-Admiral Marriott Arbuthnot,\r\na somewhat dull man of impracticable temper. During May he had\r\nco-operated with Sir Henry Clinton in the occupation of Charlestown,\r\nbut during the rest of the year he had been checked by the appearance\r\non the coast of a French squadron of nine sail of the line under the\r\nChef d’escadre D’Arzac de Ternay. Ternay had sailed from Brest on the\r\n2nd May, escorting 9000 troops under Rochambeau. On the 20th June,\r\nnear Bermuda, he fell in with four British sail of the line under\r\nCornwallis, who was escorting a flock of merchant-ships homeward bound\r\nthrough the Florida Straits. The two squadrons cannonaded one another\r\nfeebly. Ternay having “his mission to fulfil,” would not stop to crush\r\nCornwallis, and went on to Rhode Island, which he reached on the 11th\r\nJuly. Arbuthnot, who was reinforced by Graves on the 13th July, made\r\npreparations to co-operate with the army in an attack on the French;\r\nbut delays followed one another, and no attack was made. The brief\r\nstay of Rodney on the station was not marked by any active operation.\r\nArbuthnot looked upon him chiefly as a competitor for shares of prize\r\nmoney, and was angry at his intrusion. Sir George, whose health\r\nsuffered in the keen air of a northern autumn, reached New York on the\r\n22nd September, and was back in the West Indies on the 12th December.\r\n\r\nIn home waters the war was conducted with languor on both sides after\r\nRodney’s relief of Gibraltar. The British Government having to meet\r\ncalls all over the world, could only collect some thirty sail of the\r\nline in the Channel, which were successively led by Admiral Geary, a\r\nworn-out veteran, and Admiral Darby. Geary, after a cruise in June\r\nand July, during which he made a few prizes of merchant-ships,\r\nresigned in August. One object of his cruise was to see a large convoy\r\nof ships bound to the East and West Indies safe out of reach of the\r\nFrench and Spanish fleets. It was to be guarded when clear of European\r\nwaters by Captain Moutray in the =Ramillies=, 74, with the =Thetis=\r\nand =Southampton= frigates. The convoy consisted of five East India\r\nCompany’s ships, of eighteen transports carrying a regiment to the West\r\nIndies, and of forty West Indian merchant-ships. Moutray left Spithead\r\non the 29th July. He was allowed two other line-of-battle ships till\r\nhe was 300 miles beyond the Scilly Isles. He met Geary at sea, and\r\nwas escorted by the grand fleet till he was some 340 miles west. Then\r\nhe was left, the admiral thinking that he was now safe. But he was\r\nrunning into extreme peril. The French had sent the Chef d’escadre\r\nBausset with seven of the line and the Spanish ships at Brest to join\r\nDon Luis de Córdoba at Cadiz. While they were there, secret information\r\nof the sailing of the convoy and of the weakness of Moutray is said,\r\nby Spanish historians, to have reached the Prime Minister of Spain,\r\nthe Count of Floridablanca. He at once ordered Córdoba and Bausset to\r\nsail and intercept the prize. They were right across Moutray’s route\r\nwhen, on the 8th August, in Lat. 36° 40 N. and Lon. 15° W., their sails\r\nwere seen on the horizon at sundown from the masthead of Moutray’s\r\nadvance ship. Thinking the sails belonged to neutral ships, he held on\r\ntill night. Then the number of lights reported as seen ahead made him\r\nalter his mind. He signalled to his convoy by gun-fire to lie to with\r\ntheir heads to the west, and then, again by gun-fire, ordered them\r\nto continue their course. It was his meaning that they should go as\r\nthey were then pointing. The captains of the Indiamen, transports, and\r\nmerchant-ships understood that they were to resume the course they were\r\non before they lay to, which was to the south. His signals had been\r\nheard by the allies, who steered for the sound of the guns. So when the\r\nsun rose on the 9th August, Moutray with his solitary 74 and frigates\r\nwas well out to the west and to windward. The sixty-three ships under\r\nhis charge were sailing right into the arms of a big French and Spanish\r\nfleet, which closed on them, and carried them all into Cadiz. It was\r\nthe greatest disaster suffered by British commerce since Tourville had\r\nscattered the Smyrna convoy. The necessity for satisfying the public\r\nby making an example led to Moutray’s trial by a court martial, and he\r\nwas reprimanded. In truth, nothing he could have done would have saved\r\nhis convoy when once it was close to so great a force. He lived to be\r\nappointed as Commissioner of the Dockyard at Antigua, and to have some\r\ndifficulties with Nelson.\r\n\r\nThe allies returned in triumph to Cadiz, and their success encouraged\r\nthe Spaniards to persevere in the war. A great fleet collected in the\r\nport in October,—Spanish ships, Frenchmen from Brest and from Toulon,\r\nand Guichen with a worn-out squadron from the West Indies; but it did\r\nnothing, and scattered to winter quarters.\r\n\r\nIn 1781 the war grew in intensity. Disputes arising partly out of the\r\nexercise by the British Government of its claim to take an enemy’s\r\ngoods out of a neutral ship, and partly out of the encouragement given\r\nto the Americans by the city of Amsterdam, led to a declaration of\r\nwar on the Dutch Republic by Great Britain in December 1780. To guard\r\nagainst an attack by the Dutch on the trade with the Baltic, from\r\nwhence our naval stores were mainly drawn, it was necessary to station\r\na squadron in the North Sea, which threw an additional burden on the\r\nalready heavily taxed navy. Every ship which could be patched up for\r\nservice had to be put into commission. The number of vessels in “full\r\nsea pay” was 398, and 90,000 men, including 20,000 marines, were voted\r\nto form the crews.\r\n\r\nSo many were the calls on the navy that it was not possible to collect\r\nsufficient line-of-battle ships for service in home waters. The nominal\r\nsuperiority of the allies was overwhelming, but the difference between\r\npaper and real strength has rarely been better shown than in this year.\r\nThe Dutch were not ready. The French, though incomparably the most\r\nformidable of our enemies, could not man and officer all their ships\r\neffectively. The Spaniards were miserably inefficient. France and Spain\r\nalike were intent on pushing the war in America, or in endeavouring to\r\nrecover Minorca and Gibraltar. Both dreaded the dangers of the Channel.\r\nThus no resolute effort was made to assail Great Britain itself. In\r\nAmerica our enemies gained, by the intelligent use of their fleets,\r\nthe success which established the independence of the United States.\r\nIn European waters the British Government was compelled to leave the\r\ngarrison of Minorca to its fate. After a siege begun on the 18th August\r\n1781, it surrendered on the 4th February 1782. Yet the foundations of\r\nour power were not only not shaken, but were not seriously menaced.\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the story of the war in American waters, it will be\r\nconvenient to show how the heart of the empire was guarded, and how\r\nthe forces on both sides started for operations in distant seas. The\r\nBritish Government had to provide first of all for the free movement of\r\nits trade—a task greatly complicated by the war with Holland. Then it\r\nhad to reinforce its squadrons in America, to endeavour to strengthen\r\nits general position by seizing the Dutch possessions at the Cape,\r\nand by providing for the safety of Gibraltar. The great fortress was\r\non a superficial view a mere burden on the fleet throughout the war.\r\nThree great armaments had to be sent for its relief first and last.\r\nTwo of them were provided only by leaving the Channel with small or\r\nno protection. Some English public men were of opinion that it might\r\nbe profitably exchanged for an island in the West Indies. Yet it\r\nattracted a large part of the enemy’s forces which might have been\r\nemployed with more damaging results to us elsewhere. It is true that\r\nfor this we have to thank the want of intelligence of our opponents.\r\nTo recover Gibraltar was an object for which the King of Spain was\r\nprepared to make every effort, and he could think of no other way of\r\ntaking it than by direct siege. His Ambassador in Paris, the Count of\r\nAranda, had sagacity enough to see that it might be recovered “in the\r\nheart of Jamaica.” Aranda could, however, secure no hearing. So long\r\nas our opponents were intent on mastering Gibraltar by bombardment and\r\nblockade, the obvious interest of England was to keep it from capture.\r\nNor could the pride of the nation be reconciled to the surrender of\r\nthis trophy of former wars. Its importance to the ultimate interests\r\nof the naval power of Great Britain was to be amply proved in the next\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nTo provide for the free movement of the trade a small squadron of one\r\nline-of-battle ship and a few frigates was stationed early in the year\r\non the east coast of Scotland. Privateers, American and French, had\r\nalready been active in those waters, and were now to be reinforced\r\nby the Dutch, who, when once at war, set vigorously to work to make\r\nup for the neglect of their fleet in previous years. Commodore Keith\r\nStuart, who was in command of the small protecting force, found it\r\ninsufficient. The history of the war in the North Sea during 1781 shows\r\nwith what difficulty and at what a cost trade is carried on when the\r\ncommand of the sea is disputed. The =Artois= frigate was appointed\r\nto protect the merchant-ships bound to the Baltic. During the spring\r\n200 merchant-vessels collected in the Firth of Forth. They were\r\ndetained at first by weather, and then by orders from the Admiralty,\r\nwhich feared that they would be captured by Dutch frigates. Their\r\nprovisions were consumed and heavy expenses incurred. In the meantime\r\nanother flock of trading-ships had been collected on the east coast,\r\nand was sent to the Firth of Forth under the protection of a squadron\r\ncommanded by the Vice-Admiral Parker whose services in the West\r\nIndies have been mentioned. He came up from the Downs collecting the\r\ntraders on his way. On the 10th June he had collected his charge, 500\r\nmerchant-ships in all, at Leith. Before he could see them on their way,\r\nthe homeward-bound convoy from Jamaica came in—seventy trading-craft\r\nunder the protection of four sail of the line, one 50-gun and one\r\n44-gun ship—much battered by storms, and infested with scurvy after a\r\nlong voyage. The West Indiamen stopped only to obtain fresh vegetables,\r\nand then continued their voyage to the South. On the 27th June Parker\r\nsailed, saw his convoy safe to the Baltic, and then cruised in the\r\nNorth Sea, waiting for the homeward-bound ships.\r\n\r\nThe condition of Parker’s squadron shows that the Admiralty had indeed\r\nbeen driven to sore straits to provide protection for the North Sea\r\ntrade. After he had been joined by Stuart with the =Berwick=, 74, he\r\nwas able to make up a line of seven vessels in all, but it was only\r\nby including two which were not line-of-battle ships—the =Preston=,\r\n50, and the =Dolphin=, 44. The =Princess Amelia=, 80, was nominally\r\na strong ship, but she was so crazy with age that it had been found\r\nnecessary to reduce her armament. She carried only 24-pounders on\r\nthe lower deck instead of 32-pounders, and the rest of her guns were\r\n18-pounders and 9-pounders. Parker’s flagship, the =Fortitude=, 74, and\r\nthe =Berwick= represented the solid part of his command. If the Dutch\r\nhad been able to send an equal squadron of strong ships, it would have\r\ngone hard with “Vinegar” Parker. Happily for him and for the interests\r\nof British trade, the Dutch had to make shift with the old and weak\r\nwhen they needed the new and strong. On the 20th July a squadron of\r\nseven ships, to form the line, and a number of frigates sailed from\r\nthe Texel with a large fleet of merchant-ships under their protection.\r\nThe admiral in command was the Schout-bij-nacht Johan Arnold Zoutman,\r\nan elderly officer, of the same stamp as his English opponent, an\r\nexcellent practical seaman beyond doubt, and a stout-hearted man, but\r\nnothing more. His line of seven was made by including three ships\r\nof 54 guns and one of 40. The largest of his ships was the _Admiral\r\nGeneraal_, 74, commanded by Captain Kinsbergen. Zoutman’s flag was in\r\nthe _Admiraal de Ruiter_, 68, and one 64-gun ship, the _Holland_, made\r\nup the tale. Other two ships were sent out to accompany the convoy, but\r\nwere not available for an action with the British squadron.\r\n\r\nContrary winds and the usual obstructions inseparable from the task\r\nof convoying a swarm of clumsy merchant-ships delayed Zoutman’s\r\nmovements. It was not till the first days of August that he was clear\r\nof the shallows of the Dutch coast. In the meantime, the British trade\r\nhomeward bound from the Baltic had collected behind Parker. On the 5th\r\nAugust the Dutchman bound northward, and the Englishman southward,\r\nsighted one another on the Dogger Bank, in a north-westerly wind—Parker\r\nbeing to the windward and westward. Each admiral sent his convoy on its\r\nway, and both prepared for a fair trial of strength.\r\n\r\nThe battle which followed has an almost pathetic interest. It was one\r\nof the last fought on the old traditional rules, and it was fought\r\nby men who played the game with a single heart. Therefore it showed\r\nwhat was best in those rules, their downright manhood, and what was\r\nweakest, their hidebound pedantry. Zoutman seeing that Parker had\r\nthe weather-gage and the option of battle, lay to on the port tack,\r\nheading to the north. Sir Hyde Parker bore down to engage from van to\r\nrear, every man to take his bird. His flagship was in her orthodox\r\nplace, the middle, which in a line of seven was the fourth. Zoutman\r\nwas the fifth in his line. Now the proper opponent for an admiral\r\nis an admiral. Parker therefore laid the =Fortitude= alongside the\r\n_Admiraal de Ruiter_. But as there were three ships ahead of him and\r\nthree astern, while there were four ships ahead and two astern of\r\nZoutman, it followed that there were three English to four Dutch in\r\nthe van, and three to two in the rear. The last ship of Parker’s line\r\nhad consequently no opponent. In the van the =Berwick=, 74, was very\r\nrightly laid alongside the leading Dutchman, the _Erzprinz_, 54. The\r\nsecond English ship tackled the third Dutchman, and the third the\r\nfourth. Therefore the second Dutchman had no opponent. Yet every ship\r\nwas kept in its position, since the signal for the line was flying. Not\r\na shot was fired by the Dutch as their enemies came down to the attack.\r\nThey lay quiet, with their marines admirably pipeclayed drawn up on\r\ntheir poops. When the other sportsman was comfortably in his place,\r\nZoutman opened fire. English and Dutch pounded one another with stolid\r\nresolution. The loyalty of the seamen of the time to the superstition\r\nof the line of battle was wonderfully shown in the van. Commodore\r\nStuart had rightly closed with the leading Dutch ship to prevent her\r\nfrom getting to windward and doubling on the head of our line. The\r\n=Berwick= being a far heavier ship than the _Erzprinz_, was able to\r\ndrive her to leeward. In following up the attack the =Berwick= fell\r\nto leeward, and then finding herself out of her proper place, tacked\r\nback to resume her station. The battle was a cannonade of three hours\r\nand a half. At the end of that time the Dutch drew off, and Parker did\r\nnot pursue. His ships were severely damaged, and his casualty list,\r\n111 killed and 318 wounded, was a more severe loss than any suffered\r\nin action with the French in this war, in proportion to the number\r\nengaged. Zoutman returned to port, and Parker continued his voyage\r\nhome. The safe arrival of the Baltic convoy was a subject of very\r\nnatural rejoicing, and much was made of Parker’s “victory,” though\r\nvictory there was none. He for his part was discontented, and resigned\r\nhis command, saying, we are told, that he wished the king younger\r\nadmirals and better ships. At a later period he was chosen to command\r\nin the East Indies. He sailed in the =Cato=, 50, for his station. His\r\nfate is unknown, for he never reached his destination, and no trace of\r\nhim was left, save a vague story that a great ship, which may have been\r\nhis, had been wrecked on the coast of Malabar, and that the survivors\r\nof the crew had been massacred by the natives.\r\n\r\nWhile these operations were running their indecisive course in the\r\nNorth Sea, two great armaments had sailed from Spithead and from Brest,\r\neach on a distant mission, and each carrying with it subordinate\r\nsquadrons to be detached for still more remote destinations. On the\r\n13th March Admiral Darby sailed from Spithead with twenty-eight\r\nline-of-battle ships. Some were to be detached to the West Indies, and\r\nothers to sail for the Cape of Good Hope and take it from the Dutch,\r\nwhen Darby’s immediate service was performed. He had also with him the\r\noutward-bound East Indiamen. His orders were to collect the vessels\r\nladen with provisions in Irish ports for the use of the garrisons of\r\nGibraltar and Mahon, to convoy them to the fortresses, to detach the\r\nreinforcements for the West Indies, and the squadron destined to the\r\nCape with the East Indiamen under its charge, and to return to the\r\nChannel. To meet the victuallers, he steered for the south coast of\r\nIreland, and was there delayed till they joined him from Cork. While\r\nDarby was waiting on the south coast of Ireland the Comte de Grasse\r\nleft Brest on the 22nd March, with twenty sail of the line, bound for\r\nthe West Indies, and having with him a small squadron to be detached\r\nfor an attack on the British settlements in the East Indies. Darby,\r\nhaving collected his victuallers, went on his way, and Grasse on his\r\nwithout a meeting. The strenuous futility which is conspicuous in the\r\noperations of all parties in this war was never more visible than in\r\nthis misuse of two great fleets. If Darby had fallen on Grasse and had\r\ndriven him back to Brest, the Americans would have been deprived of\r\nthe aid which enabled them to take Yorktown at the close of the year.\r\nIf Grasse had been joined by even six or eight Spanish ships in an\r\nefficient state, and had fought a whole-hearted battle with Darby off\r\nthe Old Head of Kinsale, it is possible that the entire naval defence\r\nof Great Britain might have been ruined, and it is eminently probable\r\nthat the relief of Gibraltar would have been stopped—in which case the\r\nfortress must have fallen for it was at the end of its resources. But\r\nthe rulers in London and Paris had their eyes on the end of the earth\r\nand could not see that victory at home would mean success all over the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe web of naval warfare covered the North Atlantic, the threads\r\ncrossed, the shuttle flew to and fro. All were players in the same game\r\nand each acted on the other. The squadrons detached to the Cape and\r\nthe Indian Ocean by Darby and Grasse went into a wider field and acted\r\napart. The North Sea was a field by itself, but the other fleets and\r\nsquadrons from Newport in Rhode Island, down the East Coast of America\r\nto the West Indies, across the Atlantic to the Straits of Gibraltar,\r\nand north to the Channel, worked together, and on one another in\r\nharmony or in conflict. Let us see how the players stood when Darby\r\nsailed from the south of Ireland for Gibraltar, and Grasse steered from\r\nBrest for the West Indies.\r\n\r\nWhen the year began the French squadron of seven sail of the line and\r\ntwo frigates lay at Newport. It was commanded by Chevalier Destouches,\r\nwho succeeded to the command on the death of Ternay, on the 15th\r\nDecember 1780. Arbuthnot was in command of the British squadron of\r\neight ships of the line, two 50-gun ships, and twenty-three frigates,\r\nwith his headquarters at Long Island. His ships had to patrol the\r\ncoast and to co-operate with the British forces acting in the southern\r\nColonies. In January he sailed to reconnoitre the French, but on the\r\n23rd his squadron was beaten back by a violent gale. The =Culloden=,\r\n74, was lost on the end of Long Island, and the =Bedford=, 74,\r\ndismasted. The =America=, 74, was driven out to sea, and did not rejoin\r\nhis flag for weeks. Washington throughout the year was striving to\r\nbring about a concentration of French and American forces on either the\r\nnorthern or southern parts of the divided British. He urged Destouches\r\nto put to sea while Arbuthnot was disabled. But the Frenchman was\r\noppressed by anxiety lest the stormy weather should be as fatal to\r\nhim as to his opponent. He sent Le Gardeur de Tilly with one 64 and\r\ntwo frigates to fall on the British transports of Arnold’s force in\r\nVirginia. The French officer found that they had taken refuge in\r\nElizabeth River, and returned. On his way to Rhode Island he captured\r\nthe =Romulus=, 44, and a number of prizes. Meanwhile Arbuthnot lay at\r\nGardiner Bay in Long Island. Under the steady driving of Washington,\r\nDestouches got to sea on the 8th March, with seven of the line and two\r\nfrigates—one of them the captured =Romulus=, and 1500 French soldiers\r\nunder Viomesnil, to reinforce the Americans in Virginia. On the 10th\r\nArbuthnot followed him with eight ships of the line and two frigates.\r\nThe two steered for the Chesapeake in squally weather, mists, and\r\ndriving rain. The English squadron was the quicker of the two. On\r\nthe 16th March it overtook the French between forty and fifty miles\r\nN.E. by E. of Cape Henry. It was in the power of Arbuthnot to put\r\nhimself to leeward of Destouches, and between him and the coast in the\r\nnorth-easterly wind. But faithful to tradition he let the Frenchman run\r\nto leeward of him, and then made two rushes at him in the old style.\r\nThe Frenchman as usual fired to dismast and slipped away. Yet Arbuthnot\r\nwas the more pertinacious of the two. After an inconclusive action\r\nhe anchored at Lynn Haven in the Chesapeake, and Destouches, finding\r\nthe road still barred, went back to Rhode Island. Arbuthnot came back\r\nto Long Island, having at least baffled the enemy’s attempt to carry\r\nreinforcements to Virginia, so that at the close of March both were\r\nagain “as they were” at Long Island and at Newport.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events of no very honourable character had occurred in the\r\nWest Indies. Rodney had returned to his station, the Leeward Islands,\r\nfrom North America on the 12th of December 1780. He was soon joined by\r\nSamuel Hood with reinforcements from Europe. Hood, when the war began,\r\nhad been commissioner of the dockyard at Portsmouth. The acceptance\r\nof this post was by custom held to mark an officer’s final retirement\r\nfrom active sea service. But the Admiralty wished to supply Rodney\r\nwith a second in command who would work more harmoniously with him than\r\nParker. Hood had served under Rodney’s eye at the beginning of his\r\ncareer. He had been captain of the =Vestal=, from which Rodney directed\r\nan attack on a French flotilla in 1759. The refusal of many flag\r\nofficers to take commands while Sandwich remained First Lord supplied\r\nanother reason for departing from usage. Hood, who was no political\r\npartisan, or who at least was no Whig, was included in a promotion\r\nof flag officers, and was sent with reinforcements and a large trade\r\nconvoy to the West Indies. Soon after he joined, the =Childers= sloop\r\nbrought news of the outbreak of the war with Holland.\r\n\r\nNo more welcome message could have reached the ear of Sir George,\r\nfor it brought to a very embarrassed man the hope of infinite prize\r\nmoney. The Dutch Island of St. Eustatius, lying high up in the Lesser\r\nAntilles, had been used for the purpose to which the British port of\r\nNassau in the Bahamas was put in the American Civil War. It had become\r\na great dépôt of contraband, by which the French profited largely. It\r\nwas also the seat of an unwonted trade of more legitimate character.\r\nThe West Indian planters were under the necessity of buying all the\r\nfood for their slaves in the North American colonies. As the supply\r\ncould not be stopped without producing ruin to the British Islands,\r\nGovernment was compelled to relax the rigour of its navigation laws,\r\nand permit the planters to obtain supplies through neutral ports. This\r\nauthorised trade concentrated at St. Eustatius. Maize and pork were\r\nbrought from America, and British goods were brought to pay for them.\r\nLong rows of warehouses sprang up on the usually empty shore of the one\r\nlanding place of the Dutch island.\r\n\r\nThe news that St. Eustatius was fair prize reached Rodney on the 27th\r\nJanuary. On the 3rd February he seized the island. The neighbouring\r\nport of Saba was taken at the same time, and a Dutch convoy was\r\nfollowed and captured. From that moment and for the ensuing weeks\r\nRodney became blind to the interest of his country and to his own\r\nhonour in the contemplation of the stupendous mass of booty which was\r\nat last to make him a rich man. A part of his force was to have sailed\r\nto seize the Dutch possessions on the mainland of South America. The\r\nadmiral would not part with a ship. Essequibo and Surinam were left\r\nto be taken by a swarm of privateers. There was no French force in\r\nthe Leeward Islands except four of the line at Fort Royal. Lest they\r\nshould come to molest him at St. Eustatius Rodney stationed the bulk\r\nof his fleet outside that port. In vain did Hood, who was detached\r\nfor the blockade, point out that the belt of calm under the land of\r\nMartinique, the fitful breezes, and the westerly set of the current\r\nin the Caribbean Sea made it impossible to lie close up to the land\r\nand intercept reinforcements coming to the French from Europe. In vain\r\ndid he ask leave to cruise to windward of Martinique on the track of\r\nany French force which might be coming. Rodney, reduced to the moral\r\nlevel of a buccaneer, would think of nothing except that if Hood were\r\nto windward of the island, the French at Fort Royal might slip out\r\nand recapture the booty at St. Eustatius. There he himself remained\r\nsuperintending the sorting and packing of the spoil. In that position\r\nthey were at the end of April when Grasse was seen coming round the\r\nsouth end of Martinique on the 28th April.\r\n\r\nWhile the French admiral was crossing the Atlantic Darby had carried\r\nout the relief of Gibraltar. He saw the ships ordered to the East\r\nIndies safe on their way, and on the 11th April was off Cadiz. His\r\nlook-out frigates counted thirty-six Spanish sail of the line at anchor\r\nin the port. They had grown foul while blockading the fortress, and\r\nhad run out of stores. They were in fact “wanting in everything at the\r\ncritical moment,” as Wellington was to find the Spanish armies at no\r\ndistant day. Córdoba, their admiral, was a man of childlike faith and\r\npiety. When a French officer came to expostulate on the scandalous\r\nspectacle presented by a fleet of thirty-six sail which allowed a\r\nweaker force to relieve the fortress under its eyes, he left his cabin\r\nwith his rosary in his hand. He listened to the carnal arguments of the\r\nFrenchman, and then replied with saintly unction, that it had pleased\r\nGod to make the English stronger on the present occasion, but that he\r\nwould doubtless give the superiority to the Spaniards in his own good\r\ntime. He then went back to his prayers. Darby was allowed to carry\r\nhis convoy into Gibraltar, and to despatch others to Mahon not yet\r\nbesieged. He met no opposition from the Spaniards except from a few\r\nrowing gunboats, which fired at him from a respectful distance, when\r\nthe breeze had fallen. On the 19th April he sailed for home—his work\r\ndone. He swept close by Cadiz, “lifting his leg on the Spaniards” as\r\nHorace Walpole puts it, but they would not come out.\r\n\r\nOn his way back he missed a piece of service which would have given\r\nhim a well-earned reward. While he was to the south the convoy which\r\nRodney had taken from the Dutch, together with much of his booty, was\r\non its way home. Another rich convoy was due from Jamaica. The French\r\nGovernment had news of them, and sent six sail of the line and four\r\nfrigates and sloops to intercept them. La Motte Picquet fell in with\r\nRodney’s prize convoy about sixty miles to the west of the Scilly\r\nIsles. They were under the protection of Commodore Hotham with two\r\nline-of-battle ships and three frigates. Seeing the superiority of the\r\nFrench, Hotham ordered his convoy to disperse, and drew his warships\r\ninto a line. But the Frenchman followed the booty and Hotham was not\r\nalert enough to molest him. Twenty of the convoy were taken. La Motte\r\nPicquet, satisfied with his gains, now turned home to Brest. It was\r\nwell for him that he did. Darby was informed of the capture of Hotham’s\r\nconvoy, and at once sent Rear-Admiral Digby with a squadron to effect\r\nits recapture. But Digby never sighted the chase. The look-out ship\r\nof the main force with Darby, the =Nonsuch=, 64, commanded by Captain\r\nSir James Wallace, fell in with one of La Motte Picquet’s ships, the\r\n_Actif_, 74, commanded by M. de Boades, and the two fought a desperate\r\naction, which lasted through hours of the night of the 14th May.\r\nBoth were severely mauled. The =Nonsuch= lost twenty-six men killed,\r\nand sixty-four wounded; the _Actif_ fifteen killed and thirty-eight\r\nwounded. The action may be quoted to prove that there was at this time\r\nno difference in efficiency between the best ships in the French navy\r\nand our own. La Motte Picquet took his prizes into Brest, and with them\r\nthe fortune of Rodney. Little was left to the admiral except a ruinous\r\nseries of lawsuits, brought against him by British merchants engaged in\r\nthe authorised trade at St. Eustatius, whose goods he had impounded\r\nwithout discrimination. The Jamaica convoy got safe to port. Darby\r\nanchored at Spithead on the 22nd May.\r\n\r\nOn that very day Rodney was hurrying from Antigua to Barbadoes to make\r\ngood the consequences of his mismanagement in March and April. On the\r\n28th April the Comte de Grasse was seen coming round the southern end\r\nof Martinique, and now began a series of operations in which all the\r\nmovements of the British fleet were dictated by the French admiral,\r\nand all led up to loss. Hood, held back to leeward by Rodney’s orders,\r\nthe wind, the calm, and the current, could do nothing to prevent\r\nhis opponent from hugging the shore and reaching Fort Royal with\r\nhis warships and convoy. On the 29th Grasse was joined by the four\r\nline-of-battle ships in the fort. On that day, on the 30th and on the\r\n1st May, encounters took place between the two fleets. Grasse, having\r\nulterior objects to achieve, would not allow himself to be drawn into\r\nclose action. The well-trained French captains of guns made excellent\r\npractice. Several of Hood’s ships suffered severe damage in their\r\nspars, and one, the =Russell=, 74, was badly injured on the water-line.\r\nAll of course were proportionately disabled for working to windward.\r\nHood, finding himself outmatched in force and his fleet diminished by\r\ndamage, drew off to the north and sent the injured =Russell= into St.\r\nEustatius. She reached it on the 4th May, and brought Rodney the first\r\nnews that Grasse had reached Martinique. He sailed to join Hood on the\r\n6th with the two ships of the line he had kept with him, and on the\r\n9th joined his subordinate between Montserrat and Antigua. Injuries to\r\nships and want of stores made it necessary for him to take the whole\r\nfleet to the dockyard at Antigua.\r\n\r\nGrasse, having the Caribbean Sea open before him, free to go where he\r\npleased and strike where he chose, left Fort Royal on the 9th May to\r\nretake Santa Lucia. The attack was made on the 11th and 12th without\r\nsuccess. The strength of the British posts on Pigeon Island, the Morne\r\nFortuné, and the Vigil enabled General St. Leger to hold out. He was\r\naided by a small squadron under Commodore Linzee. The discovery that\r\nthe British posts were strong, and apprehension that Rodney might\r\nappear, induced the French admiral to embark the soldiers he had landed\r\nand return to Fort Royal. Rodney was indeed at sea, and had steered to\r\nassist Santa Lucia. He received news of the retreat of the enemy when\r\nnear Barbadoes on the 23rd May. As that island was ill prepared for an\r\nattack, and his fleet still in need of stores with many sick in the\r\ncrews, Rodney anchored in Carlisle Bay. Grasse had decided to fly at\r\nlesser game, and was content to retake Tobago. An advance squadron of\r\nhis fleet first appeared off the island. It had been detached before\r\nthe attack—which the French historians, with some economy of truth,\r\ncall a false attack—on Santa Lucia. Colonel Ferguson, the Governor of\r\nTobago, appealed for help to Rodney, and the admiral, who received the\r\nmessage on the 27th May, sent Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Drake on the\r\n29th with three ships of the line, three frigates, and three sloops to\r\nhis assistance. Hardly was Drake out of sight before news came that\r\nGrasse had sailed on the 22nd from Fort Royal apparently bound for\r\nTobago. Rodney was in no small anxiety for his subordinate, but Drake,\r\nwho sighted the whole French fleet off Tobago on the 30th, retreated\r\nin time. The French had landed at Great Courland Bay on the 24th, and\r\nFerguson, who had but four hundred men and some armed blacks, retreated\r\ninto the hills, hoping to hold out till Rodney could come. But Bouillé\r\narrived on the 31st May. He was ever a partisan of “thorough,” and well\r\nknew there was no time to waste. By his orders two plantations were\r\nfired _in terrorem_, and the clamours of the planters, who formed a\r\nlarge part of his force, compelled the governor to surrender on the 2nd\r\nJune. When Rodney came from Barbadoes on the 3rd the mischief was done.\r\nUntil the 9th both fleets manœuvred along the string of small islands\r\ncalled the Grenadines, till Rodney, finding that he could not bring his\r\nenemy to close action, returned to Barbadoes, and Grasse went north to\r\nFort Royal.\r\n\r\nStrenuous futility continued to be the note of the operations on both\r\nsides. The end of all this display of force by Grasse had been the\r\ntransfer of a small island from England to France. In Paris there was\r\nindeed a very general belief that Grasse had not done enough. His\r\nnephew, who carried home his despatches reporting the operations off\r\nFort Royal from the 29th April to 1st May, had a very cold reception\r\nfrom the king. The admiral’s excuse that the British ships were all\r\ncoppered and sailed better than his own was grimly received. If we\r\nare to accept it the French officer deserved high credit for baffling\r\nRodney’s efforts to bring him to battle between the 3rd and 9th\r\nJune—credit, that is, for skill if not for high spirit. The English\r\nreader may be excused for not accepting it at once, for, if it is well\r\nfounded, Rodney was grievously to blame for allowing himself to be\r\nbaffled. But this lament of want of speed is heard on both sides, till\r\nwe are almost forced to regard it as a standing excuse. Sir George’s\r\nfailure can be sufficiently explained by the fact that his mind had\r\nbeen clouded by a passion of avarice at St. Eustatius, and that his\r\nhealth was breaking down. He was not free either in body or mind to\r\ngive minute attention to his command. His solitary habits grew on him,\r\nand his second in command, Hood, angered by the distant hauteur of his\r\nchief, paid sullen and exact obedience to orders and held his peace. In\r\nhis letters he repaid himself by scornful invective.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Fort Royal Grasse prepared for the vigorous campaign\r\nwhich was to redeem his reputation and to decide the war in North\r\nAmerica. All through the war Washington had been eagerly pressing for\r\na combined attack on the British forces either in New York or in the\r\nSouth, and Grasse had orders to co-operate. Washington would have\r\npreferred the first, but when he found that the French preferred the\r\nsecond he accepted the alternative. Grasse left Fort Royal on the 5th\r\nJuly for Cape Français (now Cape Haytien) in San Domingo, taking with\r\nhim a convoy of 200 merchant ships. At Cape Français he received the\r\npressing appeals of Washington and the French authorities to come on\r\nto North America with ships, troops, and bullion. The ships he had,\r\nand he increased them by taking the vessels already at Cape Français\r\nwhich were destined to convoy the trade home. The merchant ships were\r\nordered to remain in the colony till the next season—a bold measure,\r\nwhich would probably have been beyond the courage of a British\r\nadmiral who served a commercial state. Three thousand two hundred\r\ntroops with ten field pieces and a siege train were lent him by M. de\r\nLillancourt, governor of Saint Domingo. Bullion he could not obtain\r\nin the French colony. An appeal to the Spaniards at Havana produced\r\nabout £60,000. On the 28th July Grasse sent the _Concorde_ frigate with\r\nthe announcement that he was coming, and on the 5th August he sailed\r\nthrough the Bahama Channel for the Chesapeake, carrying the troops in\r\nhis warships so as not to be hampered by transports.\r\n\r\nRodney was informed by Captain Forde of =La Nymphe=, who had seen the\r\nFrench at sea on the 5th July, that Grasse had sailed. He at once\r\nconcluded that the French admiral was bound to the coast of America,\r\nand he prepared to reinforce the British squadron on the station.\r\nFor himself he could not go. His health had broken down, and it was\r\nimpossible for him to face an autumn campaign in the searching cold\r\nof the North. He handed over his command to Hood with orders to take\r\nfourteen sail of the line to America, and then on the 1st August sailed\r\nwith a convoy for Europe.\r\n\r\nAll now began to move to the decisive point at Yorktown. Arbuthnot had\r\nresigned his command and had gone home on the 2nd July. His successor,\r\nRear-Admiral Graves, began by sending information to Rodney that the\r\nFrench fleet was believed to be coming from the West Indies. Then\r\nleaving Captain Edmond Affleck at New York he went to sea himself with\r\nsix ships of the line, to intercept reinforcements from Europe for the\r\nenemy, to cover the movements of our own convoys, to watch Boston,\r\nand, if possible, to meet whatever ships Rodney might send him from\r\nthe West Indies. Sir George had acted, as we have seen, on his own\r\ninitiative, and had sent the sloop =Swallow= to report the approaching\r\narrival of Hood. The =Swallow= reached New York on the 27th July, and\r\nwas sent on by Affleck to meet Graves at sea. She unhappily fell in\r\nwith two privateers, by whom she was driven on shore and destroyed. The\r\n=Active=, sent by Hood to report that he was coming, was also taken,\r\nand neither message reached Graves. Hearing nothing, and being in want\r\nof stores, the admiral returned to Sandy Hook on the 16th August.\r\nHood in the meantime had sailed from Antigua on the 10th August, and\r\non the 27th he was off the Chesapeake. Finding no British force there\r\nhe went on to Sandy Hook on the 28th. Forty-eight hours after he had\r\ngone Grasse arrived with twenty-eight sail of the line, and two 50-gun\r\nships. He anchored at Lynn Haven. Thus Lord Cornwallis, who had been\r\ncompelled to evacuate the Carolinas, and had marched through Virginia\r\nto Yorktown, where all his troops were collected by the 22nd August,\r\nwas cut off from communication with New York by sea, while Washington,\r\nwith the American troops, and Rochambeau, with the French, were\r\ngathering round him by land.\r\n\r\nWhether he could have been saved from the superior forces collecting\r\nabout him is perhaps doubtful. Whatever chance he had was lost through\r\nwant of aid from General Clinton in New York, who continued to believe\r\nthat he, and not Cornwallis, would be attacked. The violent controversy\r\nbetween the generals does not require to be dealt with here. On the\r\nreturn of Graves, Clinton urged him to attack the French squadron at\r\nNewport. The admiral had, however, to reprovision his ships, and he\r\nreceived two pieces of information in quick succession which disposed\r\nof any plan for an attack on Newport. On the 16th August =La Nymphe=\r\njoined him with the report that Hood was on his way, and a few days\r\nlater he learnt that the French squadron, commanded since the 6th\r\nMay by the Chef d’escadre Barras de San Laurent who had superseded\r\nDestouches, had sailed to the southward. When Hood appeared off the bar\r\nof Sandy Hook, Graves came out to join him on the 1st September, and\r\ntheir united forces steered for the Chesapeake to intercept Barras.\r\nOn the 5th September the British fleet of twenty-one sail of the line\r\nwas off Cape Henry, and the advance ship, the =Solebay=, signalled the\r\npresence of a French fleet in Lynn Haven. Admiral Graves formed his\r\nline of battle and stood on. Grasse shipped his cables and stood out\r\nwith twenty-four of the line, forming his array as he went. When the\r\ntwo were nearly opposite one another, the British to windward in a fine\r\nbreeze from the N.N.E., Graves wore his fleet together, and bore down\r\non the enemy, both lines being on the port tack and heading to sea. A\r\nsudden shift of the wind and a shoal called the Middle Ground hampered\r\nthe movements of the fleets. The British line was not all brought into\r\naction, for it struck on the enemy at an angle, thus only the van under\r\nRear-Admiral Drake was closely engaged. The rear under Hood might have\r\nbrought the enemy to close action if it had been allowed to break\r\nthe line. But Graves adhered to the old rule which prescribes the\r\nmaintenance of the same formation throughout a battle. So the French\r\nwere once more allowed to slip away after crippling several ships of\r\nthe British van, and damaging one, the =Terrible=, 74, so severely that\r\nit was found necessary to take her men and stores out, and set her on\r\nfire on the 11th. Both fleets remained out for some days without again\r\ncoming to action. On the 9th Grasse returned to Lynn Haven. During\r\nhis absence Barras had slipped in with six sail of the line, bringing\r\nwith him the battering train about to be used against Cornwallis at\r\nYorktown. He found two British frigates, detached by Graves to cut away\r\nthe buoys left by Grasse on his anchors, and captured them both. After\r\ndestroying the =Terrible=, Graves looked into the Chesapeake again,\r\nand finding the enemy too strong to be attacked, sailed away to Sandy\r\nHook, which he reached on the 19th September. Cornwallis was left to\r\nhis fate. Graves was joined on the 24th by Rear-Admiral Digby with\r\nthree sail of the line, and the news of his appointment to the Jamaica\r\nstation, and a few days later by two other ships from the West Indies.\r\nHe sailed on the 17th October on a forlorn effort to save Cornwallis,\r\nwho had been forced to surrender on that very day. The British fleet\r\nlooked again into the Chesapeake, saw that all was over, and returned\r\nto Sandy Hook. Graves then handed over the command to his successor,\r\nDigby, and left for his new station.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Yorktown was the practical end of the war in North America.\r\nWhile Cornwallis’s army was undergoing its fate, the allies had made\r\nanother idle demonstration at the mouth of the Channel. Thirty-six\r\nsail of the line, under Don Luis de Córdoba, appeared at its entrance\r\nearly in August, while thirteen others cruised on the coast of Ireland\r\nto intercept trade. Darby, weakened by the departure of Digby for\r\nAmerica, was with difficulty reinforced to thirty sail, and had to\r\nlie at anchor in Torbay. The allies, who had come on the very tardy\r\nreflection that the best way to prevent relief to Gibraltar or Minorca\r\nwas to watch the mouth of the Channel, did not dare to attack him. They\r\nfeared to be crushed in detail if they attacked in line ahead, and were\r\npersuaded they had no room (they might have been persuaded that they\r\nhad no seamanship), to attack in line abreast. On the 14th September\r\nDarby put to sea to make an effort, and found the enemy gone. They had\r\nin fact separated on the 5th September in wretched health. The French\r\nwent home to Brest, the Spaniards to Cadiz, whence eighteen of the\r\nleast inefficient of them sailed under Don Miguel Gaston to escort the\r\ntreasure ships from America. In the absence of an enemy the service was\r\nsuccessfully performed. Darby remained at sea till November to protect\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE CLOSE OF THE WAR AND THE EAST INDIES\r\n\r\n AUTHORITIES.—_Naval and Military Memoirs of Great Britain_, by\r\n     Beatson; _Naval Chronology_, by Isaac Schomberg; _Memoirs\r\n     and Correspondence of Lord de Saumarez_, by Ross; _Life and\r\n     Correspondence of Rodney_, by Mundy; _Life of Viscount Keppel_,\r\n     by T.

The\r\nallies had now to secure prizes for themselves. Gibraltar was to be\r\ntaken in Europe and Jamaica conquered in the West Indies. On the 4th\r\nNovember 1781 Grasse sailed from the Chesapeake for Martinique, where\r\nhe anchored on the 25th. On that day his unresting military colleague,\r\nBouillé, pounced in his characteristically feline style on St.\r\nEustatius. He landed where no landing was expected. The red coats of\r\nthe Irish regiment of Dillon, which formed part of his force, disarmed\r\nsuspicion, all the more easily because no watch was kept. The Governor\r\nwas splashing in his bath when the French came down upon him, and so\r\nthe loss of St. Eustatius was added to the chapter of regrettable\r\nincidents. Grasse and Bouillé were now free to push their enterprises\r\nagainst the British West Indies, opposed for the time being only by the\r\ninferior fleet under Hood, who had sailed from Sandy Hook on the 11th\r\nNovember and had reached Barbadoes on the 5th December. The French\r\nofficers had been instructed to expect reinforcements to be brought\r\nto them from Europe by Vaudreuil. If strengthened in the way promised\r\nthey would have held a commanding position. The French Government took\r\nmeasures to keep its word, but its plans were shattered by a brilliant\r\nstroke of vigilance and activity delivered by the British Navy.\r\n\r\nIt was known in London that a great force was in preparation at Brest,\r\nand measures were taken to intercept it at its starting place. On the\r\n2nd December, Kempenfelt, who had succeeded Digby as second in command\r\nin the Channel, left Spithead with twelve sail of the line and one\r\n50-gun ship. The calculation was sound, and Kempenfelt sailed in good\r\ntime, but the force given him might well have proved insufficient.\r\nGuichen left Brest on the 10th December with nineteen sail of the line\r\nand a convoy carrying troops. His orders were to detach Vaudreuil to\r\nthe West Indies with five sail and the transports, to send two to the\r\nEast Indies, to post La Motte Picquet with two others where he would\r\nmeet the trade coming home from San Domingo, and to take the others\r\nto Gibraltar. Kempenfelt had been delayed by the weather, but on the\r\n12th December he sighted the French 150 miles to W.S.W. of Ushant.\r\nThey were to the southward of him in a south-easterly wind. Guichen\r\nand the warships were ahead on Kempenfelt’s lee or starboard bow as\r\nhe came down on the port tack. The transports and merchant ships were\r\ndirectly behind Guichen and were therefore uncovered. Haze and fog,\r\nwith clear intervals, surrounded both fleets and hid the approach of\r\nthe English, but the French admiral’s disposition was unpardonable. He\r\nought to have kept his convoy to leeward of him. If Kempenfelt had been\r\nan unenterprising man he might have hesitated to attack where he was\r\nmenaced by a superior force, but he was as bold as he was seamanlike,\r\nand he did not hesitate to punish his opponent for his error. He\r\ndashed straight on in a general chase, each ship going at her best\r\nspeed with frigates and two deckers ahead, swept past the stern of the\r\nFrench warships, and broke into the convoy. Fifteen transports were\r\ncaptured, with 1062 soldiers on board. The rest scattered in terror.\r\nGuichen, confused by the consequences of his own want of foresight,\r\nand perhaps by the fog, allowed his opponent to collect his warships,\r\nwhich had been separated by the chase, and to round up his prizes\r\nbefore night. Kempenfelt detached Captain Caldwell in the =Agamemnon=\r\nwith =La Prudente= to pursue the convoy. Five more fell into Captain\r\nCaldwell’s hands. Guichen returned rather piteously to Brest, and the\r\nblow delivered to the W.S.W. of Ushant was felt by Grasse in the West\r\nIndies. Kempenfelt anchored at Spithead on the 20th December.\r\n\r\nHe was a man to be remembered for this fine feat, for a long career of\r\ngood service, and for his efforts to provide the navy with a better\r\ncode of signals. He is remembered because he was the admiral whose\r\nflagship, the =Royal George=, went down at Spithead on the 29th August\r\n1782, carrying with her Kempenfelt, most of his officers, hundreds\r\nof seamen, and also very many women with some children, the families\r\nof the men. They were allowed to remain on board while the ship was\r\nfitting for sea. The =Royal George= was receiving a parliamentary heel,\r\nthat is to say she was weighed down on her side at the anchorage in\r\norder to clean her partially below the water line. According to the\r\nexplanation which satisfied the Admiralty, she sank because the water\r\nran in at the ports. But the navy, which indeed was rarely charitable\r\nin its judgment of the Admiralty, was of opinion that a piece fell\r\nout of her side under the strain, for she was notoriously rotten. It\r\nwas said that the decision not to attempt to raise her was due to the\r\nprudent resolution of My Lords that the truth should not be revealed.\r\nShe had been built in 1756.\r\n\r\nThough disappointed of the reinforcement promised him, Grasse was\r\nstill much stronger than Hood. He could collect twenty-nine sail,\r\nwhile the English officer could only hope to muster twenty-two—until\r\nRodney returned from Europe. On the 5th January 1782 he left Fort\r\nRoyal on an expedition against the British islands, St. Christopher\r\nand Nevis. Hood at Barbadoes was informed on the 8th that the French\r\nwere at sea. Scouts were despatched to observe their movements, but it\r\nwas not till the 14th that a letter from General Shirley, Governor of\r\nSt. Christopher, told Hood that they had been seen off Nevis, and that\r\ntheir destination became clear. Hood sailed at once for Antigua. He\r\nhad twenty-one sail of the line with him, but expected to be raised\r\nto twenty-two by the junction of the =President=. With this force,\r\ninferior in number as it was to the French fleet, “I beg you will\r\nassure their Lordships,” so he wrote to Sandwich on the 20th January,\r\n“I will seek and give battle to the Count de Grasse, be his numbers\r\nas they may.” The promise was given on the 20th January. On the 21st,\r\nHood was at Antigua. On the 22nd, he embarked General Prescott with a\r\ndetachment of troops, and sailed in search of the French.\r\n\r\nThe little island of Nevis lies directly west of Antigua. To the north,\r\nand separated from it by the shallow strait appropriately called the\r\nNarrows, is the larger island of St. Christopher, commonly called St.\r\nKitts. The capital of St. Kitts, Basseterre, is on the south-western\r\nside of the island. Here Grasse had anchored on the 11th January and\r\nhad landed soldiers, who drove Governor Shirley and General Fraser, the\r\nofficer in command of the troops and island militia, to take refuge on\r\nBrimston Hill, close to the shore north-west of Basseterre. During the\r\nnight of the 23rd Hood rounded the south point of Nevis, running before\r\nthe easterly trade. It was his intention to fall on the van of the\r\nFrench at daybreak on the 24th, and crush it at anchor. But during the\r\nnight a careless officer of the watch in the =Alfred= ruined himself\r\nand the admiral’s plan by running into the =Nymphe=. The =Alfred= was\r\ndamaged, and delay was caused by the necessity to repair her. Before\r\nHood could approach the anchorage of Grasse he was seen, and the\r\nFrenchman put to sea with his twenty-nine sail of the line. Hood, whose\r\nfirst object was to land =Prescott=, anchored his fleet on the tail\r\nof a bank to the south-east of the position just left by Grasse. As\r\nhis ships stood in they were attacked by the French in a half-hearted\r\nway. The operation was carried out on the 25th, after a day and night\r\nof weary manœuvring, in which Hood kept the advantage of position, and\r\nGrasse put his fingers to the plough as if he thought it would burn\r\nthem. On the 26th he made two feeble attacks on Hood, and then stood\r\noff. Reinforcements came in and raised his force to thirty-six sail of\r\nthe line, but he did not come on again. He only remained cruising and\r\nwatching till the 14th February.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Prescott had landed and had made an effort to relieve\r\nBrimston Hill. He was beaten back by Bouillé with superior numbers. As\r\nit was obvious that they could do nothing, the troops were embarked on\r\nthe 29th and sent off to Antigua. Hood maintained his anchorage till\r\nall hope was gone. The planters of St. Kitts had suffered severely by\r\nRodney’s confiscations at St. Eustatius, and were sulky. They had not\r\neven mounted the twelve 24-pounders and two mortars given them for\r\ntheir protection. These pieces fell into Bouillé’s hands, and were used\r\nagainst Brimston Hill. When the Frenchman found the siege of the hill\r\nslow work, he took to his usual course of burning the plantations. The\r\nplanters raised a clamour, and under pressure from them Shirley offered\r\nto capitulate on the 13th February. On the 14th, Hood having done all\r\nthat in him lay, summoned his captains to the flagship, instructed them\r\nto set their watches by his, and to get under way at ten that night.\r\nThe fleet slipped off quietly, and without interruption from Grasse,\r\nround the north end of St. Kitts. There is no finer passage of combined\r\ncaution and daring in the war. We had lost the islands, but Grasse had\r\nthrown away the chance to crush the English ships. He no doubt wished\r\nto preserve his own ships for their ulterior purpose, the conquest\r\nof Jamaica. While tendering them he inevitably allowed the escape of\r\nHood’s ships, which were to have a conspicuous share in ruining that\r\nulterior purpose in the following April. Between such opponents, only\r\nthe fitting occasion was required to show beyond all peradventure where\r\nthe superiority lay.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was at hand. Hood reached Antigua on the 19th February. On\r\nthe 22nd he left for Barbadoes, and met at sea Rodney, who had reached\r\nthat island on the 19th. Rodney had left Plymouth on the 14th January\r\nwith twelve sail of the line. He had beaten out of the Channel in the\r\nteeth of the wind, and had rounded Ushant in a gale which sent the\r\nwaves over the deck of his flagship, the =Namur=. He came back to his\r\ncommand somewhat restored in health by an operation he had undergone at\r\nBath, but more aged, more secluded, than ever, and he had to bring with\r\nhim a private doctor, Gilbert Blane. Blane should be mentioned with\r\nhonour in every history of the navy, for he did much excellent work in\r\nintroducing into our ships that cleanliness which means health, which\r\nagain means efficiency and the power to endure. The improvement in this\r\nrespect was already great. Our fleets in the West Indies presented\r\na spectacle such as would have filled the seamen of Queen Anne with\r\namazement. They were showing that it was possible to keep the crews\r\nlong at sea on that sickly station and yet preserve them more free from\r\ndisease than in port and at home.\r\n\r\nRodney took his united command to Gros Islet Bay, in Santa Lucia, and\r\nthere settled down to watch Grasse, who had returned to Fort Royal on\r\nthe 26th February. The next move of the French was a secret to nobody.\r\nGrasse was to ship Bouillé with his soldiers, to go to San Domingo and\r\nthere pick up more French ships and soldiers. Then he was to be joined\r\nby the Spaniards from Cuba, and the whole force was to fall on Jamaica.\r\nThe success of this large scheme depended wholly on the ability of\r\nGrasse to get away with his ships and men from Martinique. It was\r\nRodney’s duty to see that he did not, and under the veil of disease\r\nand premature age weighing on him, he was resolute to do that duty. He\r\ndid not forget the exhortation of Sandwich, that he carried the fate\r\nof the empire in his hands, and he meant to bear his charge worthily.\r\nTherefore he kept strict watch. Neither man nor officer landed except\r\non duty, and a line of frigates kept the French under observation. The\r\nwatch lasted till the 8th April, when Captain Byron of the =Andromache=\r\nfrigate came into Gros Islet Bay with the news that the French were\r\ngetting to sea. Before noon the fleet was at sea, and standing to the\r\nnorth in pursuit of the enemy.\r\n\r\nOf the two fleets about to engage in the greatest and the most decisive\r\nencounter of the war, the English was the stronger. Sir Charles\r\nDouglas, Rodney’s captain of the fleet, did indeed endeavour to show\r\nby comparisons of tonnage and guns that the French though outnumbered\r\nwere materially stronger than ourselves. But our guns were heavy enough\r\nto shatter our enemy, and there were more of them. Moreover, the great\r\nimprovements in gunnery introduced by Douglas himself, and other\r\ncaptains, constituted an element of superiority far more valuable than\r\nany mere weight of the pieces. The average skill of our officers and\r\nmen was higher than the French. Finally, and this was a very important\r\nconsideration indeed, the French admiral was hampered by a great\r\nconvoy. He was compelled to detach the two 50-gun ships out of his\r\ntotal force of thirty-three ships of the line, to guard his transports.\r\nTwo of his liners were disabled by accident on the evening of the 11th\r\nApril. Rodney’s thirty-six ships of the line were all free for fighting\r\nalone, and he lost none by mismanagement.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 8th April the two fleets stood to the north,\r\npast the island of Martinique, and along the west side of Dominica. On\r\nthe morning of the 9th, fifteen of the French ships of the line had\r\nworked clear of the land, and were in the “true breeze” blowing through\r\nthe Saints Channel—the straits between Dominica and Guadaloupe. The\r\nothers and the transports were in the belt of calms under the west side\r\nof the island. Sir Samuel Hood with nine ships of the English van had\r\nworked up as far as the leading French. The others were becalmed under\r\nthe land. The Comte de Grasse had now a magnificent opportunity to\r\ncrush a part of his opponent’s fleet when it could not be supported. He\r\nmade, however, only a very half-hearted attack on Hood, cannonading his\r\nships at a respectful distance from windward, and doing little damage\r\nexcept to the spars. As the other British ships worked up he grew still\r\nmore timid, and the evening came before any decided result had been\r\nobtained. From the evening of the 9th to the evening of the 11th the\r\ntwo fleets continued to struggle with the wind or want of it, rather\r\nthan with one another. Grasse succeeded in working his convoy out from\r\nunder the shadow of Dominica, and sending it to Guadaloupe protected\r\nby the two 50-gun ships. Two of his liners were disabled by bad\r\nseamanship. Yet on the evening of the 11th he had so far succeeded in\r\nhis manœuvres to avoid battle that the bulk of his ships were through\r\nthe passage. Rodney prevented his attempt to get away by ordering “a\r\ngeneral chase.” His quickest vessels were allowed to sail at their best\r\nspeed, and soon overtook the laggards among the French. Grasse was\r\ncompelled to call his whole fleet back to cover the menaced vessels,\r\nand at nightfall both fleets were to westward of the passage again.\r\nDuring the night the _Zélé_, 74, ran into the French flagship, and was\r\nseverely damaged. It was necessary to send her in tow of a frigate to\r\nGuadaloupe. When day broke on the 12th, the fleets were so placed that\r\nGrasse could no longer avoid a battle. The French were to the north of\r\nRodney, and both fleets were in the easterly trade wind. Ships were\r\nsent from the British van to pursue the crippled _Zélé_ on her way to\r\nGuadaloupe. Grasse, to cover her, called down the ships to windward of\r\nhis flag, and began to form his line. Sir George, who had been roused\r\nin the morning by the flag-captain with the welcome news that “God\r\nhad given him his enemy on the lee bow,” made prompt answer to the\r\npreparations of the Frenchman. Time would have been lost by waiting\r\nfor the return of the ships pursuing the _Zélé_. The rear, therefore,\r\nwas ordered to lead into action. The last ship in the line stretched\r\nup towards the French, the next fell in behind her, and so on till the\r\norder of the fleet was reversed; the rear became the van and the van\r\nthe rear, the pursuing ships taking their places as they returned. The\r\nfleets approached one another on a converging line forming an obtuse\r\nangle, the French having the wind on the port, and the British on the\r\nstarboard side. Rodney’s order to engage the enemy close to leeward was\r\nhoisted at about 8 a.m. The leading ship of his line reached the third\r\nin the French at 7.45 a.m., and then bearing up, began to pass along\r\nthe French line on the lee side. Others followed in their order, and\r\nthe two went past one another slowly, the English in excellent order,\r\nfiring rapidly and steadily, the French in ragged disorder, fighting\r\ngallantly but at a growing disadvantage. When the leading English ship\r\nhad just passed the last French, and the two lines were side by side\r\nfrom end to end, there occurred the movement which gives this battle\r\nits peculiar importance in naval history.\r\n\r\nThe action had lasted for about two hours, and the confusion in the\r\nFrench fleet had been increased by the shift of the wind to the\r\nsouthward, which forced the head of the line towards the English. A\r\ngreat gap was formed in the formation of the French astern of the\r\nseventeenth ship. Sir Charles Douglas, who saw the opening, urged\r\nRodney to pass through it and cut the French line. The movement was\r\neasy, for the English ships were not close-hauled, and by putting the\r\nhelm down could pass to windward through the opening. Sir George\r\nhesitated before assuming the responsibility of departing from the\r\nrule that an admiral should not alter the formation in which he began\r\nan action. On the second and urgent appeal of his captain of the\r\nfleet, he consented to make the movement. The helm of his flagship,\r\nthe =Formidable=, 100, was put down, and she passed through the enemy,\r\nfollowed by the vessels immediately astern of her. One of the vessels\r\nahead, the =Namur=, 90, followed the admiral’s example. All the ships\r\nof the English line, counting from the last of the centre to the rear,\r\npassed through another gap in the French, in the smoke, without knowing\r\nwhat they had done till they found themselves to windward of the enemy.\r\nThus the fleet of the Comte de Grasse was broken into three fragments.\r\nThe van bore on to the south. Six ships cut off in the centre turned\r\nwestward. The rear ships were headed off from the isolated fragment of\r\nthe centre.\r\n\r\nThe wind now fell, and the two fleets remained for a space motionless.\r\nWhen it rose again, the English streamed down on the isolated Frenchmen\r\nin the centre. They were surrounded, overpowered, and compelled to\r\nsurrender. The flagship, the _Ville de Paris_, 100, was surrendered by\r\nGrasse after a long and gallant fight. It was the general opinion in\r\nthe fleet that an insufficient use was made of the victory, and that\r\ntwenty prizes might have been taken if Rodney had been more energetic.\r\nSir Samuel Hood, a bitter judge of his superior, had some difficulty in\r\nobtaining leave to follow the enemy on the 18th April. He took three\r\nother prizes in the Mona Channel on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe battle of the 12th April, or of the Saints, or of Dominica, for\r\nit is known by all names, may be said to have been the end of the\r\nnaval war in America; for no operations of any consequence took place\r\nthere till the peace of the following year. The discontent of Rodney’s\r\ncaptains was not made public. To the nation which had seen no such\r\nsuccess in the war hitherto, the victory appeared wholly glorious,\r\nand was a very natural subject of triumphant satisfaction. Rodney was\r\nmade a peer of Great Britain, and Sir Samuel Hood received an Irish\r\npeerage. In naval history the battle is chiefly remarkable because it\r\nmarked the end of the old formal, or rather pedantic, style of fighting\r\nestablished in the seventeenth century. It showed naval officers by\r\npractical example that the way to win decisive victories was to break\r\ninto the formation of the enemy, even if they did thereby sacrifice\r\ntheir own, and so bring about a mêlée in which individual superiority\r\nwould have full play.\r\n\r\nThe war can now be wound up by a brief account of the final relief of\r\nGibraltar and of the contemporary naval campaigns in the East Indies.\r\n\r\nDuring September of 1782 Gibraltar received, and had repelled with\r\nease, the last attack of the Spaniards and their French allies.\r\nFloating batteries, from which much had been expected, were brought\r\nagainst the fortress in vain. But as the allies were masters of the\r\nStraits, the garrison was in danger of being reduced by starvation.\r\nReliefs of stores and men were urgently needed. The British Government\r\nwas hard pressed to find ships for the service. A Dutch squadron was\r\nknown to be ready for service in the Texel, and as the concentration of\r\nFrench and Spanish warships in front of Gibraltar made the employment\r\nof a large force necessary, the Ministry was in no small perplexity\r\nlest, while Gibraltar was being relieved, the coast of England\r\nshould be attacked. But the Dutch were timid. The naval advisers of\r\nthe Government, of whom Keppel, then at the head of the Admiralty,\r\nwas one, convinced it that the risk was not great. Public opinion,\r\ntoo, would not have tolerated further delay. On the 11th September,\r\ntwo days before the final attack of the allies, Howe left Spithead\r\nwith thirty-four sail of the line, eight frigates, and a number of\r\nfireships. He had under his protection a convoy of transports carrying\r\nprovisions, military stores, and two regiments of infantry, the 25th\r\nand the 59th. Every effort had been made to provide the admiral with\r\nthe best force the country could collect. But the navy was severely\r\ntaxed to meet the calls made upon it. Many of the ships had been fitted\r\nout with difficulty, and though the best officers and men available\r\nwere sent on the service, complaints were heard that the crews were\r\nmade up by the inclusion of inferior elements. At a later period the\r\ncondition of Howe’s fleet was the subject of an undignified squabble\r\nbetween him and Keppel.\r\n\r\nBad weather delayed the progress of the relieving fleet. Howe was off\r\nFaro on the 9th of October. Here he heard of the failure of the attack\r\non Gibraltar, and that the fortress was safe so far. Skilful management\r\nwas still required to carry the transports into the harbour in face of\r\nthe superior numbers of the enemy, and the obstacles caused by currents\r\nand winds. His iron nerve, his seamanship, and his mastery of the\r\ndetails of a great fleet qualified Howe for the work admirably. Yet\r\neven he could not have succeeded at all against efficient opponents,\r\nnor against such enemies as he had, if he had not been to some extent\r\nbeholden to fortune. The help fortune gave him came in a shape which\r\nin no way diminished the honour due to his fleet. On the night of the\r\n10th October it blew a heavy gale from the west. The awkward French\r\nand the more than awkward Spaniards suffered severely at their station\r\nin Algeciras Bay. One Spaniard was driven ashore, and lost, under the\r\nguns of Gibraltar. Some were dismasted, others were swept into the\r\nMediterranean. The good seamanship of Howe’s officers and men showed\r\nonce more that the winds and waves are in favour of the more skilful\r\nnavigator. They contended successfully with the gale. By the evening\r\nof the 11th October the transports had been brought to the entrance\r\nof Gibraltar Bay, and the warships were to windward of them for their\r\nprotection. A few only entered. The great bulk of the transports,\r\nunable to bear up against the westerly wind and the current which sets\r\ninto the Mediterranean, were “back-strapped”—that is to say, they were\r\ncarried past Gibraltar into the inland sea. Howe had to follow his\r\ncharge as far as Fuengirola on the 12th. He collected the transports at\r\nthe Zaforina Islands, and placed his warships to protect them. Don Luis\r\nde Córdoba, the Spanish admiral who commanded the allies, followed the\r\nEnglish into the Mediterranean, not to seek battle, but only to cover\r\nthose of his ships which had been driven to the eastward. Fog, rain,\r\nand the heavy groundswell following on the storm put the seamanship of\r\nnaval officers and skippers of the transports to a severe test, but\r\nthey were equal to their task. The wind had shifted to the N.E. during\r\nthe night of the 15th. By the 18th victuallers and transports were\r\nsafe in Gibraltar. On the 19th the enemy were seen to windward. Having\r\nrelieved the fortress, Howe did not think proper to accept battle in\r\nthe narrow space between Ceuta and Europa Points. He stood into the\r\nAtlantic. Next day the allies, who were still to windward of him, made\r\na feeble attack on the van and rear of his line. They then drew off.\r\nHowe, who had not absolute confidence in all his captains, and who\r\nwas by nature rather resolute and exact than adventurous, played his\r\ngame with caution. On the 21st the allies went off, and gave him no\r\nopportunity to strike with advantage. He remained cruising till the\r\n28th October, when he detached Sir Richard Hughes with eight sail to\r\nthe West Indies, and then steered home. He anchored at Spithead on the\r\n14th November. He had done an admirable piece of service. If it was\r\nrather a triumph in the handling of a fleet and in seamanship than such\r\na triumph in fighting as Nelson would have won twenty years later, we\r\nmust remember that much had happened in the interval to give British\r\nofficers a well justified confidence.\r\n\r\nWhen the war died down on the Atlantic and in the West Indies, it was\r\nstill being fiercely waged in the Bay of Bengal. In those waters it\r\nhad flamed into energy only as it drew towards its final crisis and\r\nend elsewhere. Until 1782 the Eastern seas presented a languid scene.\r\nIn 1778 England and France were alike feebly represented at sea to\r\nthe east of the Cape. When the Company, hearing that war had begun\r\nin Europe, resolved to seize the French settlement of Pondicherry,\r\nit had a squadron at hand. One line-of-battle ship, the =Ripon=, 60,\r\nthree small men-of-war of the Royal Navy, and one armed ship of the\r\nCompany’s, constituted the whole force commanded by Sir Edward Vernon.\r\nThe still weaker French squadron was at the Île de France. Vernon\r\nblockaded Pondicherry on the 8th August, in order to support Sir Hector\r\nMunro’s besieging army. On the 10th the French squadron appeared. It\r\nconsisted of the _Brillante_, 64, two small ships of the king’s, and\r\ntwo armed merchant-vessels. A feebly conducted action ended by the\r\nseparation of the combatants. The French commander, M. de Tronjolly,\r\nanchored at Pondicherry, and remained there till the 21st August. He\r\nbrought no effective help, and when Vernon began to threaten him again,\r\nhe slipped away, leaving Pondicherry to resist as it best could, till\r\nit was forced to surrender on honourable terms on the 16th October.\r\nThe French had ceased to be rivals of England in the East Indies, and\r\nwould in all probability never have reappeared there, if the Company\r\nhad not found a new and a most formidable enemy in Hyder Ali, the great\r\nSultan of Mysore. Their few ships remained, partly by necessity, but\r\nnot a little by the free choice of their officers, at and about the\r\nCythera of the French Navy, the Île de France. Tronjolly was replaced\r\nin 1779 by M. D’Orves, who brought a 74-gun ship with him, _L’Océan_.\r\nIn January 1781, D’Orves made a transient appearance on the coast of\r\nCoromandel. His tardy arrival and prompt departure served only to\r\ndisappoint and anger Hyder Ali.\r\n\r\nVernon’s successor, Sir Edward Hughes, who came out in 1779 in the\r\n=Superb=, 74, had no French enemy to consider; but when the Dutch\r\njoined the enemies of England he co-operated with the Company’s forces\r\nin capturing all their posts on the Coromandel coast. On the 11th\r\nJanuary 1782 he aided in the taking of Trincomalee, in Ceylon, where a\r\ncapture of Dutch trading-ships laid the foundation of the great fortune\r\nhe won during his command. On the 8th February he was back at Madras,\r\nand on the following day he was joined by Captain Alms, who brought\r\nwith him the =Monmouth=, 64, =Hero=, 74, and =Isis=, 50, and also the\r\nnews that a new and unwonted opponent was about to intrude on the\r\nsolitary reign of the British forces in the Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\nIt has been noted above that when Admiral Darby sailed from Spithead\r\non the 13th March 1781 to relieve Gibraltar he had with him a squadron\r\nand a convoy carrying troops which were to be sent on for more distant\r\nservice. These were the eight men-of-war commanded by “Governor”\r\nJohnstone, and the transports carrying troops under General Meadows.\r\nTheir immediate object was to conquer the Dutch settlement at the Cape.\r\nThe Dutch, aware of their own weakness, had appealed to the French\r\nGovernment for support. The French, willing to support their allies,\r\nand also hoping to inflict a severe blow on England by co-operating\r\nwith Hyder Ali, gave their aid. When the Comte de Grasse sailed for\r\nthe West Indies from Brest on the 22nd March 1781 he had with him five\r\nships of the line and transports carrying troops which were to be\r\ndetached—in the first place to rescue the Cape, and then to aid Hyder\r\nAli. The French squadron was commanded by the only officer of whom\r\nit can be said that he was the only “great captain” our navy had been\r\ncalled upon to meet since it had fought the Dutchman De Ruyter one\r\nhundred and ten years before.\r\n\r\nPierre André de Suffren de Saint-Tropez, born in 1729 at St. Cannat in\r\nProvence—in the modern department of the Bouches du Rhone—was the third\r\nson of the Marquis de Saint-Tropez. Like many other younger sons of\r\nProvençal families, he was provided for by being placed in the Order of\r\nMalta (_i.e._ St. John of Jerusalem), and also in the French Navy. He\r\nbecame a Garde de la marine in 1743, and from that day till 1781 had\r\nbeen in almost constant service either in the French Navy or in “the\r\ncaravans of the Religion,” as the cruises of the galleys of Malta in\r\nthe Levant and on the coast of Africa were officially called. He had\r\ntaken part in nearly all the few successes and the most conspicuous\r\ndisasters of the French Navy for some forty years. His reputation\r\nas a good practical seaman and vigorous officer was undisputed. His\r\nexperience had given him a fiery scorn for the pedantic tactics of his\r\ngeneration. They were in his opinion merely decent cloaks for timidity.\r\nIn 1781 he was still only Knight of the Order, and had not as yet\r\nreceived the dignified office of Bailli of Provence, from which came\r\nhis popular name of “the Bailli.”\r\n\r\nOn the 29th March, Suffren parted from the main fleet of the Comte\r\nde Grasse when in the latitude of the Azores. He was soon aware that\r\nCommodore Johnstone was ahead of him. A Portuguese fishing-boat spoken\r\nby one of his squadron informed him that the English squadron had\r\npassed. It must have appeared very doubtful to Suffren whether he\r\ncould hope to overtake and pass it. Several of his transports were\r\nheavy sailers, and some of his ships were in want of water. In order\r\nto procure more, it was necessary to make for the Portuguese island\r\nSt. Iago, in the Cape de Verd Islands, and to anchor at Porto Praya,\r\non the south side. On the 16th April the French squadron came round\r\nthe south-east point of the island in straggling order. One of their\r\nships was towing a transport. As the harbour came in sight the leading\r\nFrench vessel saw that it was full of ships and that several of them\r\nwere men-of-war. Johnstone had, in fact, anchored at Porto Praya on\r\nthe 11th of the month, in a slovenly and unofficerlike way, with his\r\ntransports and warships confusedly mingled. If Suffren had been an\r\northodox French officer of the stamp of Guichen, he would have seen an\r\nexcellent opportunity to “fulfil his mission,” and would have hurried\r\non, prepared to risk suffering from want of water, in hope to reach\r\nthe Cape first. Suffren reasoned as Hawke would have done. What he saw\r\nwas an admirable opportunity to cripple Johnstone, and he attacked.\r\nThat his own squadron was not in hand was to him a small matter. It\r\nwas ten in the morning, and he calculated that many of the English\r\nsailors would be ashore in search of water and stores. The confusion of\r\nJohnstone’s squadron was obvious. Suffren saw that the rain was falling\r\non the just and the unjust, and he struck his blow. For the neutrality\r\nof Portugal he showed no more respect than had been shown by Boscawen\r\nwhen he pursued La Clue into the waters of Lagos, where Suffren, then a\r\nlieutenant in _L’Océan_, had been taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe action of Porto Praya is one which is at once difficult to tell\r\nin detail but easily summed up. Five vessels composed his command—_Le\r\nHéros_, 74 (flagship), _L’Annibal_, 74, _Le Vengeur_, 64, _L’Artésien_,\r\n64, and _Le Sphinx_, 64. When he stood in at the head of his squadron,\r\n_L’Annibal_ and _L’Artésien_ were close to _Le Héros_. Suffren could\r\nnot lie to for the _Vengeur_ and _Sphinx_, lest he should be carried\r\nto the leeward by wind and current. He struck in at once among the\r\nhuddle of Johnstone’s squadron, composed of the =Hero=, 74, =Monmouth=,\r\n64, =Romney=, 50 (flagship), =Jupiter=, 50, and =Isis=, 50, and three\r\nfrigates, which were mixed with East Indiamen and transports. There\r\nwas a wild scene of cannonading, collisions, boardings and attempts\r\nto board, in which the three ships which were closely engaged did,\r\nand suffered, much damage. They were not in force to overpower\r\nJohnstone, and the _Sphinx_ and _Vengeur_ not only came up late, but\r\ndid not press their attack close. After a couple of hours’ hot work,\r\nSuffren cut his cables and left the anchor he had dropped to hold him\r\nin position during his attack. He was followed out by the _Annibal_\r\nand _Artésien_ and the East Indiaman =Hinchinbroke=, which had been\r\ncaptured. Johnstone followed his opponent at leisure and timidly. The\r\n=Hinchinbroke= was retaken, but no zeal was shown to renew the action.\r\nJohnstone, a blustering, pamphleteering man of no reputation as an\r\nofficer, made an attempt to conceal his own want of conduct and spirit\r\nby bringing Captain Sutton of the =Isis= to a court martial, by which\r\nhe was honourably acquitted, and the two fought a series of lawsuits.\r\n\r\nThough his attack failed to achieve victory, it showed the English\r\nnaval officers that in Suffren they had an opponent of an enterprising\r\nspirit rare in the accomplished service to which he belonged. He had so\r\nfar gained his object that Johnstone remained at Porto Praya repairing\r\ndamages till the 1st May. In the meantime the French officer pushed\r\non, and reached the Cape on the 21st June. The troops he landed under\r\nthe command of Count Conway were sufficient to garrison the Dutch\r\nsettlement against the English expedition. While Suffren was refitting\r\nat False Bay, the English squadron appeared on the coast. It made no\r\nattempt to assail the French squadron or the colony, but several Dutch\r\nEast Indiamen which had anchored in Saldanha Bay were captured on the\r\n22nd of July. After cruising for a time off the Cape, Johnstone sent\r\nCaptain Alms to India, and went first to Saint-Helena, and then home.\r\nOn the 26th August Suffren left the Cape for Port Louis, which he\r\nreached on the 25th October.\r\n\r\nThe French squadron, composed of the ships already in the islands\r\nand those brought out by Suffren, sailed from Port Louis on the\r\n7th December 1781. It consisted of _L’Orient_, 74, _Le Héros_, 74,\r\n_L’Annibal_, 74, _Le Sévère_, 64, _Le Bizarre_, 64, _Le Vengeur_, 64,\r\n_Le Sphinx_, 64, _L’Artésien_, 64, _L’Ajax_, 64, _Le Brillant_, 64, _Le\r\nFlamand_, 64, together with seven frigates, sloops, and gunboats. The\r\ncommand was held by M. D’Orves; but Suffren, who though only _capitaine\r\nde vaisseau_, had local rank in the Indies as _Chef d’escadre_, was\r\nappointed to succeed on the death or resignation of his superior.\r\nD’Orves, whose health was ruined, broke down in the Bay of Bengal,\r\nresigned his command on the 3rd February 1782, and died on the 9th. On\r\nthe 3rd, therefore, Suffren was again in command. His struggle with the\r\nnaval power of England lasted till the news of the peace reached him on\r\nthe 29th June 1783. During those seventeen months he fought the five\r\nactions on which the French dwell with pride, for they constitute the\r\nmost glorious passage in the history of their navy. It is true that\r\nhe took no English ship in any of them and that he failed to achieve\r\nthe object he fought for. Yet we cannot but see the greatness of the\r\nman. “Brave Suffren must return from Hyder Ally and the Indian Waters;\r\nwith small results; yet with great glory for six _non defeats_; which\r\nindeed, with such seconding as he had, one may reckon heroic.” Carlyle\r\nincludes Porto Praya to make the tale of six, and he says the final\r\nword of any just judgment on “the Bailli.” If ever a man lived who\r\njustified Napoleon’s maxim that war is an affair not of men but of a\r\nman, it was he. It was by his personal merit that his squadron came to\r\nthe very verge of winning a triumphant success. That he failed was due\r\nto the fact that the French Navy, in spite of the tardy efforts of the\r\nministers of Louis XVI., was honeycombed by the intellectual and moral\r\nvices which were bringing France to the great Revolution—corruption,\r\nself-seeking, acrid class insolence, and skinless, morbid vanity. On\r\nits way from the islands the squadron fell in with and captured the\r\nEnglish =Hannibal=, 50. One of her officers was placed as a prisoner on\r\nparole in the mess of the French _Bizarre_. An officer of the regiment\r\nof Austrasie, which was being carried by the squadron to aid Hyder Ali,\r\nthe Chevalier de Mautort, says in his Memoirs that this officer was a\r\ncheerful young gentleman who did not speak four words of French, but\r\nmade himself very pleasant. Withal he showed his professional zeal by\r\nkeeping an alert watch on all that went on about him, and, adds the\r\nFrenchman, he cannot have been greatly impressed by the way our work\r\nwas done. A man can gain no higher praise than this, that he raised\r\nthe institution he belonged to above itself—and so much Suffren did.\r\nThe English force opposed to him was to show how the virtues of an\r\ninstitution can atone for the deficiencies of a commonplace chief and\r\nbaffle the genius of an enemy. When the great captain is found in\r\ncommand of the superior force, then we have the victories of Nelson.\r\n\r\nThe object of the French officer was to obtain such a position on the\r\ncoast of Coromandel as would strengthen the hands of his Government\r\nwhen the time came to make peace. In order to do this, he aimed first\r\nat destroying the squadron of Hughes, then at obtaining possession of\r\na port or ports where he could land men, both those he had with him\r\nand those whom he knew to be coming from Europe to aid Hyder Ali, and\r\nalso to refit his own ships. On the 13th February 1782 he appeared off\r\nMadras with twelve sail of the line—the eleven which had come from\r\nthe Île de France, and the =Hannibal= taken from the English, and now\r\nturned into a French warship. Hughes was at anchor there with nine sail\r\nof the line. To have attacked him at anchor would have been dangerous\r\nand unnecessary, since the departure of the French to the south, as if\r\nto attack Trincomalee, would be sure to draw the English admiral out.\r\n\r\nSuffren acted on that calculation with success. He stood to the south,\r\nand was followed by Hughes. One of the subordinate French captains\r\nin charge of the convoy of transports and prizes accompanying the\r\nFrench fleet was so careless as to allow them to fall to leeward of\r\nthe battleships, where they were between Suffren and Hughes. Six of\r\nthem, including one which carried 300 soldiers, were captured. On the\r\n17th February Suffren, who was to windward of the English squadron,\r\nwhich was heading to the south, bore down on it from N.E. He led his\r\nsquadron and ranged along the weather-side of the English till he\r\nreached the fifth ship. It was his wish and his order that those of his\r\nvessels which could not find room on the windward side of their enemy\r\nshould pass to leeward, and so put him between two fires. He was ill\r\nobeyed. Only two of his rear ships did as they ought, and several never\r\ncame into action. Yet he did carry out a concentration of superior\r\non inferior numbers. The fifth English vessel which he engaged was\r\nthe =Superb=, 74, Hughes’ flagship. She and the ships astern of her\r\nsuffered severely. The last ship in the English line, the =Exeter=, 64,\r\ncarrying the broad pennant of Commodore King, was cut to pieces. The\r\nconduct of the commodore partly explains why the good management of\r\nSuffren was balked of its reward. He had been covered by the blood of\r\nhis flag-captain, Reynolds, who was cut in two by a cannon-shot at his\r\nside. His ship was battered by two enemies, and a third appeared to be\r\nabout to join them. One of his officers asked him what was to be done.\r\n“There is nothing to be done,” said King, “but to fight till she sink.”\r\nThe rest of the explanation must be sought in the fact that, as Suffren\r\ntold the Minister of Marine in a moment of bitterness, the French\r\nofficers who had spent years in the Cythera of the Île de France,\r\nleading idle, self-indulgent lives ashore, and intent on trading\r\nventures called “la pacotille” (peddling), were neither officers nor\r\nseamen. Finding that he was not backed up as he should have been,\r\nSuffren drew off at dark. He had to some extent attained his object.\r\nThe =Superb= and the =Exeter= were so badly mauled that Hughes went off\r\nbefore the northerly wind then blowing to refit at Trincomalee. While\r\nhe was absent, Suffren went to Porto Novo to establish relations with\r\nHyder Ali on the 21st February, and on the 4th April the troops he had\r\nlanded took Cuddalore. This is a passage in naval history which should\r\nbe remembered when we hear of the necessity for naval bases. It shows\r\nthat a victorious fleet will soon supply itself with a base.\r\n\r\nWhile Suffren was making himself master of Cuddalore, Hughes was\r\nendeavouring to secure the safety of Trincomalee. He left it on the 4th\r\nMarch, came to Madras, when he was reinforced by two of the line, and\r\nwent back with soldiers and stores. Suffren having put matters on as\r\ngood a footing as he could at Cuddalore, followed Hughes to Ceylon. On\r\nthe 12th April, the date on which Rodney defeated Grasse in the West\r\nIndies, another battle was fought in the east. Again Suffren attacked,\r\nand this time, more as it seems by accident than from good management,\r\nhe concentrated a superior force on an inferior, falling with three\r\nvessels on the =Superb=, and the ship ahead of her, the =Monmouth=, 64.\r\nBoth were severely cut up, but as on the former occasion several of the\r\nFrench captains were shy or awkward. The fleets separated without loss\r\nof a ship on either side, and anchored near one another on the coast\r\nof Ceylon. Suffren was first at sea on the 17th, and offered battle on\r\nthe 19th; but Hughes declined. Then the Frenchman went to Batticaloa to\r\nrefit, and thence back to the Coromandel coast. Hughes, after stopping\r\nat Trincomalee, followed him. The two continued watching and waiting\r\nan opportunity till the 6th July, when Hughes, for the first and\r\nlast time, attacked his opponent. The battle, which was fought near\r\nNegapatam, was notable for the fact that it may be said to have been\r\nblown out by a sudden shift of the wind, which headed both fleets,\r\nand threw them into complete confusion. In the disorder of the close\r\nthe French _Sévère_ was surrounded by English ships, and her captain,\r\nM. de Cillart, ordered his flag to be struck. It was hoisted again by\r\nhis subordinates, and the _Sévère_ renewed her fire. The incident was\r\nan ugly one, and led to an angry correspondence between the admirals.\r\nCillart was suspended by Suffren, and was afterwards dismissed the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nAfter the action in July, Hughes went to Madras. He was expecting\r\nreinforcements, and so was Suffren. But the Frenchman showed greater\r\nalertness. On the 21st August he was off Batticaloa, where he met\r\nhis reinforcements, and on the 25th he attacked Trincomalee, which\r\nsurrendered on the 31st. Hughes, who had not left Madras till the\r\n20th, did not appear off Trincomalee till the 3rd September. Another\r\nengagement followed, Suffren attacking from windward and Hughes edging\r\naway. Again he was ill supported, and his irritation provoked him into\r\nan explosion of hot Southern rage. Impatience with the pottering of his\r\ncaptains led him to plunge into action in a disorderly way, which gave\r\nHughes an advantage. In spite of that, and though a shift of the wind\r\ntransferred the weather-gage from the French to the English officer,\r\nand though our naval historians speak currently of the defeat of\r\nSuffren, it is certain that Hughes did not feel sufficiently victorious\r\nto pursue when his opponent drew off.\r\n\r\nThe two fleets withdrew to their respective bases—Hughes to Madras,\r\nand Suffren to Trincomalee. He lost one of his 74’s when entering the\r\nharbour—the _Orient_—by the bad seamanship of her captain, and another\r\nwhen he returned to Cuddalore. The change of the monsoon suspended\r\noperations for a time. Hughes having lost the excellent harbour of\r\nTrincomalee, could not remain on the east coast, and therefore had to\r\ngo round to Bombay through storms which damaged his ships severely. He\r\nmissed Sir Richard Bickerton, who was coming out with stores, and who\r\nhad a stormy passage in and out of the Bay of Bengal, as he sought,\r\nand followed, his superior to Bombay. If Suffren’s captains had had\r\ntheir wish, and if the Minister in Paris had been obeyed, the French\r\nsquadron would have returned to its Cythera. But “the Bailli” knew that\r\nif he returned to the islands, Hughes would be able to forestall him in\r\nthe Bay, when the monsoon changed again. He took the responsibility of\r\nremaining where he was, and wintered at Achin, in Sumatra, which was\r\nunder the supremacy, if not actually in the possession, of the Dutch\r\nhis allies. Therefore he was on the scene of operations two months\r\nbefore Hughes could come round from Bombay.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Ceylon he met Bussy, a once famous fighter in India,\r\nwho had been sent from Europe to take the general command in the East,\r\nwith troops. The reinforcements provided for Suffren were generally\r\nsent in small bodies, and were frequently intercepted. But his fleet\r\nhad now been raised to fifteen sail, and was the mainstay of the\r\nenemies of the Company. Hyder Ali was dead, but his son Tippoo Sultan\r\ncontinued the war, though it was going against him. The struggle\r\nconcentrated around Cuddalore, where Bussy was assailed by a superior\r\narmy. Hughes, whose fleet had now been brought up to eighteen sail,\r\nco-operated with the besieging army. His superiority in number of ships\r\nwas discounted by the ill-health of his crews, which were very sickly.\r\nThe last encounter between the old opponents took place on the 20th\r\nJune, and was of the commonplace eighteenth-century order—save for two\r\ndetails. The French fleet of fifteen sail attacked the British fleet\r\nof eighteen from windward—and it was the British fleet which retired.\r\nThen Suffren had received an order from home—an order inspired by the\r\ncapture of the Comte de Grasse in the battle of Dominica—to hoist his\r\nflag in a frigate and direct his line from outside. He obeyed, and it\r\nperhaps throws some light on the question whether the proper place for\r\nan admiral is in his line, where he can set an example, or outside of\r\nit, where he can see and direct the whole, that on this occasion the\r\nFrench fleet came into action in far better order than in previous\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\nThe retreat of Hughes left the army besieging Cuddalore in a dangerous\r\nposition. It depended on transport by sea for most of its provisions,\r\nand might have been driven to a disastrous retreat. But at this moment\r\nthe news that the preliminaries of peace had been signed in Europe on\r\nthe 20th January reached India, and was communicated to Suffren on\r\nthe 29th June. He returned to Europe to die of apoplexy in 1788, and\r\nwhen next the French and English fleets met, the outbreak of the great\r\nRevolution had made another world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STAGE OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n The authorities for the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars are\r\n     numerous. An English writer will naturally give the first place\r\n     in the list to _The Naval History of Great Britain_, by William\r\n     James, a trustworthy, laborious, and indispensable, but dry and\r\n     too often unintelligent chronicle, which covers the whole story\r\n     from 1793 to 1815. The _Naval Chronology_ of Isaac Schomberg\r\n     ends at the Peace of 1801. Captain Mahan’s _Influence of Sea\r\n     Power upon the French Revolution and Empire_ is a survey of\r\n     the principles rather than the mere events of the whole war.\r\n     On the French side we have Troude, _Batailles navales de la\r\n     France_, the chronology quoted for earlier chapters; Chevalier,\r\n     _Histoire de la Marine française sous la première République_,\r\n     a history up to 1799; Rouvier, _Marins français sous la\r\n     République_; Moulin, _Les Marins de la République_; Lecène,\r\n     _Marins de la République et de l’Empire_. The _Naval Chronicle_\r\n     (1799-1818) did not begin with the war, but it looks back on\r\n     events antecedent to its own beginning. Brenton’s _Naval History\r\n     of Great Britain from 1783 to 1836_, first published in 1823\r\n     and recast in 1837, professes to be a general history, but is\r\n     chiefly valuable for the writer’s personal reminiscences and\r\n     the traditions of the service which he repeats. An excellent\r\n     study of one of the most important episodes of the early years\r\n     of the war is Cottin, _Toulon et les Anglais en 1793_. For the\r\n     battle of the 1st of June the main authority now is Rear-Admiral\r\n     Sturges Jackson’s _Logs of the Great Sea Fights 1794-1805_,\r\n     edited for the Navy Record Society. Sir N. H. Nicholas’ _Letters\r\n     and Despatches of Lord Nelson_ is a mine of information from the\r\n     operations at Toulon till 1805. Biographies of officers first\r\n     become abundant at this period. Those which are of most value\r\n     for the opening stage of the war are:—Burrows’ _Howe_, Ross’s\r\n     _Saumarez_, Osler’s _Exmouth_, Tucker’s _St. Vincent_, Lady\r\n     Bourchier’s _Codrington_; and for the operations in the West\r\n     Indies, Collier Willyams’ special work on the subject, which is\r\n     the basis of the account given by Bryan Edwards in his _History\r\n     of the West Indies_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen England was dragged into the war already raging between France\r\nand the German powers, against the wish of her rulers, and by the\r\ndeliberate action of the revolutionary authorities in Paris on the\r\n1st February 1793, she came in as the ally of all Central and Western\r\nEurope. By the spring of 1795 she was left to fight single-handed on\r\nthe sea. The French armies had overrun Holland in January of that\r\nyear. Prussia, hampered by an empty treasury and distracted by her\r\nanxiety to secure a share in the third partition of Poland, made peace\r\nat Bâle on the 5th April. Spain, weak, exhausted, and ill governed, was\r\neager for peace. France, which had no cause to fear her and was anxious\r\nto withdraw the troops serving on the Pyrenean frontier, to reinforce\r\nthe armies in Italy, on the Rhine, and in the Low Countries, gave her\r\nfavourable terms. A treaty of peace, which was the preliminary to a\r\ntreaty of alliance, was signed, also at Bâle, on the 22nd July. From\r\nthe 1st February 1793 to the Franco-Spanish treaty of Bâle, 22nd July\r\n1795, makes the first period of a war which was destined to last, with\r\ntwo brief intervals, for another twenty years. It was on both sides a\r\nstruggle for existence. Revolutionary France fought to secure her new\r\nsocial order. To protect the gains of the Revolution, she strove to\r\nsecure her “natural limits”—the Pyrenees, the Alps, the line of the\r\nRhine. To guard herself against the hostility which this increase of\r\npower was sure to arouse in her neighbours, she had to gain possession\r\nof advanced guards and outlying fortresses to cover her new frontier,\r\nto subjugate Holland, and keep Spain in a dependence which must also\r\ninclude Portugal. But with the coast of Europe and its resources,\r\nfrom the Texel to the Maritime Alps, in the possession of France, the\r\nposition of England would have been one of extreme danger. Therefore,\r\nin order that she herself might be safe, she had to endeavour to force\r\nFrance back into her old limits, and since France was resolved to\r\nsecure her “natural limits” for her own security, she was committed to\r\nan endeavour to subjugate England. The fight could not end till one\r\nside was fairly beaten, and France was not vanquished, and shut once\r\nmore within her frontier of 1790, till the Peace of Paris of the 20th\r\nNovember 1815 was signed. All Europe had to combine to bind her; for\r\nthe causes which drove her to dominate Holland and Spain, as a defence\r\nagainst England, operated to compel her to seek other outworks and\r\nsubdue other possible assailants beyond the Rhine and the Maritime\r\nAlps. In this mighty struggle of forces and principles it was the\r\npart of England to dominate the sea. Her strength on the sea made her\r\nthe one power whom the French armies could not strike to the heart.\r\nTherefore she was the permanent enemy of France, the constant ally\r\nof her foes, and in the end the controlling member of the European\r\nCoalition which dictated the Treaty of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe part which England played was to herself glorious and profitable,\r\nand to Europe advantageous. It was also arduous. But the student of\r\nthe history of the time, if he approaches the subject with a just\r\ndetermination to see it in a dry light and to judge by the evidence,\r\nmust soon be convinced that if the nation was called upon to make great\r\nefforts and endure much, the burden was not imposed on it by the naval\r\nforces of its enemy. If we are to realise the real character of the\r\ntask and estimate the true merit of the performance, we must first come\r\nto a sound understanding of the condition of the French fleet, which\r\nwas our one serious opponent. The other navies thrown or dragged into\r\nthe conflict served to do little more—if we put aside the gallant fight\r\nof the Dutch at Camperdown—than to multiply the number of posts which\r\nrequired to be watched, and so to add further severity to the already\r\ncruel strain of blockade.\r\n\r\nWhen our squadrons began to get to sea in the summer of 1793, they\r\nfound in front of them an enemy disorganised by four years of\r\nadministrative destruction and attempted reconstruction, and morally\r\nruined by four years of progressive anarchy.[1] The _ordonnance_ of\r\nLouis XIV. had never been honestly carried out. The _classes_ had been\r\ncruelly worked. The compensations promised to the seafaring population\r\nhad never been given. Bad food, no pay, and nakedness were the lot\r\nof the sailors in the king’s ships. Therefore they hated the king’s\r\nservice, and fled from it when they could. The State punished them by\r\nbilleting soldiers on their families, and the outrages perpetrated by\r\nthese men on the women and girls were notorious. It has been already\r\nsaid that the French officers of the regular, or grand, corps were\r\nnobles. Being nobles, they insisted on equality among themselves to\r\nthe injury of discipline, and were perfectly insolent to all men who\r\nwere not of their own class. None of the many ignorant things said\r\nof the French Revolution is more ignorant than the assertion that it\r\ngave Frenchmen their love of equality. What it did was to declare\r\nthat all Frenchmen should be equal, and that there should be an end\r\nof the division of the people into nobles above, who were equal among\r\nthemselves, and the _roture_, or non-noble, below, who also were equal\r\namong themselves. As the grand corps had never been sufficiently\r\nnumerous to officer the fleet on a war footing, it had been found\r\nnecessary to employ supplementary officers drawn from the merchant\r\nservice. These men, who were known as the “blue officers,” because\r\ntheir uniform had not the red facings and knee-breeches of the grand\r\ncorps, were not allowed to reach the higher ranks. They had to endure\r\nmuch impertinence.\r\n\r\nIt follows that no part of the French nation was better prepared to\r\njoin the revolt against class privilege and in the demand for universal\r\nsocial equality than the sailors. A memory of long suffering and of\r\nbitter wrong rankled among the crews. Ulcerated pride, and the vanity\r\nwhich is peculiarly sensitive in the Frenchman and is easily driven to\r\nferocity by wounds, exasperated the non-noble officers, and made them\r\nthe natural leaders of revolt. In front of these elements of rebellion\r\nwere the officers of the grand corps, very good sort of gentlemen\r\nindividually in most cases, but even at their best quite unable to help\r\nshowing their inbred hereditary conviction that they were of a finer\r\nclay than their comrades who were not of their class. It is a belief\r\nwhich can be shown with the most irritating insolence by an assumption\r\nof exact politeness.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 the Government had acknowledged the necessity for a change.\r\nThe Marquis de Castries, then Minister of Marine, simplified the old\r\nranks, and abolished the _Gardes de la marine_. He proposed to recruit\r\nthe corps of officers in future by _élèves de la marine_, who might be\r\nof non-noble birth. But while breaking down the old exclusive rule,\r\nhe still made a distinction. _Élèves_ who came from the schools of\r\nVannes and Alais, which were confined to the nobles, could become\r\nlieutenants at once. All other _élèves_ had to pass through a rank\r\nof sub-lieutenant, and were therefore put at a disadvantage from the\r\nbeginning. It was an excellent example of the kind of concession which\r\nprovokes, and does not satisfy. When, in 1789, the king summoned the\r\nStates General, he made a tacit confession that the absolute monarchy\r\nhad brought France to financial ruin and administrative collapse, and\r\ncould itself find no remedy. In fact, the monarchy abdicated, and the\r\nspontaneous anarchy of the Revolution broke out. It raged with extreme\r\nviolence in the dockyards and the fleet. As early as March 1789 an\r\noutbreak, immediately provoked by the sufferings of the workmen and\r\nthe sailors from the scarcity of that severe winter and bad harvest\r\nof 1788, took place at Toulon. Count d’Albert de Rions, _commandant\r\nde la marine_, was attacked, and nearly murdered. After the fall of\r\nthe Bastille on the 14th July 1789, disorders broke out at Brest,\r\nand spread to Rochefort and L’Orient. The details need not be given\r\nhere. The essential in all of them was that the workmen and sailors\r\nunderstood liberty and equality to mean that they were not to be\r\nordered about by their old masters; that the stronger had the right to\r\ncommand, and that the nation was now the stronger; that the privileged\r\ncorps were the natural enemies of the nation. The French Navy was well\r\nrepresented in the States General, or National Assembly, and many\r\ndebates on it took place. In April 1790 a scheme of reorganisation\r\nwas drawn up. It was in the main a sound one, and did in fact lay\r\nthe foundation of the modern French Navy. But its details may be\r\nomitted, since years were to pass before it could even begin to be\r\napplied. The essential of the case here is that the General Assembly\r\nhad to begin by reorganising the existing corps of officers; that it\r\nwas in fear of a reaction and counter-revolution; that it distrusted\r\nthe _civisme_, or loyalty to the Revolution, of the noble officers;\r\nthat it dared not check the zeal of the workmen of the dockyards and\r\nthe sailors; and when that zeal took, as it did from the first, the\r\nform of mutinous attacks on the Grand Corps, the Assembly did not\r\nventure to punish offenders who were its eager partisans. After each\r\nexplosion of violence, it ordered an inquiry, and then decided that\r\neverybody concerned had acted from a good motive, including the unhappy\r\nofficers who had been threatened with “the lantern,”—that is to say,\r\nthe halter,—mobbed, kicked, and thrown into prison. The position of\r\nthese officers became intolerable. The majority fled abroad, where\r\nthey formed a regiment, in the emigrant army of Condé. It has been\r\ncalculated that three-fourths of the old corps were lost to France.\r\nThose who remained included a few who were convinced partisans of\r\nthe Revolution; others remained because their poverty gave them no\r\nmeans of escape. Admiral Trogoff de Kerlessi, the Breton noble who\r\nsurrendered the ships at Toulon to Lord Hood in 1793, was one of these.\r\nBut loyal or not loyal to the Revolution, they were alike oppressed and\r\ndistrusted. The place of the emigrants was taken by men whose chief\r\nmerit came to be their _civisme_, which was manifested by blatant\r\npot-house oratory, self-assertion, and intrigue. The evil which the\r\nanarchy of 1789-93 did to the French fleet was not made good till the\r\nfall of the Empire. The inward and spiritual forces of discipline\r\nwere killed. Even under the emperor, orders on such vital things as\r\nthe gunnery drill of the crews were constantly met with outward and\r\nvisible signs of neglect and disobedience. Perhaps because the best\r\nof the French nation does not naturally tend to the sea, it is also\r\nan undeniable fact that the French Navy produced no equivalent for\r\nthe multitude of capable men from the ranks, and the non-commissioned\r\nofficers, who replaced the emigrant aristocratic officers in the army.\r\nThey had as good an opportunity on the water as on the land, but they\r\ndid not come.\r\n\r\nThe old monarchy had left the Revolution the materials of a noble\r\nfleet. The calculation of James in his _Naval History_ is allowed to be\r\nsound. He puts the relative strength of the French and English navies\r\nin line-of-battle ships at\r\n\r\n +---------+---------+---------+-------------+\r\n |         | Number  |  Number |  Aggregate  |\r\n |         |of Ships | of Guns.| Broadsides. |\r\n +---------+---------+---------+-------------+\r\n | English |   115   |   8718  |   88,957    |\r\n | French  |    75   |   6002  |   23,057    |\r\n +---------+---------+---------+-------------+\r\n\r\nThe proportion in frigates was nearly two to one in our favour.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Navy was suffering from internal evils which broke out in\r\n1797, but none of them were fatal, or beyond comparatively easy\r\ncure. In the interval between the Peace of 1783 and February 1793\r\nthree powerful fleets had been commissioned—in 1786, in consequence\r\nof the disturbed state of Holland; in 1790, on the prospect of a war\r\nwith Spain—the Spanish armament; and in 1791, when intervention in\r\nthe East appeared to be likely to become necessary. No fighting had\r\nensued, but the efficiency of the dockyards had been tested. There was\r\nnothing to delay the vigorous use of the fleet in February 1793 except\r\nthe old-standing difficulty always found in passing suddenly from a\r\nreduced peace establishment to a war footing, when the crews had to be\r\ncollected by the press. It was, however, so serious that though Lord\r\nHowe, who was appointed to command the Channel fleet, “kissed hands” at\r\ncourt on his appointment on the 6th February, he did not leave London\r\ntill the 27th May, and did not sail from St. Helens till the 14th July.\r\nAn interval of six months, therefore, passed between the declaration of\r\nwar and the appearance in home waters of the fleet which was to protect\r\nour shores. Lord Howe’s command was indeed not the first to be ready\r\nfor service. France was to be attacked at three points—in the Channel,\r\nin the Mediterranean, and in the West Indies. The squadron appointed\r\nfor the West Indies, and commanded by Sir John Jervis, was not able\r\nto sail till the very close of the year; but the Mediterranean fleet,\r\nunder Lord Hood, sailed in detachments during April and May.\r\n\r\nThat it was safe to send Hood with his twenty sail of the line to the\r\nMediterranean before the home fleet was ready is a signal proof that\r\nthe Government felt it could rely on the disorganisation of the enemy\r\nto serve as our defence for a time. France had been at war since the\r\nprevious year, and the contending portions of Girondins and Jacobins\r\nin Paris had alike been deliberately provoking a war with England.\r\nIf they had been wise, they would have had a part at least of their\r\nfleet in a condition to act at once. But if wisdom can be attributed\r\nto the dominant elements in the National Assembly, the praise can be\r\ngiven only on the ground that a universal war was needed to confirm\r\nthe triumph of the revolutionary parties. The ruin of their finances\r\nand the whirlwind of the social Revolution precluded all possibility\r\nof immediate effective action at sea. If we look only to the number\r\nof ships in commission and their distribution, France was in fairly\r\ngood position to strike at once. There were three sail of the line and\r\nseven frigates at San Domingo, five frigates at Martinique, and two\r\nsloops at Cayenne. The Mediterranean fleet, recently reinforced from\r\nthe Channel, consisted of eighteen sail of the line, sixteen frigates,\r\nand a number of small craft. In the Channel and on the Atlantic coast\r\nthere were seven ships of the line at Brest, one at Cherbourg, three\r\nat the isle of Aix, together with seven frigates and other small\r\nvessels. The Vendéens were in arms for the king, and the authorities\r\nat Paris were well aware of the necessity for cutting them off from\r\nforeign support. On the 8th March, Admiral Morard de Galle, an officer\r\nof the old grand corps, was ordered to sea to cruise on the coast\r\nwith three sail of the line. Bad weather drove him back to port, or\r\nserved as an excuse for his return with his ill-appointed and mutinous\r\nships. With feverish energy, and perhaps in the sincere though frantic\r\nbelief that revolutionary energy would atone for the want of other\r\nelements of strength, the National Assembly commissioned fresh vessels,\r\ndrove them to sea, and collected a squadron in Quiberon Bay under\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse. Morard de Galle took command of the whole on the 22nd\r\nMay, seven days before Howe left London. By the 1st August he had with\r\nhim nineteen sail of the line—four less than left St. Helens with Howe\r\non the 14th July.\r\n\r\nThe operations in the Channel till the close of 1793 are without\r\ninterest. Howe sighted the French hull down off Belleisle on the 31st\r\nJuly. Calms, squalls, and thick weather, the shyness of the enemy and\r\nthe rawness of his own force, hastily manned and commanded by officers\r\ngrown somewhat rusty in peace, combined to prevent an engagement.\r\nTill the close of the year the English admiral was either cruising\r\nin search of the enemy, and to protect trade, or was coming back to\r\nTorbay with sprung masts and split topsails to refit, and for stores.\r\nIn November the French squadron of Vanstabel escaped his pursuit by\r\nsheer superiority of sailing due to the finer lines of their hulls and\r\nthe more scientific cut of their sails. Morard de Galle did not dare\r\nto force an engagement. That he was outnumbered was a sound reason\r\nfor avoiding battle. And he had still better cause in the state of his\r\ncrews. Unpaid, unclothed, fed on insufficient rations of salted meat\r\nonly, and infested by scurvy, they had good cause for discontent. A\r\nworse cause of weakness than even these paralysed him. The crews were\r\nin the full fever of revolutionary disorder, and had acquired a settled\r\nhabit of mutiny. They were distrustful of the _civisme_ of their\r\nadmiral, and maddened by the fear of treason. After many clamours,\r\nthey forced their admiral to return to Brest on the 28th of September.\r\nThe delegate of the National Assembly, Tréhouart, who accompanied\r\nthe fleet, recognised the necessity for the return; but as usual the\r\nblame was laid on the want of _civisme_ of the chiefs. Morard de Galle\r\nwas dismissed and imprisoned. Several captains were sent before the\r\nrevolutionary tribunal, and most of them were put to death.\r\n\r\nWhile the French were dismissing and beheading their officers, public\r\nopinion in England as represented by the Press, was condemning Howe. He\r\nwas violently abused in the blackguard newspaper style of the time, and\r\nwas ridiculed in highly coloured caricatures. One by Isaac Cruikshank\r\nshows “How a great admiral, with a great fleet, went a great way, was\r\nlost a great while, saw a great sight, and then came home for a little\r\nwater.” The admiral chants piteously—\r\n\r\n    “Oh Lord when I get to Torbay,\r\n    How folks will gape and stare;\r\n    Are non come back the Lord knows how\r\n    And been the Lord knows where.”\r\n\r\nAnother, drawn with the genius of Gillray, and inspired by all his\r\nbrutality of rancour, shows Howe blinded by a shower of gold coins, and\r\nstanding on a gold shell. He is saying, “Zounds! the damned hailstones\r\nhinder one from doing one’s duty. I cannot see out of my eyes for them.\r\nOh it was just such another cursed peppering as this, that I fell in\r\nwith on the coast of America in the last war, and a deuce of a thing\r\nit is, that whenever I am just going to play the devil I am either\r\nhindered by these confounded French storms, or else loose (_sic_) my\r\nway in a fog.”\r\n\r\nHere we have the English counterpart of the French popular fury which\r\ndoubted the _civisme_ of Morard de Galle and suspected him of treason.\r\nBut the Government of England was strong, and upheld its admiral.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary operations in the Mediterranean began by a success\r\nwhich seemed to promise a speedy end of the war. By the middle of\r\nJuly Hood was on the coast of Provence with twenty-one sail of the\r\nline. He met the Spanish fleet at sea near to Iviça on the 6th, and\r\nfound it in a miserably inefficient state. But the French fleet at\r\nToulon was in a still worse condition than the Brest fleet. It had\r\nnot dared to tackle even the feeble Spaniards. When orders were given\r\nto go to sea, the crews refused, saying that they were to be sold by\r\ntreason, and would not sail in order to reach a foreign prison. The\r\nAdmiral Trogoff de Kerlessi was a Royalist, whom his poverty alone\r\nhad prevented from following other officers of his opinions into the\r\nemigration. The Royalists were strong in the south of France, though\r\ndivided among themselves into those who wished the king to govern with\r\nthe constitution of 1791, and those who aimed at the restoration of the\r\nabsolute monarchy. The country was in open opposition to the Jacobin\r\nGovernment at Paris, and was bubbling with intrigue. Hood established a\r\ncommunication with the Toulonese Royalists through a Lieutenant Cooke,\r\nwho was sent in on the pretext that he came to arrange an exchange\r\nof prisoners. Cooke, who has been erroneously described as a son of\r\nthe discoverer, was afterwards killed as captain of the =Sybille= in\r\nher action with the _Forte_. On the 28th August the Toulonese were\r\nterrified by hearing that the Jacobin army which had just destroyed\r\nLyons had occupied Marseilles, and was about to march on their own\r\ntown. In the panic which the news caused, the Royalists combined to\r\nsurrender the town, with dockyard and ships, to the English admiral,\r\nwho was in co-operation with the Spanish fleet of Don Juan de Lángara,\r\nthe officer who had been defeated and taken prisoner by Rodney in the\r\nrelief of Gibraltar in 1780. In the course of the 28th and 29th they\r\ntook possession. The sailors from Brest who were Jacobin in sympathy\r\nand the Jacobins in the town were over-awed.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Toulon seemed to promise a speedy counter revolution\r\nin at any rate the south of France, or failing that, then the entire\r\nruin of the French naval power in the Mediterranean by the permanent\r\nretention of the port. Both hopes were disappointed. Political causes\r\nwhich must be passed over here weakened the allies and their French\r\nfriends. Toulon is a difficult town to defend on the land side. No\r\nsufficient force for the purpose could be collected by the allies.\r\nThe Austrians would send no soldiers. The Spaniards who were sent\r\nproved untrustworthy. The Neapolitans, who came in some numbers, were\r\nworthless. The only solid elements in the garrison, the Piedmontese\r\nand the English soldiers, were too few. When, therefore, the Jacobin\r\narmy was put under the command of Dugommier, an excellent officer,\r\nand its artillery was directed by Napoleon Bonaparte, who here first\r\ncame conspicuously forward, it soon gained command of high ground from\r\nwhich it could bombard the harbour and render the anchorage untenable.\r\nOn the 19th December Toulon was evacuated. The evacuation, which was\r\ncomplicated by the necessity for bringing away thousands of French\r\nrefugees, was a scene of horror, and the preliminary to other scenes of\r\nhorror when the Jacobins gained possession and took vengeance on their\r\ncountrymen. Hood brought away as many of the French ships and as much\r\nof the naval stores as he could, and endeavoured to destroy the rest by\r\nfire. The task of destruction was entrusted to Captain Sidney Smith,\r\nwho had joined the fleet as a volunteer in a small vessel purchased and\r\narmed by himself in the Levant. Smith, a very vapouring, but also a\r\nvery stirring and quick-witted man, did his best, and made the most of\r\nwhat he did in his reports. The ill-will of the Spaniards, who perhaps\r\nwished to preserve a French naval force as a counterbalance to the\r\nEnglish, and the rapid advance of the French, prevented the destruction\r\nfrom being thorough. Yet the allies carried off four sail of the line\r\nand burnt nine. They burnt fifteen frigates and carried off five. The\r\nEnglish troops who might have prevented the retaking of Toulon were\r\nin Flanders under the Duke of York, or were about to sail to the West\r\nIndies in the expedition convoyed by Jervis, and commanded by Sir\r\nCharles Grey.\r\n\r\nThe war in the West Indies is one of the most instructive and\r\ninteresting parts of the great revolutionary struggle. It was\r\nonly begun by the capture of Martinique in 1794, and will be most\r\nconveniently dealt with as a whole, and together with the ancillary\r\nservices of the navy. For the present I think it most convenient\r\nonly to note that in April Santa Lucia and Guadaloupe, together with\r\nsome smaller posts, were occupied. In June the arrival of French\r\nreinforcements at Guadaloupe gave an entirely new character to the war\r\nin this region. Only a few days before this expedition intervened,\r\nthere had been fought in European waters the great battle which was\r\nto decide whether England was or was not to be free to continue her\r\nconquests in distant seas.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this expedition had sailed from Rochefort on the 25th\r\nApril, unseen by British look-out ships, and had reached the West\r\nIndies before warning was given to Sir John Jervis, would seem to\r\nindicate some want of vigilance in the English blockading squadrons\r\nand look-out ships. The question whether the watch maintained on the\r\nFrench ports in the early stages of the war was well conducted has\r\nbeen much debated. Every reader of naval controversy has heard of the\r\nrespective merits of the kind of blockade preferred by Howe, and the\r\ncourse followed by Jervis when he had become Earl St. Vincent and was\r\nin command in the Channel. Under St. Vincent the blockading fleet was\r\nexpected to remain outside the enemy’s port in all seasons, save when\r\nthe westerly gales drove the heavy ships to take refuge at Torquay,\r\nfrom whence they could return rapidly to their station when the wind\r\nshifted. During the absence of the heavy ships an inshore squadron of\r\npicked vessels remained at anchor on the French coast just outside of\r\nthe range of French guns. Howe preferred to keep his ships at anchor in\r\nEnglish ports, leaving frigates to watch the enemy, and report if they\r\ncame to sea. The method of St. Vincent, which had been adopted before\r\nhim by Hawke, imposed a very severe strain on both men and ships.\r\nHowe’s course was the milder, the more endurable to officers and crews.\r\nBut it was open to the criticism that it allowed the enemy too good a\r\nchance of getting to sea unobserved, when it naturally followed that\r\nthere was a difficulty in discovering what course he had taken, and in\r\nbringing him to action. On that ground alone St. Vincent’s blockade\r\nmust be judged to be superior, and it had the further advantage that\r\nit tended to keep the fleet in better training though at a cruel cost\r\nto humanity. Yet we need not forget that even when St. Vincent’s\r\nrules were most strictly enforced, individual French ships and small\r\nsquadrons did get to sea, while the torpor of their main fleet was\r\ndeliberately enforced by the Government which had renounced the policy\r\nof meeting the English fleets in battle, and fitted out its own with\r\nno more aspiring ambition than the wish to impose a burden on England\r\nby forcing her to keep up trying blockades. It would be rash to assert\r\nthat such a French expedition as that of 1794 would not have sailed\r\nsuccessfully at any stage of the war.\r\n\r\nThe course of events in European waters during that year can hardly be\r\nquoted as a case in point against Howe’s method. It is true that he\r\nwintered in home ports, and did not sail from St. Helens till the 2nd\r\nMay; but he was off Brest before the main French fleet was at sea, and\r\nif he did not remain outside that port the reason must be sought in the\r\nnature of the task set him. The French harvest of 1793 had been very\r\nbad, and this failure of the home supply of food was aggravated by the\r\ndisorder of the country, which hampered industry. France was in serious\r\ndanger of famine, and the Government had directed its diplomatic agent\r\nin the United States, M. Genêt, to purchase foodstuffs, hire American\r\nvessels, and send them to Europe in a convoy. On the 24th December\r\n1793, Rear-Admiral Vanstabel sailed from Brest to act as escort to\r\nthe trading-ships, with two sail of the line and four frigates. The\r\nFrench Government had given its cruisers an order to impound all food\r\non its way to England in neutral vessels, and the British Government\r\nhad retaliated by declaring all food designed for the use of Frenchmen\r\nto be contraband of war. When, therefore, Lord Howe sailed from St.\r\nHelens, his orders were to intercept the convoy. The French, who were\r\naware that the British fleet would if possible stop the grain-ships,\r\nhad sent Rear-Admiral Nielly to meet them with five sail of the line,\r\n300 miles to the west of Belleisle. Nielly left Brest on the 10th\r\nApril, the day before Vanstabel left the Chesapeake with his hundred\r\nand twenty grain-ships.\r\n\r\nIt is self-evidently true that if Howe had been outside Brest by the\r\nbeginning of April, Nielly could not have sailed. But the British\r\nGovernment was in some anxiety for its own trade, and Howe was ordered\r\nto take with him nearly a hundred merchant-ships, which could not be\r\ncollected sooner, and to see them clear of the Channel. The whole swarm\r\nof vessels which left the Isle of Wight with him amounted to 148 sail,\r\nof which 49 were men-of-war, and 34 were ships of the line. Howe took\r\nthe convoy to the Lizard, and then sent the merchant-ships on under the\r\nprotection of eight ships of the line. Six of these, under the command\r\nof Rear-Admiral Montagu, were ordered to accompany the convoy to Cape\r\nFinisterre, and then cruise between Cape Ortegal and Belleisle till the\r\n20th, when they were to join the flag off Ushant. Two were to accompany\r\nthe merchant-ships to their destination. Howe with twenty-six sail of\r\nthe line and seven frigates steered for Brest to discover whether the\r\nmain French fleet had put to sea. It was discovered at anchor.\r\n\r\nThis fleet, now commanded by Villaret-Joyeuse, a member of the old\r\nRoyal Navy, and a comparatively young man, was within one of the same\r\nstrength as the English—twenty-five sail of the line. Great exertions\r\nhad been made by the French Government to fit it out thoroughly.\r\nSailors had been brought from Toulon, and the crews were filled up by\r\nlevies of landsmen. Every effort had been made to rouse the patriotism\r\nof the crews and confirm their confidence by eloquent appeals to\r\ntheir emotions. As a security that the officers would be kept up to\r\nthe mark, and also as a precaution against the recurrence of the\r\nmutinous disorders which had disturbed the fleet of Morard de Galle,\r\nthe Government had sent down two delegates with large powers of reward\r\nand punishment—Jean Bon Saint André, and Prieur de la Marne. The name\r\nof Jean Bon was freely used by wits in England as a Turk’s Head, or\r\nchopping-block for satire. They expatiated at large in prose and\r\nverse on his absurdities and cowardice. But Jean Bon was by no means\r\nan absurd man. He had been a sailor in his youth, before he became a\r\nProtestant preacher in his native town, Montauban. In the Convention\r\nhe had been distinguished by Jacobin zeal and a great command of the\r\nwindy rhetoric of the time. But he was neither fool nor coward. At a\r\nlater period he did good service for Napoleon as Prefect at Mayence,\r\nand left the reputation of an honest and able official. His influence\r\nin the fleet was exercised on the side of energy, and his absurdities\r\nwere superficial. If he dictated to the admiral, he had begun by making\r\nthe crews understand that mutiny would no longer be tolerated. That\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse was better obeyed than Morard de Galle had been was\r\nmainly due to the presence of a representative of the dreaded Committee\r\nof Public Safety and to the decision of Jean Bon. The Republican fleet\r\nwhich lay at Brest in 1794 was in truth a better force than France was\r\nable to send to sea later in the war, when the spirit of the crews\r\nhad been damped by defeat, when they had ceased to believe in the\r\npossibility of victory, and when long periods of stagnation in port\r\nhad rendered them awkward and timid. It was indeed far from being\r\nefficient. Most of its captains and officers were merchant seamen\r\nwho had no experience of naval military work. Its crews were largely\r\nlandsmen. The Government was well aware of its want of training, for\r\nthey instructed Villaret-Joyeuse to take the opportunity, afforded by\r\nhis cruise for the protection of the convoy, to drill his men. They\r\nwere to be taught the rudiments of their business at the very moment\r\nwhen they were about to meet an enemy. On the other hand, it must not\r\nbe forgotten that the English officers had not yet reached the level\r\nof skill they attained later. Howe had to complain of the awkwardness\r\nof some of his captains. The proportion of men who were at sea for\r\nthe first time in their lives was large in his fleet also. The “prime\r\nseamen,” impressed for the fleet in 1793, had been largely sent to the\r\nMediterranean or West Indies. There were vessels under his command\r\nwhich counted but a low proportion of men bred to the sea in their\r\ncomplements. No doubt the level of skill was higher in the English than\r\nin the French ships. But the superiority of Howe’s force was not what\r\nthe superiority of the crews of coming years was to be. It was based\r\nless on training than on a better spirit of discipline, and the quality\r\nof its cadastre of officers—commissioned, warrant, and petty. Defoe’s\r\nmaxim that “good officers presently make a good army,” holds true of\r\nfleets, though, no doubt, more time is required to make a man useful\r\nin a ship than to drill a soldier.\r\n\r\nWhen Howe saw the French at anchor on the 5th May he might have judged\r\nit wiser to remain off Brest, so as to prevent them from getting out\r\nto cover the arrival of the convoy. But he could have no security that\r\nthe convoy would make for Brest, and if it had reached the French\r\nports to the south while he was blockading Villaret-Joyeuse, the main\r\npurpose of his cruise would have been lost. He therefore stood to sea\r\nto seek for Vanstabel and his charge on and near the 47th degree of\r\nlatitude—the course which would naturally be followed by merchant ships\r\non their way to Europe. He remained sweeping the trade route without\r\nseeing a sail, till he came off Brest again on the 19th, to which he\r\nreturned since he had ordered Admiral Montagu to meet him off Ushant\r\non the 20th. The weather had been foggy, so foggy that on the 17th the\r\nFrench fleet, on its way out, had passed Howe’s ships close enough to\r\nlet the Frenchmen hear the fog signals struck in the English fleet.\r\nThe watch bell was tolled on the starboard, and a drum beaten on the\r\nport, tack. The English fleet did not detect the neighbourhood of the\r\nenemy, and on the 18th the fleets were out of sight of one another.\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse had left Brest on the 16th, and after so narrowly\r\navoiding a collision, he steered for the west to meet Nielly at his\r\nrendezvous, three hundred miles west of Belleisle. Howe, on the 18th,\r\nwas returning to the east, and on the 19th his frigates reconnoitred\r\nthe anchorage and discovered that Villaret-Joyeuse was at sea. On\r\nthe same day the =Venus= frigate joined him with important news from\r\nMontagu. On the 15th the rear-admiral had fallen in with and captured\r\nthe French corvette, _Maire Guiton_, and several merchant vessels. They\r\nbelonged to an English Newfoundland convoy protected by Captain Thomas\r\nTroubridge in the =Castor= frigate. The =Castor= and the vessels she\r\nwas convoying had all fallen into the hands of Nielly, who had sent\r\nthem off as prizes. Montagu learnt from the Englishmen in the crews\r\nof the recaptured ships, that Nielly was waiting to join Vanstabel.\r\nAs their united force would have outnumbered his, he informed the\r\nadmiral, and asked for reinforcements. Howe, who also knew that\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse was at sea, realised the danger that his detached\r\nsquadron might be overwhelmed, and at once steered to the south-west\r\nto afford it protection. On the 21st he fell in with a number of\r\nDutch merchant vessels, just captured by Villaret-Joyeuse, and retook\r\nthem. From the men on board and the logs of the ships he learnt that\r\nthe French admiral was steering to the west to meet Nielly, and in a\r\ndirection which would carry him away from Montagu, who was therefore\r\nin no danger. The main English fleet went in search of the Frenchman.\r\nMontagu, for his part, came to the rendezvous off Ushant on the 20th,\r\nand, not finding Howe there, returned in a few days to the Channel, an\r\nact of weakness which he and his apologists endeavoured to justify,\r\nbut which had no valid excuse. It was an oversight on the part of Lord\r\nHowe that he did not take measures to call Montagu’s six line-of-battle\r\nships to his flag. If they had been with him in the coming battles the\r\nresult could not well have failed to be more decisive.\r\n\r\nFrom the 21st to the 28th of May, Howe was diligently seeking the\r\nFrench between the 47th and 48th parallels of latitude. On the\r\nmorning of the 28th they were seen directly to the south of him,\r\nand to windward in the brisk south-westerly wind then blowing.\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse, who had been joined by the _Patriote_, 74, from the\r\nsquadron of Nielly, had now exactly the same number of ships as Howe.\r\nWhen the English topsails were first seen by the French they were\r\nsupposed to be perhaps the convoy or the ships of Nielly’s squadron. He\r\ntherefore bore down till he was near enough to recognise the English\r\nfleet, which he did when it was separated from him by a space of ten\r\nmiles. The first duty of the French admiral was to manœuvre to secure\r\nthe safety of the convoy. The more effectual course would have been\r\nto force on a close battle and drive Howe away. Villaret-Joyeuse was\r\nfar too painfully conscious of the defects of his command to take the\r\nbold line which would have commended itself to his old chief, Suffren,\r\nwith whom he had served in the East Indies, but was contrary to the\r\ngeneral tradition of the French Navy. Therefore, like the plover, which\r\nendeavours to draw the intruder away from the place where its nest\r\nis, the French admiral manœuvred to tempt his opponent away from the\r\nroute of the grain-ships. There was in truth little risk that he would\r\nnot be followed, to say nothing of the fact that it was impossible to\r\nknow exactly where Vanstabel would be at a given moment. The wholesome\r\ntradition of our navy was to destroy the fighting force of the enemy.\r\nWhen his opponent was in front Howe fixed upon him. The operations of\r\nthe following five days were performed in the space of the Atlantic\r\nstretching around the point 47° 34′ N. and 13° 39′ W., and to 47° 48′\r\nN. and 18° 30′ W. A line drawn west from Belleisle, and another drawn\r\nsouth from Lion’s Bank in the North Atlantic, meet on the field of the\r\noperation of the 28th and 29th of May and the 1st of June.\r\n\r\nWhen he knew that Howe was to leeward of him the French admiral\r\nordered his fleet to come to the wind on the port tack, and stood to\r\nthe westward, in the south-westerly wind. But the inexperience of his\r\ncaptains and crews prevented the quick formation of a good line. Some\r\nof his vessels fell behind and to leeward. A little after one o’clock\r\nhe tacked his ships in succession—one after the other, each tacking\r\nwhere her leader tacked—came back to pick up and cover the isolated\r\nvessels, and then stood to south-east. When the French were seen\r\nthe English fleet pressed to windward, and at a quarter to ten the\r\nsignal was made to prepare for action. As it had to work to windward\r\nits approach was naturally slow, and the whole day might have passed\r\nwithout an encounter but for the bad handling of some of the French\r\nships. As it was, the first shot was not fired till about half-past\r\ntwo. To tack a fleet of the size of the French, in succession, was an\r\noperation requiring some two hours for its due performance. The last\r\nof the line had not reached the turning point when the first of the\r\nEnglish came within striking distance. At that moment the French were\r\nto the south-east and the windward of the English, and all, except the\r\nships which had not returned, were heading to the east-south-east.\r\nHowe had told off a squadron of his best sailing ships to harass\r\nthe enemy’s rear, seize hold of his skirt, as it were, and stop his\r\nattempt to get away. This squadron consisted of Rear-Admiral Pasley’s\r\nflagship, the =Bellerophon=, 74, Captain William Hope; the =Russell=,\r\n74, Captain John Willet Payne; the =Marlborough=, 74, Captain the Hon.\r\nG. Cranfield Berkeley; and the =Thunderer=, 74, Captain Albemarle\r\nBertie. Though the average speed of a French fleet was commonly better\r\nthan our own, the quickest English ships sailed better than the slowest\r\nof the French. As Villaret-Joyeuse was compelled to keep his ships\r\ntogether he had to regulate his speed by that of the worst sailer among\r\nthem. Admiral Pasley’s squadron would probably have overtaken him even\r\nif his evolution had been completed by half-past two. At the moment of\r\nthe first intact the English fleet was heading to the westward towards\r\nthe French rear. At about three o’clock, as the enemy completed his\r\nevolution, it also began to tack in succession, and to follow, still\r\nheading for the rear of Villaret-Joyeuse’s line, and still to leeward,\r\nin pursuit of the opponent who was slipping away to the eastward. The\r\n=Russell=, =Marlborough=, and =Thunderer=, with the frigates, held on\r\nlonger than the others to get into the wake of the French, and then\r\nturned. Both fleets now stood eastward, the French ahead, while the\r\nleading English ships kept up a bickering fire with the end of their\r\nline. At about five o’clock the _Revolutionnaire_, 110, fell back\r\nfrom her place in the line and took post at the rear. Her great bulk\r\nand solidity fitted her to stand battering. Her captain, Vandongen,\r\nfought her stoutly and was killed in the action. As the darkness came\r\non the _Revolutionnaire_ fell behind and put before the wind. She was\r\nengaged by the =Bellerophon=, the =Russell=, the =Thunderer=, the\r\n=Marlborough=, the =Leviathan=, 94, Captain Lord Hugh Seymour, and\r\nthe =Audacious=, 94, Captain William Parker. She suffered severely,\r\nand it was believed in the English fleet that she had surrendered.\r\nIt is probable that she would have been taken if Howe, who did not\r\ntrust all his captains sufficiently to welcome a night action, had\r\nnot recalled the ships engaged at about eight o’clock. She continued\r\nto be engaged on the =Audacious= till nearly ten. Captain Vandongen\r\nfell at nine-thirty. His first and second lieutenants had been killed\r\nor disabled. The third lieutenant, Renaudeau, was wounded immediately\r\nafter taking over the command. The _Revolutionnaire_ staggered out of\r\naction a wreck, under her fourth lieutenant, Dorré. But she had put\r\nher mark on most of the ships which engaged her, having damaged the\r\n=Bellerophon= severely, and shattered the rigging of the =Audacious=\r\nso thoroughly that the English 74 was compelled to put before the wind\r\nand return to Plymouth. The _Revolutionnaire_ reached Brest (where her\r\nofficers and crew were sent to prison on a charge of treason) under the\r\nescort of the _Audacieux_, 74, from Nielly’s squadron, which joined\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse on the 29th but was detached to help her.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the two fleets continued standing to the eastward on\r\nthe starboard tack. Next morning the French were seen to windward,\r\nabout six miles off, on the starboard bow of the English. The\r\n_Audacieux_ was standing across our route some distance ahead to join\r\nher admiral, who, as has just been stated, sent her off to help the\r\n_Revolutionnaire_. At seven o’clock Howe ordered his ships to tack in\r\nsuccession, and menace the rear of the enemy as on the day before. By\r\nthis movement he also manœuvred to set to windward. At about eight\r\no’clock the =Cæsar=, 74, and the =Queen=, 74, the leading ships of\r\nHowe’s line, now heading westward, began to cannonade the rear ships\r\nof the French who were still standing to the east. Villaret-Joyeuse,\r\nseeing his rear ships menaced, and being anxious lest some of them\r\nshould be cut off as on the day before, wore his fleet in succession,\r\nturning them, that is to say, before the wind, and bringing them nearer\r\nthe English. The result of this movement was to bring the French on to\r\nthe same tack as the English, but nearer them though still to windward,\r\nand the two fleets stood on to the west, cannonading one another at\r\nsome distance, for the French hung back from a close engagement. At\r\nhalf-past eleven Howe signalled to his fleet to tack in succession\r\nand pass through the enemy, but deciding, on consideration, that the\r\norder was premature he annulled it, and then repeated it at half-past\r\ntwelve. The smoke made it difficult to see the order, and when it\r\nwas seen it was ill obeyed. The leading ship of the English line,\r\nthe =Cæsar=, was commanded by Captain Molloy, who had commanded the\r\n=Intrepid=, 64, in Graves’ action with Grasse, off the Chesapeake, in\r\nthe previous war, and had then fought with signal gallantry. But in\r\nthe actions of 1794 he suffered, according to his own account, from\r\na persistent course of misfortunes, and, according to others, from\r\na want of zeal, which brought on him great discredit in the fleet,\r\nand condemnation by a court martial. The =Cæsar= was too far from the\r\nenemy, and when she was ordered to tack, she wore, and so went further\r\nthan before, running to leeward of her own friends. The =Queen=, 98,\r\nCaptain John Hutt, the flagship of Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner, the ship\r\nnext to the =Cæsar=, did tack and so did those immediately behind\r\nher, but partly because they were damaged in the rigging, and partly\r\nbecause the French line was well closed, they failed to break it at any\r\npoint. They ran along it on the leeside between it and the centre and\r\nrear of the English fleet. The result of Howe’s manœuvre so far had\r\nbeen to throw his own fleet into confusion. Seeing that if he waited\r\nto tack till his turn came, he might be too late to reach the enemy,\r\nhe tacked his flagship, the =Queen Charlotte=, 100, and broke through\r\nthe French line ahead of the fifth ship from the rear. Then he tacked\r\nagain and stood in the same direction as the French, who were now to\r\nleeward of him. He was followed by his fleet, but in a confused swarm.\r\nIn the prevailing disorder and the smoke, the English could hardly\r\ntell whether their broadside would go into a friend or an enemy. Yet\r\nHowe gained the essential advantage he had aimed at. He forced to\r\nwindward of the French fleet, and gained the weather gage. The two\r\nships in the rear of the French line, the _Indomptable_, 80, Captain\r\nLamesle, and the _Tyrannicide_, 74, Captain Dordelin, were cut off and\r\nsurrounded. Seeing their peril Villaret-Joyeuse wore out of his line\r\nto support them. He was followed by the centre and rear of his fleet,\r\nand he rescued the two ships. He even threatened the =Queen=, which had\r\nbeen much mauled and had fallen behind. His van had followed him. The\r\n=Queen= was promptly supported. Both fleets were in much confusion, and\r\nat five o’clock the fire ceased.\r\n\r\nThe action of the 29th May had ended to the notable advantage of Howe.\r\nThough several of his ships were damaged, none were too disabled to\r\nserve. On the other hand Villaret-Joyeuse had lost the _Indomptable_,\r\nwhich was so much damaged that he felt constrained to send her home\r\nunder escort of the _Mont Blanc_, 74. The _Montagnard_, 74, left\r\nthe fleet without orders. The fleet which had sailed from Brest was\r\ntherefore diminished by loss of four of its ships. Moreover, it had\r\nlost the weather gage, and with it the power to delay a decisive\r\naction. When the action of the 29th ended the French admiral wore\r\nagain, but his fleet on the port tack rejoined his van and stood to\r\nthe west followed by the English fleet. The _Montagnard_, which had\r\nseparated from the fleet, fell in with Admiral Vanstabel and the\r\nconvoy. On the day following the action, the 30th May, Vanstabel, with\r\nhis grain-ships, sailed across the water where it had been fought, and\r\nwhile Howe, who had come out to intercept him, and the Brest fleet,\r\nwhich was there for his protection, were sailing to the west, continued\r\non his way to France.\r\n\r\nThe wind was still south-westerly, but it had diminished in strength.\r\nThe weather became foggy, and the hostile fleets not only lost sight\r\nof one another, but it was often not possible for the ships in each\r\nto see their friends. On the 30th May Villaret-Joyeuse had a piece of\r\nextraordinary good fortune. He was joined by the _Trente-et-un Mai_,\r\n74, Captain Honoré Ganteaume, from Concale, and by Rear-Admiral Nielly,\r\nwith the _Sans Pareil_, 80, Captain Courand; the _Trajan_, 74, Captain\r\nDumourier; and the _Téméraire_, 94, Captain Henry Morel. His fleet was\r\ntherefore again brought up to twenty-six sail. During the 30th and 31st\r\nMay the two fleets continued sailing to the west, sighting one another\r\nin glimpses through the fog. By the evening of the 31st the air had\r\ncleared. The French were then to leeward of the English at a distance\r\nof four or five miles. It was somewhat of a surprise to Howe’s officers\r\nto find their opponent undiminished in numbers and so little damaged.\r\nHowe, who was no more inclined than before to fight a night battle,\r\nand who knew that the French could not now get away, was content to\r\ncontinue on the same tack with them during the night. At dark they were\r\non his lee quarter. When full daylight had come on the 1st June they\r\nhad so far gained on him that they were on his lee bow.\r\n\r\nThe battle now about to be fought is among the most important in the\r\nhistory of naval war. Its significance is to some extent obscured by\r\nthe fact that we see it in the perspective of time—that is to say,\r\nacross subsequent events of an apparently greater order, with which\r\nwe naturally, though unfairly, make our comparisons. But the just\r\ncomparison is with what went before. I have endeavoured to show how\r\nthe British admirals of the eighteenth century had been compelled, and\r\nwere for the most part content, to fight on the poor model provided by\r\nthe Duke of York’s Fighting Instructions. They bore down on the enemy\r\nfrom windward, engaged van to van, centre to centre, rear to rear. And\r\nthey complied with Instruction XVI.: “In all cases of fight with the\r\nenemy the commanders of his majesty’s ships are to keep the fleet _in\r\none line_, and (as much as may be), to preserve that order of battle,\r\nwhich they have been directed to keep, before the time of fight.” The\r\nresult had been to produce such formal and inconclusive actions as\r\nwere fought by Pocock and D’Aché in the East Indies, by Keppel and\r\nD’Orvilliers off Ushant, and in many other places. About the time of\r\nthe American War of 1778-1783 a general impatience had begun to be\r\nfelt with this established system. A witty French minister declared\r\nthat what a naval battle meant was the meeting of two fleets, a great\r\nexpenditure of powder and shot, and a separation—after which the sea\r\nwas never a whit the less salt.\r\n\r\nArbuthnot’s action with Destouches off the Capes of Virginia, Parker’s\r\nfight with Zoutman on the Dogger Bank had exasperated the navy. Then\r\ncame Rodney’s victory off Dominica, when he broke his own line in\r\ndefiance of Instruction XVI. and with brilliant results. We cannot say\r\nwith certainty how far the speculations of Clerk influenced the minds\r\nof naval officers. They have commonly denied him any influence at all.\r\nHis ingenious plans for forcing on decisive actions are open to the\r\ncriticism of Captain White, who, in his notes on Rodney’s battle, said\r\nthat Mr. Clerk would not have found it so easy to manœuvre real ships\r\non real water, as to move his models on the dining-room table. The\r\nlate Rear-Admiral May, when Captain of the College at Greenwich, once\r\nobserved to me, while looking at Clerk’s scheme for an attack on the\r\nenemy’s rear from windward, that it was very pretty if the enemy was\r\nfool enough to let you carry it out. There are no _bottes secrètes_ in\r\nwar—no lunges which cannot be parried. Any attack is effective only\r\nwhen the better fighter tries it on the less good. And here we come to\r\nthe root of the matter—to that dominating idea of Clerk’s book which\r\nremains sound whatever may be the value of his applications.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to know what that idea really was. I do not think\r\nthat it is to be found in his ingenious plans for concentrating a\r\nsuperior number of ships on an inferior number of the enemy’s. Every\r\nsuch attempt to concentrate can be countered and baffled by an alert\r\nopponent. The real value of Clerk’s speculations lies in the truth of\r\nthe hypothesis on which he reasoned, and the general recommendation,\r\nor exhortation, he founded thereupon. They are to be read in the\r\nintroduction to his book on Tactics. He said to naval officers that\r\nthey and their crews were superior in quality to their enemies, and had\r\nproved that superiority in single ship actions, yet their great battles\r\nhad commonly led to no decisive result, and why? Because they allowed\r\nthemselves to be tied by pedantic rules. These rules were useful to\r\nthe side which wished to avoid a decisive action. To the stronger, who\r\nhad every reason to wish for a chance to develop his strength, they\r\nwere bonds and obstructions. Therefore, he urged, use your formation\r\nas a means of bringing your ships into action. Then it has served its\r\npurpose, and you can let it go, break into your enemy’s formation, and\r\nallow free play to your individual superiority. With or without his\r\nhelp, or spontaneously, and with stimulus from him, these opinions\r\nhad been spreading in the navy. On the 1st June 1794 the time and the\r\nopportunity for their application had come. Howe’s claim to rank among\r\nthe great captains is based on the fact that he did apply them.\r\n\r\nHe would hold his place, even if it could be shown that he did not do\r\nthe best he could have done. The prevailing authorities are agreed that\r\nhe did not, and the more friendly plead his sixty-eight years, and\r\nthe strain which had been laid on him, as excuses. It had been severe\r\nsince the 2nd May, and heavy indeed since the morning of the 28th. The\r\nobligatory remark that Nelson would have done far otherwise is rarely\r\nomitted. I shall not undertake to prove a negative. Being the younger\r\nman, Nelson might have had the strength to do more than Howe if he had\r\never met an opponent who had capacity and opportunity to manœuvre. Let\r\nus leave easy and barren assumptions aside, and see what were the facts\r\nwith which Howe had to deal.\r\n\r\nIn the first place he knew, by his experience on the 29th, that the\r\nfleet on his lee-bow could and would manœuvre. Villaret-Joyeuse had\r\nshown, by wearing out of his line to extricate the _Indomptable_ and\r\nthe _Tyrannicide_, that he was not the man to lie idle while part of\r\nhis fleet was assailed by superior numbers. The French admiral was\r\nquite capable of countering any attempt at concentration. On the other\r\nhand, Howe could not rely on the intelligent execution of his orders\r\nby all his captains. The simpler the task he set them the better would\r\nit be executed. Then he knew that while the manœuvring power of the\r\nFrench was not contemptible, their gunnery was bad. The loss of life in\r\nhis fleet had been small, and none of his ships had been so disabled\r\non the 29th as to be unable to take her place in the line on the 1st\r\nJune. Therefore it followed that so long as the ships of the two fleets\r\nwere fairly matched in size, a superior power would be developed by\r\neach English ship by virtue of her better gunnery. What was required\r\nwas that the action should be close, and that the enemy should not\r\nbe allowed to practise the favourite French manœuvre of firing to\r\ndismast, and then slipping away to leeward. The end could be obtained\r\nby bearing down on the enemy, van to van, centre to centre, rear to\r\nrear, not for the purpose of hauling up to windward and then keeping in\r\nthe same order, while the enemy went off on his open line of retreat,\r\nbut to break in on him, to pass through his line, to cut his retreat,\r\nand so to force him to fight it out. The process of breaking through\r\nwould give opportunities to rake the enemy’s ships, a _mêlée_ would be\r\nproduced, and the individual superiority of the English ships would\r\nhave free play. When Howe decided on this departure from tradition, he,\r\nwith his sixty-eight years and his training in the strictest sect of\r\nthe Pharisees, showed a greater daring, a greater originality, than was\r\nto be displayed by the men who followed him, who handled more practised\r\nfleets, who benefited by the confidence he had inspired, who fought\r\nenemies whose nerve he had broken. The battle of the 1st June was the\r\nfoundation of the later superiority of the English fleet, and by far\r\nthe most essential part of any building is its foundation.\r\n\r\nLord Howe signalled that he meant to attack the centre of the enemy’s\r\nline, and then that he would break through and engage to leeward. His\r\nline bore up at about a quarter-past eight, after a pause had been made\r\nto allow the men to have breakfast. The approach was slow, for the\r\nopportunity was taken to rectify the order of the ships so that they\r\nshould be fairly matched. The course steered was to the north-west, the\r\nships advancing on oblique lines to assail the enemy who was on their\r\nbow, and who lay in very good order awaiting the attack, in a line\r\nahead from west to east. The wind, though less strong than on previous\r\ndays, was still from the south-west, and the sea was calmer than it had\r\nbeen for the last few days.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly half-past nine when Howe’s fleet came within range of\r\nthe French guns and the enemy opened fire. For a few moments none of\r\nhis ships answered. They were waiting till they were in a position to\r\nanswer with effect. If the admiral’s orders had been exactly obeyed\r\neach of his captains would have steered for the space astern of the\r\nFrenchman corresponding to himself in the hostile line, and would\r\nhave passed through it, and would have engaged to leeward. But the\r\norder was not exactly obeyed, sometimes because the French closed\r\ntheir line and no open space was left; sometimes because the rapidly\r\ngathering cloud of smoke deprived zealous officers of the power to see;\r\nsometimes because an effective effort to obey was not made. The signal\r\nto pass through the enemy’s line was accompanied by a superfluous\r\nand mischievous note to the effect that the captain who could not\r\nfind a place to pass was at liberty to engage without passing. It was\r\nsuperfluous, because there was surely no necessity to tell any man that\r\nhe was not expected to do the physically impossible, and mischievous,\r\nbecause this official recognition of the alternative gave the weaker\r\nsort an excuse for not doing their utmost. There were those who did\r\nnot. The =Cæsar= hauled up too far to windward, exposed herself to\r\nthe concentrated fire of the leading French ships, was damaged, made\r\ndistracted vacillating movements, was of no use, and yet suffered\r\nmore loss of life than some vessels which really contributed to the\r\nvictory. Following the line from west to east, the =Bellerophon=\r\nengaged the _Gasparin_ to windward, but close and hotly, till the\r\nFrenchman, together with his next ahead, the _Convention_, flinched,\r\nbore up and ran to leeward, heading to the east. The rigging of the\r\n=Bellerophon= was cut to pieces, and she could not follow. Yet she\r\nlost fewer men than the =Cæsar=. But Admiral Pasley, who lost his\r\nleg, was among the wounded. The =Leviathan= engaged the _America_ to\r\nwindward to good purpose, pushing her hard, driving her out, following\r\nher, and swinging round to leeward of her as she strove to follow her\r\nleaders to the eastward. Old habit had fixed the French captains in\r\nthe faith that a naval battle was to be fought by firing to dismast\r\nand then slipping away to form a new line to leeward. The =Russell=\r\nengaged the _Téméraire_ till this French ship also slipped away. Then\r\nshe pressed on, and falling in with the _America_ helped to take her.\r\nThe =Royal Sovereign= fought the _Terrible_, drove her out of the line,\r\nand then joined in overwhelming the _America_. The =Marlborough= broke\r\nthrough the French line astern of the _Impétueux_, the next behind the\r\n_Terrible_, became entangled with the former and the _Mucius_, her next\r\nastern, so that the three fell aboard one another, and the English ship\r\nwas severely mauled. The =Defence= cut the line between the _Mucius_\r\nand the _Eole_, suffering much. The =Impregnable=, =Tremendous=, and\r\n=Barfleur= engaged the _Tourville_, _Trajan_, and _Tyrannicide_ to\r\nwindward—not as closely as Howe would have wished. The =Barfleur= was\r\nthe flagship of Admiral Bowyer, who also was wounded, and her captain\r\nwas Cuthbert Collingwood, the most calmly intrepid of men. No want of\r\ngoodwill can have restrained him. In the smoke her crew could see only\r\na short distance. They believed, and for a time Collingwood himself\r\nbelieved, that a French ship beside them had sunk. “Up jumped the\r\nJohnnies on the guns and cheered,” so Collingwood records, but they\r\nwere mistaken. The =Culloden= and =Gibraltar= fired from windward, not\r\nclosely, nor to the purpose. The =Queen Charlotte=, Howe’s flagship,\r\nwas steered to break the line astern of the French flagship, the\r\n_Montagne_. As she came down she took the fire of the _Jacobin_ and the\r\n_Achille_, the next French vessels, without reply. The captain of the\r\n_Montagne_—or the Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse—understood her aim, backed\r\ntheir sails, and endeavoured to bar her road. Gassin, the captain of\r\nthe _Jacobin_, saw it too, and, letting all draw, shot ahead to close\r\nthe line. He took the officer-like course, but he took it too eagerly.\r\nThe _Jacobin_ nearly ran into the stern of the _Montagne_, and to avoid\r\na collision had to port her helm, and was carried on till she ranged\r\nup on the leeside of the flagship. The =Queen Charlotte= swept through\r\nthe space left by her advance. The flag of the _Montagne_ flapped\r\nagainst the shrouds of the English flagship, so closely did she pass.\r\nHer broadside was delivered with shattering force, and then she ranged\r\nup between the _Montagne_ and the _Jacobin_. If either had been laid on\r\nher bow she must have suffered, if not disaster, still great injury.\r\nBut the _Jacobin_ soon stood on, and then so did the _Montagne_, which\r\nhad made little or no reply to the English fire. The =Brunswick= headed\r\nto pass through the gap left by the _Achille_ which had followed\r\nthe _Jacobin_, but Captain Renaudin, of the _Vengeur_, stood on and\r\nbarred the way. Then Captain John Harvey, of the =Brunswick=, obeyed\r\nthe admiral’s signal in the spirit since in the letter he could not.\r\nHe ran into the French ship, his three starboard anchors hooking the\r\nFrenchman’s port fore-shrouds and fore-channels. When his master, Mr.\r\nStewart, asked if the anchors should be cut away he answered, “No,\r\nwe have got her, and we will keep her.” The two ships turned before\r\nthe wind, and drifted to leeward, grappled one to the other. The\r\n=Valiant=, the =Orion=, the =Queen=, the =Ramillies=, the =Alfred=,\r\nthe =Montague=, all engaged to windward more or less closely—some of\r\nthem notably rather less than more. The =Royal George= broke through\r\nbetween the _Républicain_ and the _Sans-Pareil_. The =Majestic= engaged\r\nto windward. The =Glory= broke in among the ships of the French rear,\r\nand the =Thunderer= passed behind the last of them, and so entered the\r\nmêlée.\r\n\r\nThese movements which must needs be told consecutively, were\r\ncontemporaneous, or nearly so. As the French ships pushed on to close\r\nspaces ahead of them, a westerly movement was given to the line, and\r\nthe English vessels furthest to the east had the greater distance to\r\ngo and so came later into action. Though Howe’s orders were not fully\r\nobeyed the French formation was broken, and the English were mingled\r\nwith the enemy’s vessels in confusion. Out of that confusion order\r\nwas again evolved. The general movement to leeward carried most of the\r\nFrench clear, and among them the _Montagne_, which shook off the =Queen\r\nCharlotte=, crippled by the loss of her main topmast. When the two\r\nfleets were disentangled, Villaret-Joyeuse was able to form a line to\r\nleeward, but ten of his ships were surrounded by the English. He came\r\ngallantly back to their assistance and rescued four, the _Républicain_,\r\nthe _Mucius_, the _Scipion_, and the _Jemmapes_. Two of the English\r\nships were put in peril by his return—the =Queen=, which had eagerly\r\npushed through the broken French rear, and the =Brunswick=, which had\r\ndrifted away locked to the _Vengeur_. Their strife was furious, and\r\ncarried to a decisive conclusion. Captain Harvey was mortally wounded,\r\nbut the _Vengeur_, shattered by the fire of the =Brunswick= and other\r\nEnglish vessels, sank, carrying part of her crew down with her, but not\r\nbefore she had surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe return of Villaret-Joyeuse alarmed the captain of the fleet, Sir\r\nRoger Curtis, and he urged the admiral to call his ships about him lest\r\nthe Frenchman should take his revenge. Howe, so exhausted by four days\r\nof strain that he nearly fell from fatigue, yielded to his importunity.\r\nThe English ships were recalled, and before two o’clock the action\r\nceased. We remained in possession of six prizes, the _Sans-Pareil_,\r\n_Juste_, _America_, _Impétueux_, _Northumberland_, and _Achille_. The\r\ntotal loss of life from the 28th May to the 10th June was but 290\r\nkilled. The wounded were 858. The casualty list of the six French ships\r\ntaken was greater—1266 in all, and the total loss must have been very\r\nmuch heavier.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the campaign did not end when the fleets drew apart\r\non the afternoon of the 1st June. Admiral Montagu was not allowed to\r\nremain in Plymouth Sound. When the =Audacious= brought news on the 3rd\r\nJune that the fleets were in contact, he was ordered out again, and he\r\nsailed on the 4th with nine sail of the line. On the 8th June he was\r\noff Brest where he found himself in the midst of enemies. A reserve\r\nsquadron had been fitted out in the port, and two at sea. It was weaker\r\nthan Montagu’s, and retired before him to Bertheaume Bay. But on the\r\n9th the fleet of Villaret-Joyeuse, diminished, but still formidable\r\nto Montagu’s squadron of nine, hove in sight. He slipped between the\r\ntwo, and retreated to Plymouth where he anchored on the 12th. In the\r\nmeantime, Vanstabel, who, after crossing the scene of the action of the\r\n29th May, had anchored at Penmarch, came into Brest under cover of the\r\nFrench fleet, and the great food convoy was safely housed. The main\r\nEnglish fleet made for home when it lost sight of the French on the 1st\r\nof June. Part of the ships were left at Plymouth, but the majority and\r\nthe prizes anchored at Spithead on the 13th of June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE WAR TILL THE END OF 1797\r\n\r\n Authorities.—See the list of Authorities in the previous Chapter.\r\n     Also, _Projets et Tentatives de Débarquement aux Îles Britanniques_\r\n     by Captain Desbrière.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe victory of the 1st of June was followed by an interval of more\r\nthan two years marked by no great naval conflict. The French Navy\r\nwas at once too completely disorganised and too ill-directed to act\r\nwith effect. It was indeed driven to exertions injurious only to\r\nitself by the Jacobin rulers in Paris, who were themselves driven on\r\nby such passions as the “beastly froth of rage” which caused them to\r\nissue their decree of the 24th May 1794—the decree forbidding their\r\narmies and fleets to give quarter to Hanoverians or Englishmen. It\r\nwas repealed on the 30th December, five months after the fall of the\r\nTerrorists on the 27th of July, and when experience had shown the\r\nFrench that not they but their enemies were to have the more frequent\r\nopportunities to refuse quarter. The English fleet had no substantial\r\nopponent at sea at whom to strike, and was, moreover, but poorly led\r\nfor the most part.\r\n\r\nIn the Channel, Howe, who continued to hold the command though his\r\nhealth never recovered from the strain of the campaign of 1794, cruised\r\nfrom September till the end of the year.[2] But he continued to prefer\r\nhis own system of watching the French from an English channel port by\r\nmeans of a lookout maintained by frigates. His infirmities and age were\r\nin fact disqualifying him for active service. He would willingly have\r\nretired, and indeed was never at sea after the spring of 1795, though\r\nhe was compelled, by the unwillingness of the Government to allow him\r\nto resign, to retain the nominal command. Lord Bridport, brother of\r\nLord Hood, who first acted for him at sea and then succeeded him in the\r\nChannel command, held the same views as to the best way of using the\r\nfleet, and applied them with far less energy and faculty.\r\n\r\nThe Admiralty did not as yet impose a more vigorous line of action on\r\nits admirals. Between the growing weakness of Howe, the natural want\r\nof energy of Bridport, and the lack of intelligent direction from\r\nWhitehall, the movements of the Channel fleet went somewhat by fits\r\nand starts. In November, the =Canada=, 74, Captain Hamilton, came into\r\nTorbay, where Howe was at anchor, with the news that he had barely\r\nescaped from a French squadron which had taken his colleague, the\r\n=Alexander=, 74, commanded by Captain R. R. Bligh, a different man\r\nfrom the officer whose name is for ever associated with the mutiny of\r\nthe =Bounty=. Howe went at once to cruise off Ushant, believing that\r\nthe main French fleet was at sea. But it was only a small squadron\r\ncommanded by Nielly, which had taken the =Alexander= as she and the\r\n=Canada= came back from convoy duty. Howe’s fleet, which included four\r\nPortuguese liners, was much blown about and damaged by rough weather.\r\n\r\nIf the English ships, and to a greater extent our Portuguese friends,\r\nsuffered from the rough weather of the Channel in autumn and winter,\r\nthe French fleet at Brest was all but finally ruined. Villaret-Joyeuse\r\nwas hounded out to sea on the 24th December with thirty-five sail of\r\nthe line. Six of these were to form a detached squadron under Renaudin,\r\nwho had been promoted to Rear-Admiral for his gallant defence of the\r\n_Vengeur_. He was to take his command round to Toulon. So great was\r\nthe distress of all France, and particularly of its poorest province\r\n(Brittany) for food, that it had not been found possible to provision\r\nany of these thirty-five ships except the six of Renaudin’s command\r\nfor more than three weeks. The hostility of all Europe and the penury\r\nof their Government combined to deprive the French of naval stores.\r\nTheir ships were patched up by makeshift devices and with inferior\r\nmaterial. Half a century after 1795, the Prince de Joinville noted\r\nthat as the French maritime population was very poor and ill fed, the\r\nmen drawn from it for service in the fleet were inferior in size and\r\nstrength to the seamen of the north of Europe—including, of course,\r\nGreat Britain. He found that these men did not gain strength till they\r\nhad been well fed and well looked after in the navy for some months. In\r\n1795 the French seacoast population was even poorer than about 1840,\r\nand the men drawn from it were not sufficiently clad, and were fed\r\non almost starvation rations in the fleet. We must remember that our\r\nsuccesses were gained against overstrained and patched-up ships, with\r\ninferior spars fished with bad material and sails of poor cloth; manned\r\nby crews not only raw from want of practice, but weak from downright\r\nwant of food, and depressed by a sense of inferiority in knowledge\r\nand force. Our ancestors rejoiced in looking at caricatures of the\r\nstarving French reduced to mere scarecrows by hunger, and in comparing\r\nthem with the typical Englishman, a mass of fat and brawn. The French\r\nhad made themselves hateful by their aggressions and plunderings, and\r\nwe resented their arrogant claim to impose regeneration and freedom\r\non their neighbours while they were themselves in a squalid welter of\r\nbloodstained anarchy. Yet they were gallant men who faced storm and\r\nbattle in such destitution—and we shall not again have to meet enemies\r\nenfeebled as they were.\r\n\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse had to face a December gale with such a fleet when\r\nhe obeyed his orders on the 24th of December in 1794. It drove the\r\n_Républicain_ on the rocks, and his fleet had to anchor in Camaret\r\nBay. He sailed on the 30th, only to suffer a month of misery. The\r\n_Neuf Thermidor_ (the _Jacobin_ of the 1st of June renamed), the\r\n_Scipion_, and the _Superbe_ sank. The _Neptune_ was driven on shore.\r\nBy the 2nd February the weakened fleet was back at Brest. The news\r\nthat the French were at sea brought Howe out for his last cruise, to\r\nintercept them if possible, and to cover the trade. The stormy weather\r\ndisposed of Villaret-Joyeuse, who, however, captured a hundred of our\r\nmerchant-ships, and the =Daphne=, a 20-gun ship, and Howe returned to\r\nSpithead after looking into Brest to be sure that the French fleet was\r\nnot at sea. If he had been outside Brest on the 24th of December, the\r\nFrench might have been spared a disaster. Yet the weakness of his\r\nmethod of watching from afar off and starting to pursue from a distance\r\nwas clearly demonstrated immediately after his return to Spithead.\r\nRenaudin sailed with his six line-of-battle ships on the 22nd of\r\nFebruary, and reached Toulon unmolested by us, on the 2nd April, but\r\nhaving suffered much from the weather, and with a long sick list.\r\n\r\nThe French took advantage of the absence of a blockading fleet off\r\nBrest to send out squadrons to protect their own coast trade and attack\r\nour commerce. In May an English watching squadron of five sail of the\r\nline under Cornwallis was off Ushant. It saw and pursued a French force\r\nof three liners under Rear-Admiral Vence, then engaged on convoy duty.\r\nVence fled to the Penmarchs, pursued by Cornwallis, who took part of\r\nhis convoy on the 8th and 9th of June. The danger of Vence brought\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse out from Brest with nine sail. Cornwallis was pursued\r\nand overtaken on the 16th, but so poor was the gunnery of the French\r\nthat though they attacked his rearmost ships on both sides, they did\r\nlittle harm, and suffered not a little themselves. Cornwallis got safe\r\nto Plymouth with his prizes, and his retreat was highly praised for its\r\nsteadiness and good management. Bad weather forced the French back to\r\nBelleisle, and when they turned again to Brest on the 19th June they\r\nfell in with another and a stronger opponent.\r\n\r\nThe Vendéens were still fighting for the royal cause in France, and\r\nwere calling for help to the Royalist exiles and for the presence of a\r\nprince to lead them. An expedition had been prepared in England, which\r\nwas to have been commanded by the Count d’Artois—in after times King\r\nCharles X. It included 200 exiled officers of the old French Navy,\r\nand sailed on the 11th June from Spithead under the protection of Sir\r\nJohn Borlase Warren, who had his flag in a frigate, but had three\r\nline-of-battle ships and fifty transports. Lord Bridport accompanied\r\nthe expedition with fourteen sail of the line to protect it from the\r\nBrest fleet. Warren’s mission was to land the Royalists at Quiberon. On\r\nthe 19th June Bridport dispatched him to Quiberon, and steered himself\r\nfor Brest. Immediately after Warren had parted from Bridport on his\r\nway south-east to Quiberon, he sighted Villaret-Joyeuse on his way\r\nback from Belleisle to Brest. He retreated, warned Bridport, and the\r\ntwo rejoined on the 20th. Bridport took the three liners of Warren’s\r\nsquadron, and pursued Villaret-Joyeuse. On the 23rd June there was a\r\nconfused encounter about the island of Groix, which lies north-west\r\nof Belleisle. The French admiral was ill obeyed by his overtaxed\r\nsubordinates, who disregarded signals, and fled to L’Orient, on the\r\nmainland opposite Groix. Three of his ships were overtaken and captured\r\nafter a gallant resistance. The dangers of the coast and a fog added to\r\nthe disorders of the fight. The French admiral complained bitterly of\r\nthe conduct of his captains. Bridport, who had three prizes to show,\r\nthe _Alexandre_ (the English =Alexander= taken by Nielly on the 7th\r\nNovember of the previous year through her bad sailing, and now retaken\r\nfor the same reason), the _Tigre_, and the _Formidable_, renamed by\r\nus the =Belleisle=, was praised for his victory. But the opinion of\r\nhis fleet and the verdict of history was adequately expressed by\r\nCodrington, then captain of the =Babet= frigate in his fleet. “It is\r\ngreatly to be regretted that His Lordship called the ships out of\r\naction, as they could of course go where the large French three-decker\r\ndid. He might have captured or destroyed all the ships of the enemy.”\r\nWarren remained on the coast till September a helpless eye-witness of\r\nthe dreadful fate of the French Royalists at Quiberon. Nearly all the\r\n200 naval officers among them perished in the water, in action, or\r\nbefore the Republican firing parties. Frenchmen who were prepared to\r\nassert that Perfidious Albion had contrived the whole disaster in order\r\nto secure the destruction of the dreaded royal corps, have not been\r\nwanting. The French ships at L’Orient remained till the close of the\r\nyear, unmanned partly by desertion, partly by the disbanding of crews\r\nwhich could not be fed. During the last days of 1795 and the first of\r\n1796 they were remanned after a fashion, and slipped away to Brest and\r\nRochefort.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the French armies had overrun Holland at the close\r\nof 1794, had driven out the army of the Duke of York, and had set up\r\na subject republic. Our ally became our enemy, and a squadron had to\r\nbe told off to watch the Texel under Duncan, in company with a dozen\r\nvery ill-found Russian warships. But from the date of Lord Bridport’s\r\nvictory till the close of 1796 there was little for the fleet to do in\r\nthe Channel and North Sea but to watch. Want of funds compelled the\r\nRepublican Government to follow the example given by Louis XIV. after\r\n1693—to lay up its main fleets and take to commerce destroying.\r\n\r\nThe operations in the Mediterranean from December 1793, when Hood was\r\nforced to retreat from Toulon, till Jervis evacuated the Mediterranean\r\nin December of 1796, correspond with the campaigns in the Channel—with\r\nthe exception that they include no 1st of June.\r\n\r\nWhen he had withdrawn his ships filled with French refugees from\r\nToulon, Hood paused for a time at Hyères. The refugees had to be\r\nprovided for at Leghorn, from whence most of them returned home\r\nafter the fall of the Terrorists. The remnant of the French fleet\r\nat Toulon could not move for months. An opportunity for dealing a\r\nsevere blow to France was presented by the state of the island of\r\nCorsica. The Corsicans had not wholly renounced the hope of achieving\r\nindependence of the French, who had conquered them some thirty years\r\nearlier. One party among them was deeply offended by the irreligion\r\nof the French Republicans. It had for chief the famous Pasqual Paoli,\r\nwho had fought against the French conquest, and had for years been\r\na pensioner in England. He had returned to Corsica by favour of the\r\nRevolution, and was now in the possession of great influence over his\r\ncountrymen. Paoli, who hoped to secure the independence of Corsica\r\nunder English protection,—which meant to govern the country himself\r\nwith our support,—offered his co-operation. Hood sailed from Hyères on\r\nthe 24th of January 1794, bringing with him the British troops under\r\nSir David Dundas. A storm forced the fleet to Elba and caused delay.\r\nBut the occupation of the island with the help of Paoli was an easy\r\nundertaking. The few French troops took refuge in the coast towns of\r\nBastia and Calvi. Dundas declined to co-operate at Bastia on the ground\r\nthat he had no adequate force. But Bastia was taken between the 4th of\r\nApril and the 21st of May by the seamen, the marines, and the soldiers\r\nappointed to serve as marines, who were under Hood’s orders. Calvi was\r\nbesieged on the 19th June, and surrendered on the 10th of August. The\r\nfact that Nelson, the only one of our admirals whose personality has\r\nstamped itself on the memory and imagination of the English people,\r\nwas concerned in these sieges and lost his right eye at Calvi, has\r\ngiven them an undeserved prominence. The garrisons were cut off from\r\nsupplies by sea and land, and must have surrendered when they did,\r\nif no shot had been fired against them. On the 14th June Corsica was\r\ndeclared a kingdom, with George III. for its sovereign, and coins were\r\nstruck in his name. But our hold on the island was weak. It depended\r\nin reality on the continued support of Paoli and on his retention of\r\ninfluence over his countrymen. Sir Gilbert Elliot, our Commissioner\r\nfirst at Toulon and then in Corsica, ruined the whole foundation of our\r\nposition. Sir Gilbert was a high-minded and able man, a conspicuous\r\nmember of that portion of the Whig Opposition which was shocked by the\r\nFrench Revolution into allying itself with Pitt. He would not consent\r\nto govern by the advice of Paoli, and would endeavour to introduce\r\nclean-handed methods of administration, impartial justice, and the\r\nBritish jury among a people divided by irreconcilable family feuds.\r\nWith the best intentions in the world, he mortally offended our only\r\npossible friends, the Paolists, who hoped for a self-governing Corsica\r\nadministered by them, and he entirely failed to placate our enemies.\r\nThe calm and perfectly right-minded manifestation of the innate and\r\ncomprehensive superiority of Englishmen on the part of our officers,\r\ndid not fail to produce its unfailing effect. It exasperated the\r\nCorsicans beyond endurance. We were soon universally hated, and our\r\ntenure of Corsica was certain to end whenever a serious attack could be\r\nmade on us from outside. A very few months of English virtue converted\r\nthe population into partisans of the French. A far larger army than we\r\ncould spare, frequently reinforced, would have been required to hold\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nThe attack came by the end of 1796. Until then we were employed in\r\nbeating back successive feeble sorties of the French from Toulon, and\r\nin co-operating with the Austrian armies in Northern Italy. The efforts\r\nof the French to maintain their hold on Corsica by expeditions from a\r\nruined dockyard were begun with a promptitude highly honourable to\r\ntheir energy. As early as the 5th June, just over six months after the\r\nexpulsion of the allies, Admiral Martin sailed with seven ships of\r\nthe line. He met with a slight measure of success, for he retook the\r\n_Alceste_, a frigate carried away in December, and assigned to Sardinia\r\nas her share of the prizes. But when Hood, warned by his frigates, took\r\nup the pursuit of the French squadron, it could but retire and seek\r\nrefuge in the Golfe Juan, commonly called by English sailors Gourjean.\r\nHood, who had an old experience of attacks on fleets at anchor, laid\r\na plan to fall on the French two upon one. But it was delayed by\r\nunfavourable weather till Martin had fortified his ships by batteries\r\non shore. A scheme for using fireships was given up as impracticable.\r\nMartin was blockaded by a combined English and Spanish squadron under\r\nHotham till a storm drove the watchers off, and he escaped to Toulon on\r\nthe 2nd of November. It would seem that the allies might as well have\r\nbeen off Toulon in May. But the method of watching from afar, which in\r\nthe Mediterranean meant from San Fiorenzo or Leghorn, was as much a\r\nfavourite with Hood as with Howe. In November, Hood went home on leave,\r\nand on the understanding that he was to return. But he could not agree\r\nwith ministers, and did not go to sea again.\r\n\r\nHotham, his successor, an easy-going gentleman, was not the man to\r\nchange a method of conducting war which gave him much time at anchor at\r\nSan Fiorenzo or Leghorn. He had gone to Leghorn to cover convoys which\r\ncould have been much better covered by a close blockade of Toulon, when\r\nMartin put to sea again, on the 2nd March, with fifteen sail of the\r\nline. The 12,000 men required to make up the crews of these vessels\r\nhad been found only by drafting 7500 soldiers into them. Martin had\r\nonly 2300 sailors in addition to officers and petty officers. A gleam\r\nof good fortune was again allowed him. On the 7th March he took the\r\n=Berwick=, 74. Her masts had been rolled out of her by the carelessness\r\nof her officers, and she was following Hotham to Leghorn under jury\r\nrig. But this small advantage was all Martin could gain. Hotham, who\r\nsailed from Leghorn on the 9th, was informed of the whereabouts of the\r\nFrench by his frigates on the 10th. He pursued in baffling breezes\r\nand calms. On the 13th and 14th an encounter took place between them\r\nwhich has some resemblance to Bridport’s action near Groix. The French\r\nstraggled, and the French admiral was ill obeyed. Two French vessels,\r\nthe _Ça Ira_, 80, and the _Censeur_, 74, were taken after a stout\r\nresistance. Some vague cannonading on opposite tacks took place between\r\nthe fleets. It is to the credit of the French that they inflicted a\r\nloss of 74 killed and 284 wounded on the English vessels most exposed\r\nto their fire. The =Illustrious=, 74, Captain Frederick, lost 90\r\nof the total. Hotham had with him a Neapolitan 74, the _Tancredi_,\r\ncommanded by a man whose name is associated closely with the Royal\r\nNavy for another reason, the unhappy Carracciolo. When the fragmentary\r\nbattle was over, Hotham excited the wrath of his subordinate Nelson by\r\nplacidly putting aside advice to pursue with vigour on the ground that\r\ntwo vessels had been taken and they had done very well.\r\n\r\nAn admiral of this kidney was not the man either to intercept Renaudin,\r\nwho joined Martin at Hyères on the 4th April, or to keep the French\r\nconfined to Toulon. They were almost ruined there by a mutiny of\r\nstarving, unpaid men, but got over the difficulty, and were at sea\r\nagain on the 7th June. The second sortie was even feebler than the\r\nfirst. Martin chased Nelson, who had been detached to Genoa, back on\r\nHotham, at San Fiorenzo. Though reinforced by Renaudin, he was weaker\r\nthan the English admiral, who had been joined by Admiral Mann with nine\r\nsail of the line on the 14th June. There was nothing for it but another\r\nretreat, another ineffectual distant cannonade—the final retreat of\r\nMartin to Toulon, and the return of Hotham to San Fiorenzo.\r\n\r\nAs the English admiral moved periodically from San Fiorenzo to Leghorn\r\nand from Leghorn back to San Fiorenzo, there was obviously nothing to\r\nprevent Richery from leaving Toulon on the 24th September with six of\r\nthe line and three frigates on a cruise to America. He did so, passed\r\nthe Rock of Gibraltar, and on the 7th October fell in with an English\r\nconvoy of thirty-one merchant-ships under the protection of two 74’s\r\nand the French prize _Censeur_ armed _en flûte_. Richery retook the\r\n_Censeur_ and captured nearly all the merchant-ships. Spain having\r\nmade peace with France in July, Richery was able to take his prizes\r\ninto Cadiz, where he was promptly blockaded by Rear-Admiral Mann with\r\nsix ships, and so remained for months. Hotham, again, was not the man\r\nto prevent Honoré Ganteaume from leaving Toulon for a cruise in the\r\nLevant on the 10th October. He did sail with one of the line and five\r\nfrigates, released some scattered French vessels watched by us, did\r\nconsiderable damage to Russian and English trade, escaped the pursuit\r\nof Troubridge, and was back at Toulon on the 5th February 1796. Hotham,\r\nworn out by his exertions, resigned his command to Sir Hyde Parker on\r\nthe 1st November 1795, and sailed for home, to be rewarded by an Irish\r\npeerage. Sir Hyde Parker was superseded by Sir John Jervis on the 30th\r\nof the month.\r\n\r\nDuring 1796 the new admiral could do little, for the French fleet was\r\nparalysed by penury in the Mediterranean as in the Channel. He had to\r\nlook on almost helplessly while Napoleon, who took command of the army\r\nof Italy in March, was conducting the first and perhaps the greatest of\r\nhis campaigns. It was at least a campaign which showed what genius and\r\nenthusiasm, even if it be only enthusiasm for a full belly and plenty\r\nof plunder, can do against professional pedantry and routine. By June\r\nhis victories had cowed Naples into deserting the coalition, and her\r\nhelp, such as it was, was lost. On the 28th June he seized Leghorn,\r\nand a source of supply to the fleet was lost, an opening for British\r\ntrade was closed. The loss of Corsica was seen to be at hand, and on\r\nthe 10th July Elba was seized as an alternative storehouse. Jervis’\r\nfleet hampered the French coast trade, and captured a battering-train\r\non its way to the siege of Mantua. But Spain, whirled about by every\r\nfolly under the rule of Godoy, was seen to be coming into the war.\r\nOn the 25th August, Jervis received orders from home to evacuate\r\nCorsica. Nelson was appointed to superintend the evacuation on the 26th\r\nSeptember, and when he withdrew from before Leghorn to execute the\r\norder, a French expedition under General Gentili crossed to the island\r\non the 19th October, on the very day we retired somewhat harassed by\r\nthe partisans of France.\r\n\r\nWhile we were withdrawing from Corsica, the movements of the fleets\r\nseemed to be leading to a clash of battle. On the 29th of July, Jervis\r\nwisely desirous to concentrate his forces, had recalled Mann from\r\nbefore Cadiz. He came, but without stores, and Leghorn being now shut\r\nto us and Corsica unfriendly, he had to be sent down to Gibraltar\r\nto fill up. While he was absent, Richery had sailed on a plundering\r\nexpedition to Newfoundland, escorted by Don Juan de Lángara with a\r\nSpanish fleet on the 7th August. Spain did not declare war till the 5th\r\nOctober, but the declaration was then as always a mere formality. After\r\nseeing Richery on his way, Lángara returned, and on the 29th September\r\nleft for Toulon with nineteen sail. On the 1st October he met Mann,\r\nand chased him into Gibraltar. Then he went on towards Toulon, picking\r\nup seven more ships of the line, which raised his force to twenty-six\r\nsail. Mann, moved by reasons which pass all understanding, called a\r\ncouncil of war, which as usual agreed with the commanding officer,\r\nand sailed for England. His withdrawal weakened Jervis vitally. In\r\nafter days the admiral said that if Mann had rejoined him, the battle\r\nwhich was to be fought off Cape St. Vincent on the following 14th\r\nFebruary would have been fought in the Mediterranean. Yet it is to be\r\nobserved that Jervis fought at St. Vincent with fifteen ships against\r\ntwenty-seven. Now, when Lángara was seen off Cape Corso on the 5th\r\nOctober with twenty-six sail, Jervis was near at hand in Mortella Bay\r\nwith fourteen. He had many responsibilities on him—the troops to be\r\nwithdrawn from Corsica, the garrison at Elba, and the French not far\r\noff at Toulon. On the 14th February of next year he was free to make\r\nplay with his admirable squadron. Yet it can hardly be doubted that\r\nif he had struck on the 15th October, as he did on the 14th February,\r\nthe absence of Mann would not have prevented him from gaining a\r\nvictory which would have dashed the Franco-Spanish naval coalition to\r\npieces. He judged the risk too great, and sailed for Gibraltar on the\r\n2nd November. From Gibraltar he went by order of the Government to\r\nLisbon. We had left the Mediterranean, which was not to see an English\r\nfleet again till the summer of 1798. Lángara, much troubled by gales,\r\nformidable to his unseamanlike fleet, reached Toulon on the 26th\r\nOctober. He left it again on the 1st December with a French squadron of\r\nsix sail under the command of Villeneuve. Lángara put in to Carthagena,\r\nbut the Frenchman went on to Brest. He passed the Straits on the 10th\r\nDecember. Jervis had not yet left for Lisbon, and the French squadron\r\nwas sighted, but could not be pursued. A storm which blew right into\r\nthe anchorage at Gibraltar was raging at the time. One of Jervis’ ships\r\nwas driven on shore, and two were damaged. The admiral could do no\r\nmore than send a frigate home with the news that a French squadron had\r\nescaped from the Mediterranean. Villeneuve went on to Brest. On the\r\n21st December he was seen and chased by the blockading fleet of Admiral\r\nColpoys, but though forced to turn from Brest, he reached L’Orient\r\nsafely on the 23rd. Villeneuve’s was not the only reinforcement\r\nreceived at this time by the French forces in the Channel and the Bay.\r\nRichery, after doing considerable damage in Newfoundland, had reached\r\nthe island of Aix on the 5th of November, and had gone on to Brest\r\nwith part of his squadron. A part, detached on the coast of America,\r\nhad preceded him. Richery was swept into the most determined, and by\r\nfar the most nearly successful, of the efforts made during this war to\r\ninvade the British Isles in force.\r\n\r\nThe very nature of the struggle they had provoked taught the French to\r\ndwell on the hope of delivering the much threatened blow at the heart\r\nwhich was to bring their enemy to the ground. Schemes of invasion\r\nabounded, and may still be read with interest (or amusement) in Captain\r\nDesbrière’s history of _Les Projets et Tentatives de Débarquement aux\r\nÎles Britanniques_ between 1793 and 1805. Some were only foolish.\r\nSome, without ceasing to be foolish, were ferocious. The most notable\r\nof these were the plans for carrying a _chouannerie_ into the British\r\nIsles. A _chouannerie_ was a warfare of atrocious brigandage. It took\r\nits name from the desperate Royalist partisans who, when no longer\r\nable to oppose the Republican armies in the field in Brittany, betook\r\nthemselves to highway robbery, housebreaking, murder and torture of\r\npolitical opponents, or even only of defenceless people who possessed\r\nproperty. As they naturally preferred to act by night and by surprise,\r\nthey were known as the _Chouans_—the brown owls. In the fury of their\r\nhatred the French planned to let loose hundreds of insubordinate\r\nsoldiers and common criminals on the English coast as a measure of\r\nrevenge for the evils which, so they argued, the support given by\r\nEngland to the Royalist partisans had brought upon France. Soldiers\r\nwho were in prison for acts of indiscipline were formed into a corps\r\nunder the name of the _Légion des Francs_. Another corps, aptly\r\nsurnamed the _Légion Noire_, was formed of common criminals. The two\r\nwere to be landed on the English coast to burn, murder, and plunder.\r\nThe calculation made was that France stood to win in any case. If the\r\ntwo legions did murder and pillage, loss would be inflicted on England.\r\nIf the English shot or hanged every man of them, France would be rid of\r\nhundreds of violent blackguards. The calculation was silly, in spite\r\nof its specious air of cunning. The _Chouans_ in Brittany knew the\r\ncountry and the language, and had friends. The legions would have been\r\nperfectly helpless in England—and so they proved in February 1797. In\r\nthat month a French naval expedition of two frigates, a corvette, and\r\na lugger, escaped unobserved from Brest, and landed about 1500 of the\r\n_Légion des Francs_ and the _Légion Noire_ at Fishguard, in Pembroke.\r\nCaptain Castagnier, who commanded the ships, had hardly sailed out\r\nof sight before these intended _Chouans_ with their leader, Tate, a\r\nrascally American adventurer, surrendered to an inferior force of Welsh\r\nmilitiamen under Lord Cawdor. They had no intention of losing their\r\nlives in a frantic attempt to do mere mischief. The English Government\r\nthen called on the French to exchange a number of its English prisoners\r\nfor these cowardly ruffians. When the French refused, they were brought\r\nto their senses by a threat to land the legionaries on the coast of\r\nFrance without exchange. The mere prospect created a panic, and the\r\nBritish Government had its way. The end of the Fishguard invasion was\r\ntherefore that hundreds of useful Englishmen were exchanged against\r\nmen who were a danger and a burden to France, while other hundreds\r\nof honest Frenchmen who were capable of serving their country well\r\nremained in prison for months.\r\n\r\nBefore the Fishguard Invasion ended in sour pleasantry, a more sane and\r\nmanly attack had failed, partly through mismanagement, but to a far\r\ngreater extent because of the protection which the superhuman powers\r\ngoverning this universe have not seldom afforded to England. When the\r\nwar in La Vendée had fairly come to its close by June 1796, the general\r\ncommanding the Republican army, Lazare Hoche, urged that the large\r\narmy of 117,000 men left free by the submission of the Royalists should\r\nbe used for an invasion of the British Isles. His Government was ready\r\nto approve, but for a time it distracted its general by double-minded\r\nschemes. The belief that our empire in India was the cause, and not,\r\nas in truth it was, the consequence, of our strength, was general in\r\nFrance. The French Navy, conscious of its inability to contend with the\r\nconcentrated force of the Royal Navy in the four seas of Britain, and\r\nlonging for the warm seas and abundant prize money of the East, was\r\neager for an expedition to India. So the Government at Paris played\r\nwith dreams of a great expedition to the East Indies which was to drop\r\na body of French troops in Ireland on its way, and the naval officers\r\nat Brest obstructed all other plans. The good sense of Hoche saw that\r\ndivision of aim must be fatal to success, and he at last persuaded\r\nhis superiors to consent to attempt a vigorous invasion of Ireland.\r\nAn invasion of England in force would have inflicted the worse blow,\r\nbut it was rightly judged to be, if not impossible, yet so hazardous\r\nthat it was not entertained. What Castagnier was able to do with four\r\nsmall vessels and a few hundred cut-throats in February 1797, might\r\nconceivably have been done by ten line-of-battle ships and several\r\nthousand good soldiers in 1796. But a Government which was ready to\r\nrisk a few small vessels and a flying column of men whom it would\r\nwillingly have seen at the bottom of the Channel was not disposed to\r\nrun an equal hazard with valuable ships and fine soldiers. An invasion\r\nof Ireland would cause great, perhaps paralysing embarrassment to\r\nEngland. The country was on the verge of rebellion, France was full of\r\nIrish exiles who promised the co-operation of their countrymen. So an\r\ninvasion of Ireland was undertaken.\r\n\r\nAll through the summer preparations were made. The English Government\r\nwas well served by its spies in France. Some of them were among the\r\nIrish exiles. But it could learn nothing definite as to the exact aim\r\nof the invasion which was known to be in preparation. The vacillations\r\nof the French Government served it in one way. No definite information\r\ncould be obtained where no definite plan was adopted. Nothing could be\r\ndone save stand on guard and watch. The measures of defence taken were\r\nsufficient if they had been more effectually applied. A force kept at\r\nabout fifteen sail of the line cruised off Brest. A western squadron\r\nof five, under Curtis, watched beyond the Brest blockade. The grand\r\nfleet, under Bridport, lay at Spithead to support and reinforce. But\r\nSpithead was too difficult to leave against head-winds and too far off\r\nto give an adequate support to the Brest blockade, and the blockade\r\nitself was somewhat slackly kept. Our measures were half measures. We\r\nhad partially dropped Howe’s plan of watch from afar, but had not yet\r\nadopted St. Vincent’s close watch on the spot.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th December 1796 the French expedition drew out from the inner\r\nharbour of Brest to the outer roadstead. Some collisions took place\r\namong the vessels on their way, but they were not more serious than the\r\nsimilar misfortunes which were to befall Bridport’s ships a few days\r\nlater. On the 16th the French fleet was ready to start. It consisted of\r\nseventeen sail of the line, fourteen frigates, two corvettes, one brig,\r\nand three luggers, with transports, and it carried 14,750 soldiers\r\nunder the command of Hoche. The French admirals—Morard de Galle,\r\nBouvet, and Nielly—had hoisted their flags in frigates, which they had\r\nthe option to do; but Richery had his flag in the _Pégase_, 74. Morard\r\nde Galle was with Hoche in the _Fraternité_. The wind was from the\r\neast, the weather frosty and clear. The orders were to steer through\r\nthe Raz du Sein, the southerly passage through the rocks which on that\r\nside bound the roadstead of Brest. This course was adopted in order\r\nto avoid the English blockading force the better. But on the 16th our\r\nships under Admiral Colpoys, who had just taken up the command, were\r\nsome fifty miles away to the west, too far off to strike quickly, with\r\nthe east wind against them—too far off also to be quickly warned by Sir\r\nEdward Pellew, who with his own frigate, the =Indefatigable=, 44, and\r\nothers, was close to the French port. When through the Raz the French\r\nwere to steer for 120 miles W.¼S.W. and then head for Bantry.\r\n\r\nA detailed account of their cruise belongs rather to the history of\r\nthe French than of the English Navy, which, for reasons about to be\r\ngiven, as good as vanished for the next few days. But the fate of the\r\ninvasion cannot be left untold. As the day grew on on the 16th, the\r\nwind drew round to the S.E., and became unfavourable to a fleet passing\r\nthe narrow Raz du Sein. With an unpardonable want of foresight, Morard\r\nde Galle had not provided for this highly probable contingency. So when\r\nhe suddenly decided in the afternoon to take the direct course to the\r\nwest through the wide Iroise, and steered in that direction himself, he\r\nwas followed only by the _Nestor_, 74, and the _Romaine_ and _Cocarde_\r\nfrigates. The rest of the ships either followed Bouvet through the Raz\r\ndu Sein or hesitated and made movements which are now uncertain. One,\r\nthe _Séduisant_, was wrecked on the Grand Stevenec. Pellew, who watched\r\nthe French closely, added to their confusion by false fires and signals\r\nof no meaning. He sent the =Phœbe= frigate to warn Colpoys, and when\r\nassured of the direction the French were taking, went himself in search\r\nof his admiral.\r\n\r\nThe French, therefore, were divided from the beginning, and so\r\nremained. On the 17th Bouvet had with him the vessels which had\r\nfollowed him through the Raz du Sein, eight line-of-battle ships and\r\neight frigates. The wind in drawing round to the S.E. had become\r\nmilder, bringing with it a drizzle of rain and fog. He steered for\r\nBantry, and on the 18th crossed the track of the _Fraternité_ which\r\nwas standing to the south to look for him. Thus the French naval and\r\nmilitary commanders-in-chief went roaming out to the Atlantic, looking\r\nfor their command, which was steering away from them. On the 19th,\r\nBouvet was joined by Nielly and Richery with six sail of the line and\r\ntwo frigates. In variable and gusty winds they pushed on for Bantry.\r\nThe wind was from the west when he sighted Mizen Head on the 21st, but\r\nit swung round to the east, and drove him to leeward of Bantry Bay,\r\nand to the point of Dursey Island. Only eight of the line-of-battle\r\nships and six frigates succeeded in tacking into the bay with Bouvet,\r\nwhere they anchored between Bear Island and the southern side, instead\r\nof going into Beerhaven, between the island and the northern bank,\r\nwhere they would have been safe. The others remained beating to and\r\nfro outside. On the 24th the weather was fine, and there were 6000\r\nsoldiers in the ships with Bouvet. A landing could easily have been\r\neffected, and as there were few troops in the south of Ireland, the\r\nFrench might well have occupied Cork, where lay an immense mass of\r\nmilitary and naval stores. But the command in the absence of Hoche was\r\nin the hands of Grouchy, whose name is associated with a still greater\r\nFrench disaster eighteen years later. He hesitated. No landing was\r\nmade, and on the 25th the wind settled in the east, and blew with fury\r\ndown the bay. Bouvet was forced to sea in his frigate, lost heart, and\r\nmade for Brest, which he reached on the 1st January 1797. Bedout, of\r\nthe _Indomptable_, 80, to whom the command now fell, held on till the\r\n29th, when he too cut his cables and fled seaward before the easterly\r\nwind. All hope was not given up even yet, and some of the French\r\nvessels went to the mouth of the Shannon, which had been named as the\r\nalternative landing-place. They found nothing to do, and so turned\r\nhome to France. Meanwhile the two commanders-in-chief had been groping\r\nfor their commands. The _Fraternité_ had been lost in fog and tossed\r\nin storm. She had sighted the lights of Bouvet, had mistaken them for\r\nthose of an enemy; had turned away; had been chased, compelled to throw\r\nguns overboard to lighten herself for flight, and to alter her course\r\nagain and again; had returned off Bantry Bay on the 29th, only to find\r\nthe _Révolution_, 74, endeavouring to save the crew of the sinking\r\n_Scévola_ frigate, and had finally steered for France. The wrecks of\r\nthe French armament reached home between the 11th and 14th January.\r\n_Afflavit Deus et dissipati sunt._\r\n\r\nOne of the line-of-battle ships carried into Bantry Bay by Bouvet\r\nwas destined not to escape. The _Droits de l’homme_, 74, commanded\r\nby Captain Baron La Crosse, had been among the vessels which went\r\nto the mouth of the Shannon. While cruising there, she captured the\r\n=Cumberland= letter of marque—that is to say, trading-ship, which\r\ncarried a commission authorising her to act as a privateer. The\r\n=Cumberland= had on board thirty soldiers on their way home from the\r\nWest Indies. La Crosse took the English passengers and crew into his\r\nown ship, and sent the =Cumberland= to France with a prize crew. Then\r\nhe headed for home, after looking once more into Bantry. He lost sight\r\nof the Irish coast on the 9th, and on the 13th, in strong westerly\r\nwinds and thick hazy weather, calculated that he was seventy-five\r\nmiles to the west of the Penmarchs. Early in the afternoon two\r\nvessels were seen to windward in the haze, and Captain La Crosse\r\nsteered to the S.E. to avoid them. At about 3.30 two other vessels\r\nwere seen to leeward cutting off his road to France. They were the\r\n=Indefatigable=, 44, Captain Sir Edward Pellew, and the =Amazon=, 36,\r\nCaptain Reynolds. Captain La Crosse had to fight his way home between\r\nthem. In conversation with an English army officer, taken prisoner in\r\nthe =Cumberland=, Lieutenant Pipon, he had declared that he would sink\r\nrather than surrender. His conduct was to show that these were not\r\nwords of idle boasting. The _Droits de l’homme_ was indeed a 74 and\r\nher opponents were frigates, but though one 74 was adjudged more than\r\na match for two frigates, she was at a disadvantage. She was so built\r\nthat her lower deck ports were fourteen French inches—nearly sixteen\r\nEnglish—nearer the water than in other vessels of her class. While\r\nunder a press of sail to throw off the pursuit of the ships seen to\r\nwindward, she lost her fore and maintop. Having no sufficient spread of\r\nsail aloft to steady her she rolled heavily, and the water poured on\r\nto her main-deck. It ran down the cables on the English prisoners who\r\nhad been sent to the cable tier to escape the shot of their friends.\r\nSo Captain La Crosse was not able to make use of the 36-pounders on\r\nhis main deck but had to rely on the 18-pounders and smaller guns of\r\nhis upper decks, firing from a high and most unstable platform. The\r\n_Droits de l’homme_ had in fact the use of a lighter broadside than\r\nthe =Indefatigable=, a very heavy frigate, armed with 24-pounders on\r\nher main deck. Her sole advantage was that she carried 700 soldiers in\r\naddition to her crew, and could replace the 250 casualties she suffered\r\nin the action.\r\n\r\nIt began at 5.30. The _Droits de l’homme_ was steering to the west for\r\nthe coast of France. The =Indefatigable= overtook her, and tried to\r\nrake her. The French captain baffled the attempt, and then Pellew shot\r\nahead, risking and receiving a raking broadside, which did his frigate\r\nlittle harm, and placing himself on the Frenchman’s bow. At a quarter\r\nto seven the =Amazon= came up and took her station on the other bow.\r\nAt 7.30 the two English frigates shot ahead, the =Indefatigable= to\r\nrepair damage to her rigging, the =Amazon=, because the press of sail\r\nshe carried to gain her station had given her so much way that she\r\ncould not stop. Then the action was resumed, to be again suspended to\r\nrepair damage at 10.30 and once more resumed. It lasted through the\r\nnight. The English crews fought with fine manhood and skill, often\r\nup to their waists in water on the main decks. Guns broke from their\r\nfastenings and had to be made secure again—as often as four times. They\r\nwere often filled with water after being loaded, and the charges had to\r\nbe withdrawn before they could be reloaded and safely fired. Repairs\r\nhad to be done in the rigging, and the =Amazon= used up every inch of\r\nspare rope. The Frenchman fought with a heroism which surmounted the\r\nloss of all hope of victory, or even of escape, manœuvring to board\r\nso long as his ship could answer her helm, and always baffled by the\r\nEnglish frigates, which were under perfect control. At 4.30 the moon\r\nbroke through the clouds for a moment, and Lieutenant George Bell,\r\non the forecastle of the =Indefatigable=, saw the land. None of the\r\nthree ships could know where they were. It was only certain that they\r\nwere on a lee-shore, the wind blowing strong and the sea running high.\r\nThe =Indefatigable= was turned to the north, and was followed by the\r\n=Amazon=. Just before daybreak breakers were seen on the lee-bow. The\r\n=Indefatigable= was brought round to the south, but not the =Amazon=\r\nwhich was unmanageable, and was driven on shore. As the =Indefatigable=\r\nstood southward in the first light of day, her crew saw they were in\r\nAudierne Bay, and _Droits de l’homme_ lay on her side in front of\r\nPloxevet with the sea breaking over her. Her mizen-mast, the lower\r\nforemast, and bowsprit had gone. The cable of the only anchor she had\r\nleft was cut by English shot, and after a manful effort to reeve a new\r\none had been made, and the anchor had failed to hold, she drove ashore.\r\nThe position of the =Indefatigable= was terrible, for her one chance\r\nof escape was to round the Penmarchs at the south point of Audierne\r\nBay, and she was damaged. But her crew and officers showed “their full\r\nvalue,” as their captain gratefully acknowledged. She cleared the rocks\r\nand gained the open sea.\r\n\r\nThe _Droits de l’homme_ lay without possibility of help, for two\r\ndays, in the breakers, and two more passed before the last survivors\r\nwere taken from the wreck. The story may be read in the narrative of\r\nLieutenant Pipon. The English prisoners were called up from the cable\r\ntier with the cry _Pauvres anglais! Pauvres anglais! Montes Bien vite.\r\nNous sommes tous perdus_. When the boats were lowered some women and\r\nchildren, who were among the English prisoners, were given the first\r\nchance of escape. But the boats were shattered alongside, and they\r\nall perished. The _Droits de l’homme_ lay breaking up, and the crew\r\nperished slowly, one brave man, the sailmaker, Lamende, nearly lost his\r\nlife in an attempt to swim ashore with a line, and an army officer who\r\nfollowed him was drowned. The English worked manfully in the common\r\ncause, one of them, a merchant skipper, going over the side fourteen\r\ntimes to save the people in the boats. They could get neither food\r\nnor fresh water. The pangs of hunger can be outlived but not those\r\nof thirst. Many drank urine and salt water and went mad. Of the 380\r\nwho remained on the wreck on the fourth night half were dead in the\r\nmorning. The French Government released the English prisoners freely,\r\nand gave several of them rewards in money. The shipwrecked crew of the\r\n=Amazon= were well treated. La Crosse survived and was promoted. The\r\nloss of the _Droits de l’homme_ was an incident in a campaign, but\r\nskill and manhood, heroism, humanity, and devotion to duty are noble\r\nand immortal things. We cannot look at them too carefully or too long.\r\n\r\nIn all these events fortune had a great share, but excepting the\r\nactivity of a few frigates, the Royal Navy had little part. When\r\nAdmiral Colpoys heard from the captain of the =Phœbe= that the French\r\nwere at sea, his fleet was in want of stores, and he knew not where\r\nthe enemy was gone. So he bore up for Spithead, and, dropping part\r\nof his ships at the western ports on the way, reached it on the 31st\r\nDecember with six sail. Bridport, urged to get quickly to sea when the\r\nGovernment learnt that the French were out, had started on the 25th,\r\nfour days after Bouvet reached Bantry. But he met difficulties. The\r\n=Prince= ran into the =Sans-Pareil=, and the =Formidable= into the\r\n=Ville de Paris=. The =Atlas= grounded. Then he was stopped in a gale,\r\nand he did not sail with his fourteen ships of the line till the 3rd\r\nJanuary 1797. He cruised about, from Ushant to Cape Clear, chased\r\nthe much chased _Fraternité_ on the 9th, and intercepted nothing. He\r\nwas fifty-seven miles west of Ushant when the last of the returning\r\nFrench ships entered Brest. Before he returned to Spithead on the 3rd\r\nFebruary, he detached Rear-Admiral Sir W. Parker to join Jervis with\r\nthe =Prince George=, =Namur=, =Irresistible=, =Orion=, =Colossus=, and\r\n=Thalia= frigate. They were to be usefully employed, for it was this\r\nreinforcement which enabled Jervis to fight the battle of Cape St.\r\nVincent.\r\n\r\nThe five line-of-battle ships and the frigate were sent to join Jervis\r\nat his rendezvous at Cape St. Vincent in fulfilment of a promise that\r\nthe squadron carried off by Mann should be replaced, and his force\r\nbrought up again to twenty sail. They served to bring him up to the\r\nfifteen he had had a few weeks before they joined him on the 6th\r\nFebruary. The =Courageux=, 80, had been lost, and the =Gibraltar=, 80,\r\ndriven on the Pearl Rock during the furious gale of the 10th December,\r\nin which Villeneuve escaped from the Mediterranean. Shortly after\r\nJervis left Gibraltar for Lisbon on the 16th December, the =Zealous=,\r\n74, struck on a rock in Tangier Bay, and was badly damaged. As he\r\nentered Lisbon on the 21st, the =Bombay Castle=, 74, ran ashore and was\r\nlost. When he left it on the 18th January to escort a Portuguese convoy\r\nout of danger and to observe the Spaniards, the =St. George=, 98, after\r\nrunning into and dismasting a Portuguese frigate, grounded heavily on\r\nthe great Cachop. His command had therefore been brought down to ten by\r\nthe 6th February. To complete the tale it may be added that the fifteen\r\nwere nearly reduced to fourteen or even thirteen while it was still\r\ndark on the morning of the 12th, when the =Culloden=, 74, ran into the\r\n=Colossus=, 74, because the second, after holding her wind too long\r\nwhile the fleet was tacking in succession, suddenly bore up across the\r\nbows of the first, and tore her fore-rigging badly.[3] The energy of\r\nCaptain Troubridge of the =Culloden= brought his ship quickly into\r\ntrim, and she took a leading part in the coming battle.\r\n\r\nLángara had been superseded by Don José de Córdoba at Carthagena, and\r\nthe Spanish fleet under its new admiral came on in pursuit of a wild\r\nscheme to sail to Brest, join the French ships there, now under the\r\ncommand of Villeneuve, then join a Dutch force in the Texel and renew\r\nthe attempted invasion of England. The scheme was wild on many grounds,\r\nbut particularly because of the utter want of quality in the Spanish\r\nfleet. It has already been said, when speaking of the American War,\r\nthat the Spanish Government had endeavoured to form a great fleet by\r\nbuilding more ships than it could afford, and had never had money to\r\nspend on training officers and men. Every evil it suffered from in 1779\r\nhad been intensified under the imbecile government of King Charles IV.\r\nA mass of fine ships was heaped up, but they were manned with crews\r\nwhich hardly included a tenth of seamen, and commanded by officers who\r\nhad had little practice. Nothing had been done to improve it since the\r\nwars began in 1793. On the contrary, neglect, failure to pay or even\r\nfeed the men, made the service odious, and it grew even worse. The best\r\nofficer in the Spanish navy, Jose Mazaredo, had refused to take the\r\ncommand unless the Government bound itself to commission no more ships\r\nthan it could man. He had been arrested, to punish him for questioning\r\nthe wisdom of his superiors. Every officer in the Spanish fleet knew\r\nits unfitness to meet the English.\r\n\r\nEvery English officer knew its weaknesses too, and nobody better than\r\nJervis. He was aware that the narrow failure of the invasion of Ireland\r\nhad shaken the nerve of the country. The discontent in the fleet, which\r\nwas just about to break into mutiny, was not unknown to him. A victory\r\nwas very necessary to England. A weak man would have looked to numbers\r\nalone, and would have been cautious. Jervis looked to the quality of\r\nthe enemy, and the greatness of the crisis. He saw how much better it\r\nwould be that every one of his fifteen ships should go to the bottom if\r\nonly she could take a Spaniard with her, than that Córdoba should reach\r\nBrest. Therefore as Hood sailed from Antigua resolved to fight Grasse,\r\nbe his number what they might, so Jervis waited at Cape St. Vincent,\r\nresolute to give battle whatever numbers the Spaniards might bring\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 13th February he was joined by the =Minerva=,\r\n36, which had just sighted the Spaniards, and had been chased by\r\nthem. Nelson had been sent up the Mediterranean in her to bring away\r\nSir Gilbert Elliot from Porto Ferrajo, whither he had retired after\r\nthe evacuation of Corsica. He now hoisted his commodore’s pennant\r\nin the =Captain=, 74. At four in the afternoon the signal was made\r\nto clear for action, and during the night the fleet remained under\r\nreduced canvas, keeping its post of watch. The signal guns of the\r\nSpaniards were heard at half-past one on the morning of the 14th, and\r\nat half-past two, a Scotchman, Captain Campbell, in the Portuguese\r\nservice, who commanded the _Carlotta_ frigate, spoke the flagship, and\r\ninformed Jervis that the Spaniards were fifteen miles to windward—that\r\nis, to the west of him. Daylight came on the 14th with fresh breezes\r\nfrom the west and a thick haze. At six, reefs were shaken out and\r\nthe search for the enemy began. By seven, strange sails were seen in\r\nthe haze to the S.S.W. stretching across our route to the S.E. The\r\nreconnoitring frigates and sloops reported their numbers, which were\r\ndiscovered to be greater as the air cleared. At 8.20 the signal was\r\nmade to prepare for battle, and at 9.20 the =Culloden=, =Blenheim=,\r\nand =Prince George= were ordered to chase. When at 9.47 the =Bonne\r\nCitoyenne= sloop reported seeing more vessels to the S.W., the\r\n=Irresistible= and =Colossus= were ordered to join in the chase. The\r\n=Orion= joined without orders and was not recalled. About ten the air\r\ncleared, and the two fleets were fully revealed to one another.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were aware of the approach of Jervis, and two of their\r\nlook-out frigates had actually seen part of his ships, but they\r\nunderestimated his strength. Their national carelessness, intensified\r\nperhaps by the desperation of men who knew they were devoted to a\r\nhopeless task, was never more conspicuous. Their ships were wandering\r\nin two confused shoals, one of nineteen sail was to windward and\r\nwestward of the English, another of six was to leeward and eastward.\r\nThe two were trying to join, but there was a wide interval between\r\nthem. A twenty-sixth Spaniard was seen outside the windward division,\r\nand a twenty-seventh was coming up from leeward. Jervis at once headed\r\nfrom the open space between the two divisions. At 10.57 the order was\r\ngiven to form in a line of battle ahead and astern of the flagship as\r\nmost convenient.\r\n\r\nAs the ships fell in to their places the line was formed thus:—\r\n\r\n =Culloden=        74   T. Troubridge.\r\n\r\n =Blenheim=        90   T. L. Frederich.\r\n\r\n =Prince George=   98  { Rear-Admiral W. Parker.\r\n                       { T. Irwin.\r\n\r\n =Orion=           74   Sir J. Saumarez.\r\n\r\n =Irresistible=    74   G. Martin.\r\n\r\n =Colossus=        74   G. Murray.\r\n\r\n                       { Admiral Sir J. Jervis.\r\n =Victory=        100  { Captain-of-Fleet R. Calder.\r\n                       { Flag-Captain G. Grey\r\n\r\n =Barfleur=        98  { Vice-Admiral W. Waldegrave.\r\n                       { J. R. Dacres.\r\n\r\n =Goliath=         74   Sir C. H. Knowles.\r\n\r\n =Egmont=          74   J. Sutton.\r\n\r\n =Britannia=      100  { Vice-Admiral Thompson.\r\n                       { T. Foley.\r\n\r\n =Namur=           90   J. Whitshed.\r\n\r\n =Captain=         94  { Commodore Nelson.\r\n                       {    \"    Miller.\r\n\r\n =Diadem=          64   G. H. Towry.\r\n\r\n =Excellent=       74   C. Collingwood.\r\n\r\nThe manifest confusion of the enemy, added to their knowledge of his\r\nwant of discipline, gave the British seamen a boundless confidence.\r\nHis numbers were naught, and Jervis’s men could dismiss that vain\r\nshow in the spirit of Alaric’s scoffing answer to the threats of the\r\nRomans, “The thicker the hay the better the mowing.” There were fine\r\nships in the Spanish fleet, there was personal courage which might have\r\nbeen trained to efficiency, there were some officers who could have\r\nhandled good instruments if they had had them. There was nothing else.\r\nTherefore as the naval historian, James, puts it with more than his\r\nusual liveliness, our seamen “rattled through the business, more as if\r\nit were a game of harmless sport, than one in which the hazard thrown\r\nwas for life or death.”\r\n\r\nIt was half-past eleven when the =Culloden= opened fire, and by midday\r\nthe head of the line had cut into the gap between the disorderly shoals\r\nof Spaniards. If it had stood on it would have passed, and the enemy\r\nwould have been free to unite behind it. At 12.8 Jervis signalled the\r\norder to tack, and the =Culloden= came round to fall on the rear of the\r\nSpaniards who were huddled to windward heading to the north to pass\r\nour line as it went south. The =Blenheim= and =Prince George= tacked\r\nin succession to follow the =Culloden=. Tacking in succession was not\r\nonly a slow movement, but if it had been carried out the fleet must\r\nhave fallen behind the weather division of the Spaniards. To keep them\r\npermanently divided our line should have turned together, or should\r\nhave begun to turn in succession from the rear. At about 1 o’clock the\r\nSpaniards had passed down our line to the rear. Their lee division\r\nmade a feeble effort at 12.30 to break through the line ahead of the\r\n=Victory=, and join the ships to windward. Their road was barred,\r\nand they were headed off in confusion by her heavy fire. One only\r\npassed down the line to leeward—it was supposed she was the _Oriente_,\r\n74—exchanged broadsides with the closing ship, the =Excellent=, and\r\njoined the main body. As she passed the rear she was fired into by our\r\nfrigates which were in their station to rear and to leeward of the\r\nline, and returned their fire without doing them any harm.\r\n\r\nSo far there was nothing to show that the battle would differ very\r\nmaterially from many previous encounters of fleets passing in opposite\r\ndirections. It would not have differed if literal obedience had been\r\npaid to the signal made by Jervis at 12.51—“To take suitable stations,\r\nand engage as arrive up in succession,” which implied that the ships\r\nwere to continue following one another. But just before, or just at,\r\nor just after this moment,[4] Nelson made a movement which altered\r\nthe whole character of the battle. He brought the =Captain= round on\r\nher keel, passed astern of the =Diadem=, the vessel next behind him,\r\nand ahead of the =Excellent=. Then he threw himself ahead of the\r\nSpaniards, who were trying to pass the rear of the line, and turned\r\nthem off. He turned his ship from being the third from the rear into\r\nbeing the first of the van, for as he came round he fell on the enemy\r\nahead of the =Culloden=. The =Captain= was hotly pressed, but was\r\nrelieved first by the =Culloden= then by the =Blenheim=, which passed\r\nbetween her and the enemy, and pushed on. Other vessels turned and came\r\nup to press on the enemy. The rear ships of the line did not follow the\r\nexample of the =Captain= till Jervis, who had tacked the =Victory=,\r\nand was standing to the north, ordered them to do so. All then fell\r\non the retreating Spaniards, of whom four were taken. Meanwhile the\r\nenemy to leeward had worked to windward, formed a line, and came up\r\nto support the main body, falling into position to rear of it. Jervis\r\ncalled his ships together to cover his prizes, and the battle ceased at\r\nfive o’clock. The circumstances of the capture of two of these prizes,\r\nthe _San Josef_ and _San Nicolas_, which were boarded and captured by\r\nNelson, are famous, but the details belong to his biography.\r\n\r\nSt. Vincent was a famous victory, and, moreover, it was a most timely\r\none. Therefore the joy it caused in England was thoroughly justified,\r\nand Jervis nobly earned his earldom. It may seem ungracious to make\r\nreservations, and yet some independence of judgment may be exercised\r\neven on Jervis. When we have fully recognised the political courage he\r\nshowed in giving battle when he would not have been blamed for caution,\r\nand for the strength of mind which enabled him to scorn vain shows, we\r\nare free to ask whether the actual fighting of the battle on his part,\r\nand the use made of it, justify us in thinking him “a great captain.”\r\nI venture to suggest that they do not. But for the independence of\r\nNelson the battle might well have ended in a passage on opposite tacks\r\nand an artillery duel. On the day following the battle he was in sight\r\nof twenty-three Spaniards, and he was content to cover his prizes. In\r\nhis fleet only the =Captain= had been seriously injured, and the loss\r\nacknowledged was only 300 men. He is reported to have said that if the\r\nenemy came on he would have burnt his prizes—but why not burn them\r\nand attack? He was between the Spaniards and Cadiz, and could have\r\nforced on a battle. Their quality being what it was he could surely\r\nhave destroyed them utterly. Much has been said of Rodney’s failure to\r\nfollow up his victory on the 12th April 1782. We have heard a great\r\ndeal of Howe’s weakness on the 1st of June. Everyone has laughed at\r\nHotham, who was too much at ease in Zion, and has applauded Nelson’s\r\nimpatience with his easy-going ways. Yet Jervis cuddled his prizes as\r\ntenderly as ever did Rodney, Howe, or Hotham. Four was a small part\r\nof twenty-seven. Still Nelson said nothing, and Jervis stands as a\r\nmonument of energy. But Nelson was too busy glorying in his triumph,\r\nand claiming to have done more than the fine thing he actually had\r\ndone, even at the expense of brother officers—(witness his acrid tone\r\nto Parker, who called his attention to the fact that the =Captain= had\r\nbeen early and well supported by the =Prince George=)—and Jervis was a\r\nbully. The Spaniards were allowed to reach Cadiz, and Jervis went to\r\nLagos, where he began a new series of operations.\r\n\r\nThe battle of St. Vincent had ruined the left wing of the great\r\ncombined Spanish-French-Dutch army of invasion. The French, though as\r\nresolute as ever to invade, were not ready so soon after the failure\r\nof Morard de Galle to make another attempt. For the rest of the year,\r\ntherefore, the first part fell to the Dutch fleet. Since Holland\r\nhad been overrun by the French armies at the close of 1794, and had\r\nestablished the Batavian Republic in February 1795, the Dutch had had\r\nmany reasons to regret the change. Their French friends fleeced them at\r\nhome, and England occupied their colonies and swept their trade off the\r\nsea.[5] Although the French had dragged Holland into war with England,\r\nthe hostility of the Dutch was strong and spontaneous. They fretted\r\nunder the dictation of the French, but they had an active hatred of\r\nEngland, which, after joining with Prussia to impose the rule of the\r\nStadtholder on them by force in 1786, had dragged him into war with\r\nFrance, had failed to give him effective military support, and when the\r\ncountry was overrun by France had at once—on the 19th January—begun\r\nto embargo Dutch ships and cargoes lest they should fall into French\r\nhands. We acted with reluctance and under the pressure of necessity,\r\nbut the Dutch, who lost the goods, attributed our action to greed and\r\nmalignity.\r\n\r\nTherefore they entered readily enough into schemes for invading\r\nEngland, but still with caution. They refused to ship French troops\r\nin the fleet they prepared in the Texel, being afraid of their\r\nallies. The French co-operation was dropped for this, and for other\r\nreasons. The French Government of the day was very jealous of its\r\nmost famous generals, and at that moment of Hoche in particular. It\r\nwould gladly have seen him sail in search of glory on any venture, the\r\nmore desperate the better. The general, who perfectly understood the\r\nreal meaning of all this tender care for his glory—ended by declaring\r\nthat he would not play Don Quixote on the sea for the benefit of men\r\nwho would gladly see him at the bottom of it. The combined Dutch\r\nand French army of invasion dwindled into a purely Dutch army, and\r\nfinally disappeared altogether. Daendaels, the general who was to\r\nhave commanded it, had an hereditary Dutch understanding of maritime\r\nthings, and he saw that the preliminary to an invasion of England was\r\nthe defeat of the English fleet in the North Sea. But it was not till\r\nOctober 1797 that the Batavian Republic ordered its naval forces to act.\r\n\r\nThe command of the English fleet in the North Sea was given to Adam\r\nDuncan, then vice-admiral, who was soon afterwards promoted to admiral.\r\nDuncan had been a follower of Keppel’s, was commonly known as Keppel’s\r\nDuncan, and was by common consent an excellent officer. He had been\r\nlong unemployed, and it may be the case that he owed his appointment to\r\nthe command in the North Sea, not only to his reputation as an officer\r\nand seaman, but to the fact that he was closely connected by marriage\r\nwith Dundas, afterwards Lord Melville, who held the vitally important\r\npost of general manager of corruption, and distributor of patronage in\r\nPitt’s ministry. When he took up his command he had but four ships of\r\nthe line with him. It is true that he had the co-operation of a Russian\r\nsquadron, but it was in a most inefficient state, and proved of small\r\nvalue. In fact it embarrassed our squadron, for it was in incessant\r\nneed of stores and repairs, while the necessity to flatter the touchy\r\nvanity of our ally, the Russian Government, compelled us to treat\r\nit with much respect. Duncan had to struggle with even another and a\r\nworse defect, which is very exactly indicated in a letter written to\r\nhim in August 1796, by Sir C. Middleton, afterwards Lord Barham, one\r\nof the Commissioners for the navy, who wrote: “My own wish is to have\r\nyour force very strong, but I plainly perceive, from the many irons we\r\nhave in the fire, that I shall be overruled. The same cause obliges\r\nus to employ your frigates on many extra services, and which I have\r\ncharged the secretary to acquaint you with as often as it happens; but\r\nnecessary as this information is for your guidance, I am afraid it is\r\noften forgot.”\r\n\r\nThe best ships were taken for the Brest blockade, the Channel, the\r\nMediterranean. Duncan’s own flagship, the =Venerable=, 74, leaked\r\ncontinually, and was only kept in service by endless care. It is\r\ntherefore not to be wondered at that in February 1796 two Dutch\r\nsquadrons, commanded by Braak and Lucas, succeeded in escaping from the\r\nNorth Sea to the West Indies and the Cape. During the middle of 1797\r\nDuncan’s troubles were enormously increased by the mutiny at the Nore,\r\nwhich will be dealt with in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd October Duncan, who had been cruising for eighteen weeks,\r\nwas compelled to return to Yarmouth for stores with the bulk of\r\nhis fleet, leaving Captain Henry Trollope with the =Russell=, 74,\r\n=Adamant=, 50, and several frigates and smaller vessels to watch the\r\nTexel. On the 7th the Dutch came out under the command of Jan Willem de\r\nWinter, who had been trained as a naval officer, had gone into exile in\r\n1786, had served in the French Republican armies, and was a general in\r\nthe army as well as vice-admiral in the fleet. His fleet consisted of\r\nthe\r\n\r\n                      { Vice-Admiral de\r\n _Vryheid_        94  {   Winter.\r\n                      { Capt. van Rossern.\r\n\r\n _Jupiter_        94  { Vice-Admiral Reuntjes.\r\n                      { Rear-Admiral Menses.\r\n\r\n _Brutus_         74  { Rear-Admiral Bloys.\r\n                      { Capt. van Treslong.\r\n\r\n _States General_ 74   Rear-Admiral Storij.\r\n\r\n _Cerberus_       64   Capt.

As De Winter was known to\r\nbe heading to the south, and the wind was northerly, ranging from N.E.\r\nto N.W. and W. by N., Duncan stood over the North Sea from Yarmouth to\r\nthe Texel, to put himself between De Winter and his port, and to gain\r\nthe weather-gage, which gave him the means of forcing on a battle.\r\nThe Dutch, well observed by our look-out vessels to whose crews they\r\nappeared to be somewhat awkwardly handled, stood over to Lowestoft, and\r\nthen returned to their own coast. They were seen at about half-past\r\neight on the morning of the 11th October by our fleet, which was coming\r\ndown from the north with the wind at W. by N.\r\n\r\nThe ships with Duncan were—\r\n\r\n =Venerable=    74   { Admiral Duncan.\r\n                     { Capt. W. G. Fairfax.\r\n\r\n =Monarch=      74   { Vice-Admiral R. Onslow.\r\n                     { Capt. E. O’Brien.\r\n\r\n =Russel=       74      \"    H.

Essington.\r\n =Belliqueux=   64      \"    J. Inglis.\r\n =Agincourt=    64      \"    J. Williamson.\r\n =Lancaster=    64      \"    J.

Hotham.\r\n\r\nwith eight frigates and small vessels.\r\n\r\nElaborate comparisons have been made to show that one fleet was\r\nstronger than the other, but they are idle in view of the simple fact\r\nthat some of the English did not come into action, and some of the\r\nDutch got out of it sooner than was becoming. Physical obstructions and\r\nfortune played a part—and every man who wears a blue coat is not a hero.\r\n\r\nAs Duncan came down in pursuit his ships were scattered, the best\r\nsailors in front, the worst behind. It would have been possible to\r\nunite them all, only by causing the more advanced ships to lie to till\r\nthe laggards came up. At eleven the advanced ships did shorten sail to\r\nunite the fleet. But the Dutch, who were in a line heading from S.W.\r\nto N.E., with their heads towards the Texel, were gradually drawing\r\ntowards their own coast. Camperdown, in North Holland, was about nine\r\nmiles from them. Delay on Duncan’s part would have given them a chance\r\nto slip off to the Texel. Therefore his plan for fighting the battle\r\nwas not, and could not, be carried out. His intention was to form his\r\nfleet on the starboard line of bearing, which, with the wind at W. by\r\nN., would be a line from S.W. to N.E. parallel to the Dutch. Then he\r\nmeant to act as Howe had meant to do on the 1st June, break through the\r\nenemy from windward to leeward, all along from van to rear. As the day\r\nwore on towards the early dark of October and the Dutch drew nearer\r\nthe land, the impatience of Duncan, which was patent to his officers,\r\ngrew beyond control. He renounced all attempt to form a line, ordered\r\nOnslow, who was to the south and leeward of him, to break through the\r\nenemy’s rear, and the whole fleet to break through. Then first Onslow,\r\nand next the admiral went down on the enemy, setting an example to the\r\nships about them. Duncan, an old friend and correspondent of Clerk, was\r\npenetrated with his confidence that the proper policy for an English\r\nfleet was to break into the enemy’s formation and produce a mêlée.\r\nMoreover, we have his actions to prove how well he understood that\r\nwhatever the fate of the English ships was to be, the country would be\r\nserved if the Dutch were left in no condition to invade for the next\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\nThe battle began at 12.40, and at 3 it ended. The two hours and a half\r\nwhile it lasted were the hottest hours of battle in the whole war. The\r\nDutch were awkward in fleet manœuvres from want of practice, but they\r\nwere more phlegmatic, more solid, better gunners, and better ropemen\r\nthan the French. They reserved their fire till our ships were close,\r\nand their two first broadsides, as English officers experienced them\r\nconfessed, “were terrible.” Onslow, who cut through the line astern\r\nof the Dutch between the _Jupiter_ and the _Haarlem_, and Duncan, who\r\ncut the line behind the _States General_, were both heavily pounded,\r\nand so were the vessels which followed them. If there was final\r\nconcentration of English ships on the Dutch centre and rear, there\r\nhad been a preliminary concentration of Dutch ships on the English\r\nleaders. Three vessels lost more than a hundred men each. The =Ardent=,\r\n64, which belonged to Duncan’s division and was closely engaged with\r\nthe _Vryheid_, lost no less than 148 killed and wounded—more than a\r\nthird of her crew. Her captain, Burgess, and her master, Don, were\r\nboth slain. The total loss was officially stated to be 825, but the\r\ncommittee appointed to distribute a public subscription for the wounded\r\nand the families of the dead put it at 1040. The eleven Dutch ships\r\ntaken were so shattered as to be of no further use. Admiral De Winter\r\nwas taken prisoner. The ships in the Dutch van escaped too soon, after\r\ndoing too little to help the others. On our side all did not come\r\nequally well into action. Captain John Williamson, of the =Agincourt=,\r\nhad hung about the outskirts of the fight in a very feeble way. In\r\n1779 he had been a lieutenant with Captain Cook, and had witnessed the\r\nmurder of his commander from a launch, not only without attempting to\r\nsave him, but without attempting to rescue his body. He was brought to\r\na court martial and, though acquitted of cowardice, was sentenced to be\r\nput at the bottom of the list of post-captains for misconduct.\r\n\r\nNelson once complained that actions fought near home were more thought\r\nof than those fought far off. Camperdown is an exception to the rule—if\r\nrule there be. It was early half forgotten, and is much neglected among\r\nour battles. Yet it was a great deliverance from fear of invasion at\r\nthe time, and the quality of the enemy we conquered must place it far\r\nabove St. Vincent as a battle. At Trafalgar a far better appointed\r\nfleet than Duncan’s fought a much less formidable enemy, on the same\r\nmethod as he fought the Dutch. Much pedantry has been expended in\r\ninquiring whether both admirals did or did not alter their first\r\nplans—as if it could ever be a reproach to a leader of men that he\r\nadapted his actions to the circumstances. That Duncan did not waste\r\ntime in forming the starboard line of bearing, and thereby give the\r\nDutch an opportunity to slip away, is manifestly true—and to a plain\r\nman it appears that he did alter his plan. Nelson at Trafalgar may have\r\ndone what he had meant to do all along, but he had Duncan’s battle to\r\nshow the advantage of doing it. Yet Duncan is commonly spoken of to-day\r\nas a brave old fellow who blundered on a victory, and nobody has noted\r\nhow little originality was required in 1805 to do what had been already\r\ndone in 1797. I know of no reason why Duncan is not to be credited with\r\nsense enough to foresee, and intend, the consequences of his acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE MUTINIES\r\n\r\n AUTHORITIES.—In addition to the general histories and biographies\r\n     of officers named already, two pamphlets ought to be consulted\r\n     for the mutinies. _A Narrative of Occurrences which took\r\n     place during the Mutiny at the Nore in May and June 1797_, by\r\n     Rear-Admiral Charles Cunningham, 1829; and _The Natural Defence\r\n     of an Insular Empire_, by Admiral Phillip Paton, 1810.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year of St. Vincent and Camperdown was also the year of the great\r\nmutinies which mark a turning-point in the history of the navy. They\r\nwere the culmination of long-standing grievances caused by old evils.\r\n\r\nIf we could reconstruct a crew (supposing the thing to have been done\r\nfairly and without beautifying), the spectacle would surprise, and\r\nsomewhat disenchant, the spectator. To do it fairly we must take not\r\na crack frigate commanded by a popular officer with a good reputation\r\nfor luck in prize-taking, but one of the ordinary vessels, liners or\r\nless, which did the bulk of the heavy work of the old wars. If the\r\ndate chosen had been well on in any of our naval wars, and certainly\r\nif it had been taken in the midst of the last and greatest, the\r\nfigures of wax or wood—which we suppose to be properly ticketed—would\r\ntell a curious tale. It would be startling to see how many foreigners\r\nthere were, how many landsmen, how many boys, how many quota-men, and\r\nstate-the-case-men. The quota-men were those whom each county of the\r\nUnited Kingdom was called upon at one period in the old war to supply\r\nfor the fleet. Of course they all came from the Cave of Adullam, and\r\nwere, in fact, the scamps of every neighbourhood, tempted by high\r\nbounties. Their character is sufficiently well indicated by the fact\r\nthat Parker, who headed the mutiny at the Nore, was a quota-man from\r\nPerth. The state-the-case-man is more complicated. As the press-gang\r\nswept all fish into its net, a great many were seized who were, or\r\nbelieved themselves to be, exempted. They were for ever appealing to\r\nthe Admiralty for release, and the Department kept writing to the\r\ncaptains about them. For convenience, these letters were marked outside\r\n“State the case.” Hence the expression a “state-the-case-man,” as\r\napplied to the poor forced complaining creatures, of whom every captain\r\nwould have been delighted to get rid, if only he could have kept his\r\ncomplement up without them. Of such material our crews were largely\r\nformed in the most triumphant times; for the navy was not popular\r\nwith the real sailors, and least of all with the best. Although the\r\nprime men who were the real nerve of a crew were supposed to form a\r\nthird only of the complement, they contributed more to the list of\r\ndeserters than the ordinary seamen, landsmen, boys, and marines put\r\ntogether. Every ship carried a proportion of landsmen, who were not\r\nexpected to do real sailor’s work. This perversity of the seamen was a\r\nsore grievance to officers. Admiral Cunningham, who was captain of the\r\nfrigate =Clyde= during the mutiny at the Nore, and wrote an account\r\nof it, was very severe on them. He thought that they were as happy\r\nas mortal sailor could expect to be. But they were of another way of\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nThis wrongheadedness of theirs, too, was an old story—as old as the\r\nseventeenth century—and, in spite of Admiral Cunningham, was thoroughly\r\nintelligible. It was a question of pay, both in amount and manner. As\r\nfar back as the reign of William III., Captain Saint-Lo put the whole\r\nthing into a nutshell. The wages of A.B.’s were then 23s. a month for\r\na month of twenty-eight days, which is 25s. a month on the year. This\r\nrate of pay remained unchanged, in spite of the fall in the value of\r\nmoney, till the mutiny at Spithead scared Parliament into greater, but\r\nstill very measured, liberality. Now in Captain Saint-Lo’s time the\r\naverage wages of a good man in the merchant service during war were\r\n50s. and 60s. a month. In the eighteenth century they were known to\r\ngo as high as £4. The men who manned the coal-ships in the North Sea\r\nearned as much as £6, £7, or £8 the run. Here was a contrast which the\r\nA.B. naturally perpended. But what had equal, or even greater, weight\r\nwith him was the reflection that, whereas a man in the merchant service\r\nwas sure of his money at the end of the voyage, the man-of-war’s man\r\ncould never know when he would be paid. Admiral Cunningham quoted\r\nas one of the blessings of the sailors that the Admiralty had done\r\nall human wisdom could do to see that each man got exactly his right\r\namount; but, unluckily, it was precisely the fatherly care of “My\r\nLords” which constituted the grievance. The treatment given to the\r\nseamen had indeed been improved in the course of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. In 1758, George Grenville, who was then Treasurer of the Navy,\r\npersuaded Parliament to pass “an Act for the Encouragement of Seamen\r\nemployed in the Royal Navy; and for establishing a regular method\r\nfor the punctual, frequent, and certain payment of their wages; and\r\nfor enabling them more easily and readily to remit the same for the\r\nsupport of their wives and families; and for preventing frauds and\r\nabuses attending such payments.” But these fine promises of the title\r\nof the Act were spoilt by many limitations. A man who volunteered was\r\nto receive an advance of two months, and could assign part of his\r\npay for the support of his family. All men who had served for a year\r\nand upwards were entitled to be paid the wages due to them (less a\r\ndeduction of six months, which was kept back as a guarantee against\r\ndesertion) whenever the ship they were in came into a home port where\r\nthere was a Commissioner of the Navy. But pressed men got no advance,\r\nand none of the men were paid when serving abroad, or at a home port\r\nother than a naval dockyard. The deduction of six months was calculated\r\nin a way which the sailors complained of. Their wages were paid by\r\nmonths of four weeks, but the deductions were made in calendar months.\r\n\r\nIn practice the men got their wages not in hard coin on board, but\r\nin pay-tickets, which had to be presented at an office, and were\r\nonly cashed when all the red tape had been duly complied with. As a\r\nship’s commission in war-time might last four years, we can easily\r\nimagine what this might mean for a man who had been pressed out of a\r\nhome-coming merchant-ship at the beginning of hostilities, and also\r\nwhat it meant for his wretched wife and family. But even this was not\r\nall. It frequently happened, when there was great need to keep fleets\r\nat sea, that when a ship was “paid off” and her crew had received\r\ntheir “tickets,” they were bodily turned over to a fresh ship, with\r\ntheir paper money in their hands, and sent off on another four years’\r\ncruise. Admiral Ekins, who wrote after the great war, when something\r\nhad been done for the men, says that he heard of a case of one who had\r\nserved fourteen years without touching a penny of actual pay. This\r\nhe gives as mere report; but he adds that, to his own knowledge, men\r\noften served nine years without the receipt of wages. After that, one\r\nunderstands what Nelson meant when he said that his heart was with\r\nthe men who mutinied at Spithead. After all, their main demands were\r\nthat their pay should be raised above the figure fixed in Charles\r\nII.’s time, when money was worth twice what it was in 1797, and\r\nthat they should be paid whenever a ship returned to England—which\r\nassuredly were moderate requests. The practical results of the old\r\nsystem were horrible. For one thing, as the men had to buy their\r\nclothes, they were actually reduced to nakedness and rags for want\r\nof money. When a crew were turned over in the style described above,\r\nthe Jews (by race or occupation) were allowed on board. To them the\r\nsailors sold their tickets at the price they were likely to get in a\r\nforced market. On these occasions a certain latitude was allowed by\r\nthe humanity of officers. Liquor was winked at, and the “wives” of\r\nthe sailors were allowed on board. The scenes which followed on the\r\nmess decks reproduced the animalism of the South Sea Islands without\r\nthe picturesqueness. But it was not only by the “Jews,” and on board,\r\nthat the unfortunate sailor was pillaged. William Hodges, who in 1695\r\nmade a pathetic representation of their grievances to Parliament,\r\ndraws a dreadful picture of the misery inflicted on the whole class\r\nby the monstrous system on which they were paid. Hodges does not\r\nmeasure his language, and was plainly one of those good men in whom\r\nzeal for justice has eaten up moderation; but his statements are too\r\nsubstantially in agreement with probability to be rejected. From\r\nhim we learn that when the sailors’ tickets were sent home to their\r\nfamilies to be cashed, the poor women were compelled to come up to\r\nthe pay office for their money, even from Scotland, and then if they\r\nwere ignorant of the forms to be complied with, or a “Q” (query) was\r\nput against any name, which he declares was often done on frivolous\r\npretexts, they were put off, and had their journey for nothing. Of\r\ncourse they sold the tickets to traders, who made a business of\r\nspeculating in them. Hodges takes great credit to himself for having\r\nbought large quantities at the very moderate discount of half a crown\r\nin the pound. It is probable that, allowing for all risks—stoppage of\r\ndeserters’ wages and Government delays—he did not make much profit.\r\nStill, his boast shows that a sailor’s family was thought lucky if it\r\nonly lost 12·5 per cent. on his wages. Hodges may be believed when he\r\nsays that in one small precinct of London he found a thousand, besides\r\nchildren, belonging to seamen’s families in absolute destitution.\r\n\r\nThere must have been a great fund of loyalty and discipline in England\r\nin the eighteenth century; otherwise all this would not have been\r\nendured for over a century by armed men, who again and again had the\r\ncountry, apparently at least, at their mercy. It is noteworthy that it\r\nwas mainly against this that the fleet mutinied at Spithead. The Nore\r\nbusiness was the work of political agitators—quota-men, themselves\r\nsupported by quota-men. Little was said of the cat, which may, we\r\nventure to think, be taken as evidence that the cat was never the\r\ngrievance it has been called. Admiral Cunningham asserts that the good\r\nmen considered it a protection against the bad. The grievance of the\r\npay, and the inhumanly long detention on shipboard, explains why the\r\nreal seamen, who knew how valuable they were to the merchant-skipper,\r\navoided the navy as much as they could. It is said by Admiral Ekins\r\nthat, when Captain Manley Dixon was commissioning a ship for the\r\nMediterranean, his crew was made up by men turned over from a ship\r\nwhich had just come home. A body of them came to him to represent\r\nthat they had not been ashore for nine years, and to ask that, if he\r\ncould, the captain would give them a run. Manley Dixon gave them his\r\npromise that he would, and kept it; nor had he any cause to regret his\r\nhumanity. Captains of this stamp did much to alleviate the hardship\r\nof the system, but it sufficiently explains the straits to which we\r\nwere driven to get good men. They were, indeed, extreme. Prisoners of\r\nwar, smugglers, debtors, boys, old men, convicts, anything that could\r\nstand on two legs—all were taken. When Manley Dixon himself laid the\r\n=Lion= across the bows of the _Guillaume Tell_ outside of Malta, he\r\nwas not only short-handed, but the large majority of his crew were\r\nboys—which explains why he did not allow himself to be boarded by the\r\nFrenchman, who had some two thousand seasoned fighters on board. There\r\nis an absolutely comic story told of Sir Home Popham, who was going on\r\na foreign station as Admiral. He complained to the Admiralty that his\r\ncrew were mere boys. In reply, he was told that his books showed that\r\nhe had received his due proportion of A.B.’s—which is, by the way,\r\na pleasing illustration of the trustworthiness of official papers.\r\nPopham was not to be fobbed off in this style. He weighed his crew,\r\nand found that they averaged under jockey-weight. Then the Admiralty\r\ndid scrape together a hundred grown men for him. A crew of boys with\r\na stiffening of seasoned seamen was not unpopular with captains, for\r\nit was active and amenable to discipline. The convicts were another\r\nstory, yet even with them something could be done. It is said by Ekins\r\nthat one captain received a batch of fifty at once. He called them aft,\r\nand made them a pregnant speech. He said that he knew their record,\r\nbut was resolved to consider them as men of fair character, subject to\r\nthis one proviso—if any of them misbehaved, he was to be punished twice\r\nas severely as another man. It was noted that the convicts generally\r\nbehaved particularly well, and no doubt came back reformed characters.\r\nPerhaps it may be said that this is not only a disenchanting picture,\r\nbut that it starts the question how, with such materials, we contrived\r\nto do so well? To this question several answers may be made. The human\r\nanimal, even when he is a quota-man, state-the-case-man, or convict,\r\nis indefinitely improvable by discipline, particularly when it can\r\nbe promptly and efficaciously enforced by the cat. Our discipline\r\nwas good, and the cat was not, as a rule, abused; such officers as\r\nPigot and Corbet being, in spite of foolish talk to the contrary, the\r\nexception and not the rule. Then there was always a proportion of men\r\nwho preferred the order of the navy, and its life of adventure, to\r\nthe pay of the merchant service. These seasoned the lump. Then there\r\nwas the captain, with his harsh standard of efficiency and his nearly\r\nabsolute power, to keep everybody up to the mark. We had an admirable\r\ncadre of officers, and under them a good body of warrant officers.\r\nThey, with a proportion of really fine seamen, and the steady corps of\r\nmarines, supplied a mould so strong and so admirably built that a great\r\ndeal of inferior material could be run into it without too much risk.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that discontent should not be rife, and its existence\r\nwas shown by the mutinies in individual ships which occurred during\r\nthe American rebellion. They were generally hushed up, and quieted\r\nby concessions to the mutineers; but there was no general removal of\r\ngrievances. With the outbreak of the Revolutionary war the grievances\r\nof the men were renewed and intensified. The press needed to supply\r\nthe immense fleets then armed was severe. A rise of thirty per cent.\r\nin the price of all necessaries reduced the already inadequate pay to\r\na starvation level. Minor grievances were more keenly felt because of\r\nthe increase in the great one. It was the custom of the Admiralty to\r\ngive the men only fourteen ounces for a pound in their rations, in\r\norder to prevent what was called leakage of stores. The medical stores\r\nwere insufficient and bad; indeed, the whole medical department was\r\nignorant and corrupt. The Greenwich Hospital pension was only £7, as\r\ncompared with the £13 given at Chelsea. Then, too, the experiments of\r\nCaptain Cook, and the reforms in diet by which Blane kept Rodney’s\r\nfleet in the West Indies in perfect health, had taught the sailors that\r\nfresh vegetables were an effectual protection against scurvy. Yet the\r\nAdmiralty persisted in serving out flour to the squadrons when they\r\nwere in harbour in England. The seamen felt—and they would have been\r\nmade of strange flesh and blood if they had not felt—bitterly aggrieved\r\nthat they, who were necessarily exposed to great hardships for the\r\ndefence of their country, should also be unnecessarily subjected to\r\na loathsome disease for want of what the Admiralty could easily have\r\nsupplied. Here, then, were all the elements of mutiny. Legitimate\r\ndiscontent among the men, felt most keenly by the prime seamen, who\r\nexercised a great influence over their less skilful comrades, but\r\nalso felt by the ordinary seamen, landsmen, and marines; and at\r\nthe Admiralty an authority which was obstinate in neglecting real\r\ngrievances, and had shown itself weak in dealing with insubordination\r\nin the last war. It was certain that as soon as a general combination\r\ncould be formed—always a difficult thing to do among ships on active\r\nservice—there would be an outbreak. Admiral Patton had predicted one as\r\nfar back as ’92.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1796 a combination was formed in the Channel fleet\r\nthen cruising off Brest under Bridport. It seems to have been confined\r\nto the prime seamen, who calculated, rightly, as it turned out, that\r\ntheir comrades would follow their lead. Four anonymous petitions\r\nwere sent to Howe—“Black Dick,” as the sailors called him—who had\r\nbeen compelled by gout to resign the command of the Channel fleet,\r\nand was recruiting at Bath. Howe sent them to the Admiralty, which,\r\nfinding them in the same handwriting, dismissed them as the work of\r\nan “ill-intentioned person,” and of no importance. This neglect was\r\ntaken by the men as a proof that even Howe, who was very popular with\r\nthem, could or would do nothing for them. They decided to act, and\r\nthe opportunity came when Bridport anchored at Spithead in the early\r\nspring of 1797. It was known that the fleet would go to sea on the 16th\r\nof April, and the men were resolved that the order to weigh should\r\nnot be obeyed till their grievances were redressed. By some means,\r\nwhich have never been revealed, news of this decision was given to\r\nCaptain Patton of the Transport Office at Portsmouth on the 12th, and\r\nby him carried to the Port-Admiral, who at once forwarded it to London\r\nby semaphore. The Admiralty recognised the gravity of the danger at\r\nlast, but could think of no way of dealing with it except to order the\r\nfleet to sea at once. Bridport hoisted his signal accordingly, but the\r\nmen were ready with their plan and their determination. They manned\r\nthe yards with cheers, hoisted the red flag—which was the recognised\r\nsignal for battle—at the main, and took the command out of the hands\r\nof the officers. There are some features of this mutiny which are\r\naltogether exceptional. No man’s name is associated with it as leader;\r\nit was absolutely unanimous, the marines joining eagerly with the\r\nsailors; no officer was hurt; the admiral’s flag was not hauled down;\r\nthe discipline of the ships went on as before—so much so that some\r\nbad characters, who took the opportunity to get drunk, were soundly\r\nflogged by their own comrades; but the crews would not get up anchor.\r\nA committee of thirty men—two delegates from each ship—was appointed\r\nto state their grievances to the king and both Houses of Parliament.\r\nIt met in the cabin of Howe’s old flagship, the =Queen Charlotte=,\r\nand there drew up its petitions. They are excellently worded, quite\r\nfree from bombast, and contain only a demand—firmly enough made, to\r\nbe sure—that the pay of the A.B.’s might be raised to a shilling a\r\nday, and that of all others in proportion; that their grievances as to\r\npension and rations should be removed, and that reasonable leave should\r\nbe given to men in home ports to see their families. The delegates also\r\ninsisted on a free pardon from the king, to be given in all the forms.\r\n\r\nThe devil in whom it had refused to believe being now raised, the\r\nAdmiralty behaved after the unchanging pattern of authorities, who\r\nare obstinate when they might have yielded with credit. It became\r\nfrightened. The position was, indeed, a dangerous one enough; for,\r\nthough little memory of the fact remains, the spirit of the army was\r\nnot much better than that of the fleet. The military pay had also\r\nremained stationary since the reign of Charles II., and in 1797 there\r\nwas a serious danger that the garrisons near London would break out as\r\nthe sailors had done. Fortunately, the Duke of York used his influence\r\nwith success. The War Office was induced to be wise in time, and\r\nmilitary discipline was saved from the shock of forced concessions\r\nto mutineers. There being no Duke of York to speak for the sailors,\r\nthings had been allowed to drift to the pass they had now reached. By\r\nthis time it was clear that the whole fleet was discontented. In the\r\ncircumstances the use of force was perhaps impossible. There remained\r\nthe alternative of instant, frank, and unreserved compliance with\r\ndemands which, after all, were very moderate. Concession ought to have\r\nbeen the easier because it was universally felt in the country that the\r\nmen were only asking for what should have been spontaneously granted at\r\nthe outbreak of the war. The Admiralty took the weak man’s favourite\r\nmiddle course, which combines all the evils of the other two, and\r\nmisses the good in them. The Board went down to Portsmouth and began\r\nto negotiate with the delegates. It showed a distinct tendency to make\r\nscapegoats of the subordinate officers, but refused for days to promise\r\nthe rise of pay. The result of this line of action hardly needs to be\r\ntold. The delegates refused to abate a jot of their demands. They even\r\nincreased them by adding a demand that the grievances of particular\r\nships should be corrected—in other words, that officers accused of\r\ntyrannical conduct should be dismissed. After ten days of useless\r\ntalk, “My Lords” surrendered at discretion, promised everything,\r\nand took themselves off, having done their best to consolidate the\r\npower of the delegates, and not a little to weaken still further the\r\nauthority of the officers. The red flag was hauled down, the Committee\r\nwas dissolved, everything appeared to have returned to the old order,\r\nand the mutiny to be at an end. It was promised that the fleet should\r\nnot go to sea till the House of Commons had voted the money for the\r\nincrease of pay, and the king’s proclamation of pardon was published.\r\nThough it appeared difficult for the Admiralty to add to the blunders\r\nit had already committed, it contrived to do so. Some delay took place\r\nin the publication of the king’s proclamation, and the introduction of\r\nthe vote for the wages in the House of Commons. As days passed, and\r\nnothing was heard of the proclamation or of the vote, the suspicions\r\nof the men were aroused. They knew the danger in which they stood,\r\nand began to fear that the Admiralty meant to cheat them. It was an\r\nabsurd enough suspicion, but a not unnatural one. The Admiralty ought\r\nat least to have foreseen that it could only be removed by the utmost\r\npromptitude and openness, since there was no power at hand to control\r\nthe fleet. Yet it kept silence, and delayed the execution of its\r\npromises from day to day. At Spithead discipline seemed to be restored.\r\nThe bulk of the squadron moved round to St. Helens, leaving Colpoys’s\r\nflagship, the =London=, and the =Marlborough= at Spithead. Whether\r\norder would have remained unbroken is perhaps doubtful; but just at\r\nthis moment the Admiralty took a step which set the whole mutiny\r\nflaming again. An order was sent down to the captains of ships which\r\nwas a masterpiece of folly. It began by instructing the officers to\r\nbe more careful in superintending the issue of stores to the men, and\r\nthen proceeded to give them a number of directions as to the course\r\nto be taken for the preventing of future mutinies. The first part,\r\nwhich by implication accused them of pilfering—a charge never made\r\nby the delegates—caused profound indignation among the officers. The\r\nsecond, of which the substance was immediately known to the crews,\r\nconverted their suspicions into certainty—and they instantly broke out\r\nagain. With this outburst began the second and distinctly criminal\r\nstage of the great mutiny. Hitherto the conduct of the men had been as\r\ninnocent as the nature of the work they were doing permitted. Now they\r\nwere about to illustrate the universal tendency of all revolt against\r\nauthority to degenerate into sheer violence and rebellion.\r\n\r\nThis order was to be inserted in the general instructions between the\r\nclauses providing for the reading of the articles of war and for the\r\nrating of the ship’s company. Among other things, it directed the\r\ncaptain to “see that the arms and ammunition belonging to the marines\r\nbe constantly kept in good order and fit for immediate service as well\r\nin harbour as at sea.” At the end was a general direction to officers\r\nto be ready “on the first appearance of mutiny to use the most vigorous\r\nmeans to suppress it, and to bring the ringleaders to punishment.”\r\nHitherto the inspection of the marines’ arms had been left to the\r\nmarine officer. That a change should be made at this moment was not\r\nunnaturally considered an ominous sign by the men. The purpose for\r\nwhich it was made was clear enough to crews which were from the very\r\nnature of the case in a state of “preternatural suspicion.” Neither the\r\narrival of the order nor its purport could be wholly concealed, though\r\nthe captains were as reserved as they possibly could be. Rumours leaked\r\nout in an exaggerated form, and had the very worst effects on the minds\r\nof the men, who were already angry at the apparent delay on the part\r\nof Parliament to vote the money required to make good the promises of\r\nthe Admiralty. This delay was undoubtedly a mistake. Pitt, looking\r\ntoo exclusively to the dignity of the Government, had decided that it\r\nwould be the more becoming course to grant the money by a silent vote.\r\nAs a mere matter of Parliamentary manners he was probably right;\r\nbut it argued a certain want of imagination on his part that he did\r\nnot realise the effect the silence of the House would produce on the\r\nsailors. The necessary forms of business might have made it impossible\r\nto bring the motion in sooner, but some notice might have been taken of\r\nthe petition of the sailors to the Commons. Pitt decided otherwise, the\r\nAdmiralty acted in its own injudicious way, and the mutiny broke out\r\nagain at St. Helens just two days before Parliament voted the £372,000\r\nrequired to provide for the increase of pay.\r\n\r\nThe disturbance began in the =Duke=, a three-decker, which had been the\r\nvessel immediately ahead of Rodney’s flagship in the line of battle in\r\nthe great battle off Dominica in 1782. The crew forced their way into\r\nCaptain Holloway’s cabin, and insisted on seeing the menacing Admiralty\r\norder. Holloway had destroyed it, foreseeing the effect it was likely\r\nto produce if made public. The crew were not to be stopped. They seized\r\nHolloway, and sent a message to the admiral demanding a copy of the\r\norder, with the threat that they would hang the captain or inflict “a\r\ndegrading punishment”—in other words, flog him—if it was not produced.\r\nThis was mutiny pure and simple, but Bridport was helpless, and the\r\norder was given up. Of course, it was instantly sent round the fleet to\r\nexasperate the prevailing ferment. This happened on the 5th or 6th of\r\nMay. On the 7th, Bridport, having heard that the French fleet at Brest\r\nhad dropped down to the outer harbour, hoisted the signal to proceed\r\nto sea. Thereupon the scene of the previous 15th April was repeated.\r\nThe red flag was hoisted, ropes were reeved at the yardarm as a threat\r\nto “traitors” who should fail to support their fellow-members of the\r\ncrews, and the officers were disarmed. The fleet was divided. The bulk\r\nof it was at St. Helens, while Admiral Colpoys, with his flagship, the\r\n=London=, and the =Marlborough= remained at Spithead. From the deck\r\nof the =London= the coming and going of the boats among the ships at\r\nSt. Helens was distinctly visible. Judging rightly that the mutiny had\r\nbroken out afresh, Colpoys decided to make a fight for his authority.\r\nHe turned up his crew, and asked them whether they had any complaints\r\nto make. They answered they had not. Whether Colpoys overrated the\r\nmeaning of the answer or not, he certainly decided to fight. The men\r\nmay only have meant that, unlike the crew of the =Marlborough=, who had\r\nparticular grievances, they had no complaint to make of their officers.\r\nIt did not follow that they were disposed to break away from the rest\r\nof the squadron. The question was soon put to the test. Boats were\r\nseen coming into Spithead from the ships at St. Helens. They could\r\nonly be bringing the delegates on their way to demand the adhesion of\r\nthe =London=. Colpoys at once paraded the marines on the quarter-deck,\r\nstationed sentries at the sally-ports, and gave orders that the boats\r\nwere to be fired on if they insisted on coming alongside. Then he\r\nordered the sailors below. Some obeyed, but it was noted as a bad\r\nsign that among those who went below were the three warrant-officers,\r\nthe boatswain, the gunner, and the carpenter. A portion of the crew,\r\nincluding, as would appear, most of the real sailors, collected in a\r\ngroup forward, and stood there facing the admiral, who remained with\r\nhis officers and the marines on the quarter-deck. The delegates came\r\nalongside, and were warned off by the sentries. They then appealed\r\nto the crew, and with effect, for the men in the forecastle began\r\nto stir, and some of them started to unlash one of the forward guns\r\nand train it on the quarter-deck. Bover, the first lieutenant of the\r\n=London=, threatened to fire if they did not desist. Some of the men\r\nwere cowed, but one of them, made of stouter and more dangerous stuff,\r\ndared the lieutenant to fire. Bover took him at his word, fired, and\r\nshot him dead. If the crew had been really wavering and the marines\r\nsteady, this act of vigour would probably have quelled the mutiny.\r\nBut, in the spirit they were in, it had a directly contrary effect.\r\nThe whole crew broke out at once. The men forward rushed aft; those\r\nbelow rushed on deck; the marines broke from their ranks and mingled\r\nwith the sailors. As might be expected in such a scene, different\r\naccounts were given of what happened. There was certainly a fight,\r\nin which several of the mutineers, a midshipman, and the officer of\r\nmarines were more or less severely wounded. As a matter of course, the\r\nofficers were soon overpowered. It is extraordinary that no harm was\r\ndone to Colpoys himself. He attributed his escape to the fact that\r\nhe faced the mutineers all through. They seem to have preserved some\r\nrespect for him personally. According to one story, a mutineer who\r\ncalled him “a d——d b——y rascal” was silenced by his fellows with the\r\nthreat of being thrown overboard; and another, who aimed a musket at\r\nhim through a grating, had his weapon knocked out of his hands. But\r\nthe men appeared determined to go to all lengths against Bover. He was\r\ndragged to the forecastle, and a rope prepared to hang him at the yard\r\narm. The noose was actually round his neck, when Colpoys manfully came\r\nforward and declared that the lieutenant had acted by his orders. It\r\nshows how strong the tradition of discipline was among the crews still,\r\nthat this was accepted as a justification. One of the topmen is also\r\nsaid to have appealed to the mutineers to spare Bover because “he was a\r\nbrave boy.” The admiral and the topman contrived between them to save\r\nhis life. Of course the =London= now joined the other ships, and the\r\n=Marlborough= with her. Colpoys and Bover were, after some discussion\r\nwhether they should not be tried on board, sent on shore for trial. The\r\ncoroner’s jury which sat on the mutineer found a verdict of justifiable\r\nhomicide. The wounded midshipman and marine officer were carried to\r\nHaslar, but the sick and wounded seamen in the hospital showed such a\r\nsavage determination to do them a damage that the authorities found it\r\nnecessary to transfer them to a private house.\r\n\r\nThis second phase of the mutiny lasted from the 7th to the 15th of May,\r\nand was in all ways worse than the first. Many of the officers were\r\nset on shore by the men, and among them, Admiral Alan Gardner, who\r\nhad, idly enough, drawn his sword on the delegates in the cabin of the\r\n=Queen Charlotte= during the first stage of the mutiny. It is said that\r\nwhen told that a cutter was manned to take him on shore, he replied\r\nthat he should at least be allowed his barge, and that the barge was\r\nallowed him. When the news of the mutiny reached London, the Admiralty\r\nhad recourse to the officer to whom it might well have appealed at the\r\nbeginning. It sent Howe down on the 10th with the Act just passed by\r\nParliament for the increase of pay, and the king’s pardon. It was the\r\nadmiral’s last piece of service, and a more disagreeable one could\r\nhardly have been found, for he had in fact to notify the surrender of\r\nGovernment to the mutineers. It was a duty, however, which he could not\r\npossibly refuse, for there were no means of coercing the men, and they\r\nwould apparently not be convinced that no deceit was intended except\r\non the word of “Black Dick.” Howe did the work in his usual solid way.\r\nHe met the delegates on board the =Queen Charlotte=, and persuaded\r\nthem to promise that the fleet should return to duty. The promise was\r\nkept. The squadron went to sea at once, and there was an end of what\r\nis commonly called the mutiny at Spithead, but was in fact the double\r\nmutiny at Spithead and St. Helens. If the disorder had ended here, the\r\nmovement would have stood altogether alone among military seditions.\r\nCertainly no body of mutinous men was ever provoked by more genuine\r\ngrievances, and none ever behaved with greater moderation on the whole.\r\nBut it was not in the nature of things that it could stop here. The\r\nmen had tasted the pleasure of defying authority, which is of itself\r\ncorrupting. During the second outbreak they objected by name to over a\r\nhundred officers of all ranks from Colpoys down to two masters-at-arms.\r\nAll these officers were left on shore when the squadron put to sea.\r\nThe Admiralty did not try them, and it did keep them on full pay; but\r\nit did not restore them to their ships. This was, of course, a very\r\nbad example, and could only serve to convince all crews that they\r\ncould get rid of any officer they pleased. If the prime seamen had\r\npreserved their influence throughout the fleet, the agitation might\r\nhave died quietly. But these men soon made the discovery commonly made\r\nby any class which has headed a revolt against one above. It had set\r\nan example to those below. In the Channel, where the quality of the\r\ncrews appears to have been above the average, there was no more open\r\ndisorder, though the mutinous feeling continued to require watching. On\r\nother stations, where the quota-men and the convict element were more\r\nfully represented, the example set at Spithead was followed, and this\r\ntime the leaders were seditious agitators of the stamp of Parker and\r\nBott.\r\n\r\nThe end of the mutiny at St. Helens overlapped the beginning of the\r\nmutiny at the Nore. This more criminal movement began on the 12th May,\r\nthree days before Howe received the submission of the delegates of the\r\nChannel fleet. At that date the North Sea squadron was at sea, under\r\ncommand of Admiral Duncan, watching the coast of Holland. There were at\r\nthe Little Nore some half-score frigates and small vessels, together\r\nwith two 64-gun ships—the =Inflexible=, commanded by Captain Ferris,\r\nand the =Director=, commanded by Captain Bligh. This was the Bligh of\r\nthe =Bounty=, he who was afterwards deposed from his governorship of\r\nNew South Wales by Major Johnston of the 102nd Foot. It would have\r\nbeen strange if there had been mutiny to the fore, and he not there.\r\nThe flagship of Buckner, the Port-Admiral, was the =Sandwich=, 90,\r\nwhich was not armed for sea-service, having only her upper-deck guns\r\non board. She was, however, full of men, and of prime seamen. For fear\r\nthat they would desert, these men were not allowed on shore. Buckner,\r\nwho wished to preserve them for Duncan, would not even give them to\r\nthe frigate captains who applied for some of them by name to fill the\r\npetty officers’ berths. We can understand that there was much sulky\r\nindignation among them, and that the news of the outbreak at Spithead,\r\nwhich filtered in, set up some ferment on the flagship’s lower deck.\r\nThere was a man on board her who was admirably fitted, by training and\r\ncharacter, to turn discontent into mutiny. In France, as it had been\r\nfour years earlier, this man would probably have played a considerable\r\npart. By us he is only remembered as Richard Parker the Mutineer, who\r\nended his life at the yardarm of the =Sandwich=. He was the son of a\r\ntradesman at Exeter, and he began life in the position of a gentleman,\r\nas midshipman on board the =Culloden= in 1786. He was discharged from\r\nher, and then from the =Leander=, for immoral conduct, and for setting\r\na bad example to his messmates. In 1793, when he had finished his time\r\nas midshipman and was rated mate, he was broken by court martial for\r\ninsubordination, was sent before the mast, and thence invalided into\r\nhospital. For a space he disappeared. When he reappeared, he was in\r\nprison for debt at Edinburgh. He had married, and had attempted the\r\ntrade of schoolmaster. To escape from prison, he took the bounty, and\r\ncame into the navy again as quota-man from Perth. He had only been\r\ndrafted to the =Sandwich= six weeks before the mutiny broke out. This\r\nis not unlike the early career of many heroes of the French Revolution.\r\nWhether Parker belonged to one of our native revolutionary societies\r\nof the time is not certain. It was afterwards asserted that he did,\r\nand was sent on board as being, from his training, a likely person to\r\nfoment a mutiny. This, however, is so much the kind of story which\r\nwould be told that it cannot be accepted as evidence. On the other\r\nhand, it is not intrinsically improbable. He himself had the grace\r\nto “die game,” and without betraying his associates on shore, if he\r\nhad any. All we can be sure of is, that he was very much the stamp of\r\nman who did belong to Jacobin societies, and that his training had\r\nqualified him admirably for the part he played. On board the ships at\r\nthe Nore he had to his hand plenty of the kind of material which the\r\ndemagogue loves. The London police had been in the habit of sending\r\nits criminals on board for some time, and among them undoubtedly were\r\nmembers of the Corresponding Society and United Irishmen. Men of a\r\nbetter stamp felt the common grievances, and there was a feeling among\r\nthem—very wrong-headed, but not wholly base—that it would be mean in\r\nthem not to back up their fellow-seamen at Spithead.\r\n\r\nThat Parker had been active in fomenting the mutiny is clear from\r\nthe fact that he appears as leader from the very beginning. It broke\r\nout on the =Sandwich= while most of the captains were on board the\r\n=Inflexible=, attending a court martial on a Captain Savage. As had\r\nbeen the case at Spithead, no violence was done to the officers. In the\r\ncourse of the day an incident happened which showed the difference of\r\nthe two movements. The =San Fiorenzo= frigate arrived from Portsmouth.\r\nThe mutineers cheered her as she came in, believing perhaps that she\r\ncame to ask her help for the Channel fleet. But the =San Fiorenzo= was\r\na loyal ship. Her captain, Sir Harry Burrard Neale, seeing from the\r\nlook of the ships at the Little Nore that something must be wrong, gave\r\norders that the cheers should not be answered. This was a bad sign for\r\nthe mutineer leaders, and in the course of the day they learnt that\r\nthe crew of the =Clyde= frigate, commanded by Captain Cunningham, was\r\nalso loyal and would obey their officers. This was a warning to Parker\r\nand his associates of the dangerous nature of the game they were\r\nplaying. Their one chance of success was the unanimity of the fleet;\r\nbut they had gone too far to go back now. It was decided to coerce the\r\nrecalcitrant ships. On the 13th the =Inflexible= ranged up alongside\r\nthe =San Fiorenzo=, and threatened to fire into her if the crew did\r\nnot cheer. With the consent of Captain Neale, the sign of adhesion was\r\ngiven. It is one of the comic incidents of the mutiny that, when the\r\nmen took the command from Captain Ferris, they rated him midshipman to\r\nshow that there was no ill-feeling. A similar course was taken with the\r\n=Clyde=. But though these ships were forced to appear to join, and to\r\naccompany the mutineers when they went out from the Little Nore to the\r\nNore, they remained loyal to their officers. The men of the =Clyde=\r\ndid so far show themselves mutinous as to insist on getting rid of the\r\ndoctor and the sergeant of marines. The latter was, perhaps, a bully,\r\nand the medical department was, as we have said before, exceptionally\r\nand intensely unpopular among the men. Cunningham would have stood\r\nby his officer; but the doctor became frightened, and begged to be\r\nallowed to go. The sergeant of marines was discharged regularly to\r\nsave appearances, and replaced by a man appointed in the ordinary way.\r\nThe conduct of the men of the =Clyde= and the =San Fiorenzo= is worth\r\nnoting, because it shows what it was that finally brought about the\r\nruin of the mutineers. This fleet was not unanimous. These two vessels\r\nwere forced into the mutiny against their will, and on board all the\r\nother vessels there was a loyal minority. The daily proceedings on\r\nboard were not noted with detail on the logs, for good reasons; but it\r\nis known that on several vessels there were officers who defied the\r\nmutineers all through and withstood Parker to his face; yet they were\r\nprotected from outrage by a minority of the men.\r\n\r\nThere were two stages in the mutiny at the Nore. The first lasted\r\nfrom the 15th to the 31st of May. During this period the only ships\r\nengaged were those already mentioned. On the 31st vessels began to\r\ndrop in from the North Sea, and they continued to come till the 6th\r\nJune. These were the ships which aroused the intense indignation of\r\nthe whole country by first deserting their admiral in the presence of\r\nthe enemy in the Texel, and then attempting to blockade the Thames.\r\nDuring the first fortnight the mutinous ships moved out to the Nore,\r\ndragging the reluctant =Clyde= and =San Fiorenzo= with them. The red\r\nflag was hoisted, and Admiral Buckner’s flag was hauled down. Day after\r\nday Parker with his committee of delegates and a mob of mutineers\r\nseveral hundred strong landed at Chatham and paraded the streets with\r\nred banners. Buckner was helpless. The only garrison in the town was\r\na handful of invalids, and they, it was noted, began, “when elevated\r\nwith drink,” to express the intention to appoint delegates of their\r\nown and to demonstrate for themselves. Parker was abundantly insolent\r\nto Buckner personally, but, on the whole, there was no great violence\r\nshown. A committee from the fleet visited the hospital, and used such\r\nstrong language that the assistant-surgeon, a certain Mr. Safferay,\r\ncommitted suicide in a fit of terror by shooting himself. The boatswain\r\nof the =Proserpine=, who had made himself hateful to the men, was\r\nseized and dragged off to the =Sandwich= to be hanged. But he pleaded\r\nthe orders of his superiors, and, strange to say, the excuse was\r\naccepted, as it had been in the case of Lieutenant Bover. The mutineers\r\ndid not, however, let the boatswain off altogether. They paraded him\r\nround the fleet with two large swabs tied to his shoulders and a rope\r\nround his neck, while a boatful of drummer boys beat the rogue’s\r\nmarch. There was as yet more vacant horseplay and noise than violence\r\namong the mutineers. So little did the crews appear to be in earnest\r\nthat they allowed eight days to pass before they presented their\r\nlist of demands. When it was handed in, it was found to begin with a\r\nsuperfluous demand that, whatever had been given to ships at Spithead\r\nshould be given to those at the Nore, and then to contain a demand that\r\na ship’s company should have a right to object to an officer, and that\r\nthe articles of war should be revised. It was now becoming clear that\r\nthere must be no paltering with this mutiny. Lord Spencer, the First\r\nLord, with his colleagues, Lord Allan and Admiral Young, came down to\r\nChatham with an offer of pardon to those who would return to duty at\r\nonce, but resolved to direct resolute measures against the disorderly\r\nships. The militia was called out, and steps taken to put Chatham in a\r\nstate of defence. An attempt to bring the men to reason quietly was\r\nmade on the 28th May, when the king’s proclamation of pardon was read\r\non all the ships. It was not without effect. On the =Brilliant=, at\r\nleast, the mutinous party only kept the upper hand with difficulty.\r\nThroughout the fleet the loyal minority was encouraged, and some of\r\nthe mutineers shaken. Parker did not improve his popularity by causing\r\none of the sailors of the =Brilliant= to be ducked for speaking\r\ndisrespectfully of the delegates. Still the mutineers kept possession\r\nof the squadron. The first serious blow was given them by the escape\r\nof the =Clyde= and the =San Fiorenzo=. Cunningham and Neale decided to\r\nmake a push for freedom, and would have done it sooner if they had not\r\nhad hopes of bringing off the =Director=. Cunningham was sure of his\r\nown men, who had refused to put him on shore, though Parker came with\r\nthe demand himself, and had stood at quarters all through the night of\r\nthe 28th with the guns cast loose, expecting every moment to be fired\r\ninto. On the 29th, Cunningham took an opportunity while the ships were\r\nswinging in the tide, so that he was not actually under the guns of a\r\nmutinous ship. He cut his cables and made a dash for Sheerness. The\r\nmutineers fired on him as soon as their guns would bear, but he escaped\r\nserious damage, and after tacking twice, contrived to turn into safe\r\nanchorage under the guns of the forts. Sir Harry Neale was less lucky.\r\nA pilot, who had been smuggled on board the =San Fiorenzo= through the\r\nmutineers’ guard-boats, cut his cable too soon, and she cast the wrong\r\nway. There was nothing for it but to run through the mutinous ships,\r\nwhich Sir Harry did successfully, though fired into right and left.\r\nThe =San Fiorenzo= was carried over to the coast of Essex, and thence\r\nto Portsmouth. On her way out she sighted the first of the ships which\r\nhad deserted Duncan standing into the Thames with the red flag flying.\r\nNeale kept the red flag up himself as long as he was in any danger, and\r\nthen went on to Spithead, where he arrived not only safely, but with a\r\nFrench privateer, which he picked up on his way down.\r\n\r\nThe desertion of Duncan by his squadron was the culmination of the\r\ngreat mutiny. It was also the event which proved to the country and to\r\nthe better stamp of men throughout the fleet what the consequences of\r\ninsubordination inevitably are. None were made more indignant by it\r\nthan the crews in the Channel, who refused to have any dealings with\r\nParker, and even volunteered to assist in reducing the mutineers to\r\norder. News travelled slowly in those times, and it is probable that\r\nthe crews in the North Sea had only a very vague notion of what had\r\nbeen the end of the Spithead outbreak; but they did know that there was\r\na Dutch force in the Texel getting ready for an invasion of England,\r\nand they did their best to leave it an open road. As might be expected,\r\nthe conduct of these men was throughout wanting in the moderation shown\r\nat Spithead. Among the demands which they made was one that in future\r\na common sailor should be a member of every court martial by which a\r\nforemast man was tried. The revolutionary flavour of that demand was\r\nbeyond dispute. When the ships actually reached the Nore, some of their\r\ncrews not only committed acts of savage violence on officers, but were\r\nguilty of downright piracy.\r\n\r\nThe trouble in Duncan’s ships began in Yarmouth Roads on the 27th of\r\nMay, the day before the =Clyde= cut her cable and ran for Sheerness.\r\nOn that day the crew of the =Venerable=, 74, the flagship, who are\r\nsaid to have been instigated by Parker, and who must in any case have\r\nknown what was happening at the Nore, ran into the rigging and began\r\ncheering in a disorderly manner. They had to deal with a body of\r\nofficers who were not to be trifled with. Duncan called the marines\r\nunder arms, and sent his officers among the men with orders to bring\r\nthem down. The order was obeyed, and the men mustered in the waist.\r\nThen the admiral gave them a little address, the point of which was\r\nthat he would go all lengths before he would allow the command of the\r\nship to be taken out of his hands. When one of the men cried out that\r\nthis was precisely what they meant to do, the admiral drew sword on\r\nhim, and would have cut him down if his arm had not been held by the\r\nchaplain. Then he ordered all who meant to stand by their officers to\r\ngo over to the starboard side, and was instantly obeyed by all the\r\ncrew except six. These six were at once put in irons in the wardroom.\r\nThey were, obviously, entirely surprised by the turn their adventure\r\nhad taken, and sent a humble message begging for pardon. Duncan, with\r\nwhat would have been weakness in another man, forgave them. It was not\r\ncredible that the crew of the =Venerable= was the only one infected by\r\nthe mutinous spirit, and the admiral called on his captains to report\r\nwhether they had seen any sign of disaffection among their men. With\r\nthe single exception of Captain Hotham, of the =Adamant=, 50, they\r\nreplied that they had seen none. Duncan went on board the =Adamant=\r\nand mustered the crew. There was a repetition of the scene on the\r\n=Venerable’s= deck; one of the crew of the =Adamant= told the admiral\r\nthat they meant to dispute his authority. Duncan was, as his pictures\r\nremain to prove, a man of great height, and his physical strength was\r\nimmense. He seized the impudent fellow, and swung him over the side of\r\nthe ship. Then, holding him suspended by one hand, he asked the crew to\r\nlook at this fellow who dared to dispute his authority. The Adamants\r\ncheered with delight, and no more was heard of their discontent. For a\r\nmoment it appeared as if the admiral’s personal influence would keep\r\nhis whole squadron steady; but the appearance was delusive. On the 29th\r\nMay he ordered his ships to sea, and they stood out; but no sooner\r\nwere they clear of the shoals off Yarmouth than all of them which had\r\nbeen declared to be trustworthy deserted him, leaving him only his own\r\nflagship and the =Adamant=, on which he had already faced and disarmed\r\nthe mutiny. Duncan’s further conduct is famous in our naval history.\r\nHe took the =Venerable= and the =Adamant= over to the Texel. There he\r\nremained through the summer, announcing his intention to fight the\r\nDutch if they came out, and go down with the flag flying. As he had his\r\ntwo crews now well in hand, it is credible that, if the enemy had put\r\nto sea, our naval history would have included another last fight of the\r\n=Revenge=.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the squadron now went off in detachments to the Nore, to\r\nthe number of ten or a dozen line-of-battle ships and frigates. On\r\nboard some of them, at least, disgraceful weakness was shown by the\r\nofficers. No one, perhaps, has the right to sneer at the commander who\r\nquails before unanimous and violent mutiny, unless he has himself faced\r\nthat most dreadful of military dangers. But there is no excuse for\r\nan officer who shrinks from doing his duty when a part of his command\r\nis ready and even eager to support him. According to Brenton, who was\r\nthen one of his lieutenants, Captain Fancourt, of the =Agamemnon=,\r\nwas guilty of this weakness. He yielded to his crew at once, and not\r\nonly so, but when he was told by some of the petty officers, who sent\r\nthe message through Brenton, that, if he would order the marines to\r\nact, a large part of the sailors would stand by him, he deliberately\r\nrefused, on the ground that there would be a fight, and that he could\r\nnot bear to see his poor men “writhing on the deck.” As was only\r\nnatural, no captain in the squadron was treated with more absolute\r\ncontempt by the mutineers than Fancourt. By the 6th of June the North\r\nSea ships had assembled at the Nore. Their arrival revived the spirit\r\nof Parker and his associates, which had been greatly shaken by the\r\nescape of the =Clyde= and the =San Fiorenzo=, and then further damped\r\nby the subsequent escape of the =Serapis= and the =Discovery=, armed\r\ntransports, which succeeded in following the example set by the\r\nfrigates. The news, too, from the shore was very bad; but the leaders\r\nstill hoped to cow the country. A blockade of the river was ordered,\r\nand the trade stopped. Parker still professed great loyalty. The\r\nfeasts on the Restoration Day, 29th of May, and the King’s Birthday,\r\nthe 4th of June, were observed with all the usual forms. On the 4th\r\nof June, Parker sent on shore for the chaplain of the =Sandwich= to\r\npreach the Birthday sermon. The chaplain, whose name was Hatherall,\r\ncame, and he had the courage to choose for his text Job xxvii. 5—“God\r\nforbid that I should justify you; till I die I will not remove mine\r\nintegrity from me”—and to preach a loyal sermon on it. To the credit\r\nof the men, he was allowed to land unhurt. Other incidents of these\r\ndays were not equally creditable. The surgeon of one ship was tarred\r\nand feathered. Brenton, who does not give the names, says that this man\r\nhad been drunk in his cabin for five weeks, and he half excuses the\r\nact as one of “wild justice.” On the =Monmouth=, whose captain, Lord\r\nNorthesk, afterwards third in command at Trafalgar, disliked the use\r\nof the cat, the men flogged the second master, two masters’ mates, a\r\nmidshipman, and a sergeant of marines. They then shaved their heads,\r\nand turned them ashore. Parties landed from the ships and plundered\r\nthe farmhouses. Trading vessels were overhauled and pillaged. In fact,\r\nthe fleet was rapidly drifting into mere piracy. Meanwhile the anger on\r\nshore was growing daily. Troops and volunteers poured into Sheerness.\r\nThe forts at the mouth of the Thames were supplied with furnaces for\r\nheating shot. Some vessels in the Long Reach were manned and got ready\r\nfor service. The whole body of merchant seamen, who were threatened by\r\nthe blockade of the Thames, were eager to serve against the mutineers.\r\nOn the 6th of June Parliament passed the Act for preventing the\r\nseduction of sailors or soldiers, which made all communication with the\r\nmutineers an indictable offence.\r\n\r\nThis Act really broke the backbone of the mutiny. It showed the men\r\nthat the country was not to be cowed. The timid or more moderate were\r\nfrightened, and those who had committed themselves too far began to\r\nclamour for desperate courses. Parker talked of taking the ships over\r\nto Holland, and surrendering them to the enemy. Whether, even if he\r\nhad induced the squadron to follow him, he could have got off is very\r\ndoubtful. Lord Keith, who had arrived a few days before to take command\r\nof the naval operations against the mutineers, had removed the beacons\r\nand buoys from the Swin and other shallows at the mouth of the Thames,\r\nfor the express purpose of cutting off their retreat. Without pilots,\r\nwhom they could not obtain, they could hardly have got the ships out.\r\nBut there was no inclination on the part of the men to follow Parker\r\nthey knew not where. He himself obviously felt that the game was going\r\nagainst him, but an air of defiance was kept up painfully enough. Lord\r\nNorthesk was “ordered” on shore with a statement of grievances to be\r\ngiven to the king. On the 7th the effigies of “Billy Pitt” and “Dundas”\r\nwere hung at the yardarm. Parker went round the fleet reading extracts\r\nfrom what he called the king’s “foolish” proclamation, with seditious\r\ncomments; but on board the =Ardent=, 74, he was openly rebuked by a\r\nLieutenant Wardour for garbling it, and enough men stood by the officer\r\nto save him from retaliation. In fact, the dislike of all Englishmen\r\nfor an upstart was beginning to tell against the mutineer leader. He\r\nwas openly jeered at as a “pretty admiral of the fleet.” It does\r\nnot appear that Parker ever called himself by this title, and the\r\nstory that he proclaimed a “floating republic” is a myth; but he did\r\nexercise authority, and it soon became offensive. On the 10th June the\r\nfirst-fruits of the combined disgust, fear, and repentance of the men\r\nwas seen in the escape of the =Leopard=. The captain had been landed,\r\nbut one lieutenant at least remained on board, with some subordinate\r\nofficers. This officer, whose name was Robb, learnt that he would find\r\nsupport if he attempted to retake the ship. During the night of the 9th\r\nJune, he, with the help of some masters, mates, and midshipmen, trained\r\ntwo of the wardroom guns forward and loaded them with grape-shot. Next\r\nmorning, when the tide was flowing, and therefore able to carry the\r\nship up the river, he threw open the door and unmasked his battery.\r\nThen, leaving trusty men by the guns with orders to sweep the deck, if\r\nnecessary, he rushed out and ordered the mutineers to surrender. There\r\nwas a fight, but in the end Robb and his fellow-officers contrived to\r\ncut the cable, to get enough sail set to give the =Leopard= steerage\r\nway, and to carry her off, fighting fiercely all the time with those\r\nof the mutineers who refused to submit. He brought her up the Thames\r\nwith the remnant of the mutineers under hatches. The =Repulse=, 64,\r\nfollowed. Her crew spontaneously replaced the officers in command. She\r\nran on the Nore Sand and lay under the fire of the mutineers for an\r\nhour and a half, but was at last got off, and carried into Sheerness.\r\nFrom that moment till the final surrender of the =Sandwich=, one\r\nvessel after another either cut and ran, or merely hauled down the\r\nred flag and hoisted the blue—which the sailors called the “signal of\r\nagreeableness.” On board the =Standard= the leader of the mutineers,\r\nwhose name, “strangely enough,” says Captain Cunningham, was William\r\nWallace, shot himself when he saw the game was up. A few of the more\r\ndesperate men seized a smack and fled across the North Sea. They ran\r\nher ashore on the coast of Holland. Parker himself, whether from\r\nirresolution or from what in a better man one might call magnanimity,\r\ndid not attempt to escape. He was surrendered by his messmates of the\r\n=Sandwich=, and, as we have said, met his death at the fore-yardarm\r\nlike a man, having written the proper sort of letter to his wife,\r\nexpressed due contrition for his offences, and asked, as the leader\r\nof an unsuccessful rebellion should, that his life might be accepted\r\nas sufficient sacrifice. If it was all, or even partly, affectation,\r\nat least it was the affectation of a man who knew the becoming thing\r\nto do. There were in all eighteen mutineers executed, of whom four\r\nwere marines. The total number of men condemned to death was nearly\r\nforty; but the Government was not disposed to be more severe than it\r\ncould help. When Duncan, at the head of a fleet consisting almost\r\nwholly of ships which had been in the mutiny, gained the battle of\r\nCamperdown, the king was advised to publish a general pardon. It was\r\nlong before the discipline of the navy wholly recovered the shock it\r\nhad received; but the great mutiny was over, and the State could afford\r\nto be generous without fear that its generosity would be mistaken for\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nThe grievances of the men being universal, the conditions which led to\r\ninsubordination were found everywhere more or less. As the Government\r\nin its dire need of men had gone so far as to send such known rebels\r\nas United Irishmen into the crews of some of its ships—particularly\r\ninto those which had their headquarters at Beerhaven and to some of\r\nthe vessels with Jervis—there was no lack of agitators ready to profit\r\nby the unrest of their comrades. Something, too, must be allowed for\r\nthe force of example. Men mutinied on one station when they heard of\r\na mutiny elsewhere. It was the report from Spithead which started the\r\noutbreak at the Nore. It was the arrival of the =Alcmene= frigate from\r\nthe Nore which set going the ferment in Jervis’s squadron. The fatal\r\nresult of all successful insubordination is that it sets the worser\r\nkind of man arguing that, if so much has been extorted already, more\r\ncan be obtained by the same method. Therefore spasmodic outbreaks\r\ncontinued for a time to occur at home and abroad as the fire spread.\r\nSome were of little importance, and may be briefly dismissed. Among\r\nthem was the insubordination at Plymouth which followed the mutiny\r\nat the Nore. Lord Keith had been sent there from Sheerness when the\r\nlast of Parker’s followers surrendered. He was to hoist his flag in\r\nthe =Queen Charlotte= as second in command of the Channel fleet. The\r\noutbreak was a comparatively slight one, and Keith quelled it by\r\nfirmness and tact. In October, so soon as the news began to arrive\r\nfrom home, a very serious mutiny took place among the ships at the\r\nCape. This was suppressed mainly by the firmness of the governor, Lord\r\nMacartney, and of Dundas, the general in command. They threatened to\r\nsink the ships, which were few in number and were lying under the guns\r\nof the forts. To this threat the men surrendered. Several of the more\r\nactive leaders were hanged or flogged.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous and the best known aftermath of the great convulsion\r\nat home was the so-called mutiny off Cadiz. The movement never went\r\nbeyond partial disorder and treasonable threats in individual ships.\r\nStill, in view of Duncan’s experience at Yarmouth, it would be rash\r\nto assert that if firmness and promptitude had not been shown, a part\r\nat least of the Mediterranean fleet would not have broken away. It\r\ndoes not appear that Jervis had cause to distrust the ships which had\r\nfought under him on the 14th February, but as the summer wore on the\r\nGovernment began to reinforce him. Not unnaturally, it selected for\r\nthis service such ships as it preferred to employ at a distance—namely,\r\nthose which had been conspicuous in the Spithead mutiny, or had been\r\nnoted for bad conduct in the squadron serving under Curtis on the\r\ncoast of Ireland. These ships were swarming with United Irishmen,\r\nwho formed a large proportion of the eleven to twelve thousand Irish\r\nin the fleet. In Jervis’s own squadron the marines had been largely\r\nrecruited among Erse-speaking Irishmen. The admiral was early informed\r\nof what had happened in the Channel, and took his measures with vigour.\r\nAll visiting from ship to ship was stopped, even the captains being\r\nforbidden to ask one another to dinner. The marines were quartered\r\napart from the sailors, and the speaking of Irish was forbidden.\r\nJervis took the wise and bold course. He made no attempt to conceal\r\nthe news of the mutiny at home from his men. When the letter-bags were\r\nfound to contain circulars, written in a fair hand, inciting the crews\r\nto mutiny, he ordered them to be delivered. He trusted to his own\r\nvigilance and to the wholesome effects of occupation. The bombardments\r\nof Cadiz were at least partly undertaken to keep the men busy. Being a\r\nman of judgment, he looked to it carefully that his men were well fed.\r\nHe spared no pains to procure fresh food and vegetables from Morocco,\r\nso that his squadron was better provisioned and was in better health\r\nthan many ships had been in home ports. Under an admiral of this stamp\r\nmutiny had the least possible chance of coming to a head. Resolute\r\nofficers knew they would be supported, and the crews were saved from\r\nthe exasperation provoked by unfair treatment and unwholesome food.\r\nTherefore Jervis never had to deal with a general outbreak, as Bridport\r\nhad at Spithead, but only with the rebellious element represented by\r\nthe United Irishmen, or rascals of the stamp of Bott of the =Princess\r\nRoyal=, an agent of the Corresponding Society. A little firmness was\r\nenough to dispose of them. How completely this was the case was shown\r\nby the fact that Maitland of the =Kingfisher= (afterwards Maitland\r\nof the =Bellerophon=) suppressed disorder in his vessel by running\r\nthe first man who was mutinous to him through the heart, and Captain\r\nPearce of the =St. George=, with the help of his first lieutenant,\r\nHalley, was able to seize and put in irons two agitators who were rash\r\nenough to defy his authority. They were tried, condemned to death, and\r\nhanged next day. The admiral’s determination and his power to keep\r\norder were never doubted in his squadron. Among the vessels sent from\r\nthe Channel was the =London=, the vessel in which Lieutenant Bover had\r\nshot the mutineer. Bover had returned to his post, and it does not\r\nappear that the crew bore him any grudge. When the =London= came into\r\nthe Tagus, her captain, Purvis, went in his barge to report to the\r\nadmiral. While he was in the flagship, the =Ville de Paris=, one of his\r\nbarge’s crew, seeing a sailor looking out of a lower-deck port, sang\r\nout to him, “I say there, what have you fellows been doing while we\r\nhave been fighting for your beef and pork?” The sailor of the =Ville\r\nde Paris= gave him this friendly warning: “If you’ll take my advice,\r\nyou’ll say just nothing at all about all that here, for by G——d if\r\nold Jarvie hears ye, he’ll have you dingle dangle at the yardarm at\r\neight o’clock to-morrow morning.” The crisis of the disorder was the\r\nso-called mutiny of the =Marlborough=. This vessel had come out from\r\nEngland, where an outbreak quelled with some difficulty had taken place\r\nin her. A court martial was held on the principal mutineers, and one\r\nof them was condemned to death. Jervis, who had a keen sense of the\r\nvalue of an imposing spectacle, determined to make an example. He gave\r\norders that the execution should be carried out next morning, although\r\nit was a Sunday, and by the crew of the =Marlborough=—not, as was the\r\ncustom, by a boat’s crew from another ship. Captain Ellison, of the\r\n=Marlborough=, an old officer who had lost an arm in action, went to\r\nthe flagship to protest, and was received by Jervis very theatrically\r\non the quarter-deck of the =Ville de Paris=, in the presence of all\r\nher officers. Jervis refused either to postpone the execution or to\r\nallow it to be performed in the usual way. With a brutal ostentation of\r\nauthority, not unusual with him, he insulted Ellison by asking him if\r\nhe was afraid, by threatening to send an officer to supersede him, and\r\nby jeering at his age. Ellison was compelled to endure the insolence\r\nof the admiral. He returned to the =Marlborough=, and next morning the\r\nexecution took place in sight of all the fleet. A large force of armed\r\nboats was sent under Captain Campbell of the =Blenheim= with orders\r\nto lie alongside the =Marlborough= and fire into her if any disorder\r\ntook place on board. The mutineer was brought to the cathead, and\r\nthe rope was put round his neck. At eight o’clock the signal gun was\r\nfired from the flagship, and the man was swung off. By some horrible\r\npiece of neglect the tackle had been so badly fitted that it would\r\nnot work properly, and the man had to be lowered. For a moment it was\r\nthought that the crew had broken into mutiny, and Campbell brought his\r\nboats nearer. But the defect was quickly put right, and the execution\r\nwas completed. Then Jervis, who had been watching the scene from his\r\nflagship, said, “Discipline is preserved, sir.”\r\n\r\nNo account of the year of mutiny would be complete without at least\r\nsome record of the story of the =Hermione= frigate. It was a case in\r\nwhich a badly constituted crew was driven frantic by a captain of\r\nmanifestly inhuman violence and brutality. The mutiny occurred in\r\nSeptember in the West Indies. Pigot, the captain, was an officer of no\r\nmark. He seems to have been one of those men in whom the exercise of\r\nauthority and seclusion from the check of criticism by equals permit\r\nthe development of moral putrefaction. It is difficult to write on\r\nthat subject without touching on things which are _tacenda_. There\r\nwas in the sea life of long confinement to the ship and long solitary\r\ncruises an underworld of the brutal lust generated among segregated\r\nmen. The power to torture by flogging bred the foul love of inflicting\r\ntorture which is never far from lust. It is a stock, and as it seems,\r\na true story that Pigot, growing more and more frantic in cruelty,\r\nended by threatening to flog the last men off the yards when the sails\r\nwere handled. Two fell in their hurry to come down, and were killed by\r\ntheir fall on the deck. Pigot ordered the bodies of “the lubbers” to\r\nbe thrown overboard. That night “hell broke loose” in the =Hermione=.\r\nThe crew rose in revolt. Pigot was beaten down in his cabin and hurled\r\noverboard, all the commissioned officers were butchered—some of them\r\nwhile piteously appealing for mercy for the sake of their wives and\r\nchildren. The gunner, the carpenter, and one midshipman only were\r\nspared. It is recorded that the boatswain was given over to be tortured\r\nby the ship’s boys, and that they killed him slowly by scraping his\r\nflesh from his bones with dumbscrapers. Then the mutineers took the\r\nship into La Guayra, and handed her over to the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nIt has been counted a signal example of the good fortune of England\r\nthat the French made no attempt to profit by the disorganisation of\r\nthe fleet during all these months of 1797. Some ridicule has been\r\ndirected in France against members of the Directory who thought\r\ninterference would be injudicious, since it would only tend to reunite\r\nthe English. Yet the Frenchmen who judged thus judged rightly. There\r\nwas no general disloyalty to the State among the mutineers. If there\r\nhad been, what could have prevented the mutineers from taking the ships\r\nto Brest, or the Texel? If they shrank from going over to the enemy,\r\nthey could still have sailed to America, for they were provisioned\r\nfor long blockades, and there were men among them who could navigate.\r\nIn the United States they would have found a safe refuge in an\r\nEnglish-speaking community. They rose only against grievances. They did\r\nnot attain all they wished, but they obtained a part, and they shocked\r\ntheir rulers into beginning to improve the conditions of their service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE NILE\r\n\r\n AUTHORITIES.—See Chapter XII., and _La Jonquière Expedition d’Egypte_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe failure of Hoche, the defeat of the proposed combination with the\r\nSpaniards by the battle of St. Vincent, the shattering of the Dutch\r\nfleet at Camperdown, had proved that an invasion of the British Isles\r\nwas a venture only to be achieved by such a combination of good fortune\r\nfor the French, and bad management on our part, as no sane ruler of men\r\ncould expect. Yet during eight years, including the short fallacious\r\nPeace of Amiens, the successive Governments of France, the Directory,\r\nthe Consulate, and the Empire continued to make the attempt. All their\r\nefforts at sea and some of their enterprises on land were directed to\r\nthat end. The expedition to Egypt in 1798 was as much a part of the\r\ninvasion scheme as the raid of Humbert. It was meant to turn the flank\r\nof England by assailing her in India. The Northern Coalition of 1801\r\nwas but another plot to turn England’s flank—promoted by the French,\r\nand made possible by the help of her erratic ally, the Czar Paul. The\r\nBoulogne flotilla was to have made the direct attack. It was all one\r\nundivided story which ended in 1805—leaving behind it a heritage of\r\nmadness in the shape of Napoleon’s maniacal determination to conquer\r\nEngland on the Continent—in other words, to make the independence\r\nand well-being of Europe incompatible with the existence of his own\r\ngovernment. The army of England was not dissolved. It remained rather a\r\npaper than an effective force, but still in existence as a possibility\r\nand a threat. As if to emphasise their determination to strike at the\r\nheart of England, the Directory appointed Napoleon himself as general\r\nof the Army of England on the 26th October 1797. The nomination was\r\nlittle more than a formality. Napoleon did not even visit his command\r\ntill early in February 1798, and then only in passing and on his way\r\nto Belgium. The conqueror of Italy did not need his great sagacity to\r\nsee that the venture was insane with such resources as the Directory\r\ncould command. In the month of May their coast defence forces led\r\nby Muskeyn were beaten in an effort to retake the Marcouf islands,\r\noff La Hougue, where England had an advance post of observation held\r\nby bluejackets and marines. Napoleon, who knew well enough that the\r\nDirectory feared him as a possible military despot, was no more\r\ndisposed than Hoche to play Don Quixote on the sea to please men who\r\nwould gladly have seen him at the bottom of it. He turned to the great\r\nflanking movement which was to destroy England through India, leaving\r\nlesser, and less fortunate, men to tilt at windmills.\r\n\r\nThe turning movement was essentially no less a delusion than the direct\r\nattack, but it looked feasible, it offered promising vistas of glory\r\nand adventure in the East, and it gave Napoleon a field wherein he\r\nmight do showy things to fascinate the French imagination, and withal\r\nbide his time. It was indeed feasible up to a certain point, because\r\nthe British Mediterranean fleet was tied down to blockade Cadiz.\r\nJervis, content with heading off and driving back the Spaniards, had\r\nretired first to Lagos, and then to Lisbon, carrying with him his four\r\nprizes, the cherished reward of the toils and perils of officers and\r\nmen, to be divided in becoming proportions. What those proportions were\r\nwe can learn pleasantly from the estimate made by Nelson in a letter\r\nto Lord Spencer dated 7th September, of what the shares due for three\r\nFrench prizes he caused to be destroyed would have come to, if he had\r\nordered their preservation:—to the commander-in-chief £3750; to the\r\njunior admirals each £1625; to captains each £1000; to the lieutenants\r\nclass each £75; to warrant officers each £50; to petty officers each\r\n£11; to seamen and marines each £2, 4s. 1d. The men had their share to\r\na penny, and we can understand the jest of the Irish sailor who was\r\nseen saying his prayers before Trafalgar. When asked by a lieutenant if\r\nhe was afraid, he answered that he was not, but was only praying that\r\nthe enemy’s bullets might be distributed on the same scale as the prize\r\nmoney—the lion’s share to the officers. St. Vincent, as he must now be\r\ncalled, did not leave Lisbon till the 31st March, and then applied\r\nhimself to watching the twenty-six or twenty-eight Spanish ships in the\r\nport and to that repression of the spirit of mutiny described in the\r\nprevious chapter.\r\n\r\nCadiz was twice bombarded at night. On the 3rd and the 5th July\r\nsome damage was done to shipping and to houses. Some conflicts took\r\nplace with Spanish guard-boats and galleys, in one of which Nelson\r\nwas in great peril. News came that a Spanish treasure-ship had taken\r\nrefuge at Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and on the 15th July Nelson was\r\ndetached to seize it. He had with him his flagship the =Theseus=,\r\n74, the =Culloden=, 74, the =Zealous=, 74, and the =Leander=, 50,\r\nwith the =Seahorse=, =Emerald=, and =Terpsichore=, 32-gun frigates,\r\nand the cutter =Fox=. But he was not provided with the detachment\r\nof troops he thought necessary. Mainly for want of them, the attack\r\nfailed disastrously. On the 22nd July an attempt was made to occupy\r\na height overhanging the town, but the post was too strongly held to\r\nbe carried by a mere landing party. On the evening of the 24th and\r\nin the small hours of the 25th, a double direct attack on the mole,\r\nand by the Citadel, was made with the =Fox= and boats. The =Fox= was\r\nsunk by cannon-shot off the mole, and so were some of the boats with\r\nher. Nelson lost his right arm. A few officers and men struggled on\r\nto the mole only to be shot down by musketry. The attack near the\r\nCitadel was no more fortunate. Troubridge, who commanded, succeeded in\r\nlanding through the surf which stove his boats, but only to find he was\r\nhelpless and to be compelled to purchase leave to return to the ships\r\nby promising that no further attack should be made on the islands. We\r\nlost in all 141 men and officers shot or drowned, and 105 wounded.\r\nNelson was compelled to return home to months of suffering. From April\r\n1797 to May 1798 the Mediterranean was unvisited by an English naval\r\nforce, the French were free to cross it in every direction to fix their\r\ngrip on the Ionian Islands, their share of the plunder of Venice, and\r\nto prepare for their great venture. Jervis, who spent much of his time\r\nat Lisbon, was joined by a Portuguese squadron, but the necessity for\r\nwatching the Spaniards kept him to the west of the Straits.\r\n\r\nTherefore did it seem feasible to the French to apply themselves to\r\nthe profitable task of turning the Mediterranean into “a French lake,”\r\nby seizing Egypt, and then to revenge themselves on England by making\r\nEgypt the starting place for an attack on India. Preparations were made\r\nall through the earlier part of the year, and the expedition might have\r\nsailed before it did if an alarm of renewed war with Austria had not\r\nturned the attention of the French Government to another direction. The\r\nEnglish ministers knew that preparations were being made, but did not\r\nknow for what particular purpose. It seemed not improbable, though it\r\nsurely ought to have appeared unthinkable, that the fleet at Toulon was\r\ngoing to try to run past Jervis and make for Ireland, where rebellion\r\nhad broken out. There were from thirty to forty French ships of the\r\nline at Brest and other ocean ports, and the Army of England was still\r\nin being, at least on paper. To go to see what was being done at Toulon\r\nwas the obvious course.\r\n\r\nNelson returned from home to the fleet off Cadiz on the 29th April\r\n1798. Lord Spencer, the First Lord of the Admiralty, guided by his\r\nown good sense and the advice of Sir Gilbert Elliot, Lord Minto,\r\nhad already selected him as the officer to be entrusted with the\r\nduty of intercepting the Toulon armament. His judgment coincided\r\nwith the opinion of Jervis, who spontaneously detached Nelson on a\r\nreconnaissance into the Mediterranean on the 2nd May. Nelson sailed\r\nin his flagship, the =Vanguard=, 74, and on the 4th he picked up, at\r\nGibraltar, the =Alexander=, 74, the =Orion=, 74, the =Emerald= and\r\n=Terpsichore=, and the =Bonne Citoyenne= sloop. On the 9th he sailed\r\nfor Toulon. On the 19th St. Vincent received orders from home to send\r\ntwelve line-of-battle ships into the Mediterranean to destroy the\r\nFrench armament, and he was recommended to give the command to Nelson.\r\nHe was promised reinforcements to replace the ships he detached. They\r\nreached him on the 24th, under command of Sir R. Curtis, and that night\r\nthe inshore squadron watching Cadiz, was replaced, under cover of the\r\ndark, by the newcomers, and was detached up the Mediterranean so that\r\nthe Spaniards should see nothing to excite their suspicions and give\r\nthem news to report to the French.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Nelson had gone ahead and had been off Cape Sicié on\r\nthe 17th. He learnt from a captured privateer that a great armament was\r\nindeed in preparation, but could learn nothing of its destination. On\r\nthe 21st the =Vanguard= was dismasted in a north-westerly gale, which\r\nhad begun to blow on the 19th, and was compelled to anchor to refit\r\nat San Pietro in Sardinia. His ships had been seen at a distance by\r\nthe French in Toulon, but they put to sea on the 19th by favour of the\r\nnorth-west wind which drove him off. The armament consisted of twelve\r\nsail of the line under Admiral Brueys d’Aigalliers, an officer of the\r\nold French royal corps. The warships were crowded with Napoleon’s\r\ntroops, and accompanied by transports. The French warships as usual\r\nhad been manned with difficulty, and were short-handed. Though three\r\nmonths’ provisions were carried for the soldiers, only two months’ were\r\ncarried for the crews, a fact which had an influence on the movements\r\nof Brueys later on. Immediately after leaving Toulon the armament was\r\njoined by a convoy from Genoa on the 21st May. The north-westerly gale\r\nblew it on its course, and as it went down the eastern side of Corsica\r\nand Sardinia it was sheltered from the violence of the storm. On the\r\n27th it was joined at the mouth of the Straits of Bonifacio by another\r\nconvoy from Ajaccio, while a third from Civita Vecchia, followed a\r\nparallel course, and joined the main body off Malta on the 9th June.\r\nIf the fleet of Jervis had not been tied down to watch Cadiz, it would\r\nhave been easy to prevent the army for the invasion of Egypt from\r\never coming together. The possession of Malta, in the opinion of the\r\nFrench, who share the common belief of mankind that whoever holds a\r\nport commands the sea about it, would have gone far to forward their\r\nscheme for making the Mediterranean a French lake. The Order of St.\r\nJohn of Jerusalem, to which it belonged, had been nearly ruined by the\r\nloss of its estates in France during the Revolution, and was too poor\r\nto maintain troops. The French army took possession on the 13th June,\r\nand on the 18th sailed on its way to Egypt, leaving a garrison in the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nWhile the French were profiting by the delay of the English to take\r\nearly measures to intercept them, Nelson was refitting at San Pietro.\r\nOn the 27th May, the day on which the Ajaccio Convoy joined Brueys and\r\nNapoleon, he left San Pietro to resume his watch off Toulon. He was\r\nback on his cruising ground on the 31st to learn that the armament\r\nwas gone to a destination he could not discover. On the 5th Captain\r\nHardy, of the =Mutine= brig, brought him the news that Troubridge was\r\ncoming with reinforcements, which would raise his command to fourteen\r\nsail. On the 7th they joined him. In a time when the movements of ships\r\nwere controlled by the wind the seaman had certainties on which to\r\ncalculate. Nelson knew that a fleet hampered by a swarm of transports\r\ncould not have gone westward in the late north-westerly gale. Therefore\r\nhe sought them on the east of Corsica and Sardinia. When off Gianute\r\nhe was misinformed by a Moorish vessel, which told him that the French\r\nwere at Syracuse. At Naples, on the 17th June—four days after the\r\nFrench had taken Malta—he learnt that the enemy had gone south past\r\nSardinia. At Messina, on the 20th, he heard of the capture of Malta and\r\nGozo. On the 22nd he was twelve leagues to the S.W. of Cape Passaro\r\nin Sicily, and was there told by a neutral, who had seen them at sea,\r\nthat the French had left Malta on the 18th and were going to the east.\r\nNapoleon was as little a friend to delay as Nelson. He knew since the\r\n1st June of the presence of English ships at San Pietro, and that he\r\nwas liable to interruption. Knowing that he pressed on, but did not\r\ntake the normal course from Malta to Alexandria. He followed a route\r\nto the north of it along the southern shore of Crete. When therefore\r\nNelson, concluding most justly that the French would not go east except\r\nto attack Egypt, pressed on in pursuit along the shortest line, he\r\ncrossed the route of his enemy, and they sailed in parallel lines. On\r\nthe 25th, when the French were off Gozo di Candia, Nelson was directly\r\nto the south of them, barely sixty miles away, near Cape Dernah, in\r\nAfrica. As he was not weighted by transports and was sailing on the\r\nmore direct route he headed his opponent, and reached Alexandria on\r\nthe 28th June to find the port empty, and the Turks wholly ignorant\r\nthat they were menaced by any danger. He was in a fever of excitement.\r\nOf eager, vehement temperament, and by nature a striker of fierce\r\nstrokes, he had overshot the mark, and his blow had been wasted in the\r\nair. His frigates had parted from him in the gale which dismasted the\r\n=Vanguard=, and had not rejoined. He was groping for his foe in the\r\ndark, and had missed him. His mind was agitated by his imagination. He\r\nsaw himself, in his first important command, chosen over the heads of\r\nhis seniors to meet a great crisis, and it seemed as if he had failed.\r\nHe already heard in fancy the howl of disappointment which would go up\r\nin England, worded with all the ruffian fluency of the newspapers; and\r\nhe loved honour—he loved popularity. Agitation clouded his sagacity. He\r\ncould not consider how probable it was that his unhampered squadron had\r\npassed the enemy, how unlikely it was that they were heading for any\r\nother point than Egypt, an old object of French ambition, a post from\r\nwhich India could be menaced. On the 29th he hurried away to the coast\r\nof Anatolia, from the place where British interests could be injured,\r\nto one where the French could have gone only in a fit of childish\r\nfolly. Forty-eight hours after he had left, and when his topsails were\r\nhardly over the horizon to the north-east, the French were seen in the\r\nwest, and the invasion of Egypt began.\r\n\r\nIt was allowed to go on for a month undisturbed, and Napoleon was at\r\nliberty to gain the victories which prepared the way for his rise to\r\ndespotic power in France. Nelson, meanwhile, had reached the coast\r\nof Anatolia on the 4th July, had battled his way back against head\r\nwinds to Cape Passaro by the 18th, had obtained water and stores at\r\nSyracuse by the connivance of the Neapolitan Government and in defiance\r\nof its treaty with France, and had gone to sea again by the 25th,\r\nstill ignorant of the whereabouts of his enemies save that they were\r\nsomewhere in the Levant. On the 28th the Turkish Pasha at Coron, in the\r\nMorea, told him that they had been seen four weeks before to the south\r\nof Crete, heading to the south-east. That they had gone to Egypt did\r\nnot admit of a doubt. Nelson steered once more for Alexandria, and on\r\nthe 1st August the =Zealous= signalled that the French were at anchor\r\nin Aboukir Bay to the west of the Rosetta mouth of the Nile.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had preferred to keep the squadron on the coast to co-operate\r\nwith his army, though he gave the admiral conditional leave to sail\r\nfor Corfu, if he could not take his fleet into the old harbour of\r\nAlexandria or find a safe anchorage elsewhere on the coast. Brueys\r\ncould not leave for Corfu even if the general had been honest in giving\r\nhim leave to go, for he was short of water and provisions, and most of\r\nwhat the shore could supply was taken for the army. To get into the old\r\nharbour was difficult. To get out of it in the face of a blockading\r\nforce would have been impossible. A squadron once shut in it might be\r\ndestroyed by bombs. So he sought for a safe anchorage and thought he\r\nfound it at Aboukir, to the N.E. of Alexandria. Aboukir, the ancient\r\nCanopus, is the western point of the bay which lies west of the Rosetta\r\nbranch of the Nile, and it has a shallow harbour stretching from N.W.\r\nto S.E. with an island at the N.W. point. Brueys, as an officer of the\r\nold royal corps, serving revolutionary France from necessity, disliked\r\nhis captains as members of the class which had ruined and degraded\r\nhis own. He thought them boors, and knew them to be ignorant. He had\r\nno confidence in his command, for his ships were all short-handed,\r\nand several lacked a fourth or even a third of their complement. The\r\nproportion of genuine seamen was small and the discipline bad. No\r\npractice could be given while the ships were crowded with soldiers and\r\nmilitary stores. When the ships were cleared of the army there had\r\nbeen little time to drill the men, and little will on their part to be\r\ndrilled, for the anarchical spirit of the Revolution was strong among\r\nthem, and it was difficult to secure obedience. Therefore Brueys was\r\njustified in believing that his squadron was unequal to an encounter\r\nwith an English force of approximately the same strength. His wisest\r\ncourse was to meet battle, if meet it he must, in conditions which\r\nwould put the least possible strain on its weakness. The measures he\r\ntook say little for the military intelligence of the famous royal\r\ncorps. He might have placed his ships at the N.W. corner of the bay,\r\nclose to the bank which lines the shore, and where the English could\r\nnot place ships on both sides of his. He did anchor them so far from\r\nthe bank that there was room for an enemy to pass between them and\r\nthe land, and he arranged them in a very obtuse angle, with its apex\r\npointing to the N.E. If an attack was made at either end, the other\r\nwould not be able to support the part assailed. The history of war\r\ncontains no more tragic example of a force weak in itself and so\r\nhandled that all the causes of defeat were heaped upon its weakness.\r\nAnd this was done in the face of an English squadron trained in a fine\r\nschool of discipline, rendered confident by long success, perfected\r\nby practice in nerve and judgment, led by that man of all men who\r\nwas best qualified to give its strength free play. One of the most\r\nidle of idle discussions has chattered round the imaginary problem\r\nwhether the course of doubling on the head of the French line, actually\r\nadopted by the English fleet, was taken by Nelson’s order or inspired\r\nby the example of Captain Foley of the =Goliath=. It was perhaps\r\nthe greatest of Nelson’s great qualities, his truest claim to be a\r\nconsummate leader of men, that he lived in genial harmony with his\r\nsubordinates, discussing all possible contingencies with them, laying\r\ndown the principles, and leaving to every man the inspiring freedom to\r\nco-operate within the just bounds of his duty, to act as circumstances\r\nserved in the spirit of his orders, as a free man, and not as one\r\nbound to follow the letter like a mere instrument. Whether the French\r\nline would be doubled on must depend on its position at the moment\r\nof battle. The advantage of doubling and putting an opponent between\r\ntwo fires had been obvious to average human intelligence from of old.\r\nOn a previous page of this book it has been shown how Tourville did\r\nit at the battle of Beachy Head. The manœuvre, like all the work of\r\nman, fell short of perfection. There was a risk that when two ships\r\nwere firing into a third placed between them they would fire into one\r\nanother. It was a risk which weighed with good officers, notably with\r\nCaptain Saumarez of the =Orion=. He thought that, given the superiority\r\nof our gunnery, we developed a superior force whenever an English\r\nship came into action with a French ship of the same rate or one not\r\ngreatly superior in armament. It is possible that part of the loss\r\nsuffered by the English squadron was inflicted by English hands. It\r\nis a not incredible might-have-been, that if our ships had stretched\r\nalong the outside of the French line, each anchoring as she came up and\r\ncovering the passage of the comrade behind, we might have reached their\r\nrear ships before they got away, and so have taken them all. But the\r\nadvantages of the course followed were palpable. It was certain that\r\nthe French ships, attacked on both sides, would be rapidly crushed,\r\nfor their insufficient crews were overtaxed when compelled to fight\r\nboth broadsides. The nominal strength of the crews of the French ships\r\nwas 11,000 men. Their actual force was 7850. Twenty-five men per ship\r\nwere absent guarding the watering place on shore, and many were away in\r\nthe boats engaged in bringing off water when the English appeared.\r\n\r\nThey had sighted the coast of Egypt about Alexandria on the morning of\r\nthe 1st August. The =Alexander=, 74, Captain Ball, and =Swiftsure=,\r\n74, Captain Hallowell, were sent in to reconnoitre, and reported\r\nat 10 a.m. that they saw the harbour full of vessels, but that the\r\nFrench squadron was not there. At 1 p.m. the =Zealous=, 74, Captain\r\nSamuel Hood, signalled that the enemy was at anchor in Aboukir. The\r\n=Swiftsure= and =Alexander= were recalled, and the squadron headed for\r\nthe enemy. By about 5.30 it was to the north of Aboukir Island, which,\r\nfrom the battle of the night, was to receive the name of Nelson Island.\r\nThe Mediterranean charts of the time were generally untrustworthy,\r\nand seamen had to rely on their own observation to learn the depths\r\nof water. Nelson hailed the =Zealous= to ask of Captain Hood if he\r\nthought the ships could turn with the security that they would clear\r\nthe shoal. Hood replied that he did not know, but would stand in and\r\ntry. The orders were to attack the enemy’s van and centre, and to\r\nanchor. It was at six o’clock that the order was given to stand in,\r\nand the squadron which had come from the west turned to the south to\r\nthrow itself on the French van. At that moment eleven ship were in\r\nline. The =Goliath=, 74, Captain Foley; =Zealous=, 74, Captain Samuel\r\nHood; =Orion=, 74, Captain Sir James Saumarez; =Audacious=, 74, Captain\r\nDavidge Gould; =Theseus=, 74, Captain Miller; =Vanguard=, 74, Nelson’s\r\nflagship, of which Edward Berry was captain; =Minotaur=, 74, Captain\r\nLouis; =Defence=, 74, Captain Peyton; =Bellerophon=, 74, Captain Darby;\r\n=Majestic=, 74, Captain Westcott; and the =Leander=, 50, Captain\r\nThompson. The =Culloden=, 74, Captain Troubridge, always an unlucky\r\nship, was outsailed and was behind, and the =Alexander= and =Swiftsure=\r\nwere still further off.\r\n\r\nThe French squadron consisted of thirteen vessels and was anchored\r\nas follows:—The _Guerrier_, 74, a very old ship, Captain Trullet,\r\nwas at the head, and lay nearly two miles to the south-east of\r\nAboukir island. Behind her and stretching to the south-east lay the\r\n_Conquerant_, 74, Captain Dalbarade, a vessel so rotten with age that\r\nher armament had been reduced, and manned by a crew of only four\r\nhundred. The _Spartiate_, 74, Captain Eimeriau; the _Aquilon_, 74,\r\nCaptain Thevenard; and the _Peuple Souverain_, 74, Captain Raccord,\r\nwhich was as much worn out as the _Conquerant_. The _Franklin_, 80,\r\nCaptain Gillet, the flagship of Rear-Admiral Blanquet Duchayla, and the\r\n_Orient_, 110, the flagship of Admiral Brueys, whose flag-captain was\r\nCasabianca, and who had with him Ganteaume as captain of the fleet.\r\nThe line turned to the south beyond the _Orient_, and consisted of the\r\n_Tonnant_, 80, Captain Dupetit Thouard; the _Heureux_, 74, Captain\r\nEtienne; the _Mercure_, 74, Captain Cambon; the _Guillaume Tell_, 80,\r\nflagship of Rear-Admiral Villeneuve, whose flag-captain was Saunier;\r\nthe _Généreux_, 74, Captain Lejoille; and the _Timoléon_, 74, Captain\r\nLéonce Trullet. Four frigates of forty guns were anchored inside the\r\nline, and one of them carried the flag of Rear-Admiral Decrès. When\r\nNelson was sighted by the French at 2 p.m. a hasty council of war was\r\nheld in the _Orient_. There was discussion what ought to be done,\r\nthough lack of means and of time forbade the doing of anything save one\r\nthing—that was to lie and wait for the English attack in the hope that\r\nit would not be made till next morning, and with the expectation that\r\nit would not be made on the van, though that, as being the windward\r\nend of the squadron, was precisely the point at which attack would be\r\nmost effective, and least liable to interruption by the French ships to\r\nleeward.\r\n\r\nThe attack was made that night, and was made on the van. At six\r\no’clock, just as the sun was touching the horizon, the =Goliath=\r\ncrossed the bow of the _Guerrier_, pouring in her fire with such effect\r\nthat the Frenchman’s foremast came down. The men on the deck of the\r\n=Goliath=, who could see that they had drawn the first blood, cheered\r\nthe happy omen, and the cheer was taken up by the crews at the guns\r\nbelow. The =Goliath= was to have been anchored with a spring at her\r\ncable, abreast of the _Guerrier_, but the anchor did not hold, and she\r\nwas brought up abreast of the _Conquerant_. The =Zealous= followed\r\nin her wake and took the place she had failed to hold abreast of the\r\n_Guerrier_. The =Orion= followed, and, passing inside of the =Goliath=\r\nand =Zealous= (so wide was the space between the French ships and the\r\nshoal water), anchored by the _Spartiate_. The =Audacious= came along\r\nthe same track and anchored by the _Peuple Souverain_. The =Theseus=\r\npassed astern of the _Guerrier_, through the overwide interval of 150\r\nmetres between the French ships, and ahead of the _Conquerant_, then\r\nswept inside of her comrades and assailed the _Aquilon_. Nelson came\r\ninto action behind the =Theseus=, but passed outside the French line,\r\nand, neglecting the already overpowered _Guerrier_ and _Conquerant_,\r\nanchored on the starboard side of the _Spartiate_ which was already\r\nattacked on the port side by the =Orion=. The =Minotaur= passed outside\r\nthe =Vanguard= and joined the =Theseus= in firing into the _Aquilon_.\r\nThe =Defence= came on behind the =Minotaur= and assailed the _Peuple\r\nSouverain_. She had no colleague, but the French ship was so weak as\r\nto be hardly able to fire her guns without danger to herself and was\r\nno formidable antagonist. Thus eight English ships were in action with\r\nfive French, of which three were more or less unfit to be in a line of\r\nbattle. So the French van was rapidly crushed and the victory was won.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the French squadron was not to be completed with the\r\nsame ease. The next in order to the _Peuple Souverain_ in the French\r\nline was the _Franklin_, 80, next to her came the _Orient_, 110, and\r\nthe _Tonnant_, 80. These three powerful ships formed, as it were,\r\na central citadel to the French line, and our most severe loss was\r\nsuffered in action with them. The =Bellerophon=, which followed the\r\n=Vanguard=, passed the _Franklin_, and came under the broadside of the\r\n_Orient_. The =Majestic= went beyond the =Bellerophon= and came into\r\naction with the _Tonnant_. Both were severely mauled. The =Bellerophon=\r\nwas shattered by the fire of the _Orient_, and drifted off down the\r\nbay. The =Majestic= was fiercely dealt with by the _Tonnant_, fell\r\naway from her, and became entangled with the next in the line, the\r\n_Heureux_. The _Heureux’s_ captain, Etienne, had called up his men to\r\nrepel boarders, or to board, when the =Majestic= broke away and was\r\nbrought up beside the _Mercure_. These two ships suffered far more\r\nseverely than any of the others engaged. The =Bellerophon= lost 49\r\nmen killed and 148 wounded. The =Majestic=, 50, killed, including her\r\ncaptain Westcott, and 143 wounded. Between them they suffered a greater\r\nloss than all the ships of Jervis’s squadron at the battle of Cape St.\r\nVincent. But now the vessels which had not been near enough to take\r\npart in the first attack began to come in. The =Swiftsure= attacked the\r\n_Franklin_ and the =Alexander=, _L’Orient_. They were joined by the\r\nlittle =Leander= which had been delayed by her efforts to drag off the\r\never unlucky =Culloden=, which had grounded on the Aboukir shoal. The\r\n=Leander= anchored ahead of the _Franklin_ and raked both her and the\r\n_Orient_. As the fire in the French van ceased by the surrender of the\r\noverpowered ships, our vessels dropped down and helped to crush the\r\nenemy’s centre. They were aided by the frightful disaster which befell\r\nthe _Orient_. She caught fire and blew up. The French ships beyond\r\nher cut their cables and drifted away. The isolated _Franklin_ fought\r\nlong and gallantly but was overpowered at last. In the French rear\r\nVilleneuve, hesitating, contemplating difficulties, thinking of safety\r\nand seeking it not by grasping the nettle, but by evasion, as he was to\r\ndo seven years later, did nothing to help his comrades. He thought it\r\nmuch that he could escape next morning with his flagship the _Guillaume\r\nTell_, the _Généreux_ and two frigates. Nelson, who had been wounded\r\nin the head by a langrage shot while engaged with the _Aquilon_,\r\nthought, that if he had not been disabled, even they would have been\r\ntaken. But the case was indeed one for saying they had done very well.\r\nDuring the night and the following morning all the French ships, except\r\nVilleneuve’s four, were taken or destroyed. Brueys fell on the deck of\r\nhis flagship. The total loss of the French is difficult to estimate. It\r\nhas been put by themselves at 1451 killed and 1479 wounded. The loss in\r\nNelson’s squadron was 218 killed and 678 wounded, and to that total of\r\n896, the =Bellerophon= and the =Majestic= contributed 390. Of the ships\r\nwhich were active in crushing the van the =Zealous= lost only 1 killed\r\nand 7 wounded, the =Theseus= 4 killed and 7 wounded, the =Defence= 4\r\nkilled and 11 wounded, while the =Leander= had only 14 men wounded and\r\nnone killed.\r\n\r\nSix days after the great turning movement had been wrecked in Aboukir\r\nBay, the attack on England from the ocean ports of France began to be\r\nput into execution. It was to be directed through Ireland, and was to\r\nbe double. One squadron under Savary was ordered to carry troops from\r\nRochefort, while another and stronger squadron was to carry a division\r\nfrom Brest. Combined operations are liable to fail from obstacles which\r\nupset the most promising combination, and this was no exception to a\r\ncommon experience. Savary did indeed sail unseen from Rochefort on the\r\n6th of August. He reached Killala Bay, between Sligo and Mayo, on the\r\n21st. He had with him the _Concorde_, 40, the _Franchise_, 36, the\r\n_Medée_, 36, and the _Venus_, 28, and they carried General Humbert, an\r\nofficer of much spirit and ingenuity, and 1150 soldiers. Now, as for\r\nthe raid Humbert made, the victory he won at Castlebar, his surrender\r\nat Ballinamuck, and the difficulty he said he found in discovering a\r\nreal general among the many English officers of that title he heard of,\r\nare they not written in the books of the chronicles of Ireland? The\r\nstory inspires a profound gratitude to the Providence which confined\r\nthe invasion to Humbert and 1150 men, and spared us Hoche with ten\r\ntimes (or more) that number. Having landed his charge, Savary was\r\nquickly away on the 23rd and anchored safely at Royan, in the Gironde,\r\non the 9th September, from whence he returned to Rochefort on the 20th.\r\n\r\nBompard, who was to sail from Brest, was not so fortunate. His start\r\nwas delayed first by want of money, for the finances of France were\r\nstill in such a distressed state that the Government could not send\r\nhim so small a sum as £6000 to pay the soldiers, and the men refused\r\nto sail without an advance. Then there was an alarm of an English\r\ninroad into Holland, and troops were held back to meet that danger.\r\nBut the worst obstacle was the watch of the English blockading fleet.\r\nIts frigates cruised in the Iroise, and the line-of-battle ships were\r\nat hand. Bompard made one attempt to get away by the passage between\r\nthe Black Rocks and Ushant, saw Bridport ahead of him, and went back.\r\nDuring the night of the 16th September he did get away, for though\r\nthe wind blew strongly from the N.E. off shore, Bridport had taken his\r\nships away to the northward of Ushant. So Bompard was free to sail out\r\nthrough the Raz du Sein to the southward, under cover of the dark. Next\r\nmorning he was clear of the land in hazy weather, but he saw, and was\r\nseen, by the =Ethalion= frigate, Captain Countess, who had with him the\r\n=Boadicea= frigate, Captain R. Keats, and the brig =Sylph=, Captain\r\nWhite. They were between him and the Bee du Raz. Captain Countess\r\nattached himself to the French squadron, which consisted of the\r\n_Hoche_, 74 (the old Pégase), the _Immortalité_, _Romaine_, _Loire_,\r\n_Bellone_, _Coquille_, _Embuscade_, _Resolue_, and _Semillante_\r\nfrigates and a schooner. The squadron carried 3000 troops under\r\nGenerals Hardy and Ménage. Captain Countess despatched the =Boadicea=\r\nto warn Bridport, who, after looking into the Iroise to obtain the\r\nevidence of his own eyes, sent warning home that a French squadron had\r\nescaped what a very polite fiction would call his vigilance.\r\n\r\nThe =Ethalion= followed Bompard, retiring when menaced, and coming back\r\nagain when the French went on. Bompard took the seeming cautious, but\r\nin reality very rash, course of endeavouring to shake off his pursuer\r\nby steering wide out to the south. He could hardly have provided\r\nmore effectually for his own defeat. His one chance of success (and\r\nit was a poor one now that Savary’s success had aroused his enemy’s\r\nvigilance and had turned his attention to the Irish Coast) was to head\r\nan intercepting force. Every hour he added to his voyage increased\r\nthe danger that he would be intercepted, and he was. When Bridport’s\r\nmessage reached England Sir J. B. Warren was sent from Cawsand Bay\r\nto the west coast of Ireland to bar the road. He sailed on the 23rd\r\nSeptember, and on the 10th October was off Achill Head. If Bompard had\r\ngone direct to his destination, Killala Bay, trusting, as from the\r\nnature of his task he had to trust, to fortune, he would have been\r\noff Tory Island some days before Warren was in a position to attack\r\nhim, and might have landed Hardy in Killala Bay. As he preferred to\r\ntry artful management, where speed and boldness were wanted, he was\r\nsighted on the 11th October, near the Island, by Warren, who then had\r\nwith him the =Canada=, 74, =Robust=, 74, =Foudroyant=, 80, =Magnanime=,\r\n=Ethalion=, =Anson=, =Melampus=, and =Amelia= frigates. The English\r\nofficer pursued and overtook his enemy on the following day. The\r\n_Hoche_, Bompard’s one line-of-battle ship, was easily overpowered, and\r\nsix of the frigates with her were captured in a succession of fights\r\noff the west coast of Ireland. The utmost audacity could have brought\r\nno worse fate on Bompard and his command.\r\n\r\nIsolated French ships reached the Irish coast—as, for instance, the\r\nbrig _Anacreon_, which in September visited the coast of Donegal,\r\nwent back on hearing of the surrender of Humbert, and returned to her\r\nstarting-point, Dunkirk, bringing a valuable prize with her. On the\r\n12th October Savary sailed again from Rochefort with a larger squadron\r\nand 1090 soldiers. He looked into Killala, found that a landing was\r\nhopeless, and went back to Rochefort. He was chased and had to throw\r\nguns overboard to lighten his vessels, but he got back safe.\r\n\r\nThe direct invasion scheme had broken down. Yet the whole story puts\r\nthese two questions—Did it break down because of the strength of our\r\nguard? What does the failure teach us to expect in the future? No\r\nfair-minded man can assert that fortune had no share in our success.\r\nHoche’s expedition would have succeeded as fully as the expedition\r\nof Savary and Humbert, but for some measure of bad management on the\r\npart of Morard de Galle, and the persistence of bad weather. Of the\r\nexpeditions of 1798, both of Savary’s reached the coast of Ireland and\r\nreturned in safety. So did the _Anacreon_. Bompard alone was defeated\r\nat sea. The most obvious lesson of it all is of course that better\r\nmanagement than Bridport’s will always be needed, and the better the\r\nenemy the greater the want. Other nations study these stories. We\r\nmust not take it for granted that a French Revolution will help us by\r\ndisorganising our foes.\r\n\r\nThe double failure in Egypt and on the coast of Ireland suspended all\r\nschemes of invasion for a time. France and England alike had their eyes\r\nfixed on Napoleon’s army in Egypt. The news of the disaster in Aboukir\r\nBay produced a profound effect throughout Europe. A storm broke out in\r\nFrance against the Directory, who were accused of having “deported”\r\nthe best general and the best army of the Republic. Public men who had\r\nbeen loud in promoting the expedition began to throw the blame for it\r\non one another. Public excitement and anger were aggravated by the\r\nspeedy discovery that a new coalition was forming, and that France\r\nwould again be called upon to fight for her very existence, at least\r\nfor all she had gained by the Revolution. To recover Napoleon and his\r\narmy became a leading object with the French. To keep them in Egypt\r\nwas no less the object of England. The best that could have happened\r\nwould have been that Napoleon should have made a serious attempt to\r\ncarry out his grand scheme of marching on the footsteps of Alexander\r\nthe Great, through Persia and Afghanistan to India. He would have\r\nperished on his march, and Europe would have escaped years of misery.\r\nBut to keep him away from the battlefields of Europe was a real gain.\r\nThe most effectual of all ways of doing this would have been to retain\r\na large force on the coast of Egypt, and send out troops. It was not\r\nthe course taken. Nelson sent the =Leander= home with his despatches\r\ncarried by Captain Berry. She fell in with the _Généreux_ on the 18th\r\nAugust, and was captured. On the 14th August Sir James Saumarez sailed\r\nwith the =Orion=, =Bellerophon=, =Minotaur=, =Defence=, =Audacious=,\r\n=Theseus=, and =Majestic=, to escort the French prizes the _Franklin_,\r\n_Tonnant_, _Aquilon_, _Conquérant_, and _Peuple Souverain_. Three of\r\nthe prizes were destroyed, and it would have been better that all\r\nshould have been burnt. But the just reward of the toils and dangers of\r\nofficers and men, and more especially of commanders-in-chief, junior\r\nadmirals, and captains, was not to be thrown away. So Saumarez made a\r\nslow, painful voyage westward with his convoy of battered hulks. He\r\nsummoned Malta, was defied by the French general, and gave arms to the\r\nislanders who had risen against the French, driven to desperation by\r\npillage and the violation of their women. Malta was blockaded by the\r\nPortuguese ships which had served with Jervis, and the =Lion=, 64. On\r\nthe 19th Nelson sailed with the =Vanguard=, =Culloden=, and =Alexander=\r\nfor Naples. He left the =Zealous=, =Goliath=, and =Swiftsure=, the\r\n=Seahorse=, =Emerald=, and =Alcmene= frigates, and the =Bonne Citoyene=\r\nsloop to watch the coast of Egypt. He himself, in an evil hour, sailed\r\nfor Naples. It is not superfluous to point out that though Nelson\r\nwas ardently desirous to weaken the French in Egypt he landed his\r\nprisoners, for whom he could with difficulty provide, and they afforded\r\nNapoleon a welcome reinforcement for his army. If the prizes had all\r\nbeen burnt after whatever stores were of use had been taken out of\r\nthem, if Nelson had sought a basis of operations in some Turkish port\r\nin Crete or Cyprus, the prisoners could have been kept in one of those\r\nislands and Egypt better watched.\r\n\r\nOur ships would at least have been better employed than many of them\r\nwere destined to be on the coast of Naples. The operations in which he\r\nwas engaged till he left the Mediterranean occupy a justly promoted\r\nplace in the biography of Nelson. They need few words here, and those\r\nfew only to show that they were a pure waste of force. The kingdom\r\nof Naples on the mainland was indefensible against a French army in\r\ncentral Italy by naval force. The Government was rotten and the troops\r\nwere worthless. The obvious deduction from these facts was that we\r\nought to have confined ourselves to blockading Malta, and ought to have\r\nwarned the king of Naples that he was not to expect any help from us if\r\nhe plunged into adventures. What happened was that Nelson, acting under\r\ninfluences which must be looked for in his biographies, egged on the\r\nking of Naples to make an attack on the French force occupying Rome,\r\nwhich brought on him an ignominious thrashing, and drove him to abject\r\nflight to Sicily in November and December of 1798. Henceforth a British\r\nsquadron reinforced to eight sail of the line and four Portuguese were\r\nemployed looking on idly at the occupation of Naples, till the advance\r\nof the Austrian and Russian armies in Northern Italy compelled the\r\nFrench to retreat. Then they rendered superfluous assistance to the\r\nNeapolitan Government to recover what could not be defended against\r\nit. While they were so employed their separation from other English\r\nforces in the Mediterranean helped to create a position of very serious\r\ndanger. Meanwhile, an English squadron, under Rear-Admiral Duckworth,\r\ncarrying troops under General Stuart, took possession of Minorca.\r\nThe Turks took up arms against the French, and Russia intervened.\r\nThe Ionian Isles, except Corfu, were regained from the French. The\r\nGovernment at Paris was driven to see that an effort must be made in\r\nthe Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston is credited with the shrewd saying that whenever a\r\nman is heard to say that “something must be done,” it is safe to\r\ncalculate on his doing something foolish. To strike out with no\r\ndefinite aim is rarely the way to deliver an effective stroke, though\r\nit may at times, and with help from fortune, be a more hopeful course\r\nthan lying still. Whether the French Government matured any coherent\r\nscheme during the last months of 1798 and the first of 1799 is highly\r\ndoubtful. We can only be sure as to what was actually done by them and\r\nfor them. It was in substance this, that their fleet at Brest was sent\r\ninto the Mediterranean, if not to do some definite thing, at least\r\nto see what could be done. The Minister of Marine, Eustache Bruix,\r\ncame down from Paris to take command himself. He was well supplied\r\nwith money, and it was in his power to pay the sailors and dockyard\r\nhands. Great and ardent exertions were made. The ships were better\r\nappointed and far better manned than any French fleet had been during\r\nthe war. The admiral was popular with the men, and he had cause to look\r\nwith confidence on the force which he had equipped by the middle of\r\nApril. It consisted of the following ships of the line. The _Ocean_,\r\n_Invincible_, _Républicain_, _Terrible_ of 110 guns; the _Formidable_\r\nand _Indomptable_ of 84; the _Jemmapes_, _Montblanc_, _Tyrannicide_,\r\n_Batave_, _Constitution_, _Révolution_, _Fongueux_, _Censeur_, _Zélé_,\r\n_Redoutable_, _Wattignies_, _Tourville_, _Cisalpin_, _Jean Bart_,\r\n_Gaulois_, _Convention_, _Duquesne_, _J. J. Rousseau_, _Dix Août_ of\r\n74, together with ten frigates, sloops, and ships armed _en flûte_ as\r\nstore ships.\r\n\r\nBridport had joined the small squadron which was watching Brest in\r\nApril, and had with him sixteen sail of the line. He had looked into\r\nthe Iroise, and knew that the French were preparing for sea, but\r\naccording to his usual practice he cruised at some distance to the\r\nW.S.W. of Ushant. On the very day on which he took up his position—the\r\n25th April—Bruix sailed through the Raz du Sein. He was sighted by the\r\n=Nymphe= frigate, Captain Fraser, who at once reported to Bridport.\r\nThe English admiral, punctual as ever in his own fashion, looked into\r\nBrest once more on the 26th, and then went off to Cape Clear. He was\r\nconvinced that the enemy were bound for Ireland, and they confirmed his\r\nbelief by putting a small vessel carrying an officer entrusted with a\r\nmisleading dispatch in his way, an old but well-preserved stratagem.\r\nBridport sent warnings to Cadiz and to England, and Bruix was left at\r\nliberty to go south.\r\n\r\nThe situation in front of him was nearly all he could wish. There was\r\nindeed no French force he could join. The _Généreux_ was at Corfu, and\r\nthe _Guillaume Tell_ at Malta. Nine vessels taken from the Venetians\r\nwere scattered between Alexandria, Ancona, and Toulon, but they were of\r\nno value. On the other hand, the Spaniards had a squadron of uncertain\r\nnumber and certain inefficiency at Cadiz, which had to be watched by\r\nthe English, and was therefore of indirect help to Bruix. Nothing need\r\nbe said of the Russians and Turks, save that they were moving in the\r\nMediterranean. Bruix’ real opponents were the English, and they were\r\nscattered. Fifteen sail of the line under Lord Keith were blockading\r\nCadiz. One was at Tetuan. Four were with Duckworth at Minorca. Nelson\r\nhad eight English sail of the line and four Portuguese, divided between\r\nthe blockade of Malta, the harbour of Palermo, where he himself lay\r\nat the urgent prayer of King Ferdinand to calm the nerves of the old\r\nwomen of both sexes in the runaway Neapolitan Court, and the coast of\r\nSouthern Italy, where the Royalists were gaining ground against the\r\nRepublic set up by the French. As the French troops had been called off\r\nto meet the allies in Northern Italy, the Republic was collapsing from\r\ninternal weakness. Minorca was of real value as a basis for a strong\r\nfleet blockading Toulon. As an isolated post hastily occupied by a\r\nhandful of soldiers, it was a mere burden. The whole disposition of our\r\nforces was as unintelligent and as vicious as it well could have been.\r\nOur naval forces in the Levant engaged in watching the coasts of Egypt\r\nand Syria may be left aside as not being immediately affected, and as\r\nbeing too far off to render prompt help.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd May, Keith was told by the =Success= frigate that she had\r\nsighted the French off Oporto coming south. With a big fleet coming\r\nagainst him from the Ocean, and nineteen, or so, Spaniards more or less\r\nready for sea in Cadiz, his position looked hazardous. He had need for\r\nsteady nerve, but the admiral though not a brilliant nor quick-witted\r\nman possessed that solid virtue in a useful degree. He waited, ready\r\nfor fight or retreat, till he saw what was going to happen. On the 4th,\r\nin the morning, the French were sighted, thirty-three sail of them, in\r\nthe W.N.W. The wind was blowing hard from the west, rising to a storm,\r\nand it drove curtains of confusing sea fog before it. As it blew right\r\ninto Cadiz Bay, the Spaniards could not move. Keith kept between them\r\nand the French. His expert ships maintained their formation and lost\r\nno spars in the stormy weather, which threw the French into confusion\r\nand caused them much minor damage. The fleets lost sight of one another\r\nin the fog, and on the 5th Bruix ran through the Straits before the\r\ngale. Two or three of his liners had suffered damage by collision and\r\nloss of spars, but he might have sent all three into Carthagena and\r\nstill have had twenty-two for a bold stroke. It was not till the 12th\r\nthat Nelson at Palermo heard of the inroad of the Brest fleet into the\r\nMediterranean. If Bruix had employed those seven days in steering for\r\nSouthern Italy, he had ninety-nine chances out of a hundred to souse\r\ndown on the vessels blockading Malta before they knew of his approach,\r\nto capture them, to cut off Nelson at Palermo, leaving him to rage\r\nsingle-handed with the =Vanguard= among the old women of both sexes\r\nof the Neapolitan Court, to fall on the ships on the coast of Naples,\r\ncapturing, driving ashore, or driving off every one of them. Then he\r\nmight have gone on to the Riviera and Toulon by the east of Sardinia\r\nand Corsica, after doing his cause a substantial service. He knew the\r\ndivided state of the English forces. He had laid some such plan as\r\nthis. But like his brother French admirals in this war, he was chilled\r\nby the first check. The damage suffered by his ships on the 4th and\r\n5th froze his ardour, and he steered piteously for Toulon, where he\r\nanchored on the 14th May with his two crippled ships, the _Batàve_ and\r\nthe _Fougueux_. And now for two months these numerous fleets, French\r\nand English, were engaged in missing one another in a game of blind\r\nman’s buff.\r\n\r\nSt. Vincent saw the French pass the Straits on the 5th, and at once\r\nsummoned the =Edgar= from Tetuan, and Keith from his cruising ground\r\nbetween Cadiz and Cape Spartel. On the 12th he followed Bruix—or\r\nrather, he steered for Minorca to join Duckworth, who was in danger\r\nof being cut off, and to cover the island, which in the absence of\r\na covering naval force might have been retaken by the Spaniards. He\r\njoined Duckworth on the 20th, and had twenty sail of the line on hand.\r\nOn that day Nelson had concentrated his ships at Maritimo. On that day,\r\ntoo, the Spaniards, who on finding the blockade of Cadiz raised by\r\nthe withdrawal of Keith, had come to sea hoping to be able to retake\r\nMinorca, staggered into Carthagena half dismasted by the gale. On\r\nthe 22nd, St. Vincent left Minorca for Toulon, but hearing that the\r\nSpaniards were coming round, put himself on their road to Toulon at\r\nCape San Sebastian on the 26th. On that day Bruix left Toulon for the\r\nRiviera with twenty-two sail to co-operate with the French armies now\r\nfighting in retreat before the allies. On the 30th May, St. Vincent\r\nwas joined by Rear-Admiral Whitshed with five sail of the line sent\r\nout from home to reinforce him. On the same day he sent Duckworth\r\nwith four ships to join Nelson. He now moved up the coast towards\r\nToulon, but on the 2nd June he found his health unequal to the strain\r\nof service at sea, and left the fleet for Minorca in his flagship the\r\n=Ville de Paris=, 100—for he would not go, so he said, in a frigate\r\n“like a convict,” and his regard for his dignity was strong enough to\r\nmake him weaken his successor by the loss of a very powerful ship.\r\nKeith, to whom the command now fell, went towards Toulon, while Bruix\r\nafter convoying a fleet of transports with provisions to the French\r\ngarrison of Genoa, went to Vado, and anchored there on the 4th. His\r\nmovement to the east was revealed to Keith by the crew of a prize, and\r\nhe went in pursuit on the 5th. When off Cape Delle Melle, he received\r\norders from St. Vincent to detach two more ships to Nelson, and to\r\ncruise off Rosas to intercept Bruix, who was, rightly enough, supposed\r\nto be bound for Carthagena. If the commander-in-chief had abstained\r\nfrom meddling, Keith would probably have met Bruix with twenty ships\r\nagainst the Frenchman’s twenty-two. On the 8th June, Bruix left Vado\r\nfor Carthagena, which was what St. Vincent calculated he would do. If\r\nhe were bound in that direction, what need was there to reinforce the\r\ndistant squadron of Nelson at the expense of the immediately threatened\r\nfleet of Keith, which was reduced by the detachment to eighteen sail\r\nof the line? If to divide your forces in the presence of an enemy\r\nis a blunder, and what Napoleon when criticising Cornwallis called\r\nan “_insigne bêtise_” then St. Vincent committed that blunder, that\r\n_insigne bêtise_. If Keith had obeyed his orders precisely, he would\r\nin all probability have met Bruix with eighteen ships to twenty-two.\r\nBut Keith was aware of his inferiority in numbers, and he came to\r\nMinorca to pick up the =Ville de Paris=. The Frenchman slipped through\r\nthe gap he left, and reached Carthagena on the 22nd June. While he was\r\ngoing on his way, and the _Batàve_ and _Fougueux_, repaired at Toulon,\r\nfollowed and joined him, Keith first picked up the =Ville de Paris= on\r\nthe 15th June, and went back to watch Toulon. On the 19th he secured\r\nmore reward for toils and dangers by capturing a small French squadron\r\nof three frigates and two brigs under Rear-Admiral Perrée, who had\r\nescaped from Syria and was on his way home. He cruised off Toulon from\r\nthe 20th to the 23rd, while Bruix was anchoring at Carthagena, while\r\nNelson was still watching for him, and while the Royalist forces were\r\ncompleting the ruin of the Republicans at Naples. On the 24th he went\r\nto Vado, just as Nelson, relieved from anxiety about Bruix, came into\r\nthe Bay of Naples in time to secure his dear King and Queen of Naples\r\na fine feast of hangings and torturings to console them for their\r\nspasms of terror during the last few months. The Republicans had been\r\nbeaten without need of our help, but if Nelson had not been at hand to\r\nsee that due vengeance was taken on Jacobins, they would have saved\r\ntheir lives by capitulation. On the 25th, Bruix sailed from Carthagena\r\nwith the refitted Spanish ships. Next day Keith went to Vado, and\r\nfrom thence to the east end of Minorca. On the 27th June he wrote to\r\nNelson asking him to send such ships as he could spare to assist in\r\ndefending Minorca, and Nelson refused on the ground that the safety of\r\nHis Sicilian Majesty’s dominions must be secured. Bruix, the only enemy\r\nwho could have assailed either, was then on his way from Carthagena to\r\nCadiz, which he reached on the 11th July. On the 8th, Keith had been\r\njoined near Minorca by Sir Charles Cotton, who brought twelve sail of\r\nthe line from home. On the 10th he left in pursuit of the French, of\r\nwhose presence at Carthagena he had been informed. On the 21st July,\r\nBruix sailed from Cadiz, dragging with him a reluctant Spanish squadron\r\nwhich was forced to accompany him by its intimidated Government. When\r\nKeith sailed from Gibraltar on the 30th July the Frenchman had a long\r\nstart, and it was lucky for him that he had. The French sailed ill,\r\nand the Spaniards still more badly, so that when Bruix and his Spanish\r\ncolleague, Mazaredo, anchored in the roadstead of Brest they were just\r\nahead of Keith, who sailed a greater distance and started nine days\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the famous cruise of Bruix—one of the passages of the great\r\nRevolutionary war which best deserves study. The French gained a\r\nmaterial advantage, for they carried off a Spanish squadron, and so\r\nsecured a hostage for the obedience of the Spanish Government and\r\npeople, who were becoming restive under the disasters brought on them\r\nby the Alliance. But what is to be said of the English officers who\r\nallowed them to gain this advantage, such as it was? Bridport, who was\r\nnegligent, and was befooled, is defended by nobody. Can anything be\r\nsaid for St. Vincent? for Nelson? even for Keith, the least responsible\r\nof the three? St. Vincent made it inevitable that he would be weak in\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar when he allowed so large a proportion of his\r\nfleet to be detached to Naples. Nelson intensified the bad consequences\r\nof the initial mistake when he egged the Neapolitan Government on to\r\nmake its silly attack on the French, thereby bringing down a torrent of\r\ndisasters. Two English liners and the Portuguese could have blockaded\r\nMalta in the then prostrate state of the French. If six of the eight\r\nships of the line with Nelson had been in the Straits on the 5th May,\r\nthey with the sixteen already there would have been in a position to\r\ngive battle to Bruix at once, and thereby to give the best possible\r\nprotection both to Minorca and to Naples. When the French did appear,\r\nSt. Vincent divided his fleet by sending Duckworth to Naples, and then\r\nweakened Keith by forcing him to detach two other vessels. And that he\r\ndid just when he was doing all that lay in his power to bring about\r\na battle with forces which he knew to be superior. The conduct of\r\nNelson can be explained, but is a commander to be held excused when we\r\nsay that he was but a fallible man, liable to be besotted by erotic\r\ndelusion and megalomania? We suffered no disaster. We only failed, and\r\nfor that escape from the natural consequences of our acts we have to\r\nthank the Providence which had served us already by blowing Hoche and\r\nMorard de Galle away from the coast of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe escape of Bruix was followed within a month and a few days by the\r\nescape of Napoleon from Egypt. As war, according to his own maxim, is\r\nan affair not of men but of a man, this was a disaster of the first\r\nmagnitude for the enemies of France. Hood, who had been left to watch\r\nthe coast of Egypt in August, was superseded on the 2nd of February\r\n1799 by Troubridge with the =Culloden= and =Theseus=. A month later—on\r\nthe 3rd March—Troubridge was in turn superseded by Sir Sidney Smith,\r\nwho brought with him the =Tigre=, 74, and some small craft. By a\r\npiece of most eccentric management, Smith had been appointed Envoy\r\nPlenipotentiary to the Porte in combination with his brother, Spencer\r\nSmith, who already held the post. Being what our ancestors called a\r\n“bold undertaking fellow” and we call a “very pushing man,” Smith gave\r\nhimself the airs of a commander-in-chief, to the extreme exasperation\r\nof Nelson, who snubbed him with emphasis. All these officers\r\nsuccessively, or in combination, contrived almost, but not quite, to\r\ncut off Napoleon from communication with France. They bombarded the\r\nships in Alexandria repeatedly with no great effect. From March to\r\nthe 21st of June, Smith was busily engaged in helping the Pasha of\r\nAcre, Djezzar (the Butcher), to repel the attack of Napoleon, who had\r\nmarched out of Egypt to follow on the footsteps of Alexander the Great.\r\nAfter his return to Egypt, Smith helped a Turkish army to land at\r\nAboukir—an adventure comparable with the Neapolitan advance on Rome,\r\nand similar in its results. The Turks were cut to pieces on the 25th\r\nJuly. Napoleon, who was informed of the renewal of the war on land in\r\nEurope, was preparing to escape before the Turks landed at Aboukir. As\r\nthe vital work of confining him to Egypt had been subordinated to the\r\nsecurity of His Sicilian Majesty’s dominions, the blockading squadron\r\nwas small. The two liners, the =Tigre= and =Theseus=, Sidney Smith had\r\nwith him, were taken by him to Cyprus for stores on the 9th August.\r\nOn the 23rd Napoleon sailed from Alexandria, the coast being clear,\r\nand got away. On the 1st October he touched at Ajaccio, and on the 9th\r\nhe landed at Fréjus. His return marks an epoch in the history of the\r\nwar, of Europe, and of mankind. It was followed by the overthrow of\r\nthe Directory and his assumption of despotic power as First Consul.\r\nFrom that day all the power of France was directed by his great and\r\nmaleficent genius. He might have escaped in any case, but he was helped\r\nto escape by the British Government and its admirals. They were loud in\r\nproclaiming the necessity of imprisoning him in Egypt, but they kept an\r\ninsufficient force to blockade him, because they preferred to employ\r\ntheir ships to peddle in the Bay of Naples, or to patrol round the\r\nisland of Minorca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nINVASION TILL THE CLOSE OF 1801\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES.—As before.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe retreat of Bruix from the Mediterranean and the return of Napoleon\r\nwere followed by a pause in the naval war. The French fleet was\r\nexhausted by the effort it had made, and its return to Brest was\r\nfollowed by an outbreak of discontent, mutiny, and desertion among\r\nthe crews. The Spaniards they had brought with them, sixteen sail,\r\nwere politically useful to France as hostages, but were of no military\r\nvalue. The Spanish Ferrol squadron, which was to have joined Bruix\r\nwhen on his way to the Mediterranean in April, had missed him, perhaps\r\ndeliberately, had then gone on to Aix roads, where they were attacked\r\nto no purpose by the frigates and bomb-vessels of an English squadron\r\ncommanded by Rear-Admiral Pole on the 2nd July. They returned home in\r\nthe course of September, after an attempt to enter Brest. While the\r\nFrench naval forces were thus exhausted, Napoleon was absorbed in the\r\ndischarge of obligations which were preliminary to the renewal of an\r\nattack on England. He had first to make himself master of France by\r\nthe _coup d’état_ of the 18th Brumaire VIII (9th November 1799). Then\r\nhe had to beat the Austrians who were pressing on the south-eastern\r\nfrontier of France, and to bring about a separation between them and\r\nthe Russians, with whom they were on very bad terms. In the interval\r\nthe French could do nothing to help the army Napoleon had left behind\r\nhim in Egypt, except endeavour to send blockade runners with news and\r\nstores. It became continually more difficult for them to do even this.\r\nThey were excluded from Italy, and Corfu had surrendered on the 3rd\r\nMarch 1799 to the Turks and Russians.\r\n\r\nWhen Keith left the Mediterranean in pursuit of Bruix, Nelson remained\r\nin temporary command, but in the absence of an enemy he had nothing to\r\ndo save to tighten the blockade of Malta and keep an eye on Minorca,\r\nwhich continued to be a burden and a cause of division of forces.\r\nHe did not cease to be absorbed in schemes for the promotion of the\r\ninterests of Their Sicilian Majesties—schemes which were superfluous\r\nif the French were beaten in Northern Italy, and were certain to\r\nbe blown into space so soon as they were victorious. The English\r\nGovernment being well aware by this time that Nelson had “Sicilified”\r\nhis conscience, decided to send Lord Keith back to his post as\r\nCommander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean. It was his due, for he had\r\nbeen sent out to be second in command to St. Vincent, and the duty had\r\nbeen handed over to him by his chief. Keith was not a genius, but he\r\nhad common sense, he had not forgotten that he was the servant of King\r\nGeorge III., and he was impervious to the fascinations of the court of\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\nKeith sailed on the 20th November 1799 to resume the command, and\r\nreached Gibraltar on the 6th December. In the absence of a French fleet\r\nhe had no duty to discharge except to superintend the blockade of Malta\r\nand help our Austrian allies as far as he could. Malta had long been\r\ncut off from communication with home. An attempt was made to relieve\r\nthe garrison on the 18th February. A small convoy was sent under the\r\nprotection of the _Généreux_, which had escaped from Corfu. The convoy\r\nwas commanded by the Rear-Admiral, Perrée, who had been taken by Lord\r\nKeith in the previous year. The convoy was scattered, Perrée was\r\nkilled, and the _Généreux_ was taken by a number of vessels immediately\r\ncommanded by Nelson in his flagship the =Foudroyant=. On the 30th\r\nFebruary the _Guillaume Tell_, the last survivor of the French fleet of\r\nthe battle of the Nile, which was lying in Malta, made an attempt to\r\nescape. She was sighted, pursued, surrounded by a swarm of enemies, and\r\nwas surrendered, after a most magnificent defence, by Admiral Decrès,\r\nwho held the superior command in her, and who was to be Napoleon’s\r\nMinister of Marine. The fate of the garrison was now certain, but\r\nGeneral Vaubois held out till English troops had been landed to\r\nreinforce the islanders, and till hunger compelled him to surrender on\r\nthe 5th September 1800.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Malta was timely, for it coincided with the collapse\r\nof the allies in Italy, and made us independent of ports on the\r\nmainland. In spring the Austrians seemed to be making themselves\r\nmasters of Northern Italy, and the English Government appeared to\r\nbe about to support them with decision. Troops were sent to Minorca\r\nunder command of General Fox. Others followed, and were ordered to\r\nfollow, under the commandership-in-chief of Sir Ralph Abercromby, an\r\nold officer who at least knew his business in the field, and had done\r\npromising service in the West Indies and the Low Countries. But Austria\r\nand England were preparing victory for France under a vain show of\r\nenergy. The Austrians had got rid of their Russian ally, the great\r\nSuvarof, a real captain, whose habit of concentrating his men, striking\r\nat the heart of his enemy, and wringing the last drop of gain out of\r\nevery success, shocked their pedantry. Moreover, it was their intention\r\nto deliver Italy from French oppression and revolutionary principles\r\nfor the purpose of putting it into their own pockets. Therefore they\r\nhad no wish for the help of an associate who would cry halves. They\r\nwere going to work by the book of arithmetic, sagaciously besieging\r\nand taking post after post, and thereby they allowed Napoleon ample\r\ntime to organise the army which was to wrench all their conquests from\r\nthem in one day of battle. The English Government was disposed to help\r\nby sending soldiers to fight a little and then come away. Sir Charles\r\nPasley, author of a treatise on _The Military Policy of the British\r\nEmpire_, which appeared in 1808 and produced a great impression, said\r\nepigrammatically that we worked with our navy and played with our army.\r\nThe operations before 1800, and on too many occasions afterwards, till\r\nSpain gave us a safe footing in 1808, justify his scoff. It was too\r\nmuch the custom of the English Government to overcrowd soldiers into\r\nleaky transports where they were plagued by scurvy, and to keep them\r\nhanging round the outskirts of the European conflict. Like an immortal\r\npersonage in a great English classic, our army was always making the\r\ngesture of taking its coat off. When it was allowed to land, the\r\ngenerals were carefully instructed to go no farther than they could go\r\nback easily. They were to advance with their eyes over their shoulders.\r\nIn the autumn of 1799 we had made an inroad of this half-hearted kind\r\ninto Holland in co-operation with the Russians. It was badly led, for\r\nthe Duke of York, an excellent commander-in-chief at the Horse Guards\r\nbut a deplorable general in the field, was the leader. But the forces\r\nemployed were insufficient. We gained a naval advantage. The remains\r\nof the Dutch fleet fell into our hands at the Nieuwe Diep, partly\r\nthrough the bad management of their admiral, Storij, but mainly because\r\nthe Dutch sailors would not fight. They had an hereditary loyalty to\r\nthe house of Orange, and they were discontented with a life of unpaid\r\nidleness under the Batavian Republic. And here it is not irrelevant\r\nto record that the Dutch sailors were already swarming into our navy\r\nand merchant ships. It was calculated that in 1800 as many as 20,000\r\nDutchmen were sailing under our flag. As the predominance of France\r\ngrew more and more oppressive, as she dragged one country after another\r\ninto her struggle with England, ever increasing numbers of foreign\r\nsailors sought a refuge from ruin at home in our ports. They were\r\ninvited by the English law, which gave naturalisation and with it the\r\nright to command a merchant ship to any foreigner who had served for\r\ntwo years in our navy. Northern seamen were preferred, both because\r\nthey were hardier men, and because coming from kindred races Jansen\r\neasily became Johnson, and Pieterzoon Peterson. Therefore it was that\r\nwe were able to man both our navy and our merchant service, which\r\ndoubled during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.\r\n\r\nOur share in the resistance to France in Northern Italy during the\r\ncommand of Lord Keith was quite on the then prevailing model. It was\r\nefficient in so far as it was naval, and in so far as it was military\r\nit was pitiful. Abercromby came to Minorca in May, and we made the\r\ngesture of taking off our coat to help the Austrians at the siege of\r\nGenoa, where Massena was tenaciously holding out with the last French\r\narmy in Italy. But the coat was not taken off. The navy blockaded\r\nvigilantly, helped to capture small French posts, and did some gallant\r\ncutting out. The cutting out of the _Prima_ galley from the mole of\r\nGenoa by Captain Beaver was as dashing a piece of work of that kind as\r\nwas done in the war. The galley slaves, of whom some were criminals,\r\nbut some were prisoners of war, rowed the galley out with alacrity when\r\nBeaver had loosened the chains which bound her to the mole. The story\r\nhad a sickening sequel. It seems incredible that Keith, a man of honour\r\nand humanity, should have sent the greater part of these poor wretches\r\nback to Genoa, where they were butchered by Massena. But “such things\r\nwere,” to use a favourite phrase of Nelson’s. The incident was typical,\r\nfor at that time we were much in the habit of landing against the\r\nFrench, inviting the help of the people, and then leaving them in the\r\nlurch. “Such things” went far to put a meaning into Napoleon’s abuse of\r\nPerfidious Albion, which used all men for her own advantage, and left\r\nthem to suffer for trusting to her word.\r\n\r\nMassena was starved out by the 4th June, and next day the town was\r\noccupied by the allies—Austrian soldiers and English ships. English\r\nsoldiers were going to come from Minorca, but did not. It was perhaps\r\nfortunate they did not, for nine days after our vessels anchored\r\nat the mole, Napoleon’s army smashed the Austrians at Marengo. A\r\nbeating usually extorted an armistice and large surrenders from\r\nAustria. So it did now. An armistice was signed at Alessandria two\r\ndays after the defeat. The Austrians surrendered their conquests in\r\nPiedmont wholesale, and on the 23rd Massena reoccupied Genoa with such\r\npromptitude that the =Minotaur= was hardly able to warp out of the port\r\nin time to escape capture.\r\n\r\nPolitical necessities made it incumbent on Napoleon to return to Paris,\r\nand the full harvest of Marengo was not gathered till the close of\r\n1800. But a great wind of terror began to blow all along the Italian\r\nPeninsula. The Queen of Naples went off to implore the Czar Paul to\r\nsave her dominions. Nelson went with her, and the English Minister at\r\nNaples, Sir William Hamilton, who had been superseded after many and\r\nflagrant proofs of dotage. Naples may be dismissed for the present\r\nwith a brief notice that the king continued to attempt to play a part,\r\nand gain an increase of territory in Central Italy—at least to enrich\r\nhis collections of pictures and statues by the plunder of Rome. He\r\nhad an army, and it was handsomely tailored. But as King Ferdinand’s\r\ncynical son and successor remarked when he was asked to approve of a\r\nnew uniform for his army, “You may dress them as you please, they will\r\nalways run away.” When war was resumed in the autumn, the Neapolitan\r\narmy bolted at the mere sight of a small French force, the cavalry\r\nriding in panic over the panic-stricken foot at a slashing pace—and\r\nKing Ferdinand went down on all fours. It was a relief to be rid of\r\nNaples, but the occupation of Malta in September had been timely.\r\n\r\nAfter the return of Napoleon to Paris, there took place one of those\r\ndelusive negotiations in which he not uncommonly sought a military\r\nadvantage. He tried to turn the armistice with Austria into a naval\r\narmistice with England. But as usual with him, the terms he offered\r\nwere excessively favourable to himself. He wished to retain the right\r\nto send six frigates armed _en flûte_ to Malta and Egypt, and to obtain\r\nsecurity that they would not be examined or stopped. His intention\r\nwas to fill them with soldiers and stores to reinforce the garrison\r\nand the army of occupation. The English Government would have been\r\nguilty of incredible folly if it had accepted such a proposal. It\r\nrefused, and Napoleon resumed hostilities in October. On sea there had\r\nbeen no suspension. We had taken Malta, and had defended Elba, and we\r\nwere at last preparing to intervene with vigour in Egypt. It was a\r\nconsideration of the first importance that the French should not be in\r\nactual possession of the country when serious negotiations for peace\r\nwere begun.\r\n\r\nEgypt would have been evacuated in January 1800 but for want of good\r\nmanagement on our part. On the 24th of that month Kléber signed a\r\nconvention with the Grand Vizier by which he undertook to evacuate\r\nthe country if his army was allowed to return home. Sidney Smith, who\r\ncommanded on the coast, did not sign the convention, but he agreed to\r\nallow the Frenchmen to pass. When, however, he referred to Keith, who\r\nhad just returned from England, the admiral who had general orders not\r\nto allow the French to go except as prisoners, refused his consent. His\r\nrefusal was notified to Kléber, who considered himself cheated, and\r\ntook his revenge not on us, whom he could not reach, but on the unhappy\r\nTurks, who were perfectly innocent of any breach of faith. He fell\r\nupon them, and defeated them with enormous slaughter at Heliopolis.\r\nWhen the English Government heard the facts, it gave its consent to the\r\nfree return of the French army. But it was now too late. Kléber had\r\nbeen murdered by a Mahometan fanatic. His successor, Menou, would not\r\nconfirm the convention, and nothing remained to be done but to send an\r\narmy and turn him out. It is customary to speak of the convention of El\r\nArish as a foolish business. Yet the Turks had a fair right to recover\r\ntheir province when they could, and some ground to complain of us for\r\nspoiling their chance. The British army would have lost one of the most\r\nhonourable passages in its history if the convention had been carried\r\nout. But politically we had everything to gain by the evacuation of the\r\ncountry. Kléber’s twenty thousand men were a chip in the porridge of\r\nthe half-million soldiers of France. Marengo and Hohenlinden were won\r\nwithout them. Napoleon’s position would have been notably weaker after\r\nMarengo if Egypt had been already lost. This was an advantage which was\r\nill replaced by the honour of the thing, and the feather in our cap.\r\nMoreover, we could not know that Kléber would be murdered, and that\r\nMenou would show military ineptitude.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1800 was rich in examples of the two ways of making war,\r\nthe right and the wrong. Napoleon left the command in the field to\r\nhis generals. On the 3rd December the defeat of the Archduke John by\r\nMoreau at Hohenlinden brought Austria to the ground. She made peace for\r\nherself, though bound by treaty and subsidies not to act apart from\r\nus. Brune and Murat completed the subjugation of Italy. Naples became\r\na mere appendage of France by the treaty of Foligno, and the treaty of\r\nLunéville, signed by France and Austria on the 9th February 1801, left\r\nEngland without an ally on the Continent. When he was rid of Austria\r\nand dominator of Italy, Napoleon was free to concentrate his attention\r\non the war with England. As England had no sufficient army with which\r\nto attack him at home, she was everywhere on the defensive—on the\r\nsuperior defensive, no doubt, but on the defensive—except where it\r\nwas possible to assail an isolated body of French troops—to wit in\r\nEgypt. Our utter inability to attack the bulk of Napoleon’s power was\r\nwell shown in June 1800. St. Vincent, who had hoisted his flag as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Channel fleet on the 26th April, detached Sir\r\nEdward Pellew with seven sail of the line on the 1st June to escort\r\n5000 troops under General Maitland. They were to seize Quiberon, and to\r\nrevive the Royalists of Brittany and La Vendée to activity. St. Vincent\r\nacted, of course, by orders of the Government, which was much inclined\r\nto such expeditions, and had hopes of success in an attack on Brest,\r\nwhich came to nothing. The expedition of Pellew and Maitland came to\r\nas good as nothing. A small fort was taken, a number of small vessels\r\nwere captured or destroyed, a brilliant piece of cutting-out work was\r\ndone by Jeremiah Coghlan, a favourite and follower of Pellew. But as\r\nthe west of France was occupied by a strong army under Bernadotte,\r\nGeneral Maitland could make no impression, and could only re-embark\r\nin haste. Pellew was eager to attack Belleisle, but as the island was\r\nheld by 7000 men and was powerfully fortified, a landing would have\r\nbeen a costly folly. General Maitland very rightly refused to lead his\r\nmen to destruction. They were landed on the island of Houat, where\r\nthey remained till they were picked up at the end of July by Sir J.\r\nB. Warren, who brought other troops with him under General Pulteney.\r\nThe whole force went south at the beginning of August to join Keith\r\nand Abercromby, and to make up an army which was to be employed in\r\nEgypt, the only field in which such a military force as we could then\r\nmuster could be used with effect. It was hoped that a stroke might\r\nbe delivered at the Spaniards on the way. The squadron of Admiral\r\nMalgarejo, which had returned from the coast of France in the previous\r\nSeptember, was at Ferrol, the great Spanish arsenal in Galicia. Ferrol,\r\nwhich lies on the north side of a land-locked harbour, is approached\r\nby a fortified channel a mile and a half long. The navy did not force\r\nthe passage. It landed Pulteney’s soldiers and a naval brigade under\r\nPellew on Doniños beach to the north of the passage between Gabeiras\r\nand Serantes or Golfin Points. Doniños is directly to the west of\r\nFerrol, and is separated from it by some miles of hilly country. The\r\nsoldiers drove back a small force of Spanish militia and advanced to\r\nheights from which they had a clear view of Ferrol. Pulteney had a\r\nwalled town before him, and he knew that it was occupied by a garrison.\r\nHe appears to have exaggerated the numbers of the Spaniards. But there\r\nwas a garrison, and there were walls. As the navy had not forced the\r\npassage, it could give him no help in attacking the town. He had no\r\nbattering-train, but only a few light field pieces which the sailors\r\nhad landed and dragged up for him. He came to the conclusion that time\r\nand men must be spent to take Ferrol—and he had neither to spare. He\r\ntherefore re-embarked, and it is hard to say that he was wrong. His\r\nfailure has been much derided, and it has been usual to say that the\r\nnavy did its part. But the navy did not do its part, which would have\r\nbeen to force an entrance to the harbour of Ferrol, and bring the water\r\nfront of the town under its guns. It asked the army to storm unbreached\r\nfortifications.\r\n\r\nAfter this futility, and another at Vigo, the combined expedition went\r\non to Gibraltar, and there joined Keith and Abercromby. Before it\r\nwent on its proper work, it made another such demonstration as that\r\nat Ferrol. On the 4th of October the whole force was brought round to\r\nCadiz. The customary version of the story is that the Spanish governor,\r\nMorla, appealed to the English commanders to spare the town, which was\r\nsuffering from a great epidemic of yellow fever, and that the gallant\r\nEnglishmen, ever generous to a suppliant foe, sailed away. This is\r\npoetry. The prose of the story is well told by Keith’s captain of the\r\nfleet, Philip Beaver. “Independent of the objection which a dreadful\r\nmalady, called by some the plague and by others the yellow fever,\r\nopposed to our disembarking, the late season of the year, the danger\r\nof the coast, and the difficulty of communication between the soldiers\r\nand sailors were deemed sufficient by the two commanders-in-chief to\r\nrelinquish the attempt.” Abercromby had orders not to land unless he\r\nwas sure of being able to embark immediately in case of need. The\r\nnaval officers would not promise to be able to re-embark his men at\r\nall times. Moreover, confusion had arisen when an attempt was made to\r\nget the soldiers into the boats, and they were suffering severely from\r\nscurvy after months of detention in wet and overcrowded transports, on\r\na diet of salt meat, and sleeping on dripping decks in their clothes\r\nand blankets. But now at least the time of fumbling and pottering\r\nwas over. On the 5th November, Keith and Abercromby sailed for Malta,\r\nleaving Warren with six sail of the line to watch the Straits. They\r\ncollected their command at Malta, and on the 20th December they sailed\r\nto the Levant with resources sanely adapted to an attainable end.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was well aware of the value of Egypt as an asset when the\r\ntime came for making peace. He strove hard to relieve the army of\r\noccupation. He drew up elaborate schemes for reinforcing it by\r\nsquadrons of French and Spanish which were to combine by complicated\r\nmovements. What was more to the purpose was that he sent out frigate\r\nafter frigate crowded with men and stores from Toulon and the western\r\nports. When he heard of the concentration of Abercromby’s force at\r\nMalta, he redoubled his efforts. Some of the vessels he sent reached\r\ntheir destination. The _Egyptienne_ and _Justice_ frigates anchored at\r\nAlexandria on the 3rd February 1801—four days after Abercromby, who\r\nsailed from Malta on the 20th December 1800, had anchored in Marmorice\r\nBay, in Caramania, on the 31st January. The fleet of seven sail of the\r\nline, frigates, and from 60 to 70 transports turned with relief from a\r\nstormy sea to the land-locked harbour. Keith owed his knowledge of its\r\nexistence to Sidney Smith, so ill was the Levant known at the time. As\r\nthe leading vessel turned into the entrance between towering headlands\r\nshe seemed to the ships behind to be steered against a precipice. Here\r\nthe fleet lay recruiting the health of the soldiers, practising them\r\nin landing, collecting stores, listening to the fluent and unfulfilled\r\npromises of the Turk, till the 22nd February, when it sailed for Egypt.\r\nIt sighted the coast on the 1st March. On that day the last relief from\r\nFrance reached Egypt. The _Régénérée_ frigate and _Lodi_ brig ran into\r\nAlexandria parallel with Keith’s convoy. The _Régénérée_ had sailed\r\non the 13th February with the _Africaine_ from Rochefort. The history\r\nof the _Africaine_ shows at what a cost this work of reinforcing an\r\nisolated force oversea in face of a superior enemy had to be done.\r\nShe separated from the _Régénérée_, and on the 18th February, being\r\nthen near Ceuta, was sighted, chased, and overtaken by the =Phœbe=,\r\nCaptain Barlow. The _Africaine_ had in her 400 soldiers and officials\r\nin addition to her crew of 350. Her captain, Saulnier, who had\r\ncommanded the _Guillaume Tell_ under Decrès, made a gallant attempt to\r\nresist capture, and fell in the action. She could make no effectual\r\nresistance, and when Saulnier’s successor, Magendie, struck his flag,\r\nthere were 343 dead and wounded out of 715 men packed into her. The\r\nloss of the =Phœbe= was—1 man killed, 2 officers and 10 men wounded.\r\n\r\nThe history of the expedition to Egypt belongs to the army from the\r\n8th March when it was landed by three detachments and in beautiful\r\norder. The bad generalship of Menou aiding, our soldiers showed that\r\nthey could look the best soldiers of France (who yet fought valiantly)\r\nin the face, and in the back too. In June Sir Home Popham, coming from\r\nIndia, landed an Indian contingent at Kosseir on the Red Sea, which\r\ncrossed the desert to Cairo in June. The ships in the Mediterranean\r\nrendered help and stood on guard. Their last service was to drive off\r\nthe belated squadron of Honoré Ganteaume which arrived on the coast on\r\nthe 7th June.\r\n\r\nThe doings of that squadron touch our own naval history closely.\r\nGanteaume was ordered to sail from Brest with three 80-gun ships and\r\nfour 74’s. Five thousand soldiers and officials were crowded into\r\nhis vessels. It was given out that they were bound for San Domingo.\r\nThis was done to spread a false impression, and not without effect.\r\nGanteaume went through the Raz du Sein on the 8th January, but, finding\r\nhis way barred by an English squadron, came back. St. Vincent had now\r\nestablished his close blockade in the face of some sulky opposition\r\nfrom officers accustomed to the easier ways of Bridport. He applied his\r\nrule “always close up to Brest in the easterly winds.” It is therefore\r\na useful corrective to much we are told of the merits of that blockade,\r\nto note that while a heavy gale was blowing from the N.E. on the 23rd\r\nJanuary, Ganteaume made a dash through the Iroise and got away clear to\r\nthe south. When St. Vincent heard of the escape of the French squadron\r\nhe was deceived as to its destination. Our numerous and capable spies\r\nhad no doubt reported the rumour that San Domingo was the aim, and St.\r\nVincent sent seven ships of the line to the West Indies. Ganteaume\r\nbore on for the Mediterranean, much tried by the gale, and for a time\r\nseparated in his flagship, the _Indivisible_, from the rest of his\r\nsquadron. But he reunited them on the 1st February, and on the 9th he\r\nran through the Straits. On the 13th he captured the =Success=, and\r\nlearnt from her that Keith must by this time be close to Egypt. He\r\nconsidered his mission hopeless, and steered for Toulon, very full of\r\ncomplaints as to the damage done to his ships and other obstructions.\r\nWarren, who could not stop him in the Straits, hurried to Minorca to\r\nprotect that perpetual clog and nuisance to the fleet. At Minorca he\r\nheard that our late ally of Naples was being bullied into joining the\r\nFrench against us, and sailed to Sicily to protect our interests. He\r\nreduced his squadron, leaving one of his six liners to protect Minorca.\r\nSuch is the value of a basis of operations which the forces based upon\r\nit dare not leave to its own resources. Ganteaume reached Toulon on\r\nthe 18th February, two days before Warren reached Minorca, and on the\r\n19th March sailed again. On the 25th he sighted Warren coming back\r\nfrom Sicily by the east side of Sardinia, and turned back to Toulon.\r\nHe had seven sail to five, and a fine chance to win honour. But he had\r\nhis mission to fulfil, and though he believed it to be incapable of\r\nfulfilment, he was prepared to make it an excuse for avoiding action.\r\nWarren, having lost sight of him, went hunting for him to south and\r\neast. On the 5th April Ganteaume was back in Toulon. On the 25th he\r\nwas hounded out by Napoleon. He went down the coast of Italy, gave\r\nsome help to the French forces then endeavouring to drive out the\r\nAnglo-Tuscan garrison which held Elba, left the three slowest ships\r\nof his squadron at Leghorn, pushed, driven by the anger of the First\r\nConsul to unwonted daring, through the Straits of Messina, and actually\r\nsighted the coast of Egypt 210 miles west of Alexandria on the 7th\r\nJune. He detached the _Heliopolis_ brig to Alexandria, where the French\r\ntroops were still holding out, and waited for news. As none came as\r\nsoon as he expected, he concluded that the _Heliopolis_ was taken, and\r\nso went next to Bengasi in Tripoli intending to land troops there on a\r\nhopeful mission to march by the desert to Egypt. As a matter of fact\r\nthe _Heliopolis_ found the coast clear and got safely into Alexandria.\r\nKeith, who had warning by the =Pique= frigate that Ganteaume was not\r\nfar off, had gone in pursuit of him. The Frenchman was actually\r\nsighted, but cut his cables, and went off to Toulon. It is a tell-tale\r\ncomment on his incessant complaints of the state of his squadron that\r\nhe not only out-sailed Keith, but on the 24th sighted the =Swiftsure=,\r\nCaptain Keats, on his way from Egypt to Gibraltar near Cape Dernah,\r\novertook her, captured her, and carried her with him to Toulon, where\r\nhe dropped anchor on the 22nd July. The French ships were indifferently\r\nfitted, the crews unpaid for a year, ill-rationed, and in rags. Yet\r\nhere we see one of their squadrons, timidly commanded, elude the\r\nvaunted St. Vincent blockade, pass an English squadron unhindered in\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar, range the whole length of the Mediterranean,\r\nand end without disaster after capturing a line-of-battle ship and a\r\nfrigate, to say nothing of small craft destroyed. How would it have\r\nbeen if the equipment had been better, and the chief had been Suffren\r\nor Duguay Trouin?\r\n\r\nThe frigates and the cruise of Ganteaume’s squadron, were not the only\r\nnor the most formidable efforts Napoleon made to preserve his hold on\r\nEgypt. The formation of the Northern Coalition was in fact a part of\r\nhis policy, which aimed at securing her conquests for France. In theory\r\nthe coalition was an alliance signed on the 15th December 1800, by\r\nRussia, Prussia, Denmark, and Sweden, to restrict England’s exercise of\r\nher belligerent rights at sea. The immediate pretext was the capture\r\nof the Danish frigate _Freya_, whose captain refused to allow merchant\r\nships under his protection to be searched, on the 25th July 1800. There\r\nwas much hypocrisy in the outcry over the alleged wrongs of neutrals.\r\nNo doubt they were annoyed, and to some extent injured, by England’s\r\nassertion of her claim to capture her enemy’s goods in their ships.\r\nBut Sweden, in a recent war with Russia, had gone as far as England in\r\nthe exercise of belligerent rights. Russia had urged England to go to\r\nall lengths against the shipping of revolutionary France, and Denmark\r\nhad profited largely by her position as a neutral. The real author\r\nof the coalition was Napoleon, who worked on the admiration felt for\r\nhim by the erratic (perhaps the mad) Czar, Paul. Paul put pressure on\r\nthe northern powers, who dared not offend him. He was annoyed by the\r\noccupation of Malta by England, for he had taken the island under his\r\nown protection. As the coalition depended on him it was weak, for Paul\r\nhad made himself an object of hate and fear to all about him. His war\r\nwith England inflicted heavy loss on the wealthier classes in Russia.\r\nA plot, of which the English Government was certainly not entirely\r\nignorant, was being laid against him. The English Government could not,\r\nhowever, afford to wait till the Russians had rid themselves of their\r\nmischievous ruler by the use of the so-called “Asiatic Remedy,” which\r\nwas in vulgar English, murder.\r\n\r\nTherefore on the 12th March, Sir Hyde Parker, who had with him Nelson\r\nas second in command, sailed from Yarmouth with fifteen sail of the\r\nline, afterwards raised to eighteen. His mission was to coerce Denmark\r\nand Sweden into leaving the coalition, if they could not be persuaded\r\nto retire by Mr. Vansittart, afterwards Lord Bexley, who was sent to\r\nCopenhagen on a diplomatic mission. The naval forces of the allies may\r\nhave amounted to forty-one sail of the line, but the Russians, who had\r\nthe most numerous fleet, were still shut up in the ice in Revel.\r\n\r\nThe English fleet was off the Naze of Norway by the 18th March. On the\r\n23rd Mr. Vansittart, who had gone to Copenhagen, returned with the\r\nnews that the Danes would not surrender. On the 30th the fleet passed\r\nthe Sound, giving the Danish coast a wide berth, and not encountering\r\nany opposition from the forts on the Swedish side. It anchored at\r\nHveen, an island in the Sound, about fifteen miles above Copenhagen.\r\nParker, Nelson, Rear-Admiral Graves, Domett the captain of the Fleet,\r\nand Stewart, who commanded a contingent of soldiers carried by the\r\nwarships, reconnoitred the enemy’s position on the same day in the\r\nlugger =Lark=. They soon saw that the Danes had not been negligent in\r\npreparing to resist attack. The position to be assailed was a strong\r\none by nature. Copenhagen stands at the east end of the island of\r\nZeeland, on both sides of a narrow inlet running from N.E. to S.W. The\r\nentrance to this inlet was (and is) covered by the Trekroner forts,\r\nthen mounting 68 guns. From the south side of the inlet the coast\r\nruns to the south. The Danes had drawn up their floating defences,\r\nline-of-battle ships without masts, frames and other vessels to the\r\nnumber of thirty-seven, carrying 628 guns, along this bit of coast.\r\nThey were supported by batteries on shore, but as the sea is shallow\r\nnear the land the support was not very close. In front of the line was\r\nthe water of the King’s Deep (Konge-dyb) and beyond that the shoal\r\ncalled the Middle Ground. On the eastern side of the Middle Ground is\r\nthe Hollander’s Deep (Hollaender-dyb). In the King’s Deep the water\r\nis shallower on the eastern than on the western side. The admirals\r\nwere ignorant of this fact, for their pilots served them ill. These\r\nso-called pilots were in fact mostly mates of merchant ships who had\r\ntraded to the Baltic. They knew just as much as was needed for their\r\ntrade, and proved both timid and untrustworthy. To fall on from Hveen\r\nat the north end of the Danish line would have been to take the bull\r\nby the horns, for the fleet must have begun by meeting the fire of\r\nthe Trekroner and of the heavy ships the Danes had placed close by\r\nthe forts. If the southern end was to be attacked then the fleet must\r\nfirst go down the Hollander’s Deep, turn the end of the Middle Ground,\r\nand work up the King’s Deep, where the navigable passage is barely\r\nthree-quarters of a mile wide. The waters were so little known that\r\nour officers had no security that the thing could be done, and in any\r\ncase it was absolutely necessary to have the aid of a south-easterly\r\nwind. The obstacles were so serious that when a council of war held\r\nin Parker’s flagship, the =London=, on the night of the 30th, some\r\nvoices were for abstaining from attack. But Nelson was strong for\r\nenergetic action. He offered to give battle to the Danes, attacking by\r\nthe south end himself with ten ships. Sir Hyde Parker was persuaded\r\nby his energy, gave his consent, and added two ships to the ten sail\r\nasked for by Nelson. He did well to give them, but the naval position\r\nof England would not be what it is if many of her admirals had been so\r\npoor of spirit as to be ready to leave the peril and glory of battle to\r\nsubordinates.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st Nelson reconnoitred the Hollander’s Deep. On the 1st April,\r\nthe fleet weighed and anchored to the N.W. of the Middle Ground. In\r\nthe afternoon Nelson took the ships assigned to the south end of the\r\nGround and anchored for the night. His squadron was composed of the\r\n=Elephant=, 74, Captain Foley, the flagship; =Defiance=, flagship\r\nof Rear-Admiral Graves, whose captain was R. Retalick; =Edgar=, 74,\r\nCaptain Murray; =Monarch=, 74, Captain Mosse; =Bellona=, 74, Sir. T.\r\nB. Thompson; =Ganges=, 74, Captain Fremantle; =Russell=, 74, Captain\r\nCuming; =Agamemnon=, 64, Captain Fancourt; =Ardent=, 64, Captain\r\nBertie; =Polyphemus=, 64, Captain Lawford; =Glatton=, 54, Captain\r\nBligh; and =Isis=, 50, Captain Walker. There were also eighteen\r\nfrigates, sloops, bombs, and fireships. The Danes, counting them from\r\nsouth to north, were the _Prövesteen_, 56, a three-decker cut down\r\nwithout masts; _Valkyrien_, 48, two-decker without masts; _Rendsborg_,\r\n20, transport; _Nyborg_, 20, transport; _Jylland_, 48, two-decker,\r\nwithout masts; _Suœrdfisken_, 20, floating battery, masted; _Kronborg_,\r\n22, frigate, without masts; _Elven_, 6, sloop rigged; _Gerner_, 24,\r\nbattery, mastless; _Aggershuus_, 20, transport, mastless; _Sjcelland_,\r\n7, two-decker, unrigged, _Charlotte Amalie_, 26, Indiaman; _Söhesten_,\r\n18, masted, battery; _Holsteen_, 60, rigged line-of-battle ship;\r\n_Infödstretten_, 64, two-decker, masted; _Hjeelperen_, 6, rigged\r\nfrigate; _Elephantin_, 70, line-of-battle ship without masts; _Maro_,\r\n74, line-of-battle ship, mastless; _Denmark_, 74, rigged line-of-battle\r\nship; _Trekroner_, 74, ditto; _Iris_, 40, rigged frigate; _Tarpen_,\r\n18, rigged brig; _Nidelven_, 8, ditto; and ten small craft of four\r\nguns each. A glance at these lists is enough to show which of these\r\ntwo forces was the more powerful. Even putting aside the ordnance\r\ncarried—which was 1014 pieces for the English, and 696 for the Danes,\r\nincluding the Trekroner forts—our opponent marshalled a number of weak\r\nlittle vessels quite unfit to meet the shock of the broadside of a\r\nline-of-battle ship.\r\n\r\nThe night before the battle was spent by the English fleet in further\r\nsoundings in the unknown waters about it, and by Nelson in drawing up\r\nhis final dispositions. It was his intention to enter the King’s Deep\r\nfrom the south, and advance as far as the Trekroner battery. It was\r\nvery naturally understood that Sir Hyde Parker should give his support\r\nby attacking the north end of the Danish line with the ships which\r\nremained with him. They were the =London=, 98, W. Domett, 1st captain,\r\nCaptain R. W. Otway, 2nd captain; and =St. George=, 98, Captain Hardy.\r\nShe was, properly speaking, Nelson’s flagship, but he left her for the\r\nmore handy =Elephant=, and Hardy accompanied on the day of battle. The\r\nothers were the =Warrior=, 74, Captain Tyler; =Defence=, 74, Captain\r\nLord Henry Paulet; =Saturn=, 74, Captain Lambert; =Ramillies=, 74,\r\nCaptain Dixon; =Raisonable=, 64, Captain Dilkes; and =Veteran=, 64,\r\nCaptain Dickson.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew fair from the S.E. on the morning of the 2nd April,\r\nand the signal to attack was given at 9.30. The ships stood in with\r\nvarious fortunes. The =Agamemnon=, which was to have led, had anchored\r\non the east of the Middle Ground, and was not able to round the point.\r\nHer place as leader was taken by the =Edgar= which advanced till she\r\nwas abreast of the _Nyborg_, the fourth ship in the Danish line, and\r\nthen anchored by the stern. Then the =Polyphemus= anchored on the\r\nport bow of the first Dane, the _Prövesteen_. The =Isis= passed the\r\n=Polyphemus= and anchored on the quarter of the _Prövesteen_. The two\r\nvessels which followed, the =Bellona= and the =Russell=, misled by the\r\nmistaken belief that the water was deepest on the side of the Middle\r\nGround, went too near the shoal water and grounded. Their misfortune,\r\nlike the similar bad luck of the =Culloden= at the battle of the Nile,\r\nacted as a warning to those behind. The first of these, the =Elephant=,\r\nstarboarded her helm, avoided the shallows, and took her station\r\nopposite the centre of the Danish line, where she had only the _Elven_\r\nand the _Dannebrog_ opposed to her. The =Glatton= and =Ardent= anchored\r\nbetween the =Elephant= and the =Edgar=. The =Ganges=, =Monarch=, and\r\n=Defiance= went ahead of the =Elephant=. The =Defiance=, the furthest\r\nto the north of our ships, did not reach the northernmost point of\r\nthe Danish line. The English bombs were stationed behind the centre\r\nof the line. Thus the Trekroner forts and the heavy ships near them\r\nwere attacked only by the frigates under Captain Riou, which suffered\r\nseverely. Parker detached three of the ships he had retained, the\r\n=Veteran=, =Ramillies=, and the =Defence= to assail the Trekroner from\r\nthe north, but they had to tack against the S.E. wind, and could not\r\nreach a position in which they could be of service in time. The action\r\nbegan at 10 a.m. All the English ships were in position by 11.30, and\r\nthe action was of the hottest till about one o’clock. The Danes fought\r\nvery stoutly, and as men fell their places were taken by volunteers\r\nfrom the shore.\r\n\r\nColonel Stewart has left a most lively account of the bearing of Nelson\r\nin the midst of the conflict. In his narrative we see the small and\r\nalert figure of the admiral pacing his quarter-deck, the stump of his\r\nright arm leaping with a nervous movement, and his whole being uplifted\r\nwith exultation. The work was hot, he said, but not for the world would\r\nhe be elsewhere. It was the unaffected expression of the true nature\r\nof a man to whom the _gaudia certaminis_ was no idle phrase. Yet the\r\n=Elephant= had but feeble adversaries, and was among the least severely\r\ntried ships in the line. Her 10 killed and 13 wounded was a trifling\r\nloss beside the 24 killed and 51 wounded of the =Defiance=, the 31\r\nkilled and 111 wounded of the =Edgar=, the 30 killed and 64 wounded of\r\nthe =Ardent=, the 33 killed and 88 wounded of the =Isis=, an enormous\r\nproportion for a 50-gun ship. All were surpassed by the casualty list\r\nof the =Monarch=, the heaviest suffered by any of our line-of-battle\r\nships in the war, 56, including her captain, Mosse, killed, and 164\r\nwounded, a full third of her crew. Seen from the deck of the =London=,\r\nthe position of the squadron looked more perilous even than it was.\r\nSir Hyde Parker, influenced perhaps by Captain Domett was early\r\ninclined to hoist a signal of recall. There was a discussion between\r\nKim, Domett, and the captain of the =London=, Waller Otway. Finally\r\nit was decided that Domett should go to the =Elephant= with a message\r\nto Nelson telling him that he was free to obey the signal to retire\r\nor to disregard it, as he judged fit. Domett did not go, for while he\r\nwas changing his dress Captain Otway, who is our authority for the\r\nstory, jumped into a passing boat to carry the message. He reached the\r\n=Elephant= through many perils, but before he was alongside, the signal\r\nhad been hoisted and disregarded. Nelson, whose bearing shows that he\r\nregarded the signal as an order and not as a permission, did not repeat\r\nit. He gave expression to his derision by putting his telescope to his\r\nblind eye and declaring that he could not see the signal.\r\n\r\nThe order was in fact foolish in the extreme, for the squadron could\r\nonly retire before the south-east wind through the narrow passage\r\nin front of the Trekroner forts. The signal was disregarded by\r\nRear-Admiral Graves, and obeyed only by Riou’s frigates, which were\r\ngetting the worst of it in their engagement with the forts. They\r\nretired, and Riou was killed in the retreat. Moreover, the fire in the\r\nsouthern end of the Danish line was slackening. Vessels were silenced\r\nand driven out of the line. In some cases the overpowered ships were\r\nremanned from the shore and the fire resumed. There was nothing\r\nirregular in this action of the Danes. They were perfectly entitled\r\nto retake prizes if they could, and a ship was not even a prize till\r\npossession was taken by the captors. But Nelson seized the opportunity\r\nto bring the action to an end. He sent his letter to the Prince Regent\r\nof Denmark, claiming a right to take undisturbed possession of the\r\nvessels which had struck, and calling the Danes brothers. The Prince\r\nRegent might well have treated the letter as a cry of distress. But he\r\nhad good reason to avail himself of the opportunity to put a stop to\r\nthe battle with credit. He knew that the Northern Coalition was in fact\r\ndissolved before the battle began. He had been informed on the eve of\r\nthe 2nd April that the Czar, Paul, had been murdered in the night of\r\nthe 24th March, and he was well aware that the new Czar, Alexander I.,\r\nwould not be allowed to follow his father’s policy. Therefore he agreed\r\nto arrange an armistice, and consented to stop his fire. Nelson took\r\npossession of his prizes and hastened to evacuate the field of battle\r\nhe had won. The =Elephant= and =Defiance= grounded on their way out, a\r\npretty clear indication of what must have happened if Parker’s signal\r\nhad been obeyed under the fire of the forts. Nelson’s qualities as a\r\nfighter of battles were never more conspicuously shown than in this\r\naction, and they are not discredited in the least by the fact that,\r\nas many great captains have done (and will do to the end of time), he\r\npieced out the hide of the lion by the skin of the fox.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the operations in the Baltic were of the nature of\r\nformalities. The Swedes would not risk the six liners they had in\r\ncommission. While the fleet was in Kjöge Bay the Russians made\r\nproposals for an armistice which it was much our interest to accept.\r\nSir Hyde Parker was recalled on the 5th May. Nelson, to whom the\r\ncommand came, hurried to Revel in the hope of catching the Russian\r\nsquadron. He arrived on the 14th, eleven days after the Russians had\r\ncut their way through the ice and had sailed to Cronstadt. The polite\r\nletter he wrote to the Russian Government and his offer of a visit to\r\nSt. Petersburg, were met with the dry comment that his words were not\r\nconsistent with his actions, and a firm intimation that he must go\r\naway. He growled, but he went, and on the 19th June he left the Baltic\r\nat his own request.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the Northern Coalition threw Napoleon into one of those\r\nfits of convulsive fury in which he stormed with all the epileptic\r\nrage of an Italian plebeian. He found what consolation he could in\r\naccusing the English Government of having paid for the murder of the\r\nCzar. But he still persevered in his efforts to send direct help to\r\nhis army in Egypt. As we have seen, he was driving Ganteaume hard all\r\nthrough the spring. And he had another scheme on hand—a scheme which\r\nwas the forerunner of larger plans to be laid in the course of the\r\nnext few years. The French Government had purchased six Spanish ships\r\nof the line then lying at Cadiz. They were to be manned by French\r\ncrews and commanded by Dumanoir Lepelley. The three French liners of\r\nGanteaume’s squadron, discarded by him at Leghorn, the _Indomptable_\r\nand _Formidable_ of 80, and the _Desaix_, 74, were to sail from Toulon\r\nto Cadiz. The nine were then to be joined by six Spaniards under Don\r\nJuan Joaquin Moreno, and the fifteen were to sail for Egypt, picking up\r\nsoldiers in Italy on their way. It would be rash to say that Napoleon\r\nwould not have made movements corresponding to these with his armies.\r\nHe did many rash things with his armies, and while he was aided by\r\nfortune and the timidity of his opponents his audacity was successful.\r\nBut on land his armies were handled by himself, were superior in\r\nquality, and his opponents were nervous. At sea such daring was too\r\nbold, for the superiority lay with the English. They knew it and were\r\nconfident. In this case the plan was particularly wild, because Sir\r\nJames Saumarez, an excellent officer, was cruising in the Straits, with\r\nseven sail of the line, and was therefore at the very meeting-place of\r\nthese forces.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th June the three French ships named above, together with the\r\n_Muiron_, 38, a frigate taken from the Venetians, left Toulon under\r\nRear-Admiral Durand Linois, carrying a detachment of troops, under\r\nGeneral Devaux. Ganteaume was in the midst of his rush to Egypt and\r\nback. Warren, whose station was the Gulf of Lyons, was away looking for\r\nhim. Linois was able to leave the Gulf unopposed, but not unobserved by\r\nthe frigates Warren had left behind him. Those, and they are apparently\r\nmany, who suppose that a port can “command” a sea may observe that\r\nMinorca proved no obstacle to Linois. His voyage was slow, and it\r\nwas not till the 1st July that he passed Gibraltar. He was informed\r\nthat there were only two English ships off Cadiz. On the 3rd July he\r\ncaptured the brig =Speedy=, commanded by Lord Cochrane, afterwards the\r\nfamous Earl Dundonald, and learnt that there were in fact seven, and\r\nthat they were across his road. Napoleon had spoilt, or had materially\r\nhelped to spoil, his own plan for the relief of Egypt by his cunning.\r\nHe had spread a story that the united French and Spanish ships were to\r\nattack Lisbon. His purpose was to draw the attention of the English\r\nGovernment from the Levant. What he did was to convince his enemy that\r\nCadiz must be closely watched, for Lisbon was not only the capital of\r\nour most trustworthy ally in Europe, but was a most important depôt\r\nof English trade. Therefore Saumarez had been sent from England on\r\nthe 15th June with the =Cæsar=, 80, =Pompée=, 74, =Spencer=, 74,\r\n=Hannibal=, 74, =Audacious=, 74, =Thames=, =Phæton=, frigates, and the\r\n=Plymouth= lugger. He was joined in the Straits by the =Venerable=, 74,\r\nand =Superb=, 74.\r\n\r\nHere then was a warning example of what was likely to be the end of all\r\nschemes for uniting squadrons which started from far distant ports,\r\nand in the face of an alert enemy who operated on interior lines.\r\nThey could only succeed if these squadrons to be thus united had been\r\nefficient. And then all this ingenuity would have been superfluous.\r\nSaumarez could not have kept his station outside of Cadiz for\r\ntwenty-four hours if the thirteen Spaniards, then in the port, had been\r\nmore than the vain show of a squadron.\r\n\r\nWhen he discovered what was in front of him Linois turned into\r\nAlgeciras Bay and anchored on the west side. On the south he was\r\ncovered by the Isla Verde, where there was a Spanish fort. On the\r\nnorth he was supported by the battery Santiago. The shore is foul\r\nwith rocks. There were fifteen Spanish gunboats to give him help. He\r\nanchored the _Formidable_ at the north end, opposite the Santiago fort;\r\nsouth of her was the _Desaix_, and next to her the _Indomptable_. The\r\n_Muiron_ was placed north-west of the Isla Verde. On the 5th July\r\nSaumarez, acting on the established rule of the navy, attacked. He had\r\nwith him six of his seven liners, for Captain Keats of the =Superb=,\r\nwho had just been detached to the mouth of the Guadalquivir, was unable\r\nto rejoin in time. The English squadron rounded Cabrita point at about\r\neight a.m., and fell on as well as they could. For fortune helped the\r\nFrench greatly. The wind was light and erratic. The English ships could\r\nnot come into action either when or where they wished. Linois landed\r\nsoldiers to fight the ill-manned Spanish forts. The English ships at\r\nthe mercy of alternate puffs of wind and calms, could not come into\r\naction together, and were badly mauled. The =Cæsar=, which engaged the\r\n_Formidable_ and the _Desaix_, was nearly beaten to pieces. But the\r\nworst fate befell the =Hannibal=, Captain Ferris, for she grounded, was\r\nshattered thoroughly, and compelled to surrender. The French ships had\r\ncut their cables and had beached themselves. Saumarez too had drawn\r\noff, finding it impossible to press his attack thoroughly home.\r\n\r\nThe check was a shrewd one, for nothing could hide the fact that six\r\nEnglish ships of the line had attacked three French, supported by\r\nbatteries and gunboats it is true, and had drawn off with the loss of\r\none of their number. We had 121 killed and 240 wounded. The =Hannibal=\r\ncontributed 74 to the list of killed, and the survivors were prisoners.\r\nThe French confessed to 306 killed, and the wounded must have been more\r\nnumerous, but there is a doubt as to the numbers. The Spaniards too\r\nlost men. Yet the allies could claim a success, though after all it\r\nonly helped to prove the essential weakness of Napoleon’s plan. Linois\r\nwas sure that he would be attacked by fireships, and appealed to his\r\nfriends at Cadiz for help. On the 9th the Spanish admiral, Moreno,\r\ncame round with six sail of the line to escort Linois. On the 12th the\r\nnine, having their prize the =Hannibal= in tow, sailed for Cadiz. Their\r\nfortunes before they got there showed how unfit they were to contend\r\nwith English squadrons at sea. Saumarez’ squadron had been refitted\r\nwith energy. The =Cæsar= was got ready by miracles of hard work on\r\nthe part of her crew and of seamanship on the part of her captain,\r\nJahleel Brenton. The =Superb=, at once rejoined, and the six followed\r\nthe nine allies, who went off in flight. During the night the pursuing\r\nEnglish squadron forced on an action. The enemy, going off in what was\r\nto have been a line abreast, but rapidly became a confused huddle,\r\ncould only fight feebly in retreat. Two of the Spanish ships, the\r\nmighty three-deckers, _San Hermenegildo_ and _Real Carlos_, caught fire\r\nand blew up, with the loss of nearly all the 2000 men they carried.\r\nThe rest of the allies hurried as best they could to Cadiz, followed\r\nby the English. Luck again helped the French, for the =Venerable=\r\ngrounded on the San Pedro rock while tackling the _Formidable_. But the\r\ncombination scheme had broken down, and Saumarez, in spite of the check\r\nin Algeciras Bay, had, said St. Vincent, “put us on velvet.”\r\n\r\nTurning movements, evasions, combinations, and coalitions had all\r\nfailed. The threat of direct attack was kept up till the armistice,\r\nwhich was the preliminary to the Peace of Amiens, was signed on the 1st\r\nOctober. Napoleon persevered in collecting small craft to be used for\r\nthe purpose of carrying an army to the shore of England. The scheme\r\nwas as old as the reign of Louis XV., and, as we have seen, had been\r\nrevived by the Directory in a feeble way. The invasion flotilla was\r\nto be taken up again by Napoleon himself on a far larger scale two\r\nyears after 1801. It will be most appropriately discussed under the\r\nlater date. The policy of the First Consul in 1801 cannot be taken\r\nas indicating a serious intention to attempt the invasion of England\r\nat that time and with the resources then at his disposal. He brought\r\ntroops to the coast, and collected small transports, in order to\r\ninspire fear in England, and thereby put pressure on her Government to\r\nmake the peace which was greatly desired by the country, tired as it\r\nwas by the strain of a long and laborious war. His aim was attained to\r\nsome extent. The seamen indeed treated the flotilla with contempt for\r\nsubstantial reasons, which were excellently stated by Captain Beaver in\r\na paper which the reader will find printed as an appendix to his life\r\nby Admiral Smyth. He pointed out that a swarm of small craft built\r\nflat, so that they could work in shallow water and be beached, and\r\ntherefore leewardly, would be swept hither and thither in the currents\r\nof the Channel. But the seamen failed to persuade their countrymen. It\r\nhas also been at all times impossible to convince soldiers that the\r\nChannel and the North Sea cannot be crossed by an army as if they were\r\nrivers. All the persons rudely described by St. Vincent as the “old\r\nwomen” in and out of Parliament were greatly disturbed by the invasion\r\nflotilla.\r\n\r\nThe Government was manifestly under an obligation to act against the\r\nflotilla with vigour. It took the very best course it could find both\r\nto quiet the mind of the country and to make sure that its directness\r\nwould be vigorously applied. It put Nelson in command of what may\r\nbe called a counter flotilla, operating from the coast between\r\nOrfordness and Beachy Head, against the French flotilla, which was\r\nbeing concentrated for the threatened dash at Boulogne. He hoisted his\r\nflag in the =Medusa= frigate in the Downs on the 30th July, and went\r\ninstantly to work like the born fighter he was. The effectual course\r\nwould have been to land soldiers, take Boulogne, and burn the flotilla.\r\nBut our small army was quite unable to provide the 80,000 or 100,000\r\nmen needed for an offensive movement against the numerous troops of\r\nNapoleon. There was nothing for it but to hit at his naval forces\r\nwith naval forces. The result of the manful efforts we made was no\r\nsurprise to the seamen. It was found to be impossible to prevent small\r\nflat-bottomed craft, which could take the ground at low tide, and hug\r\nthe shore at high tide, from creeping along from creek to creek, and\r\nshore battery to shore battery. The large vessels could not get near\r\nenough to them on the shallow coast to do harm with the artillery of\r\nthe time, which had an effective range of about 1200 yards. With the\r\nhelp of support from the shore they could generally deal with small\r\ncraft and boats. Therefore they could be concentrated at Boulogne. When\r\nthere they were collected at that point, and they could be protected.\r\nThe Boulogne flotilla was bombarded with some, but not much, effect\r\nat its anchorage on the 4th August. We could not bring a sufficiently\r\nheavy force near enough to do serious harm. But to bring the flotilla\r\nto Boulogne was a useless preliminary to real work unless it could get\r\nout. Its inability to make a sortie in open daylight, and with a good\r\nwind, was confessed. What chance it had of succeeding in the venture,\r\nin calm, fog, or long winter night, was shown on the 15th August.\r\n\r\nA quadruple cutting-out expedition on a large scale was then despatched\r\nby Nelson. It consisted of four divisions of armed boats, commanded\r\nrespectively by Captain E. T. Parker, Captain P. Somerville, Captain\r\nCotgrave, and Captain R. Jones. Parker reached the flotilla with his\r\ndivision about midnight, but found that vessels swarming with men,\r\nbarricaded and swathed in boarding nettings, anchored head and stern,\r\nfastened to one another by chains, constituted a floating fortress too\r\nstrong for his boats. He was himself mortally wounded, and his boats\r\nrepulsed with a loss of 21 killed and 42 wounded. The divisions of\r\nCaptain Cotgrave and Captain Somerville were more affected by the tide\r\nthan Parker’s. They reached the French anchorage later than he, and not\r\nwith their boats together. They too were repulsed with loss. Captain\r\nJones’ boats were swept to the eastward and failed to reach the enemy.\r\nIf this happened to the active, well-manned men-of-war boats, what must\r\nhave been the helplessness of the flat-bottomed craft of the flotilla\r\nin the Channel currents. Our total loss was 44 killed and 126 wounded,\r\nwho all fell victims to the necessity for quieting the fears of the\r\n“old women.”\r\n\r\nThe longing of both countries for peace could no longer be disregarded\r\nby their Governments. An armistice was signed on the 1st October, and\r\na so-called peace was signed at Amiens on the 27th March 1802, though\r\nNapoleon most assuredly did not mean it to endure, and no wise man in\r\nEngland believed that it could last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTRAFALGAR\r\n\r\n AUTHORITIES.—The last and the most complete collections of the\r\n     evidence for the events dealt with in this chapter will now\r\n     be found in _Projets et Tentatives de Débarquement aux Iles\r\n     Britannique_, and in the supplementary volume, _La Campagne\r\n     Maritims de 1805—Trafalgar_, by Captain E. Desbrière. See also\r\n     _Trafalgar and the Nelson Touch_, a series of articles with\r\n     ensuing correspondence in the _Times_ for September and October\r\n     1905.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peace signed at Amiens in March 1802 served two useful purposes.\r\nIt gave the nation a breathing space, and it allowed Napoleon an\r\nopportunity to convince all Englishmen who were not beyond being\r\ntaught by experience that with him no lasting peace was possible.\r\nHis annexations, his insolent denial to England of any right to a\r\nvoice in the affairs of the Continent, his dishonesty in the matter\r\nof the withdrawal of the French troops from Holland, his persistence\r\nin calling on England to evacuate Malta, and the hostile measures\r\nagainst English trade which he adopted, soon convinced all but a few\r\nthat war with him was inevitable. There could be no peace with a ruler\r\nwho endeavoured to force England to adhere to the letter of a treaty\r\nwhich he was himself violating daily in spirit and substance. He did\r\nnot believe that peace could be permanent, but trusted that it would\r\nlast till he had found the means to arm against us at sea. In the hope\r\nthat he could revive French shipping by means of a colonial trade, he\r\nsent a great armament to reoccupy the French part of the island of San\r\nDomingo, which had been lost by a revolt of the slaves. Another was\r\nsent to the East Indies provided with instructions how to attack our\r\npossessions. The English Government, urged by public opinion, defeated\r\nhis plans by forcing on war in May 1803.\r\n\r\nThe brevity of the suspension of hostilities allowed no time for\r\nimportant internal changes in the navy, but this interval saw the\r\nbeginning of administrative reforms which were to produce their chief\r\nfruits after 1815. St. Vincent, who had become First Lord in the\r\nAddington Ministry in 1801, was profoundly conscious of the waste and\r\ncorruption which prevailed in the Navy Office. He persuaded, indeed\r\nit may be said that he forced, his colleagues to pass the Act of the\r\n43rd George III., which appointed Commissioners “for inquiring into\r\nirregularities, frauds, and abuses in the Navy Departments, and in\r\nthe business of prize agency.” The Commissioners produced a series of\r\nreports between 1802 and 1805, which revealed much mismanagement and\r\nthe existence of not a little pilfering. The Commission of 1802 was\r\nsucceeded in 1806 by another “for revising and digesting the civil\r\naffairs of the Navy,” which also made reports in 1809. These documents\r\nare full of instruction, but they cannot be analysed and extracted\r\nhere. Their immediate effect was good, for they terrified evil-doers\r\nand aroused the temper of the country. But they produced their main\r\nfruits as late as 1830, and during the administration of Sir James\r\nGraham.[6] St. Vincent, intent on reform, was obstinate in refusing to\r\nbelieve in the renewal of war with France. He was accused of allowing\r\nthe strength of the navy to fall to a dangerously low figure. His\r\nenemies did their best to raise public anger against him, and Pitt\r\nattacked him hotly in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nA little sober investigation reduces these charges to moderate\r\nproportions. St. Vincent’s critics were as unmeasured, and as\r\nindiscriminating in criticising him, as he and his followers were in\r\nscolding the Navy Office. In Parliamentary and other public discussions\r\nour English respect for truth is qualified by a lively sense of the\r\nvalue of loud-mouthed and hectoring accusations of stupidity and\r\nturpitude as instruments of controversy. In March 1803 there were\r\nperhaps not so many vessels in commission as there might have been,\r\nand it is possible that St. Vincent had carried economy too far in\r\nthe dockyards. But the French dockyards were empty, and Napoleon was\r\ntaken completely by surprise—as indeed he confessed. He had exhausted\r\nhis resources by fitting out the fleet sent to San Domingo, and his\r\nnaval arsenals had been stripped bare. Some of the vessels he sent out\r\nwere unable to reach French ports before the renewal of hostilities.\r\nSix of the line took refuge in the Spanish port of Ferrol, and another\r\nhid at Cadiz. Even including these seven, he had only thirteen sail of\r\nthe line ready for sea, and they in bad condition. We had thirty-nine,\r\nand the superiority in frigates was much greater. Thus we were able to\r\nblockade our enemy with overwhelming forces from the beginning. Nelson\r\ntook the command in the Mediterranean; Pellew off Ferrol; Cornwallis\r\noff Brest; Sir Sidney Smith in the North Sea; while Keith took the\r\ncommand of the reserve in the Downs. As for the condition in which\r\nthese squadrons were, we have the word of Sir Edward Pellew, a very\r\ncompetent witness. Speaking in the House of Commons on the 15th March\r\n1804, he said:—\r\n\r\n “I know, Sir, and can assert with confidence that our navy was never\r\n better found, that it was never better supplied, and that our men were\r\n never better fed or better clothed. Have we not all the enemy’s ports\r\n blockaded from Toulon to Flushing? Are we not able to cope anywhere\r\n with any force the enemy dares to send out against us? And do we not\r\n outnumber them at every one of those ports we have blockaded? It would\r\n smack a little of egotism, I fear, were I to speak of myself, but as a\r\n person lately having the command of six ships, I hope I may be allowed\r\n to state to the House how I have been supported in that command. Sir,\r\n during the time I was stationed off Ferrol I had ships passing from\r\n the fleet [_i.e._, the fleet in the Channel] to me, every three weeks\r\n or a month, and so much was the French commander shut up in that port\r\n deceived by these appearances that he was persuaded, and I believe is\r\n to this very hour, that I had twelve ships under my command, and that\r\n I had two squadrons to relieve each other, one of six inside, and one\r\n of six outside.”\r\n\r\nWhen Pellew was speaking, a year after the war began, the whole\r\nsea-going naval force at Napoleon’s disposal, including vessels\r\nbelonging to the Batavian Republic and stationed at the Cape or in the\r\nIndian Ocean, did not exceed, and except on paper did not reach, 48\r\nof the line and 37 frigates. At that time England had in commission\r\n88 ships of the line, 13 ships of 50 guns, 125 frigates, and a swarm\r\nof sloops, gunbrigs, cutters, and “armed ships”—hired merchant-ships\r\ncarrying guns. We had every means of collecting stores, and the French\r\nhad few. The disproportion of force in our favour was so overwhelming,\r\nand was so well known, that it is hard not to feel some contempt for\r\nthe flushings of apprehension and spasms of clamorous terror into which\r\nour fathers were thrown by the fear of invasion.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of our[7] forces was admirably calculated to place\r\nconcentric barriers, elastic, mobile, but tough and impenetrable,\r\nbetween the shores of Great Britain and a Continental assailant. The\r\ninner barrier consisted of the fleet under the command of Lord Keith,\r\nwho had his headquarters in the Downs. He had 21 sail of the line and 6\r\nships of 50 guns, 29 frigates, 26 sloops, 12 bomb-vessels, 25 gunbrigs,\r\n32 cutters and luggers, 19 armed ships. These vessels watched the\r\ncoast of France, and the dependent Batavian Republic from Havre to the\r\nTexel. There was on our own coast a swarm of armed boats:—135 between\r\nYarmouth and Leith; 149 between Southend and Orfordness; 181 between\r\nHastings and the mouth of the Thames; 138 from Poole to Newhaven; 21\r\nat Liverpool, Glasgow, and Greenock; 114 on the coast of Ireland: in\r\nall, 738. Keith’s fleet was also the reserve on which other fleets\r\ncould fall back in case of need. Next, outside of Keith, came the Brest\r\nblockade under Cornwallis:—20 sail of the line, 5 frigates, 1 sloop, 5\r\ncutters, or luggers, or schooners. Beyond Cornwallis was the squadron\r\nwatching Rochefort:—5 sail of the line, 1 frigate, 1 cutter. Then\r\ncame 7 sail of the line, 2 frigates, 1 sloop, 1 cutter, which watched\r\nFerrol. In the Mediterranean, Nelson had 13 sail of the line, 1 50-gun\r\nship, 11 frigates, 10 sloops, 3 bomb-vessels, 6 gunbrigs, 2 cutters. In\r\nthe East Indies were 6 sail of the line, 2 50-gun ships, 7 frigates, 5\r\nsloops. In the West Indies were 8 sail of the line, 1 50-gun ship, 11\r\nfrigates, 20 sloops, and 15 small craft. The vessels doing convoy work\r\nmay be left aside at present.\r\n\r\nAs we had no such army as could assail Napoleon at home, this mighty\r\nforce could only cruise and watch till such time as the Emperor of the\r\nFrench (to give him the title he assumed on the 18th May 1804) put\r\nits strength to the test. He threatened invasion by arrogant word and\r\nostentatious deed. There were then, there are now, it is probable that\r\nthere always will be, disbelievers in the sincerity of his threats.\r\nHe wrapped himself in clouds of lies, and he is not to be believed\r\non his bare word, either when he said he would invade, or when he\r\ndeclared that he had never seriously contemplated invasion. As he said\r\nhimself, he served a merciless taskmaster, “the nature of things,” and\r\nit was in the nature of things that his empire was subject to attack\r\nby the powers of Central and Eastern Europe. He cannot have meant to\r\nattempt an invasion of England at a time when the armies of Austria\r\nwere actually marching against him. We know that during the last months\r\nof 1804 and the first of 1805, when war with Austria seemed imminent,\r\nhe suspended his preparations for an invasion of England, and resumed\r\nthem only when a letter from the Emperor Francis II. gave him assurance\r\nthat he would not be interrupted. But though he was bound to bow to\r\nnecessity, and turn from England when the frontier of the Rhine was in\r\ndanger, it by no means follows that he would not have made the attempt\r\nhad it been at any time possible. He had promised the French to rid\r\nthem of their hereditary enemy England, and he could only make sure of\r\nkeeping his word by invasion. His power depended on his popularity, and\r\nthat depended on victory. He had risen to a towering height by running\r\ngreat risks, and he went on running them to the end, to keep what he\r\nhad won. If he believed anything, he believed that his presence in\r\nEngland at the head of an army would bring the country to submission at\r\nonce, and even to revolution. Assuredly he did mean to run the hazard\r\nof making an invasion, subject always to the leave of “the nature\r\nof things,”—if, that is to say, the forces at his command and the\r\ncircumstances around him allowed of the venture.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to produce reasons for believing that he never\r\nmeant to risk a crossing of the Channel with a flotilla alone. He\r\nhad given conclusive reasons for not running that hazard when the\r\nDirectory made him General of the Army of England in 1797. The swarm\r\nof flat-bottomed boats he collected between the spring of 1803 and the\r\nautumn of 1805, and the army he encamped at Boulogne, were never meant\r\nto act by themselves. The flotilla might be used under protection of a\r\nfleet. The army was very well placed to be drilled, and kept under his\r\nown eye and influence for all service. His assurances that he meant\r\nto invade with the flotilla and army by themselves were designed to\r\nsatisfy public opinion in France, and inspire fear in England. It\r\nmust not be forgotten that Napoleon was betrayed, and knew he was\r\nbetrayed, by people about him who dreaded the consequences of his rule\r\nto France. Their identity is uncertain, though Talleyrand has been\r\nsupposed to have been one of them. Whoever they were, these persons\r\nknown as the “he-friend,” and the “she-friend,” and the “son of the\r\nfriend,” had access to Napoleon’s most secret papers, and communicated\r\nthe substance of them to a certain Count d’Antraigues, an exiled French\r\nRoyalist attached to the Russian mission in Saxony. Through Antraigues\r\nthe information came to the English Government. Napoleon, who knew he\r\nwas betrayed but could not detect the traitors, used countermines to\r\nconfuse and mislead them. Many of the minutes he made and the orders he\r\nissued have much the air of having been designed to reach his enemies\r\nand put them on a false scent.\r\n\r\nWhen the preliminaries of October 1801 were signed, there were 250\r\nflat-bottomed boats in existence of the model brought to France by\r\nMuskeyn. In March 1803 only 136 were available. Napoleon began at once\r\nto repair and strengthen this remnant. His first plan was to add a\r\nmoderate number of flat-bottomed boats, and to draw largely on fishing\r\nand coasting craft for his transports. It was soon found that these\r\nresources would be insufficient. By July 1803 he had adopted plans\r\nfor building 1410 flat-bottomed vessels, and in August the number was\r\nfixed at 2008. They were to be divided into _frames_ of 110 feet by 25,\r\ndrawing 8 feet, rigged as barques; _chaloupes_ of 76 to 80 feet by 17,\r\ndrawing 5 to 6 feet, rigged as brigs; _bateaux cannoniers_ of 60 by 14\r\nfeet, drawing 4½ feet, rigged as luggers; _caiques_—small luggers and\r\nschooners; bomb-vessels, and _péniches_, a species of fishing-boats.\r\nAll carried guns, from the twelve 24-pounders of the _frames_ down to\r\nthe single _obusier_ or shell-firing gun of the _péniches_. They were\r\nbuilt all along the north coast of France, at Paris, on the Rhine and\r\nin Holland. They were brought to their headquarters at Boulogne, down\r\nrivers and canals and by voyages along the coast from fort to fort and\r\ncreek to creek. Harbours were cleared for them, and batteries built for\r\ntheir protection. The most determined efforts on the part of our naval\r\nofficers failed to prevent these craft from collecting in and about\r\nBoulogne. But there Napoleon’s success with them ended. They could not\r\nbe sent to sea. The fine schemes for combining troops and transports\r\nremained mere schemes. The ports cleared for the transports silted up\r\nagain as fast as they were made. When the vessels were anchored in\r\nthe harbours, they could only get out in driblets. When they anchored\r\noutside, they were harassed by English attacks, and injured by gales.\r\nNapoleon was eye-witness to the destruction of a number of them by\r\na gale in June 1804. It is true that we did them but little harm.\r\nOur sea-going ships could not push their attacks home on a shallow\r\ncoast, and we did not build corresponding vessels for the purpose. An\r\nattempt to make an end of them by a species of floating mines called\r\n“catamarans,” much favoured by Mr. Pitt, proved a failure in October\r\n1804. Yet the utmost they could do was to escape destruction. They\r\ncould not go out, as Napoleon knew from the first. His naval officers\r\ntold him the truth with perfect candour.\r\n\r\nSomething else must be done to clear the way for an invading army, and\r\nthere was only one thing which promised success. A force of sea-going\r\nships must be collected to protect the transports. Therefore, from the\r\nend of 1803 till late in 1805, the correspondence of Napoleon is filled\r\nwith elaborate plans for concentrating a fleet in the Channel. These\r\nplans of campaign and the letters written in combination with them\r\nfill hundreds of pages in the vast compilation of Captain Desbrière.\r\nThis most competent French authority is inclined to believe that much\r\nof the vast correspondence was meant to be betrayed and to mislead the\r\nEnglish Government. No other rational explanation can indeed be found\r\nfor the confusing way in which proposals for expeditions to Scotland,\r\nIreland, and the East Indies are mingled with plans for bringing\r\nsquadrons from Brest, Rochefort, Ferrol, Cadiz, and Toulon together in\r\nthe Channel. These alternative schemes, eccentric in every sense of the\r\nword, were never acted on. If they were designed to deceive the British\r\nGovernment, they failed.\r\n\r\nThe solid core of a mass of mere words was the design to concentrate\r\na strong fleet in the Channel. A squadron, or squadrons, of the ships\r\nat Napoleon’s command was, or were, to cross the Atlantic in order\r\nto distract the attention of the English Government and induce it to\r\nsend ships in pursuit. Napoleon’s intention was that his vessels should\r\ncome back and unite in the Channel, where they would have a superiority\r\nover the English who, he calculated, would be weakened by detachments.\r\nThe English Government had early warning that this was in fact his\r\nplan, and prepared to defeat it by a counter policy of concentration.\r\nThe penury of the French dockyards and the time required to build the\r\nflat-bottomed boats compelled Napoleon to delay the application of\r\nhis plan. Seven of his ships were blockaded in Spanish ports, and his\r\nrelations to Spain were peculiar. She was bound by treaty to join him\r\nin the war, but was allowed to compound for armed help by the payment\r\nof a subvention. England might fairly have considered this contribution\r\nto the funds of its enemy, and have declared war on Spain at once. But\r\nit refrained until 6th October 1804, when it seized the home-coming\r\nSpanish treasure ships in the Straits of Gibraltar. Spain declared war\r\nin December. Napoleon’s plans may be divided into those laid before\r\nand those laid after October 1804. It is enough to say of the first,\r\nwhich were never put to the test, that after a variety of hypothetic\r\nsuggestions had been made and rejected, Napoleon decided in favour of\r\nthe comparatively simple scheme that Latouche-Tréville, who commanded\r\nat Toulon, should elude Nelson and head for Rochefort, drive off the\r\nEnglish blockading squadron, and be then ready to co-operate with the\r\nfleet at Brest. There was nothing impossible, or even very hazardous,\r\nin this plan. Nelson made it his boast that he did not blockade Toulon.\r\nHe only watched the port by frigates, remaining on the coast of\r\nSardinia with his liners, hoping that the French would come out, and\r\nthat he would be able to bring them to battle. He had every right to\r\nrely on victory if a battle could be secured; but, as the future was\r\nto show, he was not entitled to calculate on meeting the Toulon fleet.\r\nSuccess would depend on the receipt of prompt information from his\r\nfrigates, but Nelson remained far from Toulon, he allowed his squadron\r\nto drive in the north-easterly winds, and was seldom at his rendezvous,\r\nand so days often passed before the frigates could find his flag. It\r\nwas, too, a fixed idea of his, that if the French left Toulon, it\r\nwould be for the purpose of renewing their disastrous adventure in\r\nEgypt. Napoleon, who read his mind with remarkable sagacity, and who\r\nranked his judgment low, had calculated on this very fixed idea of\r\nthe English admiral’s as an element in his own favour. It is by no\r\nmeans improbable that the concentration at Rochefort might have been\r\neffected if the resources of the Toulon yard had been greater. But the\r\nsquadron was fitted for sea with difficulty. Latouche-Tréville died on\r\nthe 20th August 1804. His successor had to be selected, and then came\r\nthe war between Spain and England, which brought a new element into the\r\nproblem. At that moment, too, there was a strong probability that war\r\nwould break out with Prussia and Austria. The invasion schemes were\r\nhung up, and in September Napoleon was intent on organising attacks on\r\nEngland’s colonies. Even these were designed to draw off English forces\r\nfrom home waters and leave the road free for a push from Brest and\r\nBoulogne. Their real purpose was known to the English Government, which\r\nwas warned by its secret agents, and showed itself well aware of its\r\nenemy’s purpose.\r\n\r\nVilleneuve was chosen to succeed Latouche-Tréville, mainly because\r\nthe emperor looked upon him as a lucky man, and because that was a\r\nvaluable quality in the prevailing dearth of capable admirals. On\r\nthe 12th December 1804 orders were sent to Villeneuve to prepare for\r\na great expedition to the West Indies, where he was to be joined by\r\nMissiessy with the squadron from Rochefort. They were to capture\r\ncolonies, and after a stay of sixty days to come back to Rochefort.\r\nNothing was said of ulterior movements in the instructions to them.\r\nBut orders of nearly the same date were sent to Ganteaume at Brest to\r\nget to sea, make a commerce-destroying cruise on the coast of Ireland,\r\ngo to Ferrol, pick up the French and Spanish ships there, and join\r\nVilleneuve and Missiessy on their return from the West Indies. If the\r\nconcentration was effected, Napoleon would have, so he thought, that\r\ncommand of the Channel which, as he told Latouche in July, would make\r\nhim master of the world. But he was trying to overreach his taskmaster,\r\n“the nature of things.” Such a scheme could succeed only by a truly\r\nwonderful combination of capacity on the part of his officers, of\r\nincapacity on the part of the English officers, and of good fortune.\r\nTwo parts out of three of the scheme failed. Missiessy did indeed get\r\naway from Rochefort on the 11th January 1805, reached the West Indies,\r\ndid considerable damage to our trade, and got safe back by the 20th\r\nMay. Ganteaume was unable to get to sea without a battle with the\r\nblockading fleet, and he was forbidden to fight. Villeneuve got to sea\r\non the 17th January, when a north-easterly gale had forced the English\r\nlook-out frigates off the coast. The result did to some extent justify\r\nNapoleon’s foresight. Nelson, who heard on the 19th that Villeneuve\r\nwas at sea, acted on his fixed idea that Egypt was the object of the\r\nFrench, went to look for them in the Levant, and was not back to his\r\nrendezvous in Sardinia till the 27th February. But Villeneuve had been\r\ndriven back on the 20th January by bad weather. On the 22nd he wrote a\r\nletter to his friend the Minister of Marine, Decrès, which if Napoleon\r\nhad seen it and had known where to look for a more resolute officer\r\nwould have caused his instant dismissal. It can be compared only with\r\nthe piteous letter in which the Duke of Medina Sidonia implored Philip\r\nII. not to give him the command of the Armada. Villeneuve declared\r\nthat he had always longed for a useful but not for a glorious career;\r\nthat this enterprise he was sent on could end in nothing but disgrace;\r\nthat his ships looked very well in harbour, but were helpless at sea;\r\nthat the troops given him to attack the English islands were a pest;\r\nand that he wished the emperor would name his successor. Napoleon\r\nwas exasperated with the admiral’s “lack of decision.” Yet he had to\r\naccept Villeneuve also as part of “the nature of things.” At first the\r\nproposed combination was given up. Orders were sent to Missiessy to\r\nconsider himself independent, and they reached him. In a short time\r\nNapoleon received assurance from Austria which convinced him that he\r\nwas for a time safe from molestation. In March the great combination\r\nscheme was taken up again. Counter orders to wait for Villeneuve were\r\nsent to Missiessy, but failed to reach him. On the 2nd March orders\r\nwere sent to Ganteaume to sail for Ferrol, pick up the French and\r\nSpanish ships, go to Martinique to join Villeneuve, and then head\r\nback for the Channel. On the same day orders went to Villeneuve to\r\nsail to the West Indies, and wait for Ganteaume at Martinique for\r\nforty days. If he failed to appear, Villeneuve was to return by San\r\nDomingo and the Canaries, waiting for him there once more, and on\r\nhis failure to appear, was to go to Cadiz. All was to depend on the\r\nsuccess of Ganteaume in getting away. “The nature of things” was to be\r\noverreached. But it is not so easy to overreach “the nature of things.”\r\nThe concentration broke down first because Missiessy did not receive\r\nhis counter orders, and therefore did not wait for Villeneuve, and then\r\nbecause Ganteaume failed to leave Brest. He was too closely watched by\r\nCornwallis.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th March, Villeneuve got away from Toulon with eleven sail of\r\nthe line. Nelson’s policy of no-blockade produced the effect which some\r\nnaval officers at least had foreseen. The French fleet was sighted on\r\nthe 31st March, thirty-five miles south of Toulon, by the =Phœbe= and\r\n=Active= frigates. The =Phœbe= went in search of Nelson, who was at the\r\nGulf of Palmas, in Sardinia, on that day; but she did not report to him\r\ntill the 4th April, for he had left Palmas on the 3rd to water at Pula.\r\nVilleneuve, who had heard that Nelson was at Palmas, steered to the\r\nwest of the Balearic Islands, and was missed by him. It is strange that\r\nthe British Government knowing what it knew of Napoleon’s intentions,\r\nand having adopted the proper counter-policy of concentration in the\r\nChannel, had not ordered its admiral in the Mediterranean to disregard\r\nthe imaginary danger to Egypt. Once more Nelson manœuvred to protect\r\nwhat the French were not attacking. He stretched his look-out ships\r\nfrom the south of Sardinia to the coast of Africa, and went to Palermo.\r\nOn the 16th April he was at the south end of Sardinia, and on that\r\ndate he learned that Villeneuve had passed the Straits of Gibraltar\r\neight days before. The French admiral had stopped outside the Spanish\r\nharbour of Carthagena on the 7th, and had called on Admiral Salcedo to\r\njoin him. The Spaniard excused himself, and Villeneuve went on to Cadiz\r\nthat night. He drove off the blockading squadron of Sir John Orde—six\r\nsail of the line and frigates. Orde retired to a safe distance, and\r\nthen sailed to join Cornwallis in the Channel. On the 9th, Villeneuve\r\nreached Cadiz, where he was at once joined by the _Aigle_ and the\r\nSpanish admiral, Gravina. Most of the Spanish vessels, six in number,\r\nwere unable to be in time to sail with the French. The allies\r\nstraggled across the Atlantic, and had the good fortune to unite their\r\neighteen sail at Fort de France in Martinique by the 16th May.\r\n\r\nWhen the French admiral reached the Antilles, he had no other orders\r\nthan those dated the 2nd March, which directed him to wait for\r\nGanteaume at Martinique for forty days, and then to cruise among the\r\nCanary Islands. He therefore waited, and undertook no other operation\r\nthan the recapture of the Diamond Rock, then held by an English naval\r\ndetachment which was a thorn in the side of the French island. The Rock\r\nwas retaken on the 31st May, but on the previous day Villeneuve had\r\nbeen joined by the _Didon_ from Rochefort. She brought orders which\r\nwere well calculated to disturb him. They were dated the 14th April,\r\nand after informing him that he was to be joined by Rear-Admiral Magon\r\nfrom Rochefort with two sail of the line, instructed him to wait in the\r\nislands for another month, to distinguish himself by taking English\r\nislands, to come to Ferrol, join the French and Spanish ships there,\r\nand head for Brest and Boulogne. These orders implied that Villeneuve\r\nmust be prepared to fight a battle in the Channel. The admiral, who\r\nwell knew the defects of the ships with him, and who could judge that\r\nthe raw ships at Ferrol would be still less capable of meeting the\r\nEnglish, was sorely disturbed at the prospect of having to undertake\r\nsuch a venture at the head of such a force. He knew, too, that lack\r\nof provisions would make it impossible for him to remain for a month\r\nin the West Indies, while he had every reason to fear that his enemy,\r\nwho must by this time have learned his whereabouts, would attack him.\r\nHe was aware that Admiral Cochrane, who had been sent from before\r\nFerrol in March, was in the West Indies with six sail. It was a simple\r\nenough business to attack the English islands. When, therefore, Magon\r\njoined him on the 4th June, Villeneuve embarked more soldiers from the\r\ngarrisons of the islands, and sailed to assail Antigua. On the 10th\r\nhe captured an English convoy near the island, and learned from his\r\nprisoners that Nelson had reached Barbadoes in pursuit of him on the\r\n4th.\r\n\r\nThe English admiral had paid dearly in anxiety for the looseness of\r\nthe watch he kept on Toulon. When he was informed that the French\r\nsquadron had left the Mediterranean, he hurried in pursuit. But the\r\nwind was against him. He reached Tetuan on the 4th April, and left\r\nnext day, but it was not till the 10th that he anchored in Lagos Bay.\r\nHe had had every cause for anxiety. The French had escaped from the\r\nMediterranean, and he had no indication whither they had gone. He was\r\nalmost equally disposed to sail to the West Indies lest they should be\r\nbound to Jamaica, or to steer for the Scilly Islands in order to be at\r\nhand in case their destination was the Channel or the coast of Ireland.\r\nHis troubles were aggravated by the fact that a convoy of transports\r\ncarrying General Craig and a body of troops bound to Sicily and Naples\r\nhad left England on the 17th April, under protection of Admiral Knight,\r\nwith two line-of-battle ships, the =Queen= and the =Dragon=. It might\r\nhave fallen in with Villeneuve. On the 10th his doubts were removed.\r\nRear-Admiral Campbell, the officer in the Portuguese service who had\r\nwarned Jervis of the neighbourhood of the Spaniards on the day before\r\nthe battle of Cape St. Vincent, now gave Nelson information which\r\nconvinced him that Villeneuve had sailed for the West Indies. The\r\nconvoy with General Craig’s expedition came in, and was sent on its way\r\nto Sicily. Nelson left Bickerton in command in the Mediterranean, and\r\nwith ten ships pursued Villeneuve on the 11th.\r\n\r\nOrde had sent home information of Villeneuve’s escape, and had also\r\ngiven warning to the West Indies. The Admiralty was taking measures\r\nto send Collingwood, then serving in the Channel, in pursuit of\r\nthe French, when it was informed that Nelson had gone on his own\r\nresponsibility. Collingwood was ordered to Cadiz to replace Orde, who\r\nhad shown a lack of precision, and a counter concentration of naval\r\nforces was prepared in the Channel and the approaches to it. The\r\nanxiety in the country was keen. It was said in the press that nobody\r\nin England slept quietly, for there was a very general appreciation\r\nof the real significance of Villeneuve’s cruise. There was so little\r\ndoubt on the subject that on the 9th May a London paper, the _Morning\r\nChronicle_, stated that many were of opinion that the French admiral\r\nwould join the ships at Cadiz and Ferrol and then enter the Channel.\r\nThe public was relieved when it learned that Jamaica was in more danger\r\nthan the mother country.\r\n\r\nWhen Nelson reached Barbadoes, he was misled by circumstantial but\r\nunfounded reports given him by Major-General Brereton into the belief\r\nthat the French had gone south to attack Trinidad and Tobago. He went\r\nimmediately in pursuit to the Gulf of Paria, only to learn that he\r\nhad been misinformed. He at once returned, and was off Martinique on\r\nthe 10th, the very day on which Villeneuve, after hastily sending the\r\ntroops he had drawn from the garrison of Martinique and Guadaloupe back\r\nin frigates, had sailed for Ferrol. Nelson heard of the departure of\r\nVilleneuve at Antigua, and on the 13th he also sailed for Europe. The\r\nFrenchman was undoubtedly right in leaving the West Indies at once.\r\nEven a successful battle (and he did not look upon success as possible)\r\nwould have destroyed his power to carry out what Napoleon in a letter\r\nto him dated the 29th April called the “essential operation,” the union\r\nof the French squadrons in the Channel. But he took too northerly a\r\ncourse, and therefore lengthened his voyage unduly. His mistake had\r\ndisastrous consequences for him. Nelson, when starting to return to\r\nhis proper station in the Mediterranean, despatched the =Curieux=\r\nbrig, Captain Bettesworth, with information for the Admiralty. On the\r\n19th June, Bettesworth sighted the allies 900 miles N.E. of Antigua.\r\nHe pressed on, and in the early hours of the 8th July gave Lord\r\nBarham, the old naval officer who was then First Lord, the news that\r\nVilleneuve was on his way back. The Government was well aware of the\r\nreal purpose of the French fleet. Lord Barham had only to carry out\r\na settled policy when he at once ordered Calder, who had succeeded\r\nCochrane in command of the Ferrol blockade, to call in Rear-Admiral\r\nStirling, who was watching Rochefort, and to bar Villeneuve’s road to\r\nFerrol. Calder received his orders on the 15th, called Stirling to\r\nhis flag, and stationed himself 90 miles west of Finisterre. On the\r\n22nd he sighted the allies to the south of him. Nelson, sailing on a\r\nmore southerly route, had reached Cape St. Vincent on the 17th. He had\r\ngood professional cause for returning to his proper station. Yet it\r\nis strange that even at that hour he remained firm in the faith that\r\nthe ultimate aim of the French was Egypt. If he had read the mind of\r\nNapoleon as Napoleon read his, he would surely have steered for Ferrol.\r\nIn that case, he would have headed Villeneuve, and would have united\r\nhis ten ships to the fifteen then with Calder. The twenty-five would\r\nhave made an end of the twenty French and Spanish ships and of the\r\ngreat invasion scheme at a blow.\r\n\r\nThe mountain fell in labour, and produced a ridiculous mouse. When\r\nCalder saw the allies to the south of him on the 22nd July, he rightly\r\ndecided to attack their twenty sail with his fifteen. His intention\r\nwas to cut through their line and destroy their rear. Calder cannot\r\nbe blamed for failing to carry out his plan, for a dense fog settled\r\ndown on the two fleets. It was so thick that the combatants could not\r\nsee where the vessels nearest to them were save by the flash of their\r\ngun-fire. After preliminary movements of no significance, the fleets\r\nengaged in line ahead, standing to the south. The English to leeward\r\nengaged the van, composed of the Spaniards, and the centre of the\r\nallies. The fire of the Spaniards was so wild that when the English\r\nfrigate =Egyptienne= reconnoitred them before the battle, they failed\r\nto hit her, though by the testimony of her first lieutenant, she went\r\nclose enough “to see the moustachios of the Dons.” Two of the Spanish\r\nships, the _San Rafael_ and the _Firme_, leewardly tubs, sagged through\r\nCalder’s line, and were taken. The fleets separated in the dark after\r\na cannonade which did some damage to masts and spars. The charge of\r\nweakness brought against Admiral Calder is based on his conduct in the\r\ndays following the battle. He showed no desire to renew the action, and\r\nwas very unduly nervous about the part which might be taken against him\r\nby the French and Spanish ships in Ferrol. Yet an officer of a daring\r\nspirit (and at such a crisis it was the duty of every officer to show\r\nthe utmost daring) would have calculated that his fifteen vessels were\r\nquite able to ruin the eighteen enemies in front of them long before\r\nhelp could come out of the land-locked harbour of Ferrol. Even if his\r\nown fleet was to be shattered in the act of destroying the enemy, it\r\nwould still have put a stop to any further movements of theirs in the\r\ndirection of the Channel. Calder was unduly cautious, and it is to be\r\nfeared that he was also unduly over anxious for the safety of his\r\nprizes, the reward of toil and danger. He went off to put them in the\r\nway of safety, very complacently calculating that Villeneuve would go\r\nsouth to Cadiz where Nelson would be waiting for him.\r\n\r\nVilleneuve was well disposed to go to Cadiz, and had Napoleon’s leave\r\nto go if his fleet suffered such injury in battle as should render\r\nit incapable of carrying out the essential operation—which, said the\r\nEmperor sanctimoniously, may God forbid. He had no confidence in his\r\ncommand. On the 6th August, when the impression made on him by the\r\naction of the 22nd July was fresh, he told his friend Decrès that the\r\nFrench and Spanish Navies were incapable of producing large squadrons\r\nfit to meet the English. And such as his force was it was sickly and\r\nhad been weakened by desertion in the West Indies. The decision to go\r\nto Cadiz was to be taken later. When Villeneuve was assured by Gravina\r\nthat their fleets could enter Vigo in the then prevailing wind he\r\ndecided to go thither, and he anchored in the spacious Spanish harbour\r\non the 26th July.\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon heard that the English squadron blockading Rochefort\r\nhad disappeared from before the port, he concluded that Villeneuve\r\nmust be already on his way back, and that the English knew it. The\r\nsquadron brought home in May by Missiessy, and now commanded by\r\nAllemand, was then in Rochefort. It had orders to escape to sea, to\r\ngo on a commerce destroying voyage on the coast of Ireland, and to\r\nmeet Villeneuve if he came back at the time first fixed. The Emperor\r\nnow proposed to send Allemand to meet Villeneuve at once. But he had\r\nsailed before the counter order reached Rochefort. To Villeneuve orders\r\nwere sent almost in profusion. Following a practice which grew on\r\nhim, and was the despair of his generals during the Peninsular War,\r\nNapoleon wanted to regulate everything from a distance, and would keep\r\nsuggesting alternative courses. Yet the general drift of his orders was\r\nplain enough. Villeneuve was not to be enticed into Ferrol, which is\r\ndifficult to leave except in certain states of the wind, was to call\r\nout the French and Spanish ships there, join Allemand, and come on to\r\nBoulogne. If he had been resolute enough to leave the Emperor to answer\r\nfor the consequences in this world and the next, Villeneuve might\r\nhave made a bold stroke, and might at least have failed with honour.\r\nOn the 28th July, six days after the battle off Ferrol, this was the\r\nposition. Keith’s fleet was in the Downs and the North Sea, where,\r\nduring the westerly winds, it could do little to help the ships in the\r\nChannel. Cornwallis, with twenty sail of the line, was watching the\r\ntwenty-two ships of Ganteaume at Brest. There were fourteen French and\r\nSpaniards in Ferrol. Calder, who had not yet divided his force, was\r\nnot far from that port. Allemand, who had sailed later than had been\r\nintended, had wisely not gone to cruise on the coast of Ireland, but\r\nhad placed himself 120 miles to the west of Ferrol, to meet Villeneuve,\r\nwho was at Vigo with eighteen sail, of which, however, three, two\r\nSpaniards and one French, were unfit for further service. Nelson,\r\nwho had been persuaded at last that the French were not aiming at\r\nEgypt (apparently by the arguments of Collingwood), was off Cape St.\r\nVincent on his way home with eleven sail, carrying out spontaneously,\r\nthough tardily, the Government’s policy of concentration. Collingwood,\r\nwith four sail, remained off Cadiz to blockade six Spaniards. Sir R.\r\nBickerton, with another four of the line, was watching another six\r\nSpaniards at Carthagena. On the 1st August Villeneuve left Vigo and\r\nwent to the outer Bay of Ferrol, leaving his three lame ducks behind.\r\nCalder had been forced north by south-westerly winds. Then it was\r\nthat he detached the ships originally taken from before Rochefort. He\r\nreturned with nine sail, and, finding the enemy in force, fell back\r\non the 9th on Cornwallis. Nelson was on his way north, well out at\r\nsea tacking against head winds. On the 11th he was off Ushant, and on\r\nthe 13th he joined Cornwallis. The allies, who were in great need of\r\nstores, did not sail till the 11th. Villeneuve distrusted his fleet\r\nmore profoundly than ever, for, when anchoring in Arosa Bay, his ships\r\nhad all come into collision with one another. He had been told that\r\nAllemand was cruising in search of him, but the _Didon_, which he sent\r\nto meet the Rochefort squadron, was taken by an English frigate. He\r\ncould hear nothing. The wind was against him. Success appeared to him\r\nimpossible, and he was not stern enough to sail to destruction since\r\nhis master would have it so. The weak man, heavily laden, grasped at\r\nthe qualified leave given him to go south, and on the 15th August,\r\nbeing then 200 miles W.N.W. of Finisterre in a N.E. wind, he bore up\r\nfor Cadiz.\r\n\r\nWith the retreat of Villeneuve the great concentration scheme came\r\nto an end. He retired to Cadiz followed by the screaming abuse of\r\nNapoleon, who was justly angry, if only because this ignominious end\r\nto his grand schemes tended to make him the laughing stock of Europe.\r\nWhether he was as angry as he pretended to be is another matter.\r\nRage was one way of persuading the gallery that the failure was not\r\nhis fault. He had a great and thoroughly vulgar capacity for working\r\nhimself into fits of hysterical fury, and for falling to cursing like\r\na very drab. He did not altogether resign the hope of making use of\r\nVilleneuve’s fleet. While washing his hands of all further attention\r\nto details, he gave orders that the combined fleets were to undertake\r\noperations in the Mediterranean. He also decided that Villeneuve was\r\ntoo great a coward to be trusted with the command any longer, and that\r\nhe must be replaced by Admiral Rosily.\r\n\r\nSo far the initiative had belonged to the French, who were the\r\nassailants. Their attack had broken down, and now came the turn of\r\nthe English to assail. When the arrival of Nelson raised the fleet,\r\nunder Cornwallis, to forty sail of the line, the admiral felt so sure\r\nof his position that he did not hesitate to divide his forces. Nelson\r\nwent home to rest, taking two liners with him. Two others were sent\r\nin for repairs. Eighteen were despatched on the 16th, under Calder,\r\nto go in search of Villeneuve. Napoleon called this separation an\r\n_insigne bêtise_, in view of the fact that Villeneuve might have burst\r\ninto the Channel with a force very superior in numbers to the eighteen\r\nsail with Calder, or the seventeen which remained with Cornwallis. He\r\nwould have had thirty-four if he had joined both the Ferrol ships and\r\nAllemand. If fleets and armies were pieces on a draft board, with fixed\r\nunvarying powers, the speculation would be worth following up. But\r\nthey are composed of weapons handled by men who can do but what they\r\ncan. Will an obese man who has one leg shorter than the other and weak\r\nlungs be much the better (he will, of course, be somewhat the better),\r\nif he meets two professional fighters separately, and not together.\r\nIt is quite possible that if Villeneuve had come on, he would have\r\npassed Calder without a meeting. In these very months, Nelson came from\r\nCape St. Vincent to Ushant, through seas crossed by the squadrons of\r\nVilleneuve, Allemand, and Calder, but met none of them. Allemand ranged\r\ndown the coast of the peninsula to the latitude of Cape St. Vincent,\r\nwent back to the Channel, came to the Penmarks, cruised, and waited\r\nfor Villeneuve, till no hope remained that he could come, then turned\r\nto commerce destroying in the Atlantic with immense success, until he\r\nanchored at Aix on the 24th December. But Panic and Flight were our\r\nallies. Cornwallis suffered nothing by the division of his forces. On\r\nthe 20th and 21st August he easily beat back the Brest ships, which\r\nwere forced to make a show of coming out by Napoleon. Villeneuve had\r\nrun for Cadiz before Calder left Ushant. He sighted Cape St. Vincent\r\non the 17th, Allemand being then barely out of sight behind him. On\r\nthe 21st he entered Cadiz observed by Collingwood, who was watching\r\nthe port with three sail of the line, his fourth being then at Tetuan.\r\nCollingwood fell back slowly, just ahead of the pursuing French,\r\nresolved that if they drove him into the Mediterranean, they should be\r\n“backstrapped” into it with him. The allies gave up the pursuit, and\r\nCollingwood, with his three, resumed the watch on Cadiz. He was joined\r\nby the detached ship at Tetuan, by Bickerton from Carthagena, and at\r\nlast by Calder. On the 30th August thirty English sail of the line\r\nwere collected outside Cadiz. It was on the 2nd September that Nelson,\r\nthen at his house at Merton, heard that the allies were in Cadiz. He\r\nhurried to town, and offered his services. It would have been strange\r\nif the Government had declined the offer of its greatest fighter of\r\nbattles at such a moment. Nelson left Spithead with the =Victory= and\r\nthe =Euryalus= frigate on the 15th September, picked up the =Ajax= and\r\n=Thunderer= on the 18th, and joined Collingwood on the 28th.\r\n\r\nThe battle he came to fight was offered him primarily by the obstinacy\r\nof Napoleon, but immediately by the wounded vanity of Villeneuve. The\r\nEmperor had ordered his fleet, and the Spaniards whom he ordered about\r\nas his own, not to suffer themselves to be blockaded by an inferior\r\nforce, but he allowed his orders to sail to stand when he knew that\r\nCollingwood had been reinforced. Decrès, the minister of Marine, did\r\nnot tell Villeneuve that he was to be recalled when Rosily reached\r\nCadiz. The truth reached the unhappy man indirectly, and by public\r\nrumour. In a fit of selfish vanity, he, who had been so cautious in\r\navoiding risks when a great end was to be obtained, now decided to rush\r\nto sea, when no great advantage was to be gained, and when the danger\r\nof destruction was closer than it had been at any moment since he\r\nsailed from Toulon in March—and did it wholly and solely that he might\r\nescape a personal disgrace. By his orders the allied fleet prepared to\r\nput to sea on the 18th October.\r\n\r\nNelson was then cruising some twenty miles west of Cadiz, in a position\r\nto steer for the Straits and intercept the enemy whenever he should\r\ncome out, if, as was nearly certain, he headed for the Mediterranean.\r\nHe had with him twenty-seven sail, and six were at Gibraltar watering\r\nand provisioning. It was on the 19th, when he had just sent Collingwood\r\nan invitation to dinner, that he learnt, through the vessels watching\r\nin shore, that the enemy were coming out. The wearing of the flagship\r\nand the signal for a general chase to the east told the fleet that the\r\nallies were moving. The English ships pressed on to head the enemy,\r\neach at its best rate of speed, so that the fast sailers outstripped\r\nthe slow. The allied fleet had worked out of Cadiz with difficulty.\r\nOn the afternoon of the 20th it was to the south of Cape Trafalgar,\r\nand the English fleet was so near that a battle could not be avoided.\r\nDuring the night our look-out vessels saw the long “lighted street”\r\nof lanterns which marked the position of the allies. The fleet had\r\nreturned from the position attained by the general chase of the 19th,\r\nand was almost back to its cruising ground. The weather had been\r\nvariable from squall and haze to calm. The ships were scattered on\r\nthe morning of the 21st October—a day of very light breeze from N.W.,\r\na heavy swell, and a falling barometer, signs of a coming storm. The\r\nenemy was seen in the E.N.E. about nine miles off, heading south. The\r\nscattered condition of the English ships did not signify much. They\r\nknew what they had to do, and they knew that their enemy was incapable\r\nof baffling any vigorous attack. Immediately after joining the fleet\r\nNelson had held a meeting of senior officers in his flagship and had\r\nexplained his method for disposing of the allies—the Nelson touch. The\r\nmemorandum in which he laid down the principles of his attack remains\r\nto tell us what they were. If the enemy were found to windward, then\r\nthe English fleet was to attack from leeward, which it must do in\r\nclose-hauled lines ahead, and was to be disposed in three such lines.\r\nOne, the lee line, led by the second in command, was to cut off a\r\nsmaller number of the enemy at the rear. The second or weather line,\r\nled by himself, was to cut the formation of the enemy at the centre,\r\nwhere his flagship would be. A third, or advance squadron, was to cut\r\nthrough the enemy ahead of the flagship. Nelson displays his contempt\r\nfor his opponents by two assumptions. One is, that the enemy drawn out\r\nin one very long line would not meet this attack by a counter move,\r\nas D’Orvilliers had baffled Keppel’s menace to the rear of his line\r\nin the battle of Ushant in 1778. The other is that the ships of the\r\nenemy thus cut off, amounting to just more than half, could not be\r\nsuccoured by their van before they were crushed. Supposing the enemy\r\nto be to leeward, then the three lines were to be drawn up opposite\r\nhis centre. The lee line, under the second in command, was to fall all\r\ntogether on a smaller number of the enemy’s rear. The weather line\r\nand advanced squadron were to be used by himself so as to prevent the\r\ncentre and van from turning to support the rear. In this case Nelson\r\ndoes his enemy the compliment of supposing him to be capable of making\r\na counter move. If he inverts his line by wearing together, the English\r\nlee line is to continue to attack the same ships, though they would\r\nnow be van, and not rear. It is clear, however, that if this was done\r\n(and it was the obvious thing to do), the enemy’s rear and centre\r\nhad only to let all draw in order to come at once to the help of the\r\nships assailed. Nelson’s manifest conviction that his enemy could not\r\nmanœuvre, and that his gunnery was bad, was thoroughly justified. It\r\nhas become rather the fashion to affect a “chivalrous” respect for the\r\nenemy at Trafalgar. That is a very pretty sentiment, and is the easier\r\nto feel because the more we make of our foe the more do we make of\r\nour victory. But though the thirty-three ships of the line which left\r\nCadiz with Villeneuve unquestionably carried thousands of gallant men,\r\nthey constituted a very bad fleet. Less than half of them belonged to\r\nthe squadrons which had crossed the Atlantic with Villeneuve. The rest\r\nwere the raw ships from Ferrol, or Spanish vessels manned at Cadiz from\r\nhand to mouth, and at the last moment. Even the most experienced of\r\nthem were incapable of manœuvring, and that by the confession of their\r\nown chiefs. Their gunnery was not only inaccurate, which in very close\r\nfighting was not of the first consequence, but was slow in the case of\r\nthe French, and very slow in the case of the Spaniards. Their powder\r\nwas of inferior quality and fouled the guns quickly.\r\n\r\nIt has become so much the custom to speak of everything Nelson did\r\nas in some sort miraculous that the memorandum has been treated as a\r\nrevelation of original genius. Yet when we look at it coolly it is\r\nobviously only a plan to do deliberately what Duncan did on the spur of\r\nthe moment, and under the pressure of circumstances, at Camperdown. The\r\nresemblance between the battles becomes still closer when we look at\r\nwhat was actually done on the 21st October.\r\n\r\nAfter the sweeping movements and variable weather of the last few\r\ndays, the fleet was in some apparent disorder. The division into three\r\nof the memorandum was not attempted. The ships were in two swarms,\r\nCollingwood’s lee division of fifteen sail, and Nelson’s weather\r\ndivision of twelve.\r\n\r\nNelson’s Division.\r\n\r\n                   { Vice-Admiral Lord\r\n =Victory=    100  {   Nelson.\r\n                   { Capt.

In the meantime the enemy would have been\r\nslipping off. It was ever Nelson’s way to trust to the spirit not\r\nthe letter, the substance and not the mechanical order. “Lord Nelson\r\ndetermined to substitute for exact order an impetuous attack in two\r\ndistinct bodies.” So said Collingwood, writing to a brother seaman,\r\nAdmiral Pasley, and he may really be supposed to have known what his\r\nlifelong friend, who thought him fit to be entrusted with the entire\r\nmanagement of the lee line, meant. “It (Nelson’s plan) was executed\r\nwell and succeeded admirably; probably its novelty was favourable to\r\nus, for the enemy looked for a time when we should form something\r\nlike a line.” There were men in the fleet who thought the plan was\r\nnot executed, because the mere order of going of the memorandum was\r\nnot observed. There was no drawing up in three lines before the\r\nenemy’s centre, no attack in line abreast, or all together at the same\r\nmoment, on an inferior number of the rear ships. Captain Moorsom of\r\nthe =Revenge= thought the plan had been wholly thrown over. So did\r\nIsrael Pellew of the =Conqueror=. But Collingwood, and Codrington of\r\nthe =Orion=, who said they all scrambled into action as best they\r\ncould, inspired by the example of their leaders and the spirit of the\r\nmemorandum, thought overwise. Whatever dubitations there may have\r\nbeen in the minds of men here and there, the whole fleet knew well\r\nenough that they were not asked to display “the froth of discipline\r\nand the tricks of parade.” When signal 72, “Form the order of sailing\r\nin two columns,” went up at seven o’clock, and was followed in a few\r\nmoments by 76, “To bear up and sail large on the course steered by the\r\nadmiral or that pointed out by him,” and the compass direction E.N.E.\r\nwas given, they knew they were to steer for the enemy and fall on his\r\ncentre and rear in such order as time and distance, wind and speed,\r\nand the formation of the allies should allow. To the look-out ships\r\nof the French the English seemed to come up from the W.S.W. in a long\r\nstring of groups of ships stretching from north to south. The allies\r\nwere lying in a concave line also stretching from north to south. They\r\nturned to bring their heads on Cadiz. Their advance squadron, commanded\r\nby the Spanish admiral, Gravina, which had been to windward of the\r\nvan before the fleet turned, and was now the rear, was trying to fall\r\nin behind the centre, and formed the projecting southern point of the\r\ncrescent. They were not in exact order, for some were to leeward of\r\nothers, so that the whole seemed to form two lines. Beginning from the\r\nnorth they lay thus:—\r\n\r\n _Neptuno_                   80 Spanish   Capt. Don Cayetano Valdés.\r\n _Scipion_                   74 French     \"   C.

To the south they collected behind Collingwood.\r\nThe enemy looked in vain for a time when each should form something\r\nlike a line. As the whole approached the curve where the allies were\r\nforging slowly ahead, ready to show at least the passive and defensive\r\ncourage of brave men who had not the skill to display active valour,\r\nCollingwood ordered his squadron to form the leeward line of bearing.\r\nIf the order could have been executed it would have brought all the\r\nships of his division into a line on his starboard side deflected from\r\nhim at an angle and stretching from N.N.E. to S.S.W. Then his ships\r\nwould infallibly have come into action in such a way that the most\r\nsoutherly of them would have struck on the projecting southern point\r\nof the allied crescent, before the most northern reached her point\r\nof attack near the centre. But the order cannot have been intended\r\nto produce exact obedience, Collingwood even made exact obedience\r\nimpossible. The =Royal Sovereign=, his flagship, at the northern end\r\nof his line, a clean swift-sailing ship, curved all sail and swept\r\non ahead. Nobody stopped for the heavy sailers. The signal was meant\r\nto tell the captains to advance along lines parallel to the course\r\nof the flagship as well and as fast as they could, and between her\r\nand the rear of the enemy. They did advance in a string, the quick\r\nsailers close to the =Royal Sovereign=, and the tubs struggling in the\r\nrear. The =Defence= was two hours later in getting into action than\r\nthe =Royal Sovereign=, a clear proof that she never was even nearly\r\non the larboard line of bearing. Nelson, for his part, did less than\r\nCollingwood to satisfy any expectation the enemy may have entertained\r\nof seeing a line formed. Captain Blackwood of the =Euryalus=, the\r\nfrigate which had rendered excellent service in watching the allies,\r\nhas left a memorable picture of the admiral’s bearing and conduct on\r\nthis last morning of his life. Blackwood was summoned early to the\r\nflagship, and came in the hope of hearing that Nelson had decided to\r\ngive him the command of the =Ajax= or the =Thunderer=, then in charge\r\nof lieutenants, because their captains had gone to England to attend\r\na court-martial on Sir R. Calder. He was mistaken. Nelson had called\r\nhim to act as witness to the codicil to his will he had just written,\r\nwherein he left to the nation the legacy he perhaps ought not to have\r\nleft, but which ought not to have been refused. Then the admiral wished\r\nto make his wishes clear, and to pour his heart out with all the\r\nfreedom of his expansive nature among friends, now when the approach\r\nof peril and of the decisive hour were producing the exhilaration they\r\nnever failed to arouse in his soul of flame. Blackwood, speaking for\r\nhimself and for all the officers, urged Nelson to allow other vessels\r\nto pass ahead of the =Victory= to meet the first shock, and leave him\r\nfree to direct the general movements of his fleet. He consented. He\r\neven allowed Captain Blackwood to row to the =Leviathan= with a message\r\nto Captain Harvey to take the head of the line. But when Blackwood\r\nreturned he found that nothing had been done to render obedience\r\npossible. The =Victory= was still carrying on. She was headed at the\r\nenemy’s van and then at his centre. Her swaying course added to the\r\nconfusion prevailing among the ships behind her. But it kept the enemy\r\nin doubt as to the exact point on which the attack would fall. At\r\n11.40 Nelson signalled that he meant to pass through the enemy’s line\r\nand bar the road of retreat to Cadiz. A quarter of an hour later he\r\nsent up the famous signal which, as some authorities tell us, was to\r\nhave been, “_Nelson_ expects that every man will do his duty.” If I\r\nmay be permitted to express a personal preference, I wish it had been.\r\nThat England expects every man to do his duty is at best a copy-book\r\nheading, and we cannot quite forget that she stands in expectation\r\nwith the articles of war in hand, and death or other punishment\r\ndenounced against all who fail. The personal appeal of Nelson, who\r\nof all admirals did most by his personal influence, would have been\r\nappropriate and heroic. When the weather division was all but touching\r\nthe enemy’s line, Nelson sent Blackwood and his brother-captain, Prowse\r\nof the =Sirius=, back to their ships. He told Blackwood to hail the\r\ncaptains of the ships behind the =Victory=, and tell them to break in\r\non the enemy where they could, standing not upon the order of their\r\ngoing—and parted from him with the prophecy that they were not to meet\r\nagain, for he did not believe that he would survive the battle.\r\n\r\nIt was a little before noon of the 21st October that England began\r\nto reap the reward of generations of wise effort honestly made,\r\nwhile France and Spain began to pay for unwisdom and neglect of long\r\nstanding. The famous plan of battle was comparatively a small matter, a\r\nclever device which a clever enemy could have baffled, or at the best\r\na more effectual way of doing what Howe had done on the 1st June—of\r\nproducing a mêlée in which the better quality of the English fleet\r\nwould have full play. The chief gave that superiority entire freedom.\r\nIn his memorandum he had frankly told his officers that unforeseen\r\nconditions might make it impossible to carry out his plan exactly as\r\nhe designed it, but that no captain could be wrong who laid his ship\r\nalongside an enemy. And the men knew their superiority—not in valour,\r\nthe quality which is indispensable to a good force, but will not itself\r\nmake a good fighting force. The valour and intellectual alertness of\r\nthe French had never left themselves without witness in their fleets.\r\nThe Spaniards, less active and intelligent than the French, could at\r\ntheir best fight the batteries of their ships with the same sort of\r\ncourage they showed in defending Saragossa or Gerona. The superiority\r\nlay in the power to strike quick and hard, to repair damage, to use\r\ntheir weapons.\r\n\r\nIn the little wind there was the English came on at the rate of about\r\na mile and a quarter an hour. The effective range of fire of the guns\r\nof the time was from a thousand to twelve hundred yards. Therefore, as\r\nour leading ships came on they were under fire for half an hour or so\r\nbefore reaching the line. Until they were within four to five hundred\r\nyards they would be liable to the concentrated fire of two or more of\r\nthe enemy, while as they approached the enemy’s line, through which\r\nthey meant to steer, the danger of a raking broadside increased with\r\ntheir proximity. If the fire of the allies had been what the fire of\r\nthe well-drilled English ships was, two broadsides in five minutes\r\n(some could fire three), the leading ships of both divisions must have\r\nundergone ten or twelve broadsides before they were in a position to\r\nreply. If the aim of the enemy had been good they would have been torn\r\nto shreds. The =Royal Sovereign=, the first to cut the line, passed\r\nastern of the _Santa Ana_, raking her with great effect, and ahead of\r\nthe _Fougueux_. She ranged up on the starboard side of the Spaniard,\r\nwho made but a feeble reply, but she was fired into by the _Fougueux_,\r\nthe _Monarca_, and the _Indomptable_. The time seemed long to her\r\nofficers and men before relief came. But in some ten minutes, the\r\n=Belleisle=, which had been left three-quarters of a mile behind the\r\n=Royal Sovereign= broke in astern of the _Fougueux_ and took off part\r\nof the fire. A few minutes later help came from the weather division.\r\nThe =Royal Sovereign= was relieved of most of her assailants, and was\r\nleft to fight it out with _Santa Ana_ whose side she fairly battered\r\nin. In the course of the battle she was rendered unmanageable, and she\r\nlost 141 killed and wounded. But she was not shattered beyond repair,\r\nand her loss was four less than the loss of the =Ardent=, 64, out\r\nof a far smaller crew at Camperdown.[8] As much may be said of all\r\nthe vessels which lost heavily, the =Victory=, the =Téméraire=, the\r\n=Belleisle=, =Mars=, =Tonnant=, =Bellerophon=, =Colossus=. They came\r\nin early against fresh opponents, they were engaged with several at\r\nonce, they were roughly handled; but in such conditions and against\r\nequal skill they would have been destroyed. The most striking proof of\r\nthe poor gunnery of our opponents is afforded by the fortunes of the\r\n=Africa=, 64. She was separated, and to the north, before the battle\r\nbegan. She joined Nelson’s division by passing in front of the enemy’s\r\nvan within range, and she took part in the hottest fighting at the\r\ncentre. Yet her loss was only sixty-two, less than half the loss of the\r\n=Ardent= at Camperdown.\r\n\r\nThe =Royal Sovereign= had broken the enemy’s line astern of the _Santa\r\nAna_ a little before twelve. There were sixteen French and Spaniards\r\nof the line between her and the last ship in the curved formation of\r\nthe allies to be dealt with by Collingwood’s fifteen. The =Victory=,\r\nwith the =Neptune= on the port and the =Téméraire= on the starboard\r\nside, broke in two ships ahead of the _Santa Ana_. The =Victory= passed\r\nastern of the _Redoutable_, the =Neptune= ahead of her and astern of\r\nthe _Bucentaure_, the =Téméraire= attacked the Spanish _San Justo_\r\nastern and to leeward of the _Redoutable_. Thus a concentration was\r\neffected on the enemy’s centre as the ships of the weather division\r\ncame up. The allies astern of the _Santa Ana_ moved ahead to help\r\nfriends, or because the wind carried them slowly on. The ships of the\r\nEnglish lee division broke in among them, or, in the case of the heavy\r\nsailers who came in late, swept round the end of the line. There was\r\nhere no concentration of superior numbers by us, but a development of\r\nsuperior power of gunnery which shattered the enemies within reach and\r\nbroke the whole, so that the last comers of the English finished the\r\naction with little loss to themselves, and indeed, in the case of the\r\n=Prince=, with no loss at all. When the weather division fell on the\r\ngroup of the allies about the _Bucentaure_ it stopped their way. The\r\nten ships ahead of the central group stood on leaving a break between\r\nthemselves and the hard-pressed centre. In vain did Villeneuve hoist\r\nsignals to bring them into the action, so long as he had a mast to\r\nhoist signals on. Dumanoir signalled that he had no enemy to engage,\r\nand he behaved as if he had no wish to find one. He could bring his\r\nship’s head round with the help of their boats, and could find wind to\r\ntake a sweep out to the west, and run away with all who would follow\r\nhim at the close of the battle. All did not. Some of the ten came\r\nvoluntarily into action comparatively early, turning back manfully\r\nto help their friends. Two refused to follow Dumanoir at the end—Don\r\nCayetano Valdés of the _Neptuno_, and Captain Infernet of the French\r\n_Intrépide_ were found faithful and struck for honour, when they could\r\nno longer strike for victory. But the chivalry which does not recognise\r\nthat the feeble bearing of Dumanoir-le-Pelley was no small aid to our\r\nsuccess, is a chivalry which has forgotten that a regard for truth is\r\none of the qualities of a knight and a gentleman.\r\n\r\nEvery child in the English-speaking world knows how the death\r\nwhich Nelson saw coming to him struck him down on the =Victory’s=\r\nquarter-deck, and how he died in her cockpit—thanking God that he\r\nhad done his duty. He had also done his work. He had so directed\r\nthe long acquired superiority of the English fleet that it could act\r\nuntrammelled by pedantry and could despise vain shows. It had exercised\r\nits whole strength and had swept hostile fleets off the sea. When the\r\nbattle of Trafalgar ended at five o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st\r\nOctober, the epoch of battles at sea was over for long years. There\r\nwas plenty of work for the navy to do. There were no more battles\r\nto fight. Of the thirty-three ships of the allied line, four—the\r\n_Formidable_, _Mont Blanc_, _Scipion_, and _Duguay-Trouin_—escaped\r\nseaward and steered for France, only to be captured off Cape Ortegal by\r\nfive English ships of the line under Sir Richard Strachan: the =Cæsar=,\r\n80, Strachan’s own ship; the =Hero=, 74, Captain Alan Hyde Gardner;\r\nthe =Namur=, 74, Captain Halsted; the =Courageux=, 74, Captain Lee;\r\nand the =Bellona=, 74, Captain Pater. Observe that in this action,\r\nwhere no English ship was isolated amid several opponents, we lost 24\r\nkilled and 111 wounded in all. The loss of the enemy was 730. Eleven\r\nships escaped into Cadiz, where the French among them remained till\r\nthey were taken by the Spaniards in 1808. Eighteen were taken, one of\r\nthem, the French _Achille_, caught fire and was destroyed. Four—one\r\nFrench and three Spanish—remained as prizes in our hands. The others\r\nwere wrecked, destroyed by us, or recaptured in the storm following the\r\nbattle. Nelson had decided to anchor. Collingwood, to whom the command\r\nfell, elected not to do so. Perhaps he thought that the most seriously\r\ninjured vessels could not anchor, and that the less injured must keep\r\nunder way to help them. It was a question of seamanship, and of that\r\nart he was a master. Our total loss was 1690. The loss of the allies\r\ncannot be accurately fixed, but it was very much greater. Villeneuve,\r\nwho fought his flagship bravely, remained a prisoner till he was\r\nreleased on parole, and killed himself in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE COMMAND OF THE SEA\r\n\r\n AUTHORITIES.—In addition to the books named above, the reader\r\n     may consult the earlier letters of Sir Charles Napier in the\r\n     collection named _The Navy, its Past and Present_; _The Past\r\n     and Future of the British Navy_, by the Hon. G. Plunkett (Lord\r\n     Dunsany); _Impressment Fully Considered_, by Captain A. J.\r\n     Griffiths; Captain Mahan’s _War of 1812_; Captain Robinson’s\r\n     _British Tar_ and _Nelson’s Signals_, published by the\r\n     Admiralty, and written by Mr. Perrin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phrase “The Command of the Sea” may be so used as to be rhetorical\r\nand misleading. It is so used when it is meant to assert or imply that\r\nthe power exercising the command can exclude an opponent from access to\r\nthe sea, or can be secured against all loss and defeat on the water.\r\nIf “command” means solitary possession, then it was never enjoyed\r\nby England throughout the whole of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic\r\nwars. Her navy suffered more small defeats, and her trade was more\r\nharassed in 1813 than in any year of the war. In 1810, six years after\r\nTrafalgar, three French frigates sailed to the Indian Ocean. Two of\r\nthem were lost in action, but the third, the _Clorinde_, made her way\r\nhome, and, though she was chased by a line-of-battle ship, got safe\r\ninto Brest. In that year four English frigates were destroyed at a blow\r\nat Grand Port in Mauritius. When “command” is used with exaggeration\r\nit has not much more meaning than the figurative expression which\r\nspeaks of the ocean as covered by the sails of a naval power. There\r\nhave been men who took these words as intended to state a fact. General\r\nLauriston, who accompanied Villeneuve to the West Indies, says in one\r\nof his letters that they had all heard of the English ships as covering\r\nthe ocean, and yet they had only seen two at anchor in the Antilles.\r\nIf, however, we are content to employ the words as meaning the power\r\nto send fleets to and fro, to conduct trade, to effect conquests, and\r\ncarry on wars oversea—then England had the command from the beginning,\r\nand had it because she fought an enemy crippled by revolutionary\r\nanarchy. The use she made of her superiority was often governed by\r\nconsiderations wholly unconnected with the strength of the navy. If she\r\ndid not conquer Java till 1811 it was not for want of naval strength.\r\nIt was because a large army could not be sent from India while Mysore\r\nwas unconquered and the Mahrattas were not subdued. But if we are to\r\ndiscuss all these aspects of a multiform war, a short history of the\r\nRoyal Navy would be lost in a long history of more than twenty years\r\nof warfare on land, of diplomacy, and of finance. We must be content\r\nto keep to the forces with which England exercised the command of the\r\nsea, the purposes for which she used them, and the methods which she\r\nemployed. The forces were the material strength and quality of the\r\nnavy. Her purposes were the protection of trade, and the prosecution\r\nof wars over sea. The methods were, first, the destruction of the\r\nenemies’ main fleets, which I have already endeavoured to deal with,\r\nand then blockades, patrol by vessels cruising on the ocean routes, the\r\ntransport of, and co-operation with, the armies.\r\n\r\n +------+---------+-------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------+\r\n |      |Sea-going|Harbour|   In    |Harbour, |         |         |        |\r\n |      | Ships.  | Ships,|Ordinary.|   in    |Building.|Officers.|   Men. |\r\n |      |         |  etc. |         |Ordinary.|         |         |        |\r\n +------+---------+-------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------+\r\n |      |         |       |         |         |         |         |        |\r\n | 1794 |   279   |   32  |   49    |    60   |    37   |   2207  |  85,000|\r\n | 1795 |   326   |   69  |   37    |    51   |    27   |   2727  | 100,000|\r\n | 1796 |   376   |   70  |   29    |    59   |    58   |   3094  | 110,000|\r\n | 1797 |   401   |   80  |   34    |    72   |    46   |   3351  | 120,000|\r\n | 1798 |   451   |   85  |   51    |    73   |    36   |   3482  | 120,000|\r\n | 1799 |   469   |  115  |   48    |    62   |    28   |   3744  | 120,000|\r\n | 1800 |   468   |  131  |   42    |    88   |    28   |   3658  | 120,000|\r\n | 1801 |   472   |  134  |   39    |    90   |    36   |   3693  | 120,000|\r\n | 1802 |   451   |  128  |   54    |   113   |    35   |   3950  | 130,000|\r\n | 1803 |   232   |   10  |  210    |   156   |    55   |   4220  |  50,000|\r\n | 1804 |   395   |   45  |   79    |   103   |    80   |   4203  | 100,000|\r\n | 1805 |   508   |   45  |   69    |   104   |    81   |   4228  | 120,000|\r\n | 1806 |   579   |   55  |   46    |   108   |   131   |   4172  | 120,000|\r\n | 1807 |   636   |   58  |   54    |   117   |   108   |   4511  | 120,000|\r\n | 1808 |   642   |   53  |   59    |   167   |   111   |   4823  | 130,000|\r\n | 1809 |   709   |   64  |   46    |   160   |    82   |   4955  | 130,000|\r\n | 1810 |   692   |   72  |   37    |   175   |    72   |   5118  | 145,000|\r\n | 1811 |   658   |   69  |   38    |   195   |    59   |   5107  | 145,000|\r\n | 1812 |   621   |   71  |   40    |   166   |    80   |   5260  | 145,000|\r\n | 1813 |   613   |   72  |   40    |   174   |   110   |   5502  | 140,000|\r\n | 1814 |   644   |   69  |   43    |   180   |    72   |   5594  | 140,000|\r\n | 1815 |   485   |   35  |  115    |   206   |    43   |   5682  |  70,000|\r\n |      |         |       |         |         |         |         |        |\r\n +------+---------+-------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------+\r\n\r\nWhen the war began in 1793 the Royal Navy had in commission for\r\nsea-service:—26 ships of the line from 60 guns and upwards, 7 of 50,\r\nand 3 of 44 guns, and 199 vessels, from 38-gun frigates down to the\r\ncutter of 4 guns. In commission for harbour duty were 3 ships of the\r\nline and 11 of other classes. She had 169 vessels, including 87 of\r\nthe line, 5 of 50 and 15 of 44 guns; “in ordinary,” that is to say,\r\nnot in commission but fit, when repaired, for active service; 72, of\r\nwhich 25 were of the line, 7 were of 50, and 3 of 44 guns, only fit for\r\nharbour duty but not in commission; 21, of which 12 were of the line,\r\nwere building or ordered to be built—in all, 411 vessels. The officers\r\non the active list were 2378 in number, and 45,000 men were voted by\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the navy at the beginning of the succeeding years of\r\nthe war was as given in the table on the preceding page.\r\n\r\nIn 1800, 120,000 men were voted for the first two months of the year,\r\nand 110,000 for the rest of the year. In 1801, 120,000 were voted for\r\nthe first three months, and 135,000 for the rest of the year. In 1802,\r\nthe year of the peace, 130,000, 88,000, and 70,000 were successively\r\nvoted. In 1803, the year of the renewal of the war, the votes were\r\nfor 50,000, 60,000, 100,000 men successively. In 1807 the numbers\r\nwere 120,000 for the first month, and then 135,000. In 1814 they were\r\n140,000 for seven, and 90,000 for six months. The vote was by the month\r\nof twenty-eight days and thirteen to the year.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars the use of the carronade\r\nin the navy was considerably extended. This piece, invented by General\r\nMelville, and first cast in the Carron foundry in Scotland, was\r\nintroduced into the navy in 1779. It was a short piece with a large\r\nbore, and a powder chamber, light, easily handled and destructive to\r\ntimber when fired at short range. The shot was large in proportion to\r\nthe size of the piece, and because of its destructive effect on wood\r\nit was to have been named the “Smasher.” At first the carronades were\r\nonly placed where there was no room for long guns. But its effect\r\nat close quarters proved so tempting that in some cases the long\r\nguns were replaced by carronades. In 1782 the =Rainbow=, 44, was so\r\nrearmed. The change made in the weight of her broadside added—or\r\nseemed to add—immensely to her strength. Her forty-four long guns\r\ngave a broadside weight of 318 lbs. The forty-eight carronades she\r\nreceived in lieu of long guns, gave her a broadside of 1238 lbs. The\r\n=Rainbow= made an easy capture of a beautiful French frigate, the\r\n_Hébé_. But then she was able to come close to the French ship before\r\nopening fire. When this advantage could not be secured the carronade\r\nwas of no value, for it had only a short range. Its weakness was fully\r\ndemonstrated in the action between the =Phœbe= and the American frigate\r\n_Essex_. The American ship was armed with carronades on her gun deck.\r\nThe =Phœbe= was to windward, and her captain, Hillyar, who knew the\r\ninferiority of his opponent’s armament, kept his distance, and battered\r\nthe American into ruin. As the carronade was never counted officially\r\nin the armament of a ship, its introduction led to confusion, and some\r\ndishonesty in estimating the strength of our ships and our enemies.\r\nWe counted all the pieces of ordnance of our opponent but only our\r\nown “guns.” The carronade was adopted by foreign navies after 1783.\r\nDuring the wars which began in 1793 the navy had the benefit of a\r\nmuch improved system of signalling. The old system was one by which\r\nparticular combinations of flags, or the place of flags in the rigging,\r\nconveyed a certain order. The new or numerary system was elaborated by\r\nLord Howe in combination with Kempenfelt, and was largely developed by\r\nSir Home Popham.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this list that the navy attained to its maximum of\r\nnumbers of ship’s officers and men in the years following Trafalgar.\r\nThe increase was most marked after 1808, the year of the beginning of\r\nthe war in Spain, and the largest numbers were reached from 1810 to\r\n1814. There is a very general agreement among the best authority that\r\nthe augmented size of the fleet was not accompanied by a growth in\r\nreal power. It is maintained that, on the contrary, the efficiency of\r\nthe fleet fell off. Its gunnery was neglected for mere “polish,” and\r\nthe crews deteriorated in quality. Many explanations of the decline\r\nhave been given. The disappearance of French fleets from the sea is\r\nsaid to have rendered our officers somewhat careless of their gunnery.\r\nThe unwillingness of the Admiralty to authorise expenditure of powder\r\nin practice has been rendered responsible for the decline of skill.\r\nThe hardships of life in the navy aggravated by the brutality of some\r\nofficers are held to have deterred men from entering the service, and\r\nto have made them eager to desert when they were in it. The large\r\nproportion of foreigners employed is given as another cause of the loss\r\nof efficiency. There are elements of truth in all this criticism and\r\napology. When seven hundred vessels more or less were in commission,\r\nonly a small minority had an opportunity to see service. Some officers\r\nof known zeal and capacity passed years without once being under fire.\r\nIf the heart of a captain was intent on seamanship and smartness he\r\nmight be tempted, by the small chance of meeting a foe, to neglect the\r\ngun drill of his crew. If he feared to be blamed by the Admiralty for\r\nexpending too much powder, he would not venture to avail himself of the\r\ndevice employed by some of his colleagues, who obtained practice for\r\ntheir men by pretending to see suspicious strangers, and who did not\r\nhesitate to make fictitious entries in their logs. After the loss of\r\nseveral English vessels, captured in rapid succession by the Americans\r\nin the war of 1812, the decline of our gunnery became a commonplace. So\r\ndid the cruelty of certain captains of “crack” ships, who sacrificed\r\neverything, including humanity, to “overpolish.” We hear of crews\r\ndriven to mutinous explosions by officers who would send their men\r\naloft ten or twelve times to finish off some mere detail of the set\r\nor stowing of sails. Such men enforced attention to their pedantry\r\nand foppery by the lash. Mere declamation can be neglected, but we\r\ncannot reject the testimony of Codrington given in the very midst of\r\nthe American war, in a private letter written from the station, and\r\nsupported by examples. “I have heard,” he said, “many shocking stories\r\nof cruelty and misconduct witnessed by the relators, officers now in\r\nthis ship.” If there is any truth in the statement that the number of\r\nfloggings inflicted in English ships diminished by a half when the\r\nAdmiralty ordered quarterly returns of punishments to be made, it is\r\nmanifest that there must have been a gross abuse of the power to flog.\r\nIt is certain that we employed many foreigners, and one of the English\r\nvessels lost in the war of 1812, the =Epervier=, had foreigners in her\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nYet it is doubtful whether these explanations of the decline of\r\nour discipline and skill are satisfactory. No vessel lost to the\r\nAmericans was so scandalously lost as the =Ambuscade=, taken by the\r\nFrench _Bayonnaise_ in 1798. She was outmanœuvred by a smaller ship,\r\nand carried by boarding. In the American war the =Phœbe=, which took\r\nthe _Essex_ in the South Seas, and the =Shannon=, which took the\r\n_Chesapeake_, were nowise inferior to their opponents in gunnery. Nor\r\nwere we always beaten in that war by gunnery or by American seamen.\r\nThe _Decatur_, which took the =Dominica= by boarding, was commanded by\r\na French privateer, Captain Diron, and manned by a French crew. The\r\ndiscipline of the navy was as severe for the marine as for other men.\r\nYet there never was any difficulty in recruiting for the marines. If\r\nour navy sank below the level of 1805, the reason must be sought in its\r\nsize. One hundred and forty-five thousand men was an immense number to\r\ntake from the population of Great Britain when it was less than half\r\nwhat it is to-day. And they had to be found just when increased numbers\r\nof soldiers were needed, when our merchant shipping had doubled, and\r\nwhen there was a great development of manufacturing industry and of\r\nagriculture. If we had been forced to rely on our own population we\r\ncould not have found the men. We succeeded because multitudes of\r\nforeign seamen were driven to seek service in England by the ruin of\r\ncommerce in their native countries. Even with their help the Admiralty\r\nwas unable to supply crews of good quality to all the ships. If the\r\n=Epervier= was largely manned by negroes and foreigners, she had many\r\nfeeble, undersized Englishmen who were taken because no better could be\r\nobtained. The physical strength of the men was a consideration of the\r\nfirst importance in the warships of the old navy. All the work at the\r\nguns had to be done by downright pulling and hauling. The proportion\r\nof one man to every 500 pounds of metal was just sufficient to work\r\nthe gun, and could not be maintained when the crew was short-handed,\r\nor when it was necessary to fight both broadsides. The effort required\r\nto run out a 32-pounder, which weighed 55 cwt. 2 lb. on the weather\r\nbroadside when the ship was leaning over, was severe even for a\r\nfull crew of twelve men. The demand for good men had far outrun the\r\nsupply. The existence of the United States added materially to our\r\ndifficulties, for it supplied our sailors with an English-speaking\r\ncountry to which they could escape. During the later stages of the\r\nwar the navy was compelled to form its crews with ever-increasing\r\ndifficulty. It found marines who, when they enlisted, had a security\r\nfor permanent employment and a pension. The sailors did not form a\r\npermanent corps and were sent adrift when their ship was paid off.\r\nThe regular bred seamen preferred the good wages and freedom of the\r\nmerchant service, or emigrated to America. The miscellaneous landsmen,\r\nwho formed a large part of our crews, were obtained by bounties and\r\nthe press. The press did indeed take time-expired apprentices from\r\nthe merchant ships at sea, and they constituted a valuable part of\r\nour crews. On land it was of little value. During 1811, 1812, and\r\n1813, 29,405 men were impressed, 27,300 of them deserted, and as 3000\r\ntrustworthy men were employed in the gangs which seized them, the navy\r\nwas in fact the loser to the amount of 1000 men. The naval rendezvous,\r\nplaced in “the vilest sort of public house, with a something that had\r\nonce been a Union Jack suspended from a pole, but from filth and dirt\r\nwearing the appearance of a black flag,” was not only a scandal, but a\r\nuseless expense. Pressgang midshipman was a byword for a ruffian. The\r\npractice of incorporating criminals and vagabonds in the navy, which\r\nwas as old as the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was continued throughout\r\nthe great war. Captain Anselm Griffiths, whose description of a naval\r\nrendezvous has been quoted above, is emphatic about the criminal\r\nelement in the navy. “What,” he says, “was the mass of discontent and\r\nimpatience generated by a forced association with the refuse of our\r\njails, convicts, vagabonds, thieves not brought to justice from lenity,\r\nsmugglers, White Boys, suspected Irish during the rebellion, all who\r\nfrom loss of character could not procure employment, the idle and the\r\nworthless,—all was fish that came to the net.”\r\n\r\nSuch accounts of the crews of the navy as this might be quoted in\r\nnumbers. We are tempted to wonder how the work was done with such men,\r\nand whether there can be any foundation for the praise given to the\r\nseamanship and gunnery of the navy. But Captain Griffiths, and other\r\nauthorities who support him, spoke of the bad elements. With them\r\nwere others of a very different order—the marines and the pressed men\r\nof good character. The great length of the war allowed time for the\r\nformation of a class of men who were trained wholly in the navy and\r\nwere attached to it by habit and affection. When Broke commissioned\r\nthe =Shannon=, he left England with a crew composed of drafts from the\r\nguardships of very mixed quality, and of a majority of boys provided\r\nby the Patriotic Society and the workhouses. If the =Shannon= had\r\nmet a well-appointed American frigate within three months she would\r\nhave fared no better than the =Epervier= or the =Java=. But she was\r\nsix years in commission before her famous action. Broke had time to\r\nweed out the bad characters. The boys grew to manhood under his wise\r\ntraining. The same process was going on in other ships. If we could\r\nhave limited the establishment of the navy to 80,000 or even 100,000\r\nmen, every ship might have been as well manned as the =Shannon=. It\r\nis even possible that the weaknesses of the navy were made to appear\r\ngreater than they really were by the fact that the Admiralty, which\r\nnaturally looked first to fleets Napoleon was building in European\r\nports, kept its best men for the European stations, and compelled\r\ncaptains, whose ships were commissioned for distant seas, to put up\r\nwith the worst. The increase in the staff of officers from over two to\r\nover five thousand, brought with it the necessity for not being too\r\nexacting as to their quality. Something must be allowed for the jobbery\r\nof the time. There were men in the navy who owed their positions to\r\nno merit of their own, but to the fact that some one of influence\r\nhad spoken for them. We must, again, allow for the fact that there\r\nwas as yet no uniform standard of discipline. The captains had wide\r\ndiscretion, and the bad ones were unchecked.\r\n\r\nWhatever evils the overgrowth of the navy brought with it, the increase\r\nwas unavoidable. In the years following Trafalgar, the English Navy\r\nwas in something not unlike the position of the French armies in Spain\r\nafter 1809. They were far more numerous than the army of Wellington\r\nin Portugal. Yet they were frequently unable to collect a force to\r\noppose him, because they were compelled to spread themselves over the\r\nwhole of Spain. We have recently learned how rapidly an army, which is\r\npowerful on a field of battle, can be frittered into small detachments\r\nwhen it has to guard long lines of communication, and to occupy a\r\nwide expanse of territory. The English Government was, from the year\r\n1793, under a peremptory obligation to guard trade routes extending\r\nfrom Canton to the St. Lawrence. The task did not become lighter after\r\nTrafalgar. Napoleon adopted a definite policy. He began to build line\r\nof battleships on a great scale. As his power spread he increased\r\ntheir numbers till he had upwards of one hundred and fifty in ports\r\nextending from Venice to Hamburg. They were rarely sent to sea. Many\r\nof them, built hastily of green timber, began to rot so soon as they\r\nwere launched. But it was impossible to neglect them. Squadrons must be\r\nemployed to watch them. The bulk of our navy was necessarily employed\r\nin that work. While our squadrons were watching hostile ports, our\r\ncommerce was subject to a double form of attack. Light squadrons and\r\nsingle ships sailed from French ports on commerce destroying cruises.\r\nPrivateers sailed not only from French ports, but from colonial\r\nharbours, Martinique and Guadaloupe, Bourbon and Mauritius, and the\r\nDutch islands of Java and Sumatra. These attacks had to be guarded\r\nagainst by blockade, by convoy, by patrol, and by the conquest of the\r\nports from which the privateers sailed.\r\n\r\nThe history of blockade cannot be told. It is a long monotonous roll\r\nof sailings from one point to another and back again, of periodical\r\nreturns to port to refit or for provisions, of ships driven away by\r\ngales from the land, or forced to work to sea that they might not be\r\ndriven on a lee shore. The daily fulfilment of a routine, isolation\r\nfrom family life and all society other than that of messmates, exposure\r\nto cold, to heat, to wet, make up the lot of the officers and men of a\r\nblockading fleet. And this was the work on which the majority of the\r\nnavy was employed. The brief intervals spent in a home port when food\r\nand water had to be renewed, were hardly less painful than the time\r\nspent on the cruising-ground, for the rule that neither officer nor man\r\nmight sleep on shore rendered the promise of more leave, given in 1797,\r\nalmost nugatory. Indeed an increase of pay was the most solid advantage\r\nthe seamen gained in that year. In 1808, when the need for more men\r\nbecame very urgent the pay of the sailor was raised to £1, 12s. for the\r\nlunar month. The secluded unnatural life of the blockading squadrons\r\nwas terrible for all ranks. Some of the consequences it produced cannot\r\nbe named. Not a few of the men went mad under the strain, multitudes\r\nwere hardened in heart and distorted in character.\r\n\r\nThe blockades did the work assigned them. When, in 1809, Napoleon\r\nendeavoured to send a strong squadron, drawn partly from the Brest\r\nfleet and partly from ships at Rochefort, to the West Indies, his\r\nplan was ruined by the Channel fleet. The bulk of his force did get\r\naway from Brest, but only to be sighted by the British forces and\r\ndriven into the Basque roads. There they were attacked by fireships\r\nunder the immediate command of Lord Cochrane (Dundonald) and the\r\nsuperior direction of Lord Gambier. The operation was not so completely\r\nsuccessful as it might have been. Cochrane was so dissatisfied by the\r\ninterference of his commander-in-chief that he forced the Admiralty to\r\nbring Gambier to a court martial. Even so, the attack ruined the French\r\nsquadron, and the reinforcements never reached the French islands. Here\r\nwe see the normal working of the blockade, which left the French fleet\r\nno chance of getting to sea, except by the help of good fortune in\r\nevading the watch of the British ships.\r\n\r\nNo great French fleet ventured to sea, and only once did a considerable\r\nFrench squadron incur the risk of trusting itself far from port among\r\nthe English forces. Napoleon would not hazard the great fleet he was\r\nbuilding up till he had vanquished all enemies on the Continent, and\r\ncould make a final attack with all the forces of Europe. But though\r\nthe main purpose was achieved the duty became continually more severe\r\ntill after the Russian campaign, when the destruction of the Grand\r\nArmy compelled the Emperor to take the crews of his ships and make\r\nregiments of them. As his power spread up to 1812, more and ever more\r\nports had to be watched, and it became constantly less possible to\r\nblock them all effectually. The vast works he carried out at Cherbourg\r\nmade the harbour capable of holding line-of-battle ships and imposed\r\nmore blockading duty on the navy. After the fall of Prussia in 1807 he\r\nbrought the coast of the Baltic under his control, and more ships were\r\nneeded to counteract his plans. The coast-line to be watched was so\r\nlong that though the English Government strained its resources to the\r\nutmost, though the navy was increased by desperate measures, it was\r\nimpossible to prevent cruisers and small squadrons from escaping to\r\nsea. In 1812 when 621 vessels were in commission, and the establishment\r\nof the navy was 145,000 men, Admiral Allemand sailed from Rochefort.\r\nHe eluded the blockading squadron. He almost succeeded in cutting off\r\nthe =Pompée=, 74, which was compelled to start eighty tons of water\r\nto lighten herself for flight. He cruised in the Atlantic for the\r\ndestruction of commerce, and, though he had little fortune in meeting\r\nEnglish trading vessels, he got safe back to Brest. Allemand’s raid\r\nshows that the new fleet Napoleon was forming was not so incapable of\r\nkeeping the sea as it has often been supposed to have been. An action\r\nfought in this same year must have been a warning to the English\r\nGovernment, if any were needed, that it dare not fail to maintain its\r\nnaval forces at the highest attainable level of strength. On the 21st\r\nFebruary the =Victorious=, 74, Captain Talbot, which was watching the\r\ngrowing Franco-Venetian squadron at Venice, fought an action with one\r\nof the vessels belonging to it, the _Rivoli_, 74, Captain Barré. The\r\n=Victorious= had been detached from the Toulon blockade, the _Rivoli_\r\nwas at sea for the first time, yet the action lasted for four hours,\r\nand though the _Rivoli_ was finally compelled to surrender, she\r\ninflicted a loss of 27 killed and 99 wounded on the =Victorious=.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1808, the year in which the great increase began,\r\nthe need for numbers had been even more effectually taught. English\r\ntroops were then engaged in somewhat fretful operations on the coast of\r\nCalabria. The French had recovered Corfu and held Venice. The calls on\r\nour fleet in the Mediterranean were many. Collingwood was co-operating\r\nwith the troops, in southern Italy, leaving frigates to watch Toulon.\r\nThe French Government decided to reinforce its squadron at Toulon\r\nby bringing round six ships—the _Majestueux_, 120, the _Ajax_,\r\n_Jemmappes_, _Lion_, _Magnanime_, and _Suffren_, 74’s, from Rochefort.\r\nThey were commanded by the same Admiral Allemand who was throughout\r\nhis career very successful in avoiding the many squadrons sent against\r\nhim. Rochefort was blockaded by Sir Richard Strachan with seven sail\r\nof the line. Sir Richard generally kept his squadron at anchor in the\r\nBasque Roads, but at the close of November 1807 he was compelled, by\r\nthe lack of provisions, to go to the rendezvous he had assigned to the\r\nvictuallers which were coming to join him—a point thirty miles or so\r\nsouth of Roche Bonne. A frigate and a brig were left to keep watch.\r\nNorth-easterly gales forced Strachan to the south. The victuallers did\r\nnot keep touch punctually. The work of transferring cargo at sea in\r\nrough weather was tedious. Allemand, seeing that he had only a frigate\r\nand a brig before him, put to sea on the 17th January and steered for\r\nthe Mediterranean. He had a good start, and as the wind turned to the\r\nwest and rose to a storm he got clear away with five of his ships. The\r\n_Majestueux_ was injured in the gale and compelled to return to Toulon.\r\nAllemand passed the Straits of Gibraltar and reached Toulon, unseen by\r\nany English cruiser, on the 6th February. Strachan, who was fighting\r\nhis way back to his station against the north-easterly wind when he\r\nheard of Allemand’s escape, followed him to the Mediterranean. But he\r\nwas embayed by the westerly gale. He did not pass the Straits till the\r\n10th, and he joined Thornborough, Collingwood’s second in command, at\r\nPalermo on the 21st. Ganteaume, who commanded at Toulon, put to sea\r\nwith Allemand’s ships on the 7th February, made his way round to Corfu\r\nto revictual the garrison, drove off the =Standard=, which he found\r\nthere, discharged his mission, and was safe back at Toulon by the 10th\r\nApril. Collingwood, who concentrated his ships and pursued him, failed\r\nto meet him. In the meantime, two French frigates, the _Pénélope_ and\r\n_Thémis_, which sailed from Bordeaux on the 21st January, had cruised\r\nnear Madeira, had destroyed English property to the value of a quarter\r\nof a million, had entered the Mediterranean, and had reached Toulon\r\nbefore the end of March. Criticism after the event could show that if\r\nthis or the other officer had done something he did not do, Allemand,\r\nGanteaume, and the frigates would have been cut short somewhere. But\r\nthe palpable fact was that our forces had not prevented the cruises\r\nof the Frenchmen. When Strachan followed Allemand he necessarily left\r\nRochefort free for the privateers to enter or leave. With all our\r\nsuperiority over the French fleets we still could not have too many\r\nmen, too many ships, and an increase was not to be avoided, be the\r\nevils it entailed what they might.\r\n\r\nThe blockading fleets composed the screen covering all the other\r\noperations of our ships. They were not able to protect completely,\r\nbut without such protection as they did afford other duties could not\r\nhave been performed. The most exacting and most constant of these\r\nwas convoy. The whole British Navy was engaged in the protection of\r\ntrade, but the task was peculiarly imposed on the ships which sailed\r\nwith the fleets of merchant vessels. It had always been counted one of\r\nthe most pressing of an admiral’s duties to protect “the trade.” Hood\r\ntook a crowd of merchant crafts with him when he sailed to reinforce\r\nRodney in the West Indies in 1780. Rodney brought the trade with him\r\nwhen he returned home in ill-health. Howe was called upon to see a\r\nhundred trading ships well clear of the Channel when he sailed in\r\n1794. But after that year the main fleets were relieved of the duty.\r\nThey were left free to pursue the enemy’s fleets, and the protection\r\nof the traders against privateers, and single man-of-war cruisers was\r\nleft to detachments. It was a tedious and thankless duty. The rate of\r\nsailing of the merchant ships was very slow. The need for vigilance was\r\nunceasing, and peculiarly great, while just leaving or approaching the\r\nland, for it was then that the prowling privateer was most active. As\r\nthe trading fleet neared its destination the skippers were tempted to\r\npush ahead to reach their market first, and they frequently fell into\r\nthe hands of the hostile commerce destroyers. The naval officers, who\r\nwere liable to be accused of neglecting their duty by the owners of the\r\ncaptured ships, had long complained of their inability to control the\r\nmerchant skippers. When the war was renewed in 1803 the Government took\r\nmeasures to reduce the loss inflicted on our shipping to the lowest\r\nattainable level, by compelling all vessels not specially exempted\r\nto sail in convoy. It passed “An Act for the better Protection of\r\nthe Trade of the United Kingdom during the present Hostilities with\r\nFrance” (anno 43^d Geo. III. cap. 57). By this Act merchant ships were\r\nrequired to sail in convoys, to obey the naval officer commanding,\r\nand not to separate wilfully under a penalty of £1000, if the cargo\r\nbelonged to a private owner, and of £1500 if it was composed of naval\r\nor military stores. If a vessel did leave the convoy, and was captured,\r\nthe owner forfeited all right to recover his insurances. Vessels might\r\nbe licensed to sail without convoy, and the vessels of the East India\r\nCompany, and of the Hudson’s Bay Company were expressly exempted.\r\n\r\nAn event which occurred on the 14th and 15th February 1804 would seem\r\nto indicate that the East India Company could well dispense with\r\nconvoy. The French admiral, Linois, the victor of Algeciras, had been\r\nsent to the east with General Decaen. He obtained early news of the\r\noutbreak of hostilities when at or near Pondicherry and went off at\r\nonce to Java in such a hurry, that he did not wait for an English naval\r\nofficer whom he had invited to breakfast. On his way he captured a\r\nnumber of valuable English ships, and then he sailed from Batavia to\r\nintercept the Company’s vessels on their way from Canton to Europe.\r\nThis very valuable trading fleet consisted of sixteen vessels of the\r\nnominal burden of 1200 tons, but a real tonnage of from 1300 to 1500.\r\nThey were armed with from 30 to 36 guns, and carried crews of 60 white\r\nseamen, and 120 Lascars. Their guns were as a rule of no great value,\r\nand in real force they were far inferior not only to a frigate but to\r\na heavy corvette. Linois had with him the _Marengo_, 74, the _Belle\r\nPoule_, 40-gun frigate, the _Semillante_, 36, the _Berceau_, 22, and\r\nthe _Aventurier_, 16. On the 14th February he sighted the Company’s\r\nships to the E.N.E. of Pulo Aor, an island near the east side of the\r\nsouthern extremity of the Malay Peninsula. They were on their way to\r\nthe Straits of Malacca—sixteen of them in all—the =Earl Camden=, the\r\nship of the Company’s commodore, Nathaniel Dance; the =Warley=, Henry\r\nWilson; =Alfred=, James Farquharson; =Royal George=, John Fam Timmins;\r\n=Coutts=, Robert Torin; =Wexford=, W. Stanley Clarke; =Ganges=,\r\nWilliam Moffat; =Exeter=, Henry Meriton; =Earl of Abergavenny=, John\r\nWordsworth; =Henry Addington=, John Kirkpatrick; =Bombay Castle=, Arch.\r\nHamilton; =Cumberland=, W. Ward Farrer; =Hope=, Jas. Prendergass;\r\n=Dorsetshire=, Rob. Hunter Brown; =Warren Hastings=, Thomas Larkins;\r\n=Ocean=, J. Christ. Lochner. The size of the 1200-ton ships, the fact\r\nthat they were painted to represent two tiers of guns, the craft of\r\nCommodore Dance, who hoisted the man-of-war pennant on three of them,\r\nand the bold bearing they all assumed, cowed Linois. He hesitated to\r\nattack till the Indiamen saw his hesitation, bore down on him and\r\ndrove him to flight. The Company’s skippers richly deserved all the\r\npraise and rewards they received. The knighthood given to Dance was\r\nhandsomely earned. Yet it would be a great mistake to conclude from the\r\naffair of Pulo Aor that the Company’s ships could rely on their own\r\nstrength. Linois was singularly disappointing to his friends whenever\r\nhe attempted to attack, though he could fight manfully with his back to\r\nthe wall. Indiamen did on several occasions make gallant and successful\r\nfights. On the other hand they were frequently taken by frigates and\r\nprivateers. When Sir E. Pellew came to take the command in the East\r\nIndies in 1804 the shipping had been well-nigh ruined in the Bay of\r\nBengal by French and Dutch privateers. It was only by submitting to\r\naccept convoy that the Company was able to revive its trade.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, limits to what the navy could do to protect trade\r\nby convoy. Vessels might be captured while on their way from their\r\nport of departure to the rendezvous. Gales might scatter them when\r\ncollected. Fog and mist might afford cover to the assailant. By far the\r\nmost effectual of all ways of protecting trade was to capture the ports\r\nfrom which the assailants sailed. Therefore from 1793 to 1811, when\r\nthe Dutch island of Java was taken, the navy was engaged in a series\r\nof colonial expeditions. They began with the seizure of St. Pierre\r\nand Miquelon, the two little islands belonging to France on the south\r\ncoast of Newfoundland, and of Pondicherry—three ports always occupied\r\nat the beginning of a war, and restored at the close. St. Pierre and\r\nMiquelon were taken in May, and Pondicherry was occupied August of\r\n1793. In the same year Tobago was taken from the French, and Martinique\r\nwas attacked without success. The royalists of the island called the\r\nEnglish forces in, but Rochambeau, the general in command, held his\r\nground. The planters of the French half of San Domingo also appealed\r\nto England for protection against their insurgent slaves. It was so\r\nfreely given that Jamaica was for a time left without a garrison. The\r\nspectacle of a triumphant servile revolt was dreadful to all the slave\r\nowners of the West Indies. The operations on the coast of this island\r\nwere disastrous to the troops. They dared not carry negroes with them\r\nfrom our own islands lest they should be infected in the rebellious\r\nspirit of the French slaves. No use could be made of the negroes of\r\nSan Domingo. Therefore the soldiers had to engage in work which is\r\nfatal to the white man in the tropics. Whole battalions were swept\r\naway by fevers. The part of the navy in this case and in most colonial\r\nexpeditions was to carry the troops, to land them, to supply naval\r\nbrigades. These services were necessarily unvarying in character. The\r\noccupation of a Dutch island in the Moluccas differs only in the names\r\nof the men and ships from the occupation of a French island in the West\r\nIndies. In these cases, too, the navy though an indispensable, was a\r\nsubordinate, part of the forces engaged. It carried the soldiers and\r\nit helped them, but the army effected the conquest. Nothing could well\r\nbe more idle than to speculate as to which of the two, the sailor or\r\nthe soldier, was the more essential to the victory. The soldiers could\r\nnot reach the place to be taken unless they were carried in ships,\r\nand the sailors could not occupy the land without the soldiers. To\r\nspeak of these conquests as the gift of the Sea Power is inaccurate if\r\nnot absurd. The Sea Power of itself could never have taken the Cape,\r\nor Mauritius. Many of them were not taken to be kept. The permanent\r\noccupation of Martinique or Guadaloupe would have been offensive to\r\nthe West Indian interest, since their produce would have competed\r\nwith that of our own islands in the home market. These islands were\r\ntaken primarily because they were the headquarters of the privateers\r\nwho preyed on our commerce, and secondarily because they were useful\r\npledges to have in hand when peace was to be arranged.\r\n\r\nA list of these expeditions given without monotonous detail will show\r\nby what steps England applied and completed her command of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn January 1794 Sir John Jervis arrived at Jamaica with four sail of\r\nthe line, escorting 7000 troops under the command of Sir C. Grey. They\r\nmade an easy conquest of Martinique, which had a garrison of only\r\n700 men in March, and in April occupied St. Lucia and Guadaloupe.\r\nIn June, Victor Hugues, by birth a mean white of the last-named\r\nisland, and a Jacobin of the most brutal character, but of energy\r\nand capacity, arrived from Europe with nine vessels, and troops. He\r\nlanded in Guadaloupe. An attack made on his ships at Pointe à Pitre\r\nby Jervis was repulsed. He drove the British garrison from pillar\r\nto post, and reconquered the island by December. Reinforcements\r\nreached him in September. Others sailed from Brest in November, and,\r\nthough attacked by English ships near Désirade, reached Guadaloupe in\r\nJanuary 1795. Hugues rapidly took or retook Santa Lucia, St. Vincent,\r\nGrenada, and Dominica. Our naval forces were not numerous enough to\r\nwatch everywhere. Nor were our troops, who were rapidly diminished by\r\ndisease, able to occupy in sufficient force.\r\n\r\nIn August of 1795 Rear-Admiral Keith Elphinstone (Lord Keith) landed\r\nthe troops which occupied the Cape. In July and August of the year the\r\nships on the East India station and troops from India occupied the\r\nDutch posts on the east side of Ceylon, in Molucca, and Cochin.\r\n\r\nIn April 1796 Rear-Admiral Christian came to take the command in the\r\nWest Indies in succession to Jervis, bringing troops under the command\r\nof Sir Ralph Abercromby. Santa Lucia was retaken at once, St. Vincent\r\nand Grenada in June. In the East Indies the Dutch posts at Colombo,\r\nAmboyna, Banda, etc., were occupied. In August a half-manned Dutch\r\nsquadron of three line-of-battle ships and four frigates fell into the\r\nhands of Keith at Saldanha Bay.\r\n\r\nIn February 1797 Spain having declared war, Rear-Admiral Harvey and\r\nAbercromby, with 5 sail of the line and troops, seized Trinidad. The\r\nSpanish admiral, Ruiz de Apodaca, whose ships were half-manned, burnt\r\nhis squadron, and the small garrison could offer no resistance. An\r\nattack on Porto Rico in April was beaten off.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 Surinam was occupied.\r\n\r\nIn September 1800 Curaçao was surrendered by the inhabitants, who\r\nwere terrorised by a mob of piratical adventurers calling themselves\r\nrepublicans.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, on the formation of the Northern Coalition, the Danish and\r\nSwedish islands in the West Indies, St. Martin, Saba, St. Thomas, St.\r\nJohn, Santa Cruz, St. Bartholomew, were occupied. The Dutch island,\r\nSt. Eustatius, was occupied. In the East Indies, Ternate was taken.\r\nPortugal having been driven by the threats of France and Spain to\r\nexclude other trade, we took possession of Madeira.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the Peace of Amiens, England made a wholesale\r\nrestoration of her conquests. Trinidad, which was of value as a depôt\r\nfor the smuggling trade with the Spanish colonies in South America, was\r\nretained. In the East we kept Ceylon. On the renewal of the war the\r\nwork of the previous years had to be done over again.\r\n\r\nIn 1803 the Dutch islands in the West Indies were reoccupied, and the\r\nnegroes of San Domingo were helped to destroy the remnants of the\r\nFrench troops among them.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, at the close of the year, an unsuccessful attack was made on\r\nCuraçao. Surinam was occupied in April and May.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 the Cape was reoccupied.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 Curaçao was taken at a rush by Captain Brisbane.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 Marigalante fell into our hands, but an attempt to seize St.\r\nMartin ended in the death or capture of all the men landed.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Senegal was taken for the express purpose of rooting out\r\nthe privateers who made it their headquarters. In the West Indies a\r\npowerful expedition, carrying 10,000 troops under General Beckwith,\r\nescorted by Admiral Cochrane, took Martinique. Cayenne was occupied by\r\na naval brigade, and our old enemy, Victor Hugues, the Governor, became\r\nour prisoner.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 Cochrane and Beckwith took Guadaloupe. In the East, Mauritius\r\nwas taken, and Amboyna and the Moluccas fell into our hands.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 the work was completed by the occupation of Java by a large\r\narmy from India.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese expeditions, which sailed to occupy islands from which attacks\r\ncould be made on our trade, were not the only tasks imposed on the navy\r\nin the interest of commerce. As Napoleon fixed his yoke on Europe, and\r\nendeavoured to compel all its peoples to join him in excluding English\r\ntrade, it became necessary to force an entry to new markets, and to\r\nfind the means of getting access to the old. It was in order to obtain\r\nfresh markets that the expeditions to the river Plate were undertaken\r\nin 1806 and 1807. Few passages in history are better fitted to show\r\nwhat is the rigid limit of the power of a fleet than these adventures.\r\nThe first was promoted by the admiral on the Cape Station, Sir Home\r\nPopham. He saw that new markets were becoming necessary, and he knew\r\nthat the Spanish colonists were discontented. From these sound premises\r\nhe drew the illegitimate deduction that the people of Buenos Ayres\r\nwould welcome English rule. He persuaded the authorities at the Cape\r\nto despatch troops to Buenos Ayres. The navy carried them there, but\r\nit could not save General Beresford and his men from being compelled\r\nto capitulate when the townsmen rose on them. The commercial classes\r\nin England forced the Government to continue the enterprise begun by\r\nSir Home. Monte Video was occupied, and Buenos Ayres was again attacked\r\nin 1807. But our troops, ill-commanded by General Whitelocke, were\r\nagain forced to surrender. England was on the verge of finding herself\r\ncommitted to a war of conquest in South America, which would have\r\nemployed her whole disposable army, when the rising of Spain against\r\nNapoleon in 1808 gave her an honourable excuse for withdrawing from a\r\ncompromising adventure.\r\n\r\nThe eager disposition of the trading classes in England to follow the\r\nlead given by Sir Home Popham, was immediately stimulated by Napoleon’s\r\nBerlin decree of the 27th October 1806. It was the beginning of a\r\nfurious rivalry between himself and the British Government, in which\r\neach endeavoured to prevent the other from obtaining any benefit from\r\nneutral trade. The emperor strove to exclude our commerce, and we to\r\nprevent any goods from reaching Europe except through English ports.\r\nThe neutral was ground between the upper and the nether millstone. The\r\nnavy was employed in covering a vast contraband trade, which arose\r\ninevitably from the natural desire of the inhabitants of Europe to\r\nobtain goods they needed, and England’s equally natural desire to\r\nsell. There was an element of hypocrisy on both sides, and in practice\r\neach undid much of its public policy by an underhand use of a licensed\r\ntrade. Napoleon undoubtedly employed this device to obtain the very\r\nthings he pretended to exclude. But he attempted to confine the right\r\nto disregard his decrees to himself. Therefore the smuggling trade\r\ncould not be dispensed with, and it became one of the duties of the\r\nnavy to shepherd the smugglers. The great field of this peculiar\r\ncommerce was the Baltic. The Peace of Tilsit, between France and\r\nRussia in July 1807, threatened England with a renewal of the Northern\r\nCoalition. Her Government, whether informed of the secret articles of\r\nthe treaty directed against it, or acting, as it was entitled to act,\r\non the certainty that the Emperor of the French would lay hands on any\r\nweapon he could reach to be used against England, took prompt measures\r\nto diminish the danger. In September it despatched a powerful combined\r\nexpedition to occupy Copenhagen and seize the Danish fleet. If this\r\nvigorous measure requires any justification, one can be found in the\r\nparoxysm of rage which it provoked in Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe seizure of the Danish fleet entailed a war with Denmark, and\r\nduring the ensuing years the navy had to fight many sharp actions in\r\norder to cover the merchant vessels on their way into and out of the\r\nBaltic. When in that sea the trading vessels were frequently compelled\r\nto cruise to and fro till they could co-operate with the smugglers on\r\nshore, or till the Governments found a way of admitting their goods\r\nout of sight of Napoleon’s agents. As Russia was compelled to make\r\nbelieve to go to war with England, and was very seriously engaged in\r\ndepriving the Swedes of Finland, a brush took place in August 1808. The\r\nEnglish fleet co-operated with the inefficient fleet of the Swedes, and\r\nescorted the 200 transports carrying English troops, under Sir John\r\nMoore, to their assistance. The Russian fleet would not be drawn into\r\na battle, but one of their liners, the _Sewolod_, 74, was cut off and\r\ntaken. The Russian crew showed solid courage, but their gunnery was not\r\nabove the Spanish level. The British fleets remained in the Baltic till\r\nthe downfall of Napoleon began. The service was trying, and the loss\r\nfrom shipwreck was at times severe. But the work was mainly political,\r\napart from the obligation to protect the traders from privateers\r\nsailing from ports under French control. Among the political duties\r\ndischarged was one which demonstrated the scope of the navy’s power.\r\nNapoleon had compelled the Spanish Government to supply him with a\r\nbody of troops for use in Germany—for he was as hard put to it to find\r\nmen for the vast armies his victories compelled him to maintain, as\r\nthe British Government was to keep up the establishment of its navy.\r\nHe had stationed the Spaniards in Denmark, and they were there when\r\ntheir country rose against the French in 1808. The British Government\r\nfound means to inform the Spanish general, Romana, of what had taken\r\nplace. He concentrated the greater part of his men, by forced marches\r\nin August, at Nyborg in Fünen, and embarked them on board an English\r\nsquadron commanded by Sir R. Keats. They were sent on to Spain.\r\n\r\nIt cannot well be said that the power of the navy was shown in the\r\ndischarge of another piece of political duty it had been called upon\r\nto perform at the other extremity of Europe from the Baltic. In 1806\r\nNapoleon was instigating the Turks to attack Russia, who was still in\r\narms against him. The English Government desired to help the enemy\r\nof our enemy, and Sir Thomas Duckworth was sent with a squadron to\r\ncoerce the Turks into keeping the peace. He forced the passage of\r\nthe Dardanelles in February 1807, and placed his squadron opposite\r\nConstantinople. But he unfortunately allowed himself to be played upon\r\nby the diplomacy of the Turks, and the French ambassador, General\r\nSebastiani. He delayed action till the Turks had thrown up batteries\r\nwhich made the position of his squadron dangerous, and he was compelled\r\nto retreat. On his return his squadron was roughly handled by the\r\nTurkish batteries.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the war in the Peninsula the navy was provided\r\nwith a field on which it could perform, profitably and with a definite\r\naim, duties which it had too often been called upon to discharge to\r\nno purpose. From the beginning of the war it had escorted troops to\r\nbe landed for conquest or co-operation with allies. Many of these\r\nundertakings were of the most futile character. If it took Abercromby\r\nto success in Egypt, it also took General Fraser to disaster. It\r\ncarried Sir John Moore to the fiasco of the Swedish expedition, and\r\nGeneral Stuart to that barren victory at Maida in Calabria, which\r\nwas followed by re-embarkation, and served no other purpose than to\r\naggravate the sufferings of the very people we came to help. After\r\nSir Sidney Smith covered the escape of the Portuguese royal family in\r\nNovember 1807 and escorted them to Brazil, the work of our army was to\r\nbe done on a great scale, nobly, and with triumphant results in Spain\r\nand Portugal. It would be pleasant to dwell on the incidents of the\r\nstory; on the feats of the =Impérieuse=, and the untiring activity of\r\nEnglish cruisers which intercepted the coast roads, and helped to keep\r\nthe war alive all along the coast of the Bay of Biscay. The navy helped\r\nto take coast forts, or defend them. It embarked the Spanish irregular\r\nbands when hard pressed, and disembarked them to begin again. It\r\ncontributed marines to hold the lines of Torres Vedras. It kept the sea\r\nroutes clear for the food and reinforcements sent to Wellington’s army.\r\nBut a service made up of scores of small actions cannot be shown by a\r\nfew examples, or told fully except at great length.\r\n\r\nThe same work was being done on a smaller scale on the coasts of\r\nSicily and Calabria, to guard the island against the attacks of the\r\ntwo successive French rulers in Naples—the emperor’s brother Joseph,\r\nand his brother-in-law Murat—and to keep resistance to them alive on\r\nthe mainland. When Napoleon had extorted Venice and Dalmatia from\r\nAustria, English ships entered the Adriatic to carry on there the work\r\nof blockade and harassment which others were doing elsewhere. But in\r\nthis sea the little war of skirmishes, single combats, and affairs in\r\nboats, was varied by an action too considerable and too significant to\r\nbe allowed to pass among minor operations.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th March 1811 a Franco-Venetian squadron of four heavy\r\nfrigates, two lighter frigates, and some small craft, commanded by\r\nCaptain Dubourdieu, attacked an English squadron of three frigates\r\nand a 22-gun corvette, under Captain Hoste, near Lissa. The French\r\nofficer was to windward, and he attacked in two divisions, a weather\r\nand a lee line, heading to cut through the English and surround the\r\nrear ships. If Hoste had been forced to remain passive with an awkward\r\nfleet, Dubourdieu would no doubt have succeeded. But a good breeze\r\nwas blowing, and the English squadron was thoroughly alert. Hoste\r\nclosed his line till the bowsprit of one ship was over the taffrail\r\nof the ship ahead of her, and he stood on. As he was moving ahead the\r\nFranco-Venetians were compelled to advance on slanting lines, and\r\nthe lee ships masked part of the weather line. Hoste knew that a sunk\r\nrock lay across his course. He stood on in hot action with the leader\r\nof the Franco-Venetian weather line and of the lee line, which came\r\nbehind, till he could not safely go any further. He then wore his\r\nline together. The leading Franco-Venetian ship, the =Favorite=, ran\r\non the rocks, and the others wore to escape her fate. Their division\r\ninto two lines became a cause of confusion. The single unhampered\r\nEnglish line cut them to pieces, and they were beaten with the loss\r\nof three frigates. Dubourdieu would have done better if he had formed\r\nhis squadron in a single line, had engaged the four English vessels\r\nto windward with four of his frigates, and had left the two others to\r\ndouble on one end of Hoste’s line. Even so he would probably have been\r\nbeaten. When the English had turned, two French vessels assailed the\r\n=Amphion=, Hoste’s frigate, which was now the rear ship of his line.\r\nBut the English officer shot from between them, and crossed the bows of\r\nthe vessel on his lee quarter. Superior mobility and quality more than\r\ncounterbalanced advantages of number and position or ingenuity of plan\r\nof attack.\r\n\r\nThis is the lesson which Lissa teaches, and which had been taught by\r\nevery encounter in the war, great or small. But patent as it was,\r\nEngland might have overlooked it but for a series of actions with a\r\nnew enemy which occurred at the close of the twenty-three years of\r\nwar. It is not my intention to depart from my rule of not describing\r\nsmall ship actions or operations on lakes. Therefore I do not tell in\r\ndetail the events of the war of 1812 with the United States. The single\r\nship actions and encounters between flotillas on the American lakes,\r\nof which it was composed, have been affectionately studied by the\r\npatriotism of a great people. To us they are, but for one consequence\r\nthey had, only minor events in a long and varied history. To describe\r\nhow the vast numerical superiority of the English navy enabled it in\r\nthe end to drive the American flag from the sea and to cover invasion\r\nof the territory of the United States, would be to tell a story which\r\nhas little intrinsic interest. The consequence of the early actions of\r\nthe war were, however, of extreme importance.\r\n\r\nThere was a serious risk that England would come to the end of the war\r\nin the complacent belief that she was endowed with a privilege to be\r\nsuperior on the sea. Her superiority was the fair reward of foresight\r\nand preparation. When looked at properly, her victories over the French\r\nand Spanish Navies afforded no guarantee that she would not be beaten\r\nif she forgot that:—\r\n\r\n    The same arts that did gain\r\n    A power must it maintain.\r\n\r\nThe rapid loss of a handful of vessels to a single opponent in the\r\ncourse of a few months drove that lesson home by a spasm of pain to\r\nour pride and self-confidence. The United States were not at that time\r\nable to maintain a great fleet. The rulers of the Republic very wisely\r\ndecided that since they could not possess many ships, they would take\r\ncare that such ships as they had should be of excellent quality and\r\nexcellently handled. They won the just reward of sound judgment and\r\ntimely preparation. Nor was that reward a slight one. The victories of\r\nthe United States frigates and sloops taught England that there was on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic a growing power which must one day be\r\nnumerous and wealthy, which would be able to maintain great fleets, and\r\nhad shown that her seamen could defeat all but the best of the English\r\nNavy. Idle attempts were made to belittle these successes by insisting\r\non the size and armament of the American frigates. The navy knew their\r\nsize and armament before it fought them. It learnt only from experience\r\nthat the Americans could make full use of these advantages, which they\r\nhad for the rest procured for themselves and not by accident. The good\r\nsense of the navy and the country would not be blinded. Englishmen\r\ndrew the very sane deduction that they could be beaten at sea if they\r\nallowed other people to surpass them in the quality of their armaments\r\nand in skill. Nothing is more striking than the sense of insecurity,\r\nthe doubts about the future, the painful consciousness that there was\r\nsomething misleading and hollow in all our naval successes, which can\r\nbe traced in the writings of seamen from the end of the great war. They\r\nall insist that we must not rest on our successes, but prepare for yet\r\nharder struggles in the future. A great work of reform and instruction\r\nbegan in the years immediately after the close of the war, and it\r\nbegan under the impulse given by the successes of the American ships.\r\nThe fortune of England has been wonderful, and it never served her\r\nbetter than when it gave her that warning. The Americans had beaten her\r\nbecause they were prepared and capable, and what the Americans had done\r\nothers could do if we allowed ourselves to be surpassed.\r\n\r\nThat what we needs must call fortune has had a great share in the\r\nvictories of England on the sea cannot be denied by any sound-minded\r\nman who looks at the history of her navy as a whole. Fortune, and not\r\nEngland, has provided that from the day when Hubert de Burgh and the\r\nmen of the Cinque Ports defeated Eustace the Monk, till the Treaty\r\nof Paris was signed in 1815, she has never had to meet an enemy at\r\nonce strong in numbers and good in quality on the sea, except during\r\nthe second half of the seventeenth century when she fought the Dutch.\r\nThey, a small people occupying a little corner of land, compelled to\r\nfight on shore for very existence, were necessarily surpassed. The\r\nSpaniard was always inept at sea. The French navy, the creation of\r\nLouis XIV., has been valiant, ingenious, not seldom successful, but it\r\nwas neglected, starved, misused by the monarchy, and so torn to pieces\r\nby the Revolution that it could never recover. The sound national\r\ninstinct, the healthy social order, the innate love of good work\r\nwhich have shaped our Navy, are just subjects for pride. But they are\r\nalso a lesson and a warning. Great navies are forming now, which have\r\nthoroughly learned all we have taught. We must not rely on possessing\r\nthe same superiority we had in the eighteenth century without strenuous\r\neffort. And we must not forget what that superiority was. It did not\r\nlie in numbers nor in armament, nor in methods of attack, however\r\nvaluable these elements of strength may be. It lay in that skill of\r\nthe men who handled the weapons, in that loyalty to the service, in\r\nthat readiness of resource, promptitude to decide, and firmness to act,\r\nwithout which, numbers, arms, and ingenious tactics are of no avail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] I have thought best to leave whatever it is needful to say about\r\nthe internal history of the British Navy in these years until it can\r\nfind a place in the account of the events of 1797.\r\n\r\n[2] I omit all mention of the mutinies in single ships which began to\r\noccur about this time, thinking it more convenient, and more likely to\r\ntend to clearness, to treat them along with the general outbreak of\r\n1797.\r\n\r\n[3] We may stop for a moment to look at this list of accidents.\r\nWhenever an accident happens to the navy to-day there is an outcry over\r\nthe decay of seamanship, and profuse assertions that such things did\r\nnot occur in the good old days are made. Yet we see that, when Bridport\r\nstarted on his tardy pursuit of Morard de Galle, two collisions and\r\none grounding took place in his fleet. Between the 10th December 1796\r\nand the 12th February 1797 there were six accidents, two of them total\r\nlosses in the fleet of Jervis—nine accidents in about eight weeks\r\namong the best forces we had. The losses of Villaret-Joyeuse in his\r\ndisastrous winter cruise in 1794 were hardly greater. The grounding\r\nof the =St. George= was attributed to the Portuguese pilot. But the\r\npresence of a pilot does not remove the responsibility of the captain\r\nand his officers. Lisbon was as familiar to us as any English port.\r\nWould a navigating officer now need a pilot when entering or leaving\r\nLisbon? And was the pilot responsible for blundering into the frigate?\r\n\r\n[4] The times entered in the logs were taken from the watches of\r\nsignal officers and masters. They were not chronometers, nor were the\r\nobservations made by men engaged in calm scientific investigation.\r\nDiscrepancies are frequent, and it is rarely, perhaps never, possible\r\nto be sure if the time at which any movement was made to within a\r\nquarter of an hour or twenty minutes. Other discrepancies are frequent.\r\n\r\n[5] The occupation of the Dutch Colonies will be told when the\r\nancillary services of the navy are dealt with as a whole.\r\n\r\n[6] Though I do not undertake to give a full account of the Commissions\r\nand their Reports, I will take leave to say a few words as to the\r\ngeneral impression an examination of them has left on me. There was\r\nwaste due:—1st, to the division of responsibility between the Admiralty\r\nBoard and the Navy Office; 2nd, to the survival of the old belief that\r\na man in a Government office committed no mortal sin if he “licked\r\nhis fingers”; 3rd, to the fact that while the work of the Admiralty\r\nand Navy Board had increased enormously since 1793, there had been no\r\nproportionate increase in the administering and supervising staff.\r\nPitt, who long clung to the belief that France would be reduced to\r\nsubmission by financial distress, and was by nature a rigid economist,\r\nwas unwilling to add to the permanent expenses of Government, and\r\naccounts remained unchecked and unbalanced for want of hands to do\r\nthe work. Money was lost, because expenditure could not be followed,\r\nand checked. Fallen mankind availed itself of the opportunity. Big\r\nmen kept public money lying at their bankers, who gave them interest\r\nfor it. Little men drew pay for work they never did. Contractors took\r\nillegitimate profits. All this was bad, but it may all be conceded,\r\nand yet we may find that we cannot accept the wholesale denunciations\r\nof the Navy Board made by St. Vincent, and by his men, notably his\r\nsycophantic secretary, Tucker. Such a story as that of the illegal—at\r\nleast the tyrannical—impressment of D. E. Bartholomew speaks very ill\r\nfor the spirit prevailing in the men about St. Vincent, and for him.\r\nThe notorious case of Sir Home Popham is even worse. Sir Home was\r\naccused of having wasted public money on the repair of his ship in\r\nIndia. He was very capable of taking care of himself, and he forced\r\nan inquiry. It was proved to demonstration that in the accounts on\r\nwhich the accusation brought against him was based, the same sums had\r\nbeen counted several times over, and some of them were given in pounds\r\nsterling, and not in the correct currency—rupees. The total was in fact\r\nmultiplied by ten, and a legitimate outlay of £7000 was swollen, either\r\nby deliberate dishonesty, or by carelessness amounting to dishonest\r\nnegligence, to an enormous figure. How many officials were denounced on\r\nno better grounds than Sir Home Popham? No man is so unscrupulous in\r\naccusation as a passionate reformer convinced of his own virtue, unless\r\nit be a follower eager to earn the approval of his reforming patron by\r\na display of zeal.\r\n\r\n[7] I give all figures _sous bénéfice d’inventaire_. Nothing is better\r\ncalculated to show how hard men find it to be accurate than the\r\ndiscrepancies between the list of ships given by different authorities\r\nin 1804, or at any time. James does not agree with Tucker (_Life of\r\nSt. Vincent_), and neither agree with Captain Desbrière (_Projets et\r\nTentatives_). It must be remembered, too, that at any given moment a\r\nsquadron might be below its establishment owing to the absence of ships\r\nin need of repair or stores, or above it because ships joined the flag\r\nas reliefs or in transit.\r\n\r\n[8] I am not unaware that Duncan’s ships bore down on the Dutch at\r\nCamperdown from windward, and that although they suffered a greater\r\nloss of life in proportion than the ships of Trafalgar, they were\r\nnot sunk, or ruined beyond repair.
