There will be observed in the parts of this Short\r\nHistory a considerable difference of method; and as such a difference is\r\nnot usual in works of the kind, it may be well to state the reasons\r\nwhich have induced me to adopt it. Early French literature is to a great\r\nextent anonymous. Moreover, even where it is not, the authors were\r\nusually more influenced by certain prevalent styles or forms than by\r\nanything else. Into these forms they threw without considerations of\r\ncongruity whatever they had to say. Nothing, for instance, can be less\r\nsuitable for historical or scientific disquisition than the octosyllabic\r\nmetre of a satiric poem. But Jean de Meung and one at least of the\r\nauthors of _Renart le Contrefait_[1] do not think of composing prose\r\ndiatribes. At one moment and place the form of the Chanson de Geste is\r\nall-absorbing, at another the form of the Roman d'Aventures, at another\r\nthe form of the Fabliau. In Book I. I shall therefore proceed by these\r\nforms, giving an account of each separately.\r\n\r\nAfter Villon the case changes. Instead of classes of chroniclers,\r\ntrouveres, jongleurs, we get individual authors of eminence and\r\nindividuality striking out their own way and saying their own say in\r\nthe manner not that is fashionable but that seems best to them. During\r\nthis time, therefore, and especially during that brilliant age of French\r\nliterature, the sixteenth century, I shall proceed by authors, taking\r\nthe most remarkable individually, and grouping their followers around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Malherbe the system of schools begins, divided\r\naccording to subjects. The poet, the dramatist, the historian, have\r\ntheir predecessors, and either intentionally copy them or intentionally\r\ninnovate upon them. Malherbe and Delille, Corneille and Lemercier,\r\nSarrasin and Rulhiere, whatever the difference of merit, stand to one\r\nanother in a definite relation, and the later writers represent more or\r\nless the accepted traditions each of his school. In this part,\r\ntherefore, I shall proceed by subjects, taking historians, poets,\r\ndramatists, etc., together. One difference will be noticed between the\r\nthird and fourth Books, dealing respectively with the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries. It has seemed unnecessary to allot a special\r\nchapter to theological and ecclesiastical writing in the latter, or to\r\nscientific writing in the former.\r\n\r\nAlmost all writers who have attempted literary histories in a small\r\ncompass have recognised the difficulty, or rather impossibility, of\r\ntreating contemporary or recent work on the same scale as older authors.\r\nIn treating, therefore, of literature subsequent to the appearance of\r\nthe Romantic movement, I shall content myself with giving a rapid sketch\r\nof the principal literary developments and their exponents.\r\n\r\nThere are doubtless objections to this quadripartite arrangement; but it\r\nappears to me better suited for the purpose of laying the foundations of\r\nan acquaintance with French literature than a more uniform plan.\r\n\r\nThe space at my disposal does not admit of combining full information as\r\nto the literature with elaborate literary comment upon its\r\ncharacteristics, and there can be no doubt that in such a book as this,\r\ndestined for purposes of education chiefly, the latter must be\r\nsacrificed to the former. As an instance of the sacrifice I may refer\r\nto Bk. I. Ch. II. There are some forty or fifty Chansons de Gestes in\r\nprint, all of which save two or three I have read, and almost every one\r\nof which presents points on which it would be most interesting to me to\r\ncomment. But to do this in the limits would be impossible. Nor is it\r\neasy to enter upon disputed literary questions, however tempting they\r\nmay be. On such points as the relations of Northern to Provencal poetry,\r\nthe origin of the Chansons and the Arthurian romances, the successive\r\nversions of Froissart, the authenticity of the last book of Rabelais, it\r\nis only possible here to indicate the most probable conclusions.\r\nGenerally speaking, the scale of treatment will be found to be adjusted\r\nto the system of division already stated. In the middle ages, where the\r\nimportance of the general form surpasses that of the individual\r\npractitioners, comparatively small space is given to these individuals,\r\nand little attempt is made to follow up the scanty and often conjectural\r\nparticulars of their lives. In the later books I have endeavoured\r\n(departing in this respect from the system of my two former sketches of\r\nthe subject, the article on 'French Literature' in the ninth edition of\r\nthe _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ and the _Primer_ which has preceded this\r\nwork in the Clarendon Press Series) to deal more fully with the greater\r\nnames whose work is most instructive, and as to whom most curiosity is\r\nlikely to be felt.\r\n\r\nIf, as seems very likely, these explanations should not content some of\r\nmy critics, I can only say that the passages which they may miss here\r\nwould have been far easier and far pleasanter for me to write than the\r\npassages which they will here find. This volume attempts to be, not a\r\nseries of _causeries_ on the literary history of France, but a Short\r\nHistory of French Literature. Two things only I have uniformly aimed at,\r\naccuracy as absolute as I could secure, and completeness as thorough as\r\nspace would allow. In the pursuit of the former object I have thought it\r\nwell to take no fact or opinion at second-hand where the originals were\r\naccessible to me. Manuscript sources I do not pretend to have\r\nconsulted; but any judgment which is passed in this book may be taken\r\nas founded on personal acquaintance with the book or author unless the\r\ncontrary be stated. Some familiarity with the subject has convinced me\r\nthat nowhere are opinions of doubtful accuracy more frequently adopted\r\nand handed on without enquiry than in the history of literature.\r\n\r\nThose who read this book for purposes of study will, it is hoped, be\r\nalready acquainted with the _Primer_, which is, in effect, an\r\nintroduction to it, and which contains what may be called a bird's-eye\r\nview of the subject. But, lest the wood should be lost sight of for the\r\ntrees, notes or interchapters have been inserted between the several\r\nbooks, indicating the general lines of development followed by the great\r\nliterature which I have attempted to survey. To these I have for the\r\nmost part confined generalisations as distinct from facts.\r\n\r\nI have, I believe, given in the notes a sufficient list of authorities\r\nwhich those who desire to follow up the subject may consult. I have not\r\nbeen indiscriminately lavish in indicating editions of authors, though I\r\nbelieve that full information will be found as to those necessary for a\r\nscholarly working knowledge of French literature. I had originally hoped\r\nto illustrate the whole book with extracts; but I discovered that such a\r\ncourse would either swell it to an undesirable bulk, or else would\r\nprovide passages too short and too few to be of much use. I have\r\ntherefore confined the extracts to the mediaeval period, which can be\r\nillustrated by selections of moderate length, and in which such\r\nillustration, from the general resemblance between the individuals of\r\neach class, and the comparative rarity of the original texts, is\r\nspecially desirable. To avoid the serious drawback of the difference of\r\nprinciple on which old French reprints have been constructed, as many of\r\nthese extracts as possible have been printed from Herr Karl Bartsch's\r\nadmirable _Chrestomathie_. But in cases where extracts were either not\r\nto be found there, or were not, in my judgment, sufficiently\r\ncharacteristic, I have departed from this plan. The illustration, by\r\nextracts, of the later literature, which requires more space, has been\r\nreserved for a separate volume.\r\n\r\nI had also intended to subjoin some tabular views of the chief literary\r\nforms, authors, and books of the successive centuries. But when I formed\r\nthis intention I was not aware that such tables already existed in a\r\nbook very likely to be in the hands of those who use this work, M.\r\nGustave Masson's _French Dictionary_. Although the plan I had formed was\r\nnot quite identical with his, and though the execution might have\r\ndiffered in detail, it seemed both unnecessary and to a certain extent\r\nungracious to trespass on the same field. With regard to dates the Index\r\nwill, it is believed, be found to contain the date of the birth and\r\ndeath, or, if these be not obtainable, the _floruit_ of every deceased\r\nauthor of any importance who is mentioned in the book. It has not seemed\r\nnecessary invariably to duplicate this information in the text. I have\r\nalso availed myself of this Index (for the compilation of which I owe\r\nmany thanks to Miss S. A. Ingham) to insert a very few particulars,\r\nwhich seemed to find a better place there than in the body of the\r\nvolume, as being not strictly literary.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think it well to say that the composition of this book\r\nhas, owing to the constant pressure of unavoidable occupations, been\r\nspread over a considerable period, and has sometimes been interrupted\r\nfor many weeks or even months. This being the case, I fear that there\r\nmay be some omissions, perhaps some inconsistencies, not improbably some\r\ndownright errors. I do not ask indulgence for these, because that no\r\nauthor who voluntarily publishes a book has a right to ask, nor,\r\nperhaps, have critics a right to give it. But if any critic will point\r\nout to me any errors of fact, I can promise repentance, as speedy\r\namendment as may be, and what is more, gratitude.\r\n\r\n    (1882.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preface to the Second Edition._--In the second edition the text has\r\nbeen very carefully revised. All corrections of fact indicated by\r\ncritics and private correspondents, both English and French (among whom\r\nI owe especial thanks to M. A. Beljame), have, after verification, been\r\nmade. A considerable number of additional dates of the publication of\r\nimportant books have been inserted in the text, and the Index has\r\nundergone a strict examination, resulting in the correction of some\r\nfaults which were due not to the original compiler but to myself. On the\r\nsuggestion of several competent authorities a Conclusion, following the\r\nlines of the Interchapters, is now added. If less deference is shown to\r\nsome strictures which have been passed on the plan of the work and the\r\nauthor's literary views, it is due merely to the conviction that a\r\nwriter must write his own book in his own way if it is to be of any good\r\nto anybody. But in a few places modifications of phrases which seemed to\r\nhave been misconceived or to be capable of misconception have been made.\r\nI have only to add sincere thanks to my critics for the very general\r\nand, I fear, scarcely deserved approval with which this Short History of\r\na long subject has been received, and to my readers for the promptness\r\nwith which a second edition of it has been demanded.\r\n\r\n    (1884.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preface to the Third Edition._--In making, once more, an examination of\r\nthis book for the purposes of a third edition I have again done my best\r\nto correct such mistakes as must (I think I may say inevitably) occur in\r\na very large number of compressed statements about matter often in\r\nitself of great minuteness and complexity. I have found some such\r\nmistakes, and I make no doubt that I have left some.\r\n\r\nIn the process of examination I have had the assistance of two detailed\r\nreviews of parts of the book by two French critics, each of very high\r\nrepute in his way. The first of these, by M. Gaston Paris, in _Romania_\r\n(XII, 602 _sqq._), devoted to the mediaeval section only, actually\r\nappeared before my second edition: but accident prevented my availing\r\nmyself of it fully, though some important corrections suggested by it\r\nwere made on a slip inserted in most of the copies of that issue. The\r\nassistance thus given by M. Paris (whose forbearance in using his great\r\nlearning as a specialist I have most cordially to acknowledge) has been\r\nsupplemented by the appearance, quite recently, of an admirable\r\ncondensed sketch of his own[2], which, compact as it is, is a very\r\nstorehouse of information on the subject. If in this book I have not\r\ninvariably accepted M. Paris' views or embodied his corrections, it is\r\nmerely because in points of opinion and inference as opposed to\r\nascertained fact, the use of independent judgment seems to me always\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nThe other criticism (in this case of the later part of my book), by M.\r\nEdmond Scherer, would not seem to have been written in the same spirit.\r\nM. Scherer holds very different views from mine on literature in general\r\nand French literature in particular; he seems (which is perhaps natural)\r\nnot to be able to forgive me the difference, and to imagine (which if\r\nnot unnatural is perhaps a little unreasonable, a little uncharitable,\r\nand even, considering an express statement in my preface, a little\r\nimpolite) that I cannot have read the works on which we differ. I am\r\nhowever grateful to him for showing that a decidedly hostile\r\nexamination, conducted with great minuteness and carefully confined to\r\nthose parts of the subject with which the critic is best acquainted,\r\nresulted in nothing but the discovery of about half a dozen or a dozen\r\nmisprints and slips of fact[3]. One only of these (the very unpardonable\r\nblunder of letting Madame de Stael's _Considerations_ appear as an\r\nearly work, which I do not know how I came either to commit or to\r\noverlook) is of real importance. Such slips I have corrected with due\r\ngratitude. But I have not altered passages where M. Scherer mistakes\r\nfacts or mistakes me. I need hardly say that I have made no alterations\r\nin criticism, and that the passage referring to M. Scherer himself (with\r\nthe exception of a superfluous accent) stands precisely as it did.\r\n\r\nSome additions have been made to the latter part of the book, but not\r\nvery many: for the attempt to 'write up' such a history to date every\r\nfew years can only lead to confusion and disproportion. I have had,\r\nduring the decade which has passed since the book was first planned,\r\nrather unusual opportunities of acquainting myself with all new French\r\nbooks of any importance, but a history is not a periodical, and I have\r\nthought it best to give rather grudging than free admittance to\r\nnew-comers. On the other hand, I have endeavoured, as far as possible,\r\nto obliterate chronological references which the effluxion of time has\r\nrendered, or may render, misleading. The notes to which it seemed most\r\nimportant to attract attention, as modifying or enlarging some statement\r\nin the text, are specially headed 'Notes to Third Edition': but they\r\nrepresent only a small part of the labour which has been expended on the\r\ntext. I have also again overhauled and very considerably enlarged the\r\nindex; while the amplification of the 'Contents' by subjoining to each\r\nchapter-heading a list of the side-headings of the paragraphs it\r\ncontains, will, I think, be found an advantage. And so I commend the\r\nbook once more to readers and to students[4].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Note to Third Edition._--M. Gaston Paris expresses some surprise at\r\nmy saying 'one of the authors,' and attributes both versions to the\r\nTroyes clerk (see pp. 52, 53). I can only say that so long as _Renart le\r\nContrefait_ is unpublished, if not longer, such a question is difficult\r\nto decide: and that the accepted monograph on the subject (that of Wolf)\r\nleft on my mind the impression of plural authorship as probable.\r\n\r\n[2] _La Litterature Francaise du Moyen Age_ (Paris, 1888).\r\n\r\n[3] A preface is but an ill place for controversy. As however M.\r\nScherer, thanks chiefly to the late Mr. Matthew Arnold, enjoys some\r\nrepute in England, I may give an example of his censure. He accuses me\r\nroundly of giving in my thirty dates of Corneille's plays 'une dizaine\r\nde fausses,' and he quotes (as I do) M. Marty-Laveaux. As since the\r\nbeginning, years ago, of my Cornelian studies, I have constantly used\r\nthat excellent edition, though, now as always, reserving my own judgment\r\non points of opinion, I verified M. Scherer's appeal with some alarm at\r\nfirst, and more amusement afterwards. The eminent critic of the _Temps_\r\nhad apparently contented himself with turning to the half-titles of the\r\nplays and noting the dates given, which in ten instances do differ from\r\nmine. Had his patience been equal to consulting the learned editor's\r\n_Notices_, he would have found in every case but one the reasons which\r\nprevailed and prevail with me given by M. Marty-Laveaux himself. The one\r\nexception I admit. I was guilty of the iniquity of confusing the date of\r\nthe publication of _Othon_ with the date of its production, and printing\r\n1665 instead of 1664. So dangerous is it to digest and weigh an editor's\r\narguments, instead of simply copying his dates. Had I done the latter, I\r\nhad 'scaped M. Scherer's tooth.\r\n\r\n[4] The remarks on M. Scherer in this preface (and I need hardly say\r\nstill more those which occur in the body of the book with reference to a\r\nfew others of his criticisms) were written long before his fatal\r\nillness, and had been sent finally to press some time before the\r\nannouncement of his death. I had at first thought of endeavouring to\r\nsuppress those which could be recalled. But it seemed to me on\r\nreflection that the best compliment to the memory of a man who was\r\nhimself nothing if not uncompromising, and towards whom, whether alive\r\nor dead, I am not conscious of having entertained any ill-feeling, would\r\nbe to print them exactly as they stood, with the brief addition that I\r\nhave not known a critic more acute within his range, or more honest\r\naccording to what he saw, than M. Edmond Scherer.

In actual age it may possibly yield to others, but the\r\nconnection between the language of the oldest and the language of the\r\nnewest French literature is far closer than in these other cases, and\r\nthe fecundity of mediaeval writers in France far exceeds that of their\r\nrivals elsewhere. For something like three centuries England, Germany,\r\nItaly, and more doubtfully and to a smaller extent, Spain, were content\r\nfor the most part to borrow the matter and the manner of their literary\r\nwork from France. This brilliant literature was however long before it\r\nassumed a regularly organized form, and in order that it might do so a\r\nprevious literature and a previous language had to be dissolved and\r\nprecipitated anew. With a few exceptions, to be presently noticed,\r\nFrench literature is not to be found till after the year 1000, that is\r\nto say until a greater lapse of time had passed since Caesar's campaigns\r\nthan has passed from the later date to the present day. Taking the\r\nearliest of all monuments, the Strasburg Oaths, as starting-point, we\r\nmay say that French language and French literature were nine hundred\r\nyears in process of formation. The result was a remarkable one in\r\nlinguistic history. French is unquestionably a daughter of Latin, yet it\r\nis not such a daughter as Italian or Spanish. A knowledge of the older\r\nlanguage would enable a reader who knew no other to spell out, more or\r\nless painfully, the meaning of most pages of the two Peninsular\r\nlanguages; it would hardly enable him to do more than guess at the\r\nmeaning of a page of French. The long process of gestation transformed\r\nthe appearance of the new tongue completely, though its grammatical\r\nforms and the bulk of its vocabulary are beyond all question Latin. The\r\nhistory of this process belongs to the head of language, not of\r\nliterature, and must be sought elsewhere. It is sufficient to say that\r\nthe first mention of a _lingua romana rustica_ is found in the seventh\r\ncentury, while allusions in Latin documents show us its gradual use in\r\npulpit and market-place, and even as a vehicle for the rude songs of the\r\nminstrel, long before any trace of written French can be found.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of Latin Literature.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Latin was doing more than merely furnishing the\r\nmaterials of the new language. The literary faculty of the Gauls was\r\nearly noticed, and before their subjection had long been completed they\r\nwere adepts at using the language of the conquerors. It does not fall\r\nwithin our plan to notice in detail the Latin literature of Gaul and\r\nearly France, but the later varieties of that literature deserve some\r\nlittle attention, because of the influence which they undoubtedly\r\nexercised on the literary forms of the new language. In early French\r\nthere is little trace of the influence of the Latin forms which we call\r\nclassical. It was the forms of the language which has been said to have\r\n'dived under ground with Naevius and come up again with Prudentius' that\r\nreally influenced the youthful tongue. Ecclesiastical Latin, and\r\nespecially the wonderful melody of the early Latin hymn-writers, had by\r\nfar the greatest effect upon it. Ingenious and not wholly groundless\r\nefforts have been made to trace the principal forms of early French\r\nwriting to the services and service-books of the church, the chronicle\r\nto the sacred histories, the lyric to the psalm and the hymn, the\r\nmystery to the elaborate and dramatic ritual of the church. The _Chanson\r\nde Geste_, indeed, displays in its matter and style many traces of\r\nGermanic origin, but the metre with its regular iambic cadence and its\r\nrigid caesura testifies to Latin influence. The service thus performed\r\nto the literature was not unlike the service performed to the language.\r\nIn the one case the scaffolding, or rather the skeleton, was furnished\r\nin the shape of grammar; in the other a similar skeleton, in the shape\r\nof prosody, was supplied. Important additions were indeed made by the\r\nfresh elements introduced. Rhyme Latin had itself acquired. But of the\r\nmusical refrains which are among the most charming features of early\r\nFrench lyric poetry we find no vestige in the older tongue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Monuments.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the French language, as far as concerns literature, from\r\nthe seventh to the eleventh century, can be rapidly given. The earliest\r\nmention of the Romance tongue as distinguished from Latin and from\r\nGerman dialect refers to 659, and occurs in the life of St. Mummolinus\r\nor Momolenus, bishop of Noyon, who was chosen for that office because of\r\nhis knowledge of the two languages, Teutonic and Romanic[5]. We may\r\ntherefore assume that Mummolinus preached in the _lingua Romana_. To the\r\nsame century is referred the song of St. Faron, bishop of Meaux[6], but\r\nthis only exists in Latin, and a Romance original is inferred rather\r\nthan proved. In the eighth century the Romance eloquence of St. Adalbert\r\nis commended[7], and to the same period are referred the glossaries of\r\nReichenau and Cassel, lists containing in the first case Latin and\r\nRomance equivalents, in the second Teutonic and Romance[8]. By the\r\nbeginning of the ninth century it was compulsory for bishops to preach\r\nin Romance, and to translate such Latin homilies as they read[9]; and to\r\nthis same era has been referred a fragmentary commentary on the Book of\r\nJonah[10], included in the latest collection of 'Monuments[11].' In 842\r\nwe have the Strasburg Oaths, celebrated alike in French history and\r\nFrench literature. The text of the MS. of Nithard which contains them is\r\nof the tenth century.\r\n\r\nWe now come to documents less shapeless. The tenth century itself gives\r\nus the song of St. Eulalie, a poem on the Passion, a life of St. Leger,\r\nand perhaps a poem on Boethius. These four documents are of the highest\r\ninterest. Not merely has the language assumed a tolerably regular form,\r\nbut its great division into Langue d'Oc and Langue d'Oil is already\r\nmade, and grammar, prosody, and other necessities or ornaments of\r\nbookwriting, are present. The following extracts will illustrate this\r\npart of French literature. The Romance oaths and the 'St. Eulalie' are\r\ngiven in full, the 'Passion' and the 'St. Leger' in extract; it will be\r\nobserved that the interval between the first and the others is of very\r\nconsiderable width. This interval probably represents a century of\r\nactive change, and of this unfortunately we have no monuments to mark\r\nthe progress accurately.\r\n\r\n\r\nLES SERMENTS DE STRASBOURG DE 842.\r\n\r\n     Pro deo amur et pro christian poblo et nostro commun\r\n     salvament, d'ist di in avant, in quant deus savir et podir\r\n     me dunat, si salvarai eo cist meon fradre Karlo et in aiudha\r\n     et in cadhuna cosa, si cum on per dreit son fradra salvar\r\n     dist, in o quid il mi altresi fazet, et ab Ludher nul plaid\r\n     nunqua prindrai, qui meon vol cist meon fradre Karle in\r\n     damno sit.\r\n\r\n     Si Lodhuvigs sagrament, quae son fradre Karlo jurat,\r\n     conservat, et Karlus meos sendra de sua part nun los tanit,\r\n     si io returnar nun l'int pois, ne io ne neuls, cui eo\r\n     returnar int pois, in nulla aiudha contra Lodhuwig nun li iv\r\n     er.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTILENE DE SAINTE EULALIE.\r\n\r\n    Buona pulcella fut Eulalia,\r\n    bel auret corps, bellezour anima.\r\n      Voldrent la veintre li deo inimi,\r\n    voldrent la faire diaule servir.\r\n      Elle non eskoltet les mals conselliers,\r\n    qu'elle deo raneiet, chi maent sus en ciel,\r\n      Ne por or ned argent ne paramenz,\r\n    por manatce regiel ne preiement.\r\n      Niule cose non la pouret omque pleier,\r\n    la polle sempre non amast lo deo menestier.\r\n      E poro fut presentede Maximiien,\r\n    chi rex eret a cels dis sovre pagiens\r\n      El li enortet, dont lei nonque chielt.\r\n    qued elle fuiet lo nom christiien.\r\n      Ell' ent adunet lo suon element,\r\n    melz sostendreiet les empedementz,\r\n      Qu'elle perdesse sa virginitet:\r\n    poros furet morte a grand honestet.\r\n      Enz enl fou la getterent, com arde tost.\r\n    elle colpes non auret, poro nos coist.\r\n      A ezo nos voldret concreidre li rex pagiens;\r\n    ad une spede li roveret tolir lo chief.\r\n      La domnizelle celle kose non contredist,\r\n    volt lo seule lazsier, si ruovet Krist.\r\n      In figure de colomb volat a ciel.\r\n    tuit orem, que por nos deguet preier,\r\n      Qued auuisset de nos Christus mercit\r\n    post la mort et a lui nos laist venir\r\n      Par souue clementia.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA PASSION DU CHRIST.\r\n\r\n      Christus Jhesus den s'en leved,\r\n    Gehsesmani vil' es n'anez.\r\n    toz sos fidels seder rovet,\r\n    avan orar sols en anet.\r\n      Grant fu li dois, fort marrimenz.\r\n    si condormirent tuit ades.\r\n    Jhesus cum veg los esveled,\r\n    trestoz orar ben los manded.\r\n      E dunc orar cum el anned,\r\n    si fort sudor dunques suded,\r\n    que cum lo sangs a terra curren\r\n    de sa sudor las sanctas gutas.\r\n      Als sos fidels cum repadred,\r\n    tam benlement los conforted\r\n    li fel Judas ja s'aproismed\r\n    ab gran cumpannie dels judeus.\r\n      Jhesus cum vidra los judeus,\r\n    zo lor demandet que querent.\r\n    il li respondent tuit adun\r\n    'Jhesum querem _Nazarenum_.'\r\n      'Eu soi aquel,' zo dis Jhesus.\r\n    tuit li felun cadegren jos.\r\n    terce ves lor o demanded,\r\n    a totas treis chedent envers.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIE DE SAINT LEGER.\r\n\r\n      Domine deu devemps lauder\r\n    et a sus sancz honor porter;\r\n    in su' amor cantomps dels sanz\r\n    quae por lui augrent granz aanz;\r\n    et or es temps et si est biens\r\n    quae nos cantumps de sant Lethgier.\r\n      Primos didrai vos dels honors\r\n    quie il auuret ab duos seniors;\r\n    apres ditrai vos dels aanz\r\n    que li suos corps susting si granz,\r\n    et Evvruins, cil deumentiz,\r\n    qui lui a grand torment occist.\r\n      Quant infans fud, donc a ciels temps\r\n    al rei lo duistrent soi parent,\r\n    qui donc regnevet a ciel di:\r\n    cio fud Lothiers fils Baldequi.\r\n    il le amat; deu lo covit;\r\n    rovat que _litteras_ apresist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dialects and Provincial Literatures.]\r\n\r\nConsidering the great extent and the political divisions of the country\r\ncalled France, it is not surprising that the language which was so\r\nslowly formed should have shown considerable dialectic variations. The\r\ncharacteristics of these dialects, Norman, Picard, Walloon, Champenois,\r\nAngevin, and so forth, have been much debated by philologists. But it so\r\nhappens that the different provinces displayed in point of literature\r\nconsiderable idiosyncrasy, which it is scarcely possible to dispute.\r\nHardly a district of France but contributed something special to her\r\nwide and varied literature. The South, though its direct influence was\r\nnot great, undoubtedly set the example of attention to lyrical form and\r\ncadence. Britanny contributed the wonderfully suggestive Arthurian\r\nlegends, and the peculiar music and style of the _lai_. The border\r\ndistricts of Flanders seem to deserve the credit of originating the\r\ngreat beast-epic of Reynard the Fox; Picardy, Eastern Normandy, and the\r\nIsle of France were peculiarly rich in the _fabliau_; Champagne was the\r\nspecial home of the lighter lyric poetry, while almost all northern\r\nFrance had a share in the Chansons de Gestes, many districts, such as\r\nLorraine and the Cambresis, having a special _geste_ of their own.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beginning of Literature proper.]\r\n\r\nIt is however with the eleventh century that the history of French\r\nliterature properly so called begins. We have indeed few Romance\r\nmanuscripts so early as this, the date of most of them not being earlier\r\nthan the twelfth. But by the eleventh century not merely were laws\r\nwritten in French (charters and other formal documents were somewhat\r\nlater), not merely were sermons constantly composed and preached in that\r\ntongue, but also works of definite literature were produced in it. The\r\n_Chanson de Roland_ is our only instance of its epic literature, but is\r\nnot likely to have stood alone: the mystery of _The Ten Virgins_, a\r\nmedley of French and Latin, has been (but perhaps falsely) ascribed to\r\nthe same date; and lyric poetry, even putting aside the obscure and\r\ndoubtful _Cantilenes_, was certainly indulged in to a considerable\r\nextent. From this date it is therefore possible to abandon generalities,\r\nand taking the successive forms and developments of literature, to deal\r\nwith them in detail.\r\n\r\nBefore however we attempt a systematic account of French literature as\r\nit has been actually handed down to us, it is necessary to deal very\r\nbriefly with two questions, one of which concerns the antecedence of\r\npossible ballad literature to the existing Chansons de Gestes, the other\r\nthe machinery of diffusion to which this and all the early historical\r\ndevelopments of the written French language owed much.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cantilenae.]\r\n\r\nIt has been held by many scholars, whose opinions deserve respect, that\r\nan extensive literature of _Cantilenae_[12], or short historical\r\nballads, preceded the lengthy epics which we now possess, and was to a\r\ncertain extent worked up in these compositions. It is hardly necessary\r\nto say that this depends in part upon a much larger question--the\r\nquestion, namely, of the general origins of epic poetry. There are\r\nindeed certain references[13] to these Cantilenae upon which the\r\ntheories alluded to have been built. But the Cantilenae themselves have,\r\nas one of the best of French literary historians, the late M. Paulin\r\nParis, remarks of another debated product, the Provencal epic, only one\r\ndefect, 'le defaut d'etre perdu,' and investigation on the subject is\r\ntherefore more curious than profitable. No remnant of them survives save\r\nthe already-mentioned Latin prose canticle of St. Faron, in which\r\nvestiges of a French and versified original are thought to be visible,\r\nand the ballad of Saucourt, a rough song in a Teutonic dialect[14]. In\r\ndefault of direct evidence an argument has been sought to be founded on\r\nthe constant transitions, repetitions, and other peculiarities of the\r\nChansons, some of which (and especially _Roland_, the most famous of\r\nall) present traces of repeated handlings of the same subject, such as\r\nmight be expected in work which was merely that of a _diaskeuast_[15] of\r\nexisting lays.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trouveres and Jongleurs.]\r\n\r\nIt is however probable that the explanation of this phenomenon need not\r\nbe sought further than in the circumstances of the composition and\r\npublication of these poems, circumstances which also had a very\r\nconsiderable influence on the whole course and character of early French\r\nliterature. We know nothing of the rise or origin of the two classes of\r\n_Trouveurs_ and _Jongleurs_. The former (which it is needless to say is\r\nthe same word as _Troubadour_, and _Trobador_, and _Trovatore_) is the\r\nterm for the composing class, the latter for the performing one. But the\r\nseparation was not sharp or absolute, and there are abundant instances\r\nof Trouveres[16] who performed their own works, and of Jongleurs who\r\naspired to the glories if not of original authorship, at any rate of\r\nalteration and revision of the legends they sang or recited. The natural\r\nconsequence of this irregular form of publication was a good deal of\r\nrepetition in the works published. Different versions of the legends\r\neasily enough got mixed together by the copyist, who it must be\r\nremembered was frequently a mere mechanical reproducer, and neither\r\nTrouvere nor Jongleur; nor should it be forgotten that, so long as\r\nrecitation was general, repetitions of this kind were almost inevitable\r\nas a rest to the reciter's memory, and were scarcely likely to attract\r\nunfavourable remark or criticism from the audience. We may therefore\r\nconclude, without entering further into the details of a debate\r\nunsuitable to the plan of this history, that, while but scanty evidence\r\nhas been shown of the existence previous to the _Chansons de Gestes_ of\r\na ballad literature identical in subject with those compositions, at the\r\nsame time the existence of such a literature is neither impossible nor\r\nimprobable. It is otherwise with the hypothesis of the existence of\r\nprose chronicles, from which the early epics (and _Roland_ in\r\nparticular) are also held to have derived their origin. But this subject\r\nwill be better handled when we come to treat of the beginnings of French\r\nprose. For the present it is sufficient to say that, with the exception\r\nof the scattered fragments already commented upon, there is no\r\ndepartment of French literature before the eleventh century and the\r\n_Chansons de Gestes_, which possesses historical existence proved by\r\nactual monuments, and thus demands or deserves treatment here.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] 'Fama bonorum operum, quia praevalebat non tantum in Teutonica sed\r\nin Romana lingua, Lotharii regis ad aures usque perveniente,' says his\r\nlife. The chronicler Sigebert confirms the statement that he was made\r\nbishop 'quod Romanam non minus quam Teutonicam calleret linguam.'\r\n_Lingua Latina_ and _Lingua Romana_ are from this time distinguished.\r\n\r\n[6] The Latin form of the song is given by Helgaire, Bishop of Meaux,\r\nwho wrote a life of St. Faron, his predecessor, towards the end of the\r\nninth century. Helgaire uses the words 'juxta rusticitatem,' 'carmen\r\nrusticum;' and _Lingua Rustica_ is usually if not universally synonymous\r\nwith _Lingua Romana_.\r\n\r\n[7] 'Si vulgari id est romana lingua loqueretur omnium aliarum putares\r\ninscium.'\r\n\r\n[8] The Reichenau Glossary is at Carlsruhe. It was published in 1863 by\r\nHoltzmann. The Cassel Glossary, which came from Fulda, was published in\r\nthe last century (1729).\r\n\r\n[9] Ordered by the Councils of Tours, Rheims, and Arles (813-851).\r\n\r\n[10] In the Library at Valenciennes.\r\n\r\n[11] _Les plus anciens Monuments de la Langue Francaise._ Paris, 1875.\r\n\r\n[12] The subject of the Cantilenae is discussed at great length by M.\r\nLeon Gautier, _Les Epopees Francaises_, Ed. 2, vol. i. caps. 8-13.\r\nParis, 1878.\r\n\r\n[13] These, which are for the most part very vague and not very early,\r\nwill be found fully quoted and discussed in Gautier, l. c.\r\n\r\n[14] Published by Hoffmann von Fallersleben (1837).\r\n\r\n[15] This word (= arranger or putter-in-order) is familiar in Homeric\r\ndiscussion, and therefore seems appropriate. M. Gaston Paris speaks with\r\napparent confidence of the pre-existing _chants_, and, in matter of\r\nauthority, no one speaks with more than he: but it can hardly be said\r\nthat there is proof of the fact.\r\n\r\n[16] The older and in this case more usual form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CHANSONS DE GESTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest form which finished literature took in France was that of\r\nepic or narrative poetry. Towards the middle of the eleventh century\r\ncertainly, and probably some half-century earlier, poems of regular\r\nconstruction and considerable length began to be written. These are the\r\n_Chansons de Gestes_, so called from their dealing with the\r\n_Gestes_[17], or heroic families of legendary or historical France. It\r\nis remarkable that this class of composition, notwithstanding its age,\r\nits merits, and the abundant examples of it which have been preserved,\r\nwas one of the latest to receive recognition in modern times. The matter\r\nof many of the Chansons, under their later form of verse or prose\r\nromances of chivalry, was indeed more or less known in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. But an appreciation of their real age, value, and interest has\r\nbeen the reward of the literary investigations of our own time. It was\r\nnot till 1837 that the oldest and the most remarkable of them was first\r\nedited from the manuscript found in the Bodleian Library[18]. Since that\r\ntime investigation has been constant and fruitful, and there are now\r\nmore than one hundred of these interesting poems known.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin of Chansons de Gestes.]\r\n\r\nThe origin and sources of the _Chansons de Gestes_ have been made a\r\nmatter of much controversy. We have already seen how, from the testimony\r\nof historians and the existence of a few fragments, it appears that rude\r\nlays or ballads in the different vernacular tongues of the country were\r\ncomposed and sung if not written down at very early dates. According to\r\none theory, we are to look for the origin of the long and regular epics\r\nof the eleventh and subsequent centuries in these rude compositions,\r\nfirst produced independently, then strung together, and lastly subjected\r\nto some process of editing and union. It has been sought to find proof\r\nof this in the frequent repetitions which take place in the Chansons,\r\nand which sometimes amount to the telling of the same incident over and\r\nover again in slightly varying words. Others have seen in this\r\npeculiarity only a result of improvisation in the first place, and\r\nunskilful or at least uncritical copying in the second. This, however,\r\nis a question rather interesting than important. What is certain is that\r\nno literary source of the Chansons is now actually in existence, and\r\nthat we have no authentic information as to any such originals. At a\r\ncertain period--approximately given above--the fashion of narrative\r\npoems on the great scale seems to have arisen in France. It spread\r\nrapidly, and was eagerly copied by other nations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definition.]\r\n\r\nThe definition of a _Chanson de Geste_ is as follows. It is a narrative\r\npoem, dealing with a subject connected with French history, written in\r\nverses of ten or twelve syllables, which verses are arranged in stanzas\r\nof arbitrary length, each stanza possessing a distinguishing assonance\r\nor rhyme in the last syllable of each line. The assonance, which is\r\ncharacteristic of the earlier Chansons, is an imperfect rhyme, in which\r\nidentity of vowel sound is all that is necessary. Thus _traitor_,\r\n_felon_, _compaingnons_, _manons_, _noz_, the first, fourth, and fifth\r\nof which have no character of rhyme whatever in modern poetry, are\r\nsufficient terminations for an assonanced poem, because the last vowel\r\nsound, o, is identical. There is moreover in this versification a\r\nregular caesura, sometimes after the fourth, sometimes after the sixth\r\nsyllable; and in a few of the older examples the stanzas, or as they are\r\nsometimes called _laisses_, terminate in a shorter line than usual,\r\nwhich is not assonanced. This metrical system, it will be observed, is\r\nof a fairly elaborate character, a character which has been used as an\r\nargument by those who insist on the existence of a body of ballad\r\nliterature anterior to the Chansons. We shall see in the following\r\nchapters how this double definition of a _Chanson de Geste_, by matter\r\nand by form, serves to exclude from the title other important and\r\ninteresting classes of compositions slightly later in date.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Period of Composition.]\r\n\r\nThe period of composition of these poems extended, speaking roughly,\r\nover three centuries. In the eleventh they began, but the beginnings are\r\nrepresented only by _Roland_, the _Voyage de Charlemagne_, and perhaps\r\n_Le Roi Louis_. Most and nearly all the best date from the twelfth. The\r\nthirteenth century also produces them in great numbers, but by this time\r\na sensible change has come over their manner, and after the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth only a few pieces deserving the title are written. They\r\nthen undergo transformation rather than neglect, and we shall meet them\r\nat a later period in other forms. Before dealing with other general\r\ncharacteristics of the early epics of France it will be well to give\r\nsome notion of them by actual selection and narrative. For this purpose\r\nwe shall take two Chansons typical of two out of the three stages\r\nthrough which they passed. _Roland_ will serve as a sample of the\r\nearliest, _Amis et Amiles_ of the second. Of the third, as less\r\ncharacteristic in itself and less marked by uniform features, it will be\r\nsufficient to give some account when we come to the compositions which\r\nchiefly influenced it, namely the romances of Arthur and of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chanson de Roland.]\r\n\r\nThe _Chanson de Roland_, the most ancient and characteristic of these\r\npoems, though extremely popular in the middle ages[19], passed with them\r\ninto obscurity. The earliest allusion to the Oxford MS., which alone\r\nrepresents its earliest form, was made by Tyrwhitt a century ago.\r\nConybeare forty years later dealt with it in the _Gentleman's Magazine_\r\nof 1817, and by degrees the reviving interest of France in her older\r\nliterature attracted French scholars to this most important monument of\r\nthe oldest French. It was first published as a whole by M. F. Michel in\r\n1837, and since that time it has been the subject of a very great amount\r\nof study. Its length is 4001 decasyllabic lines, and it concludes with\r\nan obscure assertion of authorship, publication or transcription by a\r\ncertain Turoldus[20]. The date of the Oxford MS. is probably the middle\r\nof the twelfth century, but its text is attributed by the best\r\nauthorities to the end of the eleventh. There are other MSS., but they\r\nare all either mutilated or of much later date. The argument of the poem\r\nis as follows:--\r\n\r\nCharlemagne has warred seven years in Spain, but king Marsile of\r\nSaragossa still resists the Christian conqueror. Unable however to meet\r\nCharlemagne in the field, he sends an embassy with presents and a\r\nfeigned submission, requesting that prince to return to France, whither\r\nhe will follow him and do homage. Roland opposes the reception of these\r\noffers, Ganelon speaks in their favour, and so does Duke Naimes. Then\r\nthe question is who shall go to Saragossa to settle the terms. Roland\r\noffers to go himself, but being rejected as too impetuous, suggests\r\nGanelon--a suggestion which bitterly annoys that knight and by\r\nirritating him against Roland sows the seeds of his future treachery.\r\nGanelon goes to Marsile, and at first bears himself truthfully and\r\ngallantly. The heathen king however undermines his faith, and a\r\ntreacherous assault on the French rearguard when Charlemagne shall be\r\ntoo far off to succour it is resolved on and planned. Then the traitor\r\nreturns to Charles with hostages and mighty gifts. The return to France\r\nbegins; Roland is stationed to his great wrath in the fatal place, the\r\nrest of the army marches through the Pyrenees, and meanwhile Marsile\r\ngathers an enormous host to fall upon the isolated rearguard. There is a\r\nlong catalogue of the felon and miscreant knights and princes that\r\nfollow the Spanish king. The pagan host, travelling by cross paths of\r\nthe mountains, soon reaches and surrounds Roland and the peers. Oliver\r\nentreats Roland to sound his horn that Charles may hear it and come to\r\nthe rescue, but the eager and inflexible hero refuses. Archbishop Turpin\r\nblesses the doomed host, and bids them as the price of his absolution\r\nstrike hard. The battle begins and all its incidents are told. The\r\nFrench kill thousands, but thousands more succeed. Peer after peer\r\nfalls, and when at last Roland blows the horn it is too late.\r\nCharlemagne hears it and turns back in an agony of sorrow and haste. But\r\nlong before he reaches Roncevaux Roland has died last of his host, and\r\nalone, for all the Pagans have fallen or fled before him.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Charlemagne, his grief, and his vengeance on the Pagans,\r\nshould perhaps conclude the poem. There is however a sort of afterpiece,\r\nin which the traitor Ganelon is tried, his fate being decided by a\r\nsingle combat between his kinsman Pinabel and a champion named Thierry,\r\nand is ruthlessly put to death with all his clansmen who have stood\r\nsurety for him. Episodes properly so called the poem has none, though\r\nthe character of Oliver is finely brought out as contrasted with\r\nRoland's somewhat unreasoning valour, and there is one touching incident\r\nwhen the poet tells how the Lady Aude, Oliver's sister and Roland's\r\nbetrothed, falls dead without a word when the king tells her of the\r\nfatal fight at Roncevaux. The following passage will give an idea of the\r\nstyle of this famous poem. It may be noticed that the curious refrain\r\n_Aoi_ has puzzled all commentators, though in calling it a refrain we\r\nhave given the most probable explanation:--\r\n\r\n      Rollanz s'en turnet, par le camp vait tut suls\r\n    cercet les vals e si cercet les munz;\r\n    iloec truvat Ivorie et Ivun,\r\n    truvat Gerin, Gerer sun cumpaignun,\r\n    iloec truvat Engeler le Gascun\r\n    e si truvat Berenger e Orun,\r\n    iloec truvat Anseis e Sansun,\r\n    truvat Gerard le veill de Russillun:\r\n    par un e un les ad pris le barun,\r\n    al arcevesque en est venuz atut,\r\n    sis mist en reng dedevant ses genuilz.\r\n    li arcevesque ne poet muer n'en plurt;\r\n    lievet sa main, fait sa beneicun;\r\n    apres ad dit 'mare fustes, seignurs!\r\n    tutes voz anmes ait deus li glorius!\r\n    en pareis les mete en seintes flurs!\r\n    la meie mort me rent si anguissus,\r\n    ja ne verrai le riche empereur.'\r\n      Rollanz s'en turnet, le camp vait recercer;\r\n    desoz un pin e folut e ramer\r\n    sun cumpaignun ad truved Oliver,\r\n    cuntre sun piz estreit l'ad enbracet.\r\n    si cum il poet al arcevesque en vent,\r\n    sur un escut l'ad as altres culchet;\r\n    e l'arcevesque l'ad asols e seignet.\r\n    idonc agreget le doel e la pitet.\r\n    co dit Rollanz 'bels cumpainz Oliver,\r\n    vos fustes filz al bon cunte Reiner,\r\n    ki tint la marche de Genes desur mer;\r\n    pur hanste freindre e pur escuz pecier\r\n    e pur osberc e rompre e desmailler,\r\n    [pur orgoillos veintre e esmaier]\r\n    e pur prozdomes tenir e conseiller\r\n    e pur glutuns e veintre e esmaier\r\n    en nule terre n'ot meillor chevaler.'\r\n      Li quens Rollanz, quant il veit morz ses pers\r\n    e Oliver, qu'il tant poeit amer,\r\n    tendrur en out, cumencet a plurer,\r\n    en sun visage fut mult desculurez.\r\n    si grant doel out que mais ne pout ester,\r\n    voeillet o nun, a terre chet pasmet.\r\n    dist l'arcevesques 'tant mare fustes, ber.'\r\n      Li arcevesques quant vit pasmer Rollant,\r\n    dunc out tel doel, unkes mais n'out si grant;\r\n    tendit sa main, si ad pris l'olifan.\r\n    en Rencesvals ad une ewe curant;\r\n    aler i volt, si'n durrat a Rollant.\r\n    tant s'esforcat qu'il se mist en estant,\r\n    sun petit pas s'en turnet cancelant,\r\n    il est si fieble qu'il ne poet en avant,\r\n    nen ad vertut, trop ad perdut del sanc.\r\n    einz que om alast un sul arpent de camp,\r\n    fait li le coer, si est chaeit avant:\r\n    la sue mort li vait mult angoissant.\r\n      Li quenz Rollanz revient de pasmeisuns,\r\n    sur piez se drecet, mais il ad grant dulur;\r\n    guardet aval e si guardet amunt:\r\n    sur l'erbe verte, ultre ses cumpaignuns,\r\n    la veit gesir le nobilie barun,\r\n    co est l'arcevesque que deus mist en sun num;\r\n    cleimet sa culpe, si reguardet amunt,\r\n    cuntre le ciel amsdous ses mains ad juinz,\r\n    si priet deu que pareis li duinst.\r\n    morz est Turpin le guerreier Charlun.\r\n    par granz batailles e par mult bels sermons\r\n    cuntre paiens fut tuz tens campiuns.\r\n    deus li otreit seinte beneicun!

This popularity may partly be assigned to the religious and\r\nmarvellous elements which it contains, but is due also to the intrinsic\r\nmerits of the story. The Chanson contains 3500 lines, dates probably\r\nfrom the twelfth century, and is written, like _Roland_, in decasyllabic\r\nverse, but, unlike _Roland_, has a shorter line of six syllables and not\r\nassonanced at the end of each stanza. Its story is as follows:--\r\n\r\nAmis and Amiles were two noble knights, born and baptized on the same\r\nday, who had the Pope for sponsor, and whose comradeship was specially\r\nsanctioned by a divine message, and by the miraculous likeness which\r\nexisted between them. They were however brought up, the one in Berri,\r\nthe other in Auvergne, and did not meet till both had received\r\nknighthood. As soon as they had joined company, they resolved to offer\r\ntheir services to Charles, and did him great service against rebels.\r\nHere the action proper begins. The friends arouse the jealousy of\r\nHardre, a felon knight, of Ganelon's lineage and likeness. Hardre\r\nengages Gombaud of Lorraine, an enemy of the Emperor, to attack the two\r\nfriends; but the treason does not succeed, and the traitor, to escape\r\nunpleasant enquiries, recommends Charles to bestow his own niece Lubias\r\non Amiles. The latter declares that Amis deserves her better, and to\r\nAmis she is married, bearing however no good-will to Amiles for his\r\nresignation of her and for his firm hold on her husband's affection.\r\nMeanwhile, the daughter of Charles, Bellicent, conceives a violent\r\npassion for Amiles, and the traitor Hardre unfortunately becomes aware\r\nof the matter. He at once accuses Amiles of treason, and the knight is\r\ntoo conscious of the dubiousness of his cause to be very willing to\r\naccept the wager of battle. From this difficulty he is saved by Amis,\r\nwho comes to Paris from his distant seignory of Blaivies (Blaye), and\r\nfights the battle in the name and armour of his friend, while the latter\r\ngoes to Blaye and plays the part of his preserver. Both ventures are\r\nmade easier by the extraordinary resemblance of the pair. Amis is\r\nsuccessful; he slays Hardre, and then has no little difficulty in saving\r\nhimself from a forced marriage with Bellicent. This embroglio is\r\nsmoothed out, and Amiles and Bellicent are happily united. The generous\r\nAmis however has not been able to avoid forswearing himself while\r\nplaying the part of Amiles; and this sin is punished, according to a\r\ndivine warning, by an attack of leprosy. His wife Lubias seizes the\r\nopportunity, procures a separation from him, and almost starves him, or\r\nwould do so but for two faithful servants and his little son. At last a\r\nmeans of cure is revealed to him. If Amiles and Bellicent will allow\r\ntheir two sons to be slain the blood will recover Amis of his leprosy.\r\nThe stricken knight journeys painfully to his friend and tells him the\r\nhard condition. Amiles does not hesitate, and the following passage\r\ntells his deed:--\r\n\r\n      Li cuens Amiles un petit s'atarja,\r\n    vers les anfans pas por pas en ala,\r\n    dormans les treuve, moult par les resgarda,\r\n    s'espee lieve, ocirre les voldra;\r\n    mais de ferir un petit se tarja.\r\n    li ainznes freres de l'effroi s'esveilla\r\n    que li cuens mainne qui en la chambre entra,\r\n    l'anfes se torne, son pere ravisa,\r\n    s'espee voit, moult grant paor en a,\r\n    son pere apelle, si l'en arraisonna:\r\n    'biax sire peres, por deu qui tout forma,\r\n    que volez faire? nel me celez vos ja.\r\n    ainz mais nus peres tel chose ne pensa.'\r\n    'biaux sire fiuls, ocirre vos voil ja\r\n    et le tien frere qui delez toi esta;\r\n    car mes compains Amis qui moult m'ama,\r\n    dou sanc de vos li siens cors garistra,\r\n    que gietez est dou siecle.'\r\n      'Biax tres douz peres,' dist l'anfes erramment,\r\n    'quant vos compains avra garissement,\r\n    se de nos sans a sor soi lavement,\r\n    nos sommes vostre de vostre engenrement,\r\n    faire en poez del tout a vo talent.\r\n    or nos copez les chies isnellement;\r\n    car dex de glorie nos avra en present,\r\n    en paradis en irommes chantant\r\n    et proierommes Jhesu cui tout apent\r\n    que dou pechie vos face tensement,\r\n    vos et Ami, vostre compaingnon gent;\r\n    mais nostre mere, la bele Belissant,\r\n    nos saluez por deu omnipotent.'\r\n    li cuens l'oit, moult grans pities l'en prent\r\n    que touz pasmez a la terre s'estent.\r\n    quant se redresce, si reprinst hardement.\r\n    or orroiz ja merveilles, bonne gent,\r\n    que tex n'oistes en tout vostre vivant.\r\n    li cuens Amiles vint vers le lit esrant,\r\n    hauce l'espee, li fiuls le col estent.\r\n    or est merveilles se li cuers ne li ment.\r\n    la teste cope li peres son anfant,\r\n    le sanc reciut et cler bacin d'argent:\r\n    a poi ne chiet a terre.\r\n\r\nNo sooner has the blood touched Amis than he is cured, and the knights\r\nsolemnly visit the church where Bellicent and the people are assembled.\r\nThe story is told and the mother, in despair, rushes to the chamber\r\nwhere her dead children are lying. But she finds them living and in full\r\nhealth, for a miracle has been wrought to reward the faithfulness of the\r\nfriends now that suffering has purged them of their sin.\r\n\r\nThis story, touching in itself, is most touchingly told in the Chanson.\r\nNo poem of the kind is more vivid in description, or fuller of details\r\nof the manners of the time, than _Amis et Amiles_. Bellicent and Lubias,\r\nthe former passionate and impulsive but loving and faithful, the latter\r\ntreacherous, revengeful, and cold-hearted, give perhaps the earliest\r\nfinished portraits of feminine character to be found in French\r\nliterature. Amis and Amiles themselves are presented to us under so many\r\nmore aspects than Roland and Oliver that they dwell better in the\r\nmemory. The undercurrent of savagery which distinguished mediaeval times,\r\nand the rapid changes of fortune which were possible therein, are also\r\nwell brought out. Not even the immolation of Ganelon's hostages is so\r\nstriking as the calm ferocity with which Charlemagne dooms his wife and\r\nson as well as his daughter to pay with their lives the penalty of\r\nBellicent's fault; while the sudden lapse of Amis from his position of\r\nfeudal lordship at Blaye to that of a miserable outcast, smitten and\r\nmarked out for public scorn and ill-treatment by the visitation of God,\r\nis unusually dramatic. _Amis et Amiles_ bears to _Roland_ something not\r\nat all unlike the relation of the Odyssey to the Iliad. Its\r\ncontinuation, _Jourdains de Blaivies_, adds the element of foreign\r\ntravel and adventure; but that element is perhaps more\r\ncharacteristically represented, and the representation has certainly\r\nbeen more generally popular, in _Huon de Bordeaux_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other principal Chansons.]\r\n\r\nOf the remaining Chansons, the following are the most remarkable.\r\n_Aliscans_ (twelfth century) deals with the contest between William of\r\nOrange, the great Christian hero of the south of France, and the\r\nSaracens. This poem forms, according to custom, the centre of a whole\r\ngroup of Chansons dealing with the earlier and later adventures of the\r\nhero, his ancestors, and descendants. Such are _Le Couronnement Loys_,\r\n_La Prise d'Orange_, _Le Charroi de Nimes_, _Le Moniage Guillaume_. The\r\nseries formed by these and others[22] is among the most interesting of\r\nthese groups. _Le Chevalier au Cygne_ is a title applied directly to a\r\nsomewhat late version of an old folk-tale, and more generally to a\r\nseries of poems connected with the House of Bouillon and the Crusades.\r\nThe members of this bear the separate headings _Antioche_[23], _Les\r\nChetifs_, _Les Enfances Godefroy_, etc. _Antioche_, the first of these,\r\nwhich describes the exploits of the Christian host, first in attacking\r\nand then in defending that city, is one of the finest of the Chansons,\r\nand is probably in its original form not much later than the events it\r\ndescribes, being written by an eye-witness. The variety of its\r\npersonages, the vivid picture of the alternations of fortune, the vigour\r\nof the verse, are all remarkable. This group is terminated by _Baudouin\r\nde Sebourc_[24], a very late but very important Chanson, which falls in\r\nwith the poetry of the fourteenth century, and the _Bastart de\r\nBouillon_[25]. _La Chevalerie Ogier de Danemarche_[26] is the oldest\r\nform in which the adventures of one of the most popular and romantic of\r\nCharlemagne's heroes are related. _Fierabras_ had also a very wide\r\npopularity, and contains some of the liveliest pictures of manners to be\r\nfound in these poems, in its description of the rough horse-play of the\r\nknights and the unfilial behaviour of the converted Saracen princess.\r\nThis poem is also of much interest philologically[27]. _Garin le\r\nLoherain_[28] is the centre of a remarkable group dealing not directly\r\nwith Charlemagne, but with the provincial disputes and feuds of the\r\nnobility of Lorraine. _Raoul de Cambrai_[29] is another of the Chansons\r\nwhich deal with 'minor houses,' as they are called, in contradistinction\r\nto the main Carlovingian cycle. _Gerard de Roussillon_[30] ranks as a\r\npoem with the best of all the Chansons. _Hugues Capet_[31], though very\r\nlate, is attractive by reason of the glimpses it gives us of a new\r\nspirit supplanting that of chivalry proper. In it the heroic distinctly\r\ngives place to the burlesque. _Macaire_[32], besides being written in a\r\nsingular dialect, in which French is mingled with Italian, supplies the\r\noriginal of the well-known dog of Montargis. _Huon de Bordeaux_[33],\r\nalready mentioned, was not only more than usually popular at the time of\r\nits appearance, but has supplied Shakespeare with some of the dramatis\r\npersonae of _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, and Wieland and Weber with the\r\nplot of a well-known poem and opera. _Jourdains de Blaivies_, the sequel\r\nto _Amis et Amiles_, contains, besides much other interesting matter,\r\nthe incident which forms the centre of the plot of _Pericles_. _Les\r\nQuatre Fils Aymon_ or _Renaut de Montauban_[34] is the foundation of one\r\nof the most popular French chap-books. _Les Saisnes_[35] deals with\r\nCharlemagne's wars with Witekind. _Berte aus grans Pies_[36] is a very\r\ngraceful story of womanly innocence. _Doon de Mayence_[37], though not\r\nearly, includes a charming love-episode. _Gerard de Viane_[38] contains\r\nthe famous battle of Roland and Oliver. The _Voyage de Charlemagne a\r\nConstantinople_[39] is semi-burlesque in tone and one of the earliest in\r\nwhich that tone is perceptible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social and Literary Characteristics.]\r\n\r\nIn these numerous poems there is recognisable in the first place a\r\ndistinct family likeness which is common to the earliest and latest, and\r\nin the second, the natural difference of manners which the lapse of\r\nthree hundred years might be expected to occasion. There is a sameness\r\nwhich almost amounts to monotony in the plot of most Chansons de Gestes:\r\nthe hero is almost always either falsely accused of some crime, or else\r\ntreacherously exposed to the attacks of Saracens, or of his own\r\ncountrymen. The agents of this treachery are commonly of the blood of\r\nthe arch-traitor Ganelon, and are almost invariably discomfited by the\r\ngood knight or his friends and avengers. The part[40] which Charlemagne\r\nplays in these poems is not usually dignified: he is represented as\r\neasily gulled, capricious, and almost ferocious in temper, ungrateful,\r\nand ready to accept bribes and gifts. His good angel is always Duke\r\nNaimes of Bavaria, the Nestor of the Carlovingian epic. In the earliest\r\nChansons the part played by women is not so conspicuous as in the later,\r\nbut in all except _Roland_ it has considerable prominence. Sometimes the\r\nheroine is the wife, daughter, or niece of Charlemagne, sometimes a\r\nSaracen princess. But in either case she is apt to respond without much\r\ndelay to the hero's advances, which, indeed, she sometimes anticipates.\r\nThe conduct of knights to their ladies is also far from being what we\r\nnow consider chivalrous. Blows are very common, and seem to be taken by\r\nthe weaker sex as matters of course. The prevailing legal forms are\r\nsimple and rather sanguinary. The judgment of God, as shown by ordeal of\r\nbattle, settles all disputes; but battle is not permitted unless several\r\nnobles of weight and substance come forward as sponsors for each\r\nchampion; and sponsors as well as principal risk their lives in case of\r\nthe principal's defeat, unless they can tempt the king's cupidity. These\r\ncommon features are necessarily in the case of so large a number of\r\npoems mixed with much individual difference, nor are the Chansons by any\r\nmeans monotonous reading. Their versification is pleasing to the ear,\r\nand their language, considering its age, is of surprising strength,\r\nexpressiveness, and even wealth. Though they lack the variety, the\r\npathos, the romantic chivalry, and the mystical attractions of the\r\nArthurian romances, there is little doubt that they paint, far more\r\naccurately than their successors, an actually existing state of society,\r\nthat which prevailed in the palmy time of the feudal system, when war\r\nand religion were deemed the sole subjects worthy to occupy seriously\r\nmen of station and birth. In giving utterance to this warlike and\r\nreligious sentiment, few periods and classes of literature have been\r\nmore strikingly successful. Nowhere is the mere fury of battle better\r\nrendered than in _Roland_ and _Fierabras_. Nowhere is the valiant\r\nindignation of the beaten warrior, and, at the same time, his humble\r\nsubmission to providence, better given than in _Aliscans_. Nowhere do we\r\nfind the mediaeval spirit of feudal enmity and private war more\r\nstrikingly depicted than in the cycle of the Lorrainers, and in _Raoul\r\nde Cambrai_. Nowhere is the devout sentiment and belief of the same time\r\nmore fully drawn than in _Amis et Amiles_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Authorship.]\r\n\r\nThe method of composition and publication of these poems was peculiar.\r\nOrdinarily, though not always, they were composed by the Trouvere, and\r\nperformed by the Jongleur. Sometimes the Trouvere condescended to\r\nperformance, and sometimes the Jongleur aspired to composition, but not\r\nusually. The poet was commonly a man of priestly or knightly rank, the\r\nperformer (who might be of either sex) was probably of no particular\r\nstation. The Jongleur, or Jongleresse, wandered from castle to castle,\r\nreciting the poems, and interpolating in them recommendations of the\r\nquality of the wares, requests to the audience to be silent, and often\r\nappeals to their generosity. Some of the manuscripts which we now\r\npossess were originally used by Jongleurs, and it was only in this way\r\nthat the early Chanson de Geste was intended to be read. The process of\r\nhawking about naturally interfered with the preservation of the poems in\r\ntheir original purity, and even with the preservation of the author's\r\nname. In very few cases[41] is the latter known to us.\r\n\r\nThe question whether the Chansons de Gestes were originally written in\r\nnorthern or southern French has often been hotly debated. The facts are\r\nthese. Only three Chansons exist in Provencal. Two of these[42] are\r\nadmitted translations or imitations of Northern originals. The third,\r\n_Girartz de Rossilho_, is undoubtedly original, but is written in the\r\nnorthernmost dialect of the Southern tongue. The inference appears to be\r\nclear that the Chanson de Geste is properly a product of northern\r\nFrance. The opposite conclusion necessitates the supposition that either\r\nin the Albigensian war, or by some inexplicable concatenation of\r\naccidents, a body of original Provencal Chansons has been totally\r\ndestroyed, with all allusions to, and traditions of, these poems. Such a\r\nhypothesis is evidently unreasonable, and would probably never have been\r\nstarted had not some of the earliest students of Old French been\r\ncommitted by local feeling to the championship of the language of the\r\nTroubadours. On the other hand, almost all the dialects of Northern\r\nFrench are represented, Norman and Picard being perhaps the\r\ncommonest[43].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Style and Language.]\r\n\r\nThe language of these poems, as the extracts given will partly show, is\r\nneither poor in vocabulary, nor lacking in harmony of sound. It is\r\nindeed, more sonorous and stately than classical French language was\r\nfrom the seventeenth century to the days of Victor Hugo, and abounds in\r\npicturesque terms which have since dropped out of use. The massive\r\ncastles of the baronage, with their ranges of marble steps leading up to\r\nthe hall, where feasting is held by day and where the knights sleep at\r\nnight, are often described. Dress is mentioned with peculiar lavishness.\r\nPelisses of ermine, ornaments of gold and silver, silken underclothing,\r\nseem to give the poets special pleasure in recording them. In no\r\nlanguage are what have been called 'perpetual' epithets more usual,\r\nthough the abundance of the recurring phrases prevents monotony. The\r\n'clear countenances' of the ladies, the 'steely brands' of the knights,\r\ntheir 'marble palaces,' the 'flowing beard' of Charlemagne, the\r\n'guileful tongue' of the traitors, are constant features of the verbal\r\nlandscape. From so great a mass of poetry it would be vain in any space\r\nhere available to attempt to arrange specimen 'jewels five words long.'\r\nBut those who actually read the Chansons will be surprised at the\r\nabundance of fresh striking and poetic phrase.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Later History.]\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject of the Chansons de Gestes, it may be well to\r\ngive briefly their subsequent literary history. They were at first\r\nfrequently re-edited, the tendency always being to increase their\r\nlength, so that in some cases the latest versions extant run to thirty\r\nor forty thousand lines. As soon as this limit was reached, they began\r\nto be turned into prose, the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries being\r\nthe special period of this change. The art of printing came in time to\r\nassist the spread of these prose versions, and for some centuries they\r\nwere almost the only form in which the Chansons de Gestes, under the\r\ngeneral title of romances of chivalry, were known. The verse originals\r\nremained for the most part in manuscript, but the prose romances gained\r\nan enduring circulation among the peasantry in France. From the\r\nseventeenth century their vogue was mainly restricted to this class. But\r\nin the middle of the eighteenth the Comte de Tressan was induced to\r\nattempt their revival for the _Bibliotheque des Romans_. His versions\r\nwere executed entirely in the spirit of the day, and did not render any\r\nof the characteristic features of the old Epics. But they drew attention\r\nto them, and by the end of the century, University Professors began to\r\nlecture on old French poetry. The exertions of M. Paulin Paris, of M.\r\nFrancisque Michel, and of some German scholars first brought about the\r\nre-editing of the Chansons in their original form about half a century\r\nago; and since that time they have received steady attention, and a\r\nlarge number have been published--a number to which additions are yearly\r\nbeing made. Rather more than half the known total are now in print.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] _Gesta_ or _Geste_ has three senses: (_a_) the _deeds_ of a hero;\r\n(_b_) the _chronicle_ of those deeds; and (_c_) the _family_ which that\r\nchronicle illustrates. The three chief gestes are those of the King, of\r\nDoon de Mayence, and of Garin de Montglane. Each of these is composed of\r\nmany poems. Contrasted with these are the 'petites gestes,' which\r\ninclude only a few Chansons.\r\n\r\n[18] _La Chanson de Roland_, ed. Fr. Michel, Paris, 1837. The MS. is in\r\nthe Bodleian Library (Digby 23). Another, of much later date in point of\r\nwriting but representing the same text, exists at Venice. Of later\r\nversions there are six manuscripts extant. The Chanson de Roland has\r\nsince its _editio princeps_ been repeatedly re-edited, translated, and\r\ncommented. The most exact edition is that of Prof. Stengel, Heilbronn,\r\n1878, who has given the Bodleian Manuscript both in print and in\r\nphotographic facsimile. The best for general use is that of Leon Gautier\r\n(seventh edition), 1877.\r\n\r\n[19] Wace (Roman de Rou, iii. 8038 Andresen) speaks of the Norman\r\nTaillefer as singing at Hastings 'De Karlemaigne et de Rollant.' It has\r\nbeen sought, but perhaps fancifully, to identify this song with the\r\nexisting _chanson_.\r\n\r\n[20] 'Ci falt la geste que Turoldus declinet.' The sense of the word\r\n_declinet_ is quite uncertain, and the attempts made to identify\r\nTuroldus are futile.\r\n\r\n[21] _Amis et Amiles_, ed. Hoffmann. Erlangen, 1852.\r\n\r\n[22] This series is given, sometimes in whole, sometimes in extracts, by\r\nDr. Jonckbloet, _Guillaume d'Orange_. The Hague, 1854.\r\n\r\n[23] Ed. P. Paris.

Paris, 1842.\r\n\r\n[27] There exists a Provencal version of it, evidently translated from\r\nthe French. The most convenient edition is that of Kroeber and Servois,\r\nParis, 1860. There is an English fourteenth-century version published by\r\nMr. Herrtage for the Early English Text Society, 1879.\r\n\r\n[28] Published partially by MM. P. Paris and E. du Meril and by Herr\r\nStengel.\r\n\r\n[29] Ed. Le Glay. Paris, 1840.\r\n\r\n[30] Ed. Michel. Paris, 1856.\r\n\r\n[31] Ed. La Grange. Paris, 1864.\r\n\r\n[32] Ed. Guessard.

London, 1836.\r\n\r\n[40] It is very commonly said that this feature is confined to the later\r\nChansons. This is scarcely the fact, unless by 'later' we are to\r\nunderstand all except _Roland_. In _Roland_ itself the presentment is by\r\nno means wholly complimentary.\r\n\r\n[41] The Turoldus of _Roland_ has been already noticed. Of certain or\r\ntolerably certain authors, Graindor de Douai (revisions of the early\r\ncrusading Chansons of 'Richard the Pilgrim,' _Antioche_, &c.), Jean de\r\nFlagy (_Garin_), Bodel (_Les Saisnes_), and Adenes le Roi, a fertile\r\nauthor or adapter of the thirteenth century, are the most noted.\r\n\r\n[42] _Ferabras_ and _Betonnet d'Hanstone_. M. Paul Meyer has recently\r\nedited this latter poem under the title of _Daurel et Beton_ (Paris,\r\n1880). To these should be added a fragment, _Aigar et Maurin_, which\r\nseems to rank with _Girartz_.\r\n\r\n[43] There has been some reaction of late years against the scepticism\r\nwhich questioned the 'Provencal Epic.' I cannot however say, though I\r\nadmit a certain disqualification for judgment (see note at beginning of\r\nnext chapter), that I see any valid reason for this reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPROVENCAL LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Langue d'Oc.]\r\n\r\nThe Romance language, spoken in the country now called France, has two\r\ngreat divisions, the Langue d'Oc and the Langue d'Oil[44], which stand\r\nto one another in hardly more intimate relationship than the first of\r\nthem does to Spanish or Italian. In strictness, the Langue d'Oc ought\r\nnot to be called French at all, inasmuch as those who spoke it applied\r\nthat term exclusively to Northern speech, calling their own Limousin, or\r\nProvencal, or Auvergnat. At the time, moreover, when Provencal\r\nliterature flourished, the districts which contributed to it were in\r\nvery loose relationship with the kingdom of France; and when that\r\nrelationship was drawn tighter, Provencal literature began to wither and\r\ndie. Yet it is not possible to avoid giving some sketch of the literary\r\ndevelopments of Southern France in any history of French literature, as\r\nwell because of the connection which subsisted between the two branches,\r\nas because of the altogether mistaken views which have been not\r\nunfrequently held as to that connection. Lord Macaulay[45] speaks of\r\nProvencal in the twelfth century as 'the only one of the vernacular\r\nlanguages of Europe which had yet been extensively employed for literary\r\npurposes;' and the ignorance of their older literature which, until a\r\nvery recent period, distinguished Frenchmen has made it common for\r\nwriters in France to speak of the Troubadours as their own literary\r\nancestors. We have already seen that this supposition as applied to Epic\r\npoetry is entirely false; we shall see hereafter that, except as regards\r\nsome lyrical developments, and those not the most characteristic, it is\r\nequally ill-grounded as to other kinds of composition. But the\r\nliterature of the South is quite interesting enough in itself without\r\nborrowing what does not belong to it, and it exhibits not a few\r\ncharacteristics which were afterwards blended with those of the\r\nliterature of the kingdom at large.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Range and characteristics.]\r\n\r\nThe domain of the Langue d'Oc is included between two lines, the\r\nnorthernmost of which starts from the Atlantic coast at or about the\r\nCharente, follows the northern boundaries of the old provinces of\r\nPerigord, Limousin, Auvergne, and Dauphine, and overlaps Savoy and a\r\nsmall portion of Switzerland. The southern limit is formed by the\r\nPyrenees, the Gulf of Lyons, and the Alps, while Catalonia is overlapped\r\nto the south-west just as Savoy is taken in on the north-east. This wide\r\ndistrict gives room for not a few dialectic varieties with which we need\r\nnot here busy ourselves. The general language is distinguished from\r\nnorthern French by the survival to a greater degree of the vowel\r\ncharacter of Latin. The vocabulary is less dissolved and corroded by\r\nforeign influence, and the inflections remain more distinct. The result,\r\nas in Spanish and Italian, is a language more harmonious, softer, and\r\nmore cunningly cadenced than northern French, but endowed with far less\r\nvigour, variety, and freshness. The separate development of the two\r\ntongues must have begun at a very early period. A few early monuments,\r\nsuch as the Passion of Christ[46] and the Mystery of the Ten\r\nVirgins[47], contain mixed dialects. But the earliest piece of\r\nliterature in pure Provencal is assigned in its original form to the\r\ntenth century, and is entirely different from northern French[48]. It is\r\narranged in _laisses_ and assonanced. The uniformity, however, of the\r\nterminations of Provencal makes the assonances more closely approach\r\nrhyme than is the case in northern poetry. Of the eleventh century the\r\nprincipal monuments are a few charters, a translation of part of St.\r\nJohn's Gospel, and several religious pieces in prose and verse. Not\r\ntill the extreme end of this century does the Troubadour begin to make\r\nhimself heard. The earliest of these minstrels whose songs we possess is\r\nWilliam IX, Count of Poitiers. With him Provencal literature, properly\r\nso called, begins.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Periods of Provencal Literature.]\r\n\r\nThe admirable historian of Provencal literature, Karl Bartsch, divides\r\nits products into three periods; the first reaching to the end of the\r\neleventh century, and comprising the beginnings and experiments of the\r\nlanguage as a literary medium; the second covering the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries, the most flourishing time of the Troubadour\r\npoetry, and possessing also specimens of many other forms of literary\r\ncomposition; the third, the period of decadence, including the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and remarkable chiefly for some\r\nreligious literature, and for the contests of the Toulouse school of\r\npoets. In a complete history of Provencal literature notice would also\r\nhave to be taken of the fitful and spasmodic attempts of the last four\r\ncenturies to restore the dialect to the rank of a literary language,\r\nattempts which have never been made with greater energy and success than\r\nin our own time[49], but which hardly call for notice here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First Period.]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable works of the first period have been already alluded\r\nto. This period may possibly have produced original epics of the Chanson\r\nform, though, as has been pointed out, no indications of any such exist,\r\nexcept in the solitary instance of _Girartz de Rossilho_. The important\r\npoem of Auberi of Besancon on Alexander is lost, except the first\r\nhundred verses. It is thought to be the oldest vernacular poem on the\r\nsubject, and is in a mixed dialect partaking of the forms both of north\r\nand south. Hymns, sometimes in mixed Latin and Provencal, sometimes\r\nentirely in the latter, are found early. A single prose monument remains\r\nin the shape of a fragmentary translation of the Gospel of St. John. But\r\nby far the most important example of this period is the _Boethius_. The\r\npoem, as we have it, extends to 238 decasyllabic verses arranged on the\r\nfashion of a Chanson de Geste, and dates from the eleventh century, or\r\nat latest from the beginning of the twelfth, but is thought to be a\r\nrehandling of another poem which may have been written nearly two\r\ncenturies earlier. The narrative part of the work is a mere\r\nintroduction, the bulk of it consisting of moral reflections taken from\r\nthe _De Consolatione_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Period.]\r\n\r\nIt is only in the second period that Provencal literature becomes of\r\nreal importance. The stimulus which brought it to perfection has been\r\ngenerally taken to be that of the crusades, aided by the great\r\ndevelopment of peaceful civilisation at home which Provence and\r\nLanguedoc then saw. The spirit of chivalry rose and was diffused all\r\nover Europe at this time, and in some of its aspects it received a\r\ngreater welcome in Provence than anywhere else. For the mystical, the\r\nadventurous, and other sides of the chivalrous character, we must look\r\nto the North, and especially to the Arthurian legends, and the Romans\r\nd'Aventures which they influenced. But, for what has been well called\r\n'la passion souveraine, aveugle, idolatre, qui eclipse tous les autres\r\nsentiments, qui dedaigne tous les devoirs, qui se moque de l'enfer et du\r\nciel, qui absorbe et possede l'ame entiere[50],' we must come to the\r\nliterature of the south of France. Passion is indeed not the only motive\r\nof the Troubadours, but it is their favourite motive, and their most\r\nsuccessful. The connection of this predominant instinct with the\r\nelaborate and unmatched attention to form which characterises them is a\r\npsychological question very interesting to discuss, but hardly suitable\r\nto these pages. It is sufficient here to say that these various motives\r\nand influences produced the Troubadours and their literature. This\r\nliterature was chiefly lyrical in form, but also included many other\r\nkinds, of which a short account may be given.\r\n\r\n_Girartz de Rossilho_ belongs in all probability to the earliest years\r\nof the period, though the only Provencal manuscript in existence dates\r\nfrom the end of the thirteenth century. In the third decade of the\r\ntwelfth Guillem Bechada had written a poem on the conquest of Jerusalem\r\nby the Crusaders, which, however, has perished, though the northern\r\ncycle of the Chevalier au Cygne may represent it in part. Guillem of\r\nPoitiers also wrote a historical poem on the Crusades with similar ill\r\nfate. But the most famous of historical poems in Provencal has\r\nfortunately been preserved to us. This is the chronicle of the\r\nAlbigensian War, written in Alexandrines by William of Tudela and an\r\nanonymous writer. We also possess a rhymed chronicle of the war of\r\n1276-77 in Navarre, by Guillem Anelier. In connection with the Arthurian\r\ncycle there exists a Provencal Roman d'Aventures, entitled _Jaufre_. The\r\ntestimony of Wolfram von Eschenbach would appear to be decisive as to\r\nthe existence of a Provencal continuation of Chrestien's _Percevale_ by\r\na certain Kiot or Guyot, but nothing more is known of this. _Blandin de\r\nCornoalha_ is another existing romance, and so is the far more\r\ninteresting _Flamenca_, a lively picture of manners dating from the\r\nmiddle of the thirteenth century. In shorter and slighter narrative\r\npoems Provencal is still less fruitful, though Raimon Vidal, Arnaut de\r\nZurcasses, and one or two other writers have left work of this kind. A\r\nvery few narrative poems of a sacred character are also found, and\r\nvestiges of drama may be traced. But, as we have said, the real\r\nimportance of the period consists in its lyrical poetry, the poetry of\r\nthe Troubadours. The names of 460 separate poets are given, and 251\r\npieces have come down to us without the names of their writers. We have\r\nhere no space for dwelling on individual persons; it is sufficient to\r\nmention as the most celebrated Arnaut Daniel, Bernart de Ventadorn,\r\nBertran de Born, Cercamon, Folquet de Marseilha, Gaucelm Faidit, Guillem\r\nof Poitiers, Guillem de Cabestanh, Guiraut de Borneilh, Guiraut Riquier,\r\nJaufre Rudel, Marcabrun, Peire Cardenal, Peire Vidal, Peirol, Raimbaut\r\nde Vaqueiras, Sordel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Forms of Troubadour Poetry.]\r\n\r\nThe chief forms in which these poets exercised their ingenuity were as\r\nfollows. The simplest and oldest was called simply _vers_; it had few\r\nartificial rules, was written in octosyllabic lines, and arranged in\r\nstanzas. From this was developed the _canso_, the most usual of\r\nProvencal forms. Here the rhymes were interlaced, and the alternation of\r\nmasculine and feminine by degrees observed. The length of the lines\r\nvaried. Both these forms were consecrated to love verse; the Sirvente,\r\non the other hand, is panegyrical or satirical, its meaning being\r\nliterally 'Song of Service.' It consisted for the most part of short\r\nstanzas, simply rhyme, and corresponding exactly to one another. The\r\n_planh_ or Complaint was a dirge or funeral song written generally in\r\ndecasyllabics. The _tenson_ or debate is in dialogue form, and when\r\nthere are more than two disputants is called _torneijamens_. The\r\nnarrative Romance existed in Provencal as well as the _balada_ or\r\nthree-stanza poem, usually with refrain. The _retroensa_ is a longer\r\nrefrain poem of later date, but in neither is the return of the same\r\nrhyme in each stanza necessarily observed, as in the French _ballade_.\r\nThe _alba_ is a leave-taking poem at morning, and the _serena_ (if it\r\ncan be called a form, for scarcely more than a single example exists) a\r\npoem of remembrance and longing at eventide. The _pastorela_, which had\r\nnumerous sub-divisions, explains itself. The _descort_ is a poem\r\nsomething like the irregular ode, which varies the structure of its\r\nstanzas. The _sextine_, in six stanzas of identical and complicated\r\nversification, is the stateliest of all Provencal forms. Not merely the\r\nrhymes but the words which rhyme are repeated on a regular scheme. The\r\n_breu-doble_ (double-short) is a curious little form on three rhymes,\r\ntwo of which are repeated twice in three four-lined stanzas, and given\r\nonce in a concluding couplet, while the third finishes each quatrain.\r\nOther forms are often mentioned and given, but they are not of much\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nThe prose of the best period of Provencal literature is of little\r\nimportance. Its most considerable remains, besides religious works and a\r\nfew scientific and grammatical treatises, are a prose version of the\r\n_Chanson des Albigeois_, and an interesting collection of contemporary\r\nlives of the Troubadours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Third Period.]\r\n\r\nThe productiveness of the last two centuries of Provencal literature\r\nproper has been spoken of by the highest living authority as at most an\r\naftermath. At the beginning of the fourteenth century, Arnaut Vidal\r\nwrote a Roman d'Aventures entitled _Guillem de la Barra_. This poet,\r\nlike most of the other literary names of the period, belongs to the\r\nschool of Toulouse, a somewhat artificial band of writers who flourished\r\nthroughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, held poetical\r\ntournaments on the first Sunday in May, invented or adopted the famous\r\nphrase _gai saber_ for their pursuits, and received, if they were\r\nsuccessful, the equally famous Golden Violet and minor trinkets of the\r\nsame sort. The brotherhood directed itself by an art of poetry in which\r\nthe half-forgotten traditions of more spontaneous times were gathered\r\nup.\r\n\r\nTo this period, and to its latter part, the Waldensian writings entitled\r\n_La Nobla Leyczon_, to which ignorance and sectarian enthusiasm had\r\ngiven a much earlier date, are now assigned. There is also a\r\nconsiderable mass of miscellaneous literature, but nothing of great\r\nvalue, or having much to do with the only point which is here of\r\nimportance, the distinctive character of Provencal literature, and the\r\ninfluence of that literature upon the development of letters in France\r\ngenerally. With a few words on these two points this chapter may be\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Literary Relation of Provencal and French.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defects of Provencal Literature.]\r\n\r\nIt may be regarded as not proven that any initial influence was\r\nexercised over northern French literature by the literature of the\r\nSouth, and more than this, it may be held to be unlikely that any such\r\ninfluence was exerted. For in the first place all the more important\r\ndevelopments of the latter, the Epic, the Drama, the Fabliau, are\r\ndistinctly of northern birth, and either do not exist in Provencal at\r\nall, or exist for the most part as imitations of northern originals.\r\nWith regard to lyric poetry the case is rather different. The earliest\r\nexisting lyrics of the North are somewhat later than the earliest songs\r\nof the Troubadours, and no great lyrical variety or elegance is reached\r\nuntil the Troubadours' work had, by means of Thibaut de Champagne and\r\nothers, had an opportunity of penetrating into northern France. On the\r\nother hand, the forms which finished lyric adopted in the North are by\r\nno means identical with those of the Troubadours. The scientific and\r\nmelodious figures of the Ballade, the Rondeau, the Chant-royal, the\r\nRondel, and the Villanelle, cannot by any ingenuity be deduced from\r\nCanso or Balada, Retroensa or Breu-Doble. The Alba and the Pastorela\r\nagree in subject with the Aubade and the Pastourelle, but have no\r\nnecessary or obvious connection of form. It would, however, be almost as\r\ngreat a mistake to deny the influence of the spirit of Provencal\r\nliterature over French, as to regard the two as standing in the\r\nposition of mother and daughter. The Troubadours undoubtedly preceded\r\ntheir Northern brethren in scrupulous attention to poetical form, and in\r\nelaborate devices for ensuring such attention. They preceded them too in\r\nrecognising that quality in poetry for which there is perhaps no other\r\nword than elegance. There can be little doubt that they sacrificed to\r\nthese two divinities, elegance and the formal limitation of verse,\r\nmatters almost equally if not more important. The motives of their poems\r\nare few, and the treatment of those motives monotonous. Love, war, and\r\npersonal enmity, with a certain amount of more or less frigid didactics,\r\nalmost complete the list. In dealing with the first and the most\r\nfruitful, they fell into the deadly error of stereotyping their manner\r\nof expression. Objection has sometimes been taken to the 'eternal\r\nhawthorn and nightingale' of Provencal poetry. The objection would\r\nhardly be fatal, if this eternity did not extend to a great many things\r\nbesides hawthorn and nightingales. In the later Troubadours especially,\r\nthe fault which has been urged against French dramatic literature just\r\nbefore the Romantic movement was conspicuously anticipated. Every mood,\r\nevery situation of passion, was catalogued and analysed, and the proper\r\nmethod of treatment, with similes and metaphors complete, was assigned.\r\nThere was no freshness and no variety, and in the absence of variety and\r\nfreshness, that of vigour was necessarily implied. It may even be\r\ndoubted whether the influence of this hot-house verse on the more\r\nnatural literature of the North was not injurious rather than\r\nbeneficial. Certain it is that the artificial poetry of the Trouveres\r\nwent (in the persons of the Rondeau and Ballade-writing Rhetoriqueurs of\r\nthe fifteenth century) the same way and came to the same end, that its\r\nelder sister had already trodden and reached with the competitors for\r\nthe Violet, the Eglantine, and the Marigold of Toulouse.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] _Oc_ and _oil_ (_hoc_ and _hoc illud_), the respective terms\r\nindicating affirmation.

Its Origins.]\r\n\r\nThe passion for narrative poetry, which at first contented itself with\r\nstories drawn from the history or tradition of France, took before very\r\nlong a wider range. The origin of the Legend of King Arthur, of the\r\nRound Table, of the Holy Graal, and of all the adventures and traditions\r\nconnected with these centres, is one of the most intricate questions in\r\nthe history of mediaeval literature. It would be beyond the scope of\r\nthis book to attempt to deal with it at length. It is sufficient for our\r\npurpose, in the first place, to point out that the question of the\r\nactual existence and acts of Arthur has very little to do with the\r\nquestion of the origin of the Arthurian cycle. The history of mediaeval\r\nliterature, as distinguished from the history of the Middle Ages, need\r\nnot concern itself with any conflict between the invaders and the older\r\ninhabitants of England. The question which is of historical literary\r\ninterest is, whether the traditions which Geoffrey of Monmouth, Walter\r\nMap, Chrestien de Troyes, and their followers, wrought into a fabric of\r\nsuch astounding extent and complexity, are due to Breton originals, or\r\nwhether their authority is nothing but the ingenuity of Geoffrey working\r\nupon the meagre data of Nennius[51]. As far as this question concerns\r\nFrench literature, the chief champions of these rival opinions were till\r\nlately M. de la Villemarque and M. Paulin Paris. In no instance was the\r\nformer able to produce Breton or Celtic originals of early date. On the\r\nother hand, M. Paris showed that Nennius is sufficient to account for\r\nGeoffrey, and that Geoffrey is sufficient to account for the purely\r\nArthurian part of subsequent romances and chronicles. The religious\r\nelement of the cycle has a different origin, and may possibly not be\r\nCeltic at all. Lastly, we must take into account a large body of Breton\r\nand Welsh poetry from which, especially in the parts of the legend which\r\ndeal with Tristram, with King Mark, &c., amplifications have been\r\ndevised. It must, however, still be admitted that the extraordinary\r\nrapidity with which so vast a growth of literature was produced,\r\napparently from the slenderest stock, is one of the most surprising\r\nthings in literary history. Before the middle of the twelfth century\r\nlittle or nothing is heard of Arthur. Before that century closed at\r\nleast a dozen poems and romances in prose, many of them of great length,\r\nhad elaborated the whole legend as it was thenceforward received, and as\r\nwe have it condensed and Englished in Malory's well-known book two\r\ncenturies and a half later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Order of French Arthurian Cycle.]\r\n\r\nThe probable genesis of the Arthurian legend, in so far as it concerns\r\nFrench literature, appears to be as follows. First in order of\r\ncomposition, and also in order of thought, comes the Legend of Joseph of\r\nArimathea, sometimes called the 'Little St. Graal.' This we have both in\r\nverse and prose, and one or both of these versions is the work of Robert\r\nde Borron, a knight and _trouvere_ possessed of lands in the\r\nGatinais[52]. There is nothing in this work which is directly connected\r\nwith Arthur. By some it has been attributed to a Latin, but not now\r\nproducible, 'Book of the Graal,' by others to Byzantine originals.\r\nAnyhow it fell into the hands of the well-known Walter Map[53], and his\r\nexhaustless energy and invention at once seized upon it. He produced the\r\n'Great St. Graal,' a very much extended version of the early history of\r\nthe sacred vase, still keeping clear of definite connection with Arthur,\r\nthough tending in that direction. From this, in its turn, sprang the\r\noriginal form of _Percevale_, which represents a quest for the vessel\r\nby a knight who has not originally anything to do with the Round Table.\r\nThe link of connection between the two stories is to be found in the\r\n_Merlin_, attributed also to Robert de Borron, wherein the Welsh legends\r\nbegin to have more definite influence. This, in its turn, leads to\r\n_Artus_, which gives the early history of the great king. Then comes the\r\nmost famous, most extensive, and finest of all the romances, that of\r\n_Lancelot du Lac_, which is pretty certainly in part, and perhaps in\r\ngreat part, the work of Map; as is also the mystical and melancholy but\r\nhighly poetical _Quest of the Saint Graal_, a quest of which Galahad and\r\nLancelot, not, as in the earlier legends, Percival, are the heroes. To\r\nthis succeeds the _Mort Artus_, which forms the conclusion of the whole,\r\nproperly speaking. This, however, does not entirely complete the cycle.\r\nLater than Borron, Map, and their unknown fellow-workers (if such they\r\nhad), arose one or more _trouveres_, who worked up the ancient Celtic\r\nlegends and lays of Tristram into the Romance of _Tristan_, connecting\r\nthis, more or less clumsily, with the main legend of the Round Table.\r\nOther legends were worked up into the _omnium gatherum_ of _Giron le\r\nCourtois_, and with this the cycle proper ceases. The later poems are\r\nattributed to two persons, called Luce de Gast and Helie de Borron. But\r\nnot the slightest testimony can be adduced to show that any such persons\r\never had existence[54].\r\n\r\nThese prose romances form for the most part the original literature of\r\nthe Arthurian story. But the vogue of this story was very largely\r\nincreased by a _trouvere_ who used not prose but octosyllabic verse for\r\nhis medium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chrestien de Troyes.]\r\n\r\nAs is the case with most of these early writers, little or nothing is\r\nknown of Chrestien de Troyes but his name. He lived in the last half of\r\nthe twelfth century, he was attached to the courts of Flanders,\r\nHainault, and Champagne, and he wrote most of his works for the lords of\r\nthese fiefs. Besides his Arthurian work he translated Ovid, and wrote\r\nsome short poems. Chrestien de Troyes deserves a higher place in\r\nliterature than has sometimes been given to him. His versification is so\r\nexceedingly easy and fluent as to appear almost pedestrian at times; and\r\nhis _Chevalier a la Charrette_, by which he is perhaps most generally\r\nknown, contrasts unfavourably in its prolixity with the nervous and\r\npicturesque prose to which it corresponds. But _Percevale_ and the\r\n_Chevalier au Lyon_ are very charming poems, deeply imbued with the\r\npeculiar characteristics of the cycle--religious mysticism, passionate\r\ngallantry, and refined courtesy of manners. Chrestien de Troyes\r\nundoubtedly contributed not a little to the popularity of the Arthurian\r\nlegends. Although, by a singular chance, which has not yet been fully\r\nexplained, the originals appear to have been for the most part in\r\nprose, the times were by no means ripe for the general enjoyment of work\r\nin such a form. The reciter was still the general if not the only\r\npublisher, and recitation almost of necessity implied poetical form.\r\nChrestien did not throw the whole of the work of his contemporaries into\r\nverse, but he did so throw a considerable portion of it. His Arthurian\r\nworks consist of _Le Chevalier a la Charrette_, a very close rendering\r\nof an episode of Map's _Lancelot_; _Le Chevalier au Lyon_, resting\r\nprobably upon some previous work not now in existence; _Erec et Enide_,\r\nthe legend which every English reader knows in Mr. Tennyson's _Enid_,\r\nand which seems to be purely Welsh; _Cliges_, which may be called the\r\nfirst Roman d'Aventures; and lastly, _Percevale_, a work of vast extent,\r\ncontinued by successive versifiers to the extent of some fifty thousand\r\nlines, and probably representing in part a work of Robert de Borron,\r\nwhich has only recently been printed by M. Hucher. _Percevale_ is,\r\nperhaps, the best example of Chrestien's fashion of composition. The\r\nwork of Borron is very short, amounting in all to some ninety pages in\r\nthe reprint. The _Percevale le Gallois_ of Chrestien and his\r\ncontinuators, on the other hand, contains, as has been said, more than\r\nforty-five thousand verses. This amplification is produced partly by the\r\nimportation of incidents and episodes from other works, but still more\r\nby indulging in constant diffuseness and what we must perhaps call\r\ncommonplaces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spirit and Literary value of Arthurian Romances.]\r\n\r\nFrom a literary point of view the prose romances rank far higher,\r\nespecially those in which Map is known or suspected to have had a hand.\r\nThe peculiarity of what may be called their atmosphere is marked. An\r\nelaborate and romantic system of mystical religious sentiment, finding\r\nvent in imaginative and allegorical narrative, a remarkable refinement\r\nof manners, and a combination of delight in battle with devotion to\r\nladies, distinguish them. This is, in short, the romantic spirit, or, as\r\nit is sometimes called, the spirit of chivalry; and it cannot be too\r\npositively asserted that the Arthurian romances communicate it to\r\nliterature for the first time, and that nothing like it is found in the\r\nclassics. In the work of Map and his contemporaries it is clearly\r\nperceivable. The most important element in this--courtesy--is, as we\r\nhave already noticed, almost entirely absent from the Chansons de\r\nGestes, and where it is present at all it is between persons who are\r\nconnected by some natural or artificial relation of comradeship or kin.\r\nNor are there many traces of it in such fragments and indications as we\r\npossess of the Celtic originals, which may have helped in the production\r\nof the Arthurian romances. No Carlovingian knight would have felt the\r\nhorror of Sir Bors when the Lady of Hungerford exercises her undoubted\r\nright by flinging the body of her captive enemy on the camp of his\r\nuncle. Even the chiefs who are presented in the _Chanson d'Antioche_ as\r\njoking over the cannibal banquet of the Roi des Tafurs, and permitting\r\nthe dead bodies of Saracens to be torn from the cemeteries and flung\r\ninto the beleaguered city, would have very much applauded the deed.\r\nGallantry, again, is as much absent from the Chansons as clemency and\r\ncourtesy. The scene in _Lancelot_, where Galahault first introduces the\r\nQueen and Lancelot to one another, contrasts in the strongest manner\r\nwith the downright courtship by which the Bellicents and Nicolettes of\r\nthe Carlovingian cycle are won. No doubt Map represents to a great\r\nextent the sentiments of the polished court of England. But he deserves\r\nthe credit of having been the first, or almost the first, to express\r\nsuch manners and sentiments, perhaps also of having being among the\r\nfirst to conceive them.\r\n\r\nThese originals are not all equally represented in Malory's English\r\ncompilation. Of Robert de Borron's work little survives except by\r\nallusion. _Lancelot du Lac_ itself, the most popular of all the\r\nromances, is very disproportionately drawn upon. Of the youth of\r\nLancelot, of the winning of Dolorous Gard, of the war with the Saxons,\r\nand of the very curious episode of the false Guinevere, there is\r\nnothing; while the most charming story of Lancelot's relations with\r\nGalahault of Sorelois disappears, except in a few passing allusions to\r\nthe 'haughty prince.' On the other hand, the _Quest of the Saint Graal_,\r\nthe _Mort Artus_, some episodes of _Lancelot_ (such as the _Chevalier a\r\nla Charrette_), and many parts of _Tristan_ and _Giron le Courtois_, are\r\ngiven almost in full.\r\n\r\nIt seems also probable that considerable portions of the original form\r\nof the Arthurian legends are as yet unknown, and have altogether\r\nperished. The very interesting discovery in the Brussels Library, of a\r\nprose _Percevale_ not impossibly older than Chrestien, and quite\r\ndifferent from that of Borron, is an indication of this fact. So also is\r\nthe discovery by Dr. Jonckbloet in the Flemish _Lancelot_, which he has\r\nedited, of passages not to be found in the existing and recognised\r\nFrench originals. The truth would appear to be that the fascination of\r\nthe subject, the unusual genius of those who first treated it, and the\r\ntendency of the middle ages to favour imitation, produced in a very\r\nshort space of time (the last quarter or half of the twelfth century) an\r\nimmense amount of original handling of Geoffrey's theme. To this\r\noriginal period succeeded one of greater length, in which the legends\r\nwere developed not merely by French followers and imitators of\r\nChrestien, but by his great German adapters, Wolfram von Eschenbach,\r\nGottfried of Strasburg, Hartmann von der Aue, and by other imitators at\r\nhome and abroad. Lastly, as we shall see in a future chapter, come\r\nRomans d'Aventures, connecting themselves by links more or less\r\nimmediate with the Round Table cycle, but independent and often quite\r\nseparate in their main incidents and catastrophes.\r\n\r\nThe great number, length, and diversity of the Arthurian romances make\r\nit impossible in the space at our command to abstract all of them, and\r\nuseless to select any one, inasmuch as no single poem is (as in the case\r\nof the Chansons) typical of the group. The style, however, of the prose\r\nand verse divisions may be seen in the following extracts from the\r\n_Chevalier a la Charrette_ of Map, and the verse of Chrestien:--\r\n\r\n     Atant sont venu li chevalier jusqu'au pont: lors commencent\r\n     a plorer top durement tuit ensamble. Et Lanceloz lor demande\r\n     porquoi il plorent et font tel duel? Et il dient que c'est\r\n     por l'amor de lui, que trop est perillox li ponz. Atant\r\n     esgarde Lanceloz l'eve de ca et de la: si voit que ele est\r\n     noire et coranz. Si avint que sa veue torna devers la cite,\r\n     si vit la tor ou la raine estoit as fenestres. Lanceloz\r\n     demande quel vile c'est la?--'Sire, font-il, c'est le leus\r\n     ou la raine est.' Si li noment la cite. Et il lor dit: 'Or\r\n     n'aiez garde de moi, que ge dont mains le pont que ge onques\r\n     mes ne fis, ne il n'est pas si perilleux d'assez comme ge\r\n     cuidoie. Mes moult a de la outre bele tor, et s'il m'i\r\n     voloient hebergier il m'i auroient encor ennuit a hoste.'\r\n     Lors descent et les conforte toz moult durement, et lor dit\r\n     que il soient ausinc tout asseur comme il est. Il li lacent\r\n     les pans de son hauberc ensenble et li cousent a gros fil de\r\n     fer qu'il avoient aporte, et ses manches meesmes li cousent\r\n     dedenz ses mains, et les piez desoz; et a bone poiz chaude\r\n     li ont peez les manicles et tant d'espes comme il ot entre\r\n     les cuisses. Et ce fu por miauz tenir contre le trenchant de\r\n     l'espee.\r\n\r\n     Quant il orent Lancelot atorne et bien et bel si lor prie\r\n     que il s'en aillent. Et il s'en vont, et le font naigier\r\n     outre l'eve, et il enmainent son cheval. Et il vient a la\r\n     planche droit: puis esgarde vers la tor ou la raine estoit\r\n     en prison, si li encline. Apres fet le signe de la verroie\r\n     croiz enmi son vis, et met son escu derriers son dos, qu'il\r\n     ne li nuise. Lors se met desor la planche en chevauchons, si\r\n     se traine par desus si armez comme il estoit, car il ne li\r\n     faut ne hauberc ne espee ne chauces ne heaume ne escu. Et\r\n     cil de la tor qui le veoient en sont tuit esbahi, ne il n'i\r\n     a nul ne nule qui saiche veroiement qui il est; mes qu'il\r\n     voient qu'il traine pardesus l'espee trenchant a la force\r\n     des braz et a l'enpaignement des genouz; si ne remaint pas\r\n     por les filz de fer que des piez et des mains et des genous\r\n     ne saille li sanz. Mes por cel peril de l'espee qui trenche\r\n     et por l'eve noire et bruiant et parfonde ne remaint que\r\n     plus ne resgart vers la tor que vers l'eve, ne plaie ne\r\n     angoisse qu'il ait ne prise naient; car se il a cele tor\r\n     pooit venir il garroit tot maintenant de ses max.

Chanson d'Alixandre.]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time as the flourishing of the Arthurian cycle there\r\nbegan to be written the third great division of Jean Bodel, 'la matiere\r\nde Rome la grant[55].' The most important beyond all question of the\r\npoems which go to make up this cycle (as it is sometimes called, though\r\nin reality its members are quite independent one of the other) is the\r\nRomance of _Alixandre_. Of the earliest French poem on this subject only\r\na few fragments exist. This is supposed to have been a work of the\r\neleventh or very early twelfth century, composed in octosyllabic verses,\r\nand in the mixed dialect common at the time in the south-east, by\r\nAlberic or Auberi of Besancon or Briancon. The _Chanson d'Alixandre_ is,\r\nhowever, in all probability a much more important work than Alberic's.\r\nIt is in form a regular Chanson de Geste, written in twelve-syllabled\r\nverse, of such strength and grace that the term Alexandrine has cleaved\r\never since to the metre. Its length, as we have it[56], is 22,606\r\nverses, and it is assigned to two authors, Lambert the Short[57] and\r\nAlexander of Bernay, though doubt has been expressed whether any of the\r\npresent poem is due to Lambert; if we have any of his work, it is not\r\nlater than the ninth decade of the twelfth century. Lambert, Alexander,\r\nand perhaps others, are thought to have known not Alberic, but a later\r\nten-syllabled version into Northern French by Simon of Poitiers. The\r\nremoter sources are various. Foremost among them may undoubtedly be\r\nplaced the Pseudo-Callisthenes, an unknown Alexandrian writer translated\r\ninto Latin about the fourth century by Julius Valerius, who fathered\r\nupon the philosopher a collection of stories partly gathered from\r\nPlutarch, Quintus Curtius, and a hundred other authorities, partly\r\nelaborated according to the fashion of Greek romancers. Some oriental\r\ntraditions of Alexander were also in the possession of western Europe.\r\nOut of all these, and with a considerable admixture of the floating\r\nfables of the time, Lambert and Alexander wove their work. There is, of\r\ncourse, not the slightest attempt at antiquity of colour. Alexander has\r\ntwelve peers, he learns the favourite studies of the middle ages, he is\r\ndubbed knight, and so forth. Many interesting legends, such as that of\r\nthe Fountain of Perpetual Youth, make their first appearance in the\r\npoem, and it is altogether one of extraordinary merit. A specimen\r\n_laisse_ may be given:--\r\n\r\n    En icele forest, dont vos m'oez conter,\r\n    nesune male choze ne puet laianz entrer.\r\n    li home ne les bestes n'i ozent converser,\r\n    onques en nesun tans ne vit hon yverner\r\n    ne trop froit ne trop chaut ne neger ne geler.\r\n    ce conte l'escripture que hom n'i doit entrer,\r\n    se il nen at talent de conquerre ou d'amer.\r\n    les deuesses d'amors i doivent habiter,\r\n    car c'est lor paradix ou el doivent entrer,\r\n    li rois de Macedoine en a oi parler,\r\n    qui cercha les merveilles dou mont et de la mer,\r\n    et ce fist il meismes enz ou fons avaler\r\n    en un vessel de voirre, ce ne puet n'on fausser,\r\n    qu'il fist faire il meismes fort et reont et cler\r\n    et enclorre de fer qu'il ne peust quasser,\r\n    s'il l'esteust a roche ou aillors ahurter,\r\n    et si que il poet bien par mi outre esgarder,\r\n    por veoir les poissons tornoier et joster\r\n    et faire lor agaiz et sovent cembeler.\r\n    et quant il vint a terre, nou mist a oublier:\r\n    la prist la sapience dou mont a conquester\r\n    et faire ses agaiz et sa gent ordener\r\n    et conduire les oz et sagement mener,\r\n    car ce fust toz li mieudres qui ainz peust monter\r\n    en cheval por conquerre ne de lance joster,\r\n    li gentiz et li larges et ii prex por doner.\r\n    la forest des puceles ot oi deviser,\r\n    cil qui tot volt conquerre i ot talent d'aler:\r\n    souz ciel n'a home en terre qui l'en peust torner.\r\n\r\nWhile the figure of Alexander served as centre to one group of fictions,\r\nmost of which were composed in Chanson form, the octosyllabic metre,\r\nwhich had made the Arthurian romances its own, was used for the\r\nversification of another numerous class, most of which dealt with the\r\ntale of Troy divine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roman de Troie.]\r\n\r\nHere also the poems were neither entirely fictitious, nor on the other\r\nhand based upon the best authorities. Dares Phrygius and Dictys\r\nCretensis, with some epitomes of Homer, were the chief sources of\r\ninformation. The principal poem of this class is the _Roman de Troie_ of\r\nBenoist de Sainte More (_c._ 1160). This work[58], which extends to more\r\nthan thirty thousand verses, has the redundancy and the long-windedness\r\nwhich characterise many, if not most, early French poems written in its\r\nmetre. But it has one merit which ought to conciliate English readers to\r\nBenoist. It contains the undoubted original of Shakespeare's Cressida.\r\nThe fortunes of Cressid (or Briseida, as the French trouvere names her)\r\nhave been carefully traced out by MM. Moland, Hericault[59], and Joly,\r\nand form a very curious chapter of literary history. Nor is this episode\r\nthe only one of merit in Benoist. His verse is always fluent and facile,\r\nand not seldom picturesque, as the following extract (Andromache's\r\nremonstrance with Hector) will show:--\r\n\r\n    Quant elle voit qe neant iert,\r\n    o ses dous poinz granz cous se fiert,\r\n    fier duel demaine e fier martire,\r\n    ses cheveus trait e ront e tire.\r\n    bien resemble feme desvee:\r\n    tote enragiee, eschevelee,\r\n    e trestote fors de son sen\r\n    court pour son fil Asternaten.\r\n    des eux plore molt tendrement,\r\n    entre ses braz l'encharge e prent.\r\n    vint el pales atot arieres,\r\n    o il chaucoit ses genoillieres.\r\n    as piez li met e si li dit\r\n    'sire, por cest enfant petit\r\n    qe tu engendras de ta char\r\n    te pri nel tiegnes a eschar\r\n    ce qe je t'ai dit e nuncie.\r\n    aies de cest enfant pitie:\r\n    james des euz ne te verra.\r\n    s'ui assembles a ceux de la,\r\n    hui est ta mort, hui est ta fins.\r\n    de toi remandra orfenins.\r\n    cruelz de cuer, lous enragiez,\r\n    par qoi ne vos en prent pitiez?\r\n    par qoi volez si tost morir?\r\n    par qoi volez si tost guerpir\r\n    et moi e li e vostre pere\r\n    e voz serors e vostre mere?\r\n    par qoi nos laisseroiz perir?\r\n    coment porrons sens vos gerir?\r\n    lasse, com male destinee!'\r\n    a icest not chai pasmee\r\n    a cas desus le paviment.\r\n    celle l'en lieve isnelement\r\n    qi estrange duel en demeine:\r\n    c'est sa seroge, dame Heleine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Romances on Classical subjects.]\r\n\r\nThe poems of the Cycle of Antiquity have hitherto been less diligently\r\nstudied and reprinted than those of the other two. Few of them, with the\r\nexception of _Alixandre_ and _Troie_, are to be read even in fragments,\r\nsave in manuscript. _Le Roman d'Eneas_, which is attributed to Benoist,\r\nis much shorter than the _Roman de Troie_, and, with some omissions,\r\nfollows Virgil pretty closely. Like many other French poems, it was\r\nadapted in German by a Minnesinger, Heinrich von Veldeke. _Le Roman de\r\nThebes_, of which there is some chance of an edition, stands to Statius\r\nin the same relation as _Eneas_ to Virgil. And _Le Roman de Jules\r\nCesar_ paraphrases, though not directly, Lucan. To these must be added\r\n_Athis et Prophilias_ (Porphyrias), or the Siege of Athens, a work which\r\nhas been assigned to many authors, and the origin of which is not clear,\r\nthough it enjoyed great popularity in the middle ages. The _Protesilaus_\r\nof Hugues de Rotelande is the only other poem of this series worth the\r\nmentioning.\r\n\r\nNeither of these two classes of poems possesses the value of the\r\nChansons as documents for social history. The picture of manners in them\r\nis much more artificial. But the Arthurian romances disclose partially\r\nand at intervals a state of society decidedly more advanced than that of\r\nthe Chansons. The _bourgeois_, the country gentleman who is not of full\r\nbaronial rank, and other novel personages appear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Note to Third Edition._--Since the second edition was published M.\r\nGaston Paris has sketched in _Romania_ and summarised in his _Manuel_,\r\nbut has not developed in book form, a view of the Arthurian romances\r\ndifferent from his father's and from that given in the text. In this\r\nview the importance of 'Celtic' originals is much increased, and that of\r\nGeoffrey diminished, Walter Map disappears almost entirely to make room\r\nfor divers unknown French trouveres, the order of composition is\r\naltered, and on the whole a lower estimate is formed of the literary\r\nvalue of the cycle. The 'Celtic' view has also been maintained in a book\r\nof much learning and value, _Studies on the Legend of the Holy Grail_\r\n(London, 1888), by Mr. Alfred Nutt. I have not attempted to incorporate\r\nor to combat these views in the text for two reasons, partly because\r\nthey will most probably be superseded by others, and partly because the\r\nevidence does not seem to me sufficient to establish any of them\r\ncertainly. But having given some years to comparative literary criticism\r\nin different languages and periods, I think I may be entitled to give a\r\nsomewhat decided opinion against the 'Celtic' theory, and in favour of\r\nthat which assigns the special characteristics of the Arthurian cycle\r\nand all but a very small part of its structure of incident to the\r\nliterary imagination of the trouveres, French and English, of the\r\ntwelfth century. And I may add that as a whole it seems to me quite the\r\ngreatest literary creation of the Middle Ages, except the _Divina\r\nCommedia_, though of course it has the necessary inferiority of a\r\ncollection by a great number of different hands to a work of individual\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[51] Nennius, a Breton monk of the ninth century, has left a brief Latin\r\nChronicle in which is the earliest authentic account of the Legend of\r\nArthur. Geoffrey of Monmouth, _circa_ 1140, produced a _Historia\r\nBritonum_, avowedly based on a book brought from Britanny by Walter,\r\nArchdeacon of Oxford. No trace of this book, unless it be Nennius, can\r\nbe found. _See note at end of chapter._\r\n\r\n[52] Department of Seine-et-Marne, near Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\n[53] Map as a person belongs rather to English than to French history.\r\nHe lived in the last three quarters of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\n[54] These various Romances are not by any means equally open to study\r\nin satisfactory critical editions. To take them chronologically, M.\r\nHucher has published Robert de Borron's _Little Saint Graal_ in prose,\r\nhis _Percevale_, and the _Great Saint Graal_, with full and valuable if\r\nnot incontestable notes, 3 vols.; Le Mans, 1875-1878. The verse form of\r\nthe _Little Saint Graal_ was published by M. F. Michel in 1841. An\r\nedition of _Artus_ was promised by M. Paulin Paris, but interrupted or\r\nprevented by his death. The great works of Map, _Lancelot_ and the\r\n_Quest_, as well as the _Mort Artus_, have never been critically edited\r\nin full; and the sixteenth-century editions being rare and exceedingly\r\ncostly, as well as uncritical, they are not easily accessible, except in\r\nM. Paris' Abstract and Commentary, _Les Romans de la Table Ronde_, 5\r\nvols., 1869-1877. _Tristan_ was published partially forty years ago by\r\nM. F. Michel. _Merlin_ was edited in 1886 by M. G. Paris and M. Ulrich.\r\nA complete edition of Chrestien de Troyes has been undertaken by Dr.\r\nWendelin Foerster and has preceded to its second volume (_Yvain_). This\r\nunder its second title of _Le Chevalier au Lyon_ has also been edited by\r\nDr. Holland (third edition 1886). Besides this there is the great\r\nRomance of _Percevale_ (continued by others, especially a certain\r\nManessier), of which M. Potvin has given an excellent edition, 6 vols.,\r\nMons, 1867-1872, including in it a previously unknown prose version of\r\nthe Romance of very early date; _Le Chevalier a la Charrette_, continued\r\nby Godefroy de Lagny, and edited, with the original prose from _Lancelot\r\ndu Lac_, by Dr. Jonckbloet (The Hague, 1850); and _Erec et Enide_, by M.\r\nHaupt (Berlin, 1860). This piecemeal condition of the texts, and the\r\npractical inaccessibility of many of them, make independent judgment in\r\nthe matter very difficult. What is wanted first of all is a book on the\r\nplan of M. Leon Gautier's _Epopees Francaises_, giving a complete\r\naccount of all the existing texts--for the entire editing of these\r\nlatter must necessarily take a very long time. The statements made above\r\nrepresent the opinions which appear most probable to the writer, not\r\nmerely from the comparison of authorities on the subject, but from the\r\nactual study of the texts as far as they are open to him. (_See note at\r\nend of Chapter._)\r\n\r\n[55] This expression occurs in the _Chanson des Saisnes_, i. 6. 7: 'Ne\r\nsont que iij matieres a nul home atandant, De France et de Bretaigne et\r\nde Rome la grant.'\r\n\r\n[56] Ed.

THE _ROMAN DU RENART_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign Elements in Early French Literature.]\r\n\r\nSingular as the statement may appear, no one of the branches of\r\nliterature hitherto discussed represents what may be called a specially\r\nFrench spirit. Despite the astonishing popularity and extent of the\r\nChansons de Gestes, they are, as is admitted by the most patriotic\r\nFrench students, Teutonic in origin probably, and certainly in genius.\r\nThe Arthurian legends have at least a tinge both of Celtic and Oriental\r\ncharacter; while the greater number of them were probably written by\r\nEnglishmen, and their distinguishing spirit is pretty clearly\r\nAnglo-Norman rather than French. On the other hand, Provencal poetry\r\nrepresents a temperament and a disposition which find their full\r\ndevelopment rather in Spanish and Italian literature and character than\r\nin the literature and character of France. All these divisions,\r\nmoreover, have this of artificial about them, that they are obviously\r\nclass literature--the literature of courtly and knightly society, not\r\nthat of the nation at large. Provencal literature gives but scanty\r\nsocial information; from the earlier Chansons at least it would be hard\r\nto tell that there were any classes but those of nobles, priests, and\r\nfighting men; and though, as has been said, a more complicated state of\r\nsociety appears in the Arthurian legends, what may be called their\r\natmosphere is even more artificial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Esprit Gaulois makes its appearance.]\r\n\r\nIt is far otherwise with the division of literature which we are now\r\nabout to handle. The Fabliaux[60], or short verse tales of old France,\r\ntake in the whole of its society from king to peasant with all the\r\nintervening classes, and represent for the most part the view taken of\r\nthose classes by each other. Perhaps the _bourgeois_ standpoint is most\r\nprominent in them, but it is by no means the only one. Their tone too is\r\nof the kind which has ever since been specially associated with the\r\nFrench genius. What is called by French authors the _esprit gaulois_--a\r\nspirit of mischievous and free-spoken jocularity--does not make its\r\nappearance at once, or in all kinds of work. In most of the early\r\ndepartments of French literature there is a remarkable deficiency of the\r\ncomic element, or rather that element is very much kept under. The\r\ncomedy of the Chansons consists almost entirely in the roughest\r\nhorse-play; while the knightly notion of _gabz_ or jests is exemplified\r\nin the _Voyage de Charlemagne a Constantinople_, where it seems to be\r\nlimited to extravagant, and not always decent, boasts and gasconnades.\r\nMore comic, but still farcical in its comedy, is the curious running\r\nfire of exaggerated expressions of poltroonery which the Red Lion keeps\r\nup in _Antioche_, while the names and virtues of the Christian leaders\r\nare being catalogued to Corbaran. In the Arthurian Romances also the\r\ncomic element is scantily represented, and still takes the same form of\r\nexaggeration and horse-play. At the same time it is proper to say that\r\nboth these classes of compositions are distinguished, at least in their\r\nearlier examples, by a very strict and remarkable decency of language.\r\n\r\nIn the Fabliaux the state of things is quite different. The attitude is\r\nalways a mocking one, not often going the length of serious satire or\r\nmoral indignation, but contenting itself with the peculiar ludicrous\r\npresentation of life and humanity of which the French have ever since\r\nbeen the masters. In the Fabliaux begins that long course of scoffing at\r\nthe weaknesses of the feminine sex which has never been interrupted\r\nsince. In the Fabliaux is to be found for the first time satirical\r\ndelineation of the frailties of churchmen instead of adoring celebration\r\nof the mysteries of the Church. All classes come in by turns for\r\nridicule--knights, burghers, peasants. Unfortunately this freedom in\r\nchoice of subject is accompanied by a still greater freedom in the\r\nchoice of language. The coarseness of expression in many of the Fabliaux\r\nequals, if it does not exceed, that to be found in any other branch of\r\nWestern literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definition of Fabliaux.]\r\n\r\nThe interest of the Fabliaux as a literary study is increased by the\r\nprecision with which they can be defined, and the well-marked period of\r\ntheir composition. According to the excellent definition of its latest\r\neditor, the Fabliau[61] is 'le recit, le plus souvent comique, d'une\r\naventure reelle ou possible, qui se passe dans les donnees moyennes de\r\nla vie humaine,' the recital, for the most part comic, of a real or\r\npossible event occurring in the ordinary conditions of human life. M. de\r\nMontaiglon, to be rigidly accurate, should have added that it must be in\r\nverse, and, with very rare, if any, exceptions, in octosyllabic\r\ncouplets. Of such Fabliaux, properly so called, we possess perhaps two\r\nhundred. They are of the most various length, sometimes not extending to\r\nmore than a score or so of lines, sometimes containing several hundreds.\r\nThey are, like most contemporary literature, chiefly anonymous, or\r\nattributed to persons of whom nothing is known, though some famous\r\nnames, especially that of the Trouvere Ruteboeuf, appear among their\r\nauthors. Their period of composition seems to have extended from the\r\nlatter half of the twelfth century to the latter half of the fourteenth,\r\nno manuscript that we have of them being earlier than the beginning of\r\nthe thirteenth century, and none later than the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth. If, however, their popularity in their original form ceased\r\nat the latter period, their course was by no means run. They had passed\r\nearly from France into Italy (as indeed all the oldest French literature\r\ndid), and the stock-in-trade of all the Italian _Novellieri_ from\r\nBoccaccio downwards was supplied by them. In England they found an\r\nillustrious copyist in Chaucer, whose Canterbury Tales are perfect\r\nFabliaux, informed by greater art and more poetical spirit than were\r\npossessed by their original authors. In France itself the Fabliaux\r\nsimply became farces or prose tales, as the wandering reciter of verse\r\ngave way to the actor and the bookseller. They appear again (sometimes\r\nafter a roundabout journey through Italian versions) in the pages of the\r\nFrench tale-tellers of the Renaissance, and finally, as far as collected\r\nappearance is concerned, receive their last but not their least\r\nbrilliant transformation in the _Contes_ of La Fontaine. In these the\r\ncycle is curiously concluded by a return to the form of the original.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subjects and character of Fabliaux.]\r\n\r\nUntil MM. de Montaiglon and Raynaud undertook their edition, which has\r\nbeen slowly completed, the study of the Fabliaux was complicated by the\r\nsomewhat chaotic conditions of the earlier collections. Barbazan and his\r\nfollowers printed as Fabliaux almost everything that they found in verse\r\nwhich was tolerably short. Thus, not merely the mediaeval poems called\r\n_dits_ and _debats_, descriptions of objects either in monologue or\r\ndialogue, which come sometimes very close to the Fabliau proper, but\r\nmoral discourses, short romances, legends like the _Lai d'Aristote_, and\r\nsuch-like things, were included. This interferes with a comprehension of\r\nthe remarkably characteristic and clearly marked peculiarities of the\r\nFabliau indicated in the definition given above. As according to this\r\nthe Fabliau is a short comic verse tale of ordinary life, it will be\r\nevident that the attempts which have been made to classify Fabliaux\r\naccording to their subjects were not very happy. It is of course\r\npossible to take such headings as Priests, Women, Villeins, Knights,\r\netc., and arrange the existing Fabliaux under them. But it is not\r\nobvious what is gained thereby. A better notion of the _genre_ may\r\nperhaps be obtained from a short view of the subjects of some of the\r\nprincipal of those Fabliaux whose subjects are capable of description.\r\n_Les deux Bordeors Ribaux_ is a dispute between two Jongleurs who boast\r\ntheir skill. It is remarkable for a very curious list of Chansons de\r\nGestes which the clumsy reciter quotes all wrong, and for a great\r\nnumber of the sly hits at chivalry and the chivalrous romances which are\r\ncharacteristic of all this literature. Thus one Jongleur, going through\r\nthe list of his knightly patrons, tells of Monseignor Augier Poupee--\r\n\r\n    'Qui a un seul coup de s'espee\r\n    Coupe bien a un chat l'oreille;'\r\n\r\nand of Monseignor Rogier Ertaut, whose soundness in wind and limb is not\r\ndue to enchanted armour or skill in fight, but is accounted for thus--\r\n\r\n    'Quar onques ne ot cop feru' (for that never has he struck a blow).\r\n\r\n_Le Vair Palefroi_ contains the story of a lover who carries off his\r\nbeloved on a palfrey grey from an aged wooer. _La Housse Partie_, a\r\ngreat favourite, which appears in more than one form, tells the tale of\r\nan unnatural son who turns his father out of doors, but is brought to a\r\nbetter mind by his own child, who innocently gives him warning that he\r\nin turn will copy his example. _Sire Hain et Dame Anieuse_ is one of the\r\ninnumerable stories of rough correction of scolding wives. _Brunain la\r\nVache au Prestre_ recounts a trick played on a covetous priest. In _Le\r\nDit des Perdrix_, a greedy wife eats a brace of partridges which her\r\nhusband has destined for his own dinner, and escapes his wrath by one of\r\nthe endless stratagems which these tales delight in assigning to\r\nwomankind. _Le sot Chevalier_, though extremely indecorous, deserves\r\nnotice for the Chaucerian breadth of its farce, at which it is\r\nimpossible to help laughing. _The two Englishmen and the Lamb_ is\r\nperhaps the earliest example of English-French, and turns upon the\r\nmistake which results in an ass's foal being bought instead of the\r\nrequired animal. _Le Mantel Mautaillie_ is the famous Arthurian story\r\nknown in English as 'The Boy and the Mantle.' _Le Vilain Mire_ is the\r\noriginal of Moliere's _Medecin malgre lui_. _Le Vilain qui conquist\r\nParadis par Plaist_ is characteristic of the curious irreverence which\r\naccompanied mediaeval devotion. A villein comes to heaven's gate, is\r\nrefused admission, and successively silences St. Peter, St. Thomas, and\r\nSt. Paul, by very pointed references to their earthly weaknesses. As a\r\nlast specimen may be mentioned the curiously simple word-play of\r\n_Estula_. This is the name of a little dog which, being pronounced,\r\ncertain thieves take for 'Es tu la?'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sources of Fabliaux.]\r\n\r\nSuch are a very few, selected as well as may be for their typical\r\ncharacter, of these stories. It is not unimportant to consider briefly\r\nthe question of their origin. Many of them belong no doubt to that\r\nstrange common fund of fiction which all nations of the earth\r\nindiscriminately possess. A considerable number seem to be of purely\r\noriginal and indigenous growth: but an actual literary source is not\r\nwanting in many cases. The classics supplied some part of them, the\r\nScriptures and the lives of the saints another part; while not a little\r\nwas due to the importation of Eastern collections of stories resulting\r\nfrom the Crusades. The chief of these collections were the fables of\r\nBidpai or Pilpai, in the form known as the romance of 'Calila and\r\nDimna,' and the story of Sendabar (in its Greek form Syntipas). This was\r\nimmensely popular in France under the verse form of _Dolopathos_, and\r\nthe prose form of _Les sept Sages de Rome_. The remarkable collection of\r\nstories called the _Gesta Romanorum_ is apparently of later date than\r\nmost of the Fabliaux; but the tales of which it was composed no doubt\r\nfloated for some time in the mouths of Jongleurs before the unknown and\r\nprobably English author put them together in Latin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman du Renart.]\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the Fabliaux is one of the most singular works of\r\nmediaeval imagination, the _Roman du Renart_[62]. This is no place to\r\nexamine the origin or antiquity of the custom of making animals the\r\nmouthpieces of moral and satirical utterance on human affairs. It is\r\nsufficient that the practice is an ancient one, and that the middle ages\r\nwere early acquainted with Aesop and his followers, as well as with\r\nOriental examples of the same sort. The original author, whoever he was,\r\nof the epic (for it is no less) of 'Reynard the Fox,' had therefore\r\nexamples of a certain sort before his eyes. But these examples contented\r\nthemselves for the most part with work of small dimension, and had not\r\nattempted connected or continuous story. A fierce battle has been fought\r\nas to the nationality of Reynard. The facts are these. The oldest form\r\nof the story now extant is in Latin. It is succeeded at no very great\r\ninterval by German, Flemish, and French versions. Of these the German as\r\nit stands is apparently the oldest, the Latin version being probably of\r\nthe second half of the twelfth century, and the German a little later.\r\nBut (and this is a capital point) the names of the more important beasts\r\nare in all the versions French. From this and some minute local\r\nindications, it seems likely that the original language of the epic is\r\nFrench, but French of the Walloon or Picard dialect, and that it was\r\nwritten somewhere in the district between the Seine and the Rhine. This,\r\nhowever, is a matter of the very smallest literary importance. What is\r\nof great literary importance is the fact that it is in France that the\r\nstory receives its principal development, and that it makes its home.\r\nThe Latin, Flemish, and German Reynards, though they all cover nearly\r\nthe same ground, do not together amount to more than five-and-twenty\r\nthousand lines. The French in its successive developments amounts to\r\nmore than ninety thousand in the texts already published or abstracted;\r\nand this does not include the variants in the Vienna manuscript of\r\n_Renart le Contrefait_, or the different developments of the _Ancien\r\nRenart_, recently published by M. Ernest Martin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ancien Renart.]\r\n\r\nThe order and history of the building up of this vast composition are as\r\nfollows. The oldest known 'branches,' as the separate portions of the\r\nstory are called, date from the beginning of the thirteenth century.\r\nThese are due to a named author, Pierre de Saint Cloud. But it is\r\nimpossible to say that they were actually the first written in French:\r\nindeed it is extremely improbable that they were so. However this may\r\nbe, during the thirteenth century a very large number of poets wrote\r\npieces independent of each other in composition, but possessing the same\r\ngeneral design, and putting the same personages into play. In what has\r\nhitherto been the standard edition of _Renart_, Meon published\r\nthirty-two such poems, amounting in the aggregate to more than thirty\r\nthousand verses. Chabaille added five more in his supplement, and M.\r\nErnest Martin has found yet another in an Italianised version. This last\r\neditor thinks that eleven branches, which he has printed together,\r\nconstitute an 'ancient collection' within the _Ancien Renart_, and have\r\na certain connection and interdependence. However this may be, the\r\ngeneral plan is extremely loose, or rather non-existent. Everybody knows\r\nthe outline of the story of Reynard; how he is among the animals (Noble\r\nthe lion, who is king, Chanticleer the cock, Firapel the leopard,\r\nGrimbart the badger, Isengrin the wolf, and the rest) the special\r\nrepresentative of cunning and valour tempered by discretion, while his\r\nenemy Isengrin is in the same way the type of stupid headlong force, and\r\nmany of the others have moral character less strongly marked but\r\ntolerably well sustained. How this general idea is illustrated the\r\ntitles of the branches show better than the most elaborate description.\r\n'How Reynard ate the carrier's fish;' 'how Reynard made Isengrin fish\r\nfor eels;' 'how Reynard cut the tail of Tybert the cat;' 'how Reynard\r\nmade Isengrin go down the well;' 'of Isengrin and the mare;' 'how\r\nReynard and Tybert sang vespers and matins;' 'the pilgrimage of\r\nReynard,' and so forth. Written by different persons, and at different\r\ntimes, these branches are of course by no means uniform in literary\r\nvalue. But the uniformity of spirit in most, if not in all of them, is\r\nextremely remarkable. What is most noticeable in this spirit is the\r\nperpetual undertone of satirical comment on human life and its affairs\r\nwhich distinguishes it. The moral is never obtrusively put forward, and\r\nit is especially noteworthy that in this _Ancien Renart_, as contrasted\r\nwith the later development of the poem, there is no mere allegorising,\r\nand no attempt to make the animals men in disguise. They are quite\r\nnatural and distinct foxes, wolves, cats, and so forth, acting after\r\ntheir kind, with the exception of their possession of reason and\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Le Couronnement Renart.]\r\n\r\nThe next stage of the composition shows an alteration and a degradation.\r\n_Renart le Couronne_, or _Le Couronnement Renart_[63], is a poem of some\r\n3400 lines, which was once attributed to Marie de France, for no other\r\nreason than that the manuscript which contains it subjoins her _Ysopet_\r\nor fables. It is, however, certainly not hers, and is in all probability\r\na little later than her time. The main subject of it is the cunning of\r\nthe fox, who first reconciles the great preaching orders Franciscans and\r\nDominicans; then himself becomes a monk, and inculcates on them the art\r\nof _Renardie_; then repairs to court as a confessor to the lion king\r\nNoble who is ill, and contrives to be appointed his successor, after\r\nwhich he holds tournaments, journeys to Palestine, and so forth. It is\r\ncharacteristic of the decline of taste that in the list of his army a\r\nwhole bestiary (or list of the real and fictitious beasts of mediaeval\r\nzoology) is thrust in; and the very introduction of the abstract term\r\n_Renardie_, or foxiness, is an evil sign of the abstracting and\r\nallegorising which was about to spoil poetry for a time, and to make\r\nmuch of the literature of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries tedious\r\nand heavy. The poem is of little value or interest. The only\r\nchronological indication as to its composition is the eulogy of William\r\nof Flanders, killed ('jadis,' says the author) in 1251.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Renart le Nouvel.]\r\n\r\nThe next poem of the cycle is of much greater length, and of at least\r\nproportionately greater value, though it has not the freshness and\r\n_verve_ of the earlier branches. _Renart le Nouvel_ was written in 1288\r\nby Jacquemart Gielee, a Fleming. This poem is in many ways interesting,\r\nthough not much can be said for its general conception, and though it\r\nsuffers terribly from the allegorising already alluded to. In its first\r\nbook (it consists of more than 8000 lines, divided into two books and\r\nmany branches) Renart, in consequence of one of his usual quarrels with\r\nIsengrin, gets into trouble with the king, and is besieged in\r\nMaupertuis. But the sense of verisimilitude is now so far lost, that\r\nMaupertuis, instead of being a fox's earth, is an actual feudal castle;\r\nand more than this, the animals which attack and defend it are armed in\r\npanoply, ride horses, and fight like knights of the period. Besides this\r\nthe old familiar and homely personages are mixed up with a very strange\r\nset of abstractions in the shape of the seven deadly sins. All this is\r\ncuriously blended with reminiscences and rehandlings of the older and\r\nsimpler adventures. Another remarkable feature about _Renart le Nouvel_\r\nis that it is full of songs, chiefly love songs, which are given with\r\nthe music. Its descriptions, though prolix, and injured by allegorical\r\nphrases, are sometimes vigorous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Renart le Contrefait.]\r\n\r\nThe cycle was finally completed in the second quarter of the fourteenth\r\ncentury by the singular work or works called _Renart le Contrefait_.\r\nThis has, unfortunately, never been printed in full, nor in any but the\r\nmost meagre extracts and abstracts. Its length is enormous; though, in\r\nthe absence of opportunity for examining it, it is not easy to tell how\r\nmuch is common to the three manuscripts which contain it. Two of these\r\nare in Paris and one in Vienna, the latter being apparently identical\r\nwith one which Menage saw and read in the seventeenth century. One of\r\nthe Parisian manuscripts contains about 32,000 verses, the other about\r\n19,000; and the Vienna version seems to consist of from 20,000 to 25,000\r\nlines of verse, and about half that number of prose. The author (who, in\r\nso far as he was a single person, appears to have been a clerk of\r\nTroyes, in Champagne) wrote it, as he says, to avoid idleness, and seems\r\nto have regarded it as a vast commonplace book, in which to insert the\r\nresult not merely of his satirical reflection, but of his miscellaneous\r\nreading. A noteworthy point about this poem is that in one place the\r\nwriter expressly disowns any concealment of his satirical intention. His\r\nbook, he says, has nothing to do with the kind of fox that kills\r\npullets, has a big brush, and wears a red skin, but with the fox that\r\nhas two hands and, what is more, two faces under one hood[64].\r\nNotwithstanding this, however, there are many passages where the old\r\n'common form' of the epic is observed, and where the old personages make\r\ntheir appearance. Indeed their former adventures are sometimes served up\r\nagain with slight alterations. Besides this there is a certain number of\r\namusing stories and _fabliaux_, the most frequently quoted of which is\r\nthe tale of an ugly but wise knight who married a silly but beautiful\r\ngirl in hopes of having children uniting the advantages of both parents,\r\nwhereas the actual offspring of the union were as ugly as the father and\r\nas silly as the mother. Combined with these things are numerous\r\nallusions to the grievances of the peasants and burghers of the time\r\nagainst the upper classes, with some striking legends illustrative\r\nthereof, such as the story of a noble dame, who, hearing that a vassal's\r\nwife had been buried in a large shroud of good stuff, had the body taken\r\nup and seized the shroud to make horsecloths of. This original matter,\r\nhowever, is drowned in a deluge not merely of moralising but of didactic\r\nverse of all kinds. The history of Alexander is told in one version by\r\nReynard to the lion king in 7000 verses, and is preluded and followed by\r\nan account of the history of the world on a scarcely smaller scale. This\r\nproceeding, at least in the Vienna version, seems to be burdensome even\r\nto Noble himself, who, at the reign of Augustus, suggests that Reynard\r\nshould exchange verse for prose, and 'compress.' The warning cannot be\r\nsaid to be unnecessary: but works as long as _Renart le Contrefait_,\r\nand, as far as it is possible to judge, not more interesting, have been\r\nprinted of late years; and it is very much to be wished that the\r\npublication of it might be undertaken by some competent scholar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fauvel.]\r\n\r\nRenart is not the only bestial personage who was made at this time a\r\nvehicle of satire. In the days of Philippe le Bel a certain Francois de\r\nRues composed a poem entitled _Fauvel_, from the name of the hero, a\r\nkind of Centaur, who represents vice of all kinds. The direct object of\r\nthe poem was to attack the pope and the clergy.\r\n\r\nSome extracts from the _Fabliau_ of the Partridges and from _Renart_ may\r\nappropriately now be given:--\r\n\r\n      Por ce que fabliaus dire sueil,\r\n    en lieu de fable dire vueil\r\n    une aventure qui est vraie,\r\n    d'un vilain qui deles sa haie\r\n    prist deus pertris par aventure.\r\n    en l'atorner mist moult sa cure;\r\n    sa fame les fist au feu metre.\r\n    ele s'en sot bien entremetre:\r\n    le feu a fait, la haste atorne.\r\n    et li vilains tantost s'en torne,\r\n    por le prestre s'en va corant.\r\n    mais au revenir targa tant\r\n    que cuites furent les pertris.\r\n    la dame a le haste jus mis,\r\n    s'en pinca une peleure,\r\n    quar molt ama la lecheure,\r\n    quant diex li dona a avoir.\r\n    ne beoit pas a grant avoir,\r\n    mais a tos ses bons acomplir.\r\n    l'une pertris cort envair:\r\n    andeus les eles en menjue.\r\n    puis est alee en mi la rue\r\n    savoir se ses sires venoit.\r\n    quant ele venir ne le voit,\r\n    tantost arriere s'en retorne,\r\n    et le remanant tel atorne\r\n    mal du morsel qui remainsist.\r\n    adonc s'apenssa et si dist\r\n    que l'autre encore mengera.\r\n    moult tres bien set qu'ele dira,\r\n    s'on li demande que devindrent:\r\n    ele dira que li chat vindrent,\r\n    quant ele les ot arrier traites;\r\n    tost li orent des mains retraites,\r\n    et chascuns la seue en porta.\r\n\r\n      *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n      Tant dura cele demoree\r\n    que la dame fu saoulee,\r\n    et li vilains ne targa mie:\r\n    a l'ostel vint, en haut s'escrie\r\n    'diva, sont cuites les pertris?'\r\n    'sire,' dist ele. 'aincois va pis,\r\n    quar mengies les a li chas.'\r\n    li vilains saut isnel le pas,\r\n    seure li cort comme enragies.\r\n    ja li eust les iex sachies,\r\n    quant el crie 'c'est gas, c'est gas.\r\n    fuiies,' fet ele, 'Sathanas!\r\n    couvertes sont por tenir chaudes.'\r\n\r\n(He accepts the excuse; bids her lay the table, and goes to sharpen his\r\nknife. The priest arrives. She tells him that her husband is plotting\r\noutrage against him, and as a proof shows him sharpening his knife. The\r\npriest flies, and she tells her husband that he has run off with the\r\npartridges. The husband pursues, but in vain, and the Fabliau thus\r\nconcludes:--)\r\n\r\n      A l'ostel li vilains retorne,\r\n    et lors sa feme en araisone:\r\n    'diva,' fait il, 'et quar me dis\r\n    coment tu perdis les pertris?'\r\n    cele li dist 'se diex m'ait,\r\n    tantost que li prestres me vit,\r\n    si me pria, se tant l'amasse,\r\n    que je les pertris li moustrasse,\r\n    quar moult volentiers les verroit\r\n    et je le menai la tout droit\r\n    ou je les avoie couvertes.\r\n    il ot tantost les mains ouvertes,\r\n    si les prist et si s'en fui.\r\n    mes je gueres ne le sivi,\r\n    ains le vous fis moult tost savoir.'\r\n    cil respont 'bien pues dire voir\r\n    or le laissons a itant estre.'\r\n    ainsi fu engingnies le prestre\r\n    et Gombaus qui les pertris prist.\r\n    par example cis fabliaus dist:\r\n    fame est faite por decevoir.\r\n    menconge fait devenir voir\r\n    et voir fait devenir menconge.\r\n    cil n'i vout metre plus d'alonge\r\n    qui fist cest fablel et ces dis.\r\n    ci faut li fabliaus des pertris.\r\n\r\n(_Reynard and Isengrin go a-fishing._)\r\n\r\n      Ce fu un poi devant Noel\r\n    que l'en metoit bacons en sel,\r\n    li ciex fu clers et estelez,\r\n    et li vivier fu si gelez,\r\n    ou Ysengrin devoit peschier,\r\n    qu'on pooit par desus treschier,\r\n    fors tant c'un pertuis i avoit,\r\n    qui des vilains faiz i estoit,\r\n    ou il menoient lor atoivre\r\n    chascune nuit juer et boivre:\r\n    un seel i estoit laissiez.\r\n    la vint Renarz toz eslaissiez\r\n    et son compere apela.\r\n    'sire,' fait il, 'traiiez vos ca:\r\n    ci est la plente des poissons\r\n    et li engins ou nos peschons\r\n    les anguiles et les barbiaus\r\n    et autres poissons bons et biaus.'\r\n    dist Ysengrins 'sire Renart,\r\n    or le prenez de l'une part,\r\n    sel me laciez bien a la qeue.'\r\n    Renarz le prent et si li neue\r\n    entor la qeue au miex qu'il puet.\r\n    'frere,' fait il, 'or vos estuet\r\n    moult sagement a maintenir\r\n    por les poissons avant venir.'\r\n    lors s'est en un buisson fichiez:\r\n    si mist son groing entre ses piez\r\n    tant que il voie que il face.\r\n    et Ysengrins est seur la glace\r\n    et li seaus en la fontaine\r\n    plains de glacons a bone estraine.\r\n    l'aive conmence a englacier\r\n    et li seaus a enlacier\r\n    qui a la qeue fu noez:\r\n    de glacons fu bien serondez.\r\n    la qeue est en l'aive gelee\r\n    et en la glace seelee.\r\n\r\nThis chapter would be incomplete without a reference to the _Ysopet_ of\r\nMarie de France[65], which may be said to be a link of juncture between\r\nthe Fabliau and the _Roman du Renart_. _Ysopet_ (diminutive of Aesop)\r\nbecame a common term in the middle ages for a collection of fables.\r\nThere is one known as the _Ysopet of Lyons_, which was published not\r\nlong ago[66]; but that of Marie is by far the most important. It\r\nconsists of 103 pieces, written in octosyllabic couplets, with\r\nmoralities, and a conclusion which informs us that the author wrote it\r\n'for the love of Count William' (supposed to be Long-Sword), translating\r\nit from an English version of a Latin translation of the Greek. Marie's\r\ngraceful style and her easy versification are very noticeable here,\r\nwhile her morals are often well deduced and sharply put. The famous\r\n'Wolf and Lamb' will serve as a specimen.\r\n\r\n      Ce dist dou leu e dou aignel,\r\n    qui beveient a un rossel:\r\n    li lox a lo sorse beveit\r\n    e li aigniaus aval esteit.\r\n    irieement parla li lus\r\n    ki mult esteit cuntralius;\r\n    par mautalent palla a lui:\r\n    'tu m'as,' dist il, 'fet grant anui.'\r\n    li aignez li ad respundu\r\n    'sire, eh quei?'

Meanwhile Le Grand d'Aussy had\r\n(1774-1781) given extracts, abstracts, and translations into modern\r\nFrench of many of them. Jubinal, Robert, and others enriched the\r\ncollection further, and in vol. xxiii. of the _Histoire Litteraire_ M.\r\nV. Le Clerc published an excellent study of the subject. A complete\r\ncollection of Fabliaux has, however, only recently been attempted, by M.\r\nM. A. de Montaiglon and G. Raynaud (6 vols., Paris, 1872-1888).\r\n\r\n[61] _Fabliau_ is, of course, the Latin _fabula_. The genealogy of the\r\nword is _fabula_, _fabella_, _fabel_, _fable_, _fablel_, _fableau_,\r\n_fabliau_. All these last five forms exist.\r\n\r\n[62] It should be noticed that this title, though consecrated by usage,\r\nis a misnomer. It should be _Roman_ de _Renart_, for this latter is a\r\nproper name. The class name is _goupil_ (vulpes). The standard edition\r\nis that of Meon (4 vols., Paris, 1826) with the supplement of Chabaille,\r\n1835. This includes not merely the _Ancien Renart_, but the\r\n_Couronnement_ and _Renart le Nouvel_. _Renart le Contrefait_ has never\r\nbeen printed. Rothe (Paris, 1845) and Wolf (Vienna, 1861) have given the\r\nbest accounts of it. Recently M. Ernest Martin has given a new critical\r\nedition of the _Ancien Renart_ (3 vols., Strasburg and Paris,\r\n1882-1887).\r\n\r\n[63] The necessary expression of the genitive by _de_ is later than\r\nthis. Mediaeval French retained the inflection of nouns, though in a\r\ndilapidated condition. Properly speaking _Renars_ is the nominative,\r\n_Renart_ the general inflected case.\r\n\r\n[64] This is a free translation of the last line of the original, which\r\nis as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Pour renard qui gelines tue,\r\n    Qui a la rousse peau vestue,\r\n    Qui a grand queue et quatre pies,\r\n    N'est pas ce livre communies;\r\n    Mais pour cellui qui a deux mains\r\n    Dont il sont en ce siecle mains,\r\n    Qui ont sous la chappe Faulx Semblant.\r\n\r\n    Wolf, _Op. cit._ p. 5.\r\n\r\nThe final allusion is to a personage of the _Roman de la Rose_.\r\n\r\n[65] Ed.

Heilbronn, 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nEARLY LYRICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early and Later Lyrics.]\r\n\r\nThe lyric poetry of the middle ages in France divides itself naturally\r\ninto two periods, distinguished by very strongly marked characteristics.\r\nThe end of the thirteenth century is the dividing point in this as in\r\nmany other branches of literature. After that we get the extremely\r\ninteresting, if artificial, forms of the Rondeau and Ballade, with their\r\nmany varieties and congeners. With these we shall not busy ourselves in\r\nthe present chapter. But the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are\r\nprovided with a lyric growth, less perfect indeed in form than that\r\nwhich occupied French singers from Machault to Marot, but more\r\nspontaneous, fuller of individuality, variety, and vigour, and scarcely\r\nless abundant in amount.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origins of Lyric.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Romances and Pastourelles.]\r\n\r\nBefore the twelfth century we find no traces of genuine lyrical work in\r\nFrance. The ubiquitous _Cantilenae_ indeed again make their appearance\r\nin the speculations of literary historians, but here as elsewhere they\r\nhave no demonstrable historical existence. Except a few sacred songs,\r\nsometimes, as in the case of Saint Eulalie, in early Romance language,\r\nsometimes in what the French call _langue farcie_, that is to say, a\r\nmixture of French and Latin, nothing regularly lyrical is found up to\r\nthe end of the eleventh century. But soon afterwards lyric work becomes\r\nexceedingly abundant. This is what forms the contents of Herr Karl\r\nBartsch's delightful volume of _Romanzen und Pastourellen_[67]. These\r\nare the two earliest forms of French lyric poetry. They are recognised\r\nby the Troubadour Raimon Vidal as the special property of the Northern\r\ntongue, and no reasonable pretence has been put forward to show that\r\nthey are other than indigenous. The tendency of both is towards iambic\r\nrhythm, but it is not exclusively manifested as in later verse. It is\r\none of the most interesting things in French literary history to see how\r\nearly the estrangement of the language from the anapaestic and dactylic\r\nmeasures natural to Teutonic speech began to declare itself[68]. These\r\nearly poems bubble over with natural gaiety, their refrains, musical\r\nthough semi-articulate as they are, are sweet and manifold in cadence,\r\nbut the main body of the versification is either iambic or trochaic (it\r\nwas long before the latter measure became infrequent), and the freedom\r\nof the ballad-metres of England and Germany is seldom present. The\r\nRomance differs in form and still more in subject from the Pastourelle,\r\nand both differ very remarkably from the form and manner of Provencal\r\npoetry. It has been observed by nearly all students, that the love-poems\r\nof the latter language are almost always at once personal and abstract\r\nin subject. The Romance and the Pastourelle, on the contrary, are almost\r\nalways dramatic. They tell a story, and often (though not always in the\r\ncase of the Pastourelle) they tell it of some one other than the singer.\r\nThe most common form of the Romance is that of a poem varying from\r\ntwenty lines long to ten times that length and divided into stanzas.\r\nThese stanzas consist of a certain number (not usually less than three\r\nor more than eight) of lines of equal length capped with a refrain in a\r\ndifferent metre. By far the best, though by no means the earliest, of\r\nthem are those of Audefroy le Bastard, who, according to the late M.\r\nPaulin Paris, may be fixed at the beginning of the thirteenth century.\r\nAudefroy's poems are very much alike in plan, telling for the most part\r\nhow the course of some impeded true love at last ran smooth. They rank\r\nwith the very best mediaeval poetry in colour, in lively painting of\r\nmanners and feelings, and in grace of versification. Unfortunately they\r\nare one and all rather too long for quotation here. The anonymous\r\nRomance of 'Bele Erembors' will represent the class well enough. The\r\nrhyme still bears traces of assonance, which is thought to have\r\nprevailed till Audefroy's time:--\r\n\r\n    Quant vient en mai, que l'on dit as lons jors,\r\n    Que Frans en France repairent de roi cort,\r\n    Reynauz repaire devant el premier front\r\n    Si s'en passa lez lo mes Arembor,\r\n    Ainz n'en designa le chief drecier a mont.\r\n            E Raynaut amis!\r\n\r\n    Bele Erembors a la fenestre au jor\r\n    Sor ses genolz tient paile de color;\r\n    Voit Frans de France qui repairent de cort,\r\n    E voit Raynaut devant el premier front:\r\n    En haut parole, si a dit sa raison.\r\n            E Raynaut amis!\r\n\r\n    'Amis Raynaut, j'ai ja veu cel jor\r\n    Se passisoiz selon mon pere tor,\r\n    Dolanz fussiez se ne parlasse a vos.'\r\n    'Ja mesfaistes, fille d'Empereor,\r\n    Autrui amastes, si obliastes nos.'\r\n            E Raynaut amis!\r\n\r\n    'Sire Raynaut, je m'en escondirai:\r\n    A cent puceles sor sainz vos jurerai,\r\n    A trente dames que avuec moi menrai,\r\n    C'onques nul hom fors vostre cors n'amai.\r\n    Prennez l'emmende et je vos baiserai.'\r\n            E Raynaut amis!\r\n\r\n    Li cuens Raynauz en monta lo degre,\r\n    Gros par espaules, greles par lo baudre;\r\n    Blonde ot lo poil, menu, recercele:\r\n    En nule terre n'ot so biau bacheler.\r\n    Voit l'Erembors, so comence a plorer.\r\n            E Raynaut amis!\r\n\r\n    Li cuens Raynauz est montez en la tor,\r\n    Si s'est assis en un lit point a flors,\r\n    Dejoste lui se siet bele Erembors.\r\n\r\n      *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n    Lors recomencent lor premieres amors.\r\n            E Raynaut amis!\r\n\r\nThe Pastourelle is still more uniform in subject. It invariably\r\nrepresents the knight or the poet riding past and seeing a fair\r\nshepherdess by his road-side. He alights and woos her with or without\r\nsuccess. In this class of poem the stanzas are usually longer, and\r\nconsist of shorter lines than is the case with the Romances, while the\r\nrefrains are more usually meaningless though generally very musical. It\r\nis, however, well to add that the very great diversity of metrical\r\narrangement in this class makes it impossible to give a general\r\ndescription of it. There are Pastourelles consisting merely of\r\nfour-lined stanzas with no refrain at all. The following is a good\r\nspecimen of the class:--\r\n\r\n    De Saint Quentin a Cambrai\r\n    Chevalchoie l'autre jour;\r\n    Les un boisson esgardai,\r\n    Touse i vi de bel atour.\r\n    La colour\r\n    Ot freche com rose en mai.\r\n    De cuer gai\r\n    Chantant la trovai\r\n    Ceste chansonnete\r\n        'En non deu, j'ai bel ami,\r\n        Cointe et joli,\r\n        Tant soie je brunete.'\r\n\r\n    Vers la pastoure tornai\r\n    Quant la vi en son destour;\r\n    Hautement la saluai\r\n    Et di 'deus vos doinst bon jour\r\n    Et honour.\r\n    Celle ke ci trove ai,\r\n    Sens delai\r\n    Ses amis serai.'\r\n    Dont dist la doucete\r\n        'En non deu, j'ai bel ami,\r\n        Cointe et joli,\r\n        Tant soie je brunete.'\r\n\r\n    Deles li seoir alai\r\n    Et li priai de s'amour,\r\n    Celle dist 'Je n'amerai\r\n    Vos ne autrui par nul tour,\r\n    Sens pastour,\r\n    Robin, ke fiencie l'ai.\r\n    Joie en ai,\r\n    Si en chanterai\r\n    Ceste chansonnete:\r\n        En non deu, j'ai bel ami,\r\n        Cointe et joli,\r\n        Tant soie je brunete.'\r\n\r\nSo various, notwithstanding the simplicity and apparent monotony of\r\ntheir subjects, are these charming poems, that it is difficult to give,\r\nby mere citation of any one or even of several, an idea of their beauty.\r\nIn no part of the literature of the middle ages are its lighter\r\ncharacteristics more pleasantly shown. The childish freedom from care\r\nand afterthought, the half unconscious delight in the beauty of flowers\r\nand the song of birds, the innocent animal enjoyment of fine weather and\r\nthe open country, are nowhere so well represented. Chaucer may give\r\nEnglish readers some idea of all this, but even Chaucer is sophisticated\r\nin comparison with the numerous, and for the most part nameless, singers\r\nwho preceded him by almost two centuries in France. As a purely formal\r\nand literary characteristic, the use of the burden or refrain is perhaps\r\ntheir most noteworthy peculiarity. Herr Bartsch has collected five\r\nhundred of these refrains, all different. There is nothing like this to\r\nbe found in any other literature; and, as readers of Beranger know, the\r\nfashion was preserved in France long after it had been given up\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thirteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes in Lyric.]\r\n\r\nAfter the twelfth century the early lyrical literature of France\r\nundergoes some changes. In the first place it ceases to be anonymous,\r\nand individual singers--some of them, like Thibaut of Champagne, of very\r\ngreat merit and individuality--make their appearance. In the second\r\nplace it becomes more varied but at the same time more artificial in\r\nform, and exhibits evident marks of the communication between troubadour\r\nand trouvere, and of the imitation by the latter of the stricter forms\r\nof Provencal poetry. The Romance and the Pastourelle are still\r\ncultivated, but by their side grow up French versions, often adapted\r\nwith considerable independence, of the forms of the South[69]. Such, for\r\ninstance, is the _chanson d'amour_, a form less artfully regulated\r\nindeed than the corresponding canzon or sestine of the troubadours, but\r\nstill of some intricacy. It consists of five or six stanzas, each of\r\nwhich has two interlaced rhymes, and concludes with an _Envoi_, which,\r\nhowever, is often omitted. _Chansonnettes_ on a reduced scale are also\r\nfound. In these pieces the alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes,\r\nwhich was ultimately to become the chief distinguishing feature of\r\nFrench prosody, is observable, though it is by no means universal. To\r\nthe Provencal _tenson_ corresponds the _jeu parti_ or verse dialogue,\r\nwhich is sometimes arranged in the form of a Chanson. The _salut\r\nd'amour_ is a kind of epistle, sometimes of very great length and\r\nusually in octosyllabic verse, the decasyllable being more commonly used\r\nin the Chanson. Of this the _complainte_ is only a variety. Again, the\r\nProvencal _sirvente_ is represented by the northern _serventois_, a poem\r\nin Chanson form, but occupied instead of love with war, satire,\r\nreligion, and miscellaneous matters. It has even been doubted whether\r\nthe _serventois_ is not the forerunner of the _sirvente_ instead of the\r\nreverse being the case. Other forms are _motets_, _rotruenges_,\r\n_aubades_. Poems called _rondeaux_ and _ballades_ also make their\r\nappearance, but they are loose in construction and undecided in form.\r\nThe thirteenth century is, moreover, the palmy time of the Pastourelle.\r\nMost of those which we possess belong to this period, and exhibit to the\r\nfull the already indicated characteristics of that graceful form. But\r\nthe lyric forms of the thirteenth century are to some extent rather\r\nimitated than indigenous, and it is no doubt to the fact of this\r\nimitation that the common ascription of general poetical priority to the\r\nLangue d'Oc, unfounded as it has been sufficiently shown to be, is due\r\nin the main. The most courageous defenders of the North have wished to\r\nmaintain its claims wholly intact even in this instance, but\r\nprobability, if not evidence, is against them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Traces of Lyric in the Thirteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quesnes de Bethune.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thibaut de Champagne.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the number of song writers from the end of the\r\ntwelfth century to the end of the thirteenth is extremely large. M.\r\nPaulin Paris, whose elaborate chapter in the _Histoire Litteraire_ is\r\nstill the great authority on the subject, has enumerated nearly two\r\nhundred, to whose work have to be added hundreds of anonymous pieces. It\r\nwould seem indeed that during a considerable period the practice of song\r\nwriting was almost as incumbent on the French gentleman of the\r\nthirteenth century as that of sonnetteering on the English gentleman of\r\nthe sixteenth. There are, however, not a few names which deserve\r\nseparate notice. The first of these in point of time, and not the last\r\nin point of literary importance, is that of Quesnes de Bethune, the\r\nancestor of Sully, and himself a famous warrior, statesman, and poet.\r\nHis epitaph by a poet not usually remarkable for eloquence[70] is a very\r\nstriking one. It gives us approximately the date of his death, 1224; and\r\nthe word _vieux_ is supposed to show that Quesnes must have been born at\r\nleast as early as the middle of the twelfth century. He took part in two\r\ncrusades, that of Philip Augustus and that which Villehardouin has\r\nchronicled. His poems[71] are of all classes, historical, satirical, and\r\namorous, some of last being addressed to Marie, Countess of Champagne;\r\nand his Chansons are, in the technical sense, some of the earliest we\r\npossess. Contemporary with Quesnes apparently was the personage who is\r\nknown under the title of Chatelain de Coucy, and whose love for the Lady\r\nof Fayel resulted in an interchange of very tender and beautiful verse;\r\nthe poem known as the lady's own is one of the very best of its kind.\r\nLong afterwards lover and lady became the hero and heroine of a romance,\r\nwhich has led some persons to throw doubt upon their historical\r\nexistence, and the Lady of Fayel has even been deprived of her poem by a\r\nwell-known kind of criticism. Of more importance is Thibaut de\r\nChampagne, King of Navarre, who is indeed the most important single\r\nfigure of early French lyrical poetry. He was born in 1201, and died in\r\n1253. His high position as a feudal prince in both north and south, the\r\nminority of St. Louis, and the intimate relations which existed between\r\nthe King's mother, Blanche of Castille, and Thibaut, made him the mark\r\nfor a good deal of satirical invective. There is a tradition that he was\r\nBlanche's lover, the only objection to which is that the Queen was\r\nthirty years his senior. Thibaut's poems have been more than once\r\nreprinted, the last edition being that of M. Tarbe[72]; this contains\r\neighty-one pieces, not a few of which, however, are probably the work of\r\nothers. The majority of them are Chansons d'Amour, of the kind just\r\ndefined. There are, however, a good many Jeux-Partis, and a certain\r\nnumber of nondescript poems on miscellaneous subjects. There is more\r\nreason for the common opinion which attributes to Thibaut the marriage\r\nof the poetical qualities of northern and southern France, than the mere\r\nfact of his having been both Count of Champagne and King of Navarre. His\r\npoems have in reality something of the freshness and the individuality\r\nof the Trouveres, mixed with a great deal of the formal grace and\r\nelegance of the Troubadours. The following may serve as an example:--\r\n\r\n      Contre le tens qui desbrise\r\n    Yvers, et revient este,\r\n    Et la mauvis se desguise,\r\n    Qui de lonc tens n'a chante\r\n    Ferai chanson. Car a gre\r\n    Me vient que j'aie en pense\r\n    Amor, qui en moi s'est mise.\r\n    Bien m'a droit son dart gete.\r\n\r\n      Douce dame, de franchise,\r\n    N'ai je point en vos trove:\r\n    S'ele ne s'i est puis mise\r\n    Que je ne vos esgarde,\r\n    Trop avez vers moi fierte.\r\n    Mais ce fait vostre biaute,\r\n    Ou il n'i a pas de devise,\r\n    Tant en i a grand plante.\r\n\r\n      En moi n'a point d'astenance\r\n    Que je puisse aillors penser,\r\n    Pors que la, ou conoissance\r\n    Ne merci ne puis trover.\r\n    Bien fui fait por li amer;\r\n    Car ne m'en puis saoler.\r\n    Et quant plus aurai cheance,\r\n    Plus la me convendra douter.\r\n\r\n      D'une riens sui en doutance,\r\n    Que je ne puis plus celer,\r\n    Qu'en li n'ait un po d'enfance.\r\n    Ce me fait deconforter,\r\n    Que s'a moi a bon penser\r\n    Ne l'ose ele desmontrer.\r\n    Si feist qu'a sa semblance\r\n    Le poisse deviner.\r\n\r\n      Des que je li fis priere\r\n    Et la pris a esgarder,\r\n    Me fist amors la lumiere\r\n    Des iels par le cuer passer.\r\n    Cil conduit me fait grever:\r\n    Dont je ne me soi garder:\r\n    Ne ne puet torner arriere\r\n    Mon cuer; miex voudrait crever.\r\n\r\n      Dame, a vos m'estuet clamer,\r\n    Et que merci vos requiere.\r\n    Diex m'i laist pitie trover!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Singers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adam de la Halle.]\r\n\r\nBesides Thibaut there are not a few other song writers of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, who rise out of the crowd named by M. Paulin Paris. Some of\r\nthese, as might be expected, are famous for their achievements in other\r\ndepartments of literature. Such are Adam de la Halle, Jean Bodel, Guyot\r\nde Provins. There are, however, two, Gace Brule and Colin Muset, who\r\nsurvive solely but worthily as song writers. Gace Brule was a knight of\r\nChampagne, Colin Muset a professed minstrel. The former chiefly composed\r\nsentimental work; the latter, with the proverbial or professional gaiety\r\nof his class, drew nearer to the satirical tone of the Fabliau writers.\r\nHis best-known and most usually quoted work describes the different\r\nwelcome which he receives from his family on his return from\r\nprofessional tours, according to the success or ill-success with which\r\nhe has met. Two other poets, Adam de la Halle and Ruteboeuf, are far\r\nmore prominent in literary history. Adam de la Halle[73] bore the\r\nsurname 'Le Bossu d'Arras,' from his native town, though the term\r\nhunchback seems to have had no literal application to him. His exact\r\ndate is not known, but it must probably have been from the fourth to the\r\nninth decade of the thirteenth century. His dramatic works, which are of\r\nsignal importance, will be noticed elsewhere. But besides these he has\r\nleft some seventy or eighty lyrical pieces of one kind or another.\r\nAdam's life was not uneventful; he was at first a monk, but left his\r\nconvent and married. Then he proved as faithless to his temporal as he\r\nhad been to his spiritual vows. He lampooned his wife, his family, his\r\ntownsmen, and, shaking the dust of Arras from his feet, retired first to\r\nDouai and then to the court of Robert of Artois, whom he accompanied to\r\nItaly. He died in that country about 1288. The style of Adam de la Halle\r\nvaries from the coarsest satire to the most graceful tenderness. Of the\r\nlatter the following song is a good specimen:--\r\n\r\n          Diex!\r\n      Comment porroie\r\n      Trouver voie\r\n      D'aler a chelui\r\n      Cui amiete je sui?\r\n      Chainturelle, va-i\r\n          En lieu de mi;\r\n      Car tu fus sieue aussi,\r\n      Si m'en conquerra miex.\r\n\r\n           Mais comment serai sans ti?\r\n                  Dieus!\r\n      Chainturelle, mar vous vi;\r\n      Au deschaindre m'ochies;\r\n    De mes grietes a vous me confortoie,\r\n          Quant je vous sentoie,\r\n                  Ai mi!\r\n       A le saveur de mon ami.\r\n       Ne pour quant d'autres en ai,\r\n       A cleus d'argent et de soie,\r\n          Pour men user.\r\n       Mais lasse! comment porroie\r\n          Sans cheli durer\r\n          Qui me tient en joie?\r\n\r\n       Canchonnete, chelui proie\r\n                Qui le m'envoya,\r\n       Puis que jou ne puis aler la.\r\n                Qu'il en viengne a moi,\r\n                Chi droit,\r\n                  A jour failli,\r\n    Pour faire tous ses boins,\r\n        Et il m'orra,\r\n    Quant il ert joins,\r\n    Canter a haute vois:\r\n    _Par chi va la mignotise,_\r\n      _Par chi ou je vois_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ruteboeuf]\r\n\r\nRuteboeuf (whose name appears to be a nickname only) has been more\r\nfortunate than most of the poets of early France in leaving a\r\nconsiderable and varied work behind him, and in having it well and\r\ncollectively edited[74]. Little or nothing, however, is known about him,\r\nexcept from allusions in his own verse. He was probably born about 1230;\r\nhe was certainly married in 1260; there is no allusion in his poems to\r\nany event later than 1285. By birth he may have been either a Burgundian\r\nor a Parisian. His work which, as has been said, is not inconsiderable\r\nin volume, falls into three well-marked divisions in point of subject.\r\nThe first consists of personal and of comic poems; the second of poems\r\nsometimes satirical, sometimes panegyrical, on public personages and\r\nevents; the third, which is apparently with reason assigned to the\r\nlatest period of his life, of devotional poems. In the first division\r\n_La Pauvrete Ruteboeuf_, _Le Mariage Ruteboeuf_, etc., are\r\ncomplaints of his woeful condition; complaints, however, in which there\r\nis nearly as much satire as appeal. Others, such as _Renart le\r\nBestourne_, _Le Dit des Cordeliers_, _Frere Denise_, _Le Dit de\r\nl'Erberie_, are poems of the Fabliau kind. In all these there are many\r\nlively strokes of satire, and not a little of the reckless gaiety,\r\nchequered here and there with deeper feeling, which has always been a\r\ncharacteristic of a certain number of French poets. Ruteboeuf's\r\nsarcasm is especially directed towards the monastic orders. The second\r\nclass of poems, which is numerous, displays a more elevated strain of\r\nthought. Many of these poems are _complaintes_ or elaborate elegies\r\n(often composed on commission) for distinguished persons, such as\r\nGeoffroy de Sargines and Guillaume de Saint Amour. Others, such as the\r\n_Complainte d'Outremer_, the _Complainte de Constantinople_, the _Dit de\r\nla Voie de Tunes_, the _Debat du Croise et du Decroise_, are comments\r\non the politics and history of the time, for the most part strongly in\r\nfavour of the crusading spirit, and reproaching the nobility of France\r\nwith their degeneracy. 'Mort sont Ogier et Charlemagne' is an\r\noften-quoted exclamation of Ruteboeuf in this sense. The third class\r\nincludes _La Mort Ruteboeuf_, otherwise _La Repentance Ruteboeuf_,\r\n_La Voie de Paradis_, various poems to the Virgin, the lives of St. Mary\r\nof Egypt and St. Elizabeth of Hungary, and the miracle play of\r\n_Theophile_. Ruteboeuf's favourite metres are either the continuous\r\noctosyllabic couplet, or else a stanza composed of an octosyllabic\r\ncouplet and a line of four syllables, the termination of the latter\r\nbeing caught up by the succeeding couplet. In this the _Mariage_ is\r\nwritten, of which a specimen may be given:--\r\n\r\n      En l'an de l'incarnacion,\r\n    VIII jors apres la nascion\r\n    Jhesu qui soufri passion,\r\n    en l'an soissante,\r\n    qu'arbres n'a foille, oisel ne chante,\r\n    fis je toute la rien dolante\r\n    que de cuer m'aime:\r\n    nis li musarz musart me claime.\r\n    or puis filer, qu'il me faut traime;\r\n    mult ai a faire.\r\n    deus ne fist cuer tant de pute aire,\r\n    tant li aie fait de contraire\r\n    ne de martire,\r\n    s'il en mon martire se mire,\r\n    qui ne doie de bon cuer dire\r\n    'je te claim cuite.'\r\n    envoier un home en Egypte,\r\n    ceste dolor est plus petite\r\n    que n'est la moie;\r\n    je n'en puis mais se je m'esmoie.\r\n    l'en dit que fous qui ne foloie\r\n    pert sa saison:\r\n    sui je mariez sanz raison?\r\n    or n'ai ne borde ne maison.\r\n    encor plus fort:\r\n    por plus doner de reconfort\r\n    a ceus qui me heent de mort,\r\n    tel fame ai prise\r\n    que nus fors moi n'aime ne prise,\r\n    et s'estoit povre et entreprise,\r\n    quant je la pris.\r\n    a ci mariage de pris,\r\n    c'or sui povres et entrepris\r\n    ausi comme ele,\r\n    et si n'est pas gente ne bele.\r\n    cinquante anz a en s'escuele,\r\n    s'est maigre et seche:\r\n    n'ai pas paor qu'ele me treche.\r\n    despuis que fu nez en la greche\r\n    deus de Marie,\r\n    ne fu mais tele espouserie.\r\n    je sui toz plains d'envoiserie:\r\n    bien pert a l'uevre.\r\n\r\nThough he has less of the 'lyrical cry' than some others, Ruteboeuf is\r\nperhaps the most vigorous poet of his time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lais. Marie de France.]\r\n\r\nThere is one division of early poetry which may also be noticed under\r\nthis head, though it is sometimes dealt with as a kind of miniature\r\nepic. This is the _lai_, a term which is used in old French poetry with\r\ntwo different significations. The Trouveres of the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries made of it a regular lyrical form. But the most\r\nfamous of its examples, those which now pass under the name of Marie de\r\nFrance, are narrative poems in octosyllabic verse and varying in length\r\nconsiderably. It is agreed that the term and the thing are of Breton\r\norigin; and the opinion which seems most probable is that the word\r\noriginally had reference rather to the style of music with which the\r\nharper accompanied his verse, than to the measure, arrangement, or\r\nsubject of the latter. As to Marie herself[75], nothing is known about\r\nher with certainty. She lived in England in the reign of Henry III, and\r\noften gives English equivalents for her French words. The _lais_ which\r\nwe possess, written by her and attributed to her, are fourteen in\r\nnumber. They bear the titles of _Gugemer_, _Equitan_, _Le Fresne_, _Le\r\nBisclaveret_, _Lanval_, _Les Deux Amants_, _Ywenec_, _Le Laustic_,\r\n_Milun_, _Le Chaitivel_, _Le Chevrefeuille_, _Eliduc_, _Graalent_ and\r\n_L'Espine_. Mr. O'Shaughnessy has paraphrased several of these in\r\nEnglish[76]; they are all narrative in character. Their distinguishing\r\nfeatures are fluent and melodious versification, pure and graceful\r\nlanguage--among the purest and most graceful, though decidedly Norman in\r\ncharacter, of the time--true poetical feeling, and a lively faculty of\r\ninvention and description. After Marie there was a tendency to\r\napproximate the _lai_ to the Provencal _descort_, and at last, as we\r\nhave said, it acquired rules and a form quite alien from those of its\r\nearlier examples. There is a general though not a universal inclination\r\nto melancholy of subject in the early lays, a few of which are\r\nanonymous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Note to Third Edition._--M. Gaston Paris has expressed some surprise at\r\nmy remarks on metre (p. 63). This from so accomplished a scholar is a\r\ncurious instance of the difficulty which Frenchmen seem to feel in\r\nappreciating quantity. To an English eye and ear which have been trained\r\nto classical prosody the trochaic rhythm of, for instance, the\r\nPastourelle quoted on p. 65, is unmistakable, and there are anapaestic\r\nmetres to be found here and there in early poems of the same kind.\r\nIndeed, all French poetry is easily scanned quantitatively, though the\r\nusual authorities protest against such scansion. Voltaire, it is said,\r\ntook Turgot's hexameters for prose, and the significance of this is the\r\nsame whether the mistake, as is probable, was mischievous or whether it\r\nwas genuine.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[67] Leipsic, 1870.\r\n\r\n[68] See note at end of chapter.\r\n\r\n[69] This miscellaneous lyric for the most part awaits collection and\r\npublication.

By\r\nthe very earliest years of the twelfth century, and probably much\r\nearlier (though we have no certain evidence of this latter fact),\r\ndocuments of all kinds began to be written in verse of various forms.\r\nAmong the earliest serious verse that was written rank, as we might\r\nexpect, verse chronicles. It was not till 1200 at soonest that long\r\ntranslations from the Latin in French prose were made, but such\r\ntranslations, and original works as well, were written in French verse\r\nlong before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Verse Chronicles.]\r\n\r\nThe rhymed Chronicles were numerous, but, with rare exceptions, they\r\ncannot be said to be of any very great literary importance. Whether they\r\nwere imitated directly from the Chansons de Gestes, or _vice versa_, is\r\na question which, as it happens, can be settled without difficulty. For\r\nthey are almost all in octosyllabic couplets, a metre certainly later\r\nthan the assonanced decasyllabics of the earliest Chansons. The latter\r\nform and the somewhat later dodecasyllable or Alexandrine are rarely\r\nused for Verse Chronicles, the most remarkable exception being the\r\nspirited _Combat des Trente_[77], which is however very late, and the\r\n_Chronique de du Guesclin_ of the same date. There are earlier examples\r\nof history in Alexandrines (some are found in the twelfth century, such\r\nas the account of Henry the Second's Scotch Wars by Jordan Fantome,\r\nChancellor of the diocese of Winchester), but they are not numerous or\r\nimportant. It is not unworthy of notice that the majority of the early\r\nVerse Chronicles are English or Anglo-Norman. The first of importance is\r\nthat of Geoffrey Gaymar, whose Chronicle of English history was written\r\nabout 1146. Gaymar was followed by a much better known writer, the\r\nJerseyman Wace[78], who not only, as has been mentioned, versified\r\nGeoffrey of Monmouth into the _Brut_[79], but produced the important\r\n_Roman de Rou_[80], giving the history of the Dukes of Normandy and of\r\nthe Conquest of England. The date of the _Brut_ is 1155, of the _Rou_\r\n1160. This latter is the better of the two, though Wace was not a great\r\npoet. It consists chiefly of octosyllabics, with a curious insertion of\r\nAlexandrines in rhymed not assonanced _laisses_. Wace was followed by\r\nBenoist de Sainte-More, who extended his Chronicle of the Dukes of\r\nNormandy to more than forty thousand verses. The 'Life of St. Thomas'\r\n(Becket), by Garnier de Pont St. Maxence, also deserves notice, as does\r\nan anonymous poem on the English wars in Ireland. But the most\r\ninteresting of this group is probably the history[81] of William\r\nMarshal, Earl of Pembroke, who died in 1219 and who during his life\r\nplayed a great part in England. It abounds in passages of historical\r\ninterest and literary value. During the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies, the practice of writing history in verse gradually died out,\r\nyet some of the most important examples date from this time. Such are\r\nthe Chronicles of Philippe Mouskes[82], a Fleming, in more than thirty\r\nthousand verses, extending from the Siege of Troy to the year 1243.\r\nMouskes is of some importance in literary history, because of the great\r\nextent to which he has drawn on the Chansons de Gestes for his\r\ninformation. In 1304 Guillaume Guiart, a native of Orleans, wrote in\r\ntwelve thousand verses a Chronicle of the thirteenth century, including\r\na few years earlier and later. There are a large number of other Verse\r\nChronicles, but few of them are of much importance historically, and\r\nfewer still of any literary interest.\r\n\r\nHistory, however, was by no means the only serious subject which took\r\nthis incongruous form in the middle ages. The amount of miscellaneous\r\nverse written during the period between the end of the eleventh and the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century is indeed enormous. Only a very small\r\nportion of it has ever been printed, and the mere summary description of\r\nthe manuscripts which contain it is as yet far from complete. If it be\r\nsaid generally that, during the greater part of these three hundred\r\nyears, the first impulse of any one who wished to write, no matter on\r\nwhat subject, was to write in verse, and that the popular notion of the\r\nwant of literary tastes in the middle ages is utterly mistaken, some\r\nidea may be formed of the vast extent of literature, poetical in form,\r\nwhich was then produced. Much no doubt of this literature is not in the\r\nleast worthy of detailed notice; much, whether worthy or not, must from\r\nmere considerations of space and proportion remain unnoticed here. What\r\nis possible, is to indicate briefly the chief forms, authors, and\r\nsubjects, which fall under the heading of this chapter, and to give a\r\nsomewhat detailed account of the great serious poem of mediaeval France,\r\nthe _Roman de la Rose_. Peculiarities of metre and so forth will be\r\nindicated where it is necessary, but it may be said generally that the\r\ngreat mass of this literature is in octosyllabic couplets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miscellaneous Satirical Verse.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed in discussing the Fabliaux that the first\r\nenquirers into old French literature were led to include a very\r\nmiscellaneous assortment of poems under that head; and it may now be\r\nadded that this miscellaneous assortment with much else constitutes the\r\n_farrago_ of the present chapter. The two great poems of the _Roman du\r\nRenart_ and the _Roman de la Rose_ stand as representatives of the more\r\nor less serious poetry of the time, and everything else may be said to\r\nbe included between them. Beginning nearest to the _Roman du Renart_ and\r\nits kindred Fabliaux, we find a vast number of half-satirical styles of\r\npoetry, many, if not most of them, known (according to what has been\r\nnoted in the preface as characteristic of mediaeval literature) by\r\ndistinctive form-names. Of these _dits_ and _debats_ have already been\r\nnoticed, but it is not easy to give a notion of the number of the\r\nexisting examples, or of the extraordinary diversity of subjects to\r\nwhich both, and especially the _dits_, extend. Perhaps some estimate may\r\nbe formed from the fact that the _dits_ of three Flemish poets alone,\r\nBaudouin de Conde, Jean de Conde, and Watriquet de Couvin, fill four\r\nstout octavo volumes[83]. The subjects of these and of the large number\r\nof _dits_ composed by other writers and anonymous are almost\r\ninnumerable. The earliest are for the most part simple enumerations of\r\nthe names of streets, of street cries, of guilds, of coins, and\r\nsuch-like things. By degrees they become more definitely didactic, and\r\nat last allegorical moralising masters them as it does almost every\r\nother kind of poetry in the fourteenth century. The _debat_, sometimes\r\ncalled _dispute_, or _bataille_, is an easily understood variety of the\r\n_dit_. Ruteboeuf's principal _debat_ has been named; another in a less\r\nserious spirit is that between _Charlot et le Barbier_. There is a\r\n_Bataille des Vins_, a _Bataille de Careme et de Charnage_, a _Debat de\r\nl'Hiver et l'Ete_, etc., etc. Another name much used for half-satirical,\r\nhalf-didactic verse was that of _Bible_, of which the most famous\r\n(probably because it was the first known) is that of Guyot de\r\nProvins,--a violent onslaught on the powers that were in Church and\r\nState by a discontented monk. An extract from it will illustrate this\r\ndivision of the subject as well as anything else:--\r\n\r\n      Des fisiciens me merveil:\r\n    de lor huevre et de lor conseil\r\n    rai ge certes mont grant merveille,\r\n    nule vie ne s'apareille\r\n    a la lor, trop par est diverse\r\n    et sor totes autres perverse.\r\n    bien les nomme li communs nons;\r\n    mais je ne cuit qu'i ne soit hons\r\n    qui ne les doie mont douter.\r\n    il ne voudroient ja trover\r\n    nul home sanz aucun mehaing.\r\n    maint oingnement font e maint baing\r\n    ou il n'a ne senz ne raison,\r\n    cil eschape d'orde prison\r\n    qui de lor mains puet eschaper.\r\n    qui bien set mentir et guiler\r\n    et faire noble contenance,\r\n    tout ont trove fors la creance\r\n    que les genz ont lor fait a bien.\r\n    tiex mil se font fisicien\r\n    qui n'en sevent voir nes que gie.\r\n    li plus maistre sont mont changie\r\n    de grant ennui, n'il n'est mestiers\r\n    dont il soit tant de mencongiers.\r\n    il ocient mont de la gent:\r\n    ja n'ont ne ami ne parent\r\n    que il volsissent trover sain;\r\n    de ce resont il trop vilain.\r\n    mont a d'ordure en ces liens.\r\n    qui en main a fisiciens,\r\n    se met par els. il m'ont eu\r\n    entre lor mains: onques ne fu,\r\n    ce cuit, nule plus orde vie.\r\n    je n'aim mie lor compaignie,\r\n    si m'ait dex, qant je sui sains:\r\n    honiz est qui chiet en lor mains.\r\n    par foi, qant je malades fui,\r\n    moi covint soffrir lor ennui.\r\n\r\n_Testaments_ of the satirical kind, chiefly noteworthy for the brilliant\r\nuse which Villon made of the tradition of composing them, _resveries_\r\nand _fatrasies_ (nonsense poems with a more or less satirical drift),\r\nparodies of the offices of the Church, of its sermons, of the miracle\r\nplays, are the chief remaining divisions of the poetry which, under a\r\nlight and scoffing envelope, conceals a serious purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Didactic verse. Philippe de Thaun.]\r\n\r\nSuch things have at all times been composed in verse, and the reason is\r\nsufficiently obvious. In the first place, the intention of the writers\r\nis to a certain extent masked, and in the second, the reader's attention\r\nis attracted. But the middle ages by no means confined the use of verse\r\nto such cases. Downright instruction was, as often as not, the object of\r\nthe verse writer in those days. The earliest, and as such the most\r\ncurious of didactic poems, are those of Philippe de Thaun, an Englishman\r\nof Norman extraction, who wrote in the first quarter of the twelfth\r\ncentury. His two works are a _Comput_, or Chronological Treatise,\r\ndedicated to an uncle of his, who was chaplain to Hugh Bigod, Earl of\r\nNorfolk, and a _Bestiary_, or Zoological Catalogue, dedicated to Adela\r\nof Louvain, the wife of Henry the First. Written before the vogue of the\r\nversified Arthurian Romances had consecrated the octosyllable, these\r\npoems are in couplets of six syllables. Their great age, and to a\r\ncertain extent their literary merit, deserve an extract:--\r\n\r\n      Monosceros est beste,\r\n    un corn ad en la teste,\r\n    pur ceo ad si a nun.\r\n    de buc ele ad facun.\r\n    par pucele eat prise,\r\n    or oez en quel guise,\r\n    quant hom le volt cacer\r\n    et prendre et enginner,\r\n    si vent horn al orest\r\n    u sis repaires est;\r\n    la met une pucele\r\n    hors de sein sa mamele,\r\n    e par odurement\r\n    monosceros la sent;\r\n    dune vent a la pucele,\r\n    si baiset sa mamele,\r\n    en sun devant se dort,\r\n    issi vent a sa mort;\r\n    li hom survent atant,\r\n    ki l'ocit en dormant,\r\n    u trestut vif le prent,\r\n    si fait puis sun talent.\r\n    grant chose signefie,\r\n    ne larei nel vus die.\r\n      Monosceros griu est,\r\n    en franceis un-corn est:\r\n    beste de tel baillie\r\n    Jhesu Crist signefie;\r\n    un deu est e serat\r\n    e fud e parmaindrat;\r\n    en la virgine se mist,\r\n    e pur hom charn i prist,\r\n    e pur virginited,\r\n    pur mustrer casteed,\r\n    a virgine se parut\r\n    e virgine le conceut.\r\n    virgine est e serat\r\n    e tuz jurz parmaindrat.\r\n    ores oez brefment\r\n    le signefiement.\r\n      Ceste beste en verte\r\n    nus signefie de;\r\n    la virgine signefie,\r\n    sacez, sancte Marie;\r\n    par sa mamele entent\r\n    sancte eglise ensement;\r\n    e puis par le baiser\r\n    ceo deit signefier,\r\n    que hom quant il se dort\r\n    en semblance est de mort:\r\n    des cum home dormi,\r\n    ki en cruiz mort sufri,\r\n    ert sa destructiun\r\n    nostre redemptiun,\r\n    e sun traveillement\r\n    nostre reposement.\r\n    si deceut des diable\r\n    par semblant cuvenable;\r\n    anme e cors sunt un,\r\n    issi fud des et hum,\r\n    e iceo signefie\r\n    beste de tel baillie.\r\n\r\n_Bestiaries_ and _Computs_ (the French title of the Chronologies) were\r\nfor some time the favourites with didactic verse writers, but before\r\nlong the whole encyclopaedia, as it was then understood, was turned into\r\nverse. Astrology, hunting, geography, law, medicine, history, the art of\r\nwar, all had their treatises; and latterly _Tresors_, or complete\r\npopular educators, as they would be called nowadays, were composed, the\r\nbest-known of which is that of Walter of Metz in 1245.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moral and Theological verse.]\r\n\r\nAll, or almost all, these works, written as they were in an age\r\nsincerely pious, if somewhat grotesque in its piety, and theoretically\r\nmoral, if somewhat loose in its practice, contained not only abundant\r\nmoralising, but also more or less theology of the mystical kind. It\r\nwould therefore have been strange if ethics and theology themselves had\r\nwanted special exponents in verse. Before the middle of the twelfth\r\ncentury Samson of Nanteuil (again an Englishman by residence) had\r\nversified the Proverbs of Solomon, and in the latter half of the same\r\ncentury vernacular lives of the saints begin to be numerous. Perhaps the\r\nmost popular of these was the legend of Barlaam and Josaphat, of which\r\nthe fullest poetical form has been left us by an English trouvere of the\r\nthirteenth century named Chardry, by whom we have also a verse rendering\r\nof the 'Seven Sleepers,' and some other poems[84]. Somewhat earlier,\r\nHermann of Valenciennes was a fertile author of this sort of work,\r\ncomposing a great _Bible de Sapience_ or versification of the Old\r\nTestament, and a large number of lives of saints. Of books of Eastern\r\norigin, one of the most important was the _Castoiement d'un Pere a son\r\nFils_, which comes from the _Panchatantra_, though not directly. The\r\ntranslated work had great vogue, and set the example of other\r\n_Castoiements_ or warnings. The monk Helinand at the end of the twelfth\r\ncentury composed a poem on 'Death,' and a vast number of similar poems\r\nmight be mentioned. The commonest perhaps of all is a dialogue _Des\r\ntrois Morts et des trois Vifs_, which exists in an astonishing number of\r\nvariants. Gradually the tone of all this work becomes more and more\r\nallegorical. _Dreams, Mirrors, Castles_, such as the 'Castle of Seven\r\nFlowers,' a poem on the virtues, make their appearance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Allegorical verse.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman de la Rose.]\r\n\r\nThe question of the origin of this habit of allegorising and\r\npersonification is one which has been often incidentally discussed by\r\nliterary historians, but which has never been exhaustively treated. It\r\nis certain that, at a very early period in the middle ages, it makes its\r\nappearance, though it is not in full flourishing until the thirteenth\r\ncentury. It seems to have been a reflection in light literature of the\r\nsame attitude of mind which led to the development of the scholastic\r\nphilosophy, and, as in the case of that philosophy, Byzantine and\r\nEastern influences may have been at work. Certain it is that in some of\r\nthe later Greek romances[85], something very like the imagery of the\r\n_Roman de la Rose_ is discoverable. Perhaps, however, we need not look\r\nfurther than to the natural result of leisure, mental activity, and\r\nliterary skill, working upon a very small stock of positive knowledge,\r\nand restrained by circumstances within a very narrow range of\r\nemployment. However this may be, the allegorising habit manifests itself\r\nrecognisably enough in French literature towards the close of the\r\ntwelfth century. In the _Meraugis de Portlesguez_ of Raoul de Houdenc,\r\nthe passion for arguing out abstract questions of lovelore is\r\nexemplified, and in the _Roman des Eles_ of the same author the knightly\r\nvirtues are definitely personified, or at least allegorised. At the same\r\ntime some at all events of the Troubadours, especially Peire Wilhem,\r\ncarried the practice yet further. _Merci_, _Pudeur_, _Loyaute_, are\r\nintroduced by that poet as persons whom he met as he rode on his\r\ntravels. In Thibaut de Champagne a still further advance was made. The\r\nrepresentative poem of this allegorical literature, and moreover one of\r\nthe most remarkable compositions furnished by the mediaeval period in\r\nFrance, is the _Roman de la Rose_[86]. It is doubtful whether any other\r\npoem of such a length has ever attained a popularity so wide and so\r\nenduring. The _Roman de la Rose_ extends to more than twenty thousand\r\nlines, and is written in a very peculiar style; yet it maintained its\r\nvogue, not merely in France but throughout Europe, for nearly three\r\nhundred years from the date of its commencement, and for more than two\r\nhundred from that of its conclusion. The history of the composition of\r\nthe poem is singular. It was begun by William of Lorris, of whom little\r\nor nothing is known, but whose work must, so far as it is easy to make\r\nout, have been done before 1240, and is sometimes fixed at 1237. This\r\nportion extends to 4670 lines, and ends quite abruptly. About forty\r\nyears later, Jean de Meung, or Clopinel, afterwards one of Philippe le\r\nBel's paid men of letters, continued it without preface, taking up\r\nWilliam of Lorris' cue, and extended it to 22,817 verses, preserving the\r\nmetre and some of the personages, but entirely altering the spirit of\r\nthe treatment. The importance of the poem requires that such brief\r\nanalysis as space will allow shall be given here. Its general import is\r\nsufficiently indicated by the heading,--\r\n\r\n    Ci est le Rommant de la Rose\r\n    Ou l'art d'amors est tote enclose;\r\n\r\nthough the rage for allegory induced its readers to moralise even its\r\nallegorical character, and to indulge in various far-fetched\r\nexplanations of it. In the twentieth year of his age, the author says,\r\nhe fell asleep and dreamed a dream. He had left the city on a fair May\r\nmorning, and walked abroad till he came to a garden fenced in with a\r\nhigh wall. On the wall were portrayed figures, Hatred, _Felonnie_,\r\n_Villonie_, Covetousness, Avarice, Envy, Sadness, Old Age, _Papelardie_\r\n(Hypocrisy), Poverty--all of which are described at length. He strives\r\nto enter in, and at last finds a barred wicket at which he is admitted\r\nby Dame Oiseuse (Leisure), who tells him that Deduit (Delight) and his\r\ncompany are within. He finds the company dancing and singing, Dame\r\nLiesse (Enjoyment) being the chief songstress, while Courtesy greets him\r\nand invites him to take part in the festival. The god of love himself is\r\nthen described, with many of his suite--Beauty, Riches, etc. A further\r\ndescription of the garden leads to the fountain of Narcissus, whose\r\nstory is told at length. By this the author, who is thenceforth called\r\nthe lover, sees and covets a rosebud. But thorns and thistles bar his\r\nway to it, and the god of love pierces him with his arrows. He does\r\nhomage to the god, who accepts his service, and addresses a long\r\ndiscourse to him on his future duties and conduct. The prospect somewhat\r\nalarms him, when a new personage, Bel Acueil (Gracious Reception), comes\r\nup and tenders his services to the lover, the god having disappeared.\r\nAlmost immediately, however, Dangier[87] makes his appearance, and\r\ndrives both the lover and Bel Acueil out of the garden. As the former\r\nis bewailing his fate, Reason appears and remonstrates with him. He\r\npersists in his desire, and parleys with Dangier, both directly and by\r\nambassadors, so that in the end he is brought back by Bel Acueil into\r\nthe garden and allowed to see but not to touch the rose. Venus comes to\r\nhis aid, and he is further allowed to kiss it. At this, however, Shame,\r\nJealousy, and other evil agents reproach Dangier. Bel Acueil is immured\r\nin a tower, and the lover is once more driven forth.\r\n\r\nHere the portion due to William of Lorris ends. Its main characteristics\r\nhave been indicated by this sketch, except that the extreme beauty and\r\ngrace of the lavish descriptions which enclose and adorn the somewhat\r\ncommonplace allegory perforce escape analysis. It is in these\r\ndescriptions, and in a certain tenderness and elegance of general\r\nthought and expression, that the charm of the poem lies, and this is\r\nvery considerable. The deficiency of action, however, and the continual\r\nallegorising threaten to make it monotonous had it been much longer\r\ncontinued in the same strain.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that it was this consideration which determined Jean de\r\nMeung to adopt a different style. In his time literature was already\r\nagitated by violent social, political, and religious debates, and the\r\ntreasures of classical learning were becoming more and more commonly\r\nknown. But prose had not yet become a common literary vehicle, save for\r\nhistory, oratory, and romance, nor had the duty of treating one thing at\r\na time yet impressed itself strongly upon authors. Jean de Meung was\r\nsatirically disposed, was accomplished in all the learning of his day,\r\nand had strong political opinions. He determined accordingly to make the\r\npoem of Lorris, which was in all probability already popular, the\r\nvehicle of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn doing this he takes up the story as his predecessor had left it, at\r\nthe point where the lover, deprived of the support of Bel Acueil, and\r\nwith the suspicions of Dangier thoroughly aroused against him, lies\r\ndespairing without the walls of the delightful garden. Reason is once\r\nmore introduced, and protests as before, but in a different tone and\r\nmuch more lengthily. She preaches the disadvantages of love in a speech\r\nnearly four hundred lines long, followed by another double the length,\r\nand then by a dialogue in which the lover takes his share. The\r\ndifference of manner is felt at once. The allegory is kept up after a\r\nfashion, but instead of the graceful fantasies of William of Lorris, the\r\nstaple matter is either sharp and satirical views of actual life, or\r\nelse examples drawn indifferently from sacred and profane history. One\r\nspeech of Reason's, a thousand lines in length, consists of a collection\r\nof instances of this kind showing the mobility of fortune. At length she\r\nleaves the lover as she found him, 'melancolieux et dolant,' but\r\nunconvinced. Amis (the friend), who has appeared for a moment\r\npreviously, now reappears, and comforts him, also at great length,\r\ndwelling chiefly on the ways of women, concerning which much scandal is\r\ntalked. The scene with Reason had occupied nearly two thousand lines;\r\nthat with Amis extends to double that length, so that Jean de Meung had\r\nalready excelled his predecessor in this respect. Profiting by the\r\ncounsel he has received, the lover addresses himself to Riches, who\r\nguards the way, but fruitlessly. The god of love, however, takes pity on\r\nhim (slightly ridiculing him for having listened to Reason), and summons\r\nall his folk to attack the tower and free Bel Acueil. Among these Faux\r\nSemblant presents himself, and, after some parley, is received. This new\r\npersonification of hypocrisy gives occasion to some of the author's most\r\nsatirical touches as he describes his principles and practice. After\r\nthis, Faux Semblant and his companion, Contrainte Astenance (forced or\r\nfeigned abstinence), set to work in favour of the lover, and soon win\r\ntheir way into the tower. There they find an old woman who acts as Bel\r\nAcueil's keeper. She takes a message from them to Bel Acueil, and then\r\nengages in a singular conversation with her prisoner, wherein the\r\nsomewhat loose morality of the discourses of Amis is still further\r\nenforced by historical examples, and by paraphrases of not a few\r\npassages from Ovid. She afterward admits the lover, who thus, at nearly\r\nthe sixteen-thousandth line from the beginning, recovers through the\r\nhelp of False Seeming the 'gracious reception' which is to lead him to\r\nthe rose. The castle, however, is not taken, and Dangier, with the rest\r\nof his allegorical company, makes a stout resistance to 'Les Barons de\r\nL'Ost'--the lords of Love's army. The god sends to invoke the aid of his\r\nmother, and this introduces a new personage. Nature herself, and her\r\nconfidant, Genius, are brought on the scene, and nearly five thousand\r\nverses serve to convey all manner of thoughts and scraps of learning,\r\nmostly devoted to the support, as before, of questionably moral\r\ndoctrines. In these five thousand lines almost all the current ideas of\r\nthe middle ages on philosophy and natural science are more or less\r\nexplicitly contained. Finally, Venus arrives and, with her burning\r\nbrand, drives out Dangier and his crew, though even at this crisis of\r\nthe action the writer cannot refrain from telling the story of Pygmalion\r\nand the Image at length. The way being clear, the lover proceeds\r\nunmolested to gather the longed-for rose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popularity of the Roman de la Rose.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to exaggerate, and not easy to describe, the popularity\r\nwhich this poem enjoyed. Its attacks on womanhood and on morality\r\ngenerally provoked indeed not a few replies, of which the most important\r\ncame long afterwards from Christine de Pisan and from Gerson. But the\r\ngeneral taste was entirely in favour of it. Allegorical already, it was\r\nallegorised in fresh senses, even a religious meaning being given to it.\r\nThe numerous manuscripts which remain of it attest its popularity before\r\nthe days of printing. It was frequently printed by the earliest\r\ntypographers of France, and even in the sixteenth century it received a\r\nfresh lease of life at the hands of Marot, who re-edited it. Abroad it\r\nwas praised by Petrarch and translated by Chaucer[88]; and it is on the\r\nwhole not too much to say that for fully two centuries it was the\r\nfavourite book in the vernacular literature of Europe. Nor was it\r\nunworthy of this popularity. As has been pointed out, the grace of the\r\npart due to William of Lorris is remarkable, and the satirical vigour of\r\nthe part due to Jean de Meung perhaps more remarkable still. The\r\nallegorising and the length which repel readers of to-day did not\r\ndisgust generations whose favourite literary style was the allegorical,\r\nand who had abundance of leisure; but the real secret of its vogue, as\r\nof all such vogues, is that it faithfully held up the mirror to the\r\nlater middle ages. In no single book can that period of history be so\r\nconveniently studied. Its inherited religion and its nascent\r\nfree-thought; its thirst for knowledge and its lack of criticism; its\r\nsharp social divisions and its indistinct aspirations after liberty and\r\nequality; its traditional morality and asceticism, and its half-pagan,\r\nhalf-childish relish for the pleasures of sense; its romance and its\r\ncoarseness, all its weakness and all its strength, here appear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Imitations.]\r\n\r\nThe imitations of the _Roman de la Rose_ were in proportion to its\r\npopularity. Much of this imitation took place in other kinds of poetry,\r\nwhich will be noticed hereafter. Two poems, however, which are almost\r\ncontemporary with its earliest form, and which have only recently been\r\npublished, deserve mention. One, which is an obvious imitation of\r\nGuillaume de Lorris, but an imitation of considerable merit, is the\r\n_Roman de la Poire_[89], where the lover is besieged by Love in a tower.\r\nThe other, of a different class, and free from trace of direct\r\nimitation, is the short poem called _De Venus la Deesse d'Amors_[90],\r\nwritten in some three hundred four-lined stanzas, each with one rhyme\r\nonly. Some passages of this latter are very beautiful.\r\n\r\nThree extracts, two from the first part of the _Roman de la Rose_, and\r\none from the second, will show its style:--\r\n\r\n    En iceli tens deliteus,\r\n    Que tote riens d'amer s'esfroie,\r\n    Sonjai une nuit que j'estoie,\r\n    Ce m'iert avis en mon dormant,\r\n    Qu'il estoit matin durement;\r\n    De mon lit tantost me levai,\r\n    Chaucai-moi et mes mains lavai.\r\n    Lors trais une aguille d'argent\r\n    D'un aguiller mignot et gent,\r\n    Si pris l'aguille a enfiler.\r\n    Hors de vile oi talent d'aler,\r\n    Por oir des oisiaus les sons\r\n    Qui chantoient par ces boissons\r\n    En icele saison novele;\r\n    Cousant mes manches a videle,\r\n    M'en alai tot seus esbatant,\r\n    Et les oiseles escoutant,\r\n    Qui de chanter moult s'engoissoient\r\n    Par ces vergiers qui florissoient,\r\n    Jolis, gais et pleins de leesce.\r\n    Vers une riviere m'adresce\r\n    Que j'oi pres d'ilecques bruire.\r\n    Car ne me soi aillors deduire\r\n    Plus bel que sus cele riviere.\r\n    D'un tertre qui pres d'iluec iere\r\n    Descendoit l'iaue grant et roide,\r\n    Clere, bruiant et aussi froide\r\n    Comme puiz, ou comme fontaine,\r\n    Et estoit poi mendre de Saine,\r\n    Mes qu'ele iere plus espandue.\r\n    Onques mes n'avoie veue\r\n    Tele iaue qui si bien coroit:\r\n    Moult m'abelissoit et seoit\r\n    A regarder le leu plaisant.\r\n    De l'iaue clere et reluisant\r\n    Mon vis rafreschi et lave.\r\n    Si vi tot covert et pave\r\n    Le fons de l'iaue de gravele;\r\n    La praerie grant et bele\r\n    Tres au pie de l'iaue batoit.\r\n    Clere et serie et bele estoit\r\n    La matinee et atempree:\r\n    Lors m'en alai parmi la pree\r\n    Contreval l'iaue esbanoiant,\r\n    Tot le rivage costoiant.\r\n\r\n      *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n    Une ymage ot empres escrite,\r\n    Qui sembloit bien estre ypocrite,\r\n    _Papelardie_ ert apelee.\r\n    C'est cele qui en recelee,\r\n    Quant nus ne s'en puet prendre garde,\r\n    De nul mal faire ne se tarde.\r\n    El fait dehors le marmiteus,\r\n    Si a le vis simple et piteus,\r\n    Et semble sainte creature;\r\n    Mais sous ciel n'a male aventure\r\n    Qu'ele ne pense en son corage.\r\n    Moult la ressembloit bien l'ymage\r\n    Qui faite fu a sa semblance,\r\n    Qu'el fu de simple contenance;\r\n    Et si fu chaucie et vestue\r\n    Tout ainsinc cum fame rendue.\r\n    En sa main un sautier tenoit,\r\n    Et sachies que moult se penoit\r\n    De faire a Dieu prieres faintes,\r\n    Et d'appeler et sains et saintes.\r\n    El ne fu gaie ne jolive,\r\n    Ains fu par semblant ententive\r\n    Du tout a bonnes ovres faire;\r\n    Et si avoit vestu la haire.\r\n    Et sachies que n'iere pas grasse.\r\n    De jeuner sembloit estre lasse,\r\n    S'avoit la color pale et morte.\r\n    A li et as siens ert la porte\r\n    Deveee de Paradis;\r\n    Car icel gent si font lor vis\r\n    Amegrir, ce dit l'Evangile,\r\n    Por avoir loz parmi la vile,\r\n    Et por un poi de gloire vaine,\r\n    Qui lor toldra Dieu et son raine.\r\n\r\n      *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n    _Comment le traistre Faulx-Semblant\r\n    Si va les cueurs des gens emblant,\r\n    Pour ses vestemens noirs et gris,\r\n    Et pour son viz pasle amaisgris._\r\n    'Trop sai bien mes habiz changier,\r\n    Prendre l'un, et l'autre estrangier.\r\n    Or sui chevaliers, or sui moines,\r\n    Or sui prelas, or sui chanoines,\r\n    Or sui clers, autre ore sui prestres,\r\n    Or sui desciples, or sui mestres,\r\n    Or chastelains, or forestiers:\r\n    Briement, ge sui de tous mestiers.\r\n    Or resui princes, or sui pages,\r\n    Or sai parler trestous langages;\r\n    Autre ore sui viex et chenus,\r\n    Or resui jones devenus.\r\n    Or sui Robers, or sui Robins,\r\n    Or cordeliers, or jacobins.\r\n    Si pren por sivre ma compaigne\r\n    Qui me solace et acompaigne,\r\n    (C'est dame Astenance-Contrainte),\r\n    Autre desguiseure mainte,\r\n    Si cum il li vient a plesir\r\n    Por acomplir le sien desir.\r\n    Autre ore vest robe de fame;\r\n    Or sui damoisele, or sui dame,\r\n    Autre ore sui religieuse,\r\n    Or sui rendue, or sui prieuse,\r\n    Or sui nonain, or sui abesse,\r\n    Or sui novice, or sui professe;\r\n    Et vois par toutes regions\r\n    Cerchant toutes religions.

Towards the end of the twelfth or the\r\nbeginning of the thirteenth century a new class of narrative poems\r\narose, derived from each and all of these kinds, but marked by important\r\ndifferences. The new form immediately reacted on the forms which had\r\ngiven it birth, and produced new Chansons de Gestes, new Arthurian\r\nRomances, and new classical stories fashioned after its own image. This\r\nis what is called the Roman d'Aventures, of which the first and main\r\nfeature is open and almost avowed fictitiousness, and the second the\r\nmore or less complete abandonment of any attempt at cyclic arrangement\r\nor subordination to a central theme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Looser application of the term.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Classes of Romans d'Aventures.]\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently it was not unusual to apply the term Roman\r\nd'Aventures with less strictness, and to make it include the Romances of\r\nthe Round Table. There can, however, be no doubt that it is far better\r\nto adopt Jean Bodel's three classes as distinguishing into separate\r\ngroups the epic poetry of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and to\r\nrestrict the title Romans d'Aventures to the later narrative\r\ndevelopments of the thirteenth and fourteenth. For the second\r\ndistinguishing mark which we have just indicated is striking and of more\r\nor less universal application. In these later poems the ambition of the\r\nwriter to class his work under and with some precedent work is almost\r\nentirely absent. He allows himself complete freedom, though he may\r\nsometimes, in order to give his characters greater interest, connect\r\nthem nominally with some famous personage or event of the earlier\r\ncycles. This tendency to shake off the shackles of cyclicism is early\r\napparent. There are episodes even in the Chansons de Gestes which have\r\nlittle or no reference to Charlemagne or his peers: the Arthurian\r\nRomances in prose and verse contain long digressions, holding but very\r\nloosely to the Table Round, such as the adventures of Tristram and\r\nPercivale, and still more the singular episode of Grimaud in the _Saint\r\nGraal_. As for the third class, the Trouveres almost from the beginning\r\nassumed the greatest licence in their handling of the classical legends.\r\nThese accordingly were less affected than any others by the change. It\r\nis possible to divide the Romans d'Aventures themselves under the three\r\nheadings. It is further possible to indicate a large class of Chansons\r\nde Gestes over which the influence of the Roman d'Aventures has passed.\r\nBut the Chanson having a special formal peculiarity--the assonanced or\r\nrhymed tirade--survived the new influence better than the other two, and\r\nkeeps its name, and to some extent its character, while the Romances of\r\nArthur and antiquity are simply lost in the general body of tales of\r\nadventure. These tales are for the most part written in octosyllabic\r\ncouplets on the model of Chrestien, but a very few, such as _Brun de la\r\nMontaigne_, imitate the exterior characteristics of the Chanson.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be noticed that while the earlier poems are mostly\r\nanonymous, the Romans d'Aventures are generally, though not always,\r\nsigned, and bear characteristics of particular authorship. In some\r\ncases, notably in those of Adenes le Roi and Raoul de Houdenc, we have a\r\nbody of work signed or otherwise identified, which enables us to\r\nattribute a definite literary character and position to its authors.\r\nThis, as we have noted, is impossible in the case of the national epics,\r\nand not too easy in that of the Arthurian Romances. Until quite recently\r\nhowever the Roman d'Aventures has had less of the attention of editors\r\nthan its forerunners, and the works which compose the class are still to\r\nsome extent unpublished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adenes le Roi.]\r\n\r\nAdenes or Adans le Roi perhaps derived his surname from the function of\r\nking of the minstrels, if he performed it, at the court of Henry III,\r\nduke of Brabant. He was, most likely, born in the second quarter of the\r\nthirteenth century, and the last probable allusion to him which we have\r\noccurs in the year 1297. The events of his life are only known from his\r\nown poems, and consist chiefly of travels in company with different\r\nprincesses and princes of Flanders and Brabant. His literary work is\r\nhowever of great importance. It consists partly of refashionings of\r\nthree Chansons de Gestes, _Les enfances Ogier_, _Berte aus grans Pies_,\r\nand _Bueves de Commarchis_[91]. In these three poems Adenes works up the\r\nold epics into the form fashionable in his time, and as we possess the\r\nolder versions of the first and last, the comparison of the two forms\r\naffords a literary study of the highest interest. His last, longest, and\r\nmost important work is the Roman d'Aventures of _Cleomades_[92], a poem\r\nextending to 20,000 verses, and not less valuable for its intrinsic\r\nmerit than as a type of its class. Its popularity in the middle ages was\r\nimmense. Froissart gives it the place occupied in the _Inferno_ by\r\n_Lancelot_ in his description of his declaration of love to his\r\nmistress, and allusions to it under its second title of _Le Cheval de\r\nFust_[93] are frequent. The most prominent feature in the story is the\r\nintroduction of a wooden horse, like that known to everybody in the\r\nArabian Nights, which, started and guided by means of pegs, transports\r\nits rider whithersoever he will. Its great length allows of a very long\r\nseries of adventures, all of which are told in spirited and flowing\r\nverse, though with considerable prolixity and a certain abuse of stock\r\ndescriptions. These two faults characterise all the Romans d'Aventures\r\nand the Chansons which were remodelled in their style. The merits of\r\n_Cleomades_ are not so universally found, but its extreme length is not\r\ncommon. Few other Romans d'Aventures exceed 10,000 lines. An extract\r\nfrom this poem will well illustrate the manner of this important class\r\nof composition:--\r\n\r\n      Cleomades vit un chastel\r\n    encoste un plain, tres fort et bel,\r\n    ou il ot mainte bele tour.\r\n    bos et rivieres vit entour,\r\n    vignes et praieries grans.\r\n    mult fu li chastiaus bien seans.\r\n    la facon dou castel deisse,\r\n    mais je dout mult que ne meisse\r\n    trop longement au deviser:\r\n    pour ce m'en voel briement passer.\r\n      Du chastel vous dirai le non:\r\n    miols seant ne vit aine nus hom,\r\n    lors l'apieloit on Chastel-noble.\r\n    n'ot tel dusque en Constantinoble,\r\n    ne de la dusque en Osterice\r\n    n'ot plus bel, plus fort ne plus rice.\r\n    carmans a cel point i estoit\r\n    que Cleomades vint la droit.\r\n    forment li sambloit li chastiaus\r\n    de toutes pars riches et biaus.\r\n      Cleomades lors s'avisa\r\n    que viers le chastel se trera.\r\n    bien pensoit qu'en tel liu manoient\r\n    gent qui de grant afaire estoient.\r\n    che fu si qu'apries l'ajournee\r\n    mult faisoit bele matinee,\r\n    car mais estoit nouviaus entres:\r\n    c'est uns tans ki mult est ames\r\n    et de toutes gens conjois;\r\n    pour cou a non mais li jolis.\r\n    une tres grant tour haute et forte\r\n    avoit ases pries de la porte,\r\n    ki estoit couverte de plon,\r\n    plate deseure, car adon\r\n    les faisoit on ensi couvrir\r\n    pour engins et pour assallir.\r\n      Cleomades a avisee\r\n    la tour ki estoit haute et lee;\r\n    lors pense qu'il s'arestera\r\n    sor cele tour tant qu'il savra,\r\n    se il puet, la certainite\r\n    quel pais c'est la verite.\r\n    lors a son cheval adrechie\r\n    viers la tour de marbre entaillie.\r\n    les chevilletes si tourna\r\n    que droit sour la tour aresta.\r\n    si coiement s'est avales\r\n    que sour aighe coie vait nes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Raoul de Houdenc.]\r\n\r\nRaoul de Houdenc is an earlier poet than Adenes, and represents the\r\nRoman d'Aventures in its infancy, when it still found it necessary to\r\nattach itself to the great cycle of the Round Table. His works, besides\r\nsome shorter poems[94], consist of the _Roman des Eles_ (Ailes), a\r\nsemi-allegorical composition, describing the wings and feathers of\r\nchivalry, that is to say, the great chivalrous virtues, among which\r\nRaoul, like a herald as he was, gives Largesse the first place; of\r\n_Meraugis de Portlesguez_, an important composition, possessing some\r\nmarked peculiarities of style; and possibly also of the _Vengeance de\r\nRaguidel_, in which the author works out one of the innumerable\r\nunfinished episodes of the great epic of _Percevale_. Thus Raoul de\r\nHoudenc occupies no mean place in French literature, inasmuch as he\r\nindicates the starting-point of two great branches, the Roman\r\nd'Aventures and the allegorical poem, and this at a very early date.\r\nThis date is not known exactly; but it was certainly before 1228, when\r\nthe Trouvere Huon de Mery alludes to him, and classes him with Chrestien\r\nas a master of French verse. He has in truth some very noteworthy\r\npeculiarities. The chief of these, which must soon strike any reader of\r\n_Meraugis_, is his tendency to _enjambement_ or overlapping of couplets.\r\nIt is a curious feature in the history of French verse that the\r\nisolation of the couplet has constantly recurred in its history, and\r\nthat as constantly reformers have striven to break up the monotony so\r\nproduced by this process of _enjambement_. Perhaps Raoul is the earliest\r\nwho thus, as an indignant critic put it at the first representation of\r\n_Hernani_, 'broke up verses, and threw them out of window.' Besides this\r\nmetrical characteristic, the thing most noteworthy in his poems (as\r\nmight indeed have been expected from his composition of the _Roman des\r\nEles_) is a tendency to allegorising, and to scholastic disquisitions on\r\npoints of amatory casuistry. The whole plot of _Meraugis_ indeed turns\r\non the enquiry whether physical or metaphysical love is the sincerest,\r\nand on the quarrel which a difference on this point brings on between\r\nthe hero and Gorvein Cadrus his friend and his rival in the love of the\r\nfair Lidoine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chief Romans d'Aventures.]\r\n\r\nMany other Romans d'Aventures deserve mention, both for their intrinsic\r\nmerits and for the immense popularity they once enjoyed. Foremost among\r\nthese must be mentioned _Partenopex de Blois_[95] and _Flore et\r\nBlanchefleur_[96]. The former (formerly ascribed to Denis Pyramus and\r\nnow denied to him, but said to date from the twelfth century) is a kind\r\nof modernised _Cupid and Psyche_, except that Cupid's place is taken by\r\nthe fairy Melior, and Psyche's by the knight Parthenopeus or\r\nParthenopex. This poem has great elegance and freshness of style, and\r\nthough the author is inclined to moralise (as a near forerunner of the\r\n_Roman de la Rose_ was bound to do), his moralisings are gracefully and\r\nnaively put. _Flore et Blanchefleur_ is perhaps even superior. Its theme\r\nis the love of a young Christian prince for a Saracen girl-slave, who\r\nhas been brought up with him. She is sold into a fresh captivity to\r\nremove her from him, but he follows her and rescues her unharmed from\r\nthe harem of the Emir of Babylon. The delicacy of the handling is very\r\nremarkable in this poem, and it has some links of connection with\r\n_Aucassin et Nicolette_. _Le Roman de Dolopathos_[97] has a literary\r\nhistory of great interest which we need not touch upon here. Its\r\nversification has more vigour than that of almost any other Roman\r\nd'Aventures. _Blancandin et l'Orguilleuse d'Amour_[98] is more promising\r\nat the beginning than in the sequel. A young knight, hearing of the\r\npride and coyness of a lady, accosts and kisses her as she rides past\r\nwith a great following of knights. Her coldness is of course changed to\r\nlove at first sight, and the audacious suitor afterwards delivers her\r\nfrom her enemies; but the working out of the story is rather dully\r\nmanaged. _Brun de la Montaigne_[99], as has been already mentioned, is\r\nwritten in Chanson form, and deals with the famous Forest of Broceliande\r\nin Britanny. _Guillaume de Palerne_[100] is a still more interesting\r\nwork. It introduces the favourite mediaeval idea of lycanthropy, the\r\nhero being throughout helped and protected by a friendly were-wolf, who\r\nis before the end of the poem freed from the enchantment to which he is\r\nsubjected. This Romance was early translated into English. Of the same\r\nclass is the _Roman de l'Escouffle_, where a hawk carries away the\r\nheroine's ring, as in a well-known story of the Arabian Nights. _Amadas\r\net Idoine_[101] is one of the numerous histories of the success of a\r\nsquire of low degree, but is distinguished from most of them by the\r\noriginality of its conception and the vigour of its style. The scenes\r\nwhere the hero is recovered of his madness by his beloved, and where,\r\nkeeping guard over her tomb, he fights with ghostly enemies, after a\r\ntime of trial of his fidelity, and rescues her from death, are unusually\r\nbrilliant. _Le Bel Inconnu_[102], which (from a curious misunderstanding\r\nof its older form _Li Biaus Desconnus_) occurs in English form as\r\n_Lybius Diasconus_, tells the story of a son of Gawain and the fairy\r\nwith the white hands, and thus is one of the numerous secondary Romances\r\nof the Round Table. So also is the long and interesting _Roman du\r\nChevalier as Deux Espees_[103]; this extends to more than 12,000 lines,\r\nand, though the adventures recorded are of the ordinary Round Table\r\npattern, there is noticeable in it a better faculty of maintaining the\r\ninterest and a completer mastery over episodes than usual. A still\r\nlonger poem (also belonging to what may be called the outer Arthurian\r\ncycle) is _Durmart le Gallois_[104], which contains almost 16,000\r\nverses. The loves of the hero and Fenise, the Queen of Ireland, are\r\nsomewhat lengthily handled; but there are passages of merit, especially\r\none most striking episode in which the hero, riding through a forest by\r\nnight, comes to a tree covered from top to bottom with burning torches,\r\nwhile a shining naked child is enthroned on the summit. These touches of\r\nmystical religion are rarer in the later Romans d'Aventures than in the\r\nArthurian Romances proper, but with them one of the most remarkable\r\nelements of romance disappears. Philippe de Remy, Seigneur de Beaumanoir\r\n(who has other claims to literary distinction) is held to be author of\r\ntwo Romans d'Aventures[105], _La Manekine_ (the story of the King of\r\nHungary's daughter, who cut off her hand to save herself from her\r\nfather's incestuous passion) and _Blonde d'Oxford_, where a young French\r\nsquire carries off an English heiress. _Joufrois de Poitiers_[106],\r\nwhich has not come down to us complete, is chiefly remarkable for the\r\nliveliness of style with which adventures, in themselves tolerably\r\nhackneyed, are handled. Other Romans d'Aventures, which are either as\r\nyet in manuscript or of less importance, are _Ille et Galeron_ and\r\n_Eracle_, both by Gautier d'Arras, _Cristal et Larie_, _La Dame a la\r\nLicorne_, _Guy de Warwike_, _Gerard de Nevers_ or _La Violette_[107],\r\n_Guillaume de Dole_, _Eledus et Serena_, _Florimont_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Character.]\r\n\r\nLike most kinds of mediaeval poetry, these Romans d'Aventures have a\r\nvery considerable likeness the one to the other. It may indeed be said\r\nthat they possess a 'common form' of certain incidents and situations,\r\nwhich reappear with slight changes and omissions in all or most of them.\r\nTheir besetting sins are diffuseness and the recurrence of stock\r\ndescriptions and images. On the other hand, they have their peculiar\r\nmerits. The harmony of their versification is often very considerable;\r\ntheir language is supple, picturesque, and varied, and the moral\r\natmosphere which they breathe is one of agreeable refinement and\r\ncivilisation. In them perhaps is seen most clearly the fanciful and\r\ngraceful side of the state of things which we call chivalry. Its\r\nmystical and transcendental sides are less vividly and touchingly\r\nexhibited than in the older Arthurian Romances; and its higher passions\r\nare also less dealt with. The Romans d'Aventures supply once more,\r\naccording to the Aristotelian definition, an Odyssey to the Arthurian\r\nIliad; they are complex and deal with manners. Nor ought it to be\r\nomitted that, though they constantly handle questions of gallantry, and\r\nthough their uniform theme is love, the language employed on these\r\nsubjects is almost invariably delicate, and such as would not fail to\r\nsatisfy even modern standards of propriety. The courtesy which was held\r\nto be so great a knightly virtue, if it was not sufficient to ensure a\r\nhigh standard of morality in conduct, at any rate secured such a\r\nstandard in matter of expression. In this respect the Court literature\r\nof the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries stands in very remarkable\r\ncontrast to that which was tolerated, if not preferred, from the time of\r\nLouis the Eleventh until the reign of his successor fourteenth of the\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Last Chansons. Baudouin de Sebourc.]\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the influence which these poems had\r\non the Chansons de Gestes. Few of the later developments of these are\r\nworth much attention, but what may be called the last original Chanson\r\ndeserves some notice. _Baudouin de Sebourc_[108] and its sequel the\r\n_Bastard of Bouillon_[109] worthily close this great division of\r\nliterature, and, setting as they do a finish to the sub-cycle of the\r\n_Chevalier au Cygne_, hardly lose except in simplicity by comparison\r\nwith its magnificent opening in the _Chanson d'Antioche_. They contain\r\ntogether some 33,000 verses, and the scene changes freely. It is\r\nsometimes in Syria, where the Crusaders fight against the infidel,\r\nsometimes in France and Flanders, where Baudouin has adventures of all\r\nkinds, comic and chivalrous, sometimes on the sea, where among other\r\nthings the favourite mediaeval legend of St. Brandan's Isle is brought\r\nin. Not a little of its earlier part shows the sarcastic spirit common\r\nat the date of its composition, the beginning of the fourteenth century.\r\nThe length of the two poems is enormous, as has been said; but, putting\r\ntwo or three masterpieces aside, no poem of mediaeval times has a more\r\nvaried and livelier interest than _Baudouin de Sebourc_, and few breathe\r\nthe genuine Chanson spirit of pugnacious piety better than _Le Bastart\r\nde Bouillon_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[91] Ed.

By the end of the\r\nthirteenth century the chief original developments had lost their first\r\nvigour, while, on the other hand, the influence of the regular forms of\r\nProvencal poetry had had time to make itself fully felt. There arose in\r\nconsequence, in northern France, a number of artificial forms, the\r\norigin and date of which is somewhat obscure, but which rapidly attained\r\ngreat popularity, and which continued for fully two centuries almost to\r\nmonopolise the attention of poets who did not devote themselves to\r\nnarrative. These forms, the Ballade, the Rondeau, the Virelai, etc.,\r\nhave already been alluded to as making their appearance among the later\r\ngrowths of early lyrical poetry. They must now be treated in the\r\nabundant development which they received at the hands of a series of\r\npoets from Lescurel to Charles d'Orleans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Character. Varieties.]\r\n\r\nThe principle underlying all these forms is the same, that is to say,\r\nthe substitution for the half-articulate refrain of the early Romances,\r\nof a refrain forming part of the sense, and repeated with strict\r\nregularity at the end or in the middle of stanzas rigidly corresponding\r\nin length and constitution. In at least two cases, the _lai_ and the\r\n_pastourelle_, the names of earlier and less rigidly exact forms were\r\nborrowed for the newer schemes; but the more famous and prevailing\r\nmodels[110], the Ballade, with its modification the Chant Royal, and\r\nthe Rondel, with its modifications the Rondeau and the Triolet, are new.\r\nIt has been customary to see in the adoption of these forms a sign of\r\ndecadence; but this can hardly be sustained in face of the fact that, in\r\nCharles d'Orleans and Villon respectively, the Rondel and the Ballade\r\nwere the occasion of poetry far surpassing in vigour and in grace all\r\npreceding work of the kind, and also in presence of the service which\r\nthe sonnet--a form almost if not quite as artificial--has notoriously\r\ndone to poetry. It may be admitted, however, that the practitioners of\r\nthe Ballade and the Rondeau soon fell into puerile and inartistic\r\nover-refinements. The forms of Ballade known as Equivoquee, Fratrisee,\r\nCouronnee, etc., culminating in the preposterous Emperiere, are\r\nmonuments of tasteless ingenuity which cannot be surpassed in their\r\nkind, and they have accordingly perished. But both in France and in\r\nEngland the Ballade itself and a few other forms have retained\r\npopularity at intervals, and have at the present day broken out into\r\nfresh and vigorous life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jehannot de Lescurel.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guillaume de Machault.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eustache Deschamps]\r\n\r\nThe chief authors of these pieces during the period we are discussing\r\nwere Jehannot de Lescurel, Guillaume de Machault, Eustache Deschamps,\r\nJean Froissart, Christine de Pisan, Alain Chartier, and Charles\r\nd'Orleans. Besides these there were many others, though the epoch of\r\nthe Hundred Years' War was not altogether fertile in lighter poetry or\r\npoetry of any kind. Jehannot de Lescurel[111] is one of those poets of\r\nwhom absolutely nothing is known. His very name has only survived in the\r\ngeneral syllabus of contents of the manuscript which contains his works,\r\nand which is in this part incomplete. The thirty-three poems--sixteen\r\nBallades, fifteen Rondeaus[112], and two nondescript pieces--which exist\r\nare of singular grace, lightness, and elegance. They cannot be later and\r\nare probably earlier than the middle of the fourteenth century, and thus\r\nthey are anterior to most of the work of the school. Guillaume de\r\nMachault was a person sufficiently before the world, and his work is\r\nvery voluminous. As usual with all these poets, it contains many details\r\nof its author's life, and enables us to a certain extent to construct\r\nthat life out of these indications. Machault was probably born about\r\n1284, and may not have died till 1377. A native of Champagne and of\r\nnoble birth, he early entered, like most of the lesser nobility of the\r\nperiod, the service of great feudal lords. He was chamberlain to Philip\r\nthe Fair, and at his death became the secretary of John of Luxembourg,\r\nthe well-known king of Bohemia. After the death of this prince at\r\nCressy, he returned to the service of the court of France and served\r\nJohn and Charles V., finally, as it appears, becoming in some way\r\nconnected with Pierre de Lusignan, king of Cyprus. His works were very\r\nnumerous, amounting in all to some 80,000 lines, of which until recently\r\nnothing but a few extracts was in print. In the last few years, however,\r\n_La Prise d'Alexandrie_[113], a rhymed chronicle of the exploits of\r\nLusignan, and the _Voir Dit_[114], a curious love poem in the style of\r\nthe age, have been printed. Besides these his works include numerous\r\nballades, etc., and several long poems in the style of those of\r\nFroissart, shortly to be described. On the other hand, the works of\r\nEustache Deschamps, which are even more voluminous than those of\r\nMachault, his friend and master, are almost wholly composed of short\r\npieces, with one notable exception, the _Miroir de Mariage_, a poem of\r\n13,000 lines[115]. Deschamps has left no less than 1175 ballades, and as\r\nthe ballade usually contains twenty-four lines at least, and frequently\r\nthirty-four, this of itself gives a formidable total. Rondeaus,\r\nvirelais, etc., also proceeded in great numbers from his pen; and he\r\nwrote an important 'Art of Poetry,' a treatise rendered at once\r\nnecessary and popular by the fashion of artificial rhyming. The life of\r\nDeschamps was less varied than that of Machault, whose inferior he was\r\nin point of birth, but he held some important offices in his native\r\nprovince, Champagne. Both Deschamps and Machault exhibit strongly the\r\ncharacteristics of the time. Their ballades are for the most part either\r\nmoral or occasional in subject, and rarely display signs of much\r\nattention to elegance of phraseology or to weight and value of thought.\r\nIn the enormous volume of their works, amounting in all to nearly\r\n200,000 lines, and as yet mostly unpublished, there is to be found much\r\nthat is of interest indirectly, but less of intrinsic poetical worth.\r\nThe artificial forms in which they for the most part write specially\r\ninvite elegance of expression, point, and definiteness of thought,\r\nqualities in which both, but especially Deschamps, are too often\r\ndeficient. When, for instance, we find the poet in his anxiety to\r\ndiscourage swearing, filling, in imitation of two bad poets of his time,\r\none, if not two ballades[116] with a list of the chief oaths in use, it\r\nis difficult not to lament the lack of critical spirit displayed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Froissart.]\r\n\r\nFroissart, though inferior to Lescurel, and though far less remarkable\r\nas a poet than as a prose writer, can fairly hold his own with\r\nDeschamps and Machault, while he has the advantage of being easily\r\naccessible[117]. The later part of his life having been given up to\r\nhistory, he is not quite so voluminous in verse as his two predecessors.\r\nYet, if the attribution to him of the _Cour d' Amour_ and the _Tresor\r\nAmoureux_ be correct, he has left some 40,000 or 50,000 lines. The bulk\r\nof his work consists of long poems in the allegorical courtship of the\r\ntime, interspersed with shorter lyrical pieces in the prevailing forms.\r\nOne of these poems, the _Buisson de Jonece_, is interesting because of\r\nits autobiographical details; and some shorter pieces approaching more\r\nnearly to the _Fabliau_ style, _Le Dit du Florin_, _Le Debat du Cheval\r\net du Levrier_, etc., are sprightly and agreeable enough. For the most\r\npart, however, Froissart's poems, like almost all the poems of the\r\nperiod, suffer from the disproportion of their length to their matter.\r\nIf the romances of the time, which are certainly not destitute of\r\nincident, be tedious from the superabundance of prolix description, much\r\nmore tedious are these recitals of hyperbolical passion tricked out with\r\nall the already stale allegorical imagery of the _Roman de la Rose_ and\r\nwith inappropriate erudition of the fashion which Jean de Meung had\r\nconfirmed, if he did not set it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Christine de Pisan.]\r\n\r\nChristine de Pisan, who was born in 1363, was a pupil of Deschamps, as\r\nDeschamps had been a pupil of Machault. She was an industrious writer, a\r\nlearned person, and a good patriot, but not by any means a great\r\npoetess. So at least it would appear, though here again judgment has to\r\nbe formed on fragments, a complete edition of Christine never having\r\nbeen published, and even her separate poems being unprinted for the most\r\npart, or printed only in extract. Besides a collection of Ballades,\r\nRondeaux, and so forth, she wrote several _Dits_ (the _Dit de la\r\nPastoure_, the _Dit de Poissy_, the _Dittie de Jeanne d'Arc_, and some\r\n_Dits Moraux_), besides a _Mutation de Fortune_, a _Livre des Cent\r\nHistoires de Troie_, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alain Chartier.]\r\n\r\nAlain Chartier, who was born in or about 1390, and who died in 1458, is\r\nbest known by the famous story of Margaret of Scotland, queen of\r\nFrance, herself an industrious poetess, stooping to kiss his poetical\r\nlips as he lay asleep. He also awaits a modern editor. Like Froissart,\r\nhe devoted himself to allegorical and controversial love poems, and like\r\nChristine to moral verse. In the former he attained to considerable\r\nskill, and a ballade, which will presently be given, will show his\r\ncommand of dignified expression. On the whole he may be said to be the\r\nmost complete example of the scholarliness which tended more and more to\r\ncharacterise French poetry at this time, and which too often degenerated\r\ninto pedantry. Chartier is the first considerable writer of original\r\nwork who Latinises much; and his practice in this respect was eagerly\r\nfollowed by the _rhetoriqueur_ school both in prose and verse. He\r\nhimself observed due measure in it; but in the hands of his successors\r\nit degraded French to an almost Macaronic jargon.\r\n\r\nIn all the earlier work of this school not a little grace and elegance\r\nis discoverable, and this quality manifests itself most strongly in the\r\npoet who may be regarded as closing the strictly mediaeval series,\r\nCharles d'Orleans[118]. The life of this poet has been frequently told.\r\nAs far as we are concerned it falls into three divisions. In the first,\r\nwhen after his father's death he held the position of a great feudal\r\nprince almost independent of royal control, it is not recorded that he\r\nproduced any literary work. His long captivity in England was more\r\nfruitful, and during it he wrote both in French and in English. But the\r\nlast five-and-twenty years of his life, when he lived quietly and kept\r\ncourt at Blois (bringing about him the literary men of the time from\r\nBouciqualt to Villon, and engaging with them in poetical tournaments),\r\nwere the most productive. His undoubted work is not large, but the\r\npieces which compose it are among the best of their kind. He is fond, in\r\nthe allegorical language of the time, of alluding to his having 'put his\r\nhouse in the government of Nonchaloir,' and chosen that personage for\r\nhis master and protector. There is thus little fervency of passion\r\nabout him, but rather a graceful and somewhat indolent dallying with the\r\nsubjects he treats. Few early French poets are better known than Charles\r\nd'Orleans, and few deserve their popularity better. His Rondeaux on the\r\napproach of spring, on the coming of summer and such-like subjects,\r\ndeserve the very highest praise for delicate fancy and formal skill.\r\n\r\nOf poets of less importance, or whose names have not been preserved, the\r\namount of this formal poetry which remains to us is considerable. The\r\nbest-known collection of such work is the _Livre des Cent\r\nBallades_[119], believed, on tolerably satisfactory evidence, to have\r\nbeen composed by the famous knight-errant Bouciqualt and his companions\r\non their way to the fatal battle of Nicopolis. Before, however, the\r\nfifteenth century was far advanced, poetry of this formal kind fell into\r\nthe hands of professional authors in the strictest sense, _Grands\r\nRhetoriqueurs_ as they were called, who, as a later critic said of\r\nalmost the last of them, 'lost all the grace and elegance of the\r\ncomposition' in their elaborate rules and the pedantic language which\r\nthey employed. The complete decadence of poetry in which this resulted\r\nwill be treated partly in the summary following the present book, partly\r\nin the first chapter of the book which succeeds it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile this frail but graceful poetry may be illustrated by an\r\nirregular _Ballade_ from Lescurel, a _Chanson Balladee_ from Machault, a\r\n_Virelai_ from Deschamps, a _Ballade_ from Chartier, and a _Rondel_ from\r\nCharles d'Orleans.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEHANNOT DE LESCUREL.\r\n\r\n    Amour, voules-vous acorder\r\n    Que je muire pour bien amer?\r\n    Vo vouloir m'esteut agreer;\r\n

their more\r\nimportant developments. The _ballade_ consists of three stanzas, and an\r\n_envoy_, or final half-stanza, which is sometimes omitted. The number of\r\nthe lines in each stanza is optional, but it should not usually be more\r\nthan eleven or less than eight. The peculiarity of the poem is that the\r\nlast line of every stanza is identical, and that the rhymes are the same\r\nthroughout and repeated in the same order. The examples printed at the\r\nend of this chapter from Lescurel and Chartier will illustrate this\r\nsufficiently. There is no need to enter into the absurdity of _ballades\r\nequivoquees_, _emperieres_, etc., further than to say that their main\r\nprinciple is the repetition of the same rhyming word, in a different\r\nsense, it may be twice or thrice at the end of the line, it may be at\r\nthe end and in the middle, it may be at the end of one line and the\r\nbeginning of the next. The _chant royal_ is a kind of major ballade\r\nhaving five of the longest (eleven-lined) stanzas and an envoy of five\r\nlines. The _rondel_ is a poem of thirteen lines (sometimes made into\r\nfourteen by an extra repetition), consisting of two quatrains and a\r\nfive-lined stanza, the first two lines of the first quatrain being\r\nrepeated as the last two of the second, and the first line of all being\r\nadded once more at the end. The _rondeau_, a poem of thirteen, fourteen,\r\nor fifteen lines, is arranged in stanzas of five, four, and four, five,\r\nor six lines, the last line of the second and third stanzas consisting\r\nof the first words of the first line of the poem. The _triolet_ is a\r\nsort of rondel of eight lines only, repeating the first line at the\r\nfourth, and the first and second at the seventh and eighth. Lastly, the\r\n_villanelle_ alternates one of two refrain lines at the end of each\r\nthree-lined stanza. These are the principal forms, though there are many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[111] Ed. Montaiglon.

This is a\r\nvery interesting poem consisting of more than 9000 lines, mostly\r\noctosyllabic couplets, with ballades, etc. interspersed, one of which is\r\ngiven at the end of this chapter. It is addressed either to Agnes of\r\nNavarre, or, as M. P. Paris thought, to Peronelle d'Armentieres, and was\r\nwritten in 1362, when the author was probably very old.\r\n\r\n[115] Deschamps is said to have been also named Morel.

It has been attempted, on the one hand, to father the mysteries\r\nand miracle-plays of the twelfth and later centuries on the classical\r\ndrama, traditions of which are supposed to have been preserved in the\r\nmonasteries and other homes of learning. On the other hand, a more\r\nprobable and historical source has been found in the ceremonies and\r\nliturgies of the Church, which in themselves possess a considerable\r\ndramatic element, and which, as we shall see, were early adapted to\r\nstill more definitely dramatic purposes. Disputes of this kind, if not\r\nexactly otiose, are not suited to these pages; and it is sufficient to\r\nsay that while Plautus and Terence at least retained a considerable hold\r\non mediaeval students, the natural tendencies to dramatic representation\r\nwhich exist in almost every people, assisted by the stimulus of\r\necclesiastical traditions, ceremonies, and festivals, are probably\r\nsufficient to account for the beginnings of dramatic literature in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Earliest Vernacular Dramatic Forms.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mysteries and Miracles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miracles de la Vierge.]\r\n\r\nIt so happens too that such historical evidence as we have entirely\r\nbears out this supposition. The earliest compositions of a dramatic kind\r\nthat we possess in French, are arguments and scraps interpolated in\r\nLatin liturgies of a dramatic character. Earlier still these works had\r\nbeen wholly in Latin. The production called 'The Prophets of Christ' is\r\nheld to date from the eleventh century, and consists of a series of\r\nutterances of the prophets and patriarchs, who are called upon in turn\r\nto bear testimony in reference to the Messiah, according to a common\r\npatristic habit. By degrees other portions of Old Testament history were\r\nthrown into the dramatic or at least dialogic form. In the drama or\r\ndramatic liturgy of _Daniel_, fragments of French make their appearance,\r\nand the Mystery of _Adam_ is entirely in the vulgar tongue. Both these\r\nbelong to the twelfth century, and the latter appears to have been not\r\nmerely a part of the church services, but to have been independently\r\nperformed outside the church walls. It is accompanied by full directions\r\nin Latin for the decoration and arrangement of stage and scenes. Another\r\nimportant instance, already mentioned, of somewhat dubious age, but\r\ncertainly very early, is the Mystery of _The Ten Virgins_. This is not\r\nwholly in French, but contains some speeches in a Romance dialect. These\r\nthree dramas, _Daniel_, _Adam_, and _The Ten Virgins_, are the most\r\nancient specimens of their kind, which, from the thirteenth century\r\nonward, becomes very numerous and important. By degrees a distinction\r\nwas established between mystery and miracle-plays, the former being for\r\nthe most part taken from the sacred Scriptures, the latter from legends\r\nand lives of the Saints and of the Virgin. Early and interesting\r\nspecimens of the miracle are to be found in the _Theophile_ of\r\nRuteboeuf and in the _Saint Nicholas_ of Jean Bodel d'Arras, both\r\nbelonging to the same (thirteenth) century[120]. But the most remarkable\r\nexamples of the miracle-play are to be found in a manuscript which\r\ncontains forty miracles of the Virgin, dating from the fourteenth\r\ncentury. Selections from these have been published at different times,\r\nand the whole is now in course of publication by the Old French Text\r\nSociety[121]. As the miracles were mostly concerned with isolated\r\nlegends, they did not lend themselves to great prolixity, and it is rare\r\nto find them exceed 2000 lines. Their versification is at first somewhat\r\nlicentious, but by degrees they settled down into more or less regular\r\nemployment of the octosyllabic couplet. Both in them and in the\r\nmysteries the curious mixture of pathos and solemnity on the one side,\r\nwith farcical ribaldry on the other, which is characteristic of\r\nmediaeval times, early becomes apparent. The mysteries, however, as they\r\nbecame more and more a favourite employment of the time, increased and\r\ngrew in length. The narrative of the Scriptures being more or less\r\ncontinuous, it was natural that the small dramas on separate subjects\r\nshould by degrees be attracted to one another and be merged in larger\r\nwholes. It was another marked characteristic of mediaeval times that all\r\nliterary work should be constantly subject to _remaniement_, the facile\r\nscribes of each day writing up the work of their predecessors to the\r\ntaste and demands of their own audience. In the case of the mysteries,\r\nas in that of the _Chansons de Gestes_, each _remaniement_ resulted in a\r\nlengthening of the original. It became an understood thing that a\r\nmystery lasted several days in the representation; and in many\r\nprovincial towns regular theatres were constructed for the performances,\r\nwhich remained ready for use between the various festival times. In the\r\nform which these representations finally assumed in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, they not only required elaborate scenery and properties, but\r\nalso in many cases a very large troop of performers. It is from this\r\ncentury that most of the mysteries we possess date, and they are all\r\ncharacterised by enormous length. The two most famous of these are the\r\n_Passion_[122] of Arnould Greban, and the _Viel Testament_[123], due to\r\nno certain author. The _Passion_, as originally written in the middle of\r\nthe fifteenth century, consisted of some 25,000 lines, and thirty or\r\nforty years later it was nearly doubled in length by the alterations of\r\nJean Michel. The _Mystere du Viel Testament_, of which no manuscript is\r\nnow known, but which was printed in the last year of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, is now being reprinted, and extends to nearly 50,000 verses.\r\nAdditions even to this are spoken of; and Michel's _Passion_,\r\nsupplemented by a _Resurrection_, extended to nearly 70,000 lines, which\r\nvast total is believed to have been frequently acted as a whole. In such\r\na case the space of weeks rather than days, which is said to have been\r\nsometimes occupied in the performance of a mystery, cannot be thought\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Heterogeneous Character of Mysteries.]\r\n\r\nThe enormous length of the larger mysteries makes analysis of any one of\r\nthem impossible; but as an instance of the curious comedy which is\r\nintermixed with their most serious portions, and which shocked critics\r\neven up to our own time, we may take the scene of the Tower of Babel in\r\nthe _Mystere du Viel Testament_[124]. Here the author is not content\r\nwith describing Nimrod's act in general terms, or by the aid of the\r\nconvenient messenger; he brings the actual masons and carpenters on the\r\nstage. _Gaste-Bois_ (Spoilwood), _Casse-Tuileau_ (Breaktile), and their\r\nmates talk before us for nearly 200 lines, while Nimrod and others come\r\nin from time to time and hasten on the work. The workmen are quite\r\noutspoken on the matter. They do not altogether like the job; and one of\r\nthem says,\r\n\r\n    On ne peut en fin que faillir.\r\n    Besongnons; mais qu'on nous paie bien.\r\n\r\nA little further on and they are actually at work. One calls for a hod\r\nof mortar, another for his hammer. The labourers supply their wants, or\r\nmake jokes to the effect that they would rather bring them something to\r\ndrink. So it goes on, till suddenly the confusion of tongues falls upon\r\nthem, and they issue their orders in what is probably pure jargon,\r\nthough fragments of something like Italian can be made out. In the very\r\nmiddle of this scene occurs a really fine and reverently written\r\ndialogue between Justice and Mercy pleading respectively to the Divinity\r\nfor vengeance and pardon. Instances such as this abound in the\r\nmysteries, which are sometimes avowedly interrupted in order that the\r\naudience may be diverted by a farcical interlude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Argument of a Miracle Play.]\r\n\r\nOf the miracles, that of _St. Guillaume du Desert_ will serve as a fair\r\nexample. It is but 1500 lines in length, yet the list of _dramatis\r\npersonae_ extends to nearly thirty, and there are at least as many\r\ndistinct scenes. William, count of Poitiers and duke of Aquitaine, has\r\nrendered himself in many ways obnoxious to the Holy See. He has\r\nrecognised an anti-pope, has driven a bishop from his diocese for\r\nrefusing to do likewise, and has offended against morality. An embassy,\r\nincluding St. Bernard, is therefore sent from Rome to warn and correct\r\nhim. William is not proof against their eloquence, and soon becomes\r\ndeeply penitent. He quits his palaces, and retires to the society of\r\nhermits in the wilderness. These enjoin penances upon him. He is to have\r\na heavy hauberk immovably riveted on his bare flesh, and with sackcloth\r\nfor an overcoat to visit Rome and beg the Pope's forgiveness. He does\r\nthis, and the Pope sends him to the patriarch of Jerusalem, William\r\ntaking the additional penance as a proof of the heinousness of his sin.\r\nAfter this he retires by himself into a solitary place. Here, however, a\r\nknight of his country seeks him out, represents the anarchy into which\r\nit has fallen in his absence, and implores him to return. But this is\r\nnot William's notion of duty. He refuses, and to be free from such\r\nimportunities in future, retires to the island of Rhodes, and there\r\nlives in solitude. Irritated at the idea of his escaping them, Satan and\r\nBeelzebub attack him and beat him severely; but he recovers by the\r\nVirgin's intervention, and serves as a model to young devotees who seek\r\nhis cell, and like him become hermits. At last a chorus of saints\r\ndescends to see his godly end, which takes place in the presence of the\r\nneophytes. The events, of which this is a very brief abstract, are all\r\nclearly indicated in the short space of 1500 verses, many of which are\r\nonly of four syllables[125]. There is of course no attempt at drawing\r\nany figure, except that of the saint, at full length, and this is\r\ncharacteristic of the class. But as dramatised legends, for they are\r\nlittle more, these miracles possess no slight merit.\r\n\r\nThe general literary peculiarities of the miracle and mystery plays do\r\nnot differ greatly from those of other compositions in verse of the same\r\ntime which have been already described. Their great fault is prolixity.\r\nIn the collection of the _Miracles de la Vierge_, the comparative\r\nbrevity of the pieces renders them easier to read than the long\r\ncompositions of the fifteenth century, and the poetical beauty of some\r\nof the legends which they tell is sufficient to furnish them with\r\ninterest. Even in these, however, the absence of point and of dignity\r\nin the expression frequently mars the effect; and this is still more the\r\ncase with the longer mysteries. Of these latter, however, the work of\r\nthe brothers Greban--for there were two, Arnould and Simon,\r\nconcerned--contains passages superior to the general run, and in others\r\nlines and even scenes of merit occur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Profane Drama.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adam de la Halle.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the existence of the drama as an actual fact was for a long\r\ntime due to the performance and popularity of the mysteries and\r\nmiracles, specimens of dramatic work with purely profane subjects are to\r\nbe found at a comparatively early date. Adam de la Halle, so far as our\r\npresent information goes, has the credit of inventing two separate\r\nstyles of such composition[126]. In _Li Jus de la Feuillie_ he has left\r\nus the earliest comedy in the vulgar tongue known; in the pastoral drama\r\nof _Robin et Marion_ the earliest specimen of comic opera. Independently\r\nof the improbability that the drama, once in full practice, should be\r\narbitrarily confined to a single class of subject, there were many germs\r\nof dramatic composition in mediaeval literature which wanted but a\r\nlittle encouragement to develop themselves. The verse dialogues and\r\n_debats_, which both troubadours and trouveres had favoured, were in\r\nthemselves incompletely dramatic. The _pastourelles_, an extremely\r\nfavourite and fashionable class of composition, must have suggested to\r\nothers besides the Hunchback of Arras the idea of dramatising them; and\r\nthe early and strongly-marked partiality of the middle ages for pageants\r\nand shows of all kinds could hardly fail to induce those who planned\r\nthem to intersperse dialogue.\r\n\r\nThe plot of _Robin et Marion_ is simple and in a way regular. The\r\nordinary incidents of a _pastourelle_, the meeting of a fair shepherdess\r\nand a passing knight, the wooing (in this case an unsuccessful one) and\r\nthe riding away, are all there. The piece is completed by a kind of\r\nrustic picnic, in which the neighbouring shepherds and shepherdesses\r\njoin and disport themselves. Marion is a very graceful and amiable\r\nfigure; Robin a sheepish coward, who is not in the least worthy of her.\r\nIn Adam's other and earlier drama he is by no means so partial to the\r\nfeminine sex, and his work, though equally fresh and vigorous, is more\r\ncomplex and less artistically finished. It is in part autobiographic,\r\nand introduces Adam confessing to friends with sufficient effrontery his\r\nintention of going to Paris and deserting his wife. This part contains a\r\nvery pretty though curiously unsuitable description of the wooing, which\r\nhas such an unlucky termination. Suddenly, however, the author\r\nintroduces his father, an old citizen, who is quite ready to encourage\r\nhis son in his evil ways provided it costs him nothing, and the piece\r\nloses all regularity of plot. Divers citizens of Arras, male and female,\r\nare introduced with a more or less satiric intention, and the last\r\nepisode brings in the personages of Morgue la Fee and of the _mesnie_\r\n(attendants) of a certain shadowy King Hellequin. There is a doctor,\r\ntoo, whose revelations of his patients' affairs are sufficiently comic,\r\nnot to say farcical. Destitute as it is of method, and approaching more\r\nnearly to the Fabliau than to any other division of mediaeval literature\r\nin the coarseness of its language, the piece has great interest, not\r\nmerely because of its date and its apparent originality, but because of\r\nnumerous passages of distinct literary merit. The picture of the\r\nneglected wife in her girlhood is inferior to nothing of the kind even\r\nin the thirteenth century, that fertile epoch of early French poetry.\r\nThe father, too, Maitre Henri, the earliest of his kind on the modern\r\nstage, has traits which the great comic masters would not disown.\r\n\r\nThe classes of later secular drama may be thus divided,--the monologue,\r\nthe farce, the morality, the _sotie_, the profane mystery. The first\r\nfour of these constitute one of the most interesting divisions of early\r\nFrench literature; and it is to be hoped that before long easy access\r\nwill be afforded to the whole of it. The last is only interesting from\r\nthe point of view of literary history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monologues.]\r\n\r\nThe monologue is the simplest form of dramatic composition and needs but\r\nlittle notice, though it seems to have met with some favour from\r\nplaygoers of the time. By dint also of adroit changes of costume and\r\nassistance from scenery, etc., the monologue was sometimes made more\r\ncomplicated than appears at first sight possible, as for instance, in\r\nthe _Monologue du Bien et du Mal des Dames_, where the speaker plays\r\nsuccessively the parts of two advocates and of a judge. The monologue,\r\nhowever, more often consisted in a dramatisation of the earlier _dit_,\r\nin which some person or thing is made to declare its own attributes. Of\r\nvery similar character is the so-called _sermon joyeux_, which, however,\r\npreserves more or less the form of an address from the pulpit, of course\r\ntravestied and applied to ludicrous subjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Farces.]\r\n\r\nThe farce, on the other hand, is one of the most important of all\r\ndramatic kinds in reference to French literature. It is a genuine\r\nproduct of the soil, and proved the ancestor of all the best comedy of\r\nFrance, on which foreign models had very little influence. Until the\r\ndiscovery and acquisition by the British Museum of a unique collection\r\nof farces the number of these compositions known to exist was not large,\r\nand such as had been printed were difficult of access. It is still not\r\neasy to get together a complete collection, but the reimpression of the\r\nBritish Museum pieces in the _Bibliotheque Elzevirienne_[127] with M.\r\nEd. Fournier's _Theatre avant la Renaissance_[128] contains ample\r\nmaterials for judgment. In all, we possess about a hundred farces, most\r\nof which are probably the composition of the fifteenth century, though\r\nit is possible that some of them may date from the end of the\r\nfourteenth. The most famous of all early French farces, that of\r\n_Pathelin_, belongs, it is believed, to the middle or earlier part of\r\nthe fifteenth, and speaking generally, this century is the most\r\nproductive of theatrical work, at least of such as remains to us. The\r\nsubjects of these farces are of the widest possible diversity. In their\r\ngeneral character they at once recall the Fabliaux, and no one who reads\r\nmany of them can doubt that the one _genre_ is the immediate successor\r\nof the other. The farce, like the Fabliau, deals with an actual or\r\npossible incident of ordinary life to which a comic complexion is given\r\nby the treatment. The length of these compositions is very variable, but\r\nthe average is perhaps about five hundred lines. Their versification is\r\nalways octosyllabic and regular. But a curious peculiarity is found in\r\nmost of them as well as in a few contemporary dramas of the serious\r\nkind. From time to time the speeches of the characters are dovetailed\r\ninto one another so as to make up the Triolet (or rondeau of eight lines\r\nwith triple repetition of the first and double repetition of the\r\nsecond), a form which in the fifteenth, seventeenth, and nineteenth\r\ncenturies has been a favourite with French poets of the lighter kind.\r\nThe number of personages is never large; it sometimes falls as low as\r\ntwo (in which case the farce might in strictness be called, as it\r\nsometimes is, a _debat_ or dialogue), and rarely, if ever, rises above\r\nfour or five. From what has already been said it will be seen that it is\r\nnot easy to give any general summary of the subjects of this curious\r\ncomposition. Conjugal differences of one kind and another make up a very\r\nlarge part of them, but by no means the whole, and there are few aspects\r\nof contemporary bourgeois life which do not come in for treatment. As an\r\nexample we may take the _Farce du Paste de la Tarte_[129]. The\r\ncharacters are two thieves, a pastry-cook, and his wife. The farce opens\r\nwith a lamentable Triolet, in which the two thieves bewail their unhappy\r\nstate. Immediately afterwards, the pastry-cook, in front of whose shop\r\nthe scene is laid, calls to his wife and tells her that an eel-pie is to\r\nbe kept for him, and that he will send for it later, as he intends to\r\ndine abroad. The two thieves overhear the conversation, and the token\r\nwhich is to be given by the messenger, and after trying in vain to beg a\r\ndinner, determine to filch one. Thief the second goes to the\r\npastry-cook's wife, gives the appointed token, and easily obtains the\r\npie, upon which both feast. Unluckily, however, this does not satisfy\r\nthem, and the successful thief, remembering a fine tart which he has\r\nseen in the shop, decides that the possession of it would much improve\r\ntheir dinner. He persuades his companion to try and secure it.\r\nMeanwhile, however, the enraged pastry-cook has come home hungry and\r\ndemands his eel-pie. His wife in vain assures him that she has sent it\r\nby the messenger who brought his token. Her husband disbelieves her;\r\nwords run high, and are followed by blows. At this juncture the first\r\nthief appears and demands the tart, whereupon the irate pastry-cook\r\nturns his rage upon him. The stick makes him confess the device, and\r\nsmarting under the blows, he is easily induced to make his companion a\r\nsharer in his own sorrows. This is effected by an obvious stratagem. The\r\npastry-cook thus avenges himself of both his enemies, who however, with\r\nsome philosophy, console themselves with the fact that, after all, they\r\nhave had an excellent dinner without paying for it.\r\n\r\nThis piece serves as a fair example of the more miscellaneous farces, in\r\nalmost all of which the stick plays a prominent part, a part which it\r\nmay be observed retained its prominence at least till the time of\r\nMoliere. Of the farces dealing with conjugal matters, one of the most\r\ndecent, and perhaps the most amusing of all, is the _Farce du Cuvier_,\r\nwhich has nothing to do with the story under the same title which may be\r\nfound (possibly taken from Apuleius) in Boccaccio, and in the Fabliaux.\r\nIn the farce a hen-pecked husband is obliged by his wife to accept a\r\nlong list of duties which he is to perform. Soon afterwards she by\r\naccident falls into the washing-tub, and to all her cries for help he\r\nreplies 'cela n'est point a mon rollet' (schedule). Not a few also are\r\ndirected against the clergy, and these as a rule are the most licentious\r\nof all. It is, however, rare to find any one which is not more or less\r\namusing; and students of Moliere in particular will find analogies and\r\nresemblances of the most striking kind to many of his motives. It is,\r\nindeed, pretty certain that these pieces did not go out of fashion until\r\nMoliere's own time. The titles of some of the early and now lost pieces\r\nwhich his company for so many years played in the provinces are\r\nimmediately suggestive of the old farces to any one who knows the\r\nlatter. The farce was moreover a very far-reaching kind of composition.\r\nAs a rule the satire which it contains is directed against classes, such\r\nas women, the clergy, pedants, and so forth, who had nothing directly to\r\ndo with politics, and it is thus, more or less directly, the ancestor of\r\nthe comedy of manners. It is never, properly speaking, political, even\r\nindirect allusions to politics being excluded from it. It relies wholly\r\nupon domestic and personal interests. Not a few farces, such as that of\r\nwhich we have given a sketch, turn upon the same subject as the _Repues\r\nFranches_ attributed to Villon, and deal with the ingenious methods\r\nadopted by persons who hang loose upon society for securing their daily\r\nbread. Others attack the fertile subject of domestic service, and\r\nfurnish not a few parallels to Swift's _Directions_. Every now and then\r\nhowever we come across a farce, or at least a piece bearing the title,\r\nin which a more allegorical style of treatment is attempted. Such is the\r\nfarce of _Folle Bobance_, in which the tendency of various classes to\r\nloose and light living is satirised amusingly enough. A gentleman, a\r\nmerchant, a farmer, are all caught by the seductive offers of Folle\r\nBobance, and are not long before they repent it. Such again is the\r\n_Farce des Theologastres_, in which the students of the Paris\r\ntheological colleges are ridiculed, the _Farce de la Pippee,_ and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moralities.]\r\n\r\nIn strictness, however, those pieces where allegorical personages make\r\ntheir appearance are not farces but moralities. These compositions were\r\nexceedingly popular in the later middle ages, and their popularity was a\r\nnatural sequence of the rage for allegorising which had made itself\r\nevident in very early times, and had in the _Roman de la Rose_ dominated\r\nalmost all other literary tastes. The taste for personification and\r\nabstraction has always lent itself easily enough to satire, and in the\r\nfifteenth century pieces under the designation of moralities became very\r\ncommon. We do not possess nearly as many specimens of the morality as of\r\nthe farce, but, on the other hand, the morality is often, though not\r\nalways, a much longer composition than the farce. The subjects of\r\nmoralities include not merely private vices and follies, but almost all\r\nactual and possible defects of Church and State, and occasionally the\r\nterm is applied to pieces, the characters of which are not abstractions,\r\nbut which tell a story with a more or less moral turn. Sometimes these\r\npieces ran to a very great length, and one is quoted, _L'Homme Juste et\r\nl'Homme Mondain_, which contains 36,000 lines, and must, like the longer\r\nmysteries, have occupied days or even weeks in acting. A morality\r\nhowever, on the average, consisted of about 2000 lines, and its\r\npersonages were proportionally more numerous than those of the farce.\r\nThus the _Moralite des Enfans de Maintenant_ contains thirteen\r\ncharacters who are indifferently abstract and concrete; Maintenant,\r\nMignotte, Bon Advis, Instruction, Finet, Malduit, Discipline, Jabien,\r\nLuxure, Bonte, Desespoir, Perdition, and the Fool. This list almost\r\nsufficiently explains the plot, which simply recounts the persistence of\r\none child in evil and his bad end, with the repentance of the other. The\r\nmoralities have the widest diversity of subject, but most of them are\r\ntolerably clearly explained by their titles. _La Condamnation de\r\nBanquet_ is a rather spirited satire on gluttony and open housekeeping.\r\n_Marchebeau_ attacks the disbanded soldiery of the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century. _Charite_ points out the evils which have come into\r\nthe world for lack of charity. _La Moralite d'une Femme qui avait voulu\r\ntrahir la Cite de Romme_ is built on the lines of a miracle-play.\r\n_Science et Asnerye_ is a very lively satire representing the superior\r\nchances which the followers of _Asnerye_--ignorance--have of obtaining\r\nbenefices and posts of honour and profit as compared with those of\r\nlearning. _Mundus, caro, daemonia_, again tells its own tale. _Les\r\nBlasphemateurs_, which is very well spoken of, but has not been\r\nreprinted, rests on the popular legend upon which _Don Juan_ is also\r\nbased. In short, unless a complete catalogue were given, there is no\r\nmeans of fully describing the numerous works of this class.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soties.]\r\n\r\nThe Sotie is a class of much more idiosyncrasy. Although we have very\r\nfew Soties (not at present more than a dozen accessible to the student),\r\nalthough the contents of this class are as a rule duller even than those\r\nof the moralities, and infinitely inferior in attraction to those of the\r\nfarces, yet the Sotie has the merit of possessing a much more distinct\r\nand peculiar form. It is essentially political comedy, and it has the\r\npeculiarity of being played by stock personages, like an Italian comedy\r\nof the early kind. The Sotie, at least in its purely political form,\r\nwas, as might be expected, not very long lived. Its most celebrated\r\nauthor was Gringore, and his Sotie, which forms part of _Le Jeu du\r\nPrince des Sots et Mere Sotte_, is still the typical example of the\r\nkind. Besides these two characters (who represent, roughly speaking, the\r\ntemporal and spiritual powers), we have in this piece, Sotte Commune,\r\nthe common people; Sotte Fiance, false confidence; Sotte Occasion, who\r\nexplains herself; and a good many other allegorical personages, such as\r\nthe Seigneur de Gayete, etc. These pieces, however, are for the most\r\npart so entirely occasional that their chief literary interest lies in\r\ntheir curious stock personages. It should, however, be observed that of\r\nthe few Soties which we possess by no means all correspond to this\r\ndescription, some of them being indistinguishable from moralities. A\r\ncurious detail is that the various pieces we have been mentioning were\r\nsometimes, in representation, combined after the fashion of a regular\r\ntetralogy. First came a monologue or _cry_ containing a kind of\r\nproclamation. This was followed by the Sotie itself; then followed the\r\nmorality, and lastly a farce. The work of Gringore, just noticed, forms\r\npart of such a tetralogy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Profane Mysteries.]\r\n\r\nThe profane mysteries may be briefly despatched. They were the natural\r\nresult of the vogue of the mysteries proper, with which they vie in\r\nprolixity. Some of them were based on history or romance, such as, for\r\ninstance, the Mystery of _Troy_. Others corresponded pretty nearly to\r\nthe history plays of our own dramatists at a later period. Such is the\r\nMystery of the _Siege of Orleans_ which versifies and dramatises, at a\r\ndate very shortly subsequent to the actual events, the account of them\r\nalready made public in different chronicles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Societies of Actors.]\r\n\r\nOf considerable interest and importance in connection with these early\r\nforms of drama is the subject of the persons and societies by whom they\r\nwere represented, a subject upon which it is necessary to say a few\r\nwords. At first, as we have seen, the actors were members or dependents\r\nof the clergy. As the mysteries increased in bulk and demanded larger\r\ncompanies, their representation fell more and more into the hands of the\r\nlaity, even women in not a few cases acting parts, though this was\r\nrather the exception than the rule. It became not unusual for the\r\nguilds, which play such an important part in the social history of the\r\nmiddle ages, to undertake the task, and at last regular societies of\r\nactors were formed. The most famous of these, the _Confrerie de la\r\nPassion_ (whose first object was to play the mystery, or rather cycle of\r\nmysteries, known by that name), was licensed in 1402, and in the course\r\nof the fifteenth century a very large number of rival bodies were more\r\nor less formally constituted. The clerks of the Bazoche, or Palace of\r\nJustice, had long been dramatically inclined, but it was not till this\r\ntime that they were recognised as, so to speak, the patentees of a\r\npeculiar form of drama which in their case was the morality. The\r\n_Enfants sans Souci_, young men of good families in the city, devoted\r\nthemselves rather to the Sotie, and the stock personages of that curious\r\nform correspond to the official titles of the officers of their guild.\r\nBesides these, many other similar but less durable and regularly\r\nconstituted societies arose, whose heads took fantastic titles, such as\r\nEmpereur de Galilee, Roi de l'Epinette, Prince de l'Etrille, and so\r\nforth. No one of these, however, attained the importance of the\r\nConfraternity of the Passion. This was chiefly composed of tradesmen and\r\ncitizens of Paris, and for a hundred and fifty years it continued to\r\nplay for the most part mysteries, sacred and profane alike, but the\r\nlatter, according to its name and profession, less commonly. In 1548 a\r\ncurious example of the change of times and manners took place, owing in\r\nall probability to the influence, direct or indirect, of the\r\nReformation. The Confraternity had its charter renewed, but it was\r\nexpressly forbidden to play the sacred dramas which it had been\r\noriginally constituted to perform. Thenceforward secular plays only were\r\nlawful in Paris, but the older dramas continued for a long time to be\r\nperformed in the provinces, and in Britanny have been acted within the\r\nlast half century. The Confraternity became regular actors of ordinary\r\nfarces, and as time went on were known under the title of the Comedians\r\nof the Hotel de Bourgogne, a name which brings us at once into the\r\npresence of Moliere. In these last sentences we have a little\r\noutstripped the mediaeval period proper, but in dramatic matters there\r\nis no gap between the ancient and modern theatre until we arrive at the\r\nPleiade.\r\n\r\nIt is not very easy to illustrate the manner of the ancient French drama\r\nby citations within ordinary compass; but the following passages, the\r\nfirst from the Mystery of the _Passion_, the second from the original\r\nform of _Pathelin_, may serve the purpose:--\r\n\r\n        _Ici deschargent Jesus de la croix._\r\n\r\n    _Simon._ or avant donc, puis que ainsi va.\r\n      je ferai vostre voulente;\r\n      mais il me poise en verite\r\n      de la honte que vous me faictes.\r\n      o Jesus, de tous les prophettes\r\n      le plus sainct et le plus begnin,\r\n      vous venes a piteuse fin,\r\n      veue vostre vie vertueeuse\r\n      quant vostre croix dure et honteuse\r\n      pour vostre mort fault que je porte.\r\n      se c'est a tort, je m'en rapporte\r\n      a ceulx qui vous ont forjuge.\r\n        _Ici charge la croix a Simon._\r\n\r\n    _Nembroth._ Messeigneurs, il est bien charge;\r\n      cheminons, depeschons la voie.\r\n\r\n    _Salmanazar._ j'ai grant desir que je le voie\r\n      fiche en ce hault tabernacle,\r\n      a scavoir s'il fera miracle,\r\n      quant il sera cloue dessus.\r\n\r\n    _Jeroboam._ seigneurs, hastes moi ce Jesus\r\n      et ces deux larrons aux coustes.\r\n      s'ilz ne vuellent, si les battez\r\n      si bien qu'il n'y ait que redire.\r\n\r\n    _Claquedent._ a cela ne tiendra pas, sire.\r\n      nos en ferons nostre povoir.\r\n\r\n    _Ici porte Simon une partie de la croix et\r\n      Jesus l'autre et le battent les sergens._\r\n\r\n    _Dieu le pere._ Pitie doit tout cueur esmouvoir\r\n      en lamenter piteusement\r\n      le martyre et le gref tourment\r\n      que Jesus, mon chier filz, endure.\r\n      il porte detresse tant dure,\r\n      que, puis que le monde dura,\r\n      homme si dure n'endura,\r\n      laquelle ne peult plus durer\r\n      sans la mort honteuse endurer,\r\n      et n'aura son sainct corps duree\r\n      tant qu'il ait la mort enduree,\r\n      il appert, car plus va durant,\r\n      et plus est tourment endurant,\r\n      sans quelque confort qui l'alege.\r\n      si convient que la mort abrege\r\n      et de l'executer s'apreste,\r\n      pour satiffaire a la requeste\r\n      de dame Justice severe,\r\n      qui pour requeste ne priere\r\n      ne veult rien de ses drois quitter.\r\n      Michel, alles donc conforter\r\n      en ceste amere passion\r\n      mon filz, plain de dilection,\r\n      qui veult dure mort en gre predre\r\n      et va sa doulce chair estrandre\r\n      ou puissant arbre de la croix.\r\n\r\n    _Sainct Michel._ pere du ciel et roi des rois,\r\n      humblement a chere assimplie\r\n      sera parfaicte et acomplie\r\n      vostre voulente juste et bonne.\r\n      _Ici descendent les anges de paradis._\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Path._ ce bergier ne peut nullement\r\n      respondre aux fais que l'on propose,\r\n      s'il n'a du conseil; et il n'ose\r\n      ou il ne scet en demander.\r\n      s'il vous plaisoit moy commander\r\n      que je fusse a luy, je y seroye.\r\n\r\n    _Juge._ avecques luy?

A complete collection of farces, _soties_,\r\netc. is hoped for from the Old French Text Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nPROSE CHRONICLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beginning of Prose Chronicles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grandes Chroniques de France.]\r\n\r\nIn all countries the use of prose for literature is chronologically\r\nlater than the use of poetry, and France is no exception to the rule.\r\nThe Chansons de Gestes were in their way historical poems, and they\r\nwere, as we have seen, soon followed by directly historical poems in\r\nconsiderable numbers. It was not, however, till the prose Arthurian\r\nromances of Map and his followers had made prose popular as a vehicle\r\nfor long narratives, that regular history began to be written in the\r\nvulgar tongue. The vogue of these prose romances dates from the latter\r\nportion of the twelfth century; the prose chronicle follows it closely,\r\nand dates from the beginning of the thirteenth. It was not at first\r\noriginal. The practice of chronicle writing in Latin had been frequent\r\nduring the earlier centuries, and at last the monks of three\r\nmonasteries, St. Benoit sur Loire, St. Germain des Pres, and St. Denis,\r\nbegan to keep a regular register of the events of their own time,\r\nconnecting this with earlier chronicles of the past. The most famous and\r\ndignified of the three, St. Denis, became specially the home of history.\r\nThe earliest French prose chronicles do not, however, come from this\r\nplace. They are two in number; both date from the earliest years of the\r\nthirteenth century, and both are translations. One is a version of a\r\nLatin compilation of Merovingian history; the other of the famous\r\nchronicle of _Turpin_[131]. These two are composed in a southern\r\ndialect bordering on the Provencal, and the first was either written by\r\nor ascribed to a certain Nicholas of Senlis. The example was followed,\r\nbut it was not till 1274 that a complete vernacular version of the\r\nhistory of France was executed by a monk of St. Denis--Primat--in French\r\nprose. This version, slightly modified, became the original of a\r\ncompilation very famous in French literature and history, the _Grandes\r\nChroniques de France_, which was regularly continued by members of the\r\nsame community until the reign of Charles V, from official sources and\r\nunder royal authority. The work, under the same title but written by\r\nlaics, extends further to the reign of Louis XI. The necessity of\r\ntranslation ceased as soon as the example of writing in the vernacular\r\nhad been set, though Latin chronicles continued to be produced as well\r\nas French.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Villehardouin.]\r\n\r\nLong, however, before history on the great scale had been thus\r\nattempted, and very soon after the first attempt of Nicholas of Senlis\r\nhad shown that the vulgar tongue was capable of such use, original prose\r\nmemoirs and chronicles of contemporary events had been produced, and, as\r\nhappens more than once in French literature, the first, or one of the\r\nfirst, was also the best. The _Conquete de Constantinoble_[132] of\r\nGeoffroy de Villehardouin was written in all probability during the\r\nfirst decade of the thirteenth century. Its author was born at\r\nVillehardouin, near Troyes, about 1160, and died, it would seem, in his\r\nGreek fief of Messinople in 1213. His book contains a history of the\r\nFourth Crusade, which resulted in no action against the infidels, but in\r\nthe establishment for the time of a Latin empire and in the partition of\r\nGreece among French barons. Villehardouin's memoirs are by universal\r\nconsent among the most attractive works of the middle ages. Although no\r\nactually original manuscript exists, we possess a copy which to all\r\nappearance faithfully represents the original. To readers, who before\r\napproaching Villehardouin have well acquainted themselves with the\r\ncharacteristics of the Chansons de Gestes, the resemblance of the\r\n_Conquete de Constantinoble_ to these latter is exceedingly striking.\r\nThe form, putting the difference between prose and verse aside, is very\r\nsimilar, and the merits of vigorous and brightly coloured language, of\r\nsimplicity and vividness of presentation, are identical. At the same\r\ntime either his own genius or the form which he has adopted has saved\r\nVillehardouin from the crying defect of most mediaeval work, prolixity\r\nand monotony. He has much to say as well as a striking manner of saying\r\nit, and the interest of his work as a story yields in nothing to its\r\npicturesqueness as a piece of literary composition. His indirect as well\r\nas direct literary value is moreover very great, because he enables us\r\nto see that the picture of manners and thought given by the Chansons de\r\nGestes is in the main strictly true to the actual habits of the\r\ntime--the time, that is to say, of their composition, not of their\r\nnominal subjects. Villehardouin is the chief literary exponent of the\r\nfirst stage of chivalry, the stage in which adventure was an actual fact\r\nopen to every one, and when Eastern Europe and Western Asia offered to\r\nthe wandering knight opportunities quite as tempting as those which the\r\nromances asserted to have been open to the champions of Charlemagne and\r\nArthur. But, as a faithful historian, he, while putting the poetical and\r\nattractive side of feudalism in the best light, does not in the least\r\nconceal its defects, especially the perpetual jarring and rivalry\r\ninevitable in armies where hundreds of petty kings sought each his own\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Chroniclers between Villehardouin and Joinville.]\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Crusade was fertile in chroniclers. Villehardouin's work was\r\nsupplemented by the chronicle of Henri de Valenciennes, which is written\r\nin a somewhat similar style, but with still more resemblance to the\r\nmanner and diction of the Chansons, so much so that it has been even\r\nsupposed, though probably without foundation, to be a rhymed Chanson\r\nthrown into a prose form. This process is known to have been actually\r\napplied in some cases. Another historian of the expedition whose work\r\nhas been preserved was Robert de Clari. Baldwin Count of Flanders, who\r\nalso accompanied it, was not indeed the author but the instigator of a\r\ntranslation of Latin chronicles which, like the _Grandes Chroniques de\r\nFrance_, was continued by original work and attained, under the title of\r\n_Chronique de Baudouin d'Avesnes_, very considerable dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth century also supplies a not inconsiderable number of\r\nworks dealing with the general history of France. Guillaume de Nangis\r\nwrote in the latter part of the century several historical treatises,\r\nfirst in Latin and then in French. An important work, entitled _La\r\nChronique de Rains_ (Rheims), dates from the middle of the period, and,\r\nthough less picturesque in subject and manner than Villehardouin, has\r\nconsiderable merits of style. Normandy, Flanders, and, the Crusades\r\ngenerally, each have groups of prose chronicles dealing with them, the\r\nmost remarkable of the latter being a very early French translation of\r\nthe work of William of Tyre, with additions[133]. Of the Flanders group,\r\nthe already mentioned chronicle called of Baudouin d'Avesnes is the\r\nchief. It is worth mentioning again because in its case we see the way\r\nin which French was gaining ground. It exists both in Latin and in the\r\nvernacular. In other cases the Latin would be the original; but in this\r\ncase it appears, though it is not positively certain, that the book was\r\nwritten in French, and translated for the benefit of those who might\r\nhappen not to understand that language.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joinville.]\r\n\r\nAs Villehardouin is the representative writer of the twelfth century, so\r\nis Joinville[134] of the thirteenth, as far as history is concerned.\r\nJean de Joinville, Senechal of Champagne, was born in 1224 at the castle\r\nof Joinville on the Marne, which afterwards became the property of the\r\nOrleans family, and was destroyed during the Revolution. He died in\r\n1319. He accompanied Saint Louis on his unfortunate crusade in 1248,\r\nbut not in his final and fatal expedition to Tunis. Most of the few\r\nlater events of his life known to us were connected with the\r\ncanonisation of the king; but he is known to have taken part in active\r\nservice when past his ninetieth year. His historical work, a biography\r\nof St. Louis, deals chiefly with the crusade, and is one of the most\r\ncircumstantial records we have of mediaeval life and thought. It is of\r\nmuch greater bulk than Villehardouin's _Conquete_, and is composed upon\r\na different principle, the author being somewhat addicted to gossip and\r\napt to digress from the main course of his narrative. It has, however,\r\nto be remembered that Joinville's first object was not, like\r\nVillehardouin's, to give an account of a single and definite enterprise,\r\nbut to display the character of his hero, to which end a certain amount\r\nof desultoriness was necessary and desirable. His style has less vigour\r\nthan that of his countryman and predecessor, but it has more grace. It\r\nis evident that Joinville occasionally set himself with deliberate\r\npurpose to describe things in a literary fashion, and his interspersed\r\nreflections on manners and political subjects considerably increase the\r\nmaterial value of his work. It is unfortunate that nothing like a\r\ncontemporary manuscript has come down to us, the earliest in existence\r\nbeing one of the late fourteenth century, when considerable changes had\r\npassed over the language. With the aid of some contemporary documents on\r\nmatters of business which Joinville seems to have dictated, M. de Wailly\r\nhas effected an exceedingly ingenious conjectural restoration of the\r\ntext of the book, but the interest of this is in strictness diminished\r\nby the fact that it is undoubtedly conjectural. The period of\r\ncomposition of Joinville's book was somewhat late in his life,\r\napparently in the first years of the fourteenth century, and about 1310\r\nhe presented it to Louis le Hutin, though it does not appear what became\r\nof the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe period between Joinville and Froissart is peculiarly barren in\r\nchronicles. Besides the serial publications already noticed, the\r\n_Chroniques de France_ and the _Chroniques de Flandre_, there are\r\nperhaps only two which are worth mentioning. The first is a _Chronique\r\ndes Quatre Premiers Valois_, written with exactness and careful\r\nattention to authentic sources of information. The other is the\r\n_Chronique_ of Jean Lebel, canon of Liege. This is not only a work of\r\nconsiderable merit in itself, but still more remarkable because it was\r\nthe model, and something more, of Froissart. That historian began by\r\nalmost paraphrasing the work of Lebel; and though by degrees he worked\r\nthe early parts of his book into more and more original forms according\r\nto the information which he picked up, these parts remained to the last\r\nindebted to the author from whom they had been originally compiled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Froissart.]\r\n\r\nFroissart was born in 1337 and did not die till after 1409, the precise\r\ndate of his death being unknown. There are few problems of literary\r\ncriticism which are more difficult than that of arranging a definitive\r\nedition of his famous Chroniques[135]. In most cases the task of the\r\ncritic is to decide which of several manuscripts, all long posterior to\r\nthe author's death, deserves most confidence, or how to supply and\r\ncorrect the faults of a single document. In Froissart's case there is,\r\non the contrary, an embarrassing number of seemingly authentic texts.\r\nDuring the whole of his long life, Froissart seems to have been\r\nconstantly occupied in altering, improving, and rectifying his work, and\r\ncopies of it in all its states are plentiful. The early printed editions\r\nrepresent merely a single one of these; Buchon's is somewhat more\r\ncomplete. But it is only within the last few years that the labours of\r\nM. Kervyn de Lettenhove and M. Simeon Luce have made it possible (and\r\nnot yet entirely possible) to see the work in all its conditions. M.\r\nKervyn de Lettenhove's edition is complete and excellent as far as it\r\ngoes. That of M. Luce is still far from finished. The editor, however,\r\nhas succeeded in presenting three distinct versions of the first book.\r\nThis is the most interesting in substance, the least in manner and\r\nstyle. It deals with a period most of which lay outside of Froissart's\r\nown knowledge, and in treating which he was at first content to\r\nparaphrase Jean Lebel, though afterwards he made this part of the book\r\nmuch more his own. It never, however, attained to the gossiping\r\npicturesqueness of the later books (there are four in all), in which the\r\nhistorian relies entirely on his own collections. Although Cressy,\r\nPoitiers, and Najara may be of more importance than the fruitless\r\n_chevauchee_ of Buckingham through France, the gossip of the Count de\r\nFoix' court, and the kite-and-crow battles of the Duke de Berri and his\r\nofficers with Aymerigot Marcel and Geoffrey Tete-Noire, they are much\r\nless characteristic of Froissart. The literary instinct of Scott enabled\r\nhim (in a speech of Claverhouse[136]) exactly to appreciate our author.\r\nSome of his admirers have striven to make out that traces of political\r\nwisdom are to be found in the later books. If it be so, they are very\r\ndeeply hidden. A sentence which must have been written when Froissart\r\nwas more than fifty years old puts his point of view very clearly.\r\nGeoffrey Tete-Noire, the Breton brigand, 'held a knight's life, or a\r\nsquire's, of no more account than a villain's,' and this is said as if\r\nit summed up the demerits of the free companion. Beyond knights and\r\nladies, tourneys and festivals, Froissart sees nothing at all. But his\r\nadmirable power of description enables him to put what he did see as\r\nwell as any writer has ever put it. Vast as his work is, the narrative\r\nand picturesque charm never fails; and in a thousand different lights\r\nthe same subject, the singular afterglow of chivalry, which the\r\ninfluence of certain English and French princes kept up in the\r\nfourteenth century, is presented with a mastery rare in any but the best\r\nliterature. He is so completely indifferent to anything but this, that\r\nhe does not take the slightest trouble to hide the misery and the\r\nmisgovernment which the practical carrying out of his idea caused.\r\nNever, perhaps, was there a better instance of a man of one idea, and\r\ncertainly there never was any man by whom his one idea was more\r\nattractively represented. To this day it is difficult even with the\r\nclearest knowledge of the facts to rise from a perusal of Froissart\r\nwithout an impression that the earlier period of the Hundred Years' War\r\nwas a sort of golden age in which all the virtues flourished, except for\r\noccasional ugly outbreaks of the evil principle in the Jacquerie, the\r\nWat Tyler insurrection, and so forth. As a historian Froissart is, as\r\nwe should expect, not critical, and he carries the French habit of\r\ndisfiguring proper names and ignoring geographical and other trifles to\r\na most bewildering extent. But there is little doubt that he was\r\ndiligent in collecting and careful in recording his facts, and his\r\nextreme minuteness often supplies gaps in less prolix chroniclers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fifteenth-Century Chroniclers.]\r\n\r\nThe last century of the period which is included in this chapter is\r\nextremely fertile in historians. These range themselves naturally in two\r\nclasses; those who undertake more or less of a general history of the\r\ncountry during their time, and those who devote themselves to special\r\npersons as biographers, or to the recital of the events which more\r\nparticularly concern a single city or district. The first class,\r\nmoreover, is more conveniently subdivided according to the side which\r\nthe chroniclers took on the great political duel of their period, the\r\nstruggle between Burgundy and France.\r\n\r\nThe Burgundian side was particularly rich in annalists. The study and\r\npractice of historical writing had, as a consequence of the Chronicle of\r\nBaudouin, and the success of Lebel and Froissart, taken deep root in the\r\ncities of Flanders which were subject to the Duke of Burgundy, while the\r\nmagnificence and opulence of the ducal court and establishments\r\nnaturally attracted men of letters. Froissart's immediate successor,\r\nEnguerrand de Monstrelet, belongs to this party. Monstrelet[137], who\r\nwrote a chronicle covering the years 1400-1444, is not remarkable for\r\nelegance or picturesqueness of style, but takes particular pains to copy\r\nexactly official reports of speeches, treaties, letters, etc. Another\r\nimportant chronicle of the same side is that of George Chastellain[138],\r\na busy man of letters, who was historiographer to the Duke of Burgundy,\r\nand wrote a history of the years 1419-1470. Chastellain was a man of\r\nlearning and talent, but was somewhat imbued with the heavy and pedantic\r\nstyle which both in poetry and prose was becoming fashionable. The\r\nmemoirs of Olivier de la Marche extend from 1435 to 1489, and are also\r\nsomewhat heavy, but less pedantic than those of Chastellain. Dealing\r\nwith the same period, and also written in the Burgundian interest, are\r\nthe memoirs of Jacques du Clerq, 1448-1467, and of Lefevre de Saint\r\nRemy, 1407-1436; as also the Chronicle of Jehan de Wavrin, beginning at\r\nthe earliest times and coming down to 1472. Wavrin's subject is\r\nnominally England, but the later part of his work of necessity concerns\r\nFrance also.\r\n\r\nThe writers on the royalist side are of less importance and less\r\nnumerous, though individually perhaps of equal value. The chief of them\r\nare Mathieu de Coucy, who continued the work of Monstrelet in a\r\ndifferent political spirit from 1444 to 1461; Pierre de Fenin, who wrote\r\na history of part of the reign of Charles VI; and Jean Juvenal des\r\nUrsins[139], a statesman and ecclesiastic, who has dealt more at length\r\nwith the whole of the same reign. Of these Juvenal des Ursins takes the\r\nfirst rank, and is one of the best authorities for his period; but from\r\na literary point of view he cannot be very highly spoken of, though\r\nthere is a certain simplicity about his manner which is superior to the\r\nelaborate pedantry of not a few of his contemporaries and immediate\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nThe second class has the longest list of names, and perhaps the most\r\ninteresting constituents. First may be mentioned _Le Livre des Faits et\r\nbonnes Moeurs du sage roi Charles V._ This is an elaborate panegyric\r\nby the poetess Christine de Pisan, full of learning, good sense, and\r\nsound morality, but somewhat injured by the classical phrases, the\r\nforeign idioms, and the miscellaneous erudition, which characterise the\r\nschool to which Christine belonged. Far more interesting is the _Livre\r\ndes Faits du Marechal de Bouciqualt_[140], a book which is a not\r\nunworthy companion and commentary to Froissart, exhibiting the kind of\r\nerrant chivalry which characterised the fourteenth century, and in part\r\nthe fifteenth, and which so greatly assisted the English in their\r\nconflicts with the French. Joan of Arc was made, as might have been\r\nexpected, the subject of numerous chronicles and memoirs which have come\r\ndown to us under the names of Cousinot, Cochon, and Berry. The Constable\r\nof Richemont, who had the credit of overthrowing the last remnant of\r\nEnglish domination at the battle of Formigny, found a biographer in\r\nGuillaume Gruel.\r\n\r\nLastly have to be mentioned three curious works of great value and\r\ninterest bearing on this time. These are the journals of a citizen of\r\nParis[141] (or two such), which extend from 1409 to 1422, and from 1424\r\nto 1440, and the so-called _Chronique scandaleuse_ of Jean de Troyes\r\ncovering the reign of Louis XI. These, with the already-mentioned\r\nchronicle of Juvenal des Ursins, are filled with the minutest\r\ninformation on all kinds of points. The prices of articles of\r\nmerchandise, the ravages of wolves, etc., are recorded, so that in them\r\nalmost as much light is thrown on the social life of the period as by a\r\nfile of modern newspapers. The chronicle of Jean Chartier, brother of\r\nAlain, that of Molinet in continuance of Chastellain, and the short\r\nmemoirs of Villeneuve, complete the list of works of this class that\r\ndeserve mention.\r\n\r\nExamples of the three great French historians of the middle ages\r\nfollow:--\r\n\r\n\r\nVILLEHARDOUIN.\r\n\r\n     La velle de la saint Martin vindrent devant Gadres en\r\n     Esclavonie, si virent la cite fermee de halz murs et de\r\n     haltes torz, et pour noiant demandissies plus bele ne plus\r\n     fort ne plus riche. et quant li pelerin la virent, il se\r\n     merveillerent mult et distrent li uns a l'autre 'coment\r\n     porroit estre prise tel vile par force, se diex meismes nel\r\n     fait?' Les premieres nes vindrent devant la vile et\r\n     aencrerent et atendirent les autres et al matin fist mult\r\n     bel jor et mult cler, et vinrent les galies totes et li\r\n     huissier et les autres nes qui estoient arrieres, et\r\n     pristrent le port par force et rompirent la chaaine qui mult\r\n     ere forz et bien atornee, et descendirent a terre, si que li\r\n     porz fu entr'aus et la vile. lor veissiez maint chevalier et\r\n     maint serjant issir des nes et maint bon destrier traire des\r\n     huissiers et maint riche tref et maint pavellon.\r\n\r\n     Einsine se loja l'oz et fu Gadres assegie le jor de la saint\r\n     Martin. a cele foiz ne furent mie venu tuit li baron, ear\r\n     encor n'ere mie venuz li marchis de Montferrat qui ere remes\r\n     arriere por afaire que il avoit.

Et quant ce oi\r\n     li dus, si en fu mult iriez et destroiz et dist as contes et\r\n     as barons 'seignor, je avoie de ceste vile plait a ma\r\n     volonte, et vostre gent le m'ont tolu et vos m'aviez convent\r\n     que vos le m'aideriez a conquerre, et je vos semoing que vos\r\n     le facoiz.'\r\n\r\n     Maintenant li conte et li baron parlerent ensemble et cil\r\n     qui a la lor partie se tenoient, et distrent 'mult ont fait\r\n     grant oltrage cil qui ont cest plait desfet, et il ne fu\r\n     onques jorz que il ne meissent paine a cest ost depecier. or\r\n     somes nos honi, se nos ne l'aidons a prendre.'

Quant li cheval\r\n     furent ens, nostre maistres notonniers escria a ses\r\n     notonniers qui estoient ou bec de la nef et lour dist 'est\r\n     aree vostre besoingne?' et il respondirent 'oil, sire,\r\n     vieingnent avant clerc et li provere.' Maintenant que il\r\n     furent venu, il lour escria 'chantez de par dieu'; et il\r\n     s'escrierent tuit a une voiz '_veni creator spiritus_.' et\r\n     il escria a ses notonniers 'faites voile de par dieu'; et il\r\n     si firent. et en brief tens li venz se feri ou voile et nous\r\n     ot tolu la veue de la terre, que nous ne veismes que ciel et\r\n     yaue: et chascun jour nous esloigna li venz des pais ou nous\r\n     avions estei neiz. et ces choses vous moustre je que cil\r\n     est bien fol hardis, qui se ose mettre en tel peril atout\r\n     autrui chatel ou en pechie mortel; ear l'on se dort le soir\r\n     la ou on ne set se l'on se trouvera ou font de la mer au\r\n     matin.\r\n\r\n     En la mer nous avint une fiere merveille, que nous trouvames\r\n     une montaigne toute ronde qui estoit devant Barbarie. nous\r\n     la trouvames entour l'eure de vespres et najames tout le\r\n     soir, et cuidames bien avoir fait plus de cinquante lieues,\r\n     et lendemain nous nous trouvames devant icelle meismes\r\n     montaigne; et ainsi nous avint par dous foiz ou par trois.\r\n     Quant li marinnier virent ce, il furent tuit esbahi et nous\r\n     distrent que nos neis estoient en grant peril; ear nous\r\n     estiens devant la terre aus Sarrazins de Barbarie.

Samedis\r\n     estoit: nous feismes la premiere procession entour les dous\r\n     maz de la nef; je meismes m'i fiz porter par les braz, pour\r\n     ce que je estoie grief malades. Onques puis nous ne veismes\r\n     la montaigne, et venimes en Cypre le tiers samedi.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROISSART.\r\n\r\n     Je fuis adont infourme par le seigneur d'Estonnevort, et me\r\n     dist que il vey, et aussi firent plusieurs, quant\r\n     l'oriflambe fut desploiee et la bruine se chey, ung blanc\r\n     coulon voller et faire plusieurs volz par dessus la baniere\r\n     du roy; et quant il eut assez vole, et que on se deubt\r\n     combatre et assambler aux ennemis, il se print a seoir sur\r\n     l'une des bannieres du roy; dont on tint ce a grant\r\n     signiffiance de bien. Or approchierent les Flamens et\r\n     commenchierent a jetter et a traire de bombardes et de\r\n     canons et de gros quarreaulx empenez d'arain; ainsi se\r\n     commenca la bataille. Et en ot le roy de France et ses gens\r\n     le premier encontre, qui leur fut moult dur; ear ces\r\n     Flamens, qui descendoient orgueilleusement et de grant\r\n     voulente, venoient roit et dur, et boutoient en venant de\r\n     l'espaule et de la poitrine ainsi comme senglers tous\r\n     foursenez, et estoient si fort entrelachies tous ensemble\r\n     qu'on ne les povoit ouvrir ne desrompre. La fuirent du coste\r\n     des Francois par le trait des canons, des bombardes et des\r\n     arbalestres premierement mort: le seigneur de Waurin,\r\n     baneret, Morelet de Halwin et Jacques d'Ere. Et adont fut la\r\n     bataille du roy reculee; mais l'avantgarde et l'arrieregarde\r\n     a deux lez passerent oultre et enclouirent ces Flamens, et\r\n     les misrent a l'estroit. Je vous diray comment sur ces deux\r\n     eles gens d'armes les commencierent a pousser de leurs\r\n     roides lances a longs fers et durs de Bourdeaulx, qui leur\r\n     passoient ces cottes de maille tout oultre et les perchoient\r\n     en char; dont ceulx qui estoient attains et navrez de ces\r\n     fers se restraindoient pour eschiever les horions; ear\r\n     jamais ou amender le peuissent ne se boutoient avant pour\r\n     eulx faire destruire. La les misrent ces gens d'armes a tel\r\n     destroit qu'ilz ne se scavoient ne povoient aidier ne ravoir\r\n     leurs bras ne leurs planchons pour ferir ne eulz deffendre.\r\n     La perdoient les plusieurs force et alaine, et la\r\n     tresbuchoient l'un sur l'autre, et se estindoient et\r\n     moroient sans coup ferir. La fut Phelippe d'Artevelle encloz\r\n     et pouse de glaive et abatu, et gens de Gand qui l'amoient\r\n     et gardoient grant plente atterrez entour luy. Quant le page\r\n     dudit Phelippe vey la mesadventure venir sur les leurs, il\r\n     estoit bien monte sur bon coursier, si se party et laissa\r\n     son maistre, ear il ne le povoit aidier; et retourna vers\r\n     Courtray pour revenir a Gand.\r\n\r\n     (A)insi fut faitte et assamblee celle bataille; et lors que\r\n     des deux costez les Flamens furent astrains et encloz, ilz\r\n     ne passerent plus avant, ear ilz ne se povoient aidier.\r\n     Adont se remist la bataille du roy en vigeur, qui avoit de\r\n     commencement ung petit bransle. La entendoient gens d'armes\r\n     a abatre Flamens en grant nombre, et avoient les plusieurs\r\n     haches acerees, dont ilz rompoient ces bachinets et\r\n     eschervelloient testes; et les aucuns plommees, dont ilz\r\n     donnoient si grans horrions, qu'ilz les abatoient a terre. A\r\n     paines estoient Flamens cheuz, quant pillars venoient qui\r\n     entre les gens d'armes se boutoient et portoient grandes\r\n     coutilles, dont ilz les partueoient; ne nulle pitie n'en\r\n     avoient non plus que se ce fuissent chiens. La estoit le\r\n     clicquetis sur ces bacinets si grant et si hault, d'espees,\r\n     de haches, et de plommees, que l'en n'y ouoit goutte pour la\r\n     noise. Et ouy dire que, se tous les heaumiers de Paris et de\r\n     Brouxelles estoient ensemble, leur mestier faisant, ilz\r\n     n'euissent pas fait si grant noise comme faisoient les\r\n     combatans et les ferans sur ces testes et sur ces bachinets.\r\n     La ne s'espargnoient point chevalliers ne escuiers ainchois\r\n     mettoient la main a l'euvre par grant voulente, et plus les\r\n     ungs que les autres; si en y ot aucuns qui s'avancerent et\r\n     bouterent en la presse trop avant; ear ilz y furent encloz\r\n     et estains, et par especial messire Loys de Cousant, ung\r\n     chevallier de Berry, et messire Fleton de Revel, filz au\r\n     seigneur de Revel; mais encoires en y eut des autres, dont\r\n     ce fut dommage: mais si grosse bataille, dont celle la fut,\r\n     ou tant avoit de pueple, ne se povoit parfurnir et au mieulx\r\n     venir pour les victoriens, que elle ne couste grandement.\r\n     Car jeunes chevalliers et escuiers qui desirent les armes se\r\n     avancent voulentiers pour leur honneur et pour acquerre\r\n     loenge; et la presse estoit la si grande et le dangier si\r\n     perilleux pour ceulx qui estoient enclos ou abatus, que se\r\n     on n'avoit trop bonne ayde, on ne se povoit relever. Par ce\r\n     party y eut des Francoiz mors et estains aucuns; mais plente\r\n     ne fut ce mie; ear quant il venoit a point, ilz aidoient\r\n     l'un l'autre. La eut ung molt grant nombre de Flamens occis,\r\n     dont les tas des mors estoient haulx et longs ou la bataille\r\n     avoit este; on ne vey jamais si peu de sang yssir a tant de\r\n     mors.\r\n\r\n     Quant les Flamens qui estoient derriere veirent que ceulx\r\n     devant fondoient et cheoient l'un sus l'autre et que ilz\r\n     estoient tous desconfis, ilz s'esbahirent et jetterent leurs\r\n     plancons par terre et leurs armures et se misrent a la\r\n     fuitte vers Courtray et ailleurs. Ilz n'avoient cure que\r\n     pour eulx mettre a sauvete. Et Franchois et Bretons apres,\r\n     quy les chassoient en fossez et en buissons, en aunois et an\r\n     mares et bruieres, cy dix, cy vingt, cy trente, et la les\r\n     recombatoient de rechief, et la les occioient, se ilz\r\n     n'estoient les plus fors. Si en y eut ung moult grant nombre\r\n     de mors en la chace entre le lieu de la bataille et\r\n     Courtray, ou ilz se retraioient a saulf garant. Ceste\r\n     bataille advint sur le Mont d'Or entre Courtray et Rosebeque\r\n     en l'an de grace nostre seigneur, mil iij'c. iiij'xx. et\r\n     II., le jeudi devant le samedi de l'advent, le xxvij'e.\r\n     jour de novembre, et estoit pour lors le roy Charles de\r\n     France ou xiiij'e. an de son eage.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[131] The chronicle of the pseudo-Turpin is of little real importance in\r\nthe history of French literature, because it is admitted to have been\r\nwritten in Latin. The busy idleness of critics has however prompted them\r\nto discuss at great length the question whether the _Chanson de Roland_\r\nmay not possibly have been composed from this chronicle. The facts are\r\nthese. Tilpin or Turpin was actually archbishop of Rheims from 753-794,\r\nbut nobody pretends that the chronicle going under his name is\r\nauthentic. All that is certain is that it is not later than 1165, and\r\nthat it is probably not earlier than the middle, or at most the\r\nbeginning, of the eleventh century, while the part of it which is more\r\nparticularly in question is of the end of that century. _Roland_ is\r\nalmost certainly of the middle at latest. Curiosity on this point may be\r\ngratified by consulting M. Gaston Paris, _De pseudo-Turpino_, Paris,\r\n1865, or M. Leon Gautier, _Epopees Francaises_, Paris, 1878. But, from\r\nthe literary point of view, it is sufficient to say that, while _Turpin_\r\nis of the very smallest literary merit, _Roland_ is among the capital\r\nworks of the middle ages.\r\n\r\n[132] Ed.

Froissart's poems give many\r\nbiographical details which are interesting, but unimportant. He wandered\r\nall his life from court to court, patronised and pensioned by kings,\r\nqueens, and princes. He was successively _cure_ of Lestines and canon of\r\nChimay. In early life he was much in England, being specially patronised\r\nby Edward III. and Philippa.\r\n\r\n[136] _Old Mortality_, chap. 35.\r\n\r\n[137] Ed. Buchon.

Accordingly we find\r\nthat, from the beginning of the thirteenth century, the amount of prose\r\nliterature is constantly on the increase. It happens, however, or, to\r\nspeak more precisely, it follows that this miscellaneous prose\r\nliterature is of much less importance and of much less interest than the\r\ncontemporary and kindred literature in verse. For in the nature of\r\nthings much of it was occupied with what may be called the journey-work\r\nof literature,--the stuff which, unless there be some special attraction\r\nin its form, grows obsolete, or retains a merely antiquarian interest in\r\nthe course of time. There was, moreover, still among the chief patrons\r\nof literature a preference for verse which diverted the brightest\r\nspirits to the practice of that form. Yet again, the best prose\r\ncomposition of the middle ages, with the exception of a few works of\r\nfiction, is to be found in its chronicles, and these have already been\r\nnoticed. A review, therefore, much less minute in scale than that which\r\nin the first ten chapters of this book has been given to the mediaeval\r\npoetry of France, will suffice for its mediaeval prose, and such a\r\nreview will appropriately close the survey of the literature of the\r\nmiddle ages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prose Sermons. St. Bernard.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maurice de Sully.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Later Preachers. Gerson.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out in the first chapter that documentary\r\nevidence exists to prove the custom of preaching in French (or at least\r\nin _lingua romana_) at a very early date. It is not, however, till many\r\ncenturies after the date of Mummolinus, that there is any trace of\r\nregularly written vernacular discourses. When these appear in the\r\ntwelfth century the Provencal dialects appear to have the start of\r\nFrench proper. Whether the forty-four prose sermons of St. Bernard which\r\nexist were written by him in French, or were written in Latin and\r\ntranslated, is a disputed point. The most reasonable opinion seems to be\r\nthat they were translated, but it is uncertain whether at the beginning\r\nof the thirteenth or the middle of the twelfth century. However this may\r\nbe, the question of written French sermons in the twelfth century does\r\nnot depend on that of St. Bernard's authorship. Maurice de Sully, who\r\npresided over the See of Paris from 1160 to 1195, has left a\r\nconsiderable number of sermons which exist in manuscripts of very\r\ndifferent dialects. Perhaps it may not be illegitimate to conclude from\r\nthis, that at the time such written sermons were not very common, and\r\nthat preachers of different districts were glad to borrow them for their\r\nown use. These also are thought to have been first written in Latin and\r\nthen translated. But whether Maurice de Sully was a pioneer or not, he\r\nwas very quickly followed by others. In the following century the number\r\nof preachers whose vernacular work has been preserved is very large; the\r\nincrease being, beyond all doubt, partially due to the foundation of the\r\ntwo great preaching orders of St. Francis and St. Dominic. The existing\r\nliterature of this class, dating from the thirteenth, the fourteenth,\r\nand the early fifteenth centuries, is enormous, but the remarks made at\r\nthe beginning of this chapter apply to it fully. Its interest is almost\r\nwholly antiquarian, and not in any sense literary. Distinguished names\r\nindeed occur in the catalogue of preachers, but, until we come to the\r\nextreme verge of the mediaeval period proper, hardly one of what may be\r\ncalled the first importance. The struggle between the Burgundian and\r\nOrleanist, or Armagnac parties, and the ecclesiastical squabbles of the\r\nGreat Schism, produced some figures of greater interest. Such are Jean\r\nPetit, a furious partisan, who went so far as to excuse the murder of\r\nthe Duke of Orleans, and Jean Charlier, or Gerson, one of the most\r\nrespectable and considerable names of the later mediaeval literature.\r\nGerson was born in 1363, at a village of the same name in Lorraine. He\r\nearly entered the College de Navarre, and distinguished himself under\r\nPeter d'Ailly, the most famous of the later nominalists. He became\r\nChancellor of the University, received a living in Flanders, and for\r\nmany years preached in the most constantly attended churches of Paris.\r\nHe represented the University at the Council of Constance, and, becoming\r\nobnoxious to the Burgundian party, sought refuge with one of his\r\nbrothers at Lyons, where he is said to have taught little children. He\r\ndied in 1429. Gerson, it should perhaps be added, is one of the numerous\r\ncandidates (but one of the least likely) for the honour of having\r\nwritten the _Imitation_. He concerns us here only as the author of\r\nnumerous French sermons. His work in this kind is very characteristic of\r\nthe time. Less mixed with burlesque than that of his immediate\r\nsuccessors, it is equally full of miscellaneous, and, as it now seems,\r\nsomewhat inappropriate erudition, and far fuller of the fatal\r\nallegorising and personification of abstract qualities which were in\r\nevery branch of literature the curse of the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies. Yet there are passages of real eloquence in Gerson, though\r\nperhaps the chief literary point about him is the evidence he gives of\r\nthe insufficiency of the language in its then condition for serious\r\nprose work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moral and Devotional Treatises.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Translators.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political and Polemical Works.]\r\n\r\nThis is indeed the lesson of most of the writing which we have to notice\r\nin this chapter. Next to sermons may most naturally be placed devotional\r\nand moral works, for, as may easily be imagined, theology and\r\nphilosophy, properly so called, did not condescend to the vulgar tongue\r\nuntil after the close of the period. Only treatises for the practical\r\nuse of the unlearned and ignorant adopted the vernacular. Of such there\r\nare manuals of devotion and sketches of sacred history which date from\r\nthe thirteenth century, besides numerous later treatises, among the\r\nauthors of which Gerson is again conspicuous. The most popular, perhaps,\r\nand in a way the most interesting of all such moral and devotional\r\ntreatises, is the book of the Chevalier de la Tour Landry[142], written\r\nin the third quarter of the fourteenth century. This book, destined for\r\nthe instruction of the author's three daughters, is composed of Bible\r\nstories, moral tales from ordinary literature and from the writer's\r\nexperience, precepts and rules of conduct, and so forth; in short, a\r\nWhole Duty of Girls. Most however of the works of this sort which were\r\ncurrent were, as may be supposed, not original, but translated, and\r\nthese translations played a very important part in the history of the\r\nlanguage. The earliest of all are translations of the Bible, especially\r\nof the Psalms and the book of Kings, the former of which may perhaps\r\ndate from the end of the eleventh century. Translations of the fathers,\r\nand of the Lives of the Saints, followed in such numbers that, in 1199,\r\nPope Innocent III. blamed their indiscriminate use. The translation of\r\nprofane literature hardly begins much before the thirteenth century. In\r\nthis it becomes frequent; and in the following many classical writers\r\nand more mediaeval authors in Latin underwent the process. But it was\r\nnot till the close of the fourteenth century that the most important\r\ntranslations were made, and that translation began to exercise its\r\nnatural influence on a comparatively unsophisticated language, by\r\nproviding terms of art, by generally enriching the vocabulary, and by\r\nthe elaboration of the peculiarities of syntax and style necessary for\r\nrendering the sentences of languages so highly organised as Latin and\r\nGreek. Under John of Valois and his three successors considerable\r\nencouragement was given by the kings of France to this sort of work, and\r\nthree translators, Pierre Bersuire, Nicholas Oresme, and Raoul de\r\nPresles, have left special reputations. The eldest of these, Pierre\r\nBersuire or Bercheure, a friend of Petrarch, was born in 1290, and\r\ntowards the end of his life, about 1352, translated part of Livy.\r\nNicholas Oresme, the date of whose birth is unknown, but who entered the\r\nCollege de Navarre in 1348, and is likely to have been at that time\r\nthirteen or fourteen years old, and who became Dean of Rouen and Bishop\r\nof Lisieux, translated, in 1370 and the following years, the _Ethics_,\r\n_Politics_, and _Economics_ of Aristotle (from the Latin, not the\r\nGreek). He died in 1382. Oresme was a good writer, and particularly\r\ndexterous in adopting neologisms necessary for his purpose. Raoul de\r\nPresles executed translations of the Bible and of St. Augustine's _De\r\nCivitate Dei_. All these writers furnished an enlarged vocabulary to\r\ntheir successors, the most remarkable of whom were the already mentioned\r\nChristine de Pisan and Alain Chartier. The latter is especially\r\nnoteworthy as a prose writer, and the comments already made on his style\r\nand influence as a poet apply here also. His _Quadriloge Invectif_ and\r\n_Curial_, both satirical or, at least, polemical works, are his chief\r\nproductions in this kind. Raoul de Presles also composed a polemical\r\nwork, dealing chiefly with the burning question of the papal and royal\r\npowers, under the title of _Songe du Verger_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Codes and Legal Treatises.]\r\n\r\nIt might seem unlikely at first sight that so highly technical a subject\r\nas law should furnish a considerable contingent to early vernacular\r\nliterature; but there are some works of this kind both of ancient date\r\nand of no small importance. England and Normandy furnish an important\r\ncontingent, the 'Laws of William the Conqueror' and the _Coutumiere\r\nNormandie_ being the most remarkable: but the most interesting document\r\nof this kind is perhaps the famous _Assises de Jerusalem_, arranged by\r\nGodfrey of Bouillon and his crusaders as the code of the kingdom of\r\nJerusalem in 1099, and known also as the _Lettres du Sepulcre_, from the\r\nplace of their custody. The original text was lost or destroyed at the\r\ncapture of Jerusalem by Saladin in 1187; but a new _Assise_, compiled\r\nfrom the oral tradition of the jurists who had seen and used the old,\r\nwas written by Philippe de Navarre in 1240, or thereabouts, for the use\r\nof the surviving Latin principalities of the East. This was shortly\r\nafterwards enlarged and developed by Jean d'Ibelin, a Syrian baron, who\r\ntook part in the crusade of St. Louis. These codes concerned themselves\r\nonly with one part of the original _Lettres du Sepulcre_, the laws\r\naffecting the privileged classes; but the other part, the _Assises des\r\nBourgeois_, survives in _Le Livre de la Cour des Bourgeois_, which has\r\nbeen thought to be older than the loss of the original. These various\r\nworks contain the most complete account of feudal jurisprudence in its\r\npalmy days that is known, for the still earlier Anglo-Norman laws\r\nrepresent a more mixed state of things. It was especially in Cyprus that\r\nthe Jerusalem codes were observed. The chief remaining works of the\r\nsame kind which deserve mention are the _Etablissements de St. Louis_\r\nand the _Livre de Justice et de Plet_, which both date from the time of\r\nLouis himself; the _Conseil_, a treatise on law by Pierre de Fontaines,\r\nwho died in 1289, and the _Coutumes du Beauvoisis_ of Philippe de\r\nBeaumanoir, who wrote in 1283. The legal literature of the fourteenth\r\ncentury is abundant, but possesses considerably less interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miscellanies and Didactic Works.]\r\n\r\nLast of all, before coming to prose fiction, a vast if not very\r\ninteresting class of miscellaneous prose work must be mentioned. The\r\nword class has been used, but perhaps improperly, for classification is\r\nalmost impossible. Books of accounts and domestic economy of all sorts\r\n(generally called _livres de raison_) were very common; treatises of all\r\nkinds of more general character on household management abounded. We\r\nhave a _Menagier de Paris_, a _Viandier de Paris_, both of the\r\nfourteenth century. But much earlier the orderly and symmetrical spirit\r\nwhich has always distinguished the French makes itself apparent in\r\nliterature. The _Livre des Metiers de Paris_ of Etienne Boileau, dating\r\nfrom the thirteenth century, gives a complete idea of the organisation\r\nof guilds and trades at that time. An innumerable multitude of treatises\r\non the minor morals, on love, on manners, exists in manuscript, and in\r\nrare instances in print. The _Tresors_, or compendious encyclopaedias,\r\nwhich have already been noticed in verse, began in the thirteenth\r\ncentury to be composed in prose, the most remarkable being that of\r\nBrunetto Latini, the master of Dante, who avowedly used French as his\r\nvehicle of composition, because it was the most commonly read of\r\nEuropean languages. This book was written apparently about or before\r\n1270. Nor did the separate arts lack illustration in prose. Medicine and\r\nalchemy, astronomy and poetry, war and chess, had their treatises, while\r\nBestiaries and Lapidaries are almost as numerous in prose as in verse.\r\nFinally, there is the important category of books of travel. There are a\r\ncertain number of voyages to the Holy Land[143]; some miscellaneous\r\ntravels mostly, though not universally, translated from the Latin; and\r\nlast, but not least, the great book of Marco Polo, which seems to have\r\nbeen written originally in French, the author, when in captivity at\r\nGenoa, having dictated it to Rusticien of Pisa, who also figures as a\r\ncompiler of late versions of the Arthurian legend, and who thus had some\r\nskill in French composition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fiction]\r\n\r\nThe prose fiction of the period has been kept to the last, because it\r\nexpresses a different order of literary endeavour from those divisions\r\nwhich have hitherto been treated. The language of the middle ages was\r\nill-suited for work other than narrative; for narrative work it was\r\nsupremely well adapted. Yet the prose fiction which we have is not on\r\nthe whole equal in merit to the poetry, though in one or two instances\r\nit is of great value. The medium of communication was not generally\r\nknown or used until the period of decadence had been reached, and the\r\npeculiar defects of mediaeval literature, prolixity and verbiage, show\r\nthemselves more conspicuously and more annoyingly in prose than in\r\nverse. We have, however, some remarkable work of the later periods, and\r\nin the latest of all we have one writer, Antoine de la Salle, who\r\ndeserves to rank with the great chroniclers as a fashioner of French\r\nprose.\r\n\r\nThe French prose fiction of the middle ages resolves itself into several\r\nclasses: the early Arthurian Romances already noticed; the scattered\r\ntales of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, which are chiefly to\r\nbe studied in two excellent volumes of the _Bibliotheque\r\nElzevirienne_[144]; the versions of such collections of legends, chiefly\r\noriental in origin, as the _History of the Seven Wise Men_ and the\r\n_Gesta Romanorum_; the longer classical romances in prose; the late\r\nprose _remaniements_ of the great verse epics and romances of the\r\ntwelfth century; and the more or less original work of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, when prose was becoming an independent and coequal literary\r\nexponent. The first class requires no further mention; of the third, the\r\neditions of the _Roman des Sept Sages_, by M. Gaston Paris[145], and of\r\nthe _Violier des Histoires Romaines_, by M. Gustave Brunet[146], may be\r\nreferred to as sufficient instances; of the fourth a very interesting\r\nspecimen has been made accessible by the publication of the prose _Roman\r\nde Jules Cesar_ of Jean de Tuim[147], a free version from Lucan made\r\napparently in the course of the thirteenth century, and afterwards\r\nimitated by the author of the verse romance; the fifth, though very\r\nnumerous, are not of much value, though the great romance of\r\n_Perceforest_ and a few others may be excepted from this general\r\ncondemnation. The second and the last deserve a longer mention.\r\n\r\nThe tales of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, as published by\r\nMM. Moland and Hericault, are eight in number. Those of the second\r\nvolume are on the whole inferior in interest to those of the first. They\r\nconsist of _Asseneth_, a graceful legend of the marriage of Joseph with\r\nthe daughter of the Egyptian high-priest; _Troilus_, interesting chiefly\r\nas a prose version of Benoist de Ste. More's legend of _Troilus and\r\nCressida_, through the channel of Guido Colonna and Boccaccio; and a\r\nvery curious English story, that of the rebel Fulk Fitzwarine. The\r\nthirteenth-century tales consist of _L'Empereur Constant_, the story\r\nwith which Mr. Morris has made English readers familiar under the title\r\nof the 'Man born to be King;' of a prose version of the ubiquitous\r\nlegend of _Amis et Amiles_; of _Le roi Flore et la belle Jehanne_, a\r\nkind of version of _Griselda_, though the particular trial and\r\nexhibition of fidelity is quite different; of the _Comtesse de\r\nPonthieu_, the least interesting of all; and lastly, of the finest prose\r\ntale of the French middle ages, _Aucassin et Nicolette_. In this\r\nexquisite story Aucassin, the son of the count of Beaucaire, falls in\r\nlove with Nicolette, a captive damsel. It is very short, and is written\r\nin mingled verse and prose. The theme is for the most part nothing but\r\nthe desperate love of Aucassin, which is careless of religion, which\r\nmakes him indifferent to the joy of battle and to everything, except\r\n'Nicolette ma tres-douce mie,' and which is, of course, at last\r\nrewarded. But the extreme beauty of the separate scenes makes it a\r\nmasterpiece.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antoine de la Salle.]\r\n\r\nAntoine de la Salle is one of the most fortunate of authors. The\r\ntendency of modern criticism is generally to endeavour to prove that\r\nsome famous author has been wrongly credited with some of the work which\r\nhas made his fame. Homer, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Rabelais, have all had\r\nto pay this penalty. In the case of Antoine de la Salle, on the\r\ncontrary, critics have vied with each other in heaping unacknowledged\r\nmasterpieces on his head. His only acknowledged work is the charming\r\nromance of _Petit Jean de Saintre_[148]. The first thing added to this\r\nhas been the admirable satire of the _Quinze Joyes du Mariage_[149], the\r\nnext the famous collection of the _Cent Nouvelles_[150], and the last\r\nthe still more famous farce of _Pathelin_[151]. There are for once few\r\nor no external reasons why these various attributions should not be\r\nadmitted, while there are many internal ones why they should. Antoine de\r\nla Salle was born in 1398, and spent his life in the employment of\r\ndifferent kings and princes;--Louis III of Anjou, King of Naples, his\r\nson the good King Rene, the count of Saint Pol, and Philip the Good of\r\nBurgundy, who was his natural sovereign. Nothing is known of him after\r\n1461. Of the three prose works which have been attributed to him--there\r\nare others of a didactic character in manuscript--the _Quinze Joyes du\r\nMariage_ is extremely brief, but it contains the quintessence of all the\r\nsatire on that honourable estate which the middle ages had elaborated.\r\nEvery chapter--there is one for each 'joy' with a prologue and\r\nconclusion--ends with a variation on this phrase descriptive of the\r\nunhappy Benedict, 'est sy est enclose dans la nasse, et a l'aventure ne\r\ns'en repent point et s'il n'y estait il se y mettroit bientot; la usera\r\nsa vue en languissant, et finira miserablement ses jours.' The satire is\r\nmuch quieter and of a more humorous and less boisterous character than\r\nwas usual at the time. The _Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles_ are to all intents\r\nand purposes prose _fabliaux_. They have the full licence of that class\r\nof composition, its sparkling fun, its truth to the conditions of\r\nordinary human life. Many of them are taken from the work of the Italian\r\nnovelists, but all are handled in a thoroughly original manner. In style\r\nthey are perhaps the best of all the late mediaeval prose works, being\r\nclear, precise, and definite without the least appearance of baldness or\r\ndryness. _Petit Jehan de Saintre_ is, together with the _Chronique de\r\nMessire Jacques de Lalaing_[152] of Georges Chastellain (a delightful\r\nbiography, which is not a work of fiction), the hand-book of the last\r\nage of chivalry. Jehan de Saintre, who was a real person of the\r\npreceding century, but from whom the novelist borrows little or nothing\r\nbut his name, falls in love with a lady who is known by the fantastic\r\ntitle of 'la dame des belles cousines.' He wins general favour by his\r\ncourtesy, true love, and prowess; but during his absence in quest of\r\nadventures, his faithless mistress betrays him for a rich abbot. The\r\nlatter part of this book exhibits something of the satiric intention,\r\nwhich was never long absent from the author's mind; the former contains\r\na picture, artificial perhaps, but singularly graceful, of the elaborate\r\nreligion, as it may almost be called, of chivalry. Strikingly evident in\r\nthe book is the surest of all signs of a dying stage of society, the\r\nmost delicate observation and sympathetic description joined to\r\nsarcastic and ironical criticism.\r\n\r\nAs examples of this prose literature we may take a fragment of one of\r\nthe sermons attributed to St. Bernard (twelfth century), an extract from\r\n_Aucassin et Nicolette_ (thirteenth century), and one from the _Curial_\r\nof Alain Chartier (early fifteenth century):--\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

The survey has extended,\r\ntaking the extremest chronological limits, over some eight centuries.\r\nBut, until the end of the eleventh, the monuments of ancient French\r\nliterature are few and scattered, and the actual manuscripts which we\r\npossess date in hardly any case further back than the twelfth. In\r\nreality the history of mediaeval literature in France is the history of\r\nthe productions of the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and early\r\nfifteenth centuries with a long but straggling introduction, ranging\r\nfrom the eighth or even the seventh. Its palmy time is unquestionably in\r\nthe twelfth and the thirteenth. During these two hundred years almost\r\nevery kind of literature is attempted. Vast numbers of epic poems are\r\nwritten; one great story, that of Arthur, exercises the imagination as\r\nhardly any other story has exercised it either in ancient or in modern\r\ntimes; the drama is begun in all its varieties of tragedy, comedy, and\r\nopera; lyric poetry finds abundant and exquisite expression; history\r\nbegins to be written, not indeed from the philosophic point of view, but\r\nwith vivid and picturesque presentment of fact; elaborate codes are\r\ndrawn; vernacular homilies, not mere rude colloquial discourses, are\r\ncomposed; the learning of the age, such as it is, finds popular\r\ntreatment; and in particular a satiric literature, more abundant and\r\nmore racy if less polished than any that classical antiquity has left\r\nus, is committed to writing. It is often wondered at and bewailed that\r\nthis vigorous growth was succeeded by a period of comparative stagnation\r\nin which little advance was made, and in which not a little decided\r\nfalling off is noticeable. Except the formal lyric poetry of the\r\nfourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, and the multiplied dramatic\r\nenergy of the latter, nothing novel or vigorous appears for some hundred\r\nand forty years, until the extreme verge of the period, when the\r\nsubstitution of the prose tale, as exemplified in the work attributed to\r\nAntoine de la Salle, for the verse Fabliau, opens a prospect which four\r\ncenturies of progress have not closed. The early perfection of Italian,\r\na language later to start than French, has been regretfully compared\r\nwith this, and the blame has been thrown on the imperfection of\r\nmediaeval arrangements for educating the people. The complaint is\r\nmistaken, and almost foolish. It is not necessary to look much further\r\nthan Italian itself to see the Nemesis of a too early development.\r\nFrench, like English, which had a yet tardier literary growth, has\r\npursued its course unhasting, unresting, to the present hour. Italian\r\nsince the close of the sixteenth century has contributed not a single\r\nmasterpiece to European literature, and not much that can be called good\r\nsecond-rate. It is not impossible that the political troubles of\r\nFrance--the Hundred Years' War especially--checked the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of the country, but if so, the check was in the long run\r\naltogether salutary. The middle ages were allowed to work themselves\r\nout--to produce their own natural fruit before the full influx of\r\nclassical literature. What is more, a breathing time was allowed after\r\nthe exhaustion of the first set of influences, before the second was\r\nfelt. Hence the French renaissance was a far more vigorous growth than\r\nthe renaissance of Italy, which displays at once the signs of precocity\r\nand of premature decay. But we are more immediately concerned at the\r\npresent moment with the literary results of the middle ages themselves.\r\nIt is only of late years that it has been possible fully to estimate\r\nthese, and it is now established beyond the possibility of doubt that to\r\nFrance almost every great literary style as distinguished from great\r\nindividual works is at this period due. The testimony of Brunetto Latini\r\nas to French being the common literary tongue of Europe in the\r\nthirteenth century has been quoted, and those who have read the\r\nforegoing chapters attentively will be able to recall innumerable\r\ninstances of the literary supremacy of France. It must of course be\r\nremembered that she enjoyed for a long time the advantage of enlisting\r\nin her service the best wits of Southern England, of the wide district\r\ndominated by the Provencal dialects, and of no small part of Germany and\r\nof Northern Italy. But these countries took far more than they gave: the\r\nChansons de Gestes were absorbed by Italy, the Arthurian Romances by\r\nGermany; the Fabliaux crossed the Alps to assume a prose dress in the\r\nSouthern tongue; the mysteries and miracles made their way to every\r\ncorner of Europe to be copied and developed. To the origination of the\r\nmost successful of all artificial forms of poetry--the sonnet--France\r\nhas indeed no claim, but this is almost a solitary instance. The three\r\nuniversally popular books (to use the word loosely) of profane\r\nliterature in the middle ages, the epic of Arthur, the satire of Reynard\r\nthe Fox, the allegorical romance of the Rose, are of French origin. In\r\nimportance as in bulk no literature of these four centuries could dare\r\nto vie with French.\r\n\r\nThis astonishing vigour of imaginative writing was however accompanied\r\nby a corresponding backwardness in the application of the vernacular to\r\nthe use of the exacter and more serious departments of letters. Before\r\nComines, the French chronicle was little more than gossip, though it was\r\noften the gossip of genius. No philosophical, theological, ethical, or\r\npolitical work deserving account was written in French prose before the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century. The very language remained utterly\r\nunfitted for any such use. Its vocabulary, though enormously rich in\r\nmere volume, was destitute of terms of the subtlety and precision\r\nnecessary for serious prose; its syntax was hardly equal to anything but\r\na certain loose and flowing narration, which, when turned into the\r\nchannel of argument, became either bald or prolix. The universal use of\r\nLatin for graver purposes had stunted and disabled it. At the same time\r\ngreat changes passed over the language itself. In the fourteenth century\r\nit lost with its inflections not a little of its picturesqueness, and\r\nhad as yet hit upon no means of supplying the want. The loose\r\northography of the middle ages had culminated in a fantastic redundance\r\nof consonants which was reproduced in the earliest printed books. This,\r\nas readers of Rabelais are aware, was an admirable assistance to\r\ngrotesque effect, but it was fatal to elegance or dignity except in the\r\nomnipotent hands of a master like Rabelais himself. In the fifteenth\r\ncentury, moreover, the stereotyped forms of poetry were losing their\r\nfreshness and grace while retaining their stately precision. The faculty\r\nof sustained verse narrative had fled the country, only to return at\r\nvery long intervals and in very few cases. The natural and almost\r\nchildish outspokenness of early times had brought about in all\r\ndepartments of comic literature a revolting coarseness of speech. The\r\nfarce and the prose tale almost outdo the more naif _fabliau_ in this.\r\nNothing like a critical spirit had yet manifested itself in matters\r\nliterary, unless the universal following of a few accepted models may be\r\ncalled criticism. The very motives of the mediaeval literature, its\r\nunquestioning faith, its sense of a narrow circle of knowledge\r\nsurrounded by a vast unknown, its acceptance of classes and orders in\r\nchurch and state (tempered as this acceptance had been by the sharpest\r\nsatire on particulars but by hardly any argument on general points),\r\nwere losing their force. Everything was ready for a renaissance, and the\r\nnext book will show how the Renaissance came and what it did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nTHE RENAISSANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nVILLON, COMINES, AND THE LATER FIFTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Middle Ages and the Renaissance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Characteristics of Fifteenth-century Literature.]\r\n\r\nTo determine at what period exactly mediaeval literature ceases in\r\nFrance and modern literature begins, is not one of the easiest problems\r\nof literary history. It has sometimes been solved by the obvious\r\nexpedient of making out of the fifteenth century a period of transition,\r\nsometimes by continuing the classification of 'mediaeval' until the time\r\nwhen Marot and Rabelais gave unmistakeable evidence of the presence and\r\nworking of the modern spirit. Perhaps, however, there may, after all,\r\nhave been something in the instinct which, in words clumsily enough\r\nchosen, made Boileau date modern French poetry from Villon[153], and\r\nthere can hardly be any doubt that, as far as spirit if not form goes,\r\nmodern French prose dates from Comines. These two contemporary authors,\r\nmoreover, have in them the characteristic which perhaps more than any\r\nother distinguishes modern from mediaeval literature, the predominance\r\nof the personal element. In their works, especially if Villon be taken\r\nwith the immediately preceding and partially contemporary Charles\r\nd'Orleans, a difference of the most striking kind is noticeable at once.\r\nIt is not that the prince who served the god Nonchaloir so piously is\r\ndeficient in personal characteristics or personal attractiveness, but\r\nthat his personality is still, so to speak, generic rather than\r\nindividual. He is still the Trouvere of the nobler class, dallying with\r\nhalf-imaginary woes in the forms consecrated by tradition to the record\r\nof them. Not so the vagabond whose words after four centuries appeal\r\ndirectly to the spirit of the modern reader. That reader is cut off from\r\nCharles d'Orleans' world by a gulf across which he can only project\r\nhimself by a great effort of study or of sympathetic determination. The\r\nbarriers which separate him from Villon are slight enough, consisting\r\nmostly of trifling changes in language and manners which a little\r\nexertion easily overcomes.\r\n\r\nThe latter portion of the fifteenth century, or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, its last two-thirds, have frequently been described as a\r\n'dead season' in French literature. The description is not wholly just.\r\nEven if, according to the plan just explained, we throw Charles\r\nd'Orleans and Antoine de la Salle, two names of great importance, back\r\ninto the mediaeval period, and if we allow most of the chroniclers who\r\npreceded Comines to accompany them, there are still left, before the\r\nreign of Francis the First witnessed the definite blooming of the\r\nRenaissance in France, the two names of consummate importance which\r\nstand at the head of this chapter, a few minor writers of interest such\r\nas Coquillart, Baude, Martial d'Auvergne, an interesting group of\r\nliterary or at least oratorical ecclesiastics, and a much larger and,\r\nfrom a literary point of view, more important group of elaborate\r\nversifiers, the so-called _grands rhetoriqueurs_ who preceded the\r\nPleiade in endeavouring to Latinise the French tongue, and whose stiff\r\nverse produced by a natural rebound the easy grace of Clement Marot.\r\nEach of these persons and groups will demand some notice, and the\r\nmention of them will bring us to the Renaissance of which the subjects\r\nof this chapter were the forerunners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Villon.]\r\n\r\nFrancois Villon[154], or Corbueil, or Corbier, or de Montcorbier, or des\r\nLoges, was certainly born at Paris in the year 1431. Of the date of his\r\ndeath nothing certain is known, some authorities extending his life\r\ntowards the close of the century in order to adjust Rabelais' anecdotes\r\nof him[155], others supposing him to have died before the publication of\r\nthe first edition of his works in 1489. That Villon was not his\r\npatronymic, whichsoever of his numerous aliases may really deserve that\r\ndistinction, is certain. He was a citizen of Paris and a member of the\r\nuniversity, having the status of _clerc_. But his youth was occupied in\r\nother matters than study. In 1455 he killed, apparently in self-defence,\r\na priest named Philip Sermaise, fled from Paris, was condemned to\r\nbanishment in default of appearance, and six months afterwards received\r\nletters of pardon. In 1456 a faithless mistress, Catherine de\r\nVausselles, drew him into a second affray, in which he had the worst,\r\nand again he fled from Paris. During his absence a burglary committed in\r\nthe capital put the police on the track of a gang of young\r\ngood-for-nothings among whom Villon's name figured, and he was arrested,\r\ntried, tortured, and condemned to death. On appeal, however, the\r\nsentence was commuted to banishment. Four years after he was in prison\r\nat Meung, consigned thither by the Bishop of Orleans, but the king,\r\nLouis the Eleventh, set him free. Thenceforward nothing certain is known\r\nof him. He had at one time relations with Charles d'Orleans. Such are\r\nthe bare facts of his singular life, to which the peculiar character of\r\nhis work has directed perhaps disproportionate attention. This work\r\nconsists of a poem in forty stanzas of eight octosyllabic lines (each\r\nrhymed a, b, a, b, b, c, b, c) called the _Petit Testament_[156]; of a\r\npoem in 173 similar stanzas called the _Grand Testament_, in which about\r\na score of minor pieces, chiefly ballades or rondeaux, are inserted; of\r\na _Codicil_ composed mainly of ballades; of a few separate pieces, and\r\nof some ballades in _argot_, collectively called _Le Jargon_. Besides\r\nthese there are doubtful pieces, including a curious work called _Les\r\nRepues Franches_, which describes in octaves like those of the\r\nTestaments the swindling tricks of Villon and his companions, an\r\nexcellent Dialogue between two characters, the Seigneurs de Mallepaye\r\nand Baillevent, and a still better Monologue entitled _Le Franc Archier\r\nde Bagnolet_. The Little Testament was written after the affair with\r\nCatherine de Vausselles, the Great Testament after his liberation from\r\nthe Bishop's Prison at Meung. Many of the minor poems contain allusions\r\nwhich enable us to fix them to various events in the poet's life. The\r\nfirst edition of his works was, as has been said, published in 1489. In\r\n1533 he had the honour of having Marot for editor, and up to the date of\r\nthe Bibliophile Jacob's edition of 1854 (since when there have been\r\nseveral editions), the number had reached thirty-two.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of Villon may be looked at either technically or\r\nfrom the point of view of the matter of his work. He had an\r\nextraordinary mastery of the most artificial forms of poetry which have\r\never been employed. The rondel, which Charles d'Orleans wrote with so\r\nmuch grace, he did not use, but his rondeaux are generally exquisite.\r\nThe ballade, however, was his special province. No writer has ever got\r\nthe full virtue out of the recurrent rhymes and refrains, which are the\r\nspecial characteristics of the form, as Villon has. No one has infused\r\ninto a mere string of names, such as his famous _Ballade des Dames du\r\nTemps Jadis_ and others, such exquisitely poetical effects by dint of an\r\nepithet here and there and of a touching burden. But the matter of his\r\nverse is in many ways perfectly on a level with its manner. No one\r\nexcels him in startling directness of phrase, in simple but infinite\r\npathos of expression. Of the former, the sudden cry of the Belle\r\nHeaulmiere after the recital of her former triumphs--\r\n\r\n    Que m'en reste-t-il? honte et peche;\r\n\r\nand the despairing conclusion of the lover of La Grosse Margot--\r\n\r\n    Je suis paillard, paillardise me suit--\r\n\r\nare examples in point; of the latter the line in the rondeau to Death--\r\n\r\n    Deux etions et n'avions qu'un coeur.\r\n\r\nNo one has bolder strokes of the picturesque, as for instance--\r\n\r\n              De Constantinoble\r\n    L'emperier aux poings dores;\r\n\r\nand no one can render the sombre horror of a scene better than Villon\r\nhas rendered it in the famous epitaph of the gibbeted corpses--\r\n\r\n    La pluie nous a debues et laves,\r\n      Et le soleil desseches et noircis,\r\n    Pies, corbeaulx nous out les yeux caves\r\n      Et arraches la barbe et les sourcils.\r\n\r\nThese are some of Villon's strongest points. Yet in his comparatively\r\nlimited work--limited in point of bulk and peculiar in style and\r\nsubject--he has contrived to show perhaps more general poetical power\r\nthan any other writer who has left so small a total of verse. The note\r\nof his song is always true and always sweet; and despite the intensely\r\nallusive character of most of it, and the necessary loss of the key to\r\nmany of the allusions, it has in consequence continued popular through\r\nall changes of language and manners. Of very few French poets can it be\r\nsaid as of Villon that their charm is immediate and universal, and the\r\nreason of this is that his work is full of touches of nature which are\r\nuniversally perceived, as well as distinguished by consummate art of\r\nexpression. In the great literature which we are discussing, the latter\r\ncharacteristic is almost universally present, the former not so\r\nconstantly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comines.]\r\n\r\nThe literary excellence of Comines[157] is of a very different kind from\r\nthat of Villon, but he represents the changed attitude of the modern\r\nspirit towards practical affairs almost as strongly as Villon does the\r\nchange in its relations to art and sentiment. Philippe de Comines was\r\nborn, not at the chateau of the same name which was then in the\r\npossession of his uncle, but at Renescure, not very far from Hazebrouck.\r\nHis family name was Vandenclyte, and his ancestors (Flemings, as their\r\nname implies) had been citizens of Ghent before they acquired seignorial\r\nposition and rank. The education of Comines was neglected (he never\r\npossessed any knowledge of Latin), and his heritage was heavily\r\nencumbered. He was born before 1447, and entered the service of Philip\r\nof Burgundy and of his son Charles of Charolais, the future Charles le\r\nTemeraire. Comines was present at Montlhery and at the siege of Liege,\r\nwhile he played a considerable part in the celebrated affair of\r\nPeronne, when Louis XI. was in such danger. Before 1471 he had been\r\ncharged with several important negotiations by Charles, now duke, in\r\nFrance, England, and Spain. But, either personally disobliged by\r\nCharles, or, as seems most likely from the Memoirs, presaging with the\r\nkeen, unscrupulous intelligence of the time the downfall of the headlong\r\nprince, he quitted Burgundy and its master in 1472 and entered the\r\nservice of Louis, from whom he had already accepted a pension. He was\r\nrichly rewarded, married an heiress in Poitou, and at one time enjoyed\r\nthe forfeited fief of Talmont, a domain of the first importance, which\r\nhe afterwards had to restore to its rightful owners, the La Tremouilles.\r\nThe accession of Charles VIII. was not favourable to him, and, having\r\ntaken part against the Lady of Beaujeu, he was imprisoned and deprived\r\nof Talmont. But with his usual sagacity, he had in the Duke of Orleans,\r\nafterwards Louis XII., chosen the representative of the side destined to\r\nwin in the long run. The Italian wars gave scope to his powers. He was\r\nsent to Venice, was present at the battle of Fornovo, and met\r\nMachiavelli at Florence. In the reign of Louis XII. he received new\r\nplaces and pensions, and he died in 1511 aged at least sixty-four.\r\n\r\nComines is not a master of style, though at times the weight of his\r\nthought and the simplicity of his expression combine to produce an\r\neffect not unhappy. He has odd peculiarities of diction, especially\r\ninversions of phrase and sudden apostrophes which enliven an otherwise\r\nrather awkward manner of writing. Thus, in describing the bad education\r\nof the young nobles of his time, he says, 'de nulles lettres ils n'ont\r\nconnaissance. Un seul sage homme on ne leur met a l'entour.' And in his\r\naccount of the operations before the battle of Morat he says, 'Il (the\r\nDuke of Burgundy) sejourna a Losanne en Savoie ou vous monseigneur de\r\nVienne le servites d'un bon conseil en une grande maladie qu'il eut de\r\ndouleur et de tristesse.' On the whole, however, no one would think of\r\nreading Comines for the merit, or even the quaintness of his style, nor\r\ncan he be commended as a vivid, even if an inelegant describer. The\r\ngallant shows which excited the imaginations of his predecessors, the\r\nmediaeval chroniclers from Villehardouin to Froissart, find in him a\r\nclumsy annalist and a not too careful observer. His interest is\r\nconcentrated exclusively on the turns of fortune, the successes of\r\nstatecraft, and the lessons of conduct to be noticed in or extracted\r\nfrom the business in hand. With this purpose he is perpetually\r\ndigressing. The affairs of one country remind him of something that has\r\nhappened in another, and he stops to give an account of this. To a\r\ncertain extent the mediaeval influence is still strong on Comines,\r\nthough it shows itself in connection with evidences of the modern\r\nspirit. He is religious to a degree which might be called ostentatious\r\nif it were not pretty evidently sincere; and this religiosity is shown\r\nside by side with the exhibition of a typically unscrupulous and\r\nnon-moral, if not positively immoral, statecraft. Again, his reflexions,\r\nthough usually lacking neither in acuteness nor in depth, are often\r\nappended to a commonplace on the mutability of fortune, the error of\r\nanger, the necessity of adapting means to ends, and so forth. Everywhere\r\nin Comines is evident, however, the anti-feudal and therefore\r\nanti-mediaeval conception of a centralised government instead of a loose\r\nassemblage of powerful vassals. The favourite mediaeval ideal, of which\r\nSaint Simon was perhaps the last sincere champion, finds no defence in\r\nComines; and it seems only just to allow him, in his desertion of the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, some credit for drawing from the anarchy of the Bien\r\nPublic, and from his observations of Germany, England, and Spain, the\r\nconclusion that France must be united, and that union was only possible\r\nfor her under a king unhampered by largely appanaged and only nominally\r\ndependent princes. It should be said that the Memoires of Comines are\r\nnot a continuous history. The first six books deal with the reign of\r\nLouis XI. from 1465 to 1483. But the seventh is busied with Charles the\r\nEighth's Italian wars only, the author having passed over the period of\r\nhis own disgrace. Besides the Memoirs we possess a collection of\r\n_Lettres et Negotiations_.[158]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coquillart.]\r\n\r\nThere are three persons who, while of very much less importance than\r\nthose just introduced to the reader, deserve a mention in passing as\r\ncharacteristic and at the same time meritorious writers, during the\r\nsecond and third quarters of the fifteenth century, the extreme verge of\r\nwhich the life of all three appears to have touched. These are\r\nGuillaume Coquillart, Henri Baude, and Martial d'Auvergne. All three\r\nwere poets, all three have been somewhat over-praised by the scholars\r\nwho in days more or less recent have drawn them from their obscurity,\r\nbut all three made creditable head against what was mistaken and absurd\r\nin the literary fashions of the time. In the writings of all of them\r\nmoreover there is to be found something, if not much, which is\r\npositively good, and which deserves the attention, hardly perhaps of the\r\ngeneral reader, but of students of literature. Coquillart[159] was a\r\nnative, and for great part of his life an inhabitant, of Rheims. The\r\nextreme dates given for his birth and death are 1421 and 1510, but there\r\nis in reality, as is usual in the case of all men of letters before the\r\nsixteenth century, very little solid authority for his biography. It may\r\nbe mentioned that Marot declares him to have cut short his life by\r\ngaming. A life can hardly be said to be cut short at ninety, nor is that\r\nan age at which gaming is a frequent ruling passion. All that can be\r\nsaid is that he was certainly, as we should now say, in the civil\r\nservice of the province of Champagne during the reign of Louis XI., that\r\nlike many other men of the time he united ecclesiastical with legal\r\nfunctions, being not only a town-councillor but a canon, and that he has\r\nleft satirical works of some merit and importance. These last alone\r\nconcern us much. His chief production is a poem entitled _Les Droits\r\nNouveaux_, in octosyllabic verses, not arranged in stanzas of definite\r\nlength, but, on the other hand, interlacing the rhymes, and not in\r\ncouplets after the older fashion. The plan of this poem is by no means\r\neasy to describe. It is partly a social satire, partly a professional\r\nlampoon on the current methods of learning and teaching law, partly a\r\npolitical diatribe on the alterations introduced into provincial and\r\nnational life and polity under Louis XI. Not very different in character\r\nand exactly similar in form, except that it is arranged as the age would\r\nhave said _par personnages_, that is to say semi-dramatically, is the\r\n_Plaidoyer de la Simple et de la Rusee_. The _Blason des Armes et des\r\nDames_ takes up a mediaeval theme in a mediaeval style. The _procureurs_\r\n(advocates) of arms and of ladies endeavour to show each that his\r\nclient--war or love--deserves the chief attention of a prince. Here, as\r\nelsewhere with Coquillart, though of course more covertly, satire\r\ndominates. But the best of the pieces attributed to Coquillart are his\r\nmonologues. There are three of these, the _Monologue Coquillart_, the\r\n_Monologue du Puys_, and the _Monologue du Gendarme Casse_. This last is\r\na ferocious satire on its subject, coarse in language, like most of the\r\nauthor's poems, but full of rude vigour. The professional soldier as\r\ndistinguished from the feudal militia or the train-bands of the towns\r\nwas odious to the later middle ages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Baude.]\r\n\r\nHenri Baude[160] is a still less substantial figure. He seems to have\r\nbeen an _elu_ (member of a provincial board) for the province of\r\nLimousin, but to have lived mostly at Paris. He was born at Moulins\r\ntowards the beginning of the second quarter of the century, and formed\r\npart of the poetical circle of Charles d'Orleans in his old age. He had\r\ntroubles with lawless seigneurs and with the police of Paris; he finally\r\nsucceeded in obtaining the protection of the Duke of Bourbon, and he did\r\nnot die till the end of the century. Only a selection from his poems has\r\nyet been published. The chief thing remarkable about them (they are\r\nmostly occasional and of no great length) is the plainness, the\r\ndirectness, and, in not a few cases, the elegance of the diction, which\r\ndiffers remarkably from the cumbrous phrases and obscure allusive\r\nconceits of the time. Many of them are personal appeals for protection\r\nand assistance, others are satirical. Baude had a peculiar mastery of\r\nthe rondeau form. His rondeau to the king, expressing a sentiment often\r\nuttered by lackpenny bards in the days of patrons, is a good example of\r\nhis style, though it is hardly as simple and devoid of obscurity as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Martial d'Auvergne.]\r\n\r\nMartial d'Auvergne[161], or Martial de Paris (for by an odd chance both\r\nof these local surnames are given him, probably from the fact that, like\r\nBaude, he was a native of the centre of France and spent his life in\r\nthe capital), like Coquillart and Baude, was something of a lawyer by\r\nprofession, and has left work in prose as well as in verse. He certainly\r\ndied in 1508, and, as he is spoken of as _senio confectus_, he cannot\r\nhave been born much later than 1420, especially as his poem, the\r\n_Vigilles de Charles VII._, was written on the death of that prince in\r\n1461. This poem is of considerable extent, and is divided into nine\r\n'Psalms' and nine 'Lessons.' The staple metre is the quatrain, but\r\ndetached pieces in other measures occur. A complete history of the\r\nsubject is given, and in some of the digressions there are charming\r\npassages, notably one (given by M. de Montaiglon) on the country life.\r\nAnother very beautiful poem, commonly attributed to Martial, is entitled\r\n_L'Amant rendu Cordelier au service de l'Amour_, a piece of amorous\r\nallegory at once characteristic of the later middle ages, and free from\r\nthe faults usually found in such work. A prose work of a somewhat\r\nsimilar kind, entitled _Arrets d'Amour_, is known to be Martial's. In no\r\nwriter is there to be found more of the better part of Marot, as in the\r\nlight skipping verses:--\r\n\r\n    Mieux vault la liesse,\r\n    L'accueil et l'addresse,\r\n    L'amour et simplesse,\r\n        De bergers pasteurs,\r\n    Qu'avoir a largesse\r\n    Or, argent, richesse,\r\n    Ne la gentillesse\r\n        De ces grants seigneurs.\r\n\r\n    Car ils ont douleurs\r\n    Et des maulx greigneurs,\r\n    Mais pour nos labeurs\r\n        Nous avons sans cesse\r\n    Les beaulx pres et fleurs,\r\n    Fruitages, odeurs\r\n    Et joye a nos coeurs\r\n        Sans mal qui nous blesse.\r\n\r\nThere is something of the old _pastourelles_ in this, and of a note of\r\nsimplicity which French poetry had long lost.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rhetoriqueurs.]\r\n\r\nSuch verse as this of Martial d'Auvergne was, indeed, the exception at\r\nthe time. The staple poetry of the age was that of the _grands\r\nrhetoriqueurs_, as it has become usual to call them, apparently from a\r\nphrase of Coquillart's. Georges Chastellain[162] was the great master of\r\nthis school. But to him personally some injustice has been done. His\r\npupils and successors, however, for the most part deserve the ill repute\r\nin which they are held. This school of poetry had three principal\r\ncharacteristics. It affected the most artificial forms of the artificial\r\npoetry which the fourteenth century had seen established, the most\r\ncomplicated modulations of rhyme, such as the repetition, twice or even\r\nthrice at the end of a line, of the same sound in a different sense, and\r\nall the other puerilities of this particular Ars Poetica. Secondly, it\r\npursued to the very utmost the tradition of allegorising, of which the\r\n_Roman de la Rose_ had established the popularity. Thirdly, it followed\r\nthe example set by Chartier and his contemporaries of loading the\r\nlanguage as much as possible with Latinisms, and in a less degree,\r\nbecause Greek was then but indirectly known, Graecisms. These three\r\nthings taken together produced some of the most intolerable poetry ever\r\nwritten. The school had, indeed, much vitality in it, and overlapped the\r\nbeginnings of the Renaissance in such a manner that it will be necessary\r\nto take note of it again in the next chapter. Some, however, of its\r\ngreatest lights belonged to the present period. Such were Robertet, a\r\nheavy versifier and the author of letters not easily to be excelled in\r\npedantic coxcombry, who enjoyed much patronage, royal and other;\r\nMolinet, a direct disciple of Chastellain, and, like him, of the\r\nBurgundian party; and Meschinot (died 1509), a Breton, who has left us\r\nan allegorical work on the 'Spectacles of Princes,' and poems which can\r\nbe read in thirty different ways, any word being as good to begin with\r\nas any other. Such also was the father of a better poet than himself,\r\nOctavien de Saint Gelais (1466-1502), who died young and worn out by\r\ndebauchery. Jean Marot, the father of Clement, was a not inconsiderable\r\nmaster of the ballade, and has left poems which do not show to great\r\ndisadvantage by the side of those of his accomplished son. But the\r\nleader of the whole was Guillaume Cretin (birth and death dates\r\nuncertain), whom his contemporaries extolled in the most extravagant\r\nfashion, and whom a single satirical stroke of Rabelais has made a\r\nlaughing-stock for some three hundred and fifty years. The rondeau\r\nascribed to Raminagrobis, the 'vieux poete francais' of\r\n_Pantagruel_[163], is Cretin's, and the name and character have stuck.\r\nCretin was not worse than his fellows; but when even such a man as Marot\r\ncould call him a _poete souverain_, Rabelais no doubt felt it time to\r\nprotest in his own way. Marot himself, it is to be observed, confines\r\nhimself chiefly to citing Cretin's _vers equivoques_, which of their\r\nkind, and if we could do otherwise than pronounce that kind hopelessly\r\nbad, are without doubt ingenious. His poems are chiefly occasional\r\nverse, letters, _debats_, etc., besides ballades and rondeaux of all\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chansons du XV'eme Siecle.]\r\n\r\nOne charming book which has been preserved to us gives a pleasant\r\ncontrast to the formal poetry of the time. The _Chansons du XV'eme\r\nSiecle_, which M. Gaston Paris has published for the Old French Text\r\nSociety[164], exhibit informal and popular poetry in its most agreeable\r\naspect. They are one hundred and forty-three in number, some of them no\r\ndoubt much older than the fifteenth century, but certainly none of them\r\nyounger. There are _pastourelles_, war-songs, love-songs in great\r\nnumber, a few patriotic ditties, and a few which may be called pure\r\nfolksongs, with the story half lost and only a musical tangle of words\r\nremaining. Nothing can be more natural and simple than most of these\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preachers.]\r\n\r\nFew of the miscellaneous branches of literature at this time deserve\r\nnotice. But there was a group of preachers who have received attention,\r\nwhich is said by students of the whole subject of the mediaeval pulpit\r\nin France to be disproportionate, but which they owe perhaps not least\r\nto the citations of them in a celebrated and amusing book of the next\r\nage, the _Apologie pour Herodote_ of Henri Estienne. These are Menot\r\n(1440-1518) and Maillard the Franciscans, and Raulin (1443-1514), a\r\ndoctor of the Sorbonne. These preachers, living at a time which was not\r\none of popular sovereignty, did not meddle with politics as preachers\r\nhad done in France before and were to do again. But they carried into\r\nthe pulpit the habit of satirical denunciation in social as well as in\r\npurely religious matters, and gave free vent to their zeal. No\r\nillustrations of the singular licence which the middle ages permitted on\r\nsuch occasions are more curious than these sermons. Not merely did the\r\npreachers attack their audience for their faults in the most outspoken\r\nmanner, but they interspersed their discourses (as indeed was the\r\ninvariable custom throughout the whole middle ages) with stories of all\r\nkinds. In Raulin, the gravest of the three, occurs the famous history of\r\nthe church bells, which reappears in Rabelais, _a propos_ of the\r\nmarriage of Panurge.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[153]\r\n\r\n    Villon sut le premier, dans ces siecles grossiers,\r\n    Debrouiller l'art confus de nos vieux romanciers.\r\n\r\n    _Art Poet._ Ch. 1.\r\n\r\n[154] Ed.

In those times the influence of reforms of any kind\r\nfiltered slowly through the dense crust of custom which covered the\r\nnational life of each people, and there is nothing surprising in the\r\nfact that while Italy felt the full influence of the influx of classical\r\nculture in the fifteenth century, that influence should be only\r\npartially manifest in France during the first quarter of the sixteenth,\r\nwhile it was not until the century was more than half over that it\r\nshowed itself in England. The complete manifestation of the combined\r\ntendencies of mediaeval and neo-pagan thought was only displayed in\r\nShakespeare, but by that time, as is the wont of all such things, it had\r\nalready manifested itself partially, though in each part more fully and\r\ncharacteristically, elsewhere. It is in the literature of France that we\r\nfind the most complete exposition of these partial developments. Marot,\r\nRonsard, Rabelais, Calvin, Garnier, Montaigne, will not altogether make\r\nup a Shakespeare, yet of the various ingredients which go to make up the\r\ngreatest of literary productions each of them had shown, before\r\nShakespeare began to write, some complete and remarkable embodiment. It\r\nis this fact which gives the French literature of the sixteenth century\r\nits especial interest. Italy had almost ceased to be animated by the\r\ngenius of the middle ages before her literature became in any way\r\nperfect in form, and the survival of the classical spirit was so strong\r\nthere that mediaeval influence was never very potent in the moulding of\r\nthe national letters. England had lost the mediaeval differentia, owing\r\nto religious and political causes, before the Renaissance made its way\r\nto her shores. But in France the two currents met, though the earlier\r\nhad lost most of its force, and, according to the time-honoured\r\nparallel, flowed on long together before they coalesced. In the\r\nfollowing chapters we shall trace the history of this process, and here\r\nwe shall trace the first stage of it in reference to French poetry. In\r\nthe period of which Marot is the representative name, the earlier force\r\nwas still dominant in externals; in that of which Ronsard is the\r\nexponent, the Greek and Latin element shows itself as, for the moment,\r\nall-powerful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jean le Maire.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jehan du Pontalais.]\r\n\r\nBetween the _rhetoriqueurs_ proper, the Chastellains and the Cretins and\r\nthe Molinets on the one hand, and Marot and his contemporaries and\r\ndisciples on the other, a school of poets, considerable at least in\r\nnumbers, intervened. The chief of these was Jean le Maire des\r\nBelges[165]. He was the nephew of Molinet, and his birth at Belges or\r\nBavia in Hainault, as well as his literary ancestry and predilections,\r\ninclined him to the Burgundian, or, as it was now, the Austrian side.\r\nBut the strong national feeling which was now beginning to distinguish\r\nFrench-speaking men threw him on the side of the King of Paris, and he\r\nwas chiefly occupied in his serious literary work on tasks which were\r\nwholly French. His _Illustrations des Gaules_ is his principal prose\r\nwork, and in this he displays a remarkable faculty of writing prose at\r\nonce picturesque and correct. The titles of his other works (_Temple\r\nd'Honneur et de Vertu_, etc.) still recall the fifteenth century, and\r\nthe Latinising tradition of Chartier appears strong in him. But at the\r\nsame time he Latinises with a due regard to the genius of the language,\r\nand his work, pedantic and conceited as it frequently is, stands in\r\nsingular contrast to the work of some of his models. Something not\r\ndissimilar, though in this case the _rhetoriqueur_ influence is less\r\napparent, may be said of Pierre Gringore, whose true title to a place in\r\na history of French literature is, however, derived from his dramatic\r\nwork, and who will accordingly be mentioned later. Nor had the tradition\r\nof Villon, overlaid though it was by the abundance and popularity of\r\nformal and allegorising poetry, died out in France. At least two\r\nremarkable figures, Jehan du Pontalais and Roger de Collerye, represent\r\nit in the first quarter of the century. The former indeed[166] owes his\r\nplace here rather to a theory than to certain information; for if M.\r\nd'Hericault's notion that Jehan du Pontalais is the author of a work\r\nentitled _Contreditz du Songecreux_ be without foundation, Jehan falls\r\nback into the number of half mythical Bohemians, bilkers of tavern bills\r\nand successful out-witters of the officers of justice, who possess a\r\nshadowy personality in the literary history of France. _Les Contreditz\r\ndu Songecreux_ ranks among the most remarkable examples of the liberty\r\nwhich was accorded to the press under the reign of Louis XII., a king\r\nwho inherited some affection for literature from his father, Charles\r\nd'Orleans, and a keen perception of the importance of literary\r\nco-operation in political work from his ancestor, Philippe le Bel, and\r\nhis cousin Louis XI. In precision and strikingness of expression Jehan\r\nrecalls Villon; in the boldness of his satire on the great and the\r\nbitterness of his attacks on the character of women he recalls Antoine\r\nde la Salle and Coquillart. A trait illustrating the former power may be\r\nfound in the line descriptive of the hen-pecked man's condition--\r\n\r\n    Tous ses cinq sens lui fault retraire.\r\n\r\nwhile his attacks on the nobility are almost up to the level of Burns--\r\n\r\n    Noblesse enrichie Richesse ennoblie Tiennent leurs estatz,\r\n    Qui n'a noble vie Je vous certifie Noble n'est pas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roger de Collerye.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Predecessors of Marot.]\r\n\r\nRoger de Collerye[167] was a Burgundian, living at the famous and vinous\r\ntown of Auxerre, and he has celebrated his loves, his distress, his\r\namiable tendency to conviviality, in many rondeaux and other poems,\r\nsometimes attaining a very high level of excellence. 'Je suis\r\nBon-temps, vous le voyez' is the second line of one of his irregular\r\nballades, and the nickname expresses his general attitude well enough.\r\nMediaeval legacies of allegory, however, supply him with more unpleasant\r\npersonages, Faute d'Argent and Plate-Bourse, for his song, and his\r\nmistress, Gilleberte de Beaurepaire, appears to have been anything but\r\ncontinuously kind. Collerye has less perhaps of the _rhetoriqueur_\r\nflavour than any poet of this time before Marot, and his verse is very\r\nfrequently remarkable for directness and grace of diction. But like most\r\nverse of the kind it frequently drops into a conventionality less\r\nwearisome but not much less definite than that of the mere allegorisers.\r\nJehan Bouchet[168], a lawyer of Poitiers (not to be confounded with\r\nGuillaume Bouchet, author of the _Serees_), imitated the _rhetoriqueurs_\r\nfor the most part in form, and surpassed them in length, excelling\r\nindeed in this respect even the long-winded and long-lived poets of the\r\nclose of the fourteenth century. Bouchet is said to have composed a\r\nhundred thousand verses, and even M. d'Hericault avers that he read\r\ntwo-thirds of the number without discovering more than six quotable\r\nlines. Such works of Bouchet as we have examined fully confirm the\r\nstatement. Still, he was an authority in his way, and had something of a\r\nreputation. His fanciful _nom de plume_ 'Le Traverseur des Voies\r\nPerilleuses' is the most picturesque thing he produced, and is not\r\nuncharacteristic of the later middle age tradition. Rabelais himself,\r\nwho was a fair critic of poetry when his friends were not concerned, but\r\nwho was no poet, and was even strikingly deficient in some of the\r\ncharacteristics of the poet, admired and emulated Bouchet in heavy\r\nverse; and a numerously attended school, hardly any of the pupils being\r\nworth individual mention, gathered round the lawyer. Charles de Bordigne\r\nis only remarkable for having, in his _Legende de Pierre Faifeu_, united\r\nthe _rhetoriqueur_ style with a kind of Villonesque or rather\r\npseudo-Villonesque subject. The title of the chief poems of Symphorien\r\nChampier, _Le Nef des Dames Amoureuses_, sufficiently indicates his\r\nstyle. But Champier, though by no means a good poet, was a useful and\r\nstudious man of letters, and did much to form the literary _cenacle_\r\nwhich gathered at Lyons in the second quarter of the century, and which,\r\nboth in original composition, in translations of the classics, and in\r\nscholarly publication of work both ancient and modern, rendered\r\ninvaluable service to literature. Gratien du Pont[169] continued the now\r\nvery stale mediaeval calumnies on women in his _Controverses des Sexes\r\nMasculin et Feminin_. Eloy d'Amerval, a Picard priest, also fell into\r\nmediaeval lines in his _Livre de la Deablerie_, in which the personages\r\nof Lucifer and Satan are made the mouthpieces of much social satire.\r\nJean Parmentier, a sailor and a poet, combined his two professions in\r\n_Les Merveilles de Dieu_, a poem including some powerful verse. A\r\nvigorous ballade, with the refrain _Car France est Cymetiereaux\r\nAnglois_, has preserved the name of Pierre Vachot. But the remaining\r\npoets of this time could only find a place in a very extended literary\r\nhistory. Most of them, in the words of one of their number, took\r\ncontinual lessons _es oeuvres Cretiniques et Bouchetiques_, and some\r\nof them succeeded at last in imitating the dulness of Bouchet and the\r\npreposterous mannerisms of Cretin. Perhaps no equal period in all early\r\nFrench history produced more and at the same time worse verse than the\r\nreign of Louis XII. Fortunately, however, a true poet, if one of some\r\nlimitations, took up the tradition, and showed what it could do. Marot\r\nhas sometimes been regarded as the father of modern French poetry,\r\nwhich, unless modern French poetry is limited to La Fontaine and the\r\npoets of the eighteenth century, is absolutely false. He is sometimes\r\nregarded as the last of mediaeval poets, which, though truer, is false\r\nlikewise. What he really was can be shown without much difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clement Marot.]\r\n\r\nClement Marot[170] was a man of more mixed race than was usual at this\r\nperiod, when the provincial distinctions were still as a rule maintained\r\nwith some sharpness. His father, Jean Marot, a poet of merit, was a\r\nNorman, but he emigrated to Quercy, and Marot's mother was a native of\r\nCahors, a town which, from its Papal connections, as well as its\r\nsituation on the borders of Gascony, was specially southern. Clement was\r\nborn probably at the beginning of 1497, and his father educated him with\r\nsome pains in things poetical. This, as times went, necessitated an\r\nadmiration of Cretin and such like persons, and the practice of\r\nrondeaux, and of other poetry strict in form and allegorical in matter.\r\nAs it happened, the discipline was a very sound one for Marot, whose\r\nnatural bent was far too vigorous and too lithe to be stiffened or\r\nstunted by it, while it unquestionably supplied wholesome limitations\r\nwhich preserved him from mere slovenly facility. It is evident, too,\r\nthat he had a sincere and genuine love of things mediaeval, as his\r\ndevotion to the _Roman de la Rose_ and to Villon's poems, both of which\r\nhe edited, sufficiently shows. He 'came into France,' an expression of\r\nhis own, which shows the fragmentary condition of the kingdom even at\r\nthis late period, when he was about ten years old. His father held an\r\nappointment as 'Escripvain' to Anne of Brittany, and accompanied her\r\nhusband to Genoa in 1507. The University of Paris, and a short sojourn\r\namong the students of law, completed Clement's education, and he then\r\nbecame a page to a nobleman, thus obtaining a position at court or, at\r\nleast, the chance of one. It is not known when his earliest attempt at\r\nfollowing the Cretinic lessons was composed; but in 1514, being then but\r\na stripling, he presented his _Jugement de Minos_ to Francois de Valois,\r\nsoon to be king. A translation of the first Eclogue of Virgil had even\r\npreceded this. Both poems are well written and versified, but decidedly\r\nin the _rhetoriqueur_ style. In 1519, having already received or assumed\r\nthe title of 'Facteur' (poet) to Queen Claude, he became one of the\r\nspecial adherents of Marguerite d'Angouleme, the famous sister of\r\nFrancis, from whom, a few years later, we find him in receipt of a\r\npension. He also occupied some post in the household of her husband, the\r\nKing of Navarre. In 1524 he went to Italy with Francis, was wounded and\r\ntaken prisoner at Pavia, but returned to France the next year.\r\nMarguerite's immediate followers were distinguished, some by their\r\nadherence to the principles of the Reformation, others by free thought\r\nof a still more unorthodox description, and Marot soon after his return\r\nwas accused of heresy and lodged in the Chatelet. He was, however, soon\r\ntransferred to a place of mitigated restraint, and finally set at\r\nliberty. About this time his father died. In 1528 he obtained a post and\r\na pension in the King's own household. He was again in difficulties, but\r\nagain got out of them, and in 1530 he married. But the next year he was\r\nonce more in danger on the old charge of heresy, and was again rescued\r\nfrom the _chats fourres_ by Marguerite. He had already edited the _Roman\r\nde la Rose_, but no regular edition of his own work had appeared. In\r\n1533 came out not merely his edition of Villon, but a collection of his\r\nown youthful work under the pretty title _Adolescence Clementine_. In\r\n1535 the Parliament of Paris for a fourth time molested Marot.\r\nMarguerite's influence was now insufficient to protect him, and the poet\r\nfled first to Bearn and then to Ferrara. Here, under the protection of\r\nRenee de France, he lived and wrote for some time, but the persecution\r\nagain grew hot. He retired to Venice, but in 1539 obtained permission to\r\nreturn to France. Francis gave him a house in the Faubourg Saint\r\nGermain, and here apparently he wrote his famous Psalms, which had an\r\nimmense popularity; these the Sorbonne condemned, and Marot once more\r\nfled, this time to Geneva. He found this place an uncomfortable sojourn,\r\nand crossed the Alps into Piedmont, where, not long afterwards, he died\r\nin 1544.\r\n\r\nMarot's work is sufficiently diverse in form, but the classification of\r\nit adopted in the convenient edition of Jannet is perhaps the best,\r\nthough it neglects chronology. There are some dozen pieces of more or\r\nless considerable length, among which may specially be mentioned _Le\r\nTemple de Cupido_, an early work of _rhetoriqueur_ character for the\r\nmost part, in dizains of ten and eight syllables alternately, a Dialogue\r\nof two Lovers, an Eclogue to the King; _L'Enfer_, a vigorous and\r\npicturesque description of his imprisonment in the Chatelet, and some\r\npoems bearing a strong Huguenot impression. Then come sixty-five\r\nepistles written in couplets for the most part decasyllabic. These\r\ninclude the celebrated _Coq-a-l'Ane_, a sort of nonsense-verse, with a\r\nsatirical tendency, which derives from the mediaeval _fatrasie_, and was\r\nvery popular and much imitated. Another mediaeval restoration of\r\nMarot's, also very popular and also much imitated, was the _blason_, a\r\ndescription, in octosyllables. Twenty-six elegies likewise adopt the\r\ncouplet, and show, as do the epistles, remarkable power over that form.\r\nFifteen ballades, twenty-two songs in various metres, eighty-two\r\nrondeaux, and forty-two songs for music, contain much of Marot's most\r\nbeautiful work. His easy graceful style escaped the chief danger of\r\nthese artificial forms, the danger of stiffness and monotony; while he\r\nwas able to get out of them as much pathos and melody as any other\r\nFrench poet, except Charles d'Orleans and Villon. Numerous _etrennes_\r\nrecall the _Xenia_ of Martial, and funeral poems of various lengths and\r\nstyles follow. Then we have nearly three hundred epigrams, many of them\r\nexcellent in point and elegance, a certain number of translations, the\r\nPsalms, fifty in number, certain prayers, and two versified renderings\r\nof Erasmus' _Colloquies_.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this enumeration that the majority of Marot's work\r\nis what is now called occasional. No single work of his of a greater\r\nlength than a few hundred lines exists; and, after his first attempts in\r\nthe allegorical kind, almost all his works were either addressed to\r\nparticular persons, or based upon some event in his life. Marot was\r\nimmensely popular in his lifetime; and though after his death a\r\nformidable rival arose in Ronsard, the elder poet's fame was sustained\r\nby eager disciples. With the discredit of the Pleiade, in consequence of\r\nMalherbe's criticisms, Marot's popularity returned in full measure, and\r\nfor two centuries he was the one French poet before the classical period\r\nwho was actually read and admired with genuine admiration by others\r\nbesides professed students of antiquity. Since the great revival of the\r\ntaste for older literature, which preceded and accompanied the Romantic\r\nmovement, Marot has scarcely held this pride of place. The Pleiade on\r\nthe one hand, the purely mediaeval writers on the other, have pushed him\r\nfrom his stool. But sane criticism, which declines to depreciate one\r\nthing because it appreciates another, will always have hearty admiration\r\nfor his urbanity, his genuine wit, his graceful turn of words; and his\r\nflashes of pathos and poetry.\r\n\r\nIt is, as has been said, one of the commonplaces of the subject to speak\r\nof Marot as the father of modern French poetry; the phrase is, like all\r\nsuch phrases, inaccurate, but, like most such phrases, it contains a\r\ncertain amount of truth. To the characteristics of the lighter French\r\npoetry, from La Fontaine to Beranger, which has always been more popular\r\nboth at home and abroad than the more ambitious and serious efforts of\r\nFrench poets, Marot does in some sort stand in a parental relation. He\r\nretained the sprightliness and sly fun of the Fabliau-writers, while he\r\nsoftened their crudity of expression, he exchanged clumsiness and\r\nhorse-play for the play of wit, and he emphasised fully in the language\r\nthe two characteristics which have never failed to distinguish it since,\r\nelegance and urbanity. His style is somewhat pedestrian, though on\r\noccasion he can write with exquisite tenderness, and with the most\r\ndelicate suggestiveness of expression. But as a rule he does not go\r\ndeep; ease and grace, not passion or lofty flights, are his strong\r\npoints. Representing, as he did, the reaction from the stiff forms and\r\nclumsily classical language of the _rhetoriqueurs_, it was not likely\r\nthat he should exhibit the tendency of his own age to classical culture\r\nand imitation very strongly. He and his school were thus regarded by\r\ntheir immediate successors of the Pleiade as rustic and uncouth singers,\r\nfor the most part very unjustly. But still Marot's work was of less\r\ngeneral and far-reaching importance than that of Ronsard. He brought out\r\nthe best aspect of the older French literature, and cleared away some\r\ndisfiguring encumbrances from it, but he imported nothing new. It would\r\nhardly be unjust to say that, given the difference of a century in point\r\nof ordinary progress, Charles d'Orleans is Marot's equal in elegance and\r\ngrace, and his superior in sentiment, while Marot is not comparable to\r\nVillon in passion or in humour. His limitation, and at the same time his\r\ngreat merit, was that he was a typical Frenchman. A famous epigram,\r\napplied to another person two centuries later, might be applied with\r\nvery little difficulty or alteration to Marot. He had more than anybody\r\nelse of his time the literary characteristics which the ordinary\r\nliterary Frenchman has. We constantly meet in the history of literature\r\nthis contrast between the men who are simply shining examples of the\r\nordinary type, and men who cross and blend that type with new\r\ncharacters and excellences. Unquestionably the latter are the greater,\r\nbut the former cannot on any equitable scheme miss their reward. It must\r\nbe added that the positive merit of much of Marot's work is great,\r\nthough, as a rule, his longer pieces are very inferior to his shorter.\r\nMany of the epigrams are admirable; the Psalms, which have been unjustly\r\ndepreciated of late years by French critics, have a sober and solemn\r\nmusic, which is almost peculiar to the French devotional poetry of that\r\nage; the satirical ballade of _Frere Lubin_ is among the very best\r\nthings of its kind; while as much may be said of the rondeaux 'Dedans\r\nParis' in the lighter style, and 'En la Baisant' in the graver. Perhaps\r\nthe famous line--\r\n\r\n    Un doux nenny avec un doux sourire,\r\n\r\nsupposed to have been addressed to the Queen of Navarre, expresses\r\nMarot's poetical powers as well as anything else, showing as it does\r\ngrace of language, tender and elegant sentiment, and suppleness, ease,\r\nand fluency of style.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The School of Marot.]\r\n\r\nMarot formed a very considerable school, some of whom directly imitated\r\nhis mannerisms, and composed _blasons_[171] and _Coq-a-l'Ane_ in\r\nemulation of their master and of each other, while others contented\r\nthemselves with displaying the same general characteristics, and setting\r\nthe same poetical ideals before them. Among the idlest, but busiest\r\nliterary quarrels of the century, a century fertile in such things, was\r\nthat between Marot and a certain insignificant person named Francois\r\nSagon, a belated _rhetoriqueur_, who found some other rhymers of the\r\nsame kind to support him. One of Marot's best things, an answer of which\r\nhis servant, Fripelipes, is supposed to be the spokesman, came of the\r\nquarrel; but of the other contributions, not merely of the principals,\r\nbut of their followers, the _Marotiques_ and _Sagontiques_, nothing\r\nsurvives in general memory, or deserves to survive. Of Marot's\r\ndisciples, one, Mellin de Saint Gelais, deserves separate mention, the\r\nothers may be despatched in passing. Victor Brodeau, who, like his\r\nmaster, held places in the courts both of Marguerite and her brother,\r\nwrote not merely a devotional work, _Les Louanges de Jesus Christ notre\r\nSeigneur_, which fairly illustrates the devotional side of the Navarrese\r\nliterary coterie, but also epigrams and rondeaux of no small merit.\r\nEtienne Dolet, better known both as a scholar and translator, and as the\r\npublisher of Marot and (surreptitiously) of Rabelais, composed towards\r\nthe end of his life poems in French, the principal of which was taken in\r\ntitle and idea from Marot's _Enfer_, and which, though very unequal,\r\nhave passages of some poetical power. Marguerite herself has left a\r\nconsiderable collection of poems of the most diverse kind and merit, the\r\ntitle of which, _Marguerites de la Marguerite des Princesses_[172], is\r\nperhaps not the worst thing about them. Farces, mysteries, religious\r\npoems, such as _Le Triomphe de l'Agneau_, and _Le Miroir de l'Ame\r\nPecheresse_, with purely secular pieces on divers subjects, make up\r\nthese curious volumes. Not a few of the poems display the same nobility\r\nof tone and stately sonorousness of verse, which has been and will be\r\nnoticed as a characteristic of the serious poetry of the age, and which\r\nreached its climax in Du Bartas, D'Aubigne, and the choruses of Garnier\r\nand Montchrestien. Bonaventure des Periers, an admirable prose writer,\r\nwas a poet, though not a very strong one. Francois Habert, 'Le Banni de\r\nLiesse,' must not be confounded with Philippe Habert, author of a\r\nremarkable _Temple de la Mort_ in the next century. Gilles Corrozet,\r\nauthor of fables in verse, who, like many other literary men of the\r\ntime, was a printer and publisher as well, Jacques Gohorry, a pleasant\r\nsong writer, Gilles d'Aubigny, Jacques Pelletier, Etienne Forcadel,\r\ndeserve at least to be named. Of more importance were Hugues Salel,\r\nCharles Fontaine, Antoine Heroet, Maurice Sceve. All these were members\r\nof the Lyonnese literary coterie, and in connection with this Louise\r\nLabe also comes in. Salel, famous as the first French translator of the\r\nIliad, or rather of Books I-XII thereof, distinguished himself as a\r\nwriter of _blasons_ in imitation of Marot, as well as by composing many\r\nsmall poems of the occasional kind. Charles Fontaine exhibited the fancy\r\nof the time for conceits in the entitling of books by denominating his\r\npoems _Ruisseaux de la Fontaine_, and was one of the chief champions on\r\nMarot's side in the quarrel with Sagon, while he afterwards defended the\r\n_style Marotique_ against Du Bellay's announcement of the programme of\r\nthe Pleiade. But perhaps he would hardly deserve much remembrance, save\r\nfor a charming little poem to his new-born son, which M. Asselineau has\r\nmade accessible to everybody in Crepet's _Poetes Francais_[173]. He also\r\nfigures in a literary tournament very characteristic of the age. La\r\nBorderie, another disciple of Marot, had written a poem entitled _L'Amye\r\nde Cour_, which defended libertinism, or at least worldly-mindedness in\r\nlove, in reply to the _Parfaite Amye_ of Antoine Heroet, which exhibits\r\nvery well a certain aspect of the half-amorous, half-mystical sentiment\r\nof the day. Fontaine rejoined in a _Contr'Amye de Cour_. Maurice Sceve\r\nis also a typical personage. He was, it may be said, the head of the\r\nLyonnese school, and was esteemed all over France. He was excepted by\r\nthe irreverent champions of the Pleiade from the general ridicule which\r\nthey poured on their predecessors, and was surrounded by a special body\r\nof feminine devotees and followers, including his kinswomen Claudine and\r\nSibylle Sceve, Jeanne Gaillarde, and above all Louise Labe. Sceve's\r\npoetical work is strongly tinged with classical affectation and Platonic\r\nmysticism; and his chief poem, _De l'Objet de la plus haute Vertu_,\r\nconsists of some four hundred and fifty dizains written in what in\r\nEngland and later has been, not very happily, called a metaphysical\r\nstyle. Last of all comes the just-mentioned Louise Labe, 'La belle\r\nCordiere,' one of the chief ornaments of Lyons, and the most important\r\nFrench poetess of the sixteenth century. Louise was younger, and wrote\r\nlater than most of the authors just mentioned, and in some respects she\r\nbelongs to the school of Ronsard, like her supposed lover, Olivier de\r\nMagny. But the Lyons school was essentially _Marotique_, and much of the\r\nstyle of the elder master is observable in the writings of Louise[174].\r\nShe has left a prose _Dialogue d'Amour et de Folie_, three elegies, and\r\na certain number of sonnets. Her poems are perhaps the most genuinely\r\npassionate of the time and country, and many of the sonnets are\r\nextremely beautiful. The language is on the whole simple and elegant,\r\nwithout the over-classicism of the Pleiade, or the obscurity of her\r\nmaster Sceve. Strangely enough the poems of this young Lyonnese lady\r\nhave in many places a singular approach to the ring of Shakespeare's\r\nsonnets and minor works, and that not merely by virtue of the general\r\nresemblance common to all the love poetry of the age, but in some very\r\ndefinite traits. Her surname of 'La belle Cordiere' came from her\r\nmarriage with a rich merchant, Ennemond Perrin by name, who was by trade\r\na ropemaker. Her poems have had their full share of the advantages of\r\nreprints, which have of late years fallen to the lot of\r\nsixteenth-century authors in France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mellin de St. Gelais.]\r\n\r\nMellin de Saint Gelais[175], the last to be mentioned but the most\r\nimportant of the school of Marot, has been very variously judged. The\r\nmere fact that he was probably the introducer of the sonnet into France\r\n(the counter claim of Pontus de Tyard seems to be unfounded) would\r\nsuffice to give him a considerable position in the history of letters.\r\nBut Mellin's claims by no means rest upon this achievement. He was a man\r\nof higher position than most of the other poets of the time, being the\r\nreputed son of Octavien de Saint Gelais, and himself enjoying a good\r\ndeal of royal favour. In his old age, as the representative of the\r\nschool of Marot, he had to bear the brunt of the Pleiade onslaught, and\r\nknew how to defend himself, so that a truce was made. He was born in\r\n1487, and died in 1558. His name is also spelt Merlin, and even Melusin,\r\nthe Saint Gelais boasting descent from the Lusignans, and thus from the\r\nfamous fairy heroine Melusine. In his youth he spent a good deal of time\r\nin Italy, at the Universities of Bologna and Padua. On returning to\r\nFrance, he was at once received into favour at court, and having taken\r\norders, obtained various benefices and appointments which assured his\r\nfortune. It is remarkable that though he violently opposed Ronsard's\r\nrising favour at court, both the Prince of Poets and Du Bellay\r\ncompletely forgave him, and pay him very considerable compliments, the\r\nlatter praising his 'vers emmielles,' the former speaking, even after\r\nhis death, of his proficiency in the combined arts of music and poetry.\r\nSaint Gelais was a good musician, and an affecting story is told of his\r\nswan-song, for which, as for other anecdotes, there is no space here.\r\nHis work, though not inconsiderable in volume, is, even more than that\r\nof Marot and other poets of the time and school, composed for the most\r\npart of very short pieces, epigrams, rondeaux, dizains, huitains, etc.\r\nThese pieces display more merit than most recent critics have been\r\ndisposed to allow to them. The style is fluent and graceful, free from\r\npuns and other faults of taste common at the time. The epigrams are\r\nfrequently pointed, and well expressed, and the complimentary verse is\r\noften skilful and well turned. Mellin de Saint Gelais is certainly not a\r\npoet of the highest order, but as a court singer and a skilful master of\r\nlanguage he deserves a place among his earlier contemporaries only\r\nsecond to that of Marot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miscellaneous Verse. Anciennes Poesies Francaises.]\r\n\r\nSomething of the same sort may be said of all the writers in verse of\r\nthe first half of the century. Their importance is chiefly relative. Few\r\nof their works are conceived or executed on a scale sufficient to\r\nentitle them to the rank of great poets, and, saving always Marot, the\r\nexcellence even of the trifling compositions to which they confined\r\nthemselves is very unequal and intermittent. But all are evidences of a\r\ngeneral diffusion of the literary spirit among the people of France, and\r\nmost of them in their way, and according to their powers, helped in\r\nperfecting the character of French as a literary instrument. The advance\r\nwhich the language experienced in this respect is perhaps nowhere better\r\nshown than in the miscellaneous and popular poetry of the time, a vast\r\ncollection of which has been made accessible by the reprinting of rare\r\nor unique printed originals in the thirteen volumes of MM. de Montaiglon\r\nand de Rothschild's _Anciennes Poesies Francaises_, published in the\r\n_Bibliotheque Elzevirienne_[176]. This flying literature, as it is well\r\ncalled in French, lacks in most cases the freshness and spontaneity of\r\nmediaeval folk-song. But it has in exchange gained in point of subject a\r\nwide extension of range, and in point of form a considerable advance in\r\nelegance of language, absence of commonplace, and perfection of\r\nliterary form and style. The stiffness which characterises much\r\nmediaeval and almost all fifteenth-century work has disappeared in great\r\nmeasure. The writers speak directly and to the point, and find no\r\ndifficulty in so using their mother tongue as to express their\r\nintentions. The tools in short are more effective and more completely\r\nunder the control of the worker. A certain triviality is indeed\r\nnoticeable, and the tendency of the middle ages to perpetuate favourite\r\nforms and models is by no means got rid of. But much that was useless\r\nhas been discarded, and of what is left a defter and more distinctly\r\nliterary use is made. Had French remained as Marot left it, it would\r\nindeed have been unequal to the expression of the noblest thoughts, the\r\ngravest subjects, to the treatment and exposition of intricate and\r\ncomplicated problems of life and mind. But in his hands it attained\r\nperhaps the perfection of usefulness as an exponent of the pure _esprit\r\ngaulois_, to use a phrase which has been tediously abused by French\r\nwriters, but which is expressive of a real fact in French history and\r\nFrench literature. It had been suppled and pointed: it remained for it\r\nto be weighted, strengthened, and enriched. This was not the appointed\r\ntask of Marot and his contemporaries, but of the men who came after\r\nthem. But what they themselves had to do they did, and did it well. To\r\nthis day the lighter verse of France is more an echo of Clement Marot\r\nthan of any other man who lived before the seventeenth century, and,\r\nwith the exception of his greater follower, La Fontaine, of any man who\r\ncame after him at any time[177].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[165] _De_ Belges, though the less usual, is the more accurate form. We\r\nare at length promised a complete edition of him in the admirable series\r\nof the Belgian Academy, one of the best in appearance and editing, and\r\nby far the cheapest of all such series. He was born in 1475, held posts\r\nin the household of the Governors of the Netherlands, was\r\nhistoriographer to Louis XII., and died either in 1524 or in 1548.\r\n\r\n[166] See _Poetes Francais_, i. 532. It is perhaps well to say that M.\r\nC. d'Hericault, though a very agreeable as well as a very learned\r\nwriter, is particularly open to the charge that his geese are swans.\r\n\r\n[167] Ed. C. d'Hericault.

M.\r\nd'Hericault has prefixed a much larger study of Marot than is to be\r\nfound here to his edition of the 'beauties' of the poet, published by\r\nMessrs. Garnier. The late M. Guiffrey published two volumes of a costly\r\nand splendid edition, which his death interrupted.\r\n\r\n[171] The _blason_ (description) was a child of the mediaeval _dit_.\r\nMarot's examples, _Le beau Tetin_ and _Le laid Tetin_, were copied _ad\r\ninfinitum_.

Paris, 1873.\r\n\r\n[176] This great collection, which awaits its completion of glossary,\r\netc., was published between 1855 and 1878, and is invaluable to any one\r\ndesiring to appreciate the general characteristics of the poetical\r\nliterature of the time.\r\n\r\n[177] Much help has been received in the writing of this chapter, and\r\nindeed of this book, from the excellent work of MM. Hatzfeld and\r\nDarmesteter, _Le Seizieme Siecle en France_ (Paris, 1878), one of the\r\nbest histories extant in a small compass of a brief but important period\r\nof literature. We may hope for a still more elaborate study of the same\r\nsubject in English from Mr. Arthur Tilley, of King's College, Cambridge.\r\nAn introductory volume to this study appeared in 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nRABELAIS AND HIS FOLLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fiction at the beginning of the Sixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century prose fiction in France was\r\nrepresented by a considerable mass of literature divided sharply into\r\ntwo separate classes of very different nature and value. On the one hand\r\nthe prose versions of the Chansons de Gestes and the romances, Arthurian\r\nand adventurous, which had succeeded the last and most extensive verse\r\nrehandlings of these works in the fourteenth century, made up a\r\nconsiderable body of work, rarely possessing much literary merit, and\r\ncharacterised by all the faults of monotony, repetition, and absence of\r\ntruthful character-drawing which distinguish late mediaeval work. On the\r\nother hand, there was a smaller body of short prose tales[178] sometimes\r\nserious in character and of not inconsiderable antiquity, more\r\nfrequently comic and satirical, and corresponding in prose to the\r\nFabliaux in verse. It has been pointed out that in the hands, real or\r\nsupposed, of Antoine de la Salle this latter kind of work had attained a\r\nhigh standard of perfection. But it was as yet extremely limited in\r\nstyle, scope, and subject. Valour, courtesy, and love made up the list\r\nof subjects of the serious work, and the stock materials for satire,\r\nwomen, marriage, priests, etc., that of the comic. Although we have some\r\nlively presentment of the actual manners of the time in Antoine de la\r\nSalle, it is accidental only, and of its thoughts on any but the stock\r\nsubjects we have nothing. There was thus room for a vast improvement,\r\nor rather for a complete revolution, in this particular class of work,\r\nand this revolution was at a comparatively early period of the new\r\ncentury effected by the greatest man and the greatest book of the French\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rabelais.]\r\n\r\nFrancois Rabelais[179] was born at Chinon about 1495 (the alternative\r\ndate of 1483 which used to be given is improbable if not impossible),\r\nand at an early age was destined to the cloister. He not only became a\r\nfull monk, but also took priest's orders. Before he was thirty he\r\nacquired the reputation of a good classical scholar, and this seems to\r\nhave brought him into trouble with his brethren the Cordeliers or\r\nFranciscans, who were at this time among the least cultivated of the\r\nmonastic orders. With the consent of the Pope he migrated to a\r\nBenedictine convent, and became canon at Maillezais. This migration,\r\nhowever, did not satisfy him, and before long he quitted his new convent\r\nwithout permission and took to the life of a wandering scholar. The\r\ntolerance of the first period of the Renaissance however still existed\r\nin France, and he suffered no inconvenience from this breach of rule.\r\nAfter studying medicine and natural science under the protection of\r\nGeoffrey d'Estissac, Bishop of Maillezais, he went to Montpellier to\r\ncontinue these studies, and in the early years of the fourth decade of\r\nthe century practised regularly at Lyons. He was attached to the suite\r\nof Cardinal du Bellay in two embassies to Rome, returned to Montpellier,\r\ntook his doctor's degree, and again practised in several cities of the\r\nSouth. Towards 1539 Du Bellay again established him in a convent,\r\nprobably as a safeguard against the persecution which was then\r\nthreatening. But the conventual life as then practised was too repugnant\r\nto Rabelais to be long endured, and he once more set out on his travels,\r\nthis time in Savoy and Italy, the personal protection of the king\r\nguaranteeing him from danger. He then returned to France, taking however\r\nthe precaution to soften some expressions in his books. At the death of\r\nFrancis he retired first to Metz, and then to Rome, still with Du\r\nBellay. The Cardinal de Chatillon, soon after gave him the living of\r\nMeudon, which he held with another in Maine for a year or two,\r\nresigning them both in 1551, and dying in 1553. Such at least are the\r\nmost probable and best ascertained dates and events in a life which has\r\nbeen overlaid with a good deal of fiction, and many of the facts of\r\nwhich are decidedly obscure. Rabelais did not very early become an\r\nauthor, and his first works were of a purely erudite kind. During his\r\nstay at Lyons he seems to have done a good deal of work for the\r\nprinters, as editor and reader, especially in reference to medical\r\nworks, such as Galen and Hippocrates. He edited too, and perhaps in part\r\nre-wrote, a prose romance, _Les Grandes et Inestimables Chroniques du\r\nGrant et Enorme Geant Gargantua_. This work, the author of which is\r\nunknown, and no earlier copies of which exist, gave him no doubt at\r\nleast the idea of his own famous book. The next year (1532) followed the\r\nfirst instalment of this--_Pantagruel Roi des Dipsodes Restitue en Son\r\nnaturel avec ses Faicts et Proueses Espouvantables_. Three years\r\nafterwards came _Gargantua_ proper, the first book of the entire work as\r\nwe now have it. Eleven years however passed before the work was\r\ncontinued, the second book of _Pantagruel_ not being published till\r\n1546, and the third six years later, just before the author's death, in\r\n1552. The fourth or last book did not appear as a whole until 1564,\r\nthough the first sixteen chapters had been given to the world two years\r\nbefore. This fourth book, the fifth of the entire work, has, from the\r\nlength of time which elapsed before its publication and from certain\r\nvariations which exist in the MS. and the first printed editions, been\r\nsuspected of spuriousness. Such a question cannot be debated here at\r\nlength. But there is no external testimony of sufficient value to\r\ndiscredit Rabelais' authorship, while the internal testimony in its\r\nfavour is overwhelming[180]. It may be said, without hesitation, that\r\nnot a single writer capable of having written it, save Rabelais himself,\r\nis known to literary history at the time. It has been supposed, with a\r\ngood deal of probability, that the book was left in the rough. The\r\nconsiderable periods which, as has been mentioned, intervened between\r\nthe publications of the other books seem to show that the author\r\nindulged a good deal in revision; and, as the third book was only\r\npublished just before his death, he could have had little time for this\r\nin the case of the fourth. This would account for a certain appearance\r\nof greater boldness and directness in the satire as well as for\r\noccasional various readings. In genius both of thought and expression\r\nthis book is perhaps superior to any other; and, if it were decided that\r\nRabelais did not write it, much of what are now considered the\r\nRabelaisian characteristics must be transferred to an entirely unknown\r\nwriter who has left not the smallest vestige of himself or his genius.\r\nIt is not possible to give here a detailed abstract of _Gargantua_ and\r\n_Pantagruel_: indeed, from the studied desultoriness of the work, any\r\nsuch abstract must of necessity be nearly as long as the book\r\nitself[181]. It is sufficient to say that both Gargantua and his son\r\nPantagruel are the heroes of adventures, designedly exaggerated and\r\nburlesqued from those common in the romances of chivalry. The chief\r\nevents of the earlier romance are, first, the war between Grandgousier,\r\nGargantua's father, the pattern of easy-going royalty, and Picrochole,\r\nking of Lerne, the ideal of an arbitrary despot intent only on conquest;\r\nand, secondly, the founding of the Abbey of Thelema, a fanciful\r\ninstitution, in which Rabelais propounds as first principles everything\r\nthat is most opposed to the forced abstinence, the real self-indulgence,\r\nthe idleness and the ignorance of the debased monastic communities he\r\nknew so well and hated so much. Pantagruel is Gargantua's son, and, like\r\nhim, a giant, but the extravagances derived from his gianthood are not\r\nkept up in the second part as they are in the first. A very important\r\npersonage in _Pantagruel_ is Panurge, a singular companion, whom\r\nPantagruel picks up at Paris, and who is perhaps the greatest single\r\ncreation of Rabelais. Some ideas may have been taken for him from the\r\nCingar of Merlinus Coccaius, or Folengo, a Macaronic Italian poet[182],\r\nbut on the whole he is original, and is hardly comparable to any one\r\nelse in literature except Falstaff. The main idea of Panurge is the\r\nabsence of morality in the wide Aristotelian sense with the presence of\r\nalmost all other good qualities. After a time, in which Pantagruel and\r\nhis companions (among whom, as in the former romance, Friar John is the\r\nembodiment of hearty and healthy animalism, as Panurge is of a somewhat\r\ndiseased intellectual refinement) are engaged in wars of the old romance\r\nkind, a whim of Panurge determines the conclusion of the story. He\r\ndesires to get married; and an entire book is occupied by the various\r\ndevices to which he resorts in order to determine whether it is wise or\r\nnot for him to do so. At last it is decided that a voyage must be made\r\nto the oracle of the Dive Bouteille. The last two books are occupied\r\nwith this voyage, in which many strange countries are visited, and at\r\nlast, the oracle being reached, the word _Trinq_ is vouchsafed, not\r\nonly, it would seem, to solve Panurge's doubts, but also as a general\r\nanswer to the riddle of the painful earth.\r\n\r\nBesides his great work, Rabelais was the author of a few extant letters,\r\nand probably of a good many that are not extant, of a little burlesque\r\nalmanack called the _Pantagrueline Prognostication_, which is full of\r\nhis peculiar humour, of a short work entitled _Sciomachie_, describing a\r\nfestival at Rome, and of a few poems of no great merit. In _Gargantua_\r\nand _Pantagruel_, however, his whole literary interest and character are\r\nconcentrated. Few books have been the subject of greater controversy as\r\nto their meaning and general intention. The author, as if on purpose to\r\nbaffle investigation, mixes up real persons mentioned by their real\r\nnames, real persons mentioned in transparent allegory, and entirely\r\nfictitious characters, in the most inextricable way. Occasionally, as in\r\nhis chapters on education, he is perfectly serious, and allows no touch\r\nof humour or satire to escape him. Elsewhere he indulges in the wildest\r\nbuffoonery. Two of the most notable characteristics of Rabelais are,\r\nfirst, his extraordinary predilection for heaping up piles of synonymous\r\nwords, and huge lists of things; secondly, his habit of indulging in the\r\ncoarsest allusions and descriptions. Both of these were to some extent\r\nmere exaggerations of his mediaeval models, but both show the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of their author. The book as a whole has received the\r\nmost various explanations as well as the most various appreciations. It\r\nhas been regarded as in the main a political and personal satire, in\r\nevery incident and character of which some reference must be sought to\r\nactual personages and events of the time; as an elaborate pamphlet\r\nagainst the Roman Catholic Church; as a defence of mere epicurean\r\nmaterialism, and even an attack on Christianity itself; as a huge piece\r\nof mischief intended to delude readers into the belief that something\r\nserious is meant, when in reality nothing of the kind is intended. Even\r\nmore fantastic explanations than these have been attempted; such, for\r\ninstance, as the idea that the voyage of Pantagruel is an allegorical\r\naccount of the processes employed in the manufacture of wine. The true\r\nexplanation, as far as there is any, of the book seems, however, to be\r\nnot very difficult to make out, provided that the interpreter does not\r\nendeavour to force a meaning where there very probably is none. The form\r\nof it was pretty well prescribed by the old romances of adventure, and\r\nmust be taken as given to Rabelais, not as invented by him for a special\r\npurpose; a war, a quest, these are the subjects of every story in verse\r\nand prose for five centuries, and Rabelais followed the stream. But when\r\nhe had thus got his main theme settled, he gave the widest licence of\r\ncomment, allusion, digression, and adaptation to his own fancy and his\r\nown intellect. Both of these were typical, and, except for a certain\r\ndeficiency in the poetical element, fully typical of the time. Rabelais\r\nwas a very learned man, a man of the world, a man of pleasure, a man of\r\nobvious interest in political and ecclesiastical problems. He was\r\nanimated by that lively appetite for enjoyment, business, study, all the\r\noccupations of life, which characterised the Renaissance in its earlier\r\nstages, in all countries and especially in France. Nor had science of\r\nany kind yet been divided and subdivided so that each man could only\r\naspire to handle certain portions of it. Accordingly, Rabelais is\r\nprodigal of learning in season and out of season. But independently of\r\nall this, he had an immense humour, and this pervades the whole book,\r\nturning the preposterous adventures into satirical allegories or half\r\nallegories, irradiating the somewhat miscellaneous erudition with\r\nlambent light, and making the whole alive and fresh to this day. The\r\nextreme coarseness of language, which makes Rabelais difficult to read\r\nnow-a-days, seems to have arisen from a variety of causes. The essence\r\nof his book was exaggeration, and he exaggerated in this as in other\r\nmatters. His keen appetite for the ludicrous, and a kind of\r\nshamelessness which may have been partly due to individual peculiarity,\r\nbut had not a little also to do with his education and studies, inclined\r\nhim to make free with a department of thought where ludicrous ideas are,\r\nas it has been said, to be had for the picking up by those whom shame\r\ndoes not trouble at the expense of those whom it does. But besides all\r\nthis, there was in Rabelais a knowledge of human nature, and a faculty\r\nof expressing that knowledge in literary form, in which he is inferior\r\nto Shakespeare alone. Caricatured as his types purposely are, they are\r\nall easily reducible to natural dimensions and properties; while\r\noccasionally, though all too rarely, the author drops his mask and\r\nspeaks gravely, seriously, and then always wisely. These latter passages\r\nare, it may be added, unsurpassed in mere prose style for many long\r\nyears after the author's death.\r\n\r\nAltogether, independently of the intrinsic interest of Rabelais' work,\r\nwe go to him as we can go to only some score or half score of the\r\ngreatest writers of the world, for a complete reflection of the\r\nsentiment and character of his time. As with all great writers, what he\r\nshows is in great part characteristic of humanity at all times and in\r\nall places, but, as also with all great writers except Shakespeare, more\r\nof it is local and temporary merely. This local and temporary element\r\ngives him his great historical importance. Rabelais is the literary\r\nexponent of the earlier Renaissance, with its appetite for the good\r\nthings of the world as yet unblunted. Yet even in him there is a\r\nforetaste of satiety, and the Oracle of the Bottle has something, for\r\nall its joyousness, of the conclusion of the Preacher.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of Rabelais was immense, and of itself sufficed to\r\nprotect him against the enmity which his hardly veiled attacks on\r\nmonachism, and on other fungoid growths of the Church, could not have\r\nfailed to attract. In such a case imitation was certain, and, long\r\nbefore the genuine series of the Pantagrueline Chronicles was\r\ncompleted, spurious supplements and continuations appeared, all of them\r\nwithout exception worthless. A more legitimate imitation coloured the\r\nwork of many of the fiction writers of the remaining part of the\r\ncentury, though the tradition of short story writing, on the model of\r\nthe Fabliaux and of the Italian tales borrowed from them, continued and\r\nwas only indirectly affected by Rabelais. In this latter class one\r\nmediocre writer and two of the greatest talent--of talent amounting\r\nalmost to genius--have to be noticed. In 1535, Nicholas of Troyes, a\r\nsaddler by trade, produced a book entitled _Grand Parangon de Nouvelles\r\nNouvelles_, in which he followed rather, as his title indicates, the\r\n_Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles_ than any other model. His sources seem to\r\nhave been the _Decameron_ and the _Gesta Romanorum_ principally, though\r\nsome of his tales are original. Very different books are the _Contes_ of\r\nMarguerite de Navarre, usually termed the 'Heptameron,' and the _Contes\r\net Joyeux Devis_ of her servant Bonaventure des Periers. Neither of\r\nthese books was published till a considerable period after the death,\r\nnot merely of Rabelais, but of their authors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bonaventure des Periers.]\r\n\r\nThere are few persons of the time of whom less is known than of\r\nBonaventure des Periers[183], and, by no means in consequence merely of\r\nthis mystery, there are few more interesting. He must have been born\r\nsomewhere about the beginning of the sixteenth century, and his friend\r\nDolet calls him _Aeduum poetam_, which would seem to fix his birth\r\nsomewhere in the neighbourhood at least of Autun. He was undoubtedly one\r\nof the literary courtiers of Marguerite d'Angouleme. Finally, it seems\r\nthat in the persecution which, during the later years of Francis I.'s\r\nreign, came upon the Protestants and freethinkers, and which the\r\ninfluence of Marguerite was powerless to prevent, he committed suicide\r\nto escape the clutches of the law. Henri Estienne, however, attributes\r\nthe act to insanity or delirium. However this may be, there is no doubt\r\nthat Des Periers was a remarkable example of a humanist. He was\r\ncertainly a good scholar, and he was also a decided freethinker. He has\r\nleft poems of some merit, but not great perhaps, some translations and\r\nminor prose pieces, but certainly two works of the highest interest, the\r\n_Cymbalum Mundi_ (1537) and the _Nouvelles Recreations et Joyeux Devis_\r\n(1558). The _Cymbalum Mundi_ betrays the influence of Lucian, which was\r\nalso very strong on Rabelais. It is a work in dialogue, satirising the\r\nsuperstitions of antiquity with a hardly dubious reference to the\r\nreligious beliefs of Des Periers' own day. The _Nouvelles Recreations et\r\nJoyeux Devis_ are compact of less perilous stuff, while they exhibit\r\nequal and perhaps greater literary skill. They consist of a hundred and\r\ntwenty-nine short tales, similar in general character to those of the\r\n_Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles_ and other collections. Although, however, a\r\ngreat licence of subject is still allowed, the language is far less\r\ncoarse than in the work of Antoine de la Salle, while the literary\r\nmerits of the style are very much greater. Des Periers was beyond all\r\ndoubt a great master of half-serious and half-joyous French prose. Nor\r\nis his matter much less remarkable than his style. Like Rabelais, but\r\nwith the difference that his was a more poetical temperament than that\r\nof his greater contemporary, he has sudden accesses of seriousness,\r\nalmost of sentiment. At these times the spirit of the French\r\nRenaissance, in its more cultivated and refined representatives, comes\r\nout in him very strongly. This spirit may be defined as a kind of\r\ncultivated sensuality, ardently enamoured of the beautiful in the world\r\nof sense, while fully devoted to intellectual truth, and at the same\r\ntime always conscious of the nothingness of things, the instant pressure\r\nof death, the treacherousness of mortal delights. The rare sentences in\r\nwhich Des Periers gives vent to the expression of this mental attitude\r\nare for the most part admirably written, while as a teller of tales,\r\neither comic or romantic, he has few equals and fewer superiors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Heptameron.]\r\n\r\nThe same spirit which has just been described found even fuller\r\nexpression, with greater advantages of scale and setting, in the\r\n_Heptameron_[184] of Marguerite of Navarre. The exact authorship of this\r\ncelebrated book is something of a literary puzzle. Marguerite was a\r\nprolific author, if all the works which were published under her name be\r\nunhesitatingly ascribed[185] to her. Besides the poems printed under the\r\npretty title of _Les Marguerites de la Marguerite_, she produced many\r\nother works, as well as the _Heptameron_ which was not given to the\r\nworld until after her death (1558). The House of Valois was by no means\r\ndestitute of literary talent. But that which seems most likely to be the\r\nQueen's genuine work hardly corresponds with the remarkable power shown\r\nin the _Heptameron_. On the other hand, Marguerite for years maintained\r\na literary court, in which all the most celebrated men of the time,\r\nnotably Marot and Bonaventure des Periers, held places. If it were\r\nallowable to decide literary questions simply by considerations of\r\nprobability, there could be little hesitation in assigning the entire\r\n_Heptameron_ to Des Periers himself, and then its unfinished condition\r\nwould be intelligible enough. The general opinion of critics, however,\r\nis that it was probably the result of the joint work of the Queen, of\r\nDes Periers, and of a good many other men, and probably some women, of\r\nletters. The idea and plan of the work are avowedly borrowed from\r\nBoccaccio, but the thing is worked out with so much originality that it\r\nbecomes nothing so little as an imitation. A company of ladies and\r\ngentlemen returning from Cauterets are detained by bad weather in an\r\nout-of-the-way corner of the Pyrenees, and beguile the time by telling\r\nstories. The interludes, however, in which the tale-tellers are brought\r\non the stage in person, are more circumstantial than those of the\r\nDecameron, and the individual characters are much more fully worked out.\r\nIndeed, the mere setting of the book, independently of its seventy-two\r\nstories (for the eighth day is begun), makes a very interesting tale,\r\nexhibiting not merely those characteristics of the time and its society\r\nwhich have been noticed in connection with the _Contes et Joyeux Devis_,\r\nbut, in addition, a certain religiosity in which that time and society\r\nwere also by no means deficient, though it existed side by side with\r\nfreethinking of a daring kind and with unbridled licentiousness. The\r\nhead of the party, Dame Oisille, is the chief representative of this\r\nreligious spirit, though all the party are more or less penetrated by\r\nit. The subjects of the tales do not differ much from those of\r\nBoccaccio, though they are, as a rule, occupied with a higher class of\r\nsociety, and of necessity display a more polished condition of manners.\r\nThey are much longer than the anecdotes of the _Contes et Joyeux Devis_,\r\nand generally, though not always, deal with something like a connected\r\nstory instead of with mere isolated traits or apophthegms. The best of\r\nthem are animated by the same spirit of refined voluptuousness which\r\nanimates so much of the writing and art of the time, and which may\r\nindeed be said to be its chief feature. But this spirit has seldom been\r\npresented in a light so attractive as that which it bears in the\r\n_Heptameron_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Noel du Fail.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: G. Bouchet.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cholieres.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of Rabelais on the one hand, of the _Heptameron_ on the\r\nother, is observable in almost all the work of the same kind which the\r\nsecond half of the sixteenth century produced. The fantastic buffoonery\r\nand the indiscriminate prodigality of learning, which were to the\r\noutward eye the distinguishing characteristics of _Pantagruel_, found\r\nhowever more imitators than the poetical sentiment of the _Heptameron_.\r\nThe earliest of the successors of Rabelais was Noel du Fail, a gentleman\r\nand magistrate of Britanny, who, five years before the master's death,\r\nproduced two little books, _Propos Rustiques_[186] and _Baliverneries_,\r\nwhich depict rural life and its incidents with a good deal of vividness\r\nand colour. The imitation of Rabelais is very perceptible, and sometimes\r\na little irritating, but the work on the whole has merit, and abounds in\r\ncurious local traits. The _Propos Rustiques_, too, are interesting\r\nbecause they underwent a singular travesty in the next century, and\r\nappeared under a new and misleading title. Much later, near forty years\r\nafterwards in fact, Du Fail produced the _Contes d'Eutrapel_[187], which\r\nare rather critical and satirical dialogues than tales. There is a good\r\ndeal of dry humour in them. The provinciality to be noticed in Du Fail\r\nwas still a feature of French literature; and in this particular\r\ndepartment it long continued to be prominent, perhaps owing to the\r\nexample of Rabelais, who, wide as is his range, frequently takes\r\npleasure in mixing up petty local matters with his other materials.\r\nThus, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, Guillaume Bouchet (to\r\nbe carefully distinguished from Jean Bouchet, the poet of the early\r\nsixteenth century) wrote a large collection of _Serees_[188] (Soirees),\r\ncontaining gossip on a great variety of subjects, mingled with details\r\nof Angevin manners; and Tabourot des Accords composed his _Escraignes\r\nDijonnaises_. A singular book, or rather two singular books[189], _Les\r\nMatinees_ and _Les Apres-Dinees_, were produced by a person, the\r\nSeigneur de Cholieres, of whom little else is known. Cholieres is a bad\r\nwriter, and a commonplace if not stupid thinker; but he tells some\r\nquaint stories, and his book shows us the deep hold which the example of\r\nRabelais had given to the practice of discussing grave subjects in a\r\nlight tone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Apologie pour Herodote.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moyen de Parvenir.]\r\n\r\nThere remain two books of sufficient importance to be treated\r\nseparately. The first of these is the _Apologie pour Herodote_[190]\r\n(1566) of the scholar Henri Estienne. In the guise of a serious defence\r\nof Herodotus from the charges of untrustworthiness and invention\r\nfrequently brought against him Estienne indulges in an elaborate\r\nindictment against his own and recent times, especially against the\r\nRoman Catholic clergy. Much of his book is taken from Rabelais, or from\r\nthe _Heptameron_; much from the preachers of the fifteenth century. Its\r\nliterary merit has been a good deal exaggerated, and its extreme\r\ndesultoriness and absence of coherence make it tedious to read for any\r\nlength of time, but it is in a way amusing enough. Much later (1610) the\r\nlast--it may almost be said the first--echo of the genuine spirit of\r\nRabelais was sounded in the _Moyen de Parvenir_[191] of Beroalde de\r\nVerville. This eccentric work is perhaps the most perfect example of a\r\n_fatrasie_ in existence. In the guise of guests at a banquet the author\r\nbrings in many celebrated persons of the day and of antiquity, and\r\nmakes them talk from pillar to post in the strangest possible fashion.\r\nThe licence of language and anecdote which Rabelais had permitted\r\nhimself is equalled and exceeded; but many of the tales are told with\r\nconsummate art, and, in the midst of the ribaldry and buffoonery,\r\nremarks of no small shrewdness are constantly dropped as if by accident.\r\nThere seems to have been at the time something not unlike a serious idea\r\nthat the book was made up from unpublished papers of Rabelais himself.\r\nAll external considerations make this in the highest degree unlikely,\r\nand the resemblances are obviously those of imitation rather than of\r\nidentical authorship. But undoubtedly nothing else of the kind comes so\r\nnear to the excellences of _Gargantua_ and _Pantagruel_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[178] Among these may be mentioned the charming story of _Jehan de\r\nParis_ (ed. Montaiglon, Paris, 1874), which M. de Montaiglon has clearly\r\nproved to be of the end of the fifteenth century. It is a cross between\r\na Roman d'aventures and a nursery tale, telling how the King of France\r\nas 'John of Paris' outwitted the King of England in the suit for the\r\nhand of the Infanta of Spain.\r\n\r\n[179] Ed.

The movement and its chief promoters are indifferently\r\nknown in literature by the name of the _Pleiade_, a term applied by the\r\nclassical affectation of the time to the group of seven men[192],\r\nRonsard, Du Bellay, Belleau, Baif, Daurat, Jodelle, and Pontus de Tyard,\r\nwho were most active in promoting it, and who banded themselves together\r\nin a strict league or _coterie_ for the attainment of their purposes.\r\nThese purposes were the reduction of the French language and French\r\nliterary forms to a state more comparable, as they thought, to that of\r\nthe two great classical tongues. They had no intention (though such an\r\nintention has been falsely attributed to them both at the time and\r\nsince) of defacing or destroying their mother-tongue. On the contrary,\r\nthey were animated by the sincerest and, for the most part, the most\r\nintelligent love for it. But the intense admiration of the severe\r\nbeauties of classical literature, which was the dominant literary note\r\nof the Renaissance, translated itself in their active minds into a\r\ndetermination to make, if it were possible, French itself more able to\r\nemulate the triumphs of Greek and of Latin. This desire, even if it had\r\nborne no fruit, would have honourably distinguished the French\r\nRenaissance from the Italian and German forms of the movement. In Italy\r\nthe humanists, for the most part, contented themselves with practice in\r\nthe Latin tongue, and in Germany they did so almost wholly. But no\r\nsooner had the literature of antiquity taken root in France than it was\r\nmade to bear _novas frondes et non sua poma_ of vernacular literature.\r\nThere were some absurdities committed by the Pleiade no doubt, as there\r\nalways are in enthusiastic crusades of any kind: but it must never be\r\nforgotten that they had a solid basis of philological truth to go upon.\r\nFrench, after all, despite a strong Teutonic admixture, was a Latin\r\ntongue, and recurrence to Latin, and to the still more majestic and\r\nfertile language which had had so much to do in shaping the literary\r\nLatin dialect, was natural and germane to its character. In point of\r\nfact, the Pleiade made modern French--made it, we may say, twice over;\r\nfor not only did its original work revolutionise the language in a\r\nmanner so durable that the reaction of the next century could not wholly\r\nundo it, but it was mainly study of the Pleiade that armed the great\r\nmasters of the Romantic movement, the men of 1830, in their revolt\r\nagainst the cramping rules and impoverished vocabulary of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The effect of the change indeed was far too universal for it to\r\nbe possible for any Malherbe or any Boileau to overthrow it. The whole\r\nliterature of the nation, at a time when it was wonderfully abundant and\r\nvigorous, 'Ronsardised' for nearly fifty years, and such practice at\r\nsuch a time never fails to leave its mark. The actual details of the\r\nmovement cannot better be given than by going through the list of its\r\nchief participators.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ronsard.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Defense et Illustration de la Langue Francaise.]\r\n\r\nPierre de Ronsard[193], Prince of Poets[194], was born at La\r\nPoissonniere, in the Vendomois, or, as it was then more often called,\r\nthe Gatinais, on the banks of the river Loir, in 1524. He died in his\r\nown country in the year 1585, acknowledged, not merely in France but out\r\nof it, as the leader of living poets. His early life, however, was\r\nrather that of a man of action than of a poet, and one of the most\r\nstudious of poets. His father was an old courtier and servant of\r\nFrancis I., whose companion in captivity he had been, and Ronsard\r\nentered upon court life when he was a boy of ten years old. He visited\r\nScotland and England in the suite of French ambassadors, and remained\r\nfor some considerable time in Great Britain. He was also attached to\r\nembassies in Flanders, Holland, and Germany. But before he was of age he\r\nfell ill, and though he recovered, it was at the cost of permanent\r\ndeafness, which incapacitated him for the public service. He threw\r\nhimself on literature for a consolation, and under the direction of\r\nDaurat, a scholar of renown, studied for years at the College Coqueret.\r\nHere Du Bellay, Belleau, Baif, were his fellow-students, and the four\r\nwith their master, with Etienne Jodelle, and with Pontus de Tyard,\r\nafterwards bishop of Chalon, formed, as has been said, the Pleiade\r\naccording to the most orthodox computation. The idea conceived and\r\ncarried out in these studious years (by Ronsard himself and Du Bellay\r\nbeyond all doubt in the first place) was the reformation of French\r\nlanguage and French literature by study and imitation of the ancients.\r\nIn 1549 the manifesto of the society issued, in the shape of Du Bellay's\r\n_Defense et Illustration de la Langue Francaise_, and in 1550 the first\r\npractical illustration of the method was given by Ronsard's _Odes_. The\r\nprinciples of the _Defense et Illustration_ may be thus summarised. The\r\nauthor holds that the current forms of literature, dizains, rondeaus,\r\netc., are altogether too facile and easy, that the language used is too\r\npedestrian, the treatment wanting in gravity and art. He would have Odes\r\nof the Horatian kind take the place of Chansons, the sonnet, _non moins\r\ndocte que plaisante invention Italienne_, of dizains and huitains,\r\nregular tragedy and comedy of moralities and farces, regular satires of\r\nFatrasies and Coq-a-l'ane. He takes particular pains to demonstrate the\r\ncontrary proposition to Wordsworth's, and to prove that merely natural\r\nand ordinary language is not sufficient for him who in poesy wishes to\r\nproduce work deserving of immortality. He ridicules the mediaeval\r\naffectations and conceits of some of the writers of his time, who gave\r\nthemselves such names as 'Le Banni de Liesse,' 'Le Traverseur des Voies\r\nPerilleuses,' etc. He speaks, indeed, not too respectfully of mediaeval\r\nliterature generally, and uses language which probably suggested Gabriel\r\nHarvey's depreciatory remarks about the _Fairy Queen_ forty years later.\r\nIn much of this there is exaggeration, and in much more of it mistake.\r\nBy turning their backs on the middle ages--though indeed they were not\r\nable to do it thoroughly--the Pleiade lost almost as much in subject and\r\nspirit as they gained in language and formal excellence. The laudation\r\nof the sonnet, while the ballade and chant royal, things of similar\r\nnature and of hardly less capacity, are denounced as _epiceries_,\r\nsavours of a rather Philistine preference for mere novelty and foreign\r\nfashions. But, as has been already pointed out, Du Bellay was right in\r\nthe main, and it must especially be insisted on that his aim was to\r\nstrengthen and reform, not to alter or misguide, the French language.\r\nThe peroration of the book in a highly rhetorical style speaks of the\r\nwriter and his readers as having 'echappe du milieu des Grecs et par les\r\nescadrons Romains pour entrer jusqu'au sein de la tant desiree France.'\r\nThat is to say, the innovators are to carry off what spoils they can\r\nfrom Greece and Rome, but it is to be for the enrichment and benefit of\r\nthe French tongue. Frenchmen are to write French, not Latin and Greek;\r\nbut they are to write it not merely in a conversational way, content as\r\nDu Bellay says somewhere else, 'n'avoir dit rien qui vaille aux neuf\r\npremiers vers, pourvu qu'au dixieme il y ait le petit mot pour rire.'\r\nThey are to accustom themselves to long and weary studies, 'ear ce sont\r\nles ailes dont les escripts des hommes volent au ciel,' to imitate good\r\nauthors, not merely in Greek and Latin, but in Italian, Spanish, or any\r\nother tongue where they may be found. Such was the manifesto of the\r\nPleiade; and no one who has studied French literature and French\r\ncharacter, who knows the special tendency of the nation to drop from\r\ntime to time into a sterile self-admiration, and an easy confidence that\r\nit is the all-sufficient wonder of the world, can doubt its wisdom.\r\nCertainly, whatever may be thought of it in the abstract, it was\r\njustified of its children. The first of these was, as has been said,\r\nRonsard's _Odes_, published in 1550. These he followed up, in 1552, by\r\n_Les Amours de Cassandre_, in 1553 by a volume of _Hymnes_, as well as\r\nby _Le Bocage Royal_, _Les Amours de Marie_, sonnets, etc., all of\r\nwhich were, in 1560, republished in a collected edition of four\r\nvolumes. From the first Ronsard had been a very popular poet at court,\r\nwhere, according to a well-known anecdote, Marguerite de Savoie, the\r\nsecond of the Valois Marguerites, snatched his first volume from Mellin\r\nde Saint Gelais, who was reading it in a designed tone of burlesque, and\r\nreading it herself to her brother Henry II. and the court, obtained a\r\nverdict at once for the young poet. The accession of Charles IX. brought\r\nRonsard still more into favour, and during the next ten years he\r\nproduced many courtly poems of the occasional kind, besides others to\r\nsuit his own pleasure. In 1572 the first part of his most ambitious, but\r\nperhaps least successful, work appeared. This was the _Franciade_, a\r\ndull epic. At the death of Charles, Ronsard retired to his native\r\nprovince, where he had an abbacy, Croix-Val. Here all his poetical\r\npowers returned, and in his last _Amours, Sonnets to Helene_, and other\r\npieces, some of his very best work is to be found. The year before his\r\ndeath he produced an edition of his works much altered, but by no means\r\ninvariably improved.\r\n\r\nThere are few poets to whose personal merits there is more unanimity of\r\ntrustworthy testimony than there is to those of Ronsard. From the time\r\nof his betaking himself to literary work, he seems to have been wholly\r\ngiven to study, and to the contemplation of natural beauty. Although\r\njealous of his own great reputation, and liable to be nettled when it\r\nwas imperilled, as it was by Du Bartas, he was as a rule singularly\r\nplacable in literary quarrels. The story of his quarrelling with\r\nRabelais is late, unsupported, and to all appearance fabulous; while, on\r\nthe other hand, the passages which have been supposed to reflect on the\r\nPleiade in the writings of Rabelais can, for chronological reasons, by\r\nno possibility refer to Ronsard or his friends. Lastly, the poet appears\r\nto have had no thought of writing for gain, and though, like all his\r\ncontemporaries, he did not scruple to solicit favours from the king, he\r\nwas in no way importunate or servile. But while his personal character,\r\nas well as the extraordinary esteem in which he was held by all his\r\ncontemporaries, has never been seriously contested, critical estimates\r\nof his literary work have strangely varied. To his own age he was the\r\n'Prince of Poets.' His successor, Malherbe, behaved to him as certain\r\npopes are reported to have behaved to their predecessors,\r\nexcommunicating him in the literary sense. Boileau, with his usual\r\nignorance of French literature before his own day, described his work in\r\nlines which French schoolboys long learnt by heart, and which are as\r\nfalse in fact as they are imbecile in criticism. Fenelon was almost the\r\nonly sincere partisan he had for two centuries. But when the Romantic\r\nmovement began Ronsard was for a while almost restored to the position\r\nhe held in his lifetime, and his works became a kind of Bible to the\r\ndisciples of Sainte-Beuve and the followers of Hugo. The strong\r\nmediaeval revival which accompanied the movement was however\r\nunfavourable to Ronsard, and he has again sunk, though not very low, in\r\nthe general estimation of French critics. The history is curious, and as\r\na literary phenomenon instructive. But it is not difficult for an\r\nimpartial judge to place Ronsard in his true position. His main defects\r\nare two: he was too much a poet of malice prepense, and yet he wrote on\r\nthe whole too fluently. The mass of his work is great, and it is not\r\nalways, nor perhaps very often, animated by those unmistakable and\r\nuniversal poetical touches which in the long run will alone suffice to\r\ninduce posterity to keep a writer on its shelf of great poets. Yet these\r\ntouches are by no means wanting in Ronsard. Many of his sonnets,\r\nespecially the famous and universally admired 'Quand vous serez bien\r\nvieille,' not a few of his odes, especially the equally famous\r\n'Mignonne, allons voir si la rose,' rank among those poems of which it\r\ncan only be said that they could not be better, and detached passages\r\ninnumerable deserve hardly lower praise. But it is when Ronsard is\r\nviewed from the standpoint of a thoroughly instructed historical\r\ncriticism that his real greatness appears. It is when we look at the\r\npoets that came before him and at those who came after him that we see\r\nthe immense benefit he conferred upon his successors, and upon the\r\nlanguage which those successors illustrated. The result of his classical\r\nstudies was little less than the introduction of an entirely new rhythm\r\ninto French poetry: let it be observed that a new rhythm, and not merely\r\nnew metre, is what is spoken of. Since the disuse of the\r\nhalf-inarticulate but sweet rhythmical varieties of the mediaeval\r\npastourelles and romances a great monotony had come upon French poetry.\r\nThe fault of the artificial forms of the fourteenth, fifteenth, and\r\nearly sixteenth centuries, the _epiceries_ of Du Bellay's scornful\r\nallusion, was that they induced their writers to concentrate their\r\nattention on the arrangement of the rhymes and stanzas, to the neglect\r\nof the individual line, the rhythm of which was but too frequently lame,\r\nstiff, and prosaic in the extreme. With Marot and Saint Gelais the\r\nintroduction of less formal patterns, dizains, huitains, etc., had had\r\nthe additional drawback of making the individual verse even more prosaic\r\nand pedestrian, though it may be somewhat less stiff. Now the line is,\r\nafter all, the unit of poetry, and all reform must start with it. It is\r\nthe great glory of Ronsard that his reform did so start. From his time\r\nFrench poetry reads quite differently. Perhaps this was due to his study\r\nof the Horatian quantity-metres, where every syllable has to give its\r\nquota to the effect of the line as well as every line its quota to the\r\neffect of the stanza. But whether it was this or something else, the\r\neffect is indisputable. To this must be added a liberal, though in\r\nRonsard's own case not excessive, importation of new words from Greek\r\nand Latin, a bold and striking mode of expression, the retention of many\r\npicturesque old words which the senseless folly of the\r\nseventeenth-century reformers banished, and, above all, a great\r\nindulgence in diminutives, which give a most charming effect to the\r\nlighter verse of Ronsard and his friends, and which also were cut off by\r\nthe indiscriminate and 'desperate hook' of Malherbe and Boileau. So\r\ngreat were the formal changes and improvements thus introduced, that\r\nFrench poetry takes a new colour from the age of Ronsard, a colour which\r\nin its moments of health it has ever since displayed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Du Bellay.]\r\n\r\nNext to Ronsard, and perhaps above him, if uniform excellence rather\r\nthan bulk and range of work is considered, ranks Joachim du Bellay[195].\r\nHe was a connection, though it does not seem quite clear what\r\nconnection, of the Cardinal du Bellay to whom Rabelais was so long\r\nattached, and whose house included other illustrious members. Probably\r\nhe was a cousin of the cardinal and of his two brothers the memoir\r\nwriters. His youth was rendered troublesome by illness and law\r\ndifficulties, but at last he was able with Ronsard, whose junior he was\r\nby a little, to give himself up to study under Daurat. His prose\r\nmanifesto has already been dealt with, and almost immediately afterwards\r\nhe in some sort anticipated Ronsard's poetical carrying out of his\r\nprinciples by a volume of _Sonnets to Olive_, the anagram of a certain\r\nMademoiselle de Viole. The sonnet, however, was not such an absolute\r\nnovelty as the ode, having been introduced already by Mellin de Saint\r\nGelais. Shortly afterwards he went to Italy with the Cardinal du Bellay,\r\na proceeding which did not bring him good luck. The intriguing diplomacy\r\nof the papal court displeased him, and he soon lost his cousin's favour.\r\nA volume of sonnets entitled _Regrets_, full of vigour and poetry, dates\r\nfrom this time. But Du Bellay, deprived of the protection of the most\r\npowerful member of his family, again fell into difficulties, and finally\r\ndied in 1560 at the age of thirty-five. His Roman sojourn has given\r\nbirth to perhaps the finest of his works, _Les Antiquites de Rome_,\r\nEnglished by Spenser under the slightly altered title of 'The Ruins of\r\nRome.' Du Bellay's works are not extensive, and indeed they could hardly\r\nbe so, considering the shortness of his life and the interruptions of\r\nbusiness and study which even that short life underwent. But he is\r\nundoubtedly the member of the group whose work keeps at the highest\r\nlevel. Nor is his excellence limited to one or two tones. For grace and\r\nsimplicity his _Vanneur_, his _Epitaphe d'un Chat_, and several others\r\nof his _Jeux Rustiques_ challenge comparison. He had a strong vein of\r\nsatire, which he showed in denouncing fawning poetasters as well as the\r\ncorrupt and intriguing hangers on of the Papal court. His sonnets to\r\nOlive have the finest flavour of the peculiarly cultivated and graceful\r\nvoluptuousness which has been noted as one of the distinguishing marks\r\nof the French Renaissance. His _Antiquites de Rome_ exhibit even more\r\nstrongly another of those distinguishing marks, the melancholy sense of\r\ndeath, destruction, and nothingness; indeed, as the _Heptameron_ is the\r\ntypical prose work of this period, so Du Bellay's poems may be taken as\r\nits typical poetry. He has been called the Apollo of the Pleiade, but he\r\nshould with justice be called its Mercury as well, for, as he was\r\nperhaps its best poet, so he was certainly its best prose writer. It is\r\nunlucky that he was less favoured by fate and fortune than any other of\r\nthe greater writers of the century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Belleau.]\r\n\r\nThe position of best poet of the Pleiade--Ronsard, the greatest, having\r\nmingled a good deal of alloy with his gold--has been sometimes disputed\r\nfor Remy Belleau[196]. It is certain that his 'Avril' holds with Du\r\nBellay's 'Vanneur' and Ronsard's already-mentioned 'Quand vous serez\r\nbien vieille,' the rank of the best known and best liked poems of the\r\nschool. Belleau, whose life was extremely uneventful, was born at\r\nNogent-le-Rotrou in 1528, and was attached during nearly the whole of\r\nhis life to the household of Remy de Lorraine, Marquis d'Elbeuf, and his\r\nson Charles, Duc d'Elbeuf, whose education he superintended and in whose\r\nhouse he spent his days. He died in 1577 and received an elaborate\r\nfuneral, being carried to the grave by his brother stars, Ronsard and\r\nBaif, and by two of the younger disciples of the Pleiade, Desportes and\r\nJamyn. Belleau was the chief purely descriptive poet and the chief\r\npoetical translator of the Pleiade. He began by a collection of poems\r\nentitled _Petites Inventions_ (short descriptive pieces), and by a\r\ntranslation of Anacreon. In 1565 a more ambitious work, the _Bergerie_,\r\nmade its appearance. This is a mixture of prose and poetry, describing\r\ncountry life and its attractions. It is in this that the famous 'Avril'\r\noccurs, and there are other detached pieces not much inferior. In 1566\r\nanother rather curiously conceived work made its appearance, the _Amours\r\net Nouveaux Echanges de Pierres Precieuses_. As a whole this is perhaps\r\nhis best book. Besides these, Belleau also translated or paraphrased the\r\n_Phenomena_ of Aratus, _Ecclesiastes_, and the _Song of Solomon_. He\r\ndeserves to rank with not a few poets who have often attained a fair\r\nsecondary position in the art, and whose special faculty disposes them\r\nto patient and ingenious description in more or less poetical verse. The\r\nstately and at the same time flexible rhythm, the brilliant and varied\r\nvocabulary which the Pleiade used, lent themselves not ill to this task,\r\nand Belleau's talent, learning, and industry enabled him to give an\r\nunusually equable charm to his work. But he is altogether too\r\noccasional, too void of the higher poetical sentiment, and too limited\r\nin range, to be ranked with Ronsard or with Du Bellay. His peculiar\r\nquality of patient labour stood him in good stead in composing a\r\nMacaronic poem on the Huguenots, which is by no means without value.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Baif.]\r\n\r\nJean Antoine de Baif[197] was a man of more varied talent than Belleau,\r\nand his history and personality are more interesting. He was the natural\r\nson of Lazare de Baif, French ambassador at Venice, and of a noble lady\r\nof that city. Marriage was impossible, for Lazare de Baif, who was\r\nhimself a man of letters, was in orders; but he did his best for his\r\nson, and in 1547, when he was still very young, left him a considerable\r\nfortune. Baif was, except Jodelle, the youngest member of the Pleiade,\r\nbut he early distinguished himself by his expertness in the classical\r\nlanguages. He began in French, like the majority of his school, with a\r\ncollection of sonnets and other pieces, entitled _Les Amours de Meline_,\r\nand he followed them up with the _Amours de Francine_. Francine is said\r\nto have had over her predecessor the advantage or disadvantage of\r\nexisting. Baif then turned to the new theatre, which his comrade Jodelle\r\nhad introduced, and translated or adapted several plays of Plautus,\r\nTerence, and Sophocles, but these will be noticed elsewhere. He returned\r\nto poetry proper in _Les Passe-Temps_, a poetical miscellany of merit.\r\nLastly, in 1581, appeared a curious work, entitled _Les Mimes_, composed\r\nof octosyllabic dizains, half-moral, half-satirical in tone and subject.\r\nBaif, who was thought by some of his contemporaries to write even better\r\nin Latin than in French, was a chief defender of the often-mooted though\r\npreposterous plan of adjusting modern languages to the exact metres of\r\nthe ancients. This idea, which somewhat later seduced no less a man than\r\nSpenser for a time, and with him many of the brightest wits in England,\r\nis perhaps almost more hopeless in French than in our own tongue, owing\r\nto the omnipotence of accent and the habit of slurring almost all the\r\nsyllables of a word except one. But it was frequently entertained at\r\ndifferent times through the century, and is said by Agrippa d'Aubigne to\r\nhave been started as early as 1530 by a certain Mousset, of whom there\r\nis no other trace. Baif, who was also a spelling reformer, wrote a good\r\ndeal of verse in the metres he advocated, but with no greater success\r\nthan the other adventurous persons who have attempted the same _tour de\r\nforce_. He is also said to have conceived the idea of an Academy, and to\r\nhave in many other ways shown himself an active and ardent reformer of\r\nletters. It is for this alertness of spirit and general proficiency in\r\nliterary craftsmanship that Baif is memorable, rather than for supreme\r\nor even remarkable poetical power. His epitaphs are among his best work,\r\nprobably owing to his careful study of the hardly-to-be-surpassed\r\nexamples of this kind of composition which the classical languages\r\nafford. He was a diligent panegyrist of country life and country ways,\r\nbut no single work of his in this class comes up to the masterpieces of\r\nRonsard, Du Bellay, and Belleau. Range, variety, and inventiveness of\r\nspirit are Baif's chief merits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Daurat, Jodelle, Pontus de Tyard.]\r\n\r\nThe three remaining members of the group may be disposed of more\r\nrapidly. Daurat, the eldest, and in a sense the master of all, was, as\r\nfar as regards French composition, the dark star of the Pleiade, for he\r\nwrote nothing of importance in the vernacular. Jodelle was a voluminous\r\nwriter, but his dramatic importance so far exceeds his merely poetical\r\nvalue that he will be best treated of when we come to discuss the\r\nTheatre of the Renaissance. A somewhat curious instance of his poetical\r\nenergy is to be found in his unfinished, indeed hardly begun,\r\n_Contre-Amours_. All the rest had started with a volume of verse in\r\npraise of some real or imaginary mistress, so Jodelle determined to\r\nwrite one against an unkind lady. The seventh member of the Pleiade,\r\nPontus de Tyard, was the eldest save Daurat, the longest-lived and the\r\nhighest in station, while he was also in a way the most original, having\r\npublished his first book before the appearance of the _Defense et\r\nIllustration_. He was born at Bissy, near Macon, and, having been\r\nappointed Bishop of Chalon, died in 1603, last of the group. Poetry was\r\nonly part of his literary occupations, and literary work itself by no\r\nmeans absorbed him. But his _Erreurs Amoureuses_, addressed to a certain\r\nPasithee, and other works, give him fair rank in the school. He has been\r\nerroneously credited with the introduction of the sonnet into France,\r\nan honour which is probably due, as has been more than once observed, to\r\nSaint Gelais. But if he did not introduce the form, he at least\r\ncontributed one of its most striking examples in his beautiful Sonnet to\r\n'Sleep,' a favourite subject of the age both in France and England.\r\n\r\nThe Pleiade proper by no means monopolised all the poetical talent of\r\nthe period. Indeed, there can be no surer testimony to the real strength\r\nof the movement than the universal adherence which was given to its\r\nmethods by those who were in no sense bound to it by personal\r\nconnection. A second Pleiade might be made up of members who had almost\r\nas much poetical talent as the actual titular stars. Magny, Tahureau, Du\r\nBartas, D'Aubigne, Desportes, Bertaut, had each of them talent not far\r\ninferior to that of Du Bellay and of Ronsard, and equal to that of the\r\nfive minor members. Garnier was immensely Jodelle's superior in his own\r\nline. Jamyn, Durant, Passerat, the two La Tailles, Vauquelin de la\r\nFresnaye, even La Boetie, who had, as far as can be made out, far more\r\nvocation in poetry than in prose, are names at least equal to those of\r\nPontus de Tyard or Baif. But they did not form part of the energetic\r\n_coterie_ who started and pushed the movement, and so they have lacked\r\nthe reputation which the combined and successful effort of the Seven has\r\ngiven them. Yet Du Bartas is the one French poet of the sixteenth\r\ncentury who wrote a poem on the great scale with success, and D'Aubigne\r\nranks with Regnier and Victor Hugo in the strength and vigour of his\r\nverse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magny.]\r\n\r\nOlivier de Magny[198] was a kind of petted child of the Pleiade. His\r\n_Amours_ are prefaced by commendatory verses, among which compositions\r\nof four out of the seven--Ronsard, Baif, Belleau and Jodelle--figure,\r\nand he was as strenuous in carrying out the recommendations of Du\r\nBellay's _Illustration_ as any of the seven themselves. His _Amours_\r\njust mentioned, his _Odes_, his _Gayetes_ even, testify to the obedient\r\nadmiration which young verse-writers often show for the leading poets of\r\ntheir day. But there is no servile imitation in Magny. His life was\r\nshort, and the dates of its beginning and ending are not exactly known,\r\nthough he died in 1560. He was a lover of Louise Labe, and was worthy\r\nof her, poetically speaking. He was born, like Marot, at Cahors; he went\r\nto Rome, like many other literary men of his time, on a diplomatic\r\nerrand; and his works were all published between 1553 and his death. The\r\n_Odes_ are the best of them; the _Gayetes_ are light and lively enough;\r\nand in both his volumes of sonnets, but especially in the _Soupirs_,\r\nexcellent examples of the form are to be found. Magny had a strong\r\nfeeling for the formal art of poetry, and it was thus natural that he\r\nshould eagerly embrace the gospel of Ronsard. But besides this, he had a\r\ntrue poetical imagination, and a real command of poetical language. A\r\nsonnet in dialogue, which greatly attracted the admiration of Colletet,\r\nthe historian of French poetry in the next age, is perhaps not much more\r\nthan a _tour de force_. But many of his other pieces show real feeling,\r\nand have a certain youthfulness about them which suits well with the\r\nsentiments they express, and the ardour of literary as well as amatory\r\ndevotion which the poet endeavours to convey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tahureau.]\r\n\r\nStill younger and probably still more short-lived, but superior as a\r\npoet, was Jacques Tahureau[199]. He was born at Le Mans of a noble\r\nfamily, and died at the age of twenty-eight. But his life, if short, was\r\na happy one, and, like most of his contemporaries, he published a volume\r\nof amatory sonnets under the title, gracefully affected even for that\r\nage of graceful affectation, of _Mignardises Amoureuses de l'Admiree_.\r\nUnlike many of the heroines of the Pleiade and their satellites, who are\r\neither known or shrewdly suspected to have been imaginary, the _Admiree_\r\nof Tahureau was a real person. What is more, he married her, and they\r\nlived together for three years before his early death. Before the\r\n_Mignardises_, he had published a _Premier Recueil_, and after them he\r\nproduced a third volume of odes, sonnets, etc. All three display the\r\nsame peculiarities, and these peculiarities are sufficiently remarkable.\r\nTahureau was named by the flattery and the classical fancies of his\r\ncontemporaries the French Catullus, and the parallel is not so rash as\r\nmight be thought. It is true that it came originally from Du Bellay in\r\none of his satirical veins. But a later poetical critic, Vauquelin de la\r\nFresnaye, is more precise in his description, and oddly enough uses the\r\nvery term which was afterwards applied in England to Shakespeare's\r\nyouthful sonnets. Tahureau, he says:--\r\n\r\n    Nous affrianda tous au sucre de cet art.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Mignardises_ is indeed somewhat 'sugared' in his\r\nstyle of writing; but there are genuine passion and genuine poetical\r\nfeeling as well in his verse. Of the minor poets of the time he is\r\nprobably the best.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Ronsardists.]\r\n\r\nBefore noticing the four remaining poets who have been mentioned as\r\noccupying the highest places next to the Pleiade itself, a brief review\r\nof the minor poets until the end of the century may be given. Etienne de\r\nla Boetie wrote poems which, though they have some of the stiffness and\r\na little of the hollowness of his _Contre-un,_ possess a certain\r\ngrandeur of sentiment and a knack of diction other than commonplace,\r\nwhich explain Montaigne's admiration. Claude Buttet is chiefly\r\nremarkable for having made a curious attempt to combine the classicism\r\nof the new school with the romanticism of the old. He wrote Sapphics in\r\nrhyme, an idea sufficiently ingenious, but hardly successful. Yet it is\r\nfair to remember that some of the varieties of Leonine verse lacked\r\nneither force nor elegance. The truth is, that these classic metres are\r\nso alien to all modern tongues, that, rhymed or unrhymed, they are\r\ndoomed to failure. Jean de la Peruse was, like Magny and Tahureau, a\r\npoet who died before he had reached his term. At twenty-five few men\r\nhave left lasting works. Yet La Peruse not only produced a tragedy of\r\nsome merit, but minor poems promising more. Jean Doublet was a much\r\nolder man, and is chiefly noticeable as an example of the writers who,\r\nbeginning with Marot, or even with Cretin, and the Rhetoriqueurs for\r\nmodels, bowed to the overmastering influence of the Pleiade. Docility of\r\nthis kind, however, rarely promises much poetical worth, and Doublet was\r\nnot a great poet; but his poems, which have had better fortune in the\r\nway of reprints than those of greater men, show power of versification.\r\n\r\nAmadis Jamyn was a somewhat more distinguished poet than those who have\r\njust been mentioned. Born in 1540, he came to Paris, when the triumph\r\nand supremacy of Ronsard was completely assured, and was taken under\r\nthe protection of the Prince of Poets. He was also honoured, as we have\r\nseen, by being allowed to stand by the side of Ronsard, of Baif, of\r\nDesportes, at the funeral of Remy Belleau. He translated the last twelve\r\nbooks of the Iliad to complete Salel, and began a translation of the\r\nOdyssey; besides which he wrote a poem on the Chase, another on\r\nGenerosity, and, like everybody else at the time, abundance of\r\nmiscellaneous pieces. He was a good scholar, and there was more ease in\r\nhis verse than is usually to be found in his contemporaries (save the\r\ngreatest of them), who too often allowed their classical studies to\r\nstiffen and starch their verse. Another admirable poet, though of no\r\ngreat compass, was the dramatist Grevin. His _Villanesques_, a modified\r\nform of the favourite Villanelle, which had survived the other\r\n_epiceries_ condemned by Du Bellay, are singularly graceful and tender,\r\nepithets which are also applicable to his _Baisers_. The brothers La\r\nTaille also, like Grevin, are chiefly known as dramatists. Jean de la\r\nTaille, though but a boy of ten years old when the _style Marotique_ was\r\nswept out of fashion, had sufficient independence to compose _blasons_\r\n(and very pretty ones) of the daisy and the rose. Others of his poems\r\nhave mediaeval forms or settings, but he imitated Ronsard in his _Mort\r\nde Paris_, and Du Bellay in his _Courtisan Retire_. The works of Jacques\r\nde la Taille, who died young, were chiefly epigrams. Guy du Faur de\r\nPibrac wrote moral quatrains, which had a great vogue, and which in a\r\nway deserved it. Nicolas Rapin was, with the exception of Passerat, the\r\nchief of the poets of the _Menippee_, a remarkable group, who will be\r\nnoticed further when we come to that singular production. But Passerat\r\nhimself deserves more notice than simply as a political satirist and a\r\nfamous Latin scholar. Of all the poets of the sixteenth century before\r\nRegnier and after Marot, Passerat was the one who possessed most comic\r\ntalent. His works are full of little touches which exhibit this, while\r\nat the same time he was a master of the graceful love of poetry which\r\nimitation of the ancients had made fashionable. His Villanelle 'J'ai\r\nperdu ma Tourterelle' is probably the most elegant specimen of a\r\npoetical trifle that the age produced, and has of late years attracted\r\ngreat admiration. Vauquelin de la Fresnaye, a lawyer, the author of an\r\nArt of Poetry, and of the first satires, so called, in French, had a\r\ngood deal of poetical power, which he expended chiefly on pastoral\r\nsubjects; but unfortunately his command of language and style was by no\r\nmeans always equal to his command of fresh and agreeable imagery and\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Du Bartas.]\r\n\r\nGuillaume de Saluste du Bartas[200], the 'Protestant Ronsard,' was born\r\nin 1544 at Montfort, near Auch, served Henry of Navarre in war and\r\ndiplomacy, was wounded at Ivry, and died of his wounds in 1590. His\r\nfirst work was _Judith_; then followed _La Premiere Semaine_, and next\r\n_Uranie_, _Le Triomphe de la Foi_, and the _Seconde Semaine_. He also\r\nwrote numerous smaller poems, including one on the battle of Ivry. The\r\n'First Week of Creation' is his greatest and most famous work. It went\r\nthrough thirty editions in a few years; was translated into English by\r\nSylvester, gave not a little inspiration to Milton, and was warmly\r\nadmired by Goethe. Ronsard at first eagerly welcomed Du Bartas; but his\r\njealousy being aroused by the pretensions of the Calvinist party to set\r\nup their poet as a rival to himself, he resented this in an indignant\r\nand vigorous address to Daurat, which contains some very just criticisms\r\non Du Bartas. Nevertheless the merits of the latter are extremely great,\r\nand his personage and work very interesting. It has been said of him\r\nthat he represents, in the first place, the extreme development of the\r\nRonsardising innovation; in the second place, the highest literary\r\nculture attained by the French Calvinists. Inferior to D'Aubigne in\r\nknowledge of the world, in the choice of subjects perennially\r\ninteresting, and in terse vigour of expression, Du Bartas was the\r\nsuperior of the great Protestant satirist in picturesqueness, in\r\nimagination, and in facility of descriptive power. The stately and\r\ngorgeous abundance of the vocabulary with which the Hellenising and\r\nLatinising innovations of the Pleiade enriched the French language\r\nsupplied him with colours and material to work with, and his own genius\r\ndid the rest. His attempt to naturalise Greek compounds, such as\r\n'Aime-Lyre,' 'Donne-Ame,' and the rest, has done him more harm than\r\nanything else; but his combination of classical learning, with the\r\nvaried colour and vivid imagination of the middle age and the\r\nRenaissance, often results in extraordinarily striking expressions.\r\n_L'Eschine azuree_, for instance, is a singularly picturesque, if also\r\nsomewhat barbaric, reminiscence of [Greek: eurea nota thalasses]: the\r\nenforcement of the idea of _hora novissima tempora pessima_ in the four\r\nfollowing lines is admirable:--\r\n\r\n    Nos execrables moeurs, dedans Gomorrhe apprises,\r\n    Les troublees saisons, les civiles fureurs,\r\n    Les menaces du ciel, sont les avant-coureurs\r\n    De Christ, qui vient tenir ses dernieres assises.\r\n\r\nIn such a passage again as the following, the power and simplicity of\r\nthe diction can escape no reader; the piling up of the strokes is worthy\r\nof Victor Hugo:--\r\n\r\n    Les etoiles cherront. Le desordre, la nuict,\r\n    La frayeur, le trespas, la tempeste, le bruit,\r\n    Entreront en quartier.\r\n\r\nAll that was wanting to make Du Bartas a poet of the first rank was some\r\nfaculty of self-criticism; of natural _verve_ and imagination as well as\r\nof erudition he had no lack, but in critical faculty he seems to have\r\nbeen totally deficient. His beauties, rare in kind and not small in\r\namount, are alloyed with vast quantities of dull absurdity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D'Aubigne.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Desportes.]\r\n\r\nAgrippa d'Aubigne[201] was a few years Du Bartas' junior, and long\r\noutlived him. He was an important prose-writer as well as poet, and his\r\nlong life was as full of interesting events as of literary occupations.\r\nAt six years old he read Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; a year or two later\r\nhis father made him swear, in presence of the gibbeted corpses of the\r\nunsuccessful conspirators of Amboise, to revenge their death. Shortly\r\nafterwards he narrowly escaped the stake. For a time he dwelt with Henry\r\nof Navarre at the court of Charles IX., and there thoroughly imbued\r\nhimself with the Ronsardising tradition. But he soon escaped with his\r\nmaster, and for years was a Calvinist irreconcileable, always for war to\r\nthe knife, and as rude and bold in the council chamber as in the field.\r\nThe death of his master was unfortunate for D'Aubigne; but, though he at\r\nfirst opposed the regency of Marie de Medicis, he made terms for\r\nhimself. The publication, however, of his 'History' brought enemies on\r\nhim, and he fled to Geneva, finishing his days there. His prose works\r\nare too numerous to mention separately: the chief besides his histories\r\nare the _Confession de Sancy_ and the _Aventures du Baron de Faeneste_,\r\nboth satirical in character and full of vigour. He began as a poet by\r\npoems in the lighter Pleiade style, but his masterpiece is the strange\r\nwork called _Les Tragiques_. This consists of seven books, amounting to\r\nnot much less than ten thousand lines, and entitled _Miseres_,\r\n_Princes_, _La Chambre Doree_, _Les Feux_, _Les Fers_, _Vengeance_,\r\n_Jugement_. The poem is half historical and half satirical, dealing with\r\nthe religious wars, the persecution of the Huguenots, the abuses of the\r\nadministration, and of contemporary manners, etc. Nothing equal to the\r\nbest verses of this singular book had yet been seen in France, and not\r\nmuch equal to them has been produced since. The tone of sombre and\r\nimpressive declamation had been to some extent anticipated by Du Bartas,\r\nbut chiefly for purposes of description. D'Aubigne turned it to its\r\nnatural use in invective, and the effect is often extraordinarily fine.\r\nVery copious citation would be necessary to show its excellence: but\r\nbefore Victor Hugo there is nothing in French equal to D'Aubigne at his\r\nbest in point of clangour of sound and impetuosity of rhythm. It is\r\nnoteworthy that Du Bartas' _Semaine_, with the _Tragiques_ and the\r\ntragedies of Garnier, finally established the Alexandrine as the\r\nindispensable metre for serious and impassioned poetry in France.\r\nHitherto the decasyllable and the dodecasyllable had been used\r\nindiscriminately, and Ronsard's _Franciade_ is written in the former.\r\nBut after the three poets just mentioned, the Alexandrine became\r\ninvariable; the decasyllable being left for light and occasional work,\r\nas a sort of medium in usage as in bulk between the Alexandrine and the\r\noctosyllable. The truth is that, until the improvements of language and\r\nstyle which the Pleiade had introduced, the Alexandrine couplet had not\r\nhad either suppleness or dignity enough for the work. It was lumbering\r\nand disjointed. As soon, however, as the classical turn, inseparable\r\nfrom a specially classical metre, had been given to the language, it at\r\nonce took its place and has ever since kept it, though in the century\r\nsucceeding it was deprived of much of its force by arbitrary rules. The\r\nlines of Boileau condemning Ronsard[202] have inseparably connected\r\nDesportes and Bertaut, and have given them a position in literary\r\nhistory which is as intrinsically inaccurate as it is unduly high.\r\nNeither approaches Du Bartas or D'Aubigne in poetical excellence or in\r\nadroit carrying out of Ronsardism. But neither was in the least made\r\n_retenu_ by Ronsard's failure, and it did not enter the head of\r\nthemselves or any of their contemporaries, till their last days, that\r\nRonsard had failed. Philippe Desportes[203] was a very unclerical\r\ncleric, a successful courtier and diplomatist, a great favourite with\r\nthe ladies of the court. He was also a poet of little vigour, but of\r\ngreat sweetness, much elegance of style and form, and extraordinary\r\nneatness, if not originality, of expression. With Jamyn he was the most\r\nprominent of Ronsard's own particular disciples. His poetical works are\r\nsharply divided, like those of Herrick and Donne and some other poets,\r\non the one hand, into poems of a very mundane character, collections of\r\nsonnets after the Pleiade fashion to real or imaginary heroines,\r\ncelebrations of the ladies and the _mignons_ of the court of Henri III.,\r\nimitations of Italian verse, and the like; on the other, into devotional\r\npoems, which include some translations of the Psalms of not a little\r\nmerit. Personally Desportes appears to have been a self-seeker and a\r\nsycophant; not without good nature, but covetous, intriguing, corrupt,\r\ngiven to base compliances. He was Du Bellay's _poete courtisan_ in the\r\nworst sense of the phrase[204]. But working at leisure and with care,\r\nand undistracted by any literary or sentimental enthusiasm, he found\r\nmeans to give to his work a polish and correctness which many of his\r\ncontemporaries of greater talent did not, or could not, give. In this\r\nfact the explanation of Boileau's commendation--for it is no doubt\r\nmeant, relatively speaking, for commendation--is probably to be found.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bertaut.]\r\n\r\nJean Bertaut was, to use a metaphor frequently employed in literary\r\nhistory, the 'moon' of Desportes. Like him, he is a poet rather elegant\r\nthan vigorous, rather correct than spirited. Like him, he wrote light\r\nverse and devotional poems, and, as in the case of Desportes, the\r\nreligious poems are--rather contrary to the reader's expectation--the\r\nbest of the two. His work, however, was even more limited in amount than\r\nthat of his contemporary.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[192] The list is sometimes given rather differently; instead of Jodelle\r\nand Pontus de Tyard, Scevole de St. Marthe and Muretus are substituted.\r\nBut the enumeration in the text is the accepted one.\r\n\r\n[193] Ed.

Pierre Gringore[205], who towards the\r\nclose of his career preferred the spelling Gringoire, was a Norman by\r\nbirth. His poetical and dramatic capacity has been considerably\r\nexaggerated by the learned but crotchety scholar who was at first\r\ncharged with the joint editorship of his works in the Bibliotheque\r\nElzevirienne. But, when the hyperboles of M. Charles d'Hericault are\r\nreduced to their simplest terms, Gringore remains a remarkable figure.\r\nIt is to him that we owe the only complete and really noteworthy\r\ntetralogy, composed of _cry_, sotie, morality, and farce, which exists\r\nto show the final result of the mediaeval play--the _Jeu du Prince des\r\nSots_. To him is also due the most remarkable of the sixteenth-century\r\nmysteries, that of _Saint Louis_; and his miscellaneous poems, as yet\r\nnot fully collected, show us a man of letters possessed of no small\r\nfaculty for miscellaneous work. Gringore first emerges as a pamphleteer\r\nin verse, on the side of the policy of Louis XII. He held the important\r\nposition of _mere sotte_ in the company of persons who charged\r\nthemselves with playing the sotie, and Louis perceived the advantages\r\nwhich he might gain by enlisting such a writer on his side. Gringore's\r\nearly works are allegorical poems of the kind which the increasing\r\nadmiration of the _Roman de la Rose_, joined to the practice of the\r\nRhetoriqueurs, had made fashionable in France; but they are directly\r\npolitical in tone, and an undercurrent of dramatic intention is always\r\nmanifest in them. _Les folles Entreprises_ is a very remarkable work. It\r\nmight be described as a series of monologues of the kind usual and\r\nalready described, but continuous, and having the independent parts\r\nbound to each other by speeches of the author _in propria persona_. The\r\ntitles of the separate sections--_L'Entreprise des folz Orgueilleux_,\r\n_Reflexions de l'Auteur sur la Guerre d'Italie_, _le Blason de\r\nPratique_, _Balade et Supplication a la Vierge Marie_ (_et se peult\r\nInterpreter sur la Royne de France_), etc.--explain the plan of this\r\ncurious book as well as any laboured analysis could do. The author takes\r\nwhat he considers to be the chief grievances in Church and State, and\r\ndilates upon them in the manner, half moralising, half allegoric, which\r\nwas popular. An argument of _Les folles Entreprises_ would, however,\r\nrequire considerable space. It enters into the most recondite\r\ntheological questions, and of its general tone the heading of the last\r\nchapter tells as good a story as anything else can do: 'Comme le\r\ntres-chrestien roy et Justice relevent Foy qui estait abattu par\r\nRichesse et Papelardise.' Other works of the same semi-dramatic,\r\nsemi-poetical kind are even more directly political in substance: _Les\r\nEntreprises de Venise_; _La Chasse du Cerf des Cerfs_ (Pope Julius),\r\netc. Sometimes, as in _La Coqueluche_, the author becomes a simple\r\nchronicler describing incidents of his time. Indeed it would hardly be\r\nan exaggeration to describe Gringore's work as the result of a kind of\r\ngroping after journalism condemned by the circumstances of the time to\r\nthe most awkward and inappropriate form. In his definitely dramatic work\r\nthe same practical tendency reappears. The tetralogy is of a directly\r\npolitico-social kind. The _cry_, a summons in ironical terms to _sots_\r\nof all kinds to come and hear their lesson; the sotie, an audacious\r\nsatire on the state of things; the morality, in which the very names of\r\nthe personages--Peuple Francois, Peuple Italique, Divine Pungnicion,\r\netc.--speak for themselves, all show this tendency; and even the _bonne\r\nbouche_ at the end, the farce (which is altogether too Rabelaisian in\r\nsubject for description here), seems to illustrate the motto--a very\r\npractical one--'Il faut cultiver son jardin.' Less directly the same\r\npurpose can be traced in the _Mystere de Monseigneur Saint Loys_. This\r\nis a picture of the ideal patriot king doing judgment and justice, and\r\nserving God by his voyages over sea, and his punishments of blasphemers\r\nand loose livers at home.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The last Age of the Mediaeval Theatre.]\r\n\r\nThe first two quarters, and especially the first quarter, of the century\r\ncontributed plentifully to the list of mysteries, moralities, and\r\nfarces. The dates of the latter are not easy to ascertain, and it is\r\nprobable that most of them are older than the present period. The taste\r\nfor very lengthy mysteries and moralities, however, had by no means died\r\nout, and some of the mysteries, notably those of Antoine Chevallet, are\r\nof considerable merit. To the sixteenth century too belongs what is\r\nprobably the longest of all moralities, that on _The Just and Unjust\r\nMan_, which contains 36,000 lines, besides the _Mundus_, _Caro_, _et\r\nDaemonia_, and the _Condamnation de Banquet_ already described.\r\n\r\nThis school was continued, though under some difficulties, until a late\r\nperiod of the century. It had two things in its favour; it was extremely\r\npopular, and it lent itself, far more than the stately rival soon to be\r\ndiscussed, to the political and social uses which had long been\r\nassociated with the stage in the mind of audiences. In Beza's tragedy of\r\n_Abraham Sacrifiant_, a kind of union takes place between the two\r\nstyles. But even the triumph of the Pleiade did not at once abolish the\r\nmysteries which were still legal in the provinces, which had a strong\r\nhold on the fancy of the populace, and which some men of letters who\r\nwere themselves much indebted to the new movement, notably Vauquelin de\r\nla Fresnaye, upheld with pen as well as with tongue. Thomas Le Coq, a\r\nbeneficed clerk of Falaise, wrote a really remarkable play, _Cain_, of\r\nthe purest mystery kind, in 1580; and the troubles of the League brought\r\nforth a large number of pieces which approached much nearer to the\r\nmediaeval drama, and especially to the mediaeval drama in the form which\r\nGringore had given it, than to the model of Jodelle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beginnings of the Classical Drama.]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, this model which had the seeds of life in it, and which\r\nwas destined to serve as the pattern for the French drama of the future.\r\nIn the manifesto of the Pleiade Du Bellay gave especial prominence to\r\nthe drama among the literary kinds, in which French had need of\r\nstrengthening from classical sources. The classical tragedy in the\r\nclassical language, and even in translation, was already no stranger to\r\nFrench audiences, and the principle of constructing modern vernacular\r\nplays on the same model had become familiar to the upper and learned\r\nclasses by the practice of the Italians, with which they had become\r\nacquainted, partly through the numerous visits, friendly and hostile,\r\npaid by Frenchmen to Italy in the early years of the sixteenth century,\r\npartly through the reproduction of these Italian plays at the courts of\r\nFrancis I. and Henri II. This reproduction of foreign work was not\r\nconfined to the court, for in 1548 the town of Lyons greeted Catherine\r\nde Medicis with an Italian play acted by an Italian company. As for\r\ntranslations of classical drama, Lazare de Baif translated the _Electra_\r\nas early as 1537, and Buchanan, Muretus, and others composed Latin plays\r\nfor their pupils to act. In all these plays, Latin, Italian, and\r\nFrench-translation, the influence of the tragedian Seneca was paramount,\r\nand this influence made an enduring mark on the future drama of France.\r\nGreek, though it was ardently studied, was, from the purely literary\r\npoint of view, little comprehended by the French humanists, and of the\r\nthree tragedians Euripides was the only one who made much impression\r\nupon them. Seneca, as the only extant Latin tragedian, had a monopoly of\r\nthe classical language which they understood best and revered most\r\nheartily. His model was also peculiarly imitable. The paucity of action,\r\nthe strict observation of certain easily observable rules, the regular\r\nand harmonious but easily comprehensible system of his choruses, the\r\ndeclamatory style and strong ethical temper of his sentiments, all\r\nappealed to the French Renaissance. Within a year or two from the time\r\nwhen Du Bellay had sounded the note of innovation, Jodelle answered the\r\nsummons with a tragedy and a comedy at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jodelle.]\r\n\r\nEtienne Jodelle[206], Seigneur de Lymodin, was one of the youngest of\r\nRonsard's fellows. He was born at Paris in 1532, and was thus barely\r\ntwenty years old when, in 1552, he founded at once modern French tragedy\r\nwith his _Cleopatre_, and modern French comedy with his _Eugene_. The\r\nrepresentation was a great success, and obtained for the author from the\r\nKing, Henri II., besides many compliments, the sum of five hundred\r\ncrowns. The success of the plays also brought about an incident famous\r\nin French literary history of the anecdotic kind. The seven determined\r\nto celebrate the occasion by a country excursion, and on the way to\r\nArcueil they unluckily met a flock of goats. Deeply imbued as they all\r\nwere with classical fancies, it was almost inevitable that the idea of a\r\nDionysiac festival should strike them, and a goat was caught, crowned\r\nwith flowers and solemnly paraded, Ronsard himself officiating as the\r\ngod. This harmless freak was represented by the zealots of the time as\r\nan impious pagan orgie, in which the goat had been actually sacrificed\r\nto a false god, and the reputation of the brotherhood sank almost\r\nequally with Catholics and Protestants. Six years after, Jodelle\r\nproduced his second tragedy, _Didon_, also with great success. But he\r\nwas not a fortunate person. The miscarriage of a pageant of which he had\r\nthe direction alienated the favour of the court from him, and he was too\r\nproud or too careless to solicit its grace. He was a loose and reckless\r\nliver, and receives from Pierre de l'Estoile a character which very\r\nprobably is unduly harsh. However this may be, he died at the age of\r\nforty, indigent and ruined in constitution. His literary activity was\r\ngreat, but only a small part of his work survives, and his three plays\r\nare the only important portion of this.\r\n\r\nThe comedy has some impression of classical study, though very much less\r\nthan the two tragedies. It is, unlike the indigenous farce, divided\r\nregularly into acts and scenes; it is much longer than the native\r\ncomedy, and some of the characters show, though faintly and at a\r\ndistance, some traces of a reading of Terence. But it retains the\r\noctosyllabic metre, and its general scheme, despite a somewhat greater\r\ninvolution of plot and multiplicity of characters, is that of a farce.\r\nEugene, the hero, a rich and luxurious churchman, is in love with Alix,\r\nwhom, to save appearances, he has married to a wittol of the name of\r\nGuillaume. Alix, however, has several other lovers, among whom is\r\nFlorimond a soldier, the rejected suitor of Helene, Eugene's sister.\r\nThese personages are completed by Maitre Jean, the abbe's chaplain and\r\ngeneral factotum, a creditor of Guillaume's, some servants of the\r\nsoldier Florimond, etc. The plot is very simple, consisting of hardly\r\nanything but the return of Florimond from the wars, and his wrath at\r\ndiscovering Alix's relations not merely with Guillaume but with Eugene.\r\nHe is finally made happy with Helene. Alix takes the wise resolution to\r\nbe less prodigal of her affections, and the play ends. Some detached\r\npassages, especially the opening scene, in which the lazy, dissolute\r\nlife of wealthy churchmen is very pointedly satirised, are amusing\r\nenough, and the characters of the chaplain and the husband are not far\r\nfrom _la vraie comedie_. The tragedies are indirectly of more\r\nimportance, but intrinsically much duller reading. Instead, however, of\r\ncleaving, as _Eugene_ does, closely to the lines of the existing drama,\r\nthe innovation in them is of the boldest kind. The octosyllabic verse,\r\nhitherto sacred to drama, is exchanged in _Cleopatre_ for a mixture of\r\nthe decasyllabic and the Alexandrine, some scenes being written in the\r\none, others in the other. Nor is the tentative character of the work\r\nonly thus indicated; for the rhymes follow different systems in the\r\ndifferent scenes. In _Didon_, however, Jodelle settled down to the\r\nunbroken Alexandrine with alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes,\r\nwhich has remained the standard vehicle of French tragedy ever since.\r\nHis general scheme follows that of Seneca closely, and his choruses are\r\nwritten in stanzas of short verses regularly arranged. The matter of\r\nboth plays is taken with tolerable exactness, in the one case from\r\nPlutarch, in the other from Virgil; but a somewhat full analytic\r\ndescription of the first French tragedy must be given. _Didon_ is\r\nsomething of an advance in versification, as has been pointed out, but\r\nin other respects it is perhaps inferior to _Cleopatre_.\r\n\r\nThe piece begins with a prologue to the king, and then the first act\r\nopens with a long soliloquy from the ghost of Antony. Long speeches, it\r\nshould be said, are the bane of this early French tragedy, and for\r\nnearly a century the evil increased instead of diminishing. Cleopatra,\r\nCharmium, and Eras then appear, for the play follows Plutarch strictly\r\nenough. The queen expresses her despair, and announces her intention to\r\ndie. The first act is concluded by a long chorus of Alexandrian women,\r\nwho bewail the shortness of life in six-syllable quatrains. The second\r\nact, like the first (unless the monologue of the ghost is counted in\r\nthis latter), consists of only a single scene and a chorus. The scene is\r\nbetween Octavian, Agrippa, and Proculeius, who argue about the probable\r\nfate of Cleopatra. The conqueror is disposed to mercy and to regret for\r\nAntony's death, but his officers are less amiably minded. They agree,\r\nhowever, that Cleopatra will have to be watched for fear of suicide. The\r\nchorus now is nominally divided into strophes and antistrophes, but\r\nthese are really only uniform stanzas of six six-syllable lines each,\r\nwith the rhymes arranged a, b, a, b, c, c, and there is no epode. The\r\nthird act contains the interview of Octavian with Cleopatra, the\r\nsurrender of the treasures, and the treachery of Seleucus. The chorus\r\ntakes part in this scene both by a short song and a longer one in\r\ncouplets, but arranged in eight-line stanzas, which is preceded by a\r\ndialogue with Seleucus. The act thus consists of two scenes. In the\r\nfourth act Cleopatra repeats and regularly matures her resolve of death.\r\nIt contains two choric pieces of some beauty. The first is an undivided\r\nsong in sixes and fours; the second has a regular arrangement of\r\nstrophe, antistrophe, and epode three times repeated, consisting of\r\nfive-syllable lines, of which the strophe and antistrophe contain eleven\r\neach and the epode eight, arranged--strophe and antistrophe a, b, a, b,\r\nc, c, d, d, e, e, d, epode a, b, a, b, c, c, d, d. The fifth act is very\r\nshort, containing a recital by Proculeius of the Queen's death, and a\r\nchoric lament in quatrains. It will thus be seen that the action in the\r\npiece is very small, except in the brawl with Seleucus; that the chorus\r\nhas the full importance which it possessed in the classical tragedy; and\r\nthat, owing to the few changes of scene and the other restrictions\r\nimposed upon himself by the poet, the dramatic capabilities of the plan\r\nare not a little limited. The same state of things continued to be the\r\ncase during the whole duration of the school whose master Jodelle was.\r\nStyle and versification were sometimes better, sometimes worse than his;\r\nbut, with comparatively few exceptions, the general conception was the\r\nsame, long monologues, few characters, an almost total defect of action,\r\nwhich is conducted by the aid of messengers, etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Pleiade Dramatists.]\r\n\r\nThe fervent spirit of imitation which characterised the satellites of\r\nthe Pleiade has already been noticed more than once. But in no\r\ndepartment was it more marked than in that of drama. Jean de la Peruse,\r\nwho, like many of the Pleiade poets, died very young, produced a _Medea_\r\nimitated from Seneca, and Charles Toustain an _Agamemnon,_ also taken\r\nfrom the same author. Jacques de la Taille at a very early age wrote a\r\n_Darius_ and an _Alexander_, besides a _Didon_, which is lost. These\r\npieces have some merit, and it is noteworthy that the metre varies, as\r\nin Jodelle's model. A slight eccentricity of realism, however, has been\r\nJacques de la Taille's chief passport to a place in the history of\r\nFrench literature. The death of Darius occurs in the middle of the word\r\n_recommandation_,\r\n\r\n    Mes enfants et ma femme aie en recommanda ...\r\n    Il ne put achever, ear la mort l'en garda.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not insignificant that the verse is completed if the word\r\nis not.\r\n\r\nOf this immediate group of Jodelle's followers, however, the most\r\nremarkable before Garnier was Jacques Grevin, who was noteworthy both as\r\na dramatist and as a poet. Grevin was a Protestant and a practitioner of\r\nmedicine, in which capacity he accompanied Marguerite de France, Duchess\r\nof Savoy, to Turin, and died there, at the age of thirty. Before he was\r\ntwenty he wrote a tragedy, _La Mort de Cesar,_ which has considerable\r\nmerit, and two comedies, _Les Esbahis_ and _La Tresoriere_, which are\r\nperhaps better still. Jean de la Taille, the brother of Jacques, but a\r\nbetter poet and a better dramatist, wrote _Saul Furieux_ and _Les\r\nGabaonites_, two of the numerous sacred tragedies which have always\r\nfound favour in France, and the tradition of which it has been sought to\r\nrevive even in our own day. The theatre, like the pulpit, was used as an\r\nengine by the Leaguers, but nothing of much value resulted from this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Garnier.]\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the practitioners of this classical tragedy, notably\r\nJodelle, Grevin, and Jean de la Taille, produced work of interest and\r\nmerit, it contributed only one name which can properly be called great\r\nto literary history. This was that of Robert Garnier[207], who brought\r\nthe form to the highest perfection of which it was capable in its\r\nearliest state. Garnier was born at La Ferte Bernard in 1545, and died,\r\napparently in his native province of Maine, in 1601. He was a lawyer of\r\nsome distinction, being a member of the Paris bar, then Lieutenant\r\nCriminel at Le Mans, and finally Councillor of State. He was an\r\nimmediate disciple and favourite of Ronsard, who has spoken of him in\r\nthose terms of magnificent eulogy of which he was liberal, but which\r\nhere, if somewhat exaggerated, are by no means altogether misplaced. His\r\ndramatic works, extending to eight plays, were all composed in his\r\nearlier manhood, between 1568 and 1580. There is, however, a wide\r\ndifference between the first six plays and the last two. The former,\r\n_Porcie_, _Cornelie_, _Marc-Antoine_, _Hippolyte_, _La Troade_, and\r\n_Antigone_, are all, as their titles show clearly, tragedies of\r\nantiquity closely modelled on Seneca and Euripides, especially Seneca.\r\nThe _Cornelie_, it may be observed, was translated into English by Kyd.\r\nThey do not differ much in arrangement from each other, or from\r\nJodelle's _Cleopatre_. In his two last plays, however, produced in 1580,\r\nmuch greater power and originality appear. These were _Les Juives_, a\r\nBiblical tragedy on the fate of Zedekiah and Jerusalem, and\r\n_Bradamante_, a romantic tragi-comedy on a subject taken from Ariosto.\r\nThe latter was apparently the first of its kind, dramatists having\r\nhitherto confined themselves to classical, contemporary, and Biblical\r\nsubjects. There is, moreover, a curious incident connected with it. It\r\ncontains no choruses, and in the preface of the published edition the\r\nmanager is requested to have the want supplied in case of its being\r\nacted. Here too appears the confidant, a dubious present to the French\r\ntheatre, but one of no small importance. The play is a remarkable one.\r\nThe mixture of comic with tragic models gives the author much more\r\nliberty, of which he duly avails himself; the scenes are more numerous,\r\nthe action more lively and complicated, the interest in every way\r\ngreater. Yet it would seem, from the remark made above, that there was\r\nsome doubt in the mind of the author whether it would ever be acted. Nor\r\ndoes it seem to have had much, if any, effect on the general character\r\nof stage plays. These continued to follow the Jodelle model until Hardy\r\nbrought in the influence of Spain. Of that model _Les Juives_ is\r\nassuredly the masterpiece. The choruses are of great beauty, admirably\r\ndiversified in metre and rhythm, and occasionally all but equalling the\r\nbest lyrics of the Pleiade. There is interest in the story, which deals\r\nwith the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar on the Jewish king, and its chief\r\ndrawback is its unrelieved gloom. The first act too, which consists of a\r\nmonologue by the Prophet (unnamed) relieved only by the chorus, is\r\njustly open to that charge of monotony and absence of action, which is\r\nthe great drawback of this class of drama. Subsequently, however, a real\r\ninterest is created in the question whether the conqueror will or will\r\nnot give up his sanguinary purposes in consequence of the remonstrances\r\nof his general, Nebuzaradan, and the entreaties of Zedekiah's mother and\r\nhis own Queen. The stiffness of the dialogue, which is remarkable in\r\nmost of the tragedies of the period, is here a good deal softened. The\r\nspeeches are still sometimes too long--Garnier was indeed a great\r\noffender in this way, and in his _Hippolyte_ has inflicted an unbroken\r\nmonologue of nearly two hundred lines on the hapless spectators. But\r\nvery frequently the dialogue is fairly kept up, and sufficiently varied\r\nby the avoidance of the practice of concluding the speeches uniformly at\r\nthe end of lines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defects of the Pleiade Tragedy.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, despite the literary excellence of at least some\r\nof the work composing it, it is impossible to give high rank as drama to\r\nthe model of Jodelle. Although the unities were not by any means\r\nfollowed with the strictness which prevailed afterwards, the caution of\r\nHorace about awkward transactions on the stage was rigidly observed,\r\nand, with the usual illegitimate inference, carried out so as almost to\r\nexclude all action whatever. The personages were generally few, the acts\r\ndivided into but a scene or two at most, the set _tirades_ mercilessly\r\nlong, and the whole thing, as it would appear to a modern spectator,\r\ndull and spiritless.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pleiade Comedy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Larivey.]\r\n\r\nThe dramatists of the Pleiade school, though they chiefly cultivated\r\ntragedy, did not by any means neglect comedy, their leader, Jodelle,\r\nhaving, as has been shown, set them the example in both kinds. Their\r\ncomedy was, however, for some time a somewhat indeterminate kind of\r\ncomposition, and did not for the most part show much sign of the\r\nextraordinary excellence which French comedy was to attain in the next\r\ncentury. They seem to have hesitated between three models, the\r\nindigenous farce, the Italian comedy, which was a graft on the Latin,\r\nand the Latin comedy of Plautus and Terence itself. Yet _Eugene_, as has\r\nbeen said, is a great deal better as a play than either _Didon_ or\r\n_Cleopatre_. Its manner was closely imitated in the already-mentioned\r\ncomedies of Grevin. The _Reconnue_ of Belleau is a work of merit. Baif\r\nturned the _Miles Gloriosus_ into French under the title of\r\n_Taillebras_, which was acted with the curious accompaniment of choruses\r\ncomposed by, among others, Desportes, Belleau, and Ronsard himself. All\r\nthese pieces kept the octosyllabic verse which the farce had\r\nconsecrated. Afterwards it became fashionable to write comedies in\r\nprose. Jean de la Taille thus gave _Les Corrivaux_, Odet de Turnebe _Les\r\nMecontents_, Francois d'Amboise _Les Napolitaines_. But the chief comic\r\nauthor of the century, a better playwright than Garnier himself, was\r\nPierre Larivey, who also wrote in prose[208]. He was born at Troyes\r\nabout 1540, and died probably in the second decade of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. His father was an Italian, of the famous printer family of the\r\nGiunti, and on settling in France he had dubbed himself L'Arrive, which\r\nsoon took the less recognisable form under which the dramatist is known.\r\nPierre Larivey held a canonry at Troyes, and translated many Italian\r\nbooks of the most diverse kinds into French. Among these were numerous\r\ncomedies, and the genius of the translator for his task in this case\r\nproduced what are in effect as original compositions as most plays which\r\ncall themselves original. Larivey took the utmost liberties with his\r\nmodels, adding, dropping, altering, exactly as he pleased, and writing\r\nhis adaptations in a style excellent for the purpose. He produced twelve\r\nplays, of which nine are extant, _Le Laquais_, _La Veuve_, _Les\r\nEsprits_, _Le Morfondu_, _Les Jaloux_, _Les Escoliers_, published in\r\n1579, and _Constance_, _Le Fidele_, _Les Tromperies_, published in 1611.\r\nEach of these has an Italian original. But, as the originals themselves\r\nare frequently derived from classical sources, Larivey very often seems\r\nto be imitating these latter. A nearly complete idea of the character of\r\nhis best piece, _Les Esprits_, may be obtained by those who know the\r\n_Aulularia_ and _Andria_, and, on the other hand, the _Ecole des Maris_\r\nand _L'Avare_, for he stands about midway between the classical comedies\r\nof Latin and French. Moliere found a good deal of his property in\r\nLarivey, and so did other French comic authors.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[205] Ed. Hericault, Montaiglon, and Rothschild. 2 vols.

The four most\r\nremarkable of the remaining prose authors of the century illustrate\r\nthese characteristics as vividly but less universally. Montaigne indeed\r\nis almost as complete a representative of the entire character for the\r\nlast half of the century as Rabelais is of the first. But even in him\r\none note, the note of sceptical philosophy, is more dominant than any to\r\nbe found in Rabelais. In the same way Calvin was the first, if not the\r\nmost distinguished, of theologians who wrote modern French prose; Amyot\r\nthe representative of erudition; and Brantome of that attention to\r\nmundane business and pleasure which produced so many admirable\r\nmemoir-writers. Round each of the four, but especially round Amyot and\r\nBrantome, numerous figures, sometimes of hardly less magnitude, have to\r\nbe grouped. Chronological reasons, and the convenience of subdividing\r\nthe subject, make it, however, advisable to take Calvin and Amyot first,\r\nleaving the authors of the _Essais_ and the _Dames Galantes_ with their\r\ntrain for another chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin.]\r\n\r\nJean Calvin[209] was born in 1509, at Noyon, in Picardy, where his\r\nfather held the post of procurator-fiscal to the bishop. He took orders\r\nvery early, and obtained some preferment. Before long, by a transition\r\nvery usual in that age, he exchanged divinity for law; but his interest\r\nwas still in the former study, and he eagerly embraced the Reformed\r\ndoctrines. Like other French reformers, he was at first rewarded by the\r\nfavour of Francis and his sister Marguerite, but the tide soon turned,\r\nand he left France in 1534 for Basle. It is said that it was not till\r\nthen that he learnt Hebrew. At Basle his _Institution_ was published.\r\nAfter a year or two he went to Italy, where he was received by the\r\nDuchess of Ferrara, Renee of France, the steadiest of all the royal\r\npatrons of the French reformers. At last he established himself at\r\nGeneva, where, as is well known, he succeeded in setting up a kind of\r\ntheocratic tyranny, which was for centuries the model and pattern of his\r\nfaithful followers the Scotch Presbyterians. He was once banished, but\r\nrecalled, and exercised his sway for about a quarter of a century. Into\r\nthe too famous and much argued matters of his relations with Servetus,\r\nhis intrigues with the French inquisitors to establish a kind of\r\n_Zollverein_ of persecution and the like, there is no need to enter\r\nhere. He died in 1564. Calvin's greatest work in literature, as in\r\ntheology, is the _Institution of the Christian Religion_, which, as has\r\nbeen said, was published at Basle in 1536. It was written in Latin, but\r\nfour years later was republished in French, the author himself being the\r\ntranslator. The minor works of Calvin, both in Latin and French, are\r\nvery numerous, but from the point of view of literary history they may\r\nbe neglected, except certain satirical pamphlets wherein the writer\r\ndisplayed a considerable command of vigorous, if occasionally clumsy,\r\nsatire and invective. The scurrility with which the debates of the\r\nReformation were carried on on both sides is but too well known. Calvin\r\nwas not so guilty in this respect as Luther, but he must bear a\r\nconsiderable portion of the blame. What is really valuable in Calvin's\r\nsatiric style may be found more worthily represented in the less\r\nabstract passages of the _Institution_, notably the Address to the King.\r\n\r\nThe _Institution_ itself is beyond all question the first serious work\r\nof great literary merit, not historical, in the history of French prose.\r\nIt is strongly Latinised in form and construction, as might indeed be\r\nexpected considering the circumstances of its production. But the point\r\nin which it differs from preceding works in which the classical\r\ninfluence is prominent, is that the author no longer attempts to give\r\nhis classical colour by means of wholesale importations of terms. The\r\nvocabulary, though rich and varied, is still in the main genuine French,\r\nand the Latinism is more observable in occasional constructions and in\r\nthe architecture of the clauses than in the mere selection of words.\r\nThis clause-architecture was a matter of the last importance, for it was\r\nexactly in this respect that French, like most of the vernacular\r\ntongues, was deficient. The entirely artless and mainly conversational\r\narray of the sentence which, out of verse, had hitherto been common,\r\nserved for narrative well enough, but not at all for argument or\r\ndiscussion. Calvin threw his French clauses into the mould in which his\r\nLatin had been cast, and without unduly stiffening them produced a\r\nregularity of form which was entirely novel. Even when his sentences are\r\nof considerable length, there is clearness and simplicity in them, which\r\nin some languages, English for instance, was not generally reached in\r\nprose till much later. It is remarkable, too, that the besetting sin of\r\nserious French prose, its tendency to the declamatory, is well kept\r\nunder by Calvin. Next to the graceful stateliness of his phrase, its\r\nextreme sobriety, not rejecting legitimate ornament, but seldom or never\r\ntrespassing into the rhetorical, has to be observed. Considering that\r\nthe whole of it was written before the author was seven-and-twenty, it\r\nis perhaps the most remarkable work of its particular kind to be\r\nanywhere found--the merits being those of full maturity and elaborate\r\npreparation rather than of youthful exuberance. The book consists of\r\nfour parts; the first on God, the second on the Atonement, or rather on\r\nthe Mediatorial Office of Christ, the third on the results of that\r\nOffice, the fourth on Church Government. Its end, it need hardly be\r\nsaid, is double--the establishment in the most rigorous form of the\r\ndoctrine of predestination and original sin, and the destruction of the\r\nsacramental and sacerdotal doctrines of the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Reformers and Controversialists.]\r\n\r\nDespite the fervid interest taken in religious disputation and the\r\nmasterly example which Calvin had set both to friends and foes, theology\r\nproper did not contribute very much of value to literature during the\r\nperiod. Beza wrote chiefly in Latin, his _Histoire des Eglises\r\nReformees_ being the chief exception. Pierre Viret, a Swiss by birth,\r\nwho passed the last twenty years of his life at various towns in the\r\nsouth of France as a preacher and theological teacher, wrote a\r\nconsiderable number of treatises, both serious and satirical. The titles\r\nof some of the latter, _L'Alchimie du Purgatoire_, _La Cosmographie\r\nInfernale_, etc., are characteristic of the time. But Viret's literary\r\nmerit was not remarkable. This kind of theological pasquinading was in\r\ngreat favour throughout the period, and authors of very various merit,\r\nsuch as Marnix de Sainte Aldegonde, Dore, Claude de Saintes, Arthus\r\nDesire, and others, contributed plentifully to it. But the interest of\r\ntheir work is for the most part historical and antiquarian only. The\r\ntitle of 'Protestant Rabelais' has been absurdly given to Marnix. It is\r\nonly so far deserved that the scurril language and gross images which\r\nwith the master were but accessories, were with the pupil the main\r\npoint. In the latter part of the century, after the quieting of the\r\ntroubles of the League, two more serious disputants arose, each of\r\nconsiderable literary eminence. These were on the Protestant side,\r\nPhilippe de Mornay, better known as Duplessis-Mornay, who distinguished\r\nhimself equally as a soldier, a diplomatist, and a man of letters, and\r\nthe still more famous Cardinal Du Perron, a converted Calvinist, who was\r\nsupposed to be the most expert controversialist of a time which was\r\nnothing if not controversial. The chief theological work of\r\nDuplessis-Mornay was his _Traite de la Verite de la Religion\r\nChretienne_. The chief written theological work of Du Perron was a\r\n_Traite du Sacrement de l'Euchariste_, in reply to a work on the same\r\nsubject by Mornay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preachers of the League.]\r\n\r\nBetween the controversies of the earlier part of the century and those\r\nof the latter, preaching, if not dogmatic theology, held an important\r\nplace because of its political bearing. The pulpit style of the\r\nsixteenth century was for the most part an aggravation of that (already\r\ndescribed) of the fifteenth, the acrimony of sectarian and factious\r\npartisanship leading the preachers to indulge in every kind of verbal\r\nexcess. During the League the partisans of that organisation, especially\r\nin Paris, were perpetually excited against Henri III. and his successor\r\nby the most atrocious pulpit diatribes, the chief artists in which were\r\nBoucher, Rose, Launay, Feuardent, and Genebrard. The literary value of\r\nthese furious outpourings however is very small. After their cessation a\r\nreaction set in, and for some time before the splendid period of pulpit\r\neloquence, which lasted from St. Francis de Sales to Massillon, the\r\ngeneral style of French homiletics was dull and laboured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amyot.]\r\n\r\nJacques Amyot[210] was born at Melun in 1513, and belonged to the lowest\r\nclass. He was educated as a servitor at the famous College de Navarre,\r\nand took his degree in arts at the age of nineteen. He then held various\r\ntutorships and attracted the notice of Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, the\r\nconstant patroness of men of letters, who gave him a Readership at\r\nBourges. After some years of University teaching in the classics, he\r\nbegan his series of translations with the _Theagenes and Chariclea_ in\r\n1546. This was three years in advance of Du Bellay's manifesto, and\r\nthough not a few translations had already appeared, none had even\r\napproached Amyot's in elegance. As usual at the time his literary\r\nreputation was rewarded by Church preferment and employment in the\r\ndiplomatic service. He was also made tutor to Charles IX. and Henri of\r\nAnjou. His elder pupil, when he came to the throne, made him, first,\r\nGrand Almoner of France, and then Bishop of Auxerre, while Henri III.\r\nadded the honour of a commandership in the order of the Holy Ghost. For\r\na time, in the midst of the troubles of the League, Amyot was driven\r\nfrom his palace, but he returned and died, at the full age of fourscore,\r\nin 1594.\r\n\r\nBesides the work of Heliodorus, Amyot translated Diodorus Siculus\r\n(1554), _Daphnis and Chloe_, Plutarch's _Lives_ (1559), and Plutarch's\r\n_Morals_ (1574). It may seem at first sight that his selection of\r\nauthors to translate was somewhat peculiar. It was however, either by\r\naccident or design, singularly well suited to the age which he\r\naddressed. The positive merit of Heliodorus, and still more of Longus,\r\nis certainly greater than is usually admitted nowadays. But for that\r\ntime they were peculiarly suited (and especially Longus) by their\r\ncombination of romantic and adventurous description with graceful\r\npictures of nature and amatory interludes. Plutarch, on the other hand,\r\nexpressed, more than any other author, the practical and moralising\r\nspirit which accompanied this taste for romance. Montaigne confessed\r\nthat he could not do without Plutarch, and it may be doubted whether any\r\nother single author of antiquity, after the Ciceronian mania was over,\r\nexercised such an influence as Plutarch, through Amyot, North, and\r\nShakespeare (a direct succession of channels), upon France and England.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the translator had not a little to do with the success of\r\nthe books. Here is the testimony of the greatest in a literary sense of\r\nAmyot's readers. 'I give,' says Montaigne, 'and I think I am right in\r\ndoing so, the palm to Jacques Amyot over all French writers, not only\r\nfor the simplicity and purity of his vocabulary, in which he surpasses\r\nall others, nor for his industry in so long a task, nor for the depth of\r\nhis learning which has enabled him to expound so happily a writer so\r\nthorny and crabbed. I am above all grateful to him for having selected\r\nand chosen a book so worthy and so suitable as a present to his country.\r\nWe dunces were lost had not this book plucked us out of the mire. Thanks\r\nto it, we dare to speak and to write. By it ladies are in a position to\r\ngive lessons to schoolmasters. It is our very breviary.' This praise,\r\nwhich is not exaggerated in itself, and still less when taken as an\r\nexpression of the feeling of the time, refers of course to the\r\n'Plutarch,' and in estimating it it is necessary to take account of\r\nMontaigne's especial affection for the author translated. But if we take\r\nin the lighter work, and especially the _Daphnis and Chloe_, Amyot will\r\nstand higher, not lower. His merit is not so much that he has known how\r\nto adjust himself and his style to two very different authors, but that\r\nin rendering both those authors he has written French of a most original\r\nmodel and of the greatest excellence. The common fault of translation,\r\nthe insensible adoption of a foreign idiom--especially difficult to\r\navoid at a time when no classical standards or models of the tongue used\r\nby the translator exist--is here almost entirely overcome. The style of\r\nAmyot, who had little before him, if Calvin and Rabelais be excepted,\r\nbut the clumsy examples of the _rhetoriqueur_ school, is, as Montaigne\r\njustly says, perfectly simple and pure; and so little is it tinged\r\neither with archaism or with classicism that the seventeenth century\r\nitself, unjust as it was for the most part towards its predecessors,\r\nacknowledged its merit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Translators.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dolet.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Amyot was by far the most considerable of the French\r\ntranslators of the sixteenth century, he was not by any means the first.\r\nClaude de Seyssel translated many Greek authors, Pierre Saliat produced\r\na version of Herodotus, Lefevre d'Etaples was the author of the first\r\ncomplete French translation of the Bible, and a cluster of learned\r\nwriters, some of them remarkable for other work, such as Bonaventure des\r\nPeriers, devoted themselves to Plato. Among these latter there is one\r\nwho was in many ways a typical representative of the time. Etienne\r\nDolet[211] was born at Orleans in 1509, lived a stormy life diversified\r\nby many quarrels, literary and theological, did much service to\r\nliterature both in Latin and French, and, falling out with the powers\r\nthat were, was burnt (having first been, as a matter of grace and in\r\nconsequence of a previous recantation, hanged) in the Place Maubert, at\r\nParis, on his birthday, August 3, 1554. Dolet had written many Latin\r\nspeeches and tractates in the Ciceronian style--that of a curious\r\nsection of humanists who entertained an exclusive and exaggerated\r\ndevotion to Cicero. Then, becoming himself a master-printer, he wrote\r\nseveral small treatises on French grammar, some poems, a short history\r\nof Francis the First, and finally, a translation of the Platonic or\r\nPseudo-Platonic _Axiochus_, which was the proximate cause of his death.\r\nHe was one of the earliest of the French humanist students to devote\r\nhimself to the vernacular, and, though his short and troubled life did\r\nnot enable him to perfect his French style, he is very interesting as a\r\nspecimen. His friendship with Marot and Rabelais had in each case an\r\nunhappy end. In the latter this was due to a pirated edition of\r\n_Pantagruel_ and _Gargantua_, which reproduced expressions that\r\nRabelais, in the rising storm of persecution, had been anxious to\r\nmodify. As a Latin scholar Dolet was accurate and sound. His\r\ntranslations suffer somewhat from the want of a sufficiently definite\r\nand flexible French style, but the striving after such a style is\r\napparent in them.\r\n\r\nDolet and the other persons just mentioned had translated for the most\r\npart prose into prose. Sanxon, Hugues Salel, Lazare de Baif, Sibilet,\r\nand others, translated verse into verse; but the theory of French\r\nversification had not as yet been sufficiently studied to make the\r\nattempt really profitable. After the innovations of the Pleiade many of\r\nRonsard's followers bent themselves to the same task with a better\r\nequipment and with more success. Almost all the poets mentioned\r\nelsewhere executed translations of more or less merit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fauchet.]\r\n\r\nFrom a literary point of view, however, the exercises of the century, in\r\nwhat may be called applied scholarship, were, leaving out of sight for\r\nthe moment Amyot's work, and also that, presently to be mentioned, of\r\nHerberay, of greater merit than its pure translations. All the mediaeval\r\nlegends, assigning classical or semi-classical origins to the\r\npopulations of France, were resumed and amplified by Jean Lemaire de\r\nBelges, in the first years of the century, in his _Illustrations des\r\nGaules_. Lemaire belongs, as has been said elsewhere, for the most part\r\nto the earlier school of the Rhetoriqueurs, but his literary power was\r\nconsiderable. The style of research, mingling as it did antiquarian and\r\nhistorical elements with a strong infusion of what was purely literary,\r\nwas illustrated during the period by three persons who deserve special\r\nmention. Claude Fauchet is a name of great importance in French literary\r\nhistory. So long as mediaeval literature actually flourished we should\r\nexpect to find, and we do find, no attention paid to its history and\r\ndevelopment. Fauchet was the first person, so far as is known, who\r\ndevoted himself to something like a critical examination of its\r\nresults; and as many of the materials which he had at his disposal have\r\nperished, his work, with all its drawbacks, is still very valuable. His\r\n_Antiquites Gauloises et Francoises_ are purely historical, but display\r\na sound spirit of criticism. His _Recueil de l'Origine de la Langue et\r\nPoesie Francoise, Ryme et Romans, plus les Noms et Sommaires des\r\nOeuvres de CXXVII Poetes Francois vivans avant l'an MCCC_, is a work\r\nfor its period (1581) almost unique. Philologically, of course, Fauchet\r\nis far from infallible, as, for instance, in his theory, obviously\r\nindefensible, that French is a cross between the tongues of the Gauls\r\nand the Romans. But his 'Noms et Sommaires' are actually taken from the\r\nstudy of manuscripts; and, as the works of the Trouveres had, with few\r\nexceptions, long dropped out of sight, except in late fifteenth-century\r\nprose versions, the attempt to make them known was as salutary as it was\r\nbold.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pasquier.]\r\n\r\nFauchet unfortunately was not a good writer. This cannot be said of his\r\nprincipal rival, or rather successor, Etienne Pasquier. Pasquier was\r\nborn at Paris in 1529, and early devoted himself to legal studies, which\r\nhe pursued all through his life. His most famous performance as an\r\nadvocate was his speech for the University of Paris against the Jesuits\r\nin 1565. He afterwards took a vigorous part in the Royalist polemic\r\nagainst the League. He did not die till 1615. His works, as yet\r\nunpublished in a complete form, are in modern times accessible chiefly\r\nin the selection of M. Leon Feugere[212]. They are voluminous, but by\r\nfar the most important (with the exception perhaps of the valuable\r\n_Letters_) is the _Recherches de la France_. This is a somewhat\r\ndesultory but very interesting collection of remarks on politics,\r\nhistory, social changes, and last, not least, literature. To us the most\r\nattractive part of Pasquier's literary history is the account he gives\r\nof the great poetical and literary movement of his own day, the\r\nrevolution of the Pleiade, or, as he describes it picturesquely, 'De la\r\nGrande Flotte de Poetes que produisit le Regne du Roi Henry Deuxieme.'\r\nBut his notes on the previous history of literature in France, though\r\nnecessarily based on somewhat imperfect knowledge, are full of\r\ninterest, and not destitute of instruction, such, for instance, as his\r\nchapters on the farce of _Pathelin_, on Provencal poetry, on the formal\r\nmeasures of the fourteenth century, etc. Pasquier's style is very\r\ndelightful. Despite his erudition, and even what may be called his\r\nRonsardising, he does not aim at the new severity and classicism. But\r\nhis manner is exceedingly picturesque, perfectly clear, and\r\ndistinguished by a sort of gossiping ingenuousness without any lack of\r\ndignity, the secret of which the sixteenth and early seventeenth\r\ncenturies in France and England seem to have possessed and carried off\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henri Estienne.]\r\n\r\nThe third of three not dissimilar names is that of Henri Estienne. His\r\nremarkable _Apologie pour Herodote_, like not a few other works of the\r\nsame kind, would be less remarkable if it were stripped of borrowed\r\nplumes; but his three treatises on French linguistics, the _Traite de la\r\nConformite du Francais avec le Grec_, the _Precellence de la Langue\r\nFrancaise_, and the _Nouveaux Dialogues de Langage Francais Italianise_,\r\nwould give him a considerable place in the history of French literature\r\nif he had written no _Apologie_ and published no _Thesaurus_. All three\r\nworks are more or less directed against the Italianising mania of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Herberay.]\r\n\r\nHere, perhaps, better than elsewhere, may be mentioned the name of one\r\nof the best, if not the best, purely narrative writer of French prose\r\nduring the century, Herberay des Essarts. It is to Herberay that the\r\nfamous romance of _Amadis of Gaul_ owes most of its fame. According to\r\nthe most probable story, the _Amadis_ was originally translated by the\r\nSpaniard Montalvo from a lost Portuguese original of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. There is absolutely no trace of a French original, the\r\nexistence of which has been assumed by French critics. In form the\r\n_Amadis_ is a long prose Roman d'Aventures, distinguished only from its\r\nFrench companions and predecessors by a somewhat higher strain of\r\nromantic sentiment, and by a greater abundance of giants, dwarfs,\r\nwitches, and other condiments, which, even in its most luxuriant day,\r\nthe simpler and more academic French taste had known how to do without,\r\nor at most, to apply moderately. It had been continued in the Spanish by\r\nmore than one author, and was a very voluminous work when, in 1540,\r\nHerberay undertook to give a French version of it. He, in his turn, had\r\ncontinuators, but none who equalled his popularity or power. Readers of\r\nthe Spanish complain that Herberay has not been a faithful translator,\r\nand, in particular, that he has been guilty of no few anachronisms. He\r\nprobably troubled himself very little about exact fidelity or strict\r\nlocal and temporal colour. But he ranks, in order of time, second only\r\nto Calvin in the production of a clear, elegant, and scholarly French\r\nprose style. The book became immensely popular. It is said that it was\r\nthe usual reading book for foreign students of French for a considerable\r\nperiod, and it was highly thought of by the best critics (such as\r\nPasquier) of its own and the next generation. It had moreover a great\r\ninfluence on what came after it. To no single book can be so clearly\r\ntraced the heroic romances of the early seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Palissy.]\r\n\r\nIt may seem somewhat premature to speak of scientific writers in the\r\nsixteenth century. Yet there are three who usually and deservedly hold a\r\nplace in French literary history, and who cannot be conveniently classed\r\nunder any other head. There are few better known names of the time than\r\nBernard Palissy. His famous enamels are no doubt partly the cause of\r\nthis, but other artists as great or greater are not nearly so living to\r\nus as this maker of pottery. He was born in or about 1510, at a village,\r\nChapelle Broin, near Agen, and he died in the Bastile, in 1589, a\r\nprisoner for his Protestantism. Catherine de Medicis had saved him from\r\nthe massacre of St. Bartholomew. His long life was occupied mainly in\r\nart and scientific researches, partly also in lecturing on natural\r\nhistory and physics, and in writing accounts of his investigations,\r\nwhich are not very voluminous, but which possess an extraordinary\r\nvividness of style and description. His treatise on pottery, the _Art de\r\nla Terre_, contains the passage which has become classical, describing\r\nhis desperate efforts to discover the secret of the Italian enamellers.\r\nHe also wrote a _Recepte veritable par laquelle tous les hommes de la\r\nFrance pourront apprendre a multiplier et a augmenter leurs Tresors_,\r\nand, some ten years before his death, a _Discours admirable de la Nature\r\ndes Eaux et Fontaines_. His literary work is an almost unique mixture of\r\nresearch with genuine literary fancy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pare.]\r\n\r\nAmbroise Pare, also a famous name, was born about the same time as\r\nPalissy, and died the year after him. A freethinker in his way, he\r\nescaped all temptation to embrace the dangerous heresy which was so\r\nfatal, or, at least, so inconvenient, to many other men of science and\r\nletters, and for the last forty years of his life he was court-surgeon.\r\nHis literary work is not inconsiderable in amount, consisting, as might\r\nbe expected, chiefly of professional treatises. The most interesting of\r\nhis books, however, from a general point of view, and, as it happens,\r\nalso by far the best written, is his _Apologie et Voyages_, a kind of\r\nautobiography which contains a large collection of anecdotes and\r\ndetails, not unimportant for the history of the time, as well as of much\r\npersonal interest. The style of this book is often vivid and\r\npicturesque, as well as clear and precise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Olivier de Serres.]\r\n\r\nIt was fitting that agriculture, which is the staple industry of France,\r\nshould contribute to her literature at this period--the most genuine and\r\nexuberant period of its history, if not that which produced the most\r\nminutely finished work. The _Theatre de l'Agriculture et du Menage des\r\nChamps_ of Olivier de Serres was published in the last year of the\r\ncentury. The author was a native of the town of Villeneuve du Berg, in\r\nthe present department of Ardeche. He was a Protestant and a great\r\nfavourite of Henri IV., to whom he was useful in developing Sully's\r\nplans of internal economy. The _Theatre de l'Agriculture_ was long the\r\nclassic book on the subject, and the author has been honoured, in quite\r\nrecent times, by statues and other demonstrations. Like most books of\r\nthe kind, it is much overlaid with erudition, but this only adds to its\r\npicturesqueness; and, as the author's precepts were founded on a life's\r\nexperience of his subject, it certainly cannot be reproached with a want\r\nof practical knowledge and aim.\r\n\r\nNot a few other authors would require notice, if space permitted, in\r\nthis class of scientific and erudite authors, particularly in the class\r\nof linguistics and literature. Such is Geoffroy Tory, a printer,\r\ngrammarian, and prose-writer of merit in the early part of the century,\r\nwho anticipated Rabelais in his protest against the indiscriminate\r\nLatinisation of the later Rhetoriqueurs. Not a few other writers, such\r\nas Pelletier and Fontaine, busied themselves during the period with\r\ngrammar and prosody; while towards the close of it, the first French\r\nbibliographers of eminence, La Croix du Maine, and Du Verdier, made\r\ntheir appearance. But the works of all these, as rather ancillary to\r\nliterature than actually literary, must here be passed over.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[209] Cauvin or Chauvin is the more correct form, but the Latinised\r\nCalvinus made Calvin more usual. Calvin's works are voluminous. The\r\n_Institution_ was published in convenient shape at Paris in 1859.\r\n\r\n[210] Most of Amyot is accessible only in the old editions. A beautiful\r\nedition of the _Daphnis and Chloe_ has been published by L. Glady.\r\nLondon, 1878.\r\n\r\n[211] Dolet's works are not easily to be found except in public\r\nlibraries. The standard book on him is that of Mr. R. C. Christie\r\n(London, 1880), one of the best monographs on French literary history to\r\nbe found in any language.\r\n\r\n[212] 2 vols. Paris, 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMONTAIGNE AND BRANTOME.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disenchantment of the late Renaissance.]\r\n\r\nA period of enthusiasm passes naturally and almost necessarily into one\r\nof scepticism, and it is in no way surprising that the prominent\r\nliterary figure of the second half of the sixteenth century in France\r\nshould have taken for his motto rather 'Que sais-je?' than, like\r\nRabelais, 'Sursum Corda.' The early hopes of the Renaissance had been\r\ncuriously disappointed. The Reformation had resulted not merely in cruel\r\nand destructive civil war, but in the formation, in too many cases, of a\r\nProtestantism not less imperious and far more illiberal than the\r\nCatholicism against which it protested. The economic and social effects\r\nof the discovery of the New World had been equally discouraging, and\r\neven the recovery of classical learning had produced a race of pedants\r\nalmost as trifling as the last doting defenders of scholasticism. The\r\nevils of the civil state of France, moreover, drove nearly all the best\r\nmen into the sect of _Politiques_, or Trimmers, who avowedly regarded\r\nhigh questions of truth and faith as subordinate to a politic\r\nopportunism. The age had not lost its power of enjoyment of affairs and\r\nof pleasure, but its appetite for higher things was somewhat blunted. In\r\nthis state of matters a few persons, of whom Montaigne was incomparably\r\nthe most important, philosophised sceptically about life, and a great\r\nmany, of whom Brantome is the most typical, took pleasure in describing\r\nthe ways and acts of an aristocracy which combined extraordinary luxury\r\nand corruption with great love of wit, singular intellectual ability,\r\nand a keen interest in war and business.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Montaigne.]\r\n\r\nMichel Eyquem, Sieur de Montaigne[213], was born, 'between eleven and\r\ntwelve o'clock of the day' (the detail is characteristic), on the 28th\r\nof February, 1533, at the _chateau_ from which he derived his name, and\r\nwhich he has made illustrious. Montaigne is situated in the old province\r\nof Perigord, or, according to modern nomenclature, in the department of\r\nDordogne and the arrondissement of Bergerac. It is at no great distance\r\nfrom Bordeaux. The family was long believed from a phrase of Montaigne's\r\nown to have been of English extraction, introduced during the long\r\ntenure of Aquitaine by our sovereigns. But recent and industrious\r\nresearches have shown that it may with greater probability have been of\r\nlocal origin and yeoman _status_. Pierre Eyquem, the father, had filled\r\nmany important municipal offices at Bordeaux. Michel was his third son\r\namong nine children, but by the death of his elder brothers he inherited\r\nthe family estate. He was educated early, and after the manner of a time\r\nwhen education was a subject on which almost all men of independent\r\nthought rode hobbies. Latin he learnt by conversation at a very early\r\nage, Greek as a kind of amusement. At the mature age of six he was\r\nplaced at the College de Guyenne in Bordeaux, not the least famous of\r\nthe famous schools of the time, for there it was that Buchanan, Muretus,\r\nand Guerente, by the Latin plays which they wrote for their scholars to\r\nact, introduced the Senecan drama into France and showed the way to the\r\nFrench tragedy of the Pleiade. Seven years of study completed\r\nMontaigne's school education at the age of thirteen, when nowadays boys\r\nquit their preparatory cradles. He was set to work at law, but little\r\npositive is known of him for many years. In 1554, being then twenty-one,\r\nhe was made counsellor in the Bordeaux _Parlement_, and in 1566 he\r\nmarried Francoise de la Chassaigne, daughter of one of his colleagues.\r\nExcept casual references in the _Essays_, which are seldom precise, all\r\nwe know of him during these years is his friendship with Etienne de la\r\nBoetie. He almost certainly served one or more campaigns; but the most\r\npositive thing that can be said of his middle life is that, according to\r\nan existing inscription of his own, he finally retired, in 1571, on his\r\nthirty-eighth birthday, to the _chateau_ which had become his by his\r\nfather's death two years previously. He had already translated the\r\n_Theologia Naturalis_ of Raymond de Sebonde. In the year of his\r\nretirement he edited the works of La Boetie. But he now began a much\r\nmore important task. The first two books of the _Essais_ appeared in\r\n1580; and immediately afterwards Montaigne, who suffered from severe\r\ninternal disorders, undertook a long journey into Italy, Switzerland,\r\nand Germany, which occupied nearly a year and a-half. While sojourning\r\nat the baths of Lucca, he received the news of his appointment as mayor\r\nof Bordeaux, and hastened home. In 1588 he published the third Book of\r\nthe _Essays_, and had troubles with the Leaguers in Paris. Four years\r\nafterwards, on the 13th September, 1592, he died of quinsy. Although\r\nMontaigne's municipal and legal appointments at Bordeaux are all that we\r\nknow him to have enjoyed, he is styled 'gentleman in ordinary to the\r\nking,' and letters extant from and to Charles IX., Henri III., and Henri\r\nIV., show him to have enjoyed a considerable social as well as literary\r\nposition. He was a knight of the Order of St. Michael. By his wife he\r\nhad several children, but all died young, except one daughter, who\r\nsurvived him and left offspring. His adopted daughter, however,\r\nMademoiselle de Gournay, a celebrated character of the next age, and the\r\nfirst editor of his complete works after his death, is better known.\r\n\r\nA complete abstract of Montaigne's work cannot be here attempted, and\r\nindeed no such thing is possible, because the work itself is absolutely\r\ndestitute of general plan and exhibits no unity but a unity of spirit\r\nand treatment. Whether Montaigne himself invented the famous title\r\n_Essays_ or not, is a matter of the very smallest importance. It is\r\ncertain that he was the first to give the word its modern meaning,\r\nthough he dealt with his subjects in a spirit of audacious\r\ndesultoriness, which many of his successors have endeavoured to imitate,\r\nbut which few have imitated successfully. His nominal subject is, as a\r\nrule, merely a starting-point, or at the most a text. He allows himself\r\nto be diverted from it by any game which crosses his path, and diverges\r\nas readily from his new direction. Abundant citation from the classics\r\nis one of his chief characteristics; but the two main points which\r\ndifferentiate him are, first, the audacious egotism and frankness with\r\nwhich he discourses of his private affairs and exhibits himself in\r\nundress; secondly, the flavour of subtle scepticism which he diffuses\r\nover his whole work. Both these are susceptible of a good deal of\r\nmisconstruction, and both no doubt have been a good deal misconstrued.\r\nHis egotism, like most egotism, is a compound of frankness and\r\naffectation, and its sincerity is not, as an attraction, equal to the\r\neasy garrulity for which it affords an occasion of display. His\r\nscepticism, however, is altogether _sui generis_. It is not exuberant,\r\nlike that of Rabelais, nor sneering, like that of Voltaire, nor\r\ndespairing, like that of Pascal, nor merely inquisitive and scholarly,\r\nlike that of Bayle. There is no reason for disbelieving Montaigne's\r\nsincere and conscious orthodoxy in the ecclesiastical sense. But his own\r\ntemperament, assisted no doubt by the political and ecclesiastical\r\ncircumstances already described, by indifferent bodily health, and by\r\nthe period, if not exactly of excess, at any rate of free living, in his\r\nyounger days, to which he so constantly alludes, had produced in him a\r\ngeneral feeling that the _pros_ and _cons_ of different opinions and\r\nactions balance each other more evenly than is generally thought. He\r\nlooks on life with a kind of ironical enjoyment, and the three books of\r\nhis _Essays_ might be described as a vast gallery of pictures\r\nillustrating the results of his contemplations.\r\n\r\nThere are some considerable differences between the earlier and later\r\n_Essays_, one of the most obvious of which concerns the point of length.\r\nThus the first book consists of fifty-seven essays, occupying rather\r\nmore than 500 pages[214], or an average of less than ten pages each. The\r\nsecond (exclusive of the long 'Apologie de Raymond Sebonde,' which\r\noccupies 300 pages by itself) contains thirty-six essays, of nearly 500\r\npages in all, or about twelve pages each. These books were published\r\ntogether, and may be presumed to have been written more or less at the\r\nsame time. But the third and last book, though it contains full 550\r\npages, has only thirteen essays, which thus average more than forty\r\npages each, though their length is very unequal. Montaigne had, no\r\ndoubt, found that his pillar-to-post method of discourse was\r\nsufficiently attractive to make fresh starting-points and definite\r\ntitles unnecessary; thus in the third book, his subjects (at least his\r\nprofessed subjects) are sometimes much wider, and sometimes much more\r\nwhimsical, than in the two first. Oedipus himself could hardly divine\r\nthe actual subject of the essay 'Sur des Vers de Virgile,' or guess that\r\na paper 'Sur les Coches' would in reality busy itself with the question\r\nwhat virtues are most proper to a sovereign. On the other hand, such\r\nlarge titles as 'De la Vanite de l'Experience,' etc. give room for\r\nalmost any and every excursion. All these are in the last book; the\r\nshorter essays of the two first for the most part deal more definitely\r\nwith their nominal subjects, which are most frequently moral brocards:\r\nsuch as 'Le Profit de l'Un est Dommage de l'Autre,' 'Par Divers Moyens\r\non arrive a Pareille Fin,' etc.\r\n\r\nIn a literary history, however, of the scale and plan of this present,\r\nthe question of Montaigne's subjects and sentiments, interesting as it\r\nis, must not be allowed to obscure the question of the expression which\r\nhe gave to these sentiments. His book is of the greatest importance in\r\nthe history of French style, of an importance indeed which has been by\r\nno means invariably recognised by French literary historians themselves.\r\nIt must be remembered that he at once attained, and never lost, an\r\nimmense popularity. Thus the comparative oblivion which, owing to the\r\nreforms of the early seventeenth century and the brilliant period of\r\nproduction which followed them, overtook most of the men of the\r\nRenaissance, did not touch Montaigne. He, with Rabelais, remained a well\r\nof undefiled French, which all the artificial filtering of Malherbe and\r\nBoileau could not deprive of its refreshing and fertilising power.\r\nWriting, too, at a period subsequent, instead of anterior to the\r\ninnovations of the Pleiade, Montaigne was able to incorporate, and thus\r\nto save, not a few of the neologisms which, valuable as they were, the\r\npurists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries neglected. Many\r\nwords which his immediate contemporaries, and still more his successors,\r\ncondemned, have made good their footing in the language, owing beyond\r\nall doubt to his influence. His style, too, was valuable for something\r\nelse besides its vocabulary. It entered so seldom into the plan of\r\nRabelais to write in any other than a burlesque tone, that he was rarely\r\nable to display his own incomparable faculty of writing ordinary French,\r\npure, vigorous, graceful, and flexible at once. The tale-tellers and\r\nmemoir-writers of the time matured an excellent narrative style, but one\r\nless suited for other forms of writing. The theologians often obeyed the\r\nLatinising influence too implicitly. But Montaigne, with his wide\r\nvariety of subject, required and wrought out for himself a corresponding\r\nvariety of style. His very discursiveness and the constant flow of new\r\nthoughts that welled up in him helped him to avoid the great curse of\r\nall the vulgar tongues in the Renaissance--the long jointed sentence;\r\nthe easy colloquial manner at which he aimed reflected itself in a style\r\nless familiar indeed than avowed burlesque, but at the same time more\r\nfamiliar than any writer had before used in treating of similar\r\nsubjects. Yet no one was more capable than Montaigne, on the rare\r\noccasions when he judged it proper, of showing his mastery of sustained\r\nand lofty eloquence. The often-quoted passage in which he rebukes the\r\nvanity of man (who, without letters patent or privilege, assumes to\r\nhimself the honour of being the only created being cognisant of the\r\nsecret of the universe) yields to nothing that had been written or was\r\nto be written for many years, fertile as the sixteenth and early\r\nseventeenth centuries were in both its characteristics, solemnity and\r\ndignity of expression. That a book which was thus rich in vocabulary,\r\nricher still in idiosyncrasy of expression, gracefully familiar in\r\ngeneral style, and admirably eloquent in occasional passages, should at\r\nonce become popular, and should remain so, could not be without a happy\r\neffect on the general standard of literary taste and the general\r\nacquaintance with the capabilities of the French language. That\r\nMontaigne himself was a sound critical judge and not merely a lucky\r\npractitioner of style, may be judged from his singling out Amyot as the\r\ngreat master of it among his own immediate predecessors. In so far,\r\nindeed, as prose style goes, master and scholar must undoubtedly take\r\nrank at the head of all the writers of the century when bulk and variety\r\nof examples are taken into account.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charron.]\r\n\r\nAlthough, as has been already noted, Montaigne has many sides, his most\r\nstriking peculiarity may be said to be the mixture of philosophical\r\nspeculation, especially on ethical and political topics, with attention\r\nto the historical side of human life both in the past and in the\r\npresent. He was, however, by no means the only teacher of ethics and\r\npolitical philosophy in his century. His own mantle was taken up, or\r\nattempted to be taken up, by Pierre Charron[215]. Born at Paris in 1541,\r\nhe was thoroughly educated; studied law, in which he proceeded to a\r\ndoctor's degree, and was called to the Paris bar, but then suddenly\r\nentered the Church, and became renowned as a preacher. He even thought\r\nof embracing the monastic life--a waste of ability which the\r\necclesiastical authorities, conscious of their need of eloquent\r\nadvocates, did not permit. Charron belonged rather to the moderate or\r\n_politique_ party than to the fanatics of Catholicism, and he directly\r\nattacked the League in his _Discours Chretiens_, published in 1589. Five\r\nyears later appeared a regular theological treatise entitled _Les Trois\r\nVerites_, affirming, first, the unity of God, and consequently of\r\northodox religion; secondly, the sole authority of Christianity among\r\nreligions; thirdly, the sole authority of Catholicism among Christian\r\nchurches and sects. He held various preferments, and was a member of the\r\nspecial synod held to admit Henri IV. to the Roman communion. The only\r\nwork by which he is generally remembered, the treatise _De la Sagesse_,\r\nwas published in 1601. Charron died two years later, after preparing a\r\nsecond and somewhat altered edition of the book. Charron was a personal\r\nfriend of Montaigne, was undoubtedly his disciple, and borrowed largely,\r\nand in many cases verbally, from the _Essais_. His book, however, is far\r\ninferior both in style and matter to his master's, and Pope's praise of\r\n'more wise Charron' can be due only to the fact that it is much more\r\ndefinitely sceptical. In curious contrast to its author's dogmatically\r\ntheological treatise, _De la Sagesse_ goes to prove that all religions\r\nare more or less of human origin, and that they are all indebted one to\r\nthe other. The casuistry of the Renaissance on these points was,\r\nhowever, peculiar; and it has been supposed, with great show of reason,\r\nthat Charron regarded orthodoxy as a valuable and necessary condition\r\nfor the common run of men, while the elect would prefer a refined\r\nAgnosticism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Du Vair.]\r\n\r\nThese sceptical opinions were by no means the invention of Montaigne;\r\nthey were part of the new learning grafted by the study of the classics\r\non the thought of the middle ages, and had been long anticipated, not\r\nmerely in Italy but in France itself. The poet and tale-teller,\r\nBonaventure des Periers, had, as has been said, almost directly\r\nsatirised Christianity in the _Cymbalum Mundi_, which created so great a\r\nscandal. On the other hand, Guillaume du Vair, a lawyer and speaker of\r\neminence, sought, by combining Stoicism and Christianity, to oppose this\r\nsceptical tendency. Du Vair was a writer of great merit, who exactly\r\nreversed the course of Charron, beginning with theology and ending with\r\nlaw, though he died in double harness, as keeper of the Seals and bishop\r\nof Lisieux. His moral works[216] were numerous: _Sainte Philosophie_,\r\n_De la Philosophie des Stoiques_, _De la Constance et Consolation des\r\nCalamites Publiques_. He translated, not merely Epictetus, which may be\r\nregarded as part of his ethical work, but numerous speeches of the Greek\r\nand Latin orators. He was himself a great speaker, and his best work is\r\nhis _Discours sur la Loi Salique_, which contributed powerfully to the\r\noverthrow of the project for recognising the Infanta as Queen of France.\r\nHe also wrote a regular treatise on French oratory. The style of Du Vair\r\nis modelled with some closeness on his classical patterns, but without\r\nany trace of pedantry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bodin and other Political Writers.]\r\n\r\nA greater name than Du Vair's in purely philosophical politics is that\r\nof Jean Bodin[217], the author of the only work of great excellence on\r\nthe science of politics before the eighteenth century. Bodin was born at\r\nAngers in 1530, became a lawyer, was king's procureur at Laon, and died\r\nthere in 1596. His great work, entitled after Plato _La Republique_,\r\nappeared in 1578. It was first published in French, but afterwards\r\nenlarged and reissued by the author in Latin. Bodin follows both Plato\r\nand Aristotle to some extent, but especially Aristotle, in his approach\r\nand treatment of his subject. But, unlike his masters, Bodin declares\r\nfor absolute monarchy, of course wisely and temperately administered.\r\nThe general literary sentiment was perhaps the other way. The affection\r\nof Montaigne, and a certain fertility of rhetorical commonplace which\r\nhas always seduced Frenchmen in political matters, have given undue\r\nreputation to the _Contre-un_ or _Discours de la Servitude volontaire_\r\nof Etienne de la Boetie[218]. In reality it is but a schoolboy theme,\r\nrecalling the silly chatter about Harmodius and Brutus which was popular\r\nat the time of the Revolution. Many other political works were published\r\nin the course of the religious wars, but having been for the most part\r\nwritten in Latin, or translated by others than their authors, they do\r\nnot concern us. The excellent Michel de l'Hospital, however, published\r\nmany speeches, letters, and pamphlets on the side of conciliation, for\r\nthe most part better intended than written; and the famous Protestants\r\nLa Noue and Duplessis-Mornay were frequent writers on political\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brantome.]\r\n\r\nThe complement and counterpart of this moralising on human business and\r\npleasure is necessarily to be found in chronicles of that business and\r\nthat pleasure as actually pursued. In these the sixteenth century is\r\nextraordinarily rich. Correspondence had hardly yet attained the\r\nimportance in French literature which it afterwards acquired, but\r\nprofessed history and, still more, personal memoirs were largely\r\nwritten. The name of Brantome[219] has been chosen as the central and\r\nrepresentative name of this section of writers, because he is on the\r\nwhole the most original and certainly the most famous of them. His work,\r\nmoreover, has more than one point of resemblance to that of the great\r\ncontemporary author with whom he is linked at the head of this chapter.\r\nBrantome neither wrote actual history nor directly personal memoirs. His\r\nwork rather consists of desultory biographical essays, forming a curious\r\npendant to the desultory moral essays of Montaigne. But around him rank\r\nmany writers, some historians pure and simple, some memoir-writers pure\r\nand simple, of whom not a few approach him in literary genius, and\r\nsurpass him in correctness and finish of style, while almost all exceed\r\nhim in whatever advantage may be derived from uniformity of plan, and\r\nfrom regard to the decencies of literature.\r\n\r\nPierre de Bourdeilles (who derived the name by which he is, and indeed\r\nwas during his lifetime, generally known from an abbacy given to him by\r\nHenri II. when he was still a boy) was born about 1540, in the province\r\nof Perigord, but the exact date and place of his birth have not been\r\nascertained. He was the third son of Francois, Comte de Bourdeilles, and\r\nhis mother, Anne de Vivonne de la Chataigneraie, was the sister of the\r\nfamous duellist whose encounter with Jarnac his nephew has described in\r\na well-known passage. In the court of Marguerite d'Angouleme, the\r\nliterary nursery of so great a part of the talent of France at this\r\ntime, he passed his early youth, went to school at Paris and at\r\nPoitiers, and was made Abbe de Brantome at the age of sixteen. He was\r\nthus sufficiently provided for, and he never took any orders, but was a\r\ncourtier and a soldier throughout the whole of his active life. Indeed\r\nalmost the first use he made of his benefice was to equip himself and a\r\nrespectable suite for a journey into Italy, where he served under the\r\nMarechal de Brissac. He accompanied Mary Stuart to Scotland, served in\r\nthe Spanish army in Africa, volunteered for the relief of Malta from the\r\nTurks, and again for the expedition destined to assist Hungary against\r\nSoliman, and in other ways led the life of a knight-errant. The\r\nreligious wars in his own country gave him plenty of employment; but in\r\nthe reigns of Charles IX. and Henri III. he was more particularly\r\nattached to the suite of the queen dowager and her daughter Marguerite.\r\nHe was, however, somewhat disappointed in his hopes of recompense; and\r\nafter hesitating for a time between the Royalists, the Leaguers, and the\r\nSpaniards, he left the court, retired into private life, and began to\r\nwrite his memoirs, partly in consequence of a severe accident. He seems\r\nto have begun to write about 1594, and he lived for twenty years longer,\r\ndying on the 15th of July, 1614.\r\n\r\nThe form of Brantome's works is, as has been said, peculiar. They are\r\nusually divided into two parts, dealing respectively with men and women.\r\nThe first part in its turn consists of many sub-divisions, the chief of\r\nwhich is made up of the _Vies des Grands Capitaines Etrangers et\r\nFrancais_, while others consist of separate disquisitions or essays,\r\n_Des Rodomontades Espagnoles_, 'On some Duels and Challenges in France'\r\nand elsewhere, 'On certain Retreats, and how they are sometimes better\r\nthan Battles,' etc. Of the part which is devoted to women the chief\r\nportion is the celebrated _Dames Galantes_, which is preceded by a\r\nseries of _Vies des Dames Illustres_, matching the _Grands Capitaines_.\r\nThe _Dames Galantes_ is subdivided into eight discourses, with titles\r\nwhich smack of Montaigne, as thus, 'Qu'il n'est bien seant de parler mal\r\ndes honnestes dames bien qu'elles fassent l'amour,' 'Scavoir qui est\r\nplus belle chose en amour,' etc. These discourses are, however, in\r\nreality little but a congeries of anecdotes, often scandalous enough.\r\nBesides these, his principal works, Brantome left divers _Opuscula_,\r\nsome of which are definitely literary, dealing chiefly with Lucan. None\r\nof his works were published in his lifetime, nor did any appear in print\r\nuntil 1659. Meanwhile manuscript copies had, as usual, been multiplied,\r\nwith the result, also usual, that the text was much falsified and\r\nmutilated.\r\n\r\nThe great merit of Brantome lies in the extraordinary vividness of his\r\npowers of literary presentment. His style is careless, though it is\r\nprobable that the carelessness is not unstudied. But his irregular,\r\nbrightly coloured, and easily flowing manner represents, as hardly any\r\nage has ever been represented, the characteristics of the great society\r\nof his time. It is needless to say that the morals of that time were\r\nutterly corrupt, but Brantome accepts them with a placid complacency\r\nwhich is almost innocent. No writer, perhaps, has ever put things more\r\ndisgraceful on paper; but no writer has ever written of such things in\r\nsuch a perfectly natural manner. Brantome was in his way a\r\nhero-worshipper, though his heroes and heroines were sometimes oddly\r\ncoupled. Bayard and Marguerite de Valois represent his ideals, and a\r\ngood knight or a beautiful lady _de par le monde_ can do no wrong. This\r\nunquestioning acceptance of, and belief in, the moral standards of his\r\nown society, give a genuineness and a freshness to his work which are\r\nvery rare in literature. Few writers, again, have had the knack of\r\nhitting off character, superficially it is true, yet with sufficient\r\ndistinction, which Brantome has. There is something individual about all\r\nthe innumerable characters who move across his stage, and something\r\nthoroughly human about all, even the anonymous men and women, who appear\r\nfor a moment as the actors in some too frequently discreditable scene.\r\nWith all this there is a considerable vein of moralising in Brantome\r\nwhich serves to throw up the relief of his actual narratives. He has\r\nsometimes been compared to Pepys, but, except in point of garrulity and\r\nof readiness to set down on paper anything that came into their heads,\r\nthere is little likeness between the two. Brantome was emphatically an\r\n_ecrivain_ (unscholarly and Italianised as his phrase sometimes appears,\r\nif judged by the standards of a severer age), and some of the best\r\npassages from his works are among the most striking examples of French\r\nprose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Montluc.]\r\n\r\nNext to Brantome, and in some respects above him, though of a somewhat\r\nless remarkable idiosyncrasy, come Montluc, La Noue, and D'Aubigne, with\r\nMarguerite de Valois not far behind. Blaise de Lasseran-Massencome,\r\nSeigneur de Montluc[220], was a typical _cadet de Gascogne_, though he\r\nwas not, strictly speaking, a cadet, being the eldest son of a\r\nfortuneless house. He became page to Antoine of Lorraine, and made his\r\nfirst campaign under the orders of Bayard, fighting through the whole of\r\nthe Italian war, and being knighted on the field at Cerisoles. In the\r\nnext reign he was promoted to high command, and held Sienna against the\r\nImperialists with distinguished gallantry and skill. When the civil war\r\nbroke out he was made Governor of Guyenne, where he maintained order\r\nwith the strong hand, 'heading and hanging' Catholics and Protestants\r\nalike, if they showed signs of disloyalty. Ruthless as he was, he was\r\none of the few great officers who refused to participate in the massacre\r\nof St. Bartholomew. He was made a marshal in 1574, and died three years\r\nlater. Montluc's Memoirs are purely military, and the most famous\r\ndescription of them is that of Henri IV., who called them the soldier's\r\nBible. His style is concise, free from the slightest attempt at\r\nelaborate ornament, but admirably picturesque and clear. His account of\r\nhis exploit at Sienna is one of the capital chapters of French military\r\nhistory. But almost any page of Montluc possesses eminently the\r\ncharacteristics which great generals from Caesar downwards have almost\r\nuniformly displayed, when they possess any literary talent at all. The\r\nwords and sentences are marshalled and managed like an army; everything\r\ngoes straight to the point; there is no confusion, and the whole\r\ncomplicated scene is as clear as a geometrical diagram.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: La Noue.]\r\n\r\nThe Memoirs of La Noue are usually spoken of separately, though in\r\nreality they form a part of his _Discours Politiques et Militaires_.\r\nFrancois de la Noue, called Bras-de-Fer (a surname which he deserved not\r\nmetaphorically, but literally, having had to replace one of his arms\r\nshot off during a siege), was a Breton, and of a good family. He was\r\nborn in 1531, fought through the religious wars, escaped St. Bartholomew\r\nby being Alva's prisoner in Flanders, took an active part against the\r\nLeague, and died at the siege of Lamballe, Aug. 4, 1591. His defence of\r\nLa Rochelle was one of the chief of his many feats of arms. The\r\n'Discourses' were published during his life. They are of a more\r\nreflective character than those of Montluc, and display much greater\r\nmental cultivation. The style is not quite so vivid, the sentences are\r\nlonger and more charged with thought. La Noue, in short, is a\r\nphilosophical soldier and a politician. His style is perhaps less\r\narchaic than that of any of his contemporaries, and is distinguished by\r\na remarkable strength, sobriety, and precision. He was very highly\r\nthought of by both political parties, and was not unfrequently employed\r\nin schemes of mediation. It is a pleasant story, and not irrelevant in a\r\nhistory of literature, that a scheme for his assassination during one of\r\nhis visits to Paris was discovered by Brantome, who warned his future\r\ncraftsfellow of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Agrippa d'Aubigne.]\r\n\r\nAgrippa d'Aubigne belongs to this section of the subject by his _Vie a\r\nses Enfants_, often called his memoirs, by his _Histoire Universelle_,\r\nand by a great number of letters. The same qualities which distinguish\r\nD'Aubigne in verse are recognisable in his prose, his passionate and\r\ninsubordinate temper, the keenness of his satire, the somewhat turbid\r\ngrandeur of his style and images, the vigour and picturesqueness of\r\noccasional traits. The _Histoire Universelle_ and the _Vie a ses\r\nEnfants_ were both works written in old age, but there is hardly any\r\nsign of failing power in them. The _Vie_ in particular contains many\r\npassages, such as the vision of his mother and the passionate charge\r\nwhich his father laid upon him at the sight of the victims of the\r\nAmboise conspiracy, which rank very high among the prose of the century.\r\nThe _Histoire Universelle_, like the book which Raleigh wrote almost at\r\nthe same time, and under not dissimilar circumstances, is necessarily in\r\ngreat part a compilation, but has many passages worthy of its author at\r\nhis best.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marguerite de Valois.]\r\n\r\nThe Memoirs of Marguerite de Valois contain what is perhaps the\r\nbest-known and oftenest quoted passage of any memoirs of the time, that\r\nin which the Princess describes the night of St. Bartholomew. There are\r\nnot many such stirring passages in them, but throughout Marguerite gives\r\nevidence of the remarkable talent which distinguished the Valois. Her\r\nevident object is to justify herself, and this makes the book somewhat\r\nartificial. It is dedicated to Brantome, but shows in its manner rather\r\nthe influence of Ronsard and the Pleiade by the classical correctness of\r\nthe style, the absence of archaisms, and the precision and form of the\r\nsentences. According to the principles of the school, the vocabulary is\r\nsimple and vernacular enough, for the Pleiade regarded ornate\r\nclassicisms of language as proper to poetry.\r\n\r\nIn a rank not much below those mentioned must be placed the so-called\r\n_Memoires de Vieilleville_, the _Chronologies_ of Palma-Cayet, the\r\n_Registres-Journaux_ of Pierre de l'Estoile, the Letters of\r\nDuplessis-Mornay, Cardinal d'Ossat, and Henri IV. himself, and the\r\n_Negotiations_ of the President Jeannin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vieilleville.]\r\n\r\nThe Marechal de Vieilleville was one of the foremost French generals of\r\nthe sixteenth century, and, considering the violent and unscrupulous\r\nways of the time, he had a good reputation for moderation, probity, and\r\npatriotism, as well as for courage and ability. His Memoirs are not his\r\nown work, but that of his secretary and lifelong companion, Vincent\r\nCarloix. They have some of the defects of a deliberate panegyric; but\r\nCarloix is a vigorous and able writer, who, without completely\r\nemancipating himself from the tyranny of the long involved sentence,\r\ncontrives to write clearly, and often with much picturesque effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Palma-Cayet.]\r\n\r\nPierre Victor Palma-Cayet was of mean extraction, but received a good\r\neducation, and was introduced by La Noue to Jeanne d'Albret as a\r\nsuitable assistant-tutor for her son. After the accession of his pupil,\r\nhe was appointed to various offices, one of which, that of Chronologer\r\nRoyal, no doubt occasioned the odd titles of his two principal works,\r\n_Chronologie Novenaire_ and _Chronologie Septenaire_, which give the\r\nhistory of Henri's reign, dividing it into two portions, the one of nine\r\nyears, the other of seven. Cayet also wrote several minor works, and\r\ndivides with D'Aubigne the doubtful honour of being the author of the\r\n_Divorce Satirique_, a scurrilous pamphlet against Marguerite. The\r\n_Chronologies_ are extremely full of matter, and admirably precise in\r\ntheir information, but their literary value is not great.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pierre de l'Estoile.]\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view Pierre de l'Estoile[221] is of a higher class.\r\nHe was a lawyer of rank and an indefatigable writer. Day by day he put\r\ndown in his _Tablettes_ all sorts of public and private affairs, as well\r\nas literary extracts, obituary notices, and, in short, almost the entire\r\nmaterial of a modern newspaper. Pierre de l'Estoile, much more than\r\nBrantome, is the French Pepys. Although occasionally prejudiced, the\r\nwriter seems to have been acute and well-informed, and his manner of\r\ndealing with his heterogeneous materials is light and lively.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D'Ossat.]\r\n\r\nOf the three correspondence-writers just mentioned, though Henri himself\r\nis a vigorous and fertile writer, the most important by far is Cardinal\r\nD'Ossat. He was born in the south of France in 1536, and had not, unlike\r\nmany of the diplomatist ecclesiastics of the period, the advantage of\r\nhigh birth. Like many of his contemporaries, he began as a lawyer and\r\nonly subsequently took orders. He began diplomatic life as Secretary to\r\nthe Archbishop of Toulouse, who was ambassador at Rome, and later on\r\nconducted the negotiations which led to the conversion of Henri IV. He\r\nthen became Bishop of Rennes and cardinal. His letters are almost\r\nentirely devoted to subjects connected with his profession, and have\r\nalways held a position as one of the earliest models of diplomatic\r\nwriting. D'Ossat's style, especially in respect of its vocabulary, was\r\nlong regarded as a pattern, but it has less character than that of some\r\nother sixteenth-century writers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sully.]\r\n\r\nThe last two books to be named belong, in point of date, to the next\r\ncentury, but were written by, or for, men who were emphatically of the\r\nsixteenth. The extraordinary form of Sully's Memoirs is well known. They\r\nare neither written as if by himself, nor of him as by a historian of\r\nthe usual kind. They are directly addressed to the hero in the form of\r\nan elaborate reminder of his own actions. 'You then said this;' 'his\r\nMajesty thereupon sent you there;' 'when you were two leagues from your\r\nhalting-place, you saw a courier coming,' etc. It is needless to say\r\nthat this manner of telling history is in the highest degree unnatural\r\nand heavy, and, after the first quaintness of it wears off, it makes the\r\nbook very hard to read. It contains, however, a very large number of\r\nshort memoirs and documents of all kinds, in which the elaborate farce\r\nof 'Vous' is perforce abandoned. It shows Sully as he was--a great and\r\nskilful statesman: but it does not give a pleasant idea of his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jeannin.]\r\n\r\nPierre Jeannin was, like D'Ossat, a diplomatist in the service of Henri\r\nIV. He had previously discharged many legal functions of importance, and\r\nsubsequently he was Controller-General of the Finances. His\r\n_Negotiations_ contain the record of his proceedings on a mission to the\r\nNetherlands to watch over the interests of France. The book consists of\r\nletters, despatches, treaties, and such-like documents, very clear,\r\nprecise, and written in a remarkably simple and natural style.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Memoir-writers.]\r\n\r\nThere were many other writers of memoirs during the period, most of\r\nwhose works are comprised in the invaluable collections of Petitot,\r\nMichaud, Poujoulat, and Buchon. But few of them require a separate\r\nmention here. Guillaume and Martin du Bellay, two brothers, have left a\r\nhistory of Francis I.'s reign, of which the part belonging to Guillaume\r\nis only a small fragment of an immense work which he entitled _Les\r\nOgdoades_, it being divided into seven batches of eight books each. The\r\nimitation of the classics is obvious, and the constant intrusion of\r\nclassical parallels rather tedious. The Memoirs of the Duke of Guise,\r\ncomposed in great part of what we should call his secretary's\r\nletter-book, are very voluminous, but not of much literary value.\r\nFrancois de Rabutin, author of _Commentaires des Guerres de la Gaule\r\nBelgique_, has the fault, common to his time, of enormous sentences, but\r\nis often lively and picturesque enough, as becomes a member of the\r\nfamily of Madame de Sevigne and of Bussy-Rabutin. The famous Marshal de\r\nTavannes, on whom more than on any single man rests the blood of St.\r\nBartholomew's Day, found a biographer in his son Jean de Tavannes, whose\r\nwork, though somewhat too elaborate, is interesting. Another son,\r\nGuillaume de Saulx-Tavannes, has written his own memoirs on a smaller\r\nscale. The memoirs of Michel de Castelnau show more of the tradition of\r\nComines than most of their contemporaries, and are remarkably full of\r\npolitical studies. Boyvin du Villars, of whom little is known, left\r\nvoluminous memoirs which have some literary merit. The last book of\r\nmemoirs of some size which needs to be mentioned, is that of Nicholas de\r\nNeufville, Seigneur de Villeroy, a politician of eminence and a vigorous\r\nwriter. Some short pieces may be noticed, such as the Siege of Metz, by\r\nBertrand de Salignac, that of St. Quentin, by Coligny himself, the only\r\nliterary monument of the Admiral (an excellent specimen of the military\r\nwriting of the time), and a very curious history of Annonay in the\r\nVivarais by Achille Gamon, which gives perhaps the liveliest idea\r\nobtainable of the sufferings of the French provincial towns during the\r\nreligious wars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Historians.]\r\n\r\nThe general histories, which make up a second class of historical\r\nwritings, are, as a rule, of very much less value than these personal\r\nmemoirs. Not till the extreme end of the period did the historical\r\nconception take a firm hold in De Thou, and the _Thuana_ was written in\r\nLatin, which excludes it and its author from detailed notice here.\r\nD'Aubigne's _Histoire Universelle_ of his own time has been mentioned\r\nfor convenience' sake already. Lancelot de la Popeliniere attempted in\r\nthe last quarter of the century a general history of France, and\r\nincidentally of Europe during his own day. He is said to have spent all\r\nhis fortune on getting together the materials, but his literary powers\r\nwere small. About the same time Bernard Girard, Seigneur du Haillan,\r\npublished a history of France from the earliest times, which an extract\r\nof Thierry's, giving the speeches of Charamond and Quadrek, Merovingians\r\nof Du Haillan's own creation, who speak on the advantages of different\r\nforms of government at the election of Pharamond, has made known to many\r\npersons who never saw the original. The source of this grotesque\r\nimagination is of course obvious to readers of Herodotus, and similar\r\nimitation of classical models is frequent in Du Haillan's work. Francois\r\nde Belleforest also wrote a general history of France, which was long\r\nread, and the names of Du Tillet, Jean de Serres, Charron, Dupleix, etc.\r\nmay be mentioned. But they represent writers of little importance,\r\neither from the point of view of history, or from that of literature.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[213] The standard edition until recently has been that of Le Clerc (4\r\nvols. Paris, 1866). That of Louandre in the Bibliotheque Charpentier is\r\nhandy and useful. MM. Courbet and Roger have begun a handsome edition.\r\n\r\n[214] The references are to the edition of Louandre.\r\n\r\n[215] _De la Sagesse._ 2 vols.

The Societe de l'Histoire de\r\nFrance has a voluminous edition on hand. Merimee, who was a great\r\nadmirer of Brantome, began an edition for the Bibliotheque Elzevirienne,\r\nbut left it unfinished.\r\n\r\n[220] Montluc's _Memoirs_, as well as most of those mentioned below,\r\nwill be found in the collection of Michaud and Poujoulat.\r\n\r\n[221] The earlier editions of this writer are not complete. In 1875 a\r\nfull reprint was begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE _SATYRE MENIPPEE_. REGNIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Satyre Menippee.]\r\n\r\nThe period of the Renaissance in France closed with two works (one for\r\nthe most part in prose and due to various authors, the other wholly in\r\nverse and the work of one only) which exhibit the highest excellence.\r\nThe _Satyre Menippee_ and the satires of Regnier are separated in point\r\nof date of publication by some fifteen years, and the contributors to\r\nthe first-named work belong for the most part to an earlier generation,\r\nand represent a less accomplished state of the language than the great\r\nsatirist who, after fifteen centuries, took up the traditions of his\r\nRoman masters. But both are satirical in substance, though the\r\n_Menippee_ is almost wholly political, and Regnier busies himself with\r\nsocial and moral subjects only. Both possess in a high degree the\r\ncharacteristics of the period which they close. Both exhibit a\r\nremarkable power of treating ephemeral subjects in a manner calculated\r\nto make their interest something more than ephemeral. Both have met with\r\nthe just reward of continuing to be popular even at times when the most\r\nunjust unpopularity rested on work scarcely less excellent but less\r\ncalculated to please the taste of those who, however much they may\r\nsympathise with the fashions of their own day, are unable to sympathise\r\nwith those of a day which is not theirs.\r\n\r\nThe _Satyre Menippee_[222] was a remarkable, and, for those who take an\r\ninterest both in literature and in politics, a most encouraging instance\r\nof the power of literary treatment at certain crises of political\r\nmatters. It appeared in 1594, at the crucial period of the League. For\r\nyears there had existed the party known for the most part\r\nuncomplimentarily as _Les Politiques_. These persons professed\r\nthemselves unable to find, in the simple difference of Catholic _v._\r\nProtestant, a _casus belli_ for Frenchmen against Frenchmen. Their\r\ninfluence, however, though it occasionally rose to the surface in the\r\ndays of Charles IX. and Henri III., had never been lasting, and they\r\nlaboured under the charge of being Laodiceans, trimmers, men who cared\r\nfor nothing but hollow peace and material prosperity. The assassination\r\nof Henri III., and the open confederation between the Leaguers and the\r\nSpanish party, at last gave them their opportunity, and it was seized\r\nwith an adroitness which would have been remarkable in a single man, but\r\nwhich is still more remarkable in a group of men of very different\r\nantecedents, professions, ages, and beliefs. The _Satyre Menippee_ is,\r\nin fact, the first and most admirable example of the theory of the\r\nmodern newspaper--the theory that the combined ability of many men is\r\nlikely, on the whole, to treat complicated and ephemeral affairs better\r\nthan the limited, though perhaps individually greater, ability of any\r\none man. The _Menippee_, prose and verse, was due to the working of a\r\nnew Pleiade--Leroy, Gillot, Passerat, Rapin, Chrestien, Pithou, and\r\nDurant. Most of them were lawyers, a few were more or less connected\r\nwith the Church. Pierre Leroy, a canon of Rouen, of whom nothing is\r\nknown, but whose character De Thou praises, is said to have planned the\r\nbook, and to have acted in some way as editor. Jacques Gillot,\r\nclerk-advocate of the Parliament, received the literary conspirators in\r\nhis house. Passerat and Rapin represented the mixed classical and French\r\nculture of the immediate companions of Ronsard. Florent Chrestien was a\r\nconverted Huguenot, much given to translation of ancient authors. Pithou\r\n(the writer of the harangue of Claude d'Aubray, the most important piece\r\nof the whole and containing the moral and idea of the book) was, like\r\nChrestien, a convert. He ranks as one of the most distinguished members\r\nof the French bar, and had a deserved reputation for every kind of\r\nlearning in his time. Lastly, Durant, who contributed rather to the\r\nappendix of the book than to the book itself, was an Auvergnat\r\ngentleman, who preferred poetry to law, and justified his preference by\r\nsome capital work, partly of a satirical kind, partly of an elegant and\r\ntender gallantry, anticipating, as has been justly said, the eighteenth\r\ncentury in elegance, and excelling it in tenderness.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the _Menippee_ (the title of which, it is hardly necessary\r\nto say, is borrowed from the name of the cynic philosopher celebrated by\r\nLucian) is for the time singularly original and bold; but the spirit in\r\nwhich the subject is treated is more original still. Generally speaking,\r\nthe piece has the form of a _compte-rendu_ of the assembly of the states\r\nat Paris. The full title is _De la Vertu du Catholicon d'Espagne et de\r\nla Tenue des Etats de Paris_. The preface contains a sarcastic harangue\r\nin orthodox charlatan style on the merits of the new Catholicon or\r\nPanacea. Then comes a description (in which, as throughout the work,\r\nactual facts are blended inextricably with satirical comment) of the\r\nopening procession. To this succeeds a sketch of the tapestries with\r\nwhich the hall of meeting was hung, all of which are, of course,\r\nallegorical, and deal with murders of princes, betrayal of native\r\ncountries to foreigners, etc. Next comes _L'Ordre tenu pour les\r\nSeances_, in which the chief personages on the side of the League are\r\nenumerated in a long catalogue, every item of which contains some bitter\r\nallusion to the private or public conduct of the person named. Seven\r\nsolemn speeches are then delivered by the Duke de Mayenne as lieutenant,\r\nby the legate, by the Cardinal de Pelve, by the bishop of Lyons, by\r\nRose, the fanatical rector of the University, by the Sieur de Rieux, as\r\nrepresentative of the nobility; and, lastly, by a certain Monsieur\r\nd'Aubray, for the _Tiers-Etat_. A burlesque _coda_ concludes the volume,\r\nthe joints of which are, first, a short verse satire on Pelve; secondly,\r\na collection of epigrams due to Passerat; and, thirdly, Durant's _Regret\r\nFunebre a Mademoiselle ma Commere sur le Trepas de son Ane_, a\r\ndelightful satire on the Leaguers, which did not appear in the first\r\nedition, but which yields to few things in the book.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the plan of the _Menippee_ has of itself not a\r\nlittle originality. Satirical comment and travesty devoted to political\r\naffairs had been common enough almost for centuries in France, but no\r\nsatire of the kind had hitherto flown so high, or with so well-organised\r\na flight. The seven speeches, which form the bulk of the book, display\r\nmoreover a remarkable variety and a still more remarkable combination of\r\nexcellences. The first six--those of Mayenne, the legate, Pelve, the\r\nbishop of Lyons, Rose, and Rieux, none of which is long--are, without\r\nexception, caricatures, and of that peculiar order of caricature in\r\nwhich the victim is made, without a glaring violation of probability, to\r\nrender himself vile and ridiculous, and to give utterance to the satire\r\nand invective which the author desires to pour upon him. Butler (who\r\nbeyond all doubt had the _Satyre Menippee_ in his mind when he projected\r\nhis own immortal travesty of the Puritan party) is the only writer who\r\nhas ever come near to its authors in this particular department of\r\nsatire. Treated as they were by different hands, there is a curiously\r\npleasing variety of style in the portraits. Mayenne uses a mixture of\r\naristocratic and somewhat haughty frankness with garrulous digression.\r\nThe two cardinals indulge in an astounding macaronic jargon, the one of\r\nItalian mingled with Latin, the other of Latin mingled with French. The\r\nbishop of Lyons, and Rose the rector, preach sermons, after the fashion\r\nof the time, thickly larded with quotations, stories, and so forth.\r\nRieux (he was a noted bandit) expresses with soldierly frankness his\r\nextreme surprise that he should have become a gentleman and the\r\nrepresentative of the nobility, and mildly reproaches Mayenne and the\r\nLeague for not having given _carte-blanche_ to himself and his likes to\r\nfinish off the _Politiques_ bag-and-baggage. But in the last harangue,\r\nthat of the representative of the _Tiers-Etat_, Claude d'Aubray, which\r\nis, as has been said, the work of Pithou, and which occupies something\r\nlike half the book, the tone is entirely altered. In this remarkable\r\ndiscourse the whole political situation is treated seriously, and with a\r\nmixture of practical vigour and literary skill of which there had hardly\r\nbeen any precedent instance. D'Aubray denounces the condition of Paris\r\nfirst, and the condition of the kingdom afterwards. The foreign\r\ngarrisons, the sufferings of private persons by the war, the deprivation\r\nor suspension of privileges, are all commented upon. A remarkable\r\nhistorical sketch of the religious wars follows, and then turn by turn\r\nthe speaker attacks those who have spoken before him, and exposes their\r\nconduct. A vigorous sketch of 'Le Roy que nous voulons et que nous\r\naurons,' leads up to the announcement that this king is no other than\r\n'Notre vray Roy legitime, naturel et souverain, Seigneur Henry de\r\nBourbon, cy-devant Roy de Navarre.' After this discomposing harangue the\r\nassembly breaks up in some confusion.\r\n\r\nThe _Satyre Menippee_ had an immense effect, and may, perhaps, be justly\r\ndescribed as the first example, in modern politics, of a literary work\r\nthe effect of which was really great and lasting. It is not surprising\r\nthat such should have been its fortune. For it is a remarkably happy\r\nmixture of the older style of _gaulois_ jocularity (in which\r\nexaggeration, personal attack, insinuations of a more or less scandalous\r\ncharacter and the like, furnished the attraction) and the newer style of\r\nchastened and comparatively polished prose. The greater part of the\r\nfirst six speeches are of a more antique cast than Montaigne; and though\r\nthe speech of D'Aubray exhibits a more elaborate and less familiar\r\nstyle, it too is definitely plain and popular in manner. Although there\r\nare the allusions usual at the time to classical subjects, the Pleiade\r\npedantry, with which at least two of the contributors, Passerat and\r\nRapin, were sufficiently imbued, is conspicuously absent. Rabelais is\r\nfrequently alluded to; and when the style of the book and the obvious\r\nintention of appealing to the general, which it exhibits, are\r\nconsidered, no better testimony to the popularity of _Gargantua_ and\r\n_Pantagruel_ could be produced. The descriptions, too, have a\r\nRabelaisian minuteness and richness about them; and in the burlesque\r\nparts the influence of that master is equally perceptible. But the\r\nstrictly practical point of view is always maintained; and the\r\ntemptation, always a strong one with French writers of the middle age\r\nand Renaissance, to lose sight of this in endless developments of mere\r\namusing buffoonery, is constantly resisted. There is certainly less\r\nexaggeration in the _Menippee_ than in _Hudibras_, though the personal\r\nweaknesses of the innumerable individual persons satirised contribute\r\nmore to the general effect than they do in Butler's great satire. The\r\ndistinguishing trait of the _Satyre Menippee_, next to those already\r\nmentioned, is the constant rain of slight ironical touches contributing\r\nto the general effect. Thus the arms of the processioning Leaguers are,\r\n'le tout rouille par Humilite Catholique;' the League scholastics and\r\npreachers 'forment tous leurs arguments in _ferio_.' The deputies'\r\nbenches are covered with cloth, 'parsemees de croisettes de Lorraine et\r\nde larmes miparties de vair et de faux argent.' These sure and rapid\r\ntouches distinguish the book strongly from nearly all mediaeval satire,\r\nin which the satirists are wont, whenever they make a point, to dwell on\r\nit, and expound it, and illustrate it, and make the most of it, until it\r\nloses almost all its piquancy. Very different from this over-elaboration\r\nis the confident irony of the _Menippee_, which trusts to the\r\nintelligence of the reader for understanding and emphasis. 'Vous\r\nprevoyez bien,' says Mayenne, 'les dangers et inconveniens de la paix\r\nqui met ordre a tout, et rend le droit a qui il appartient.' Hardly even\r\nAntoine de la Salle, and certainly no other among the authors of the\r\npreceding centuries, would have ventured to leave this, obvious as it\r\nseems now-a-days, to reach the reader by itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regnier.]\r\n\r\nA similar but a still more remarkable, because an individually complete,\r\nexample of the combination of Gallican tradition with classical study\r\nwas soon afterwards shown by Mathurin Regnier[223]. Regnier was born at\r\nChartres on the 21st of December, 1573, his father being Jacques\r\nRegnier, a citizen of position; his mother was Simonne Desportes, sister\r\nof the poet. Jacques Regnier desired for his son the ecclesiastical, but\r\nnot the poetical, eminence of his brother-in-law, and Mathurin was\r\ntonsured at nine years old. The boy, however, wished to follow his\r\nuncle's steps in the other direction, and early began to write. It is\r\nsaid that he wrote lampoons on the inhabitants of his native town, and,\r\nrepeating them to the frequenters of a tennis-court which his father had\r\nbuilt, got himself thus into trouble. His father's threats and\r\npunishments, however, had no more effect than is usual in such cases,\r\nand Regnier soon, but at a date not exactly known, betook himself to his\r\nuncle at Paris. By Desportes, who was in favour with many high\r\npersonages, he was recommended to the Cardinal de Joyeuse, and took part\r\nin that prelate's embassy to Rome in 1593. Joyeuse, however, did nothing\r\nfor him, and in 1601 he again went to Rome in the suite of Philippe de\r\nBethune. He returned before long, and, in 1604, a canonry, to the\r\nreversion of which he had been presented long before, fell in. His first\r\ncollection of satires appeared in 1608. Five years afterwards, in 1613,\r\non the 22nd of October, he died at Rouen, having not quite completed his\r\nfortieth year. His way of life had unfortunately been by no means\r\nregular, and his early death is said to have been directly caused by his\r\nexcesses.\r\n\r\nIn this short sketch almost everything that is known of Regnier, except\r\na few anecdotes, has been included, and the total is, it will be seen,\r\nexceedingly meagre. Nor is his work abundant even for a man who died\r\ncomparatively young. Sixteen satires, three epistles, five elegies, and\r\na few miscellaneous pieces, make it up, and probably the total does not\r\nexceed seven or eight thousand lines. The relative excellence of this\r\nwork is however exceedingly high. Regnier is almost the only French poet\r\nbefore the so-called classical period who has continuously maintained\r\nhis reputation, and who has only been decried by a few eccentric or\r\nincompetent critics. He was an ardent defender of the Ronsardising\r\ntradition, yet Malherbe, whom he did not hesitate to attack, thought and\r\nspoke highly of him. In the next age Boileau allotted to him a mixture\r\nof praise and blame which is not too apposite, but in which the praise\r\nfar exceeds the blame, and elsewhere declared him to be the French\r\nwriter, before Moliere, who best knew human nature. The approval of\r\nBoileau secured that of the eighteenth century, while Regnier's defence\r\nof the Pleiade propitiated the first Romantics. Thus buttressed on\r\neither side, he has had nothing to fear from literary revolutions. Nor\r\nwill any judgment which looks rather at merit than authority arrive at\r\nan unfavourable conclusion respecting him. His satires are not indeed\r\nabsolutely the first of their kind in French. Vauquelin de la Fresnaye,\r\nJean de la Taille, and above all, D'Aubigne, had preceded him. But in\r\nbreadth as well as, except in the case of D'Aubigne, in force, and above\r\nall in even excellence and technical merit, he far surpassed those who\r\nin a manner had shown him the way. His satire is exclusively social, and\r\nthus it escapes one of the chief drawbacks of political satire, that of\r\ndealing with matters of more or less ephemeral existence and interest.\r\nHe has indeed borrowed considerably from the ancients, but he has\r\nalmost always made his borrowings his own, and he has in some cases\r\nimproved on his originals. He has softened the exaggerated air of moral\r\nindignation which his English contemporaries, Hall and Marston, borrowed\r\nfrom Juvenal, and which sits so awkwardly on them and on many other\r\nsatirists. He has avoided such still more awkward followings as that\r\nwhich made Pope upset all English literary history in order to echo\r\nHorace's remarks about Rome and Greece. Sometimes he has fallen into the\r\nbesetting sin of his countrymen, the tendency to represent mere types or\r\neven abstractions instead of lifelike individuals embodying the type,\r\nbut he has more often avoided it. His descriptive passages are of\r\nextraordinary vigour and accuracy of touch, and his occasional strokes\r\nare worthy of almost any satiric or didactic poet. He is perhaps\r\nweakest, like all poets with the signal exception of Dryden, when he is\r\npanegyrical. Yet his first satire--in the order of arrangement not of\r\nwriting--addressed to the King, Henri IV., has much merit. The second,\r\non poets, has more, and abounds in vigorous strokes, such as that of the\r\ncourtier bard who\r\n\r\n    Meditant un sonnet, medite un eveche;\r\n\r\nand as the couplet which concludes a lively sketch of his diplomatic\r\nexperiences--\r\n\r\n    Mais instruit par le temps a la fin j'ai connu\r\n    Que la fidelite n'est pas grand revenu.\r\n\r\nThis poem, which contains some humorous descriptions of the poverty of\r\npoets, ends with an eloquent panegyric on Ronsard. The next, on 'La Vie\r\nde la Cour,' attacks a very favourite subject of the age, and winds up\r\nwith an extremely well-told version of the fable of the beast of prey\r\nand the mule whose name is written on its hoof. The fourth returns to\r\nthe subject of the poverty of poets. The fifth argues at some length,\r\nand in a spirit not very far removed from that of Montaigne, the thesis\r\nthat 'Le gout particulier decide de tout.' It contains some of Regnier's\r\nfinest passages. A subject somewhat similar in kind, 'L'honneur ennemi\r\nde la vie,' gives further occasion, in the sixth, for the display of\r\nthe moralising spirit of the age, which, in Regnier, takes the form of\r\na kind of epicurean pococurantism mingled with occasional bursts of\r\nnoble sentiment. The seventh is one of the most personal of all; it is\r\nentitled 'L'amour qu'on ne peut dompter,' and is a comment on the text\r\n_Video meliora proboque_. The eighth is one of the innumerable\r\nimitations of the famous ninth satire of the first book of Horace, _Ibam\r\nforte via sacra_, and perhaps the happiest of all such, though it is\r\ndifficult not to regret that Regnier should have devoted his too rare\r\nmoments of work to mere imitation. The ninth, however, is open to no\r\nsuch charge. It is entitled _Le Critique outre_, and is an\r\nextraordinarily vigorous and happy remonstrance against the intolerant\r\npedantry with which Malherbe was criticising the Pleiade. This satire is\r\naddressed to Rapin, the veteran contributor to the _Menippee._ It is\r\nimpossible to describe the weak side of the reforms which Malherbe, and\r\nafter him Boileau, introduced into French poetry, better than in these\r\nlines, which deserve citation for their literary importance:--\r\n\r\n    Cependant leur scavoir ne s'estend seulement\r\n    Qu'a regratter un mot douteux au jugement,\r\n    Prendre garde qu'un qui ne heurte une diphtongue;\r\n    Espier si des vers la rime est breve ou longue;\r\n    Ou bien si la voyelle, a l'autre s'unissant,\r\n    Ne rend point a l'oreille un vers trop languissant.\r\n    Ils rampent bassement, foibles d'inventions,\r\n    Et n'osent, peu hardis, tenter les fictions,\r\n    Froids a l'imaginer; ear s'ils font quelque chose\r\n    C'est proser de la rime, et rimer de la prose,\r\n    Que l'art lime et relime, et polit de facon,\r\n    Qu'elle rend a l'oreille un agreable son.\r\n\r\nThe tenth satire, with its title 'Le souper ridicule,' seems to return\r\nto Horace, but in reality the scene described has little in common with\r\nthe _Coena_ of Nasidienus. It affords Regnier an excellent opportunity\r\nfor displaying his talent for Dutch painting, but is in this respect\r\ninferior to the sequel 'Le mauvais gite.' The subject of this is\r\nsufficiently unsavoury, and the satire is almost the only one which in\r\nthe least deserves Boileau's strictures on the author's 'rimes\r\ncyniques,' but the vigour and skill of the treatment are most\r\nremarkable. The twelfth is short, and once more apologetically personal.\r\nBut the thirteenth is the longest, one of the most famous, and\r\nunquestionably on the whole the best work of the author. It is entitled\r\n'Macette,' and describes an old woman who hides vice under a\r\nhypocritical mask and corrupts youth with her evil philosophy of the\r\nworld and its ways. Indebted in some measure to the _Roman de la Rose_\r\nfor the idea of his central character, Regnier is entirely original in\r\nhis method of treatment. Nowhere are his verses more vigorous--\r\n\r\n    Son oeil tout penitent ne pleure qu'eau beniste.\r\n    L'honneur est un vieux saint que l'on ne chomme plus.\r\n    La sage se sait vendre ou la sotte se donne.\r\n\r\nNowhere is Regnier so uniformly free from technical defects and from\r\ncolloquialisms in which he sometimes indulges. The fourteenth returns to\r\ngeneral and somewhat vague satire, dealing with the vanity of human\r\nreason and conduct, while the fifteenth is once more personal, 'Le Poete\r\nmalgre soi.' Lastly, the sixteenth sums up the author's theoretical\r\nphilosophy in the opening line, 'N'avoir crainte de rien et ne rien\r\nesperer.'\r\n\r\nThe satires are in bulk and in importance so much the larger part of the\r\nwork of Regnier, and represent such an important innovation in French\r\nliterature, that it has seemed well to describe them with some\r\nminuteness. The miscellaneous poems may be reviewed more rapidly, though\r\nthe best of them add very considerably to the poet's reputation, because\r\nthey show him in an entirely different light. Not a few of the elegies\r\nare imitated from Ovid, and some of them might perhaps have been left\r\nunwritten with advantage. Indeed, Regnier is here much more open to\r\nBoileau's censure than in his more famous verse. But some lyrical pieces\r\nexhibit his command of other measures besides the Alexandrine, and\r\nafford occasion for the expression of a melancholy and genuine\r\nsensibility which is not common in French poetry. The poem called\r\n'Plainte' is very beautiful, and is written in a lyric stanza of much\r\nmore elaboration than any which was to be used in France for two\r\ncenturies. One of its peculiarities is a hemistich replacing the\r\nexpected fourth line of the stanza, which is of eight verses, with\r\nsingularly musical effect. A so-called 'Ode' is almost better, and ends\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n    Un regret pensif et confus\r\n    D'avoir este, et n'estre plus,\r\n    Rend mon ame aux douleurs ouverte;\r\n    A mes despens, las! je vois bien\r\n    Qu'un bonheur comme estoit le mien\r\n    Ne se cognoist que par la perte.\r\n\r\nRegnier was in many ways a fitting representative for the close of the\r\ngreat poetical school of the sixteenth century. In manner he represented\r\nthe fusion of the purely Gallic school of Marot and Rabelais, with the\r\nclassical tradition of the Pleiade in its best form. His Alexandrines,\r\nif not quite so vigorous as D'Aubigne's, have all the polish that could\r\nbe expected before the administration of Malherbe's rules. His lyric\r\nmeasures have the boldness and harmony which those rules banished from\r\nFrench poetry for full seven generations. In matter he displays a\r\nsingular mixture of acute observation and philosophic criticism with\r\nardent sensibility both to pleasure and pain. This, as has been\r\nrepeatedly pointed out, is the dominant temper of the French\r\nRenaissance, and though in Regnier it shows something of the melancholy\r\nof the decadence as compared with the springing hope of Rabelais and the\r\ncalm maturity of Montaigne, it is scarcely less characteristic.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[222] Ed.

In this edition some of the dates and\r\nstatements in the text, which have been generally accepted, are\r\ncontested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF RENAISSANCE LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe literary movements of the sixteenth century in France and their\r\naccomplishments--in other words, the course and result of the French\r\nRenaissance--can be traced with greater ease and with more precision\r\nthan those of any other age of the literature. The movement is double,\r\nbut, unlike most movements, literary and other, it is not sufficiently\r\ndescribed as flux and reflux or action and reaction. The later or\r\nPleiade half of the century was in no sense a reaction against the first\r\nor Marot-Rabelais half. If there is an appearance of opposition between\r\nthe two it is only because, both in Marot and in Rabelais, there was\r\nactually a kind of reaction from the movement which faintly and\r\nimperfectly foreshadowed that of the Pleiade, the _rhetoriqueur_\r\npedantry of the writers from Chartier to Cretin. In this first half of\r\nthe century, while something of a protest was made by Rabelais\r\nexplicitly, and implicitly by Marot, against the indiscriminate\r\nLatinising of the French tongue, very much more was done by their\r\ncontemporaries, and in a manner by Rabelais himself, in the way of\r\nimporting novelties of subject, style, and language, both from ancient\r\nand modern sources. Long before Du Bellay wrote, Calvin had modelled the\r\nfirst serious and scholarly work of French prose very closely on a Latin\r\npattern. The translators, with Etienne Dolet and Amyot at their head,\r\nhad begun to transfer to the vernacular, in versions or in original\r\nwork, the principles of style which they had admired and imitated in the\r\nclassics. On the other hand, Marot, representing the extreme vernacular\r\nschool, succeeded, tolerably early in the period, in refining and\r\nchastening the language of the fifteenth century to such an extent that\r\nhis style, transmitted through La Fontaine, and then through the\r\nlighter work of the eighteenth century, has retained a certain hold on\r\nliterature for its particular purpose almost to the present day. The\r\nmost remarkable writer, from the point of view of style, in this part of\r\nthe century is perhaps Bonaventure des Periers, who displays both the\r\nvernacular purity free from classical mixture, and at the same time the\r\nRenaissance admiration and imitation of the classics in a very high\r\ndegree. Yet the same lesson is taught by the prose of Des Periers as by\r\nthe verse of Marot. The language had not as yet arrived at its full\r\ngrowth, it had not taken in its full supply of nourishment. It was\r\ntherefore not equal to the complete duties of a literary tongue. It\r\nwanted enriching, strengthening, educating.\r\n\r\nThis task it was which was performed, and performed on the whole with\r\nremarkable skill and success, by the Pleiade movement. It is not easy to\r\nfix on any period in the history of any other language in which, at an\r\ninterval of fifty years, the advance in the capacities, as distinguished\r\nfrom the mere accomplishments of the tongue, is so noticeable as it is\r\nin French between 1550 and 1600. It is not merely that between these\r\ndates writers of talent and even genius may be mentioned by the dozen,\r\nthat the language can boast of having added to its stores the odes of\r\nRonsard, the sonnets of Du Bellay, the myriad graceful songs of the\r\nlesser poets of the Pleiade, the stately descriptions of Du Bartas, the\r\nfiery invective of D'Aubigne, the polished satire of Regnier, the essays\r\nof Montaigne, the immortal pasquinades of the Menippee--it is that the\r\nwhole constitution and organisation of the language has been\r\nstrengthened and improved. That the secret of the Alexandrine has at\r\nlast been mastered means that the whole future course of French poetry\r\nis in a manner mapped out. That lyric measures have been devised,\r\nintricate, not merely in arrangement like those of the mediaeval forms,\r\nbut in harmony, means that at any future time French poets who choose to\r\nrecur to this storehouse may find the withal to equip themselves. That\r\nthe vocabulary has been enormously if somewhat indiscriminately\r\nincreased, means that writers in the future, at whatever loss they may\r\nbe for thought, need certainly be at no loss for words to express it.\r\nBut the gain is greater even than this. Not merely have the glossary,\r\nthe grammar, the prosody of the language been enriched, but entirely\r\nnew moulds in which literary work can be cast have been added to the\r\nliterature. The form of drama in which France was to achieve, with but\r\nlittle formal alteration, some of her greatest literary triumphs, has\r\nbeen discovered and acclimatised; the essay has become a recognised\r\nthing; attempts at history proper as distinct from mere annals and\r\nchronicles have been made. Literature, in short, is organised, and\r\nliterary labour works in matter roughly at least prepared and shaped.\r\nOne of the greatest drawbacks of mediaeval literature, the confusion of\r\nstyles, the handling of science in verse, of theology in terms taken\r\nfrom amatory romances, of politics in 'dreams,' of social satire in\r\nclumsy allegories, is cleared away. The form most suitable for every\r\nkind of literary work has been more or less made clear to the literary\r\nworkman, and a plentiful supply of material in the shape of vocabulary\r\nis at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThat this great accomplishment is on the whole the doing of the Pleiade\r\nin its larger sense, as designating and including the men of letters of\r\n1550-1600, no impartial student of the period can doubt. But at the same\r\ntime there is no doubt either that their work was both incomplete and in\r\nsome respects open to grave objection. They had, like all reformers,\r\nliterary as well as political, neglected to preserve the historical\r\ncontinuity, and deliberately turned their backs on the traditions of the\r\nlanguage and the literature. Their importations and imitations had been\r\nsometimes unnecessary, sometimes awkward, sometimes absurd. The mass of\r\ntheir contributions required examination, arrangement, and no doubt in\r\nsome cases rejection. Moreover, they had on the whole concentrated their\r\nattention too much upon poetry; prose, the less exquisite but the more\r\nuseful instrument, had been comparatively neglected. Almost all styles\r\nhad been tried in it, but no general style nor the conditions of any had\r\nbeen elaborated. In drama much remained to be done. The model was there\r\nin the rough, but the workmen had been unskilful, and fifty years of\r\npractice on the plan of Jodelle had not yet resulted in the composition\r\nof one really dramatic play. In short, though the Pleiade movement had\r\nbegun by being nothing if not critical, it had not kept up the habit of\r\nself-criticism. The application of this criticism was what was left for\r\nthe seventeenth century to supply, and at the same time the elaboration\r\nof a complete and workman-like prose style. We shall see how early and\r\nhow eagerly this task was accepted, and how thoroughly it was carried\r\nout; so thoroughly, that the seventeenth century is the age of perfect\r\nFrench prose. But what was gained in prose was lost in poetry, and,\r\nputting the dramatists aside, the drop in this respect from the\r\nsixteenth to the seventeenth century is immense. The sixteenth is,\r\nputting our own days out of question, the palmy time of poetry in\r\nFrance. The urbanity of Marot, the stately grace of Ronsard and his\r\nfollowers, the majesty of Du Bartas, the fire of D'Aubigne, the nervous\r\nand yet effortless strength of Regnier, have never been surpassed, and\r\nuntil the last half century they have rarely been equalled. If to this\r\nbe added the more irregular and unequal, but hardly inferior merits of\r\nthe best sixteenth-century prose, the inexhaustible humour of Rabelais,\r\nthe simplicity and varied colour of the great memoir-writers, the subtle\r\neloquence of Montaigne, it may perhaps seem that the period can contest\r\nthe primacy with any other. The dispute between it and its successor is,\r\nhowever, only an instance of one which recurs again and again in\r\nliterature, and which neither need nor should be handled here at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPOETS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Malherbe.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the poetry of the seventeenth century in France naturally\r\nand necessarily opens with Malherbe, though he was forty-five years old\r\nat its beginning, and considerably the senior of Regnier, who has been\r\nincluded among the poets of the Renaissance. Francois de Malherbe[224]\r\nwas born at Caen in 1555, being the eldest son of his father, another\r\nFrancois de Malherbe, and both on the father's and mother's side of\r\nnoble family. He was educated at his native town, in Germany and in\r\nParis, and when he was twenty-one he entered the army. He married in\r\n1581, and had three children, two of whom died young--a circumstance not\r\nimmaterial in connection with his most famous poem, which is a\r\n'Consolation' to a certain M. du Perier, whose daughter Marguerite had\r\ndied in her youth. He seems to have written verses tolerably early, but,\r\nexercising on himself the same rigid principles of criticism which he\r\napplied to others, he preserved none or hardly any of them. It was not\r\ntill he was past forty that his best-known poems were written, and the\r\nwhole amount of his surviving work is not large. During the first\r\ntwo-thirds of his life he was not rich, for his patrimony was scanty,\r\nand the death of the Grand Prior, Henri d'Angouleme, to whom he had\r\nattached himself, deprived him of the chances of preferment. But in\r\n1605 he was presented to Henri IV.; he soon afterwards received various\r\nplaces, and for more than twenty years was a court favourite, and in a\r\nway the autocrat of poetry. He died in 1628.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Malherbe's poetical work is by no means\r\nvoluminous: a small volume of two hundred pages, not very closely or\r\nminutely printed, contains it all; and ingenious persons have calculated\r\nthat as a rule he did not write more than four or five verses a month.\r\nNor even of this carefully produced, and still more carefully weeded,\r\nresult is there much that can be read with pleasure by a modern student\r\nof poetry. The verse by which Malherbe is best known,\r\n\r\n    Et, rose, elle a vecu ce que vivent les roses,\r\n\r\nis worth all the rest of his work, and it can hardly be said to be more\r\nthan a very graceful and touching conceit. But Malherbe's position in\r\nthe history of French poetry is a very important one. He deliberately\r\nassumed the functions of a reformer of literature; and whatever may be\r\nthought of the result of his reforms, their durability and the almost\r\nentire acquiescence with which they were received prove that there must\r\nhave been something in them remarkably germane to the spirit and taste\r\nand genius of the nation. His first attempt was the overthrow of the\r\nPleiade. He ridiculed their phraseology, frowned on their metres, and,\r\nbeing himself destitute of the romantic inspiration which had animated\r\nthem, set himself to reduce poetry to carefully-worded metrical prose.\r\nThe story is always told of him that he went minutely through a copy of\r\nRonsard, striking out whatever he disapproved of; and when some one\r\npointed out the mass of lines that were left, that he drew his pen\r\n(presumably across the title-page, for it is not obvious how else he\r\ncould have done it) through the rest at one stroke. The insolent folly\r\nof this is glaring enough, for Malherbe is not worthy as a poet to\r\nunloose the shoe-latchet of Ronsard. But the critic had rightly\r\nappreciated his time. The tendency of the French seventeenth century in\r\npoetry proper was towards the restriction of vocabulary and rhythm, the\r\navoidance of original and daring metaphor and suggestion, the perfecting\r\nof a few metres (with the Alexandrine at their head) into a delicate\r\nbut monotonous harmony, and the rejection of individual licence in\r\nfavour of rigid rule. The influence of Boileau came rapidly to second\r\nthat of Malherbe, and the result is that not a single poet--the\r\ndramatists are here excluded--of the seventeenth century in France\r\ndeserves more than fair second-class rank. La Fontaine, indeed, was a\r\nwriter of the greatest genius, but, though the form which his work takes\r\nis metrical, the highest merits of poetry proper are absent. La\r\nFontaine, too, was himself, though an admirer of Malherbe, a rebel to\r\nthe Malherbe tradition, and delighted both in reading and imitating the\r\nwork of the Renaissance and the middle ages. But he is always clear,\r\nprecise, and matter-of-fact in the midst of fancy, never attaining to\r\nthe peculiar vague suggestiveness which constitutes the charm of poetry\r\nproper.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The School of Malherbe.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vers de Societe.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Voiture.]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, impossible that so large a change should accomplish\r\nitself at once, and signs of mixed influences appear accordingly in all\r\nthe poetical work of the first half of the century. Cardinal du Perron,\r\nMalherbe's introducer at court, was himself a poet of merit, but rather\r\nin the Pleiade style. His _Temple de l'Inconstance_, though rougher in\r\nform, is more poetical in substance than anything, save a very few\r\npieces, of Malherbe's. Chassignet displayed some of the same\r\ncharacteristics with a graver and more elegiac spirit. Gombaud is\r\nchiefly remarkable as a sonneteer. The two most famous of the actual\r\npupils of Malherbe were Maynard and Racan. Maynard was a diplomatist and\r\nlawyer of rank, who was born at Toulouse in 1582, and died in 1646. His\r\nwork is miscellaneous, and not very extensive, but it shows that he had\r\nlearned the secret of polished versification from Malherbe, and that he\r\nwas able to apply it with a good deal of vigour and of variety. Honorat\r\nde Bueil, Marquis de Racan[225], was the author of a pastoral drama,\r\n_Les Bergeries_, founded on, or imitated from, the _Astree_ of D'Urfe,\r\nof an elaborate version of the Psalms, and of a considerable number of\r\nthe miscellaneous poems, _stances_, _odes_, _epitres_, etc., which were\r\nfashionable. Racan, though his amiable private character and the\r\ncompliance of his principal work with a fashionable folly of the time\r\nhave caused him to be somewhat over-estimated traditionally, was a\r\nthoroughly pleasing poet, with a great command of fluent and melodious\r\nverse, a genuine love of nature, and occasionally a power of producing\r\npoetry of a true kind which was shared by few of his contemporaries. The\r\nremarkable author of _Tyr et Sidon_, Jean de Schelandre, produced,\r\nbesides his play, a considerable number of miscellaneous poems; but he\r\nwas a thorough reactionary, avowed his contempt of Malherbe, and\r\nstudied, not without success, Ronsard and his own coreligionist Du\r\nBartas as models. One of the most original, though at the same time one\r\nof the most unequal poets of the early seventeenth century, was\r\nTheophile de Viaud, often called Theophile[226] simply. He, too, was a\r\ndramatist, but his dramas do not do him much credit, their style being\r\nexaggerated and 'precious.' On the other hand, his miscellaneous poems,\r\nthough very unequal, include much work of remarkable beauty. The pieces\r\nentitled 'La Solitude,' 'Sur une Tempete,' and the stanzas beginning\r\n'Quand tu me vois baiser tes bras,' have all the fervour and\r\npicturesqueness of the Pleiade without its occasional blemishes of\r\npedantic expression. Theophile was a loose liver and an unfortunate man.\r\nHe was accused, justly or unjustly, of writing indecent verses, was\r\nimprisoned, and died young. All the poets hitherto mentioned were\r\nwriters of miscellaneous verse, who, except in so far as they held to\r\nthe elder tradition of Ronsard or the new gospel of Malherbe, can hardly\r\nbe said to have belonged to any school. Towards the middle of the\r\ncentury, however, two well-defined fashions of poetry, with some minor\r\nones, distinguished themselves. There was, in the first place, the\r\nschool of the _coterie_ poets, who devoted themselves to producing _vers\r\nde societe_, either for the ladies, or for the great men of the period.\r\nThe chief of this school was beyond all question Voiture[227]. This\r\nadmirable writer of prose and verse published absolutely nothing during\r\nhis lifetime, though his work was in private the delight of the salons.\r\nThat it should be, under the circumstances, somewhat frivolous is almost\r\nunavoidable. But, especially after the cessation of the great flow of\r\ninspiration which had characterised the sixteenth century, it was of no\r\nsmall importance that the art of perfect expression should be cultivated\r\nin French. Voiture was one of those who contributed most to the\r\ncultivation of this art. His letters are as correct as those of Balzac,\r\nand much less stilted; and of his poetry it is sufficient to say that\r\nnothing more charming of the kind has ever been written than the sonnet\r\nto Uranie, which stirred up a literary war, or the rondeau 'Ma foi c'est\r\nfait de moi.' This last put once more in fashion a beautiful and\r\nthoroughly French form, which it had been one of the worst deeds of the\r\nPleiade to make unfashionable. The chief rival of Voiture was Benserade,\r\na much younger man, whose sonnet on Job was held to excel, though it\r\ncertainly does not, that to Uranie. Benserade was of higher birth and\r\nlarger fortune than Voiture, and long outlived him. He was a great\r\nwriter of ballets or masques, and not unfrequently, like Voiture, showed\r\nthat a true poet underlay the fantastic disguises he put on. Around\r\nthese two are grouped numerous minor poets of different merit.\r\nBoisrobert, the favourite of Richelieu and the companion of Rotrou and\r\nCorneille in that minister's band of 'five poets;' Maleville, who in one\r\nof the sonnet-tournaments of the time, that of the _Belle Matineuse_,\r\nwas supposed to have excelled even Voiture; Colletet, whose poems make\r\nhim less important in literature than his Lives of the French poets,\r\nwhich unfortunately perished during the Commune before they had been\r\nfully printed; Gomberville, more famous as a novelist; Sarrasin, an\r\nadmirable prose writer, and a clever composer of ballades and other\r\nlight verse; Godeau, a bishop and a very clever versifier; Blot, who was\r\nrather a political than a social rhymer; Marigny, who was also famous\r\nfor his Mazarinades, but whose satirical power was by no means the only\r\nside of his poetical talent; Charleval, whose personal popularity was\r\ngreater than his literary ability; Maucroix, the friend of La Fontaine;\r\nSegrais, an eclogue writer of no small merit; Chapelle, an idle\r\nepicurean, who derives most of his fame from the fact of his having been\r\nintimate with all the foremost literary men of the time, and from his\r\nhaving composed, in company with Bachaumont, a _Voyage_ in mixed prose\r\nand verse, the form of which was long very popular in France and was\r\nimitated with especial success by Anthony Hamilton and Voltaire;\r\nPavillon, who deserves a very similar general description, but who gave\r\nno such single example of his abilities: all belong to this class.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Epic School. Chapelain.]\r\n\r\nSide by side with the frivolous school, but in curious contrast with it,\r\nthere existed a school of ponderous epic writers, the extirpation of\r\nwhich is the best claim of Boileau to the gratitude of posterity. The\r\ntypical poets of this class are Georges de Scudery, the author of\r\n_Alaric_, and Chapelain, the author of the _Pucelle_. Scudery was a\r\nsoldier and a man of considerable talent, who lacked nothing but\r\npatience and the power of self-criticism to produce really good work.\r\nLike his more famous sister, he had invention and literary facility. His\r\nplays are not without merit in parts, and his epic of _Alaric_, amidst\r\nastonishing platitudes and extravagances, has occasional good lines. But\r\nChapelain is by far the most remarkable figure of the school. He was\r\nbred up to be a poet from his earliest age, and by a stroke of luck,\r\nimpossible in less anomalous times, he was taken at his own valuation\r\nfor years. _La Pucelle_ was quoted in manuscript, and anxiously expected\r\nfor half a short lifetime. It only appeared to be hopelessly damned.\r\nThere are passages in it of merit, but they are associated with lines\r\nwhich read like designed burlesques. The onslaughts of Boileau have\r\ncreated a kind of reaction in favour of Chapelain with some who disagree\r\nwith Boileau's poetical principles: but he is not defensible. His odes\r\nare indeed tolerable in parts; not so the _Pucelle_, save, as has been\r\nsaid, in occasional lines. The _Clovis_ of Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin is\r\nworse than the _Pucelle_. On the other hand, the Pere le Moyne in his\r\n_St. Louis_, taking apparently Du Bartas as his model, produced work\r\nwhich, if not very readable as a whole, manifests real and very\r\nconsiderable poetical talent. Lastly, Saint Amant in the _Moise Sauve_\r\nshowed how far below himself a clever writer may be when he mistakes his\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacchanalian School. Saint Amant.]\r\n\r\nSaint Amant[228], who, to do him justice, did not call _Moise Sauve_ an\r\nepic but an 'idylle heroique,' is the link between this school and a\r\nthird composed of purely convivial poets, who even in this century\r\nfurnished work of remarkable excellence, and who produced a numerous and\r\nbrilliant progeny in the next. Saint Amant's Anacreontic poems are of\r\ngreat merit. Of the same class was Saint Pavin, who was not merely a\r\nfree liver, but a member of the small but influential free-thinking sect\r\nwhich preceded and gave birth to the _Philosophes_ of the next century.\r\nThis time, moreover, was the period of a curious literary trick, the\r\nresuscitation or forging of the convivial poems of Oliver Basselin by a\r\nNorman lawyer of the name of Jean le Houx. A genuine and contemporary\r\nBasselin, in the person of a carpenter named Adam Billaut, produced some\r\nnotable work of the same kind. Unfortunately the Anacreontic poetry of\r\nthis time suffers from the too frequent coarseness of its language; a\r\nfault which indeed was not fully corrected until Beranger's days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: La Fontaine.]\r\n\r\nThe members, however, of all these schools have long lost their hold on\r\nall but students of literature, and, with the exception of La Fontaine\r\nand Boileau, it is not easy to mention any non-dramatic poet of the\r\nseventeenth century who has kept a place in the general memory. Jean la\r\nFontaine[229] was born at Chateau Thierry in Champagne in the year 1621,\r\nand died at Paris in 1695. His father held a considerable post as ranger\r\nof the neighbouring forests, an office which passed to his son. La\r\nFontaine seems to have been carelessly educated, but after a certain\r\ntime literature attracted him, and he began to study in a desultory\r\nfashion, without however, as it would appear, being himself tempted to\r\nwrite. At the age of six-and-twenty he married Marie Hericart, a girl of\r\nsixteen, who is said to have been both amiable and beautiful, and not\r\nlong afterwards he was left his own master by his father's death. He was\r\nsuited very ill by nature either to fill a responsible office or to be\r\nhead of a house. The well-known stories of his absence of mind, his\r\nsimplicity, his indifference to outward affairs, have no doubt been\r\nexaggerated, but there is, equally without doubt, a foundation of fact\r\nin them. On the other hand, though the most serious charges against his\r\nwife seem to rest on no foundation, it is certain that she had little\r\naptitude for housewifery. After a time the household was broken up,\r\nthough there was offspring of the marriage. A division of goods was\r\neffected, and husband and wife separated, not to meet again except on\r\nvisits and for brief spaces of time, though they seem to have remained\r\non perfectly friendly terms. La Fontaine went to Paris, and very soon\r\nattracted the notice of Fouquet, the magnificent superintendent of the\r\nfinances, who gave him a pension of a thousand livres and made him a\r\nmember of his literary household. Here La Fontaine began to write. At\r\nthe downfall of Fouquet he was constant to his friend, and produced the\r\nbest-known of his miscellaneous poems, the 'Pleurez, Nymphes de\r\nVaux[230].' The misfortune unsettled him for a time, and he travelled\r\nabout. But returning to his native place, he was taken into favour by\r\nthe Duchess of Bouillon, and this was the beginning of a series of\r\npatronages which lasted till the end of his life. Once more visiting\r\nParis, he became a favourite with many men and women of rank, and began\r\nhis serious literary work by producing the first part of his _Contes_.\r\nThe remaining parts and the _Fables_ appeared at intervals during the\r\nremainder of his life. His second visit to Paris brought about his\r\ntraditional association with Boileau, Moliere, and Racine, the four\r\nmeeting at regular intervals, either in taverns or at lodgings in the\r\nRue Vieux Colombier. During the later years of his life La Fontaine was\r\na confirmed Parisian. His office at Chateau Thierry had been sold, and\r\nhe was the guest of various hospitable persons, the chief of whom was\r\nMadame de la Sabliere. In 1668 appeared the first part of the _Fables_\r\nwith universal approval. But the free character of the _Contes_, and\r\nstill more the association of La Fontaine with some of the freethinkers\r\nwho were in ill-repute with the king's spiritual advisers, retarded his\r\nadmission to the Academy. When Colbert died, La Fontaine and Boileau\r\nwere the two candidates; an awkward accident, considering their\r\nfriendship, and the fact that the court was as decidedly for Boileau as\r\nthe Academy itself for La Fontaine. The latter was elected, but the king\r\ndelayed his assent, and even seemed likely to exercise a veto, when\r\nfortunately a second vacancy occurred, and Boileau being elected, both\r\nwere approved by the king, Boileau warmly, La Fontaine with the\r\ngrudging terms 'Vous pouvez recevoir La Fontaine; il a promis d'etre\r\nsage.' A curious warning of a similar tenor was contained in the\r\n'Discours de Reception.'\r\n\r\nLa Fontaine's work is considerable, including many miscellaneous poems,\r\nthe romance of _Psyche_, and various dramatic attempts which were more\r\nor less failures. But the _Contes_ and the _Fables_ are the only works\r\nwhich have held their ground with posterity, and it is upon them that\r\nhis reputation is justly based. The first part of the _Contes_ appeared\r\nat the extreme end of 1664[231], the second in 1667, the third in 1671,\r\nbut the author added pieces in successive editions. The first part of\r\nthe _Fables_ appeared in 1668, dedicated to the Dauphin, the second in\r\n1679, dedicated to Madame de Montespan, the third in 1693, dedicated to\r\nthe Duc de Bourgogne, who is said to have been taught by Fenelon to\r\ndelight in La Fontaine, and to have sent him just before his death all\r\nthe money he had. The two books are complementary to each other, and La\r\nFontaine's genius cannot be judged by either alone. It has been remarked\r\nthat he was a diligent though apparently a very desultory reader. He\r\nread the Italians, and, apparently with still more relish and profit,\r\nthe works of the old French writers, to whom the Italians owed so much.\r\nThe spirit of the Fabliaux had been dead, or at any rate dormant, since\r\nMarot and Rabelais; La Fontaine revived it. Even purists, like his\r\nfriend Boileau, admitted a certain archaism in lighter poetry, and La\r\nFontaine would in all probability have troubled himself very little if\r\nthey had not. His language is, therefore, more supple, varied, and racy\r\nthan even that of Moliere, and this is his first excellence. His second\r\nis a faculty of easy narration in verse, which is absolutely unequalled\r\nexcept perhaps in Pulci and Ariosto, while it is certainly unsurpassed\r\nanywhere. His third distinguishing point is his power of insinuating, it\r\nmay be a satirical point, it may be a moral reflection, which is also\r\nhardly equalled and as certainly unsurpassed. In the authors whom La\r\nFontaine followed, either deliberately or unconsciously, the models of\r\nhis tales and his fables were indiscriminately mingled; but he separated\r\nthem by so rigid a line that, while there is hardly a phrase in his\r\n_Fables_ which is not suited _virginibus puerisque_, the _Contes_ are\r\nnot exactly a book for youth. In the latter the author has taken\r\nsubjects, always amusing but not unfrequently loose, from the old\r\nfabulists, from Boccaccio, from the French prose tale-tellers of the\r\n_Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles_ and similar collections, from Rabelais, from\r\na few Italian writers of the Renaissance, and has dressed them up in the\r\nincomparable narrative of which he alone has the secret. Where he treads\r\nin the steps of the greatest writers he is almost always best. 'Joconde'\r\nsupplies the opportunity of a remarkable comparison with Ariosto; 'La\r\nFiancee du Roi de Garbe' of a still more remarkable comparison with\r\nBoccaccio. In this latter respect the palm of vivid and varied narration\r\nis with La Fontaine, but he misses something of the spirit of the\r\noriginal in his portrait of Alaciel; indeed La Fontaine's weakest point\r\nis in the comparatively pedestrian character of his treatment. He has\r\nlittle romance, and in translating, not merely the Italians but such\r\ncountrymen and women of his own as the authors of the Heptameron, he\r\nloses the poetical charm which, as has been pointed out, graces and\r\nsaves the morality or immorality of the Renaissance. Therefore, despite\r\nthe wonderful variety and vivid painting of the _Contes_, presenting a\r\nseries of pictures which for these qualities have few rivals in\r\nliterature, the disapproval with which censors more rigid than Johnson\r\n(whose excuse of Prior will fairly stretch to Prior's original) have\r\nvisited them is not altogether unjustifiable.\r\n\r\nThe Fables, with hardly less excellence of the purely literary kind, are\r\nfortunately free from the least vestige of any similar fault. La\r\nFontaine, instead of in the smallest degree degrading the beast-fable,\r\nhas, on the contrary, exalted it to almost the highest point of which it\r\nis capable. Not many books have made and kept a more durable and solid\r\nreputation. The few dissentient voices in the chorus of eulogy have been\r\nthose of eccentric crotcheteers like Rousseau, or sentimentalists like\r\nLamartine. It is, indeed, impossible to read the Fables without\r\nprejudice and not be captivated by them. As mere narratives they are\r\ncharming, and the perpetual presence of an undercurrent of sly,\r\ngood-humoured, satirical meaning relieves them from all charge of\r\ninsipidity. La Fontaine, like Goldsmith, was with his pen in his hand as\r\nshrewd and as deeply learned in human nature as without it he was simple\r\nand _naif_.\r\n\r\nSomething has to be said of the form and strictly poetical value of\r\nthese two remarkable books--as remarkable, let it be remembered, for\r\ntheir bulk as for their excellence, for between them they cannot contain\r\nmuch less than 30,000 verses. The measure is almost always an irregular\r\nmixture of lines of different lengths, rhyming sometimes in couplets,\r\nsometimes in interlaced stanzas, which La Fontaine established as the\r\nvehicle of serio-comic narration. For this, in his hands, it is\r\nextraordinarily well fitted. As for the strictly poetic value of the\r\nwork, it is perhaps significant that though he is, taking quantity and\r\nexcellence together, the most important non-dramatic writer of verse of\r\nthe whole century in France, he is rarely thought of (out of France) as\r\na poet. A poet, indeed, in the highest sense of the word he is not. He\r\nhas hardly any passion, evidences of it being almost confined to the\r\nelegy to Fouquet and, perhaps, as M. Theodore de Banville pleads, to the\r\n'Faucon' and 'Courtisane Amoureuse' of the _Contes_. He has no\r\nindefinite suggestion of beauty; even his descriptions of nature, though\r\nalways accurate and picturesque, being somewhat prosaic. He may be said\r\nto be a prose writer of the very first class who chose to write in\r\nverse, and who justified his choice by a wonderful technical ability in\r\nthe particular form of verse which he used. There is no greater mistake\r\nthan the supposition that La Fontaine's verse-writing is mere facile\r\nimprovisation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boileau.]\r\n\r\nNicolas Boileau[232], who was long known in France as the 'Law-giver of\r\nParnassus,' and who, perhaps, exercised a more powerful and lasting\r\ninfluence over the literature of his native country than any other\r\ncritic has ever enjoyed, was born at Paris on All Saints' Day, 1636. His\r\nfather held the post of registrar of one of the numerous courts of law,\r\nand his family had legal connections of wide range and long date. He\r\nhimself was brought up to the law, but had not the least inclination\r\nfor it; and at his father's death, which happened exactly when he\r\nattained his majority, his inheritance was considerable enough to allow\r\nhim to do as he pleased. The family was a large one, and, according to a\r\ncustom of the time, the brothers, or at least some of them, were\r\ndistinguished by additional surnames. That which Nicolas\r\ntook--Despreaux--was, at any rate during his youth, more frequently used\r\nthan his patronymic, and has continued to be applied to him\r\nindifferently, thereby causing some odd blunders on the part of ignorant\r\npeople. He himself sometimes signed Despreaux and sometimes\r\nBoileau-Despreaux. Besides law, he had also studied theology, and,\r\nthough he never took orders, he enjoyed for a considerable time a priory\r\nat Beauvais, the profits of which, however, he returned when he\r\ndefinitely abandoned the idea of the church as a profession. He very\r\nearly made attempts in literature, and when he was a man of seven- or\r\neight-and-twenty, he joined La Fontaine, Racine, and Moliere in the\r\ncelebrated society of four. Social and literary criticism was even thus\r\nearly his forte, and his first collections of Horatian satire were\r\npublished in 1666, though, owing to the influence of Chapelain, the\r\nroyal privilege was shortly after withdrawn from them. Boileau, however,\r\nsoon became a great favourite with the king, as, though in actual\r\nconversation he retained his natural freedom of speech, he did not\r\nhesitate to use the most grovelling flattery of expression in verse.\r\nPensions and places were given to him freely, so that, his own property\r\nbeing not inconsiderable, he was one of the few wealthy men of letters\r\nof the day. He was kept out of the Academy for some time by the fact\r\nthat he had libelled half its members and was unpopular with the other\r\nhalf, but the royal influence at last got him in in 1684. In his later\r\nyears the morose arrogance, which was his chief characteristic,\r\nincreased on him, and was doubtless aggravated by the bad health from\r\nwhich he suffered during the whole of his long life. He died in 1711,\r\nhaving outlived all his friends except Louis himself.\r\n\r\nBoileau's works consist of twelve satires, of the same number of\r\nepistles, of an _Art Poetique_, of the _Lutrin_, a serio-comic poem, of\r\ntwo odes, and of three or four score epigrams and miscellaneous pieces\r\nin verse, with a translation of Longinus on the Sublime, some short\r\ncritical dissertations, and a number of letters in prose. With the\r\nexception of the _Lutrin_ it will be observed that almost all his\r\npoetical work is very closely modelled on Horace. His satire is\r\nextremely clever, but, as necessarily happens when the frame and manner\r\nof one time are used for the circumstances of another, it is altogether\r\nartificial. The Horatian satire is nothing if not personal, and as\r\nBoileau (even more than Pope, who strongly resembles him) had a bad\r\nheart, his personalities are unusually reckless and offensive. Thus in a\r\ncouplet against parasites he inserted at one time the name of Colletet\r\n(son of the Colletet mentioned above), at another that of Pelletier,\r\nthough both were notoriously free from the vice, and guilty of no fault\r\nexcept poverty and a disposition to produce indifferent verse. Boileau's\r\ncrusade, too, against the minor poets of his day was unfortunately\r\nfollowed by his own production of a ridiculous ode, excellently\r\nburlesqued by Prior, on the taking of Namur in 1692 by the French. This,\r\nwith certain pieces of Young's, is perhaps the most glaring example\r\nextant of how a writer of great talent and literary skill may combine\r\nthe basest flattery with the most abjectly bad verse. But where he\r\nconfined himself to his proper sphere, Boileau exhibited no small power.\r\nHe was, in fact, a slashing reviewer in verse, and there has rarely been\r\nso effective a practitioner of the craft. Narrow as was his idea of\r\npoetry, it was perfectly clear and precise, and, as his pupil Racine\r\nshowed, he could teach it to others with the most striking success. _Le\r\nLutrin_, too, is a poem which, in a rather trivial kind, is something of\r\na masterpiece. Its subject, the quarrel of a chapter of ecclesiastics\r\nabout the position of a _lutrin_ (lectern), afforded Boileau plenty of\r\nopportunity for introducing that sarcasm on the upper middle classes\r\nwhich was his forte; the verse is polished and correct, the satire,\r\nthough rather facile and conventional, agreeable enough. His satires and\r\nepistles are full of striking traits evidently studied from the life,\r\nbut he is always personal and almost always artificial, never rising to\r\nthe large satiric conception of Regnier or of Dryden. So, too, most of\r\nthe stories which are recorded of him (and they are many) are stories of\r\nill-natured remarks. In his heart of hearts he knew and acknowledged\r\nthe greatness of Corneille, yet formally and in public he could not\r\nrefrain from directing unjust satire at the veteran whose masterpieces\r\nhad been produced when he was in his cradle, in order to exalt his own\r\npupil Racine, whom he privately owned to be simply a very clever and\r\ndocile rhymester. He himself was very much the same with the exception\r\nof the docility. His good sense, his talents, his eye for the\r\nludicrous--except in his own work--were admirable, and the ill-nature of\r\nhis satires, with their frequent injustice and the strange ignorance\r\nthey display of all literature except the Latin classics and French and\r\nItalian contemporary authors, does not prevent their being excellent\r\nexamples of French and of the art of polite libelling. It is probable\r\nthat Boileau might have fared better but for his inconceivable folly in\r\nattempting, in the Namur ode, a style for which he had not the least\r\naptitude, and for the parrot-like monotony with which Frenchmen before\r\n1830, and even some of them since that date, have lauded and quoted him\r\nand accepted his dicta. But the most lenient estimate of him can hardly\r\namount to more than that he was an excellent writer of prose and\r\npedestrian verse, a critic of singular acuteness within a narrow range,\r\nand a satirist who had a keen eye for the ludicrous aspect of things and\r\npersons, and a remarkable skill at reproducing that aspect in words.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Poets of the later Seventeenth Century.]\r\n\r\nThe list of poets of the century has to be completed by some of more or\r\nless importance who flourished in the later days of Louis XIV., and, in\r\nsome few cases, outlived him. Brebeuf might have been mentioned before,\r\nas he was Boileau's elder, and, dying young, did not reach even the most\r\nbrilliant period of the reign. But he is unlike any of the three schools\r\nwho have been described, and his language is more modern than that of\r\nmost of the poets who wrote before or during the Fronde. His principal\r\nwork is a translation of the _Pharsalia_, in which both the defects and\r\nthe merits of the original are represented with remarkable fidelity.\r\nBoileau, who found fault with his _fatras obscur_, allowed him frequent\r\nflashes of genius, and these flashes are rather more frequent than might\r\nbe supposed, being also of a kind which Boileau was not usually inclined\r\nto recognise. Brebeuf is decidedly of what may be called the right\r\nschool of French poets, though he is one of the least of that school.\r\nHis minor poetry displays the same characteristics as his translation,\r\nbut is of less importance. Madame Deshoulieres, still more unjustly\r\ncriticised by Boileau, is unquestionably one of the chief poetesses of\r\nFrance; indeed, with Louise Labe and Marceline Desbordes Valmore, she is\r\nalmost the only one of importance. Her poems, like those of most of her\r\ncontemporaries, are of the occasional order, and have too much in them\r\nthat is artificial, but frequently also they have real pathos and\r\noccasionally not a little vigour. 'Le Songe' is a very admirable ode,\r\nhaving some of the characteristics of the English Caroline school.\r\nRacine himself, independently of his dramas, and the choruses inserted\r\nin them, wrote some poetry, chiefly religious, which has his usual\r\ncharacteristics of refinement in language and versification. Anthony\r\nHamilton has left some verses (notably an exquisite song, beginning\r\n'Celle qu'adore mon coeur n'est ni brune ni blonde') as dainty and\r\noriginal as his prose. At the end of the century two poets, whose names\r\nalways occur together in literary history, the Abbe de Chaulieu and the\r\nMarquis de la Fare, close the record. They were not only alike in their\r\nliterary work, but were personal friends, and not the worst of\r\nChaulieu's pieces is an elegy on La Fare, whom, though the older man of\r\nthe two, he survived. They were both members of the libertine society of\r\nthe Temple, over which the Duke de Vendome presided, and which, somewhat\r\nlater, formed Voltaire. The verses of both were strictly occasional.\r\nChaulieu, like many men of letters of the time, published nothing during\r\nhis long life, though his poems were known to French society in\r\nmanuscript. Besides the verses on La Fare, Chaulieu's best poem is,\r\nperhaps, that 'On a Country Life' (the author being an inveterate\r\ninhabitant of towns). La Fare, on the other hand, is best known by his\r\nstanzas to Chaulieu on 'La Paresse,' which he was well qualified to\r\nsing, inasmuch as it is said that during many years of his long life he\r\ndid nothing but sleep and eat. The verses of the two continued to be\r\nmodels of style, and (in a way) of choice of subject, during the whole\r\neighteenth century. Macaulay's rhetorical description of Frederic's\r\nverses, as 'hateful to gods and men, the faint echo of the lyre of\r\nChaulieu,' is not quite just in its suggestion. Chaulieu, and still\r\nmore La Fare, wrote very fair occasional poetry. One curious application\r\nof verse during this century requires mention in conclusion. This was\r\nthe Gazette, or rhymed news-letter, in which the gossip of the day, the\r\ndiversions of the court, etc., were recorded for the amusement and\r\ninstruction of great persons in the most pedestrian of octosyllables.\r\nThe chief writer of these trifles, which are very voluminous, and which\r\nhave preserved many curious particulars, was Loret, who was succeeded by\r\nRobinet, Boursault, Laurent, and others.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[224] Ed.

In non-dramatic poetry, the only name of the seventeenth\r\ncentury which can be said even to approach the first class is that of La\r\nFontaine, whose verse, except for its technical excellence, is almost as\r\nnear to prose as to poetry itself. But the names of Corneille, Racine,\r\nand Moliere stand in the highest rank of French authors, and their works\r\nwill remain the chief examples of the kind of drama which they\r\nprofessed. Nor is this difference in any way surprising. It has been\r\nalready shown that the style of drama introduced into France by the\r\nPleiade, and pursued with but little alteration afterwards, was a highly\r\nartificial and a highly limited kind. It lent itself successfully to\r\ncomparatively few situations; it excluded variety of action on the\r\nstage; it gave no opening for the display of complicated character. But\r\nthese very limitations made it susceptible of very high polish and\r\nelaboration within its own limited range, and made such polish and\r\nelaboration almost a necessity if it was to be tolerable at all. The\r\ncorrect and cold language and style which Malherbe preached; the\r\nregularity and harmony of versification on which he insisted; the strict\r\nattention to rule rather than impulse which he urged, all suited a thing\r\nin itself so artificial as the Senecan tragedy. They were not so\r\nsuitable to the more libertine genius of comedy. But here, fortunately\r\nfor France, the regulations were less rigid, and the abiding popularity\r\nof the indigenous farce gave a healthy corrective. The astonishing\r\ngenius of Moliere succeeded in combining the two influences--the lawless\r\nfreedom of the old farce, and the ordered decency of the Malherbian\r\npoetry. Even his theatre shows some sign of the taint with which\r\n'classical' drama is so deeply imbued, but its force and truth almost or\r\naltogether redeem the imperfections of its scheme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Montchrestien.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the early tragedy, which was more or less directly\r\nreproductive of Seneca, attained its highest pitch in the work of\r\nGarnier. This pitch was on the whole well maintained by Antoine de\r\nMontchrestien, a man of a singular history and of a singular genius. The\r\ndate of his birth is not exactly known, but he was the son of an\r\napothecary at Falaise, and belonged to the Huguenot party. Duels and\r\nlawsuits succeed each other in his story, and by some means or other he\r\nwas able to assume the title of Seigneur de Vasteville. In one of his\r\nduels he killed his man, and had to fly to England. Being pardoned, he\r\nreturned to France and took to commerce. But after the death of Henri\r\nIV. he joined a Huguenot rising, and was killed in October 1621.\r\nMontchrestien wrote a treatise on Political Economy (he is even said to\r\nhave been the first to introduce the term into French), some poems, and\r\nsix tragedies, _Sophonisbe_, or _La Cartaginoise_, _Les Lacenes_,\r\n_David_, _Aman_, _Hector_, and _L'Ecossaise_. Racine availed himself not\r\na little of _Aman_, but _L'Ecossaise_ is Montchrestien's best piece. In\r\nit he set the example to a long line of dramatists, from Vondel to Mr.\r\nSwinburne, who have since treated the story of Mary Queen of Scots. It\r\nis not part of the merit of Montchrestien to have improved on the\r\ntechnical defects of the Jodelle-Garnier model. His action is still\r\ndeficient, his speeches immoderately long. But his choric odes are of\r\ngreat beauty, and his _tirades_, disproportionate as they are, show a\r\nconsiderable advance in the power of indicating character as well as in\r\nstyle and versification. Beyond this, however, the force of the model\r\ncould no further go, and some alteration was necessary. Indeed it is by\r\nno means certain that the later plays of this class were ever acted at\r\nall, or were anything more than closet drama.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hardy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor predecessors of Corneille.]\r\n\r\nFor a not inconsiderable time the fate of French tragedy trembled in\r\nthe balance. During the first thirty years of the seventeenth century\r\nthe most prominent dramatist was Alexandre Hardy[233]. He is the first\r\nand not the least important example in French literary history of a\r\ndramatic author pure and simple, a playwright who was a playwright, and\r\nnothing else. Hardy was for years attached to the regular company of\r\nactors who had succeeded the _Confrerie_ at the Hotel de Bourgogne, and\r\nwrote or adapted pieces for them at the tariff (it is said) of fifty\r\ncrowns a play. His fertility was immense; and he is said to have written\r\nsome hundreds of plays. The exact number is variously stated at from\r\nfive to seven hundred. Forty-one exist in print. Although not destitute\r\nof original power, Hardy was driven to the already copious theatre of\r\nSpain for subjects and models. His plays being meant for acting and for\r\nnothing else, the scholarly but tedious exercitations of the Pleiade\r\nschool were out of the question. Yet, while he introduced a great deal\r\nof Spanish embroilment into his plots, and a great deal of Spanish\r\nbombast into his speeches, Hardy still accepted the general outline of\r\nthe classical tragedy, and, though utterly careless of unity of place\r\nand time, adhered for the most part to the perhaps more mischievous\r\nunity of action. His best play, _Mariamne_, is powerfully written, is\r\narranged with considerable skill, and contains some fine lines and even\r\nscenes; but, little as Hardy hampered himself with rules, it still has,\r\nto an English reader, a certain thinness of interest. A contemporary of\r\nHardy's, Jean de Schelandre, made, in a play[234] which does not seem\r\never to have been acted, a remarkable attempt at enfranchising French\r\ntragedy with the full privileges rather of the English than of the\r\nSpanish drama; but this play, _Tyr et Sidon_, had no imitators and no\r\ninfluence, and the general model remained unaltered. But during the\r\nfirst quarter of the century the theatre was exceedingly popular, and\r\nthe institution of strolling troops of actors spread its popularity all\r\nover France. Nearly a hundred names of dramatic writers of this time are\r\npreserved. Most of these, no doubt, were but retainers of the houses or\r\nthe troops, and did little but patch, adapt, and translate. But of the\r\nimmediate predecessors of Corneille, and his earlier contemporaries, at\r\nleast half-a-dozen are more or less known to fame, besides the really\r\ngreat name of Rotrou. Mairet, Tristan, Du Ryer, Scudery, Claveret, and\r\nD'Aubignac, were the chief of these. Mairet has been called the French\r\nMarston, and the resemblance is not confined to the fact that both wrote\r\ntragedies on the favourite subject of Sophonisba. The chief work of\r\nTristan, who was also a poet of some merit, was _Marianne_ (Mariamne),\r\nvery closely modelled on an Italian original, and much less vigorous,\r\nthough more polished than Hardy's play on the same subject. Du Ryer had\r\nneither Mairet's vigour nor Tristan's tenderness, but he made more\r\nprogress than either of them had done in the direction of the completed\r\ntragedy of Corneille and Racine. Scudery's _Amour Tyrannique_ is\r\nvigorous and bombastic. Claveret and D'Aubignac (the latter of whom was\r\nan active critic as well as a bad playwright) principally derive their\r\nreputation, such as it is, from the acerbity with which they attacked\r\nCorneille in the dispute about the Cid; nor should the name of Theophile\r\nde Viaud be passed over in this connection. His _Pyrame et Thisbe_ is\r\noften considered as almost the extreme example (though Corneille's\r\n_Clitandre_ is perhaps worse) of the conceited Spanish-French style in\r\ntragedy. The passage in which Thisbe accuses the poniard with which\r\nPyramus has stabbed himself of blushing at having sullied itself with\r\nthe blood of its master is a commonplace of quotation. Yet, like all\r\nTheophile's work, _Pyrame et Thisbe_ has value, and so has the\r\nunrepresented tragedy of _Pasiphae_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rotrou.]\r\n\r\nAmong these forgotten names, and others more absolutely forgotten still,\r\nthat of Rotrou[235] is pre-eminently distinguished. Jean de Rotrou (the\r\nparticle is not uniformly allowed him) was born at Dreux in 1609, and\r\nwas thus three years younger than Corneille. He went earlier to Paris,\r\nhowever, and at once betook himself to dramatic poetry, his\r\n_Hypocondriaque_ being represented before he was nineteen. He formed\r\nwith Corneille, Colletet, Bois-Robert, and L'Etoile, the band of\r\nRichelieu's 'Five Poets,' who composed tragedies jointly on the\r\nCardinal's plans[236]. He also worked unceasingly at the theatre on his\r\nown account. Thirty-five pieces are certainly, and five more doubtfully,\r\nattributed to him. For some time he had to work for bread, and the only\r\nweakness charged against him, a mania for gambling, left him poor, and\r\nperhaps prevented him from devoting to his work as much pains as he\r\nmight otherwise have given. After a time, however, he was pensioned, and\r\nappointed to various legal posts which members of his family had\r\npreviously held at Dreux. His fidelity to his official duty was the\r\ncause of his death. He was at Paris when a violent epidemic broke out at\r\nDreux. All who could left the town, and Rotrou was strongly dissuaded\r\nfrom returning. But he felt himself responsible for the maintenance of\r\norder, likely at such a time to be specially endangered. He returned at\r\nonce, caught the infection, and died. Rotrou's plays are too numerous\r\nfor a complete list of them to be here given, and by common consent two\r\nof them, _Le Veritable Saint Genest_ and _Venceslas_, greatly excel the\r\nrest, though vigorous verse and good scenes are to be found in almost\r\nall. These plays, it should be observed, were not written until after\r\nthe publication of Corneille's early masterpieces, though Rotrou had\r\nexhibited a play the year before the appearance of _Melite_. The two\r\npoets were friends, and though Corneille in a manner supplanted him,\r\nRotrou was unwavering throughout his life in expressions of admiration\r\nfor his great rival. Of the two plays just mentioned, _Venceslas_ is the\r\nmore regular, the better adapted to the canons of the French stage, and\r\nthe more even in its excellence. _Saint Genest_ is perhaps the more\r\ninteresting. The central idea is remarkable. Genest, an actor, performs\r\nbefore Diocletian a part in which he represents a Christian martyr. He\r\nis miraculously converted during the study of the piece, and at its\r\nperformance, after astonishing the audience by the fervour and vividness\r\nwith which he plays his part, boldly speaks in his own person, and,\r\navowing his conversion, is led off to prison and martyrdom. Many of the\r\nspeeches in this play are admirable poetry, and the plot is far from\r\nill-managed. The play within a play, of which _Hamlet_ and the _Taming\r\nof the Shrew_ are English examples, was, at this transition period, a\r\nfavourite stage incident in France. Corneille's _Illusion_ is the most\r\ncomplicated example of it, but _Saint Genest_ is by far the most\r\ninteresting and the best managed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corneille.]\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that though, as has been said, Rotrou's\r\nbest pieces were influenced by Corneille, the greater poet owed\r\nsomething at the beginning of his career to the example of his friend.\r\nPierre Corneille[237] was born at Rouen in 1606. His father, of the same\r\nname, was an official of rank in the legal hierarchy; his mother was\r\nnamed Marthe le Pesant. He was educated in the Jesuits' school, went to\r\nthe bar, and obtained certain small legal preferments which he\r\nafterwards sold. He practised, but 'sans gout et sans succes,' says\r\nFontenelle, his nephew and biographer. His first comedy, _Melite_, is\r\nsaid to have been suggested by a personal experience. It succeeded at\r\nRouen, and the author took it to Paris. His next attempt was a tragedy\r\nor a tragi-comedy, _Clitandre_, of a really marvellous extravagance. It\r\nwas followed by several other pieces, in all of which there is\r\nremarkable talent, though the author had not yet found his way. He found\r\nit at last in _Medee_, where the famous reply of the heroine 'Que vous\r\nreste-t-il?' 'Moi,' struck at once the note which no one but Corneille\r\nhimself and Victor Hugo has ever struck since, and which no one had ever\r\nstruck before. Corneille, as has been said above, was one of Richelieu's\r\nfive poets, but he was indocile to the Cardinal's caprices; and either\r\nthis indocility or jealousy set Richelieu against _Le Cid_. This great\r\nand famous play was suggested by, rather than copied from, the Spanish\r\nof Guillem de Castro. It excited an extraordinary turmoil among men of\r\nletters, but the public never went wrong about it from the first.\r\nBoileau's phrase--\r\n\r\n    Tout Paris pour Chimene a les yeux de Rodrigue,\r\n\r\nis as sound in fact as it is smart in expression. The _Cid_ appeared in\r\n1636, and for some years Corneille produced a succession of\r\nmasterpieces. _Horace_, _Cinna_, _Polyeucte_, _Le Menteur_ (a remarkable\r\ncomic effort, to which Moliere acknowledged his indebtedness), and\r\n_Rodogune_, in some respects the finest of all, succeeded each other at\r\nbut short intervals. Half-a-dozen plays, somewhat inferior in actual\r\nmerit, and which had the drawback of coming before a public used to the\r\nauthor and his method, followed, and the last and least good of them,\r\n_Pertharite_, was damned. Corneille, always the proudest of writers, was\r\ndeeply wounded by this ill-success, and publicly renounced the stage. He\r\ndevoted himself for some years to a strange task, the turning of the\r\n_Imitation_ of A'Kempis into verse. At last Fouquet, the Maecenas of the\r\nday, prevailed on him to begin again. He did so with _Oedipe_, which\r\nwas successful. It was followed by many other plays, which had varying\r\nfates. Racine, with a method refined upon Corneille's own, and a greater\r\nsympathy with the actual generation, became the rival of the elder poet,\r\nand Corneille did not obey the wise maxim, _solve senescentem_. Yet his\r\nlater plays have far more merit than is usually allowed to them.\r\n\r\nThe private life of Corneille was not unhappy, though his haughty and\r\nsensitive temperament brought him many vexations. His gains were small,\r\nnever exceeding two hundred louis for a play, and though this was\r\nsupplemented by occasional gifts from rich dedicatees and by a scanty\r\nprivate fortune, the total was insufficient. 'Je suis saoul de gloire et\r\naffame d'argent' is one of the numerous sayings of scornful discontent\r\nrecorded of him. He had a pension, but it was in his later days very ill\r\npaid. Nor was he one of the easy-going men of letters who console\r\nthemselves by Bohemian indulgence. In general society he was awkward,\r\nconstrained, and silent: but his home, which was long shared with his\r\nbrother Thomas--they married two sisters--seems to have been a happy\r\none. He retained till his death in 1684, if not the favour of the King\r\nand the general public, that of the persons whose favour was best worth\r\nhaving, such as Saint-Evremond and Madame de Sevigne, and his own\r\nconfidence in his genius never deserted him.\r\n\r\nCorneille's dramatic career may be divided into four parts; the first\r\nreaching from _Melite_ to _L'Illusion Comique_; the second (that of his\r\nmasterpieces), from the _Cid_ to _Rodogune_; the third, from _Theodore_\r\nto _Pertharite_; the fourth, that of the decadence, from _Oedipe_ to\r\n_Surena_. The following is a list of the names and dates (these latter\r\nbeing sometimes doubtful and contentious) of his plays. _Melite_, 1629,\r\na comedy improbable and confused in incident and overdone with verbal\r\n_pointes_, but much beyond anything previous to it. _Clitandre_, 1630, a\r\ntragedy in the taste of the time, one of the maddest of plays. _La\r\nVeuve_, 1634, a comedy, well written and lively. _La Galerie du Palais_\r\n(same year), a capital comedy of its immature kind, bringing in the\r\nhumours of contemporary Paris. _La Suivante_, a comedy (same year), in\r\nwhich the great character of the soubrette makes her first appearance.\r\n_La Place Royale_, a comedy, 1635, duller than the _Galerie du Palais_,\r\nwhich it in some respects resembles. _Medee_, a tragedy (same year),\r\nincomparably the best French tragedy up to its date. _L'Illusion\r\nComique_, 1636, a tragi-comedy of the extremest Spanish type,\r\ncomplicated and improbable to a degree in its action, which turns on the\r\nmotive of a play within a play, and produces, as the author himself\r\nremarks, a division into prologue (Act i), an imperfect comedy (Acts\r\nii-iv), and a tragedy (Act v). _Le Cid_, 1636, the best-known if not the\r\nbest of Corneille's plays, and, from the mere playwright's point of\r\nview, the most attractive. _Horace_, 1639, often, but improperly, called\r\n_Les Horaces_, in which the Cornelian method is seen complete. The final\r\nspeech of Camille before her brother kills her was as a whole never\r\nexceeded by the author, and the 'qu'il mourut' of the elder Horace is\r\nequally characteristic. _Cinna_, 1639, the general favourite in France,\r\nbut somewhat stilted and devoid of action to foreign taste. _Polyeucte_,\r\n1640, the greatest of all Christian tragedies. _La Mort de Pompee_,\r\n1641, full of stately verse, but heavy and somewhat grandiose. _Le\r\nMenteur_, 1642, a charming comedy, followed by a _Suite du Menteur_,\r\n1643, not inferior, though the fickleness of public taste disapproved\r\nit. _Theodore_, 1645, a noble tragedy, which only failed because the\r\nprudery of theatrical precisians found fault with its theme--the\r\nsubjection of a Christian virgin to the last and worst trial of her\r\nhonour and faith. _Rodogune_, 1646, the _chef-d'oeuvre_ of the style,\r\ndisplaying from beginning to end an astonishing power of moving\r\nadmiration and terror. This play marks the climax of Corneille's\r\nfaculty. In _Heraclius_, 1647, no real falling-off is visible; indeed,\r\nthe character of Phocas stands almost alone on the French stage as a\r\nparallel in some sort to Iago. _Andromede_, 1650, introduced a\r\nconsiderable amount of spectacle and decoration, not unhappily. _Don\r\nSanche d'Aragon_, 1651, _Nicomede_, 1652, and _Pertharite_, 1653 (each\r\nof which may possibly be a year older than these respective dates), show\r\nwhat political economists might call the stationary state of the poet's\r\ngenius. The first two plays produced after the interval, _Oedipe_,\r\n1659, and _La Toison d'Or_, 1660, both show the benefit of the rest the\r\npoet had had, together with certain signs of advancing years. _La Toison\r\nd'Or_, like _Andromede_, includes a great deal of spectacle, and is\r\nrather an elaborate masque interspersed with regular dramatic scenes\r\nthan a tragedy. It is one of the best specimens of the kind. In\r\n_Sertorius_, 1662, there are occasional passages of much grandeur and\r\nbeauty, but _Sophonisbe_, 1663, is hardly a success, nor is _Othon_,\r\n1664. _Agesilas_, 1666, and _Attila_, 1667, have been (the latter\r\nunfairly) damned by a quatrain of Boileau's. But _Tite et Berenice_,\r\n1670, must be acknowledged to be inferior to the play of Racine in\r\nrivalry with which it was produced. _Pulcherie_, 1672, and _Surena_,\r\n1674, are last-fruits off an old tree, which, especially the second, are\r\nnot unworthy of it. Nor was Corneille's contribution to the remarkable\r\nopera of _Psyche_, 1671, inconsiderable. This completes his dramatic\r\nwork, which amounts to thirty pieces and part of another. It should be\r\nadded that, to all the plays up to _La Toison d'Or_, he subjoined in a\r\ncollected edition very remarkable criticisms of them, which he calls\r\n_Examens_.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of this great dramatist are perhaps more uniform\r\nthan those of any writer of equal rank, and there can be little doubt\r\nthat this uniformity, which, considering the great bulk of his work,\r\namounts almost to monotony, was the cause of his gradual loss of\r\npopularity. We shall not here notice the points which he has in common\r\nwith Racine, as a writer of the French classical drama. These will come\r\nin more suitably when Racine himself has been dealt with. In Corneille\r\nthe academic criticism of the time found the fault that he rather\r\nexcited admiration than pity and terror, and it held that admiration\r\nwas 'not a tragic passion.' The criticism was clumsy, and to a great\r\nextent futile, but it has a certain basis of truth. It is comparatively\r\nrare for Corneille to attempt, after his earliest period, to interest\r\nhis hearers or readers in the fortunes of his characters. It is rather\r\nin the way that they bear their fortunes, and particularly in a kind of\r\nhaughty disdain for fortune itself, that these characters impress us.\r\nSometimes, as in the Cleopatre of _Rodogune_, this masterful temper is\r\nengaged on the side of evil, more frequently it is combined with amiable\r\nor at least respectable characteristics. But there is always something\r\n'remote and afar' about it, and the application by La Bruyere of the\r\nfamous comparison between the Greek tragedians is in the main strictly\r\naccurate. It follows that Corneille's demand upon his hearers or readers\r\nis a somewhat severe one, and one with which many men are neither\r\ndisposed nor able to comply. It was a greater misfortune for him than\r\nfor almost any one else that the French and not the English drama was\r\nthe Sparta which it fell to his lot to decorate. His powers were not in\r\nreality limited. The _Menteur_ shows an excellent comic faculty, and the\r\nstrokes of irony in his serious plays have more of true humour in them\r\nthan appears in almost any other French dramatist. Had the licence of\r\nthe English stage been his, he would probably have been able to impart a\r\ngreater interest to his plays than they already possess, without\r\nsacrificing his peculiar faculty of sublime moral portraiture, and\r\ncertainly without losing the credit of the magnificent single lines and\r\nisolated passages which abound in his work. The friendly criticism of\r\nMoliere on these sudden flashes is well known. 'My friend Corneille,' he\r\nsaid, 'has a familiar who comes now and then and whispers in his ear the\r\nfinest verses in the world, but sometimes the familiar deserts him, and\r\nthen he writes no better than anybody else.' The most fertile familiar\r\ncannot suggest fifty or sixty thousand of these finest lines in the\r\nworld; and the consequence is that, what with the lack of central\r\ninterest which follows from Corneille's own plan, with the absence of\r\nsubsidiary interest and relief which is inevitable in the French\r\nclassical model, and with the drawbacks of his somewhat declamatory\r\nstyle, there are long passages, sometimes whole scenes and acts, if not\r\nwhole plays of his, which are but dreary reading, and could hardly be,\r\neven with the most appreciative and creative acting, other than dreary\r\nto witness. It was Corneille's fault that, while bowing himself to the\r\nyoke of the Senecan drama, he did not perceive or would not accept the\r\nfact that there is practically but one situation, by the working out of\r\nwhich that drama can be made tolerable to modern audiences. This\r\nsituation is love-making, which in real life necessitates a vast deal of\r\ntalking, and about which, even on the stage, a vast deal of talking is\r\nadmissible. The characters of the French classic or heroic play are\r\npractically allowed to do nothing but talk, and the author who would\r\nmake them interesting must submit himself to his fate. Corneille would\r\nnot submit wholly and cheerfully, though he has, as might be expected,\r\nbeen obliged to introduce love-making into most of his plays.\r\n\r\nTo a modern reader the detached passages already referred to, and the\r\nmagnificent versification which is displayed in them, make up the real\r\ncharm of Corneille except in a very few plays, such as the _Cid_,\r\n_Polyeucte_, _Rodogune_, and perhaps a few others. Du Bartas, D'Aubigne,\r\nand Regnier, had indicated the capacities of the Alexandrine; Corneille\r\ndemonstrated them and illustrated them almost indefinitely. He did not\r\nindulge in the pedantry of _rimes difficiles_, by which Racine attracted\r\nhis hearers, nor was his verse so uniformly smooth as that of his\r\nyounger rival. But what it lacked in polish and grace it more than made\r\nup in grandeur and dignity. The best lines of Corneille, like those of\r\nD'Aubigne, of Rotrou, from whom, comparatively stammering as was the\r\nteacher, Corneille perhaps learnt the art, and of Victor Hugo, have a\r\npeculiar crash of sound which hardly any other metre of any other\r\nlanguage possesses. A slight touch of archaism (it is very slight) which\r\nis to be discovered in his work assists its effect not a little. The\r\ninveterate habit which exists in England of comparing all dramatists\r\nwith Shakespeare has been prejudicial to the fame of Corneille with us.\r\nBut he is certainly the greatest tragic dramatist of France on the\r\nclassical model, and as a fashioner of dramatic verse of a truly\r\npoetical kind he has at his best few equals in the literature of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Racine.]\r\n\r\nThe character, career, and work of Racine were curiously different from\r\nthose of Corneille. Jean Racine[238] was more than thirty years younger\r\nthan his greater rival, having been born at La Ferte Milon, at no great\r\ndistance from Soissons, in 1639. His father held an official position at\r\nthis place, but he died, as Racine's mother had previously died, in the\r\nboy's infancy, leaving him without any fortune. His grandparents,\r\nhowever, were alive, and able to take care of him, and they, with other\r\nrelatives, willingly undertook the task. He was well educated, going to\r\nschool at Beauvais, from 1650 (probably) to 1655, and then spending\r\nthree years under the care of the celebrated Port Royalists, where he\r\nmade considerable progress. A year at the College d'Harcourt, where he\r\nshould have studied law, completed his regular education; but he was\r\nalways studious, and had on the whole greater advantages of culture than\r\nmost men of letters of his time and country. For some years he led a\r\nsomewhat undecided life. His relations did their best to obtain a\r\nbenefice for him, and in other ways endeavoured to put him in the way of\r\na professional livelihood; but ill-luck and probably disinclination on\r\nhis part stood in the way. He wrote at least two plays at a\r\ncomparatively early age which were refused, and are not known to exist,\r\nand he produced divers pieces of miscellaneous poetry, especially the\r\n'Nymphe de la Seine,' which brought him to the notice of Chapelain. At\r\nlast, in 1664, he obtained a pension of six hundred livres for an ode on\r\nthe king's recovery from sickness, and the same year _La Thebaide_ was\r\naccepted and produced. For the next thirteen years plays followed in\r\nrapid, but not too rapid succession. Racine was the favourite of the\r\nking, and consequently of all those who had no taste of their own, as\r\nwell as of some who had, though the best critics inclined to Corneille,\r\nbetween whom and Racine rivalry was industriously fostered. The somewhat\r\nindecent antagonism which Racine had shown towards a man who had won\r\nrenown ten years before his own birth was justly punished in his own\r\ntemporary eclipse by the almost worthless Pradon. He withdrew disgusted\r\nfrom the stage in 1677. About the same time he married, was made\r\nhistoriographer to the king, and became more or less fervently devout.\r\nYears afterwards, at the request of Madame de Maintenon, he wrote for\r\nher school-girls at St. Cyr the dramatic sketch of _Esther_, and soon\r\nafterwards the complete tragedy of _Athalie_, the greatest of his works.\r\nThen he relapsed into silence as far as dramatic utterance was\r\nconcerned. He died in 1699. Thus he presented the singular spectacle,\r\nonly paralleled by our own Congreve, and that not exactly, of a short\r\nperiod of consummate activity followed by almost complete inaction. That\r\nthis inaction was not due to exhaustion of genius was abundantly shown\r\nby _Esther_ and _Athalie_. But Racine was of a peculiar and in many ways\r\nan unamiable temper. He was very jealous of his reputation, acutely\r\nsensitive to criticism, and envious to the last degree of any public\r\napprobation bestowed on others. Having made his fame, he seems to have\r\npreferred, in the language of the French gaming table, _faire\r\nCharlemagne_, and to run no further risks. He had, however, worse\r\nfailings than any yet mentioned. Moliere gave him valuable assistance,\r\nand he repaid it with ingratitude. With hardly a shadow of provocation\r\nhe attacked in a tone of the utmost acrimony the Port Royal fathers, to\r\nwhom he was under deep obligations. The charge of hypocrisy in religious\r\nmatters which has been brought against him is probably gratuitous, and,\r\nin any case, does not concern us here. But his character in his literary\r\nrelations is far from being a pleasant one.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of Racine's theatrical pieces. _La Thebaide_,\r\n1664, indicates with sufficient clearness the lines upon which all\r\nRacine's plays, save the two last, were to be constructed--a minute\r\nadherence to the rules, very careful versification and subordination of\r\nalmost all other interests to stately gallantry--but it is altogether\r\ninferior to its successors. In _Alexandre le Grand_, 1665, the\r\ncharacteristics are accentuated, and what Corneille disdainfully\r\ncalled--\r\n\r\n    Le commerce rampant de soupirs et de flammes\r\n\r\nis more than ever prominent. In _Andromaque_, 1667, an immense advance\r\nis perceptible. The characters become personally interesting (Hermione\r\nis perhaps more attractive than any of Corneille's women), and a power\r\nof passionate invective not unworthy to be compared with Corneille's,\r\nbut with more of a feminine character about it, appears. This was\r\nfollowed by Racine's only attempt in the comic sock, _Les Plaideurs_,\r\n1668, a most charming trifle which has had, and has deserved, more\r\ngenuine and lasting popularity than any of his tragedies. He returned to\r\ntragedy, and rapidly showed the defects of the stereotyped mannerism\r\ninevitably imposed on him by his plan. _Britannicus_, 1669, _Berenice_,\r\n1670, _Bajazet_, 1672, and _Mithridate_, 1673, with all their perfection\r\nof _technique_, announce, as clearly as anything can well do, the fatal\r\nmonotony into which French tragedy had once more fallen, and in which it\r\nwas to continue for a century and a half. _Iphigenie_, 1674, has much\r\nmore liveliness and variety, the deep pathos and terror of the situation\r\nmaking even Racine's interminable love casuistry natural and\r\ninteresting. But _Phedre_, 1677, the last of the series, is\r\nunquestionably the most remarkable of Racine's regular tragedies. By it\r\nthe style must stand or fall, and a reader need hardly go farther to\r\nappreciate it. _Britannicus_ was indeed preferred by eighteenth-century\r\njudges; but for excellence of construction, artful beauty of verse,\r\nskilful use of the limited means of appeal at the command of the\r\ndramatist, no play can surpass _Phedre_; and if it still is found\r\nwanting, as it undoubtedly is by the vast majority of critics (including\r\nnowadays a powerful minority even among Frenchmen themselves), the fault\r\nlies rather in the style than in the author, or at least in the author\r\nfor adopting the style. _Esther_, 1689, and _Athalie_, 1691, on the\r\nother hand, while retaining a certain similarity of form and machinery,\r\nare radically different from the other plays. It is evident that Racine\r\nbefore writing them had attentively studied the sixteenth-century drama,\r\nto the strict form of which with its choruses he returns, and from which\r\nhe borrows, in some cases directly, the _Aman_ of Montchrestien having\r\nclearly suggested passages in _Esther_. His great poetical faculty has\r\nfreer play; he escapes the monotonous 'soupirs et flammes' altogether,\r\nand the result is in _Esther_ on the whole, in _Athalie_ wholly,\r\nadmirable.\r\n\r\nRacine's peculiarities as a dramatist have been already indicated, but\r\nmay now be more fully described. He was emphatically one of those\r\nwriters--Virgil and Pope are the other chief notable representatives of\r\nthe class--who, with an incapacity for the finest original strokes of\r\npoetry, have an almost unlimited capacity for writing from models, for\r\nimproving the technical execution of their poems, and for adjusting the\r\nconception of their pieces to their powers of rendering. These writers\r\nare always impossible without forerunners, and not usually possible\r\nwithout critics of the pedagogic kind. Racine was extraordinarily\r\nfortunate in his forerunner, and still more fortunate in his critic. He\r\nwas able to start with all the advantages which thirty years of work on\r\nthe part of his rival, Corneille, gave him; and he had for his trainer,\r\nBoileau, one of the most capable, if one of the most limited and\r\nprejudiced, of literary schoolmasters. Boileau was no respecter of\r\npersons, and arrogant as he was, he was rather an admirer of Racine than\r\nof Corneille; yet, according to a well-known story, he distinguished\r\nbetween the two by saying that Corneille was a great poet, and Racine a\r\nvery clever man, to whom he himself had taught the knack of easy\r\nversification with elaborate rhyming. It is indeed in his versification\r\nthat both the strength and the weakness of Racine lie, and in this\r\nrespect he is an exact analogue to the poets mentioned above. He treated\r\nthe Alexandrine of Corneille exactly as Pope treated the decasyllable of\r\nDryden, and as Virgil treated the hexameter of Lucretius. In his hands\r\nit acquired smoothness, softness, polish, and mechanical perfections of\r\nmany kinds, only to suffer at the same time a compensatory monotony\r\nwhich, when the honied sweetness of it began to cloy, was soon\r\nrecognised as a terrible drawback. The extraordinary estimation in which\r\nRacine is held by those who abide by the classical tradition in France\r\ndepends very mainly on the melody of his versification and rhymes, but\r\nit does not depend wholly upon this. There must also be taken into\r\naccount the perfection of workmanship with which he carries out the idea\r\nof the drama which he practised. What that ideal was must therefore be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the object of the French drama of Racine's\r\ntime was not in the least to hold the mirror up to nature. The model\r\nwhich, owing to admiration of the classics, the Pleiade had almost at\r\nhaphazard followed, rendered such an object simply unattainable. The\r\nso-called irregularity of the English stage, which used to fill French\r\ncritics with alternate wonder and disgust, is nothing but the result of\r\nan unflinching adherence to this standard. It is impossible to reproduce\r\nthe _subtilitas naturae_ in its most subtle example--the character of\r\nman--without introducing a large diversity of circumstance and action.\r\nThat diversity in its turn cannot be produced without a great\r\nmultiplication of characters, a duplication or triplication of plot, and\r\na complete disregard of pre-established 'common form.' Now this 'common\r\nform' was the essence of French tragedy. Following, or thinking that\r\nthey followed, the ancients, French dramatists and dramatic critics\r\nadopted certain fixed rules according to which a poet had to write just\r\nas a whist-player has to play the game. There was to be no action on the\r\nstage, or next to none, the interest of the play was to be rigidly\r\nreduced to a central situation, subsidiary characters were to be avoided\r\nas far as possible, the only means afforded to the personages of\r\nexplaining themselves was by dialogue with confidantes--the curse of the\r\nFrench stage--and the only way of informing the audience of the progress\r\nof the action was by messengers. Corneille accepted these limitations\r\npartially, and without too much good-will, but he evaded the difficulty\r\nby emphasising the moral lesson. The ethical standard of his plays is\r\nperhaps higher on the whole than that of any great dramatist, and the\r\nwonderful bursts of poetry which he could command served to sugar the\r\npill. But Racine was not a man of high moral character, and he was a man\r\nof great shrewdness and discernment. He evidently distrusted the\r\nwillingness of audiences perpetually to admire moral grandeur, whether\r\nhe did or did not hold that admiration was not a tragic passion.\r\nProbably he would have put it that it was not a passion that would draw.\r\nLove-making, on the contrary, would draw, and love-making accordingly is\r\nthe staple of all his plays. But the defect which has attended all\r\nFrench literature, which was aggravated enormously by this style of\r\ndrama, and which is noticeable even in his greater contemporaries,\r\nCorneille and Moliere, manifested itself in his work almost inevitably.\r\nIf there is one fault to be found with the creations of French literary\r\nart, it is that they run too much into types. It has been well said that\r\nthe duty of art is to give the universal in the particular. But to do\r\nthis exactly is difficult. It is the fault of English and of German\r\nliterature to give the particular without a sufficient tincture of the\r\nuniversal, to lose themselves in mere 'humours.' It is the fault of\r\nFrench literature to give the type only without differentiation. An\r\nill-natured critic constantly feels inclined to alter the lists of\r\nRacine's dramatis personae, and instead of the proper names to\r\nsubstitute 'a lover,' 'a mother,' 'a tyrant,' and so forth. So great an\r\nartist and so careful a worker as Racine could not, of course, escape\r\ngiving some individuality to his creations. Hermione, Phedre, Achille,\r\nBerenice, Athalie, are all individual enough of their class. But the\r\nclass is the class of types rather than of individuals. After long\r\ndebate this difference has been admitted by most reasonable French\r\ncritics, and they now confine themselves to the argument that the two\r\nprocesses, the illustration of the universal by means of the particular,\r\nand the indication of the particular by means of the universal, are\r\nprocesses equally legitimate and equally important. The difficulty\r\nremains that, by common consent of mankind--Frenchmen not\r\nexcluded--Hamlet, Othello, Falstaff, Rosalind, are fictitious persons\r\nfar more interesting to their fellow-creatures who are not fictitious\r\nthan any personages of the French stage. There is, moreover, a simple\r\ntest which can be applied. No one can doubt that, if Shakespeare had\r\nchosen to adopt the style, and had accepted the censorship of a Boileau,\r\nhe could easily have written _Phedre_. It would be a bold man who should\r\nsay that Racine could, with altered circumstances but unaltered powers,\r\nhave written _Othello_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Tragedians.]\r\n\r\nThe style of tragedy which was likely to be successful in France had\r\nbeen pointed out so clearly by Corneille and by Racine that it could not\r\nfail to find imitators. As usual, the weakness of the style was more\r\nfully manifested by these imitators than its strength. The best of them\r\nwas Thomas Corneille, the younger brother of Pierre. A much more facile\r\nversifier than his brother, he produced a large number of plays, of\r\nwhich _Camma_, _Laodice_, _Ariane_, _Le Comte d'Essex_, have\r\nconsiderable merit. Thomas Corneille succeeded his brother in the\r\nAcademy, and died at a great old age. He was an active journalist and\r\nmiscellaneous writer as well as a dramatist, and his principal\r\nmisfortune was that he had a brother of greater genius than himself.\r\nPradon, whose success against _Phedre_ so bitterly annoyed Racine, was a\r\ndramatist of the third, or even the fourth class, though he enjoyed some\r\ntemporary popularity. Campistron, a follower rather than a rival of\r\nRacine, was a better writer than Pradon, but pushed to an extreme the\r\nsoftness and almost effeminacy of subject and treatment which made\r\nCorneille contemptuously speak of his younger rival and his party as\r\n'les doucereux.' Quinault, before writing good operas and fair comedies,\r\nwrote bad tragedies. The only other authors of the day worth mentioning\r\nare Duche and Lafosse. Lafosse is a man of one play, though as a matter\r\nof fact he wrote four. In _Manlius_ he gave Roman names and setting to\r\nthe plot of Otway's _Venice Preserved_, and achieved a decided success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of Comedy.]\r\n\r\nThe history of French comedy is remarkably different from that of French\r\ntragedy. In the latter case a foreign model was followed almost\r\nslavishly; in the former the actual possessions of the language received\r\ngrafts of foreign importation, and the result was one of the capital\r\nproductions of European literature. Whether the popularity of the\r\nindigenous farce of itself saved France from falling into the same false\r\ngroove with Italy it is not easy to say, but it is certain that at the\r\ntime of the Renaissance there was some danger. At first it seemed as if\r\nTerence was to serve as a model for comedy just as Seneca served as a\r\nmodel for tragedy. The first comedy, _Eugene_, is strongly Terentian,\r\nthough even here a greater freedom of movement, a stronger infusion of\r\nlocal colour is observable than in _Didon_ or _Cleopatre_. So, too, when\r\nthe Italian Larivey adapted his remarkable comedies the vernacular\r\nsavour became still stronger. Yet it was very long before genuine comedy\r\nwas produced in France. The farces continued, and kinds of dramatic\r\nentertainment, lower even than the farce, such as those which survive in\r\nthe work of the merry-andrew Tabarin[239], were relished. The Spanish\r\ncomedy, with its strong spice of tragi-comedy, was imitated to a\r\nconsiderable extent. A few examples of the _Commedia erudita_, or\r\nTerentian play, continued to be produced at intervals; and the stock\r\npersonages of the _Commedia dell'arte_, Harlequin, Scaramouch, etc., at\r\none time invaded France, and, under cover of the comic opera and the\r\n_Foire_ pieces, made something of a lodgment. In the earlier years of\r\nthe seventeenth century, moreover, a considerable number of fantastic\r\nexperiments were tried. We have a _Comedie des Proverbes_, in which the\r\naction is altogether subordinate to the introduction of the greatest\r\npossible number of popular sayings; a _Comedie des Chansons_ spun out of\r\na vast and precious collection of popular songs; a _Comedie des\r\nComedies_, which is a cento made up of extracts from Balzac, the\r\nmoralist and letter-writer; a _Comedie des Comediens_, in which the\r\nfamous actors of the day are brought on the stage in their own\r\npersons[240], etc., etc. While French comedy was thus endeavouring to\r\nfind its way in all manner of tentative and sometimes grotesque\r\nexperiments, dramatists of talent occasionally struck, as if by\r\naccident, into some of the side paths of that way, and directed their\r\nsuccessors into the way itself. The early comedies of Corneille have\r\nbeen spoken of; despite the improbability of their Spanish plots, they\r\nshow a distinct feeling after real excellence. The eccentric Cyrano de\r\nBergerac, especially in his _Pedant Joue_, furnished Moliere with hints,\r\nand displayed considerable comic power. Scarron, a not dissimilar\r\nperson, whose _Roman Comique_ shows the interest he felt in the theatre,\r\nalso wrote comedies, the chief of which were extremely popular, the\r\ncharacter of Jodelet in the play of the same name (1645) becoming for\r\nthe time a stock one both in name and type. Scarron's other chief pieces\r\nwere _Don Japhet d'Armenie_, _L'Heritier ridicule_, _La Precaution\r\ninutile_. It was in the _Menteur_ of Corneille that Moliere himself\r\nconsidered that true comedy had been first reached, and it was this play\r\nwhich set him on the track. But French comedy of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, before Moliere, is one of the subjects which have hardly any\r\nbut a historical and antiquarian interest. Although far less artificial\r\nthan contemporary tragedy, it is inferior as literature. It was\r\nattempted by writers of less power, and it is disfigured by too frequent\r\ncoarseness of language and incident. It was on the whole the lowest of\r\nliterary styles during the first half of the century. With Moliere it\r\nbecame at one bound the highest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moliere.]\r\n\r\nJean Baptiste Poquelin[241], afterwards called Moliere, was born at\r\nParis, probably in January 1622, in the Rue St. Honore. The Poquelin\r\nfamily seem to have come from Beauvais. Some hypotheses as to a Scotch\r\norigin have been disproved. Moliere's father was an upholsterer, holding\r\nan appointment in the royal household, and of some wealth and position.\r\nMoliere himself had every advantage of education, being at school at the\r\nfamous Jesuit College de Clermont, and afterwards studying philosophy\r\n(under Gassendi) and law. He was, according to some accounts, actually\r\ncalled to the bar. At his majority he seems to have received a\r\nconsiderable share of his mother's fortune, and thus to have become\r\nindependent. He joined some other young men of fair position in\r\nestablishing a theatrical company called _L'Illustre Theatre_, which,\r\nhowever, failed with heavy loss to him, notwithstanding the assistance\r\nof a family of professional actors and actresses, one of whom, Madeleine\r\nBejart, figures prominently in his private history. He was not to be\r\nthus disgusted with his profession. In 1646 he set out on a strolling\r\ntour through the provinces, and was absent from the capital for nearly\r\nthirteen years. The notices of this interesting part of his career which\r\nexist are unfortunately few, and, like many other points connected with\r\nit, have given rise to much controversy. It is sufficient to say that he\r\nreturned to Paris in 1658, and on the 24th of October performed with his\r\ntroupe before the court. He had long been a dramatist as well as an\r\nactor, and had written besides minor pieces, most of which are lost, the\r\n_Etourdi_ and the _Depit Amoureux_. Moliere soon acquired the favour of\r\nthe king, and the _Precieuses Ridicules_, the first of his really great\r\nworks, gained for him that of the public. In 1662 he married Armande\r\nBejart, the younger sister of Madeleine--a marriage which brought him\r\ngreat unhappiness, though it was probably not without influence on some\r\nof his finest work. The king was godfather to the first child of the\r\nmarriage, and Moliere was a prosperous man. He became valet-de-chambre\r\nto Louis, and it was some insolence of his noble colleagues which is\r\nalleged, in a late and improbable though famous story, to have\r\noccasioned the incident of his partaking of the king's _en cas de nuit_.\r\nThe highest point of his genius was shortly reached; _Tartuffe_, the\r\n_Festin de Pierre_, and _Le Misanthrope_ being the work of three\r\nsuccessive years, 1664-6. _Tartuffe_ brought him some trouble because it\r\nwas supposed to be irreligious in tendency, or at least to satirise the\r\nprofession of religion. These, his three greatest comedies, were not all\r\nwarmly received, and he fell back upon lighter work, producing in rapid\r\nsuccession farce-comedies for the public theatre, and _divertissements_\r\nof divers kinds for the court until his death in February 1673, which\r\nhappened almost on the stage.\r\n\r\nThe following is a complete list of Moliere's work which has come down\r\nto us. During his provincial sojourn he had written many slight pieces\r\nhalf-way in kind between the Italian comedy and the native farce. Of\r\nthese two only survive, _Le Medecin Volant_ and _La Jalousie du\r\nBarbouille_. Both have considerable merit, and Moliere subsequently\r\nworked up their materials, as no doubt he did those of the lost pieces.\r\n_L'Etourdi_, 1653, is a regular comedy in five acts, still strongly\r\nItalian in style and somewhat improbable in circumstances, but full of\r\nsparkle and lively action and dialogue. _Le Depit Amoureux_, 1654, is\r\neven better and more independent. Nothing had yet been seen on the\r\nFrench stage so good as the quarrels and reconciliation of the quartette\r\nof master, mistress, valet, and _soubrette_. But _Les Precieuses\r\nRidicules_, 1659, struck an entirely different note. The stage had been\r\nemployed often enough for personal satire, but it had not yet been made\r\nuse of for the actual delineation and criticism of contemporary manners\r\nas manners and not as the foibles of individuals. The play was directed\r\nagainst the affectations and unreal language of the members of literary\r\n_coteries_ which, with that of the Hotel Rambouillet as the chief, had\r\nlong been prominent in French society. It has but a single act, but in\r\nits way it has never been surpassed either as a piece of social satire\r\nor a piece of brilliant dialogue illustrating ludicrous action and\r\ncharacter. _Sganarelle_, 1660, relapses into the commonplaces of farce,\r\nand has no moral or satirical intention, but is amusing enough. _Don\r\nGarcie de Navarre_, 1661, may be called Moliere's only failure. He\r\nstyles it a _comedie heroique_, and it is in fact a kind of anticipation\r\nof Racine's manner, but applied to less serious subjects. The jealousy\r\nof the hero is, however, the only motive of the piece, and its\r\nexhibition is rather tiresome than anything else. The play is monotonous\r\nand unrelieved by action. The genius of the author reappeared in its\r\nappropriate sphere in _L'Ecole des Maris_ (same date), where a Terentian\r\nsuggestion is adapted and carried out with the greatest skill. Then,\r\nstill in the same prolific year, Moliere returned to social satire in\r\n_Les Facheux_, an audacious lampoon on the forms of fashionable boredom\r\ncommon among the courtiers of the time. In 1662 appeared _L'Ecole des\r\nFemmes_, which is generally considered the best of Moliere's plays\r\nbefore _Tartuffe_. A certain slyness about the character of Agnes is its\r\nonly drawback. This gave occasion to the brilliant and most amusing\r\n_Critique de L'Ecole des Femmes_, 1663. Here the author is once more the\r\nsatirist of contemporary society, which he introduces as criticising his\r\nown work. _L'Impromptu de Versailles_ (same date), according to a\r\ncurious habit which Moliere did not originate, brings the author himself\r\nand his troupe in their own names and persons before the spectator. _Le\r\nMariage Force_, 1664, a slight piece, was worked up into a ballet for\r\nthe court. _La Princesse d'Elide_ (same date) is Moliere's most\r\nimportant court piece, or _comedie-ballet_, and, though necessarily\r\nartificial, has great beauty. Next in point of composition came _The\r\nHypocrite_, that is to say _Tartuffe_, but the difficulties which this\r\nmet with made _Le Festin de Pierre_, 1665, appear first. This is a\r\ntragi-comic working up of the Don Juan story, and is of a different\r\nclass from any other of Moliere's comedies. It has been thought, but\r\nwithout sufficient ground, that Moliere here gave expression to a\r\nmodified form of the freethinking which was so common at the time. It\r\nmay, perhaps, be more truly regarded as an excursion into romantic\r\ncomedy--the comedy which, like Shakespeare's work, is not directly\r\nsatiric on society or on individuals, but tells stories poetically and\r\nin dramatic form with comic touches. It is noteworthy that Don Juan is\r\nof all Moliere's heroes least exposed to the charge of being an\r\nabstraction rather than a man. The pleasant trifle, _L'Amour Medecin_\r\n(same date), was succeeded by _Le Misanthrope_, 1666. Here Moliere's\r\nspecial vein of satire was worked most deeply and to most profit, though\r\nthe reproach that the handling is somewhat too serious for comedy is not\r\nundeserved. Alceste the impatient but not cynical hero, Celimene the\r\ncoquette, Oronte the fop, Eliante the reasonable woman, Arsinoe the\r\nmischief-maker, are all immortal types. The admirable farce-comedy of\r\nthe _Medecin malgre Lui_ (same date), founded upon an old _fabliau_,\r\nfollowed, and this was succeeded almost immediately by the graceful\r\npastoral of _Melicerte_, the amusing _Pastorale Comique_, and the slight\r\nsketch of _Le Sicilien, ou L'Amour Peintre_. At last, in 1667,\r\n_Tartuffe_ got itself represented. It is a vigorous and almost ferocious\r\nsatire on religious pretension masking vice, and many of its separate\r\nstrokes are of the dramatist's happiest. Here however, more than\r\nelsewhere, is felt the drawback of the method. Comparing Tartuffe with\r\nIago, we have all the difference between a skilful but not wholly\r\nprobable presentation of wickedness in the abstract, and a picture of a\r\nwicked man. In _Amphitryon_, 1668, Moliere measured himself with Plautus\r\nand produced an admirable play. _George Dandin_ (same date), the working\r\nup of _La Jalousie du Barbouille_, is one of the happiest of his\r\nsketches of conjugal infelicity. Then came _L'Avare_ (same date), in\r\nwhich Moliere was once more indebted to the ancients and to his French\r\npredecessors, but in which he amply justified his borrowings. At this\r\ntime he extended his field and brought his knowledge of provincial and\r\nbourgeois life to bear. _M. de Pourceaugnac_, 1669, is an ingenious\r\nsatire, pushed to the verge of burlesque and farce, on the country\r\nsquires of France. _Les Amants Magnifiques_, 1670, shows the writer once\r\nmore in his capacity of court playwright. But _Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme_\r\n(same date) is the most audacious and by far the most successful of the\r\nwonderful extravaganzas in which a sound and perennial motive of satire\r\non society is wrapped up, the theme this time being the bourgeoisie of\r\nParis, of which the author was himself a member. _Psyche_, 1671, is,\r\nperhaps, the most remarkable example of collaboration in literature,\r\nMoliere, Pierre Corneille, and Quinault, the greatest comic dramatist,\r\nthe greatest tragic dramatist, and the greatest opera librettist of the\r\nday, having joined their forces with a result not unworthy of them. _Les\r\nFourberies de Scapin_ (same date) is again farce, but farce such as only\r\nMoliere could write; and in _La Comtesse d'Escarbagnas_ (same date) the\r\ntheme of _M. de Pourceaugnac_ is taken up with a certain heightening of\r\ncolour and manner. _Les Femmes Savantes_, 1672, brings the reader back\r\nto what is as emphatically 'la bonne comedie' as its original _Les\r\nPrecieuses Ridicules_. The tone and treatment are more serious than in\r\nthe older piece and deal with a different variety of feminine coxcombry,\r\nbut the effect is not less happy, and is free from the broader elements\r\nof farce. Lastly, _Le Malade Imaginaire_, 1673, the swan-song of\r\nMoliere, combined both his greatest excellences, the power of raising\r\naudacious farce into the region of true comedy and the power of\r\nsatirising social abuses with a pitiless but good-humoured hand. The\r\nmain theme here is the absurdity of the current practice of medicine,\r\nbut as usual the genius of the writer veils the fact of the drama being\r\na drama with a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe unique individuality and the extraordinary merit of the various\r\npieces which make up Moliere's theatre have made it necessary to give a\r\ntolerably minute account of them, and that account will to a certain\r\nextent dispense us from dealing with his general characteristics at\r\ngreat length, especially as a few remarks on French comedy of the\r\nMolieresque kind as a whole will have to be given at the end of this\r\nchapter. Independently of the characters which Moliere shares with all\r\nthe great names of literature, his fertility and justness of thought,\r\nthe felicity of the expression in which he clothes it, and his accurate\r\nobservation of human life, there are two points in his drama which\r\nbelong, in the highest degree, to him alone. One is the extraordinary\r\nmanner in which he manages to imbue farce and burlesque with the true\r\nspirit of refined comedy. This manner has been spoken of by unfriendly\r\ncritics as 'exaggerated,' but the reproach argues a deficiency of\r\nperception. Even the most roaring farces of Moliere, even such pieces as\r\n_M. de Pourceaugnac_ and the _Bourgeois Gentilhomme_, demand rank as\r\nlegitimate comedy, owing to his unmatched faculty of intimating a\r\ngeneral purpose under the cloak of the merely ludicrous incidents which\r\nare made to surround the fortunes of a particular person. This general\r\npurpose (and here we come to the second point) is invariably a moral\r\none. Of all dramatists, ancient and modern, Moliere is perhaps that one\r\nwho has borne most constantly in mind the theory that the stage is a\r\nlay-pulpit and that its end is not merely amusement, but the reformation\r\nof manners by means of amusing spectacles. Occasionally, no doubt, he\r\nhas pushed this purpose too far and has missed his mark. He has never\r\ngiven us, and perhaps could not have given us, such examples of dramatic\r\npoetry of the non-tragic sort as Shakespeare and Calderon have given.\r\nIndeed, it seems to be a mistake to call Moliere a poet at all, despite\r\nhis extraordinary creative faculty. He was too positive, too much given\r\nto literal transcription of society, too little able to convey the vague\r\nsuggestion of beauty which, as cannot be too often repeated, is of the\r\nessence of poetry. But, if we are content to regard drama as a middle\r\nterm between poetry and prose, he, with the two poets just named, must\r\nbe appointed to the first place in it among modern authors. In\r\nbrilliancy of wit he is, among dramatists, inferior only to Aristophanes\r\nand Congreve. But he took a less Rabelaisian licence of range than\r\nAristophanes, and he never, like Congreve, allows his action to drift\r\naimlessly while his characters shoot pleasantries at one another. If we\r\nleave purely poetic merit out of the question and restrict the\r\ndefinition of comedy to the dramatic presentment of the characters and\r\nincidents of actual life, in such a manner as at once to hold the mirror\r\nup to nature and to convey lessons of morality and conduct, we must\r\nallow Moliere the rank of the greatest comic writer of all the world.\r\n_Castigat ridendo mores_ is a motto which no one challenges with such a\r\ncertainty of victory as he.\r\n\r\nAlthough the number and the diversity of Moliere's works were well\r\ncalculated to encourage imitators, it was some time before the imitators\r\nappeared. Unlike Racine, whose method was at once caught up, Moliere saw\r\nduring his lifetime no one who could even pretend to be a rival. Those\r\nwho are now classed as being in some degree of his time were for the\r\nmost part in their cradles when his masterpieces were being acted.\r\nRegnard, the best of them, was born two years after the appearance of\r\n_Le Depit Amoureux_ and only three years before the appearance of _Les\r\nPrecieuses Ridicules_. Baron was his pupil and adoring disciple.\r\nDufresny was but just of age, and Dancourt but ten years old, at his\r\ndeath. Brueys and Palaprat (the Beaumont and Fletcher, _mutatis\r\nmutandis_, of the French stage) did not make up their curious\r\nassociation till long after that event, at the date of which Le Sage was\r\nfive years old. Quinault, Boursault, and Montfleury alone were in active\r\nrivalry with him, and though none of them was destitute of merit, the\r\nmerit of none of them was in the least comparable to his. He owed this\r\nadvantage, for such it was, to his relatively early death and to the\r\nwonderfully short space of time in which his masterpieces were produced.\r\nMoliere is identified with the age of Louis XIV., yet _Les Precieuses\r\nRidicules_ was written years after the king's nominal accession, and\r\neven after his actual assumption of the reins of government from the\r\nhands of Mazarin, while _Le Malade Imaginaire_ was acted by its dying\r\nauthor more than forty years before the great king's reign ended.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contemporaries of Moliere.]\r\n\r\nThe three authors just mentioned as actually contemporary with Moliere\r\nrequire no very lengthy notice. Quinault may almost be said to have\r\nfounded a new literary school (in which none of his pupils has surpassed\r\nhim) by the excellence of his operas. Of these _Armida_ is held the\r\nbest. His comedies proper are not quite so good as his operas, but much\r\nbetter than his tragedies. One of them, _L'Amant Indiscret_, supplied\r\nNewcastle and Dryden with hints to eke out _L'Etourdi_, and most of them\r\nshow a considerable command of comic situation, if not of comic\r\nexpression. Montfleury, whose real name was Antoine Jacob, was, like\r\nMoliere, an actor. He belonged to the old or rival company of the Hotel\r\nde Bourgogne, and was born in 1640. He wrote sixteen comedies, partly on\r\ncontemporary subjects and partly adaptations of Spanish originals. The\r\ntwo best are _La Femme Juge et Partie_ and _La Fille Capitaine_. They\r\nbelong to an older style of comedy than Moliere's, being both\r\nextravagant and coarse, but there is considerable _vis comica_ in them.\r\nBoursault, who was born in 1638 and died in 1701, had still more merit,\r\nthough he too was an enemy of Moliere. His _Mercure Galant_ is his\r\nprincipal play, besides which _Esope a la Cour_, _Esope a la Ville_, and\r\n_Phaeton_ may be mentioned. He was decidedly popular both as a man and a\r\nwriter. Vanbrugh imitated more than one of his plays. In all these\r\ncomedies a certain smack of the pre-Molieresque fancy for _Comedies des\r\nChansons_ and other _tours de force_ may be perceived. Besides these\r\nthree writers others of Moliere's own contemporaries wrote comedies with\r\nmore or less success. La Fontaine himself was a dramatist, though his\r\ndramas do not approach his other work in excellence. Thomas Corneille\r\nwrote comedies, but none of importance; and Campistron attained a\r\ncertain amount of success in comic as in tragic drama. No one of these,\r\nhowever, approached the authors of the younger generation who have been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The School of Moliere-Regnard.]\r\n\r\nJean Francois Regnard, the second of French comic dramatists in general\r\nestimation (though it is doubtful whether any single piece of his equals\r\n_Turcaret_), was born at Paris in 1656, and lived a curious life. He was\r\nheir to considerable wealth and increased it, singular to say, by\r\ngambling. He had also a mania for travelling, and when he was only\r\ntwo-and-twenty was captured by an Algerian corsair and enslaved. After\r\nsome adventures of a rather dubious character he was ransomed, but\r\ncontinued to travel for some years. At last he returned to France,\r\nbought several lucrative offices and an estate in the country, and lived\r\npartly there and partly at Paris, writing comedies and indulging largely\r\nin the pleasures of the table. He died at his chateau of Grillon in\r\n1710, apparently of a fit of indigestion; but various legends are\r\ncurrent about the exact cause of his death. He wrote twenty-three plays\r\n(including one tragedy of no value) and collaborated with Dufresny in\r\nfour others. Many of these pieces were comic operas. At least a dozen\r\nwere represented by the 'Maison de Moliere.' The best of them are _Le\r\nJoueur_, _Le Distrait_, _Les Menechmes_, _Le Legataire_, the first and\r\nthe last named being his principal titles to fame. Regnard trod as\r\nclosely as he could in the steps of Moliere. He was destitute of that\r\ngreat dramatist's grasp of character and moral earnestness; but he is a\r\nthoroughly lively writer, and well merited the retort of Boileau (by no\r\nmeans a lenient critic, especially to the young men who succeeded his\r\nold friend), when some one charged Regnard with mediocrity, 'Il n'est\r\npas mediocrement gai.'\r\n\r\nBaron the actor was born in 1643 and died in 1729, after having long\r\nbeen the leading star of the French stage. He wrote, though it is\r\nsometimes said that he was aided by others, seven comedies. One of\r\nthese, _L'Andrienne_, is a clever adaptation of Terence, and another,\r\n_L'Homme aux Bonnes Fortunes_, has considerable merit in point of\r\nwriting and of that stage adaptability which few writers who have not\r\nbeen themselves actors have known how to master.\r\n\r\nCharles Riviere Dufresny, a descendant of 'La Belle Jardiniere,' one of\r\nHenri IV.'s village loves, was born in 1648 and died in 1724. He was a\r\ngreat favourite of Louis XIV. and a kind of universal genius, devoting\r\nhimself by turns to almost every branch of literature and of the arts.\r\nHe was, however, incurably desultory, and was besides a man of\r\ndisorderly life. His comedies were numerous and full of wit and\r\nknowledge of the world, but somewhat destitute of finish. Besides those\r\nin which Regnard collaborated he was the author of eleven pieces, of\r\nwhich _L'Esprit de Contradiction_, _Le Double Veuvage_, _La Coquette de\r\nVillage_, and _La Reconciliation Normande_ are perhaps the best.\r\n\r\nFlorent Carton Dancourt was born in 1661 and died in 1725. He too was a\r\nfavourite of Louis XIV., but, unlike Dufresny, he was an actor as well\r\nas an author. Towards the end of his days, having made a moderate\r\nfortune, he betook himself to a country life and to the practice of\r\nreligious duties. His _theatre_ is considerable, extending to twelve\r\nvolumes. The great peculiarity of his comedies is that they deal almost\r\nexclusively with the middle class. _Les Bourgeoises de Qualite_ and _Le\r\nChevalier a la Mode_, perhaps also _Le Galant Jardinier_ and _Les Trois\r\nCousines_, deserve mention.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Brueys and Palaprat resulted in the modern version\r\nof the famous mediaeval farce, _L'Avocat Pathelin_, and in an excellent\r\npiece of the Moliere-Regnard type, _Le Grondeur_. Some other plays of\r\nless merit were written by the friends, while each is responsible for\r\ntwo independent pieces. Both were Provencals, David Augustin de Brueys\r\nhaving been born at Aix in 1640, Jean Palaprat at Toulouse ten years\r\nlater. Brueys, who, as an abbe converted by Bossuet and engaged actively\r\nin propagating his new faith, had some difficulty in appearing publicly\r\nas a dramatic author, is understood to have had the chief share in the\r\ncomposition of the joint dramas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Characteristics of Molieresque Comedy.]\r\n\r\nThe general characteristics of this remarkable comedy are not hard to\r\ndefine. Based as it was, after Moliere had once set the example, on the\r\ndirect study of the actual facts of society and human nature, it could\r\nnot fail to appeal to universal sympathy in a very different degree from\r\nthe artificial tragedy which accompanied it. It was, moreover, far less\r\ntrammelled by rules than the sister variety of drama. Unities did not\r\npress very heavily on the comic dramatist; his choice and number of\r\ncharacters, his licence of action on the stage, and so forth, were\r\nunlimited; he could write in prose or verse at his pleasure, and, if he\r\nchose verse, he was bound to a much less monotonous kind of it than his\r\ntragic brother. Consequently the majority of the objections which lie\r\nagainst the masterpieces of Corneille and Racine, and which make the\r\nwork of their imitators almost unreadable, leave Moliere and his\r\nfollowers unscathed. One drawback only remained, the drawback already\r\ncommented on in the case of tragedy, and admitted by French critics\r\nthemselves in some such terms as that Shakespeare took individuals,\r\nMoliere took types. The advantage of the latter method for enforcing a\r\nmoral lesson is evident; its literary disadvantages are evident\r\nlikewise. It leads to an ignoring of the complexity of human nature and\r\nto an unnatural prominence of the 'ruling passion.' The highest dramatic\r\ntriumphs of single character in comedy, Falstaff, Rosalind, Beatrice,\r\nbecome impossible. As it has been remarked, the very titles of these\r\nplays, _Le Misanthrope_, _Le Joueur_, _Le Grondeur_, show their defects.\r\nNo man is a mere misanthrope, a mere gambler, a mere grumbler; and the\r\ndramatist who approaches comedy from the side of Moliere is but too apt\r\nto forget the fact in his anxiety to enforce his moral and deepen the\r\nstrokes of his general type.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[233] Ed.

Up to\r\nthe beginning of the seventeenth century, France had known nothing of it\r\nexcept the short prose tales which had succeeded the Fabliaux, and which\r\nhad been chiefly founded on imitation of the Italians, with the late and\r\ninferior prose versions of the romances of chivalry, the isolated\r\nmasterpiece of _Gargantua_ and _Pantagruel_, and the translated and\r\nadapted versions of the _Amadis_ and its continuations. The imitation of\r\nSpanish literature was constant in the early seventeenth century, and\r\nthe great wave of conceited style which, under the various names of\r\nEuphuism, Gongorism, Marinism, invaded all the literary countries of\r\nEurope, did not spare France. The result was a very singular class of\r\nliterature which, except for a few burlesque works, almost monopolised\r\nthe attention of novelists during the first half of the century. The\r\nexample of it was in a manner set by Honore d'Urfe in the _Astree_,\r\nwhich was, however, rather pastoral than heroic. D'Urfe, who was a man\r\nof position and wealth in the district of Forez, imagined, on the banks\r\nof the Lignon, a stream running past his home, a kind of Arcadia, the\r\npopularity of which is sufficiently shown by the adoption of the name of\r\nthe hero, Celadon, as one of the stock names in French for a lover. He\r\ntook, perhaps, some of his machinery from the _Aminta_ of Tasso and from\r\nthe other Italian pastorals, but he emulated the _Amadis_ in the\r\ninterminable series of adventures and the long-windedness of his\r\ntreatment. He had, however, some literary power, while the necessary\r\nverisimilitude was provided for by the adaptation of numerous personal\r\nexperiences, and the book has preserved a certain reputation for\r\ngraceful sentiment and attractive pictures of nature. It was\r\nextraordinarily popular at the time and long afterwards, so much so that\r\na contemporary ecclesiastic, Camus de Pontcarre, considered it necessary\r\nto supply an antidote to the bane in the shape of a series of Christian\r\npastorals, the name of one of which, _Palombe_, is known, because of an\r\nedition of it in the present century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Heroic Romances.]\r\n\r\nD'Urfe belonged as much to the sixteenth as to the seventeenth century,\r\nthough the _Astree_ was the work of the latter part of his life, and was\r\nindeed left unfinished by him. It was shortly afterwards, under the\r\ninfluence chiefly of the growing fancy for literary _coteries_, that the\r\nheroic romance properly so called was born. This was usually a narration\r\nof vast length, in which sometimes the heroes and heroines of classical\r\nantiquity, sometimes personages due more or less to the author's\r\nimagination, were conducted through a more than Amadis-like series of\r\ntrials and adventures, with interludes and a general setting of\r\nhigh-flown gallantry. This latter possessed a complete jargon of its\r\nown, and (though the hypothesis of its power over the classical French\r\ndrama is for the most part exaggerated) continued to exercise a vast\r\ninfluence on literature and on society, even after Moliere had poured on\r\nits chief practitioners and advocates the undying mockery of his\r\n_Precieuses Ridicules_. There were three prominent authors in this\r\nstyle, Mademoiselle de Scudery, La Calprenede, and Gomberville.\r\nMademoiselle de Scudery, known in the _coterie_ nomenclature of the time\r\nas 'Sapho,' was the sister of Georges de Scudery, and a woman of\r\nconsiderable talent and more considerable industry. Madeleine de Scudery\r\nwas born at Havre in 1607, and died at Paris in 1701, her life thus\r\ncovering nearly the whole of the century of which she was one of the\r\nmost conspicuous literary figures. She had no beauty--indeed she was\r\nvery ugly--but the eccentric military and literary reputation of her\r\nbrother and her own talents made her the centre and head of an important\r\n_coterie_ in the capital. Her romances, the earliest of which was\r\n_Ibrahim_, were published under her brother's name, but their\r\nauthorship was well known. She was extremely accomplished, not merely in\r\nthe accomplishments of a blue-stocking but in art, and even in\r\nhousewifery. After her series of romances was finished she published\r\nmany volumes, chiefly condensed or extracted from them, containing\r\n_Conversations_ of the moral kind, which attracted attention from some\r\npersons who had not condescended to the romances themselves. It ought\r\nnever to be forgotten that among the most fervent admirers of her books\r\nand of their fellows was Madame de Sevigne, who was certainly almost as\r\nacute in literary criticism as she was skilful in literary composition.\r\nHer novels, the most famous of their class, are the _Grand Cyrus_,\r\notherwise _Artamene_, _Clelie_, _Ibrahim_, or the _Illustrious Bassa_,\r\nand _Almahide_, the latter being partly, but chiefly in the name of the\r\nheroine, the source of Dryden's _Conquest of Granada_. The _Grand Cyrus_\r\nis, at least by title, the best remembered, but it is in _Clelie_ that\r\nthe best-known and most characteristic trait appears, the delineation\r\nand description namely of the _Carte de Tendre_[242]. Tendre is the\r\ncountry of love, through which flows the river of Inclination watering\r\nthe villages of 'Pretty Verses,' 'Gallant Epistles,' 'Assiduity,' etc.,\r\nwhile elsewhere in the region are the less cheerful localities of\r\n'Levity,' 'Indifference,' 'Perfidy,' and so forth. La Calprenede, a\r\nGascon by birth, was the author of _Cleopatre_ (which ranks perhaps with\r\n_Cyrus_ as the chief example of the style), of _Cassandre_ and of\r\n_Pharamond_. Gauthier de Coste (which was his personal name) figures,\r\nlike most of the notable persons of the middle of the century, in the\r\n_Historiettes_ of Tallemant, who says of him, 'Il n'y a jamais eu un\r\nhomme plus Gascon que celui-ci.' The assertion is supported by some\r\ncharacteristic but not easily quotable anecdotes. The criticism of\r\nTallemant, however, does not apply badly to the whole class of\r\ncompositions. 'Les heros,' says he, speaking of _Cassandre_, 'se\r\nressemblent comme deux gouttes d'eau, parlent tous _Phebus_ (the\r\neuphuist jargon of the time), et sont tous des gens a cent mille lieues\r\nau dessus des autres hommes.' Marin le Roy, Seigneur de Gomberville, who\r\nwas something of a Jansenist, attended rather to edification than\r\ngallantry in his _Alcidiane_, _Caritee_, _Polexandre_, and _Cytheree_.\r\nThough earlier in date he is inferior in power to Mademoiselle de\r\nScudery and to La Calprenede, the first of whom had some wit and much\r\nculture, while La Calprenede possessed a decided grasp of heroic\r\ncharacter and some notion of the method of composing historical novels.\r\nGomberville, a man of wealth and position, was also a writer of moral\r\nworks. Putting the artificiality of the general style out of the\r\nquestion, the chief fault to be found with these books is their enormous\r\nlength. They fill eight, ten, or even twelve volumes; they consist of\r\nfive, six, or even seven thousand pages, though the pages are not very\r\nlarge and the print by no means close. Even the liveliest work--work\r\nlike Fielding's or Le Sage's--would become tiresome on such a scale as\r\nthis; and it is still incomprehensible how any one not having some\r\nspecial object to serve by it could struggle through such enormous\r\nwastes of verbiage and unreality as form the bulk of these novels. Even\r\nwhen the passion for the heroic style strictly so called began to wane\r\nno great improvement at first manifested itself. Catherine\r\nDesjardins[243] (who wrote under the name of Madame de Villedieu)\r\nproduced numerous books (the chief of which is _Le Grand Alcandre_), not\r\nindeed so absolutely preposterous in general conception, but even more\r\nvapid and destitute of originality and distinction[244].\r\n\r\nThese impracticable and barren styles of fiction were succeeded in the\r\nlatter half of the century by something much better. The Picaroon\r\nromance of Spain inspired Paul Scarron with the first of a long line of\r\nnovels which, in the hands of Le Sage, Defoe, Fielding, and Smollett,\r\nenriched the literature of Europe with remarkable work. Madame de la\r\nFayette laid the foundation of the novel proper, or story of analysis of\r\ncharacter; and towards the close of the century the fairy tale attained,\r\nin the hands of Anthony Hamilton, Perrault and Madame d'Aulnoy, its\r\nmost delightful and abundant development.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scarron.]\r\n\r\nPaul Scarron was one of the most remarkable literary figures of the\r\ncentury in respect of originality and eccentric talent, though few\r\nsingle works of his possess formal completeness. He was of a family of\r\nPiedmontese origin and very well connected, his father, of the same\r\nname, being a member of the Parliament of Paris, and of sufficiently\r\nindependent humour to oppose Richelieu. Paul Scarron the younger (he had\r\nhad an elder brother of the same name who had died an infant) was born\r\nin 1610, and his mother did not outlive his third year. His father\r\nmarried again; the stepmother did not get on well with Paul, and he was\r\nhalf obliged and half induced to become an abbe. For some years he lived\r\na merry life, partly at Rome, partly at Paris. But when he was still\r\nyoung a great calamity fell on him. A cock-and-bull story of his having\r\ndisguised himself as a savage in a kind of voluntary tar-and-feather\r\nsuit, and having been struck with paralysis in consequence of plunging\r\ninto an ice-cold stream to escape the populace, is usually told, but\r\nthere seems to be no truth in it. An attack of fever, followed by\r\nrheumatism and mismanaged by the physicians of the day, appears to have\r\nbeen the real cause of his misfortune. At any rate, for the last twenty\r\nyears of his life he was hopelessly deformed, almost helpless, and\r\nsubject to acute attacks of pain. But his spirit was unconquerable. He\r\nhad some preferment at Le Mans and a pension from the queen, which he\r\nlost on suspicion of writing _Mazarinades_. Besides these he had what he\r\ncalled his 'Marquisat de Quinet,' that is to say, the money which Quinet\r\nthe bookseller paid him for his wares. In 1652 he astonished Paris by\r\nmarrying Francoise d'Aubigne, the future Madame de Maintenon, the\r\ngranddaughter of Agrippa d'Aubigne. The strange couple seem to have been\r\nhappy enough, and such unfavourable reports as exist against Madame\r\nScarron may be set down to political malice. But Scarron's health was\r\nutterly broken, and he died in 1660 at the age of fifty. His work was\r\nnot inconsiderable, including some plays and much burlesque poetry, the\r\nchief piece of which was his 'Virgil travestied,' an ignoble task at\r\nbest, but very cleverly performed. His prose, however, is of much\r\ngreater value. Many of his _nouvelles_, mostly imitated from the\r\nSpanish, have merit, and his _Roman Comique_[245], though also inspired\r\nto some extent from the peninsula, has still more. It is the unfinished\r\nhistory of a troop of strolling actors, displaying extraordinary truth\r\nof observation and power of realistic description in the style which, as\r\nhas been said, Le Sage and Fielding afterwards made popular throughout\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cyrano de Bergerac.]\r\n\r\nWith Scarron may be classed another writer of not dissimilar character,\r\nbut of far less talent, whose eccentricities have given him a\r\ndisproportionate reputation even in France, while they have often\r\nentirely misled foreign critics. Cyrano de Bergerac was a Gascon of not\r\ninconsiderable literary power, whose odd personal appearance, audacity\r\nas a duellist, and adherence, after conversion, to the unpopular cause\r\nof Mazarin, gave him a position which his works fail to sustain. They\r\nare not, however, devoid of merit. His _Pedant Joue_, a comedy, gave\r\nMoliere some useful hints; his _Agrippine_, a tragedy, has passages of\r\ndeclamatory energy. But his best work comes under the head of fiction.\r\nThe _Voyages a la Lune et au Soleil_[246], in which the author partly\r\nfollowed Rabelais, and partly indulged his own fancy for rodomontade,\r\npersonal satire, and fantastic extravagance, have had attributed to them\r\nthe great and wholly unmerited honour of setting a pattern to Swift.\r\nCyrano, let it be repeated, was a man of talent, but his powers (he died\r\nbefore he was thirty-five) had not time to mature, and the reckless\r\nboastfulness of his character would probably have disqualified him at\r\nall times from adequate study and self-criticism. Personally, he is an\r\namusing and interesting figure in literary history, but he is not much\r\nmore. In company with him and with Scarron may be mentioned Dassoucy,\r\nalternately a friend and enemy of Cyrano, and a light writer of some\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Furetiere.]\r\n\r\nCharles Sorel, an exceedingly voluminous author, historiographer of\r\nFrance, deserves mention in passing for his _Histoire Comique de\r\nFrancion_[247], in which, as in almost all the fictitious work of the\r\ntime, serious as well as comic, living persons are introduced. The\r\nchief remarkable thing about _Francion_ is the evidence it gives of an\r\nattempt at an early date (1623) to write a novel of ordinary manners. It\r\nis a dull story with loose episodes. More interesting is Antoine\r\nFuretiere, author of the _Roman Bourgeois_[248]. Furetiere, who was a\r\nman of varied talent, holds no small place in the history of the\r\ncalamities of authors. He wrote poems, short tales, fables, satires,\r\ncriticisms. He is said to have given both Boileau and Racine not\r\ninconsiderable assistance. Unfortunately for him, though he had been\r\nelected an academician in 1662, he conceived and executed the idea of\r\noutstripping his tardy colleagues in their dictionary work. He produced\r\na book of great merit and utility, but one which brought grave troubles\r\non his own head. It was alleged that he had infringed the privileges of\r\nthe Academy; he was expelled from that body, his own privilege for his\r\nown book was revoked, and it was not published till after his death,\r\nbecoming eventually the well-known _Dictionnaire de Trevoux_.\r\nFuretiere's side has been warmly taken in these days, and it has been\r\nsought, not without success, to free him from the charge of all\r\nimpropriety of conduct, except the impropriety of continuing to be a\r\nmember of the Academy, while what he was doing could hardly be regarded\r\nas anything but a slight on it. The _Roman Bourgeois_ is an original and\r\nlively book, without any general plot, but containing a series of very\r\namusing pictures of the Parisian middle-class society of the day, with\r\nmany curious traits of language and manners. It was published in 1666.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de la Fayette.]\r\n\r\nOf very different importance is the Countess de la Fayette, who has the\r\ncredit, and justly, of substituting for mere romances of adventure on\r\nthe one hand, and for stilted heroic work on the other, fiction in which\r\nthe display of character is held of chief account. In the school,\r\nindeed, of which Scarron set the example in France, especially in _Gil\r\nBlas_, its masterpiece, the most accurate knowledge and drawing of human\r\nmotives and actions is to be found. But it is knowledge and drawing of\r\nhuman motives and actions in the gross rather than in particular. Gil\r\nBlas, and even Tom Jones, are types rather than individuals, though the\r\ngenius of their creators hides the fact. It is, perhaps, an arguable\r\npoint of literary criticism, whether the persevering analysis of\r\nindividual, and more or less unusual, character does not lead novelists\r\naway from the best path--as it certainly leads in the long run to\r\nmonstrosities of the modern French and English 'realist' type. But this\r\nis a detail of criticism into which there is no need to enter here. It\r\nis sufficient that the style has produced some of the most admirable,\r\nand much of the most characteristic, work of the last century, and that\r\nMadame de la Fayette is on the whole entitled to the credit of being its\r\noriginator. Her pen was taken up in the next century by the Abbe Prevost\r\nand by Richardson, and from these three the novel, as opposed to the\r\nromance, may be said to descend. The maiden name of Madame de la\r\nFayette[249] was Marie Madeleine Pioche de la Vergne, and she was born\r\nat Paris in 1634. Her father was governor of Havre. She was carefully\r\nbrought up under Menage and Rapin, among others, and was one of the most\r\nbrilliant of the _precieuses_ of the Hotel Rambouillet. In 1655 she\r\nmarried the Count de la Fayette, but was soon left a widow. After his\r\ndeath she contracted a kind of Platonic friendship with La\r\nRochefoucauld, who was then in the decline of life, tormented with gout,\r\nand consoling himself for the departure of the days when he was one of\r\nthe most important men in France by the composition of his undying\r\nMaxims. She survived him thirteen years, and died herself in 1693.\r\nDuring the whole of her life she was on the most intimate terms with\r\nMadame de Sevigne, as well as with many of the foremost men of letters\r\nof the time. In particular there are extant a large number of letters\r\nbetween her and Huet, bishop of Avranches, one of the most learned,\r\namiable, and upright prelates of the age. Her first attempt at\r\nnovel-writing was _La Princesse de Montpensier_. This was followed by\r\n_Zaide_, published in 1670, a book of considerable excellence; and this\r\nin its turn by _La Princesse de Cleves_, published in 1677, which is one\r\nof the classics of French literature. The book is but a small one, not\r\namounting in size to a single volume of a modern English novel, and this\r\nmust of itself have been no small novelty and relief after the\r\nportentous bulk of the Scudery romances. Its scene is laid at the court\r\nof Henri II., and there is a certain historical basis; but the principal\r\npersonages are drawn from the author's own experience, herself being the\r\nheroine, her husband the Prince of Cleves, and Rochefoucauld the Duke de\r\nNemours, while other characters are identified with Louis XIV. and his\r\ncourtiers by industrious compilers of 'keys.' If, however, the interest\r\nof the book had been limited to this it would now-a-days have lost all\r\nits attraction, or have retained so much at most as is due to simple\r\ncuriosity. But it has far higher merits, and what may be called its\r\ncourt apparatus, and the multitude of small details about court\r\nbusiness, are rather drawbacks to it now. Such charm as it has is\r\nderived from the strict verisimilitude of the character drawing, and the\r\nfidelity with which the emotions are represented. This interest may,\r\nindeed, appear thin to a modern reader fresh from the works of those who\r\nhave profited by two centuries of progress in the way which Madame de la\r\nFayette opened. But when it is remembered that her book appeared thirty\r\nyears before _Gil Blas_, forty before the masterpieces of Defoe, and\r\nmore than half a century before the English novel properly so called\r\nmade its first appearance, her right to the place she occupied will\r\nhardly be contested[250].\r\n\r\nThe precise origin of the fancy for writing fairy stories, which took\r\npossession of polite society in France at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, has been the subject of much discussion, and cannot be said to\r\nhave been finally settled. Probably the fables of La Fontaine, which are\r\nvery closely allied to the style, may have given the required impulse.\r\nAs soon as an example was set this style was seen to lend itself very\r\nwell to the still surviving fancy for _coterie_ compositions, and the\r\ntotal amount of work of the kind produced in the last years of the\r\nseventeenth and the first of the eighteenth century must be enormous.\r\nMuch of it has not yet been printed, and the names of but few of the\r\nauthors are generally known, or perhaps worth knowing[251]. Three,\r\nhowever, emerge from the mass and deserve attention--Anthony Hamilton,\r\nMadame d'Aulnoy, and above all, Charles Perrault, the master beyond all\r\ncomparison of the style.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fairy Tales.]\r\n\r\nMarie Catherine, Comtesse d'Aulnoy, was born about the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, and died in 1720. It is sufficient to say that\r\namong her works are the 'Yellow Dwarf' and the 'White Cat,' stories\r\nwhich no doubt she did not invent, but to which she has given their\r\npermanent and well-known form. She wrote much else, memoirs and novels\r\nwhich were bad imitations of the style of Madame de la Fayette, but her\r\nfairy tales alone are of value. Anthony Hamilton was one of the rare\r\nauthors who acquire a durable reputation by writing in a language which\r\nis not their native tongue. He was born in Ireland in 1646, and followed\r\nthe fortunes of the exiled royal family. He returned with Charles II.,\r\nbut adhering to Catholicism, was excluded from preferment in England\r\nuntil James II.'s reign, and he passed most of his time before the\r\nRevolution, and all of it afterwards, in France. Hamilton produced\r\n(besides many fugitive poems and minor pieces) two books of great note\r\nin French, the _Memoires de Grammont_, his brother-in-law, which perhaps\r\nis the standard book for the manners of the court of Charles II., and a\r\ncollection of fairy tales, less simple than those of Perrault and Madame\r\nd'Aulnoy and more subordinated to a sarcastic intention, but full of wit\r\nand written in French, which is only more piquant for its very slight\r\ntouch of a foreign element. Many phrases of Hamilton's tales have passed\r\ninto ordinary quotation, notably 'Belier, mon ami, tu me ferais plaisir\r\nsi tu voulais commencer par le commencement.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perrault.]\r\n\r\nThe master of the style was, however, as has been said, Charles\r\nPerrault, whose literary history was peculiar. He was born at Paris in\r\n1628, being the son of Pierre Perrault, a lawyer, who had three other\r\nsons, all of them of some distinction, and one of them, Claude Perrault,\r\nfamous in the oddly conjoined professions of medicine and architecture.\r\nCharles was well educated at the College de Beauvais, and at first\r\nstudied law, but his father soon afterwards bought a place of value in\r\nthe financial department, and Charles was appointed clerk in 1662. He\r\nreceived a curious and rather nondescript preferment (as secretary to\r\nColbert for all matters dependent on literature and arts), which, among\r\nother things, enabled him to further his brother's architectural career.\r\nIn 1671 he was, under the patronage of Colbert, elected of the Academy,\r\ninto the affairs and proceedings of which he imported order almost for\r\nthe first time. He had done and for some time did little in literature,\r\nbeing occupied by the duties which, under Colbert, he had as controller\r\nof public works. But after a few essays in poetry, partly burlesque and\r\npartly serious, notably a _Siecle de Louis XIV._, he embarked on the\r\nrather unlucky work which gave him his chief reputation among his own\r\ncontemporaries, the _Parallele des Anciens et des Modernes_, in which he\r\ntook the part of the moderns. The dispute which followed, due\r\nprincipally to the overbearing rudeness of Boileau, has had something\r\nmore than its proper place in literary history, and there is no need to\r\ngive an account of it. It is enough to say that while Boileau as far as\r\nhis knowledge went (and that was not far, for he knew nothing of\r\nEnglish, not very much of Greek, and it would seem little of Italian or\r\nSpanish) had the better case, Perrault, assisted by his brother, made a\r\ngood deal the best use of his weapons, Boileau's unlucky 'Ode on Namur'\r\ngiving his enemies a great hold on him. After six years' fighting,\r\nhowever, the enemies made peace, and, indeed, it does not seem that\r\nPerrault at any time bore malice. He produced, besides some memoirs and\r\nthe charming trifles to be presently spoken of[252], a good many\r\nmiscellanies in prose and verse of no particular value, and died in\r\n1703.\r\n\r\nHis first tale, _Griselidis_ (in verse, and by no means his best),\r\nappeared in 1691, _Peau d'Ane_ and _Les Souhaits Ridicules_ in 1694, _La\r\nBelle au Bois Dormant_ in 1696, and the rest in 1697. These are _Le\r\nPetit Chaperon Rouge_, _La Barbe Bleue_, _Le Maitre Chat ou le Chat\r\nBotte_, _Les Fees_, _Cendrillon_, _Riquet a la Houppe_, and _Le Petit\r\nPoucet_. It is needless to say that Perrault did not invent the subjects\r\nof them. What he contributed was an admirable and peculiar narrative\r\nstyle, due, as seems very probable, in great part to the example of La\r\nFontaine, but distinguished therefrom by all the difference of verse and\r\nprose. The characteristics of this style are an extreme simplicity\r\nwhich does not degenerate into puerility, great directness, and at the\r\nsame time vividness in telling the story, and a remarkable undercurrent\r\nof wit which is never obtrusive, as is sometimes the case in the verse\r\ntales. Perrault's stories deserve their immense popularity, and they\r\nfound innumerable imitators chiefly among persons of quality, who, as M.\r\nHonore Bonhomme, the best authority on the obscurer fairy-tale writers,\r\nobserves, probably found an attraction in the style because of the way\r\nin which it lent itself to cover personal satire. This, however, is\r\nsomething of an abuse, and little or nothing of it is discernible in\r\nPerrault's own work, though later, and especially in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, it was frequently if not invariably present.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO THE LAST THREE CHAPTERS.\r\n\r\nAlthough the list of names mentioned here under the respective heads of\r\npoets, dramatists, and novelists is considerable, it is very far indeed\r\nfrom being exhaustive. It may, indeed, be said generally that it is only\r\npossible in this history, especially as we leave the invention of\r\nprinting farther and farther behind, to mention those names which have\r\nleft something like a memory behind them. The dramas and novels of the\r\nseventeenth century are extremely numerous, and have been but very\r\npartially explored. In regard to the poems there is an additional\r\ndifficulty. It was a fashion of the time to collect such things in\r\n_recueils_--miscellaneous collections--in which the work of very large\r\nnumbers of writers, who never published their poems separately or\r\nobtained after their own day any recognition as poets, is buried.\r\nSpecimens, published here and there by the laborious editors of the\r\ngreater classics in illustration of these latter, show that with\r\nleisure, opportunity, and critical discernment, this little-worked vein\r\nmight be followed up not without advantage. But for such a purpose, as\r\nfor the similar exploration of many other out-of-the-way corners of this\r\nvast literature, conditions are needed which are eminently 'the gift of\r\nfortune.' These remarks apply more or less to all the following chapters\r\nand books of this history. But they may find an appropriate place here,\r\nnot merely because it is from this period onwards that they are most\r\napplicable, but because this special department of French literary\r\nhistory--the earlier seventeenth century--contains, perhaps, the\r\ngreatest proportion of this wreckage of time as yet unrummaged and\r\nunsorted by posterity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[242] Not _du_ Tendre, as it is often erroneously cited in French and\r\nEnglish works.\r\n\r\n[243] The learned editor of Tallemant des Reaux calls her Marie\r\nHortense. She also wrote verses and plays. There were many other romance\r\nwriters of the period now forgotten, or remembered only for other\r\nthings, such as the Abbe d'Aubignac.\r\n\r\n[244] I cannot boast of an intimate or exhaustive acquaintance with the\r\n'heroic' romances; but I have taken care to satisfy myself of the\r\naccuracy of the statements in the text.\r\n\r\n[245] Ed.

The names of Madame de Sevigne, of the Cardinal de\r\nRetz, of La Rochefoucauld, and at the extreme end of the period of Saint\r\nSimon, rank among those of the most original writers of France, while\r\nthe historical essay has rarely assumed a more thoroughly literary form\r\nthan in the short sketches of Retz, Sarrasin, and others. The subject of\r\nthe present chapter may, therefore, be divided into four parts, the\r\nhistorians properly so called (the least interesting of the four), the\r\nhistorical essayists, the memoir-writers, and the letter-writers, with\r\nan appendix of erudite cultivators of historical science and of\r\nmiscellaneous authors of historical gossip and other matters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Historians. Mezeray.]\r\n\r\n[253]It is said not unfrequently that the only historical work of this\r\nparticular period, combining magnitude of subject with elevation and\r\noriginality of thought and literary excellence of expression, is\r\nBossuet's discourse on universal history. There is not a little truth in\r\nthe saying. Still there are a few authors whose work deserves mention.\r\nThe great history of De Thou was written in Latin. But the century\r\nproduced in Mezeray's History of France the first attempt of merit on\r\nthe subject. Francois Eudes de Mezeray was the son of a surgeon, who\r\nseems to have been of some means and position. Mezeray was educated at\r\nCaen (he was born in 1610), and he early betook himself to historical\r\nstudies. After beginning by supervising a translated history of the\r\nTurks, he set to work on his masterpiece, the _History of France_, which\r\nappeared in three huge and splendid folios in 1643, 1646, and 1651. He\r\nwas accused of treating his predecessors with too great contempt; but\r\nthis was more than justified by the superiority, not merely in style but\r\nin historical conception and attention to documentary evidence, which he\r\nshowed. Mezeray had been protected and pensioned by Richelieu, but under\r\nMazarin he became a violent pamphleteer and author of _Mazarinades_.\r\nLater, when Louis XIV. was settled on the throne, he published an\r\nabridgment of his own history, in which the keen scent of Colbert\r\ndiscovered uncourtly strictures on the fiscal abuses of the kingdom.\r\nMezeray refused to alter them, and was mulcted accordingly of part of\r\nhis pension. He died in 1683, having earned the title of the first\r\nhistorian, worthy of the name, of France. With due allowance for his\r\nperiod, he may challenge comparison with almost any of his successors,\r\nthough his style, excellent at its best, is somewhat unequal. Perefixe\r\n(who may have been assisted by Mezeray) is responsible for a history of\r\nHenri IV.; Maimbourg for a history of the League which has some interest\r\nfor Englishmen because Dryden translated it. The same great English\r\nwriter projected but did not accomplish a translation from a much more\r\nworthless historian, Varillas, who is notorious among his class for\r\nindifference to accuracy. It is indeed curious that this century, side\r\nby side with the most laborious investigators ever known, produced a\r\nschool of historians who, with some merits of style, were almost\r\ndeliberately unfaithful to fact. If the well-known saying ('Mon siege\r\nest fait') attributed to the Abbe Vertot is not apocryphal[254], he must\r\nbe ranked in the less respectable class. But his well-known histories,\r\nthe chief of which is devoted to the Knights of Malta, were not wholly\r\nconstructed on this principle. Pellisson wrote a history of the Academy,\r\nof which he was secretary, and one of the living Louis XIV., which, as\r\nmight be expected, is little more than an ingenious panegyric. The Pere\r\nDaniel wrote a history of France, the Pere d'Orleans one of the English\r\nrevolutions; while Rapin de Thoyras, a Huguenot and a refugee, had the\r\nglory of composing in a foreign language the first book deserving the\r\ntitle of a History of England. Superior to all these writers, except to\r\nMezeray, are the ecclesiastical historians Fleury and Tillemont. Fleury\r\nwas a good writer, very learned and exceedingly fair. Tillemont, with\r\nless pretentions to style, is second to no writer of history in\r\nlearning, industry, accuracy, and judgment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical Essayists.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Saint Real.]\r\n\r\nThe historical essay, like much else of value at the time, was in great\r\npart due to the mania for _coteries_. In these select societies\r\nliterature was the favourite occupation, and ingenuity was ransacked to\r\ndiscover forms of composition admitting of treatment in brief space and\r\nof the display of literary skill. The personal 'portrait,' or elaborate\r\nprose character, was of this kind, but the ambition of the competitors\r\nsoared higher than mere character-drawing. They sought for some striking\r\nevent, if possible contemporary, which offered, within moderate compass,\r\ndramatic unity and scope for something like dramatic treatment.\r\nSometimes, as in the _Relation du Passage du Rhin_, by the Count de\r\nGuiche, personal experiences formed the basis, but more frequently\r\npassages in the recent history of other nations were chosen. Of this\r\nkind was the _Conspiration de Walstein_ of Sarrasin, which, though\r\nincomplete, is admirable in style. Better still is the _Conjuration de\r\nFiesque_ of the Cardinal de Retz, his first work, and one written when\r\nhe was but seventeen. Not a few of the scattered writings of Saint\r\nEvremond may be classed under this head, notably the Letter to Crequi on\r\nthe Peace of the Pyrenees, which was the cause of his exile, though this\r\nwas rather political than historical. Towards the end of the century,\r\nthe Abbe Vertot preluded his larger histories by a short tract on the\r\nrevolutions of Portugal, and another on those of Sweden, which had both\r\nmerit and success. It will be observed that conspiracies, revolutions,\r\nand such-like events formed the staple subjects of these compositions.\r\nOf this class was the masterpiece of the style--the only one perhaps\r\nwhich as a type at least merits something more than a mere mention--the\r\n_Conjuration des Espagnols contre Venise_[255] of Saint Real, a piece\r\nfamous in French literature as a capital example of historical narration\r\non the small scale, and not unimportant to English literature as the\r\nbasis of Otway's principal tragedy. Cesar Vichard, Abbe de Saint Real,\r\nwas born at Chambery in 1631, and died at the same place in 1692. He was\r\nsent early to Paris, betook himself to historical studies, and published\r\nvarious works, including certain discourses on history, a piece on Don\r\nCarlos, and the _Conjuration des Espagnols_ itself, which appeared in\r\n1672. Shortly afterwards he visited London, and was for a time a member\r\nof the _coterie_ of Saint Evremond and Hortense Mancini. He returned to\r\nParis and thence, in 1679, to his native town, where the Duke of Savoy\r\nmade him his historiographer and a member of the Academy of Turin. Not\r\nlong before his death he was employed in political work. Saint Real's\r\nchief characteristics as a historian are the preference before\r\neverything else of a dramatic conception and treatment, and the\r\nemployment of a singularly vivid and idiomatic style, simple in its\r\nvocabulary and phrase and yet in the highest degree picturesque. He has\r\nbeen accused of following his master, Varillas, in want of strict\r\naccuracy, but in truth strict accuracy was not aimed at by any of these\r\nessayists. Their object was to produce a creditable literary\r\ncomposition, to set forth their subject strikingly and dramatically, and\r\nto point a moral of some kind. In all three respects their success was\r\nnot contemptible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Memoir-writers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rohan]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bassompierre.]\r\n\r\nThe memoir-writers proper, who confine themselves to what they in their\r\nown persons have done, heard, or thought, are, as has been said, of far\r\nmore importance. Their number is very great, and investigations into the\r\nvast record treasures which, after revolutionary devastation, France\r\nstill possesses, is yearly increasing the knowledge of them. Only a\r\nbrief account can here be attempted of most of them; and where the\r\nhistorical importance of the writer exceeds or equals his importance as\r\na literary figure, biographical details will be but sparingly given, as\r\nthey are easily and more suitably to be found elsewhere. The earliest\r\nwriter who properly comes within our century (the order of the\r\ncollection of Michaud and Poujoulat is followed for convenience sake) is\r\nFrancois Duval, Marquis de Fontenay Mareuil. Fontenay was a soldier, a\r\ncourtier, and a diplomatist, in which last character he visited England.\r\nHe has left us connected memoirs from 1609 to 1624, and some short\r\naccounts of later transactions, such as the siege of La Rochelle, and\r\nhis own mission to Rome. Fontenay is a simple and straightforward\r\nwriter, full of good sense, and not destitute of narrative power. To\r\nPaul Phelypeaux de Pontchartrain (1566-1621) we owe a somewhat jejune\r\nbut careful and apparently faithful account of the minority of Louis\r\nXIII. A short and striking relation of the downfall of Concini is\r\nsupposed to be the work of Michel de Marillac, keeper of the seals\r\n(1573-1632), afterwards one of the victims of Richelieu. Henri de Rohan\r\n(1579-1638) is very far superior to the writers just named. Of the\r\ngreatest house, save one or two, in France, he travelled much,\r\ndistinguished himself in battle, both in foreign and civil war; was once\r\ncondemned to death, made head for a time against all the strength of\r\nRichelieu; was near purchasing the principality of Cyprus from the\r\nVenetians, and establishing himself in the east; was recalled, commanded\r\nthe French forces with brilliant success in the Valtelline, and met his\r\ndeath under Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar at Rheinfeld. Besides his memoirs he\r\nwrote a book called the _Parfait Capitaine_, and some others. The\r\nmemoirs extend from the death of Henri IV. to the year 1629, and have\r\nall the vigour and brilliancy of the best sixteenth-century work of the\r\nkind. A further account of the Valtelline campaign is also most probably\r\nRohan's, though it is not written in the first person, and has been\r\nattributed to others. Of still greater personal interest are the memoirs\r\nof Francois, Marechal de Bassompierre, another of the adversaries of\r\nRichelieu, and who, less fortunate than Rohan, languished twelve years\r\nin the Bastille. Few persons played a more active part in the first\r\nyears of the reign of Louis XIII. than Bassompierre, and no one has left\r\na livelier description, not merely of his own personal fortunes, but of\r\nthe personality of his contemporaries, the habits and customs of the\r\ntime, the wars, the loves, the intrigues of himself, his friends and his\r\nenemies. He has not the credit of being very accurate, but he is\r\ninfinitely amusing. His memoirs were written during his sojourn in the\r\nBastille. This was terminated by the death of Richelieu, but\r\nBassompierre followed his enemy before very long in consequence of an\r\nattack of apoplexy.\r\n\r\nIn singular contrast to Bassompierre's work are the memoirs of another\r\nchronicler of the same time, Francois Annibal, Marechal d'Estrees,\r\nbrother of the mistress of Henri IV. D'Estrees excludes all gossip,\r\nconfines himself strictly to matters of public business, and recounts\r\nthem apparently with scrupulous accuracy, and in a plain but clear and\r\nsufficient style. Among the most curious and not the least interesting\r\nof the works of this class are the memoirs of Pontis--one of the famous\r\nsolitaries of Port Royal in his old age. Pontis died at the age of\r\neighty-seven, and had been for fifty-six years in the army. His memoirs,\r\nwhich are strictly confined to his personal experiences, obtained the\r\napprobation of two such undeniably competent judges as Conde and Madame\r\nde Sevigne, and are by no means unworthy of the honour. The actual\r\ncomposition of the memoirs is said to be the work of Thomas du Fosse.\r\nThe memoirs called Richelieu's are different from all these, and,\r\nnotwithstanding their great extent and the illustrious name they bear,\r\nof very inferior interest, at least from the literary point of view.\r\nRichelieu's talents, it is sufficiently notorious, were not literary;\r\nand even if they had been, but little of these memoirs comes from his\r\nown hand. They are the work of secretaries, confidants, and\r\nunder-strappers of all sorts, writing at most from the cardinal's\r\ndictation, and probably in many cases merely constructing _precis_ of\r\ndocuments. There is, therefore, no need to dwell on them.\r\n\r\nIn the memoirs of Arnauld d'Andilly and of his son, the Abbe Arnauld,\r\nthe personal interest and the abundance of anecdote and\r\ncharacter-drawing which characterise the memoir work of the time\r\nreappear; the latter are, indeed, particularly full of them. Those of\r\nthe father are chiefly interesting, as exhibiting the curious mixture of\r\nworldly and spiritual motives which played so large a part in the\r\nhistory of the time. For Arnauld who was the fervent friend and disciple\r\nof Saint Cyran, the practical founder of Jansenism in France, was also\r\nan assiduous courtier of Gaston d'Orleans, and not too well satisfied\r\nwith the results of his courtiership. There are memoirs attributed to\r\nGaston himself, but they are almost certainly the work of another hand;\r\ntheir historical value is not inconsiderable, but they have little\r\nliterary interest. Those of Marie, Duchess de Nemours, and daughter of\r\nthe Duke de Longueville, are short, but among the most interesting of\r\nall those dealing with the Fronde, from the vividness and decision of\r\ntheir personal traits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Motteville.]\r\n\r\nMore important still among the memoirs of this time are those of\r\nFrancoise Bertaut, Madame de Motteville, a member of the family of the\r\npoet Bertaut. She was introduced by her mother, when very young, to Anne\r\nof Austria, and soon became her most intimate confidante. The jealousy\r\nof Richelieu banished her for a time from the court, and she married M.\r\nde Motteville, a man of wealth and position in the civil service of the\r\nprovince of Normandy. Shortly before Richelieu's death she lost her\r\nhusband; and as soon as Anne of Austria succeeded to the regency she was\r\nrecalled to court, and spent her time there during the queen's life. She\r\nsurvived her mistress many years, and was a member of the society of\r\nMadame de Sevigne. She died in 1689. Her memoirs, which were not\r\npublished till many years after her death, contain many curious\r\nrevelations of the court history of the time, for she was not only\r\nintimate with Anne of Austria, but also with the unfortunate Henrietta\r\nMaria of England, and with La Grande Mademoiselle. With the latter she\r\ninterchanged some curious and characteristic letters on a fantastic\r\nproject of Mademoiselle's for founding a new abbey of Thelema. The\r\ngeneral style of her memoirs is sober and intelligent, but it is injured\r\nby the abundance of moral reflections, in matter according to the\r\ntaste, but in manner lacking much of the piquancy, of the time. These\r\nmemoirs are somewhat voluminous, and extend to the death of Anne of\r\nAustria. Madame de Motteville, notwithstanding her affection for her\r\nmistress, is one of the best authorities for the period of the Fronde,\r\nbecause, unlike Retz and La Rochefoucauld, she was only secondarily\r\ninterested in the events she relates. Some curious details of the later\r\nFronde are found in the short memoirs of Pere Berthod, of whom nothing\r\nis known. Of the Comte de Brienne, who was a favourite and minister of\r\nAnne of Austria, and whose book contains much information on foreign,\r\nand especially English affairs; of Montresor and Fontrailles, both\r\nfollowers of Gaston of Orleans, and the latter the author of a relation\r\nof the Cinq Mars conspiracy, short, but minute and striking; of La\r\nChatre, an industrious courtier and intriguer, and a vivid and\r\npicturesque writer, whose work, as will presently be mentioned, became\r\nentangled in a strange fashion with that of La Rochefoucauld; of the\r\ngreat Turenne, a worthy follower of Montluc and Rohan in the art of\r\nmilitary writing, little more than mention can be made. There are some\r\nmilitary memoirs of interest, which go under the name of the Duke of\r\nYork (James II).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cardinal de Retz.]\r\n\r\nThe works and personages of some other writers demand a fuller notice.\r\nPaul de Gondi[256], Cardinal de Retz, who occupies with Saint Simon, and\r\nperhaps La Rochefoucauld, the first place among French memoir-writers of\r\nthe seventeenth century, was born in 1614, and died in 1679. He was a\r\nyounger son of an ancient and noble house, uniting French and Italian\r\nhonours, and was early destined for the church, for which probably no\r\nchurchman ever had less vocation. He intrigued in society and politics,\r\nwas a practised duellist, and though he was not more than seven-or\r\neight-and-twenty at Richelieu's death, had already caballed against him.\r\nHis appointment by Louis XIII., almost on his deathbed, to the\r\ncoadjutorship (involving the reversion) of the archbishopric of Paris,\r\nwhich was then held by his uncle, a very old man of no personal capacity\r\nor influence, put into his hands a formidable political weapon, and he\r\nwas not long in making use of it. He was more than any other man the\r\ninstigator of the Fronde, that singular alliance of the privileged\r\nbourgeoisie of the great towns with the still more privileged nobility\r\nagainst the royal authority as exercised through ministers. The history\r\nof this confused and turbulent period is in great part the biography of\r\nRetz. It is not easy to see that he had any definite political views\r\nexcept the jealousy of Mazarin, which he shared with almost all his\r\norder, an inveterate habit of insubordination, and a still more\r\ninveterate habit of conspiracy. The Fronde was and could have been but a\r\nfailure, and Retz was a failure with it. He was for some time in exile,\r\nbut at last reconciled himself to the inevitable, and even enjoyed some\r\npublic employments under Louis XIV. His principal occupation, however,\r\nwas the payment of his enormous debts, which he effected with an honesty\r\nnot common at the time among his class by rigorously reducing his\r\nexpenditure, selling and mortgaging his numerous benefices, and, as\r\nMadame de Sevigne put it, 'living for his creditors.' He is said thus to\r\nhave paid off four millions of francs, a vast sum for the time.\r\nMeanwhile he was writing the Memoirs which, like the Maxims of his rival\r\nand half-enemy, La Rochefoucauld, unexpectedly gained for him a higher\r\nreputation in literature than he could have hoped for in politics. When\r\na mere boy he had shown in the _Conjuration de Fiesque_ no small\r\nliterary talent, and his sermons deepened the impression. His Memoirs,\r\nhowever, are different in style from both. They are addressed to a lady\r\nfriend, and contain a most extraordinary mixture of anecdote,\r\ndescription, personal satire, moral reflection, and political\r\nportraiture. In the three points of anecdote, portrait-drawing, and\r\nmaxim-making, Retz has no rival except in the acknowledged masters of\r\neach art respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Memoirs of Guy Joly, a lawyer and the friend and confidant of Retz,\r\nin a manner supplement this latter's work. Joly was faithful to his\r\nmaster even in exile, but at last they quarrelled, and the Memoirs do\r\nnot always throw a very favourable light on the proceedings of the\r\nturbulent cardinal. They are very well written. Claude Joly, the uncle\r\nof Guy, an ecclesiastic, has also left anti-Mazarin writings of less\r\nliterary worth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mademoiselle.]\r\n\r\nOf very great importance historically, and by no means unimportant as\r\nliterature, are the Memoirs of Pierre Lenet, a man of business long\r\nattached to the house of Conde. These memoirs are, in fact, memoirs of\r\nthe great Conde himself, until the peace of the Pyrenees. Personal and\r\nliterary interest both appear in a very high degree in the Memoirs of\r\nAnne Marie Louise de Montpensier, commonly called La Grande\r\nMademoiselle. The only daughter of Gaston of Orleans and of the Duchess\r\nde Montpensier, she inherited enormous wealth, and a position which made\r\nit difficult for her to marry any one but a crowned head. In her youth\r\nshe was self-willed, and by no means inclined to marriage, and prince\r\nafter prince was proposed to her in vain. During the Fronde she took an\r\nextraordinary part--heading armies, mounting the walls of Orleans by a\r\nscaling ladder, and saving the routed troops of Conde, after the battle\r\nof the Faubourg Saint Antoine, by opening the gates of Paris to them,\r\nand causing the cannon of the Bastille to cover their flight. Mazarin\r\nnever forgave her this, nor perhaps did Louis XIV. When she was past\r\nmiddle age, Mademoiselle conceived an unfortunate affection for Lauzun,\r\nthen merely a gentleman of the South named Puyguilhem. By dint of great\r\nentreaties she obtained permission from the king to marry him, but the\r\ncombined efforts of the queen and the princes of the blood caused this\r\nto be rescinded, and Lauzun was imprisoned in Pignerol. After many years\r\nMademoiselle purchased his release by making over a great part of her\r\nimmense possessions to Louis' bastard, the Duke du Maine, and secretly\r\nmarried her lover, who was not only younger than herself, but a\r\nnotorious adventurer. He was basely ungrateful, and she separated from\r\nhim before her death. Her memoirs, which are voluminous, contain a\r\nminute history of her singular life, written with not a little egotism,\r\nbut with all the vivacity and individuality of savour which characterise\r\nthe best work of the time. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about them\r\nis that, although entirely occupied with herself and her fortunes,\r\nMademoiselle does not appear either to exaggerate her own merits, or to\r\ndisguise her faults. She photographs herself, which is not common.\r\nValentin Conrart, a man of letters, who figures repeatedly in the\r\nhistory of the time, who was the real founder of the Academy, who\r\npublished but little in his lifetime, and who has only recently been the\r\nsubject of a sufficient study, left memoirs of no great length, but of\r\nvalue in reference to the Fronde. The Marquis de Montglat, of whom not\r\nmuch is known, wrote important military memoirs of the latter portion of\r\nthe Thirty Years' War, and of the campaigns between France and Spain,\r\nwhich continued until the peace of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: La Rochefoucauld.]\r\n\r\nThe Memoirs of La Rochefoucauld[257] would have assured him a\r\nconsiderable place in the history of literature, even had he never\r\nwritten the _Maxims_, and the singular fate of these Memoirs would have\r\ndeserved notice even had they been far less intrinsically interesting in\r\nmatter and style than they are. The seventeenth century was the palmy\r\ntime of literary piracy, and this piracy was facilitated not merely by\r\nthe absence of any international copyright, but by the common habit of\r\ncirculating books in manuscript long before their appearance in print.\r\nThey were thus copied and re-copied, and the number of unauthorised\r\nduplicates made it impossible for the author to protect his work. Not\r\nunfrequently the difficulties of authors were increased by the custom\r\n(inherited from the middle ages) of simultaneously or rather\r\ncontinuously transcribing different works in the same large notebook,\r\nwithout any very scrupulous attention to their separate origin, plan,\r\nand authorship. When La Rochefoucauld, after the conclusion of the\r\nFronde and the triumph of Mazarin, retired in dudgeon and disgrace to\r\nhis estates, he devoted himself to the writing of memoirs, and the fact\r\nsoon became known. He succeeded once in preventing an unauthorised\r\npublication at Rouen. But the Elzevirs (who were as much princes of\r\npiracy as of printing) were beyond his reach, and in 1662 there appeared\r\na book purporting to be the Memoirs of M. L. R. F. This book excited\r\nmuch indignation in the persons commented upon, and La Rochefoucauld\r\nhastened to deny its authenticity, alleging that but a fraction was his,\r\nand that garbled. His denial was very partially credited, and has\r\nremained the subject of suspicion almost to the present day. Probably,\r\nhowever, he was warned by the incident of the danger of this sort of\r\ncontemporary criticism, and no authentic edition was issued. After his\r\ndeath a new turn of ill-luck befell him. A fresh recension of the\r\nMemoirs was published, not indeed quite so incorrect as the first, but\r\nstill largely adulterated, nor was the injustice repaired until 1817,\r\nand then not entirely. It is only within the last few years that the\r\npublication of the Memoirs from a manuscript in the possession of his\r\nrepresentatives has finally established the text, and that laborious\r\nenquiries have demonstrated the conglomerate character of the early\r\neditions (which were made up of the work of La Rochefoucauld, of La\r\nChatre, of Vineuil, and of several other people, even such well-known\r\nwriters as Saint Evremond being laid under contribution), and the\r\njustice of the author's repudiation. The genuine Memoirs are, however,\r\nextremely interesting; they are less full, and perhaps less absolutely\r\nfrank than those of Retz, but they yield to these alone of the Fronde\r\nchronicles in piquancy and interest, while their purely literary merit\r\nis superior. The strange bird's-eye view of conduct and motives which\r\ncharacterises the Maxims is already visible in them, as well as the\r\nprofundity of insight which accompanies width of range. The form is less\r\nfinished, but its capacities are seen.\r\n\r\nJean Herault de Gourville stood to La Rochefoucauld in something like\r\nthe relation which Guy Joly bore to Retz, but was far more fortunate.\r\nBorn at La Rochefoucauld, without any advantages of family or fortune,\r\nhe began as a domestic of its seigneur. He passed from this service to\r\nthat of Conde and Mazarin, held public employments which enriched him,\r\nbecame the friend of Fouquet, and escaped the general ruin which fell on\r\nthe superintendent's friends at his fall, married, it is said, secretly\r\na daughter of the house where he had served in a menial capacity, was\r\nrecalled honourably to his country, discharged important political and\r\ndiplomatic offices, lived on equal terms with the greatest nobles of the\r\ncourt, and died full of years, riches, and honours, in 1703. His\r\nMemoirs, which were written but a short time before his death, were\r\ndictated to a secretary. They are of a somewhat gossiping character, but\r\nfull of curious information. The so-called memoirs of Omer Talon are\r\nreally accounts, written in a stilted and professional style, of the\r\nproceedings of the Parliament of Paris. Henri de Guise, the last, the\r\nleast fortunate, but not the least remarkable of his famous family, has\r\nleft an account of the wild expedition which he made to Naples at the\r\ntime of the revolt of Masaniello, which is somewhat too long for the\r\nsubject. The Memoirs of the Marechal de Grammont were composed from his\r\npapers by his second son, Louvigny, afterwards Duke de Grammont. The\r\neldest son, Count de Guiche, the most accomplished cavalier of the\r\nearlier court of Louis XIV., died before his father. Guiche left a\r\nbrilliant relation (written some say on the spot and at once) of the\r\npassage of the Rhine, an exploit much exaggerated by the king's\r\nflatterers, but which was really a brilliant feat of arms, and was\r\nmainly due to Guiche himself. Like those of Grammont, the Memoirs of the\r\nMarechal du Plessis are not the work of the hero, but in this case a\r\nprofessional man of letters--it is thought Segrais--seems to have been\r\ncalled in. Their somewhat stilted regularity contrasts with the\r\nirregular vigour of most of the work mentioned in this chapter. Some\r\nanonymous _Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire du XVII'eme Siecle_,\r\nthough evidently a compilation, are not destitute of literary merit.\r\nThey seem to be extracted for the most part from works already\r\nmentioned. The Memoirs of La Porte, the valet de chambre of Anne of\r\nAustria and the youthful Louis XIV., are rather important to history\r\nthan to literature. Madame de la Fayette wrote Memoirs of Henrietta, the\r\ndaughter of Charles I., and the first wife of the Duke of Orleans, but\r\nthey are not equal to her novels in merit. The poet-Marquis La Fare\r\nbegan memoirs on an extensive plan, but only completed a small part of\r\nthem. Those of the Duke of Berwick are justly considered models of\r\nsimple straightforward writing, of clear judgment, and of accurate\r\nstatement. The _Souvenirs_ of Madame de Caylus had the honour of having\r\nVoltaire for their first editor, and deserved it. They are purely\r\npersonal, and might even be called frivolous, were it not for the\r\ninterest and historical importance of the society whose manners they\r\ndepict. The memoirs of Torcy give a clear and lucid account of the\r\nnegotiations in which that diplomatist was engaged. Last of this long\r\nlist come three works of value, the memoirs of Villars, Forbin, and\r\nDuguay Trouin. The last two are among the somewhat rare records of\r\nFrench prowess on sea. Both are somewhat boastful, and the memoirs of\r\nForbin, which are the longer and the more amusing of the two, are\r\nsuspected of some inaccuracy. They were not, it appears, the unaided\r\nwork of their nominal authors. The memoirs of Villars are of greater\r\nhistorical importance, and of much literary interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Saint Simon.]\r\n\r\nA few authors, not included in the collection the order of which has\r\nbeen followed, have now to be mentioned. Bussy Rabutin, cousin of Madame\r\nde Sevigne, and one of the boldest, most unscrupulous, and most unlucky\r\nof aspirants after fortune, has left a considerable number of letters\r\nand memoirs in which he exposes his own projects and wrongs, and, above\r\nall, a kind of scandalous chronicle called the _Histoire Amoureuse des\r\nGaules_, in which gossip against all the ladies of the court, not\r\nexcepting his own relations and friends, is pitilessly recorded. Bussy\r\nhad many of the family qualities which show themselves more amiably in\r\nthe cousin whom he libelled. His literary faculty was considerable, his\r\nbrain fertile in invention, and his tongue witty in expression; but he\r\nmade no very good use of his powers. The Marquis de Dangeau[258] has\r\nleft an immense collection of memoirs, describing in the minutest detail\r\nthe etiquette of the court of Louis XIV. and all that happened there for\r\nyears; but he had hardly any faculty of writing, and his work, except\r\nfor its matter, is chiefly remarkable because of the contrast which it\r\npresents to a book which deals with much the same subject, and which has\r\nyet to be noticed. This book, with grave defects and inequalities,\r\nexhibits in the highest degree the merits of the class and period of\r\nliterature which is now under review. These are the skill shown by\r\nwriters in no respect professional, but trained to expression only by\r\nliterary amusements and the conversation of the salons; the keen insight\r\ninto motive and character; the intense interest and power of reflection\r\nwith which contemporary events are taken in and represented.\r\n\r\nLouis de Rouvroy, Duke de Saint Simon[259], was born at La Ferte\r\nVidame, the family seat, in 1675. The family was of very great antiquity\r\nand unblemished _noblesse_, claiming descent from Charlemagne; the\r\ndukedom and the peerage--it is to be remembered that peerage in France\r\nhas, or rather had under the old regime, an entirely different sense\r\nfrom the modern English sense, referring not in the least to the\r\nennobling of the persons enjoying it, but to their admission into a kind\r\nof great council of the kingdom which had indeed long lost its active\r\nfunctions, but retained its dignity--were conferred only on Saint\r\nSimon's father, a favourite and a faithful servant of Louis XIII. His\r\nmother was Charlotte de l'Aubespine, of a family which had much\r\ndistinguished itself for several generations since the days of Francis\r\nthe First. Saint Simon was brought up by the Jesuits, went to the wars\r\nin Flanders at the age of seventeen, and a year later succeeded to the\r\ntitle and estates by the death of his father. Thus at the age of\r\neighteen he found himself in a position theoretically superior to every\r\nman in France except the princes of the blood, and his few brother\r\npeers--theoretically, for the rule of Louis did not admit of any real\r\nexercise of the privileges of the peerage. Saint Simon, however, began\r\nat once to show his devotion to the idol of his whole life--the status\r\nof his order--by going to law with Luxembourg, the famous Marshal, on a\r\nquestion of precedence and title of the most intricate kind. At the\r\nPeace of Ryswick he left the army, to the displeasure of the king; but\r\nhe was none the less constant at court, though he could hardly be called\r\na courtier, and though his inveterate stickling for precedence\r\nfrequently brought down the king's wrath on his head. In 1705 he was\r\nmade ambassador to Rome, but the appointment was almost immediately\r\ncancelled. Many years later, however, a similar, but greater, honour\r\nfell to his lot. The death of Louis put power into the hands of Philippe\r\nd'Orleans, who was a friend of Saint Simon's, and the latter enjoyed the\r\ngreatest triumph of his life by bringing about the degradation of the\r\n'Bastards' (the illegitimate sons of Louis), on whom, to the indignation\r\nof the peers, the king had bestowed the rank and precedence of princes\r\nof the blood. In 1721 Saint Simon went on a special embassy to Spain to\r\narrange the double marriage of Louis XV. to the Infanta, and of the\r\nPrince of the Asturias to the Regent's granddaughter. There he was made\r\na grandee of the first class. Soon after his return he gave up\r\ninterference in public affairs, but he lived for thirty years longer,\r\nwriting incessantly, and died in 1755.\r\n\r\nThe history of his enormous literary productions is curious enough.\r\nNothing was published, and, from the personal nature of most of his\r\nwork, nothing could well be published, during his lifetime. He died\r\nintestate, and with no immediate heirs, and opportunity was taken to\r\nimpound the whole of his manuscripts, amounting to hundreds of volumes.\r\nExtracts from the memoirs were surreptitiously published from time to\r\ntime during the eighteenth century, but it was not till 1839 that the\r\nwhole was fully and faithfully given to the world. These memoirs,\r\nhowever, form relatively but a small part of the vast mass of Saint\r\nSimon's manuscripts, though they fill twenty printed volumes. Until very\r\nrecently obstacles of a not very intelligible character have been thrown\r\nin the way of publication by the French Foreign Office, to which the\r\nMSS. belong; but at length these seem to have been overcome, and three\r\ndifferent workers, M. de Boislisle, M. Drumont, and M. Faugere, have\r\nbeen engaged in editing or re-editing different parts of the total. The\r\nminor works, however, from the specimens already published, would seem\r\nto be of less interest than the memoirs; most of them bearing on the, to\r\nSaint Simon, inexhaustible subject of the privileges of the peerage, and\r\nits place in the hierarchy of government. To discuss these subjects\r\nwould lead us out of our way. It is sufficient to say that it is a great\r\nmistake to regard Saint Simon as a mere selfish aristocrat in the cant\r\nsense. He would have had the kingdom justly and wisely governed for the\r\nbenefit of the whole nation, but he regarded the nobility, and, above\r\nall, the peers, as the pre-destined instruments of government. 'Much for\r\nthe people, but nothing by the people,' was his political motto.\r\n\r\nThe importance of Saint Simon in literature is, however, entirely\r\nindependent of his standpoint as a politician, though that standpoint\r\nwas not without influence on his literary characteristics. He is\r\nvaluable to us as, without exception, the most vivid and graphic painter\r\nof contemporary history of the anecdotic kind in French or any other\r\nlanguage. His style is incorrect, and sometimes barely grammatical, and\r\nall his work bears the character of notes, hurriedly dashed off, rather\r\nthan of a finished and regularly arranged history. Opinions differ as to\r\nhis trustworthiness in matters of fact, but it is certain, from his\r\npositive manner of recounting the incidents and the actual words of\r\ninterviews at which he could not have been present, and as to which he\r\nis not likely to have had more than hearsay information, that his\r\ntestimony is to be received with caution. His prejudices, too, were\r\nextraordinarily strong, and he is in the habit of representing\r\neverything and everybody that he does not like in the blackest possible\r\ncolours. His furious denunciation thus makes a curious contrast to the\r\ngood-humoured malice of the author with whom he is most likely to be\r\ncompared--Madame de Sevigne. But all these drawbacks affect only the\r\nmatter, not the manner of his work. The picture which he has given of\r\nthe inner life of the court of Versailles during the later years of\r\nLouis XIV. is unrivalled in history. Still more extraordinary is the\r\npower of single passages, such especially as the famous one describing\r\nthe Dauphin's death. Saint Simon has often been compared to Tacitus, but\r\nhis torrent of words very little resembles the laconic incisiveness of\r\nthe Roman. A much nearer parallel, though with remarkable differences,\r\nmight be found in the late Mr. Carlyle.\r\n\r\nSome memoirs of great extent and interest, valuable as checking Saint\r\nSimon and Dangeau (whom Saint Simon annotated), have recently appeared\r\nfor the first time, at least in a form that is to be complete. They are\r\nthe work of the Marquis de Sourches[260], a great court officer, and\r\nthey cover the last thirty years of Louis's reign. Their chief literary\r\npeculiarity is the formal and almost official character of the text\r\ncontrasted with the greater freedom of the numerous notes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Sevigne.]\r\n\r\nThe most famous and remarkable of all the letter-writers of the\r\ntime--perhaps the most famous and remarkable of all letter-writers in\r\nliterature--was Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, Marquise de Sevigne[261]. She\r\nwas born at Paris on the 6th of February, 1626, and died at Grignan, of\r\nsmall-pox, on the 10th of August, 1696. Her family was a distinguished\r\none both in war and other ways. Her grandmother was the well-known\r\nSainte Chantal, the pupil of St. Francois de Sales, and her first\r\ncousin, as has been mentioned, was Bussy Rabutin. Her father and mother\r\nboth died when she was very young, and an uncle, not more than twenty\r\nyears older than herself, the Abbe de Coulanges, took charge of her,\r\nremaining, for the greater part of her life, her chief friend and\r\ncounsellor. She soon became a great beauty, and something of a scholar,\r\nthough not of a blue-stocking. Menage and Chapelain had, among others,\r\nmuch to do with her education, and she was a member of the celebrated\r\n_coterie_ of the Hotel Rambouillet, though her satirical humour saved\r\nher from being a _precieuse_. At the age of eighteen she married the\r\nMarquis de Sevigne, of a good and wealthy Breton family. Her husband\r\nwas, however, a selfish profligate, who wasted her substance with Ninon\r\nde l'Enclos, and such-like persons,--though Ninon herself, to do her\r\njustice, never plundered her lovers,--and did not pretend the slightest\r\nreturn for the affection she gave him. He was killed in a duel in 1651,\r\nleaving her with two children, a daughter, Francoise Marguerite, and a\r\nson Charles. After a few years of seclusion she returned to the world,\r\nbeing then in the full possession of her beauty, and only twenty-eight\r\nyears old. She continued for more than forty years to form part of the\r\nbest society of the capital, without suffering the least stain on her\r\nreputation. The selfish vanity of the superintendent Fouquet made him\r\nkeep certain of her letters; but though they were discovered in a casket\r\nwhich was fatal to many of his friends of both sexes, Madame de Sevigne\r\ncame scathless out of the ordeal. In 1669 her daughter, then twenty-two\r\nyears old, married the Count de Grignan, a Provencal gentleman of the\r\nnoblest birth, of great estate, rank, and fortune, but already twice a\r\nwidower, past middle age, plain, and of somewhat embarrassed means,\r\nconsidering the great expenses which, as Governor of Provence, he had to\r\nmeet. He was, however, a man of good sense and probity, and his wife\r\nseems to have been sincerely attached to him. The great bulk of Madame\r\nde Sevigne's voluminous correspondence was addressed to her daughter,\r\nfor whom she had an almost frantic fondness; Charles de Sevigne, though\r\napparently far the more lovable of the two, having but an inferior share\r\nof his mother's affection. The letters to Madame de Grignan are for the\r\nmost part dated either from Paris (in which case they are full of court\r\nnews and gossip), or from Les Rochers, the country seat of the Sevignes,\r\nnear Vitre, in which case they are full of social satire and curious\r\ndetails of the provincial life of that time. One very interesting series\r\ndescribes the habits and regimen of Vichy, which Madame de Sevigne\r\nvisited in consequence of a severe attack of rheumatism. The\r\ncorrespondence thus serves as a minute and detailed history of the\r\nauthor for the last thirty years of her life, except during her rare\r\nvisits to Grignan, in one of which, as has been mentioned, she caught\r\nthe illness which proved fatal to her.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Madame de Sevigne's letters are very numerous.\r\nThose to her daughter especially were garbled in the earlier editions by\r\nomissions, and by the substitution of phrases which seemed to the 18th\r\ncentury more suitable than the fresh nature of the originals. The\r\nedition cited gives the extant MSS. faithfully. The enthusiastic\r\naffection lavished by the mother on the daughter naturally commends\r\nitself differently to different persons. It is certain that if it is not\r\ntedious, it is only due to the extraordinary literary art of the writer,\r\nan art which is at once the most artful and the most artless to be\r\nanywhere found. The only other faults of the letters are an occasional\r\ncrudity of diction (which, however, is, when rightly taken, perfectly\r\ninnocent and even valuable as exemplifying the manners of the time,) and\r\na decided heartlessness in relating the misfortunes of all those in whom\r\nthe writer is not personally interested. Madame de Sevigne has been\r\nblamed for not sympathising more with the oppression of the French\r\npeople during her time. This, however, is an unfair charge. In the first\r\nplace she simply expresses the current political ideas of her day, and,\r\nin the second place, she goes decidedly beyond those ideas in the\r\ndirection of sympathy. Her treatment of some of her own equals leaves\r\nmuch more to desire. The account of Madame de Brinvilliers'\r\nsufferings--unworthy of much pity as the victim was--is callous to\r\nbrutality, and it seems to be sufficient for any one to have ever\r\noffended Madame de Grignan, or to have spoken slightingly of her, to put\r\nhim, or her, out of the pale of even ordinary human sympathy. But no\r\nother fault can be found. For vivid social portraiture the book equals\r\nSaint Simon at his best, while it is far more uniformly good. The\r\nletters describing the engagement of La Grande Mademoiselle to Lauzun,\r\nthe death of Vatel, the trial of Fouquet, the Vichy sojourn, the meeting\r\nof the states of Britanny, and many others, are not to be surpassed in\r\nthis respect. Unlike Saint Simon, too, Madame de Sevigne has no fixed\r\nidea--except that of Madame de Grignan's perfections, which rarely\r\ninterferes--to prevent her from taking fresh, original, and acute views\r\nof things in general as distinguished from mere court intrigues. Her\r\nliterary criticism is excellent, and if she somewhat overvalues\r\nmoralists like Nicole and novelists like Mademoiselle de Scudery, who\r\nministered to her peculiar tastes, her remarks on the great preachers,\r\non La Fontaine, on Corneille and Racine, display a singular insight as\r\nwell as a singular power of expression. She is, indeed, except in\r\npolitics, on which few persons of her class had at the time any clear or\r\ndistinct ideas, never superficial; and this union of just thought with\r\naccurate observation and exceptional power of expression makes her\r\nposition in literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tallemant des Reaux.]\r\n\r\nMadame de Sevigne, so to speak, dwarfs all other letter-writers of her\r\ntime. Yet many of those already mentioned under the head of memoirs left\r\nletters which have been preserved, and which are of merit. It is,\r\nhowever, not necessary to specify any except Madame de Maintenon, whose\r\ncorrespondence is voluminous and important both as history and as\r\nliterature. It has not the charm of Madame de Sevigne, but it displays\r\nthe great intellectual powers of the writer[262]. Of a very different\r\nkind, but not less worthy of notice are the letters of Guy Patin, which\r\nare for the most part violent _Mazarinades_, and full of scandalous\r\nanecdotes, but full also of lively wit. Scandal, indeed, was very much\r\nthe order of the day, as appears from the large and curious collection\r\nof broadsheets and pamphlets republished by the late M. Fournier in his\r\n_Varietes Historiques et Litteraires_[263]. These, most of which refer\r\nto the present period, form a kind of appendix to historical and\r\nbiographical writing of the more serious kind. There is, however, one\r\nremarkable work which remains to be noticed, and which, for want of a\r\nbetter place for it, must be noticed here, the _Historiettes_ of\r\nTallemant des Reaux[264]. The author of this singular book, Gedeon\r\nTallemant des Reaux, was born at La Rochelle about 1619, and died in\r\n1692. He was of a family not noble but wealthy and well connected, and\r\nhe himself was able, by marriage with a cousin who was an heiress, to\r\nlive without any profession, and to purchase an estate and seignory of\r\nsome importance. Little, however, is known of his life except that he\r\nwas much at the Hotel de Rambouillet in his youth, and that in his old\r\nage he underwent some not clearly defined misfortune or disgrace. The\r\n_Historiettes_ were written in the years immediately preceding 1660, and\r\nform an almost complete commentary on the persons most celebrated in\r\nsociety and literature for three quarters of a century before that date.\r\nThere is no other book to which they can be exactly compared, though\r\nthey have, with much less literary excellence, a certain resemblance in\r\nform to the work of Brantome. They are, as published by Monmerque, 376\r\nin number, filling five (nominally ten) stout volumes. Each is as a rule\r\nheaded with the name of a single person, though there are a few general\r\nor subject headings. The articles themselves are not regular\r\nbiographies, but collections of anecdotes, not unfrequently of the most\r\nscandalous kind. Tallemant, though by no means of small ability, appears\r\nto have been a somewhat malicious person, and not too careful to examine\r\nthe value of the stories he tells, especially when they bear heavily on\r\nthe old nobility, of whom, as a new man, he was very jealous. Yet his\r\nsources of information were in many cases good, and his statements are\r\nconfirmed by independent evidence sufficiently often to show that, if\r\nthey are in other cases to be accepted with caution, they are not the\r\nwork of a mere libeller. No one, even in that century of unstinted\r\npersonal revelations, has taken us so much behind the scenes, and\r\ncertainly no one has left a more amusing book of its kind or (with the\r\nproper precautions) a more valuable one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical Antiquaries.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Du Cange.]\r\n\r\nThe class of learned investigators into the sources of history cannot be\r\nomitted in any account of French literature; though their work was\r\nchiefly in Latin, and though even when it was not it was rather of value\r\nas material for future literature than as literature itself. This\r\ncentury and the earlier part of the succeeding one were the palmy time\r\nof really laborious erudition--the work of the Benedictines and\r\nBollandists, and of many isolated writers worthy of being ranked with\r\nthe members of these famous communities. The individuals composing this\r\nclass are, however, too numerous, and, from the purely literary view,\r\ntoo unimportant to detain us. Exceptions may be made in favour of Andre\r\nDuchesne, whose collections of French and Norman Chronicles, and his\r\ngenealogical histories of the houses of Laval and Vergi, are valuable\r\nexamples of their kind; of Mabillon, famous for his labours in\r\nhagiology, in the history of France, and above all in that of Italy; and\r\nlastly, of Du Cange. The last-named has a special right to a place here\r\nbecause, both directly and indirectly, he did much towards the\r\nrediscovery of old French literature. Du Cange was his seignorial style,\r\nhis personal name being Charles Dufresne. He devoted himself to the\r\nstudy of the middle ages generally, and particularly of the Byzantine\r\nEmpire. He edited Joinville, wrote a history of the Latin Empire, and in\r\nhis most famous work, the _Glossarium Mediae et Infimae Latinitatis_,\r\ncontributed not a little to the study of the oldest form of French.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[253] The following paragraph contains, except as far as Mezeray is\r\nconcerned, chiefly second-hand information. I have hitherto been unable\r\nto devote the time necessary to enable me to speak at first hand of\r\nthese books, which are very bulky, not as a rule interesting or\r\nimportant in manner, and for the most part long obsolete in matter.\r\n\r\n[254] The legend, familiar probably to most readers, is that Vertot\r\nrequired documents for his account of a certain military operation.\r\nTired with waiting for them, he constructed the history out of his own\r\nhead, and when they arrived made the ejaculation in the text.\r\n\r\n[255] This, with some other of the pieces here mentioned, will be found\r\nin two volumes of the _Collection Didot_, entitled _Petits Chefs\r\nd'oeuvre Historiques_.\r\n\r\n[256] Ed.

But Montaigne's influence on the production of short\r\npieces, complete in themselves and having for the most part an ethical\r\nbearing, was supplemented by the feature of the time so often referred\r\nto, the fancy for literary _coteries_, and for wit combats between the\r\nmembers of those _coteries_. For this latter purpose pieces of moderate\r\nlength in prose, corresponding to the sonnets, the madrigals, and\r\nsuch-like things in verse, were well suited. The Academy, too, with its\r\ncompetitions and its ordinary critical occupations, stimulated literary\r\nproduction in the same direction. The essay was therefore much\r\ncultivated in the seventeenth century, and not a few minor styles of\r\ncomposition descended from it. Such were the _Pensee_, a short essay on\r\nsome definite and briefly handled point; the _Conversation_, an essay or\r\nsketch in dialogue; the _Portrait_, a sketch of personal character; the\r\n_Maxime_, a condensed _Pensee_, just as the _Pensee_ was a condensed\r\nessay. In these various styles some of the most excellent work existing\r\nin French literature was composed during the time which we are at\r\npresent handling; and four names of the first, or almost the first rank\r\nin literary history, Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, La Bruyere, and Saint\r\nEvremond, belong to this division, besides not a few others of less\r\nimportance. Pascal, indeed, might be almost as well treated in either of\r\nthe two following chapters as in the present; but if the substance of\r\nhis work is for the most part philosophical or theological, the form of\r\nit seems to fall more suitably under the present head. He does not,\r\nhowever, open the series of Essayists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Balzac.]\r\n\r\nSomething of Montaigne's manner, as well as of his peculiar sceptical\r\ndoubt, which nevertheless does not transcend the limits of orthodoxy,\r\nwas continued far into the century by La Mothe le Vayer, a man of\r\ntalent, but of some deliberate eccentricity and archaism in costume and\r\nmanners as in style. But the most important name in the history of\r\nFrench prose next after that of Montaigne is that of Jean Guez de\r\nBalzac, who occupies nearly the same place in it as Malherbe does in\r\nthat of French poetry. Balzac was a gentleman of rank and fortune in the\r\nprovince of Angoumois, where he was born towards the end of the\r\nsixteenth century, and where he died in 1655. In his younger days he\r\nserved in some diplomatic employments, then for a long time resided in\r\nParis, and finally retired to his country seat. Balzac's works are\r\nalmost entirely of the essay character, though they are sufficiently\r\ndiverse, and for the most part rather artificial in form. The most\r\nconsiderable part of them is composed of letters--not such letters as\r\nhave been discussed in the preceding chapter, but elaborate epistles\r\nwritten deliberately for the sake of writing, and with a definite\r\nattempt at style. Besides these, which are very numerous, Balzac was\r\nalso the author of discourses on various subjects and of certain\r\nnondescript works of an ethico-political character, the principal and\r\nbest known of which is the _Socrate Chretien_. In all, his work was\r\nsufficient to fill two folio volumes when it was collected[265]. Balzac\r\nis a really remarkable figure in literary history, because he is, in his\r\nown tongue and nation, almost the first person who deliberately wrote\r\nfor the sake of writing, and not because he had anything particular to\r\nsay. The practice is perhaps not one to be commended to the general run\r\nof men at any time, or even to exceptional men, except at a peculiar\r\ntime. But done as it was, and when it was, Balzac's work was really of\r\nimportance and advantage to his countrymen. The prose literature of the\r\nsixteenth century had been admirable, but it had not resulted in the\r\nelaboration of any general style of all work. Each writer had followed\r\nhis instincts, and when those instincts were under the guidance of\r\ngenius, as they frequently were, many writers had produced admirable\r\nresults. But the general use of the printing press, and the adaptation\r\nof literature to all sorts of journey-work, made it imperatively\r\nnecessary that the tools should be put ready fashioned into the hands of\r\nordinary workmen instead of each man having to manufacture them for\r\nhimself. Various steps had been taken in this direction. Guillaume du\r\nVair had already written a _Traite de l'Eloquence Francaise_; Vaugelas,\r\na Savoyard by birth, was shortly to undertake some valuable _Remarques_\r\non French grammar and style, which long remained a standard book. But\r\nnot many examples of deliberate composition had been given. It was these\r\nexamples of deliberate composition which Balzac furnished, and which, in\r\na lighter and more graceful fashion, and to a more limited circle, were\r\nalso given by the letters of the poet Voiture. Balzac, as is natural in\r\nthe first attempts at a polished prose style, has the drawback of being\r\nsomewhat rhetorical and occasionally ponderous. But the important point\r\nis that the mechanism of the clause, the sentence, and the paragraph has\r\nevidently been considered by him, and that he has succeeded in getting\r\nit into very tolerable condition. His sentences no longer run on to the\r\ninterminable length of earlier writers, or finish in the haphazard\r\nmanner, neglectful of rhythm, balance, and proportion, also noticeable\r\nin his predecessors. The substitution of the full stop for the\r\nconjunction, which, speaking generally, may be said to be the initiating\r\nsecret of style (though of course it must not be applied too\r\nindiscriminately), is at once apparent in Balzac's best passages, and he\r\nrarely falls into the error which waits on this substitution, the error\r\nof scrappiness. His style is perhaps better suited to oratory than to\r\nwriting; a not unlikely result, since his models were pretty obviously\r\nthe classical orators. But there can be no doubt that to him in no small\r\npart is due the extraordinary outburst of rhetorical power which\r\ndistinguished the preachers of the latter half of the century. Nor was\r\nit long before what was faulty in Balzac's style was corrected by the\r\nexample of very different writers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pascal.]\r\n\r\nBlaise Pascal[266] was born at Clermont, in Auvergne, on the 19th of\r\nJune, 1623. His father was President of the Court of Aids, but when the\r\nboy was eight years old the family moved to Paris. Pascal was one of the\r\nsmall number of extraordinarily precocious children who have justified\r\ntheir precocity by genius equally extraordinary in after-life; but it\r\ndoes not appear that he was forced by his father (who took the whole\r\ncharge of his education), and it is said that he did not begin Latin\r\nuntil he was twelve years old--a very late age for the time.\r\nMathematics, however, were his chief study and delight, and he early\r\nexcelled in them, showing also an extraordinary faculty in applying them\r\nto physics. At nineteen he invented a calculating machine. But his\r\napplication to study did not improve his health. He was but\r\nfive-and-twenty at the time of his famous experiment with the barometer\r\non the Puy de Dome in his native province. He was soon exposed to the\r\nphilosophical influence of Descartes on the one hand, and the\r\ntheological influence of the Jansenists on the other, and he felt both\r\ndeeply. His greatest work, the _Provinciales_, appeared in 1656. He died\r\non the 19th of August, 1662, having long lived in retirement and\r\nasceticism, giving much of his substance to the poor, and abandoning\r\nhimself almost entirely to religious, mathematical, and philosophical\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing to do here with his purely mathematical works or those\r\nin natural science. The two books by which he belongs to literature, and\r\nwhich have placed him among the foremost writers of his country, are the\r\n_Provinciales_ and the so-called _Pensees_. The former were regularly\r\npublished by himself in his lifetime, though they were ostensibly\r\nanonymous, or rather pseudonymous. The _Pensees_ consist of scattered\r\nreflections, which were found in his papers after his death. They were\r\npublished, but, as has been discovered of late years, with much omission\r\nand garbling, and the restoration of them to their authentic form has\r\nbeen effected in comparatively recent times.\r\n\r\nThe famous title of _Les Provinciales_ is only a convenient abbreviation\r\nof the original, which is _Lettres Ecrites par Louis de Montalte a un\r\nProvincial de ses Amis et aux Reverends Peres Jesuites sur le Sujet de\r\nla Morale et de la Politique de ces Peres_. This somewhat cumbrous\r\nappellation has at any rate the merit of exactly describing the\r\ncontents of the book, except that Louis de Montalte is of course a\r\npseudonym. The letters were written at the height of the early struggle\r\n(which had not yet been interfered with by the secular arm) of\r\nJansenists and Jesuits, and they inflicted on the famous society a blow\r\nfrom which it has never wholly recovered, and from which it can never\r\nwholly recover. The method and style of Pascal are entirely original,\r\nexcept in so far as a slight trace of indebtedness to Descartes may be\r\nobserved in the first respect, and a slight debt to Montaigne and the\r\n_Satire Menippee_ in the second. His great weapon is polite irony, which\r\nhe first brought to perfection, and in the use of which he has hardly\r\nbeen equalled and has certainly not been surpassed since. The intricate\r\ncasuistries of the Jesuits are unfolded in the gravest fashion and\r\nwithout the least exaggeration or burlesque, but with a running comment\r\nor rather insinuation of sarcasm which is irresistible. The author never\r\nbreaks out into a laugh, never allows himself to be declamatory and\r\nindignant. There is always a smile on his countenance, but never\r\nanything more pronounced than a smile. Yet the contempt of this is more\r\ncrushing than that of the bitterest invective. In the later letters\r\nindeed the mask of irony is to a certain extent dropped, and a more\r\nserious tone is taken. But effective as these are they are not the most\r\neffective part of the _Provinciales_. That part is the earlier one, in\r\nwhich, without dry scholastic argument, without the coarse abuse which\r\nthe sixteenth century had regarded as inseparable from theological\r\ncontroversy, and at the same time with almost absolute accuracy of\r\nstatement--for the misrepresentations which two centuries of eager and\r\nable apologists for the Order have been able to detect are\r\ninsignificant--the author carried the discussion out of the schools into\r\nthe drawing-room, made every man of fair education and breeding a judge\r\nof it, and triumphantly brought the judgment of the vast majority of\r\nsuch men on his side. To this day Pascal, with Swift and Courier, is the\r\ngreatest example in modern literature of irony, excelling Swift as much\r\nin elegance and good-breeding as he falls short of him in sombre force,\r\nand having the advantage over his brilliant follower at the beginning of\r\nthis century in depth and nobility of thought.\r\n\r\nThe _Pensees_ supply the reverse side of Pascal's character, and the\r\nsupplement to any proper estimate of his literary genius. But from the\r\ncircumstances already referred to, they are evidence of a less complete\r\nthough an even more genuine kind than the _Provinciales_. The scepticism\r\nwhich ate so deeply into the heart of the seventeenth century affected\r\nPascal, though he rarely wavered in point of abstract faith. To few men,\r\nhowever, was doubt more painful, and as no clearer or more piercing\r\nintellect has ever existed, so to none was doubt more constantly\r\npresent. The _Pensees_ in their genuine form exhibit the thoughts to\r\nwhich this conflict of opinion gave rise in him, and are in remarkable\r\ncontrast with the polished and sedate badinage of the letters. But few\r\nif any of them are finally worked up into the form in which the author\r\nwould have been likely to present them to the public, and therefore,\r\nfrom the point of view of pure literary criticism, they require less\r\nnotice here than the sister volume.\r\n\r\nThe revolution, as far as style is concerned, which in point of time is\r\nalready noticeable in Descartes, has entirely accomplished itself in\r\nPascal. The last vestige of archaism, of quaintness of phrase, of\r\nclumsiness in the architecture of the sentence or the paragraph, has\r\npassed away. Indeed, it can hardly be said that two centuries have added\r\nmuch to the language except in point of richness and adaptation to the\r\nmore multifarious needs of the describer in modern times. The style is\r\nextremely simple, but it has none of the monotony, the lack of colour,\r\nand the stereotyped form which are the great drawbacks of French after\r\nBoileau as contrasted with French before him. It is extraordinarily\r\ngraphic, sparkling with epigram at every point, and yet never\r\nsacrificing sense to the play of words. The _Pensees_ (which it must\r\nalways be remembered were never finally worked up) yield matter which\r\nwill compare with the carefully concocted Maxims of La Rochefoucauld or\r\nof Joubert, while the _Provinciales_ are, as has been said,\r\nunsurpassable in their own line. It is probable that most good judges\r\nwould allot to Pascal in French the place which Dryden occupies in\r\nEnglish, that is to say, the place of the writer who combines most of\r\nthe advantages of the elder and younger manners. But Pascal, who wrote\r\nmerely to please himself, had this great advantage over Dryden, that his\r\nwork contains no mere journey-work, and especially nothing unworthy of\r\nhim. Admirable as it is in style, it is equally admirable in meaning and\r\nin adaptation to that meaning, and it has thus both the sources of\r\nlasting popularity at command. Dealing, moreover, as it does with\r\nsubjects of perennial importance and interest, it is almost entirely\r\nexempt from the necessity of comment and explanation which weighs down\r\nmuch admirable work of past ages. No man, however indisposed to serious\r\nreading, can put down the _Provinciales_ as dull; no man, however\r\nunwilling to read anything that is not serious, can complain of levity\r\nin the _Pensees_. There are few authors in any language who unite as\r\nPascal does the claims of importance of subject, charm of style, and\r\nbulk, without too great voluminousness of production. He has, moreover,\r\nthe additional merit of being in a high degree representative of his\r\nage. That age had grown too complex for one man to reflect the whole of\r\nit, but Pascal and Moliere (with perhaps Saint Evremond or La\r\nRochefoucauld as thirdsman) supply an almost complete reflection.\r\n\r\nSaint Evremond[267], who was thirteen years Pascal's senior, and who\r\noutlived him by more than forty years, was, in almost every respect\r\nexcept intellectual vigour and literary faculty, his opposite. He was a\r\nNorman by birth (Charles de Marguetel de Saint Denis was his proper\r\nname), and was born in 1610. He was educated by the Jesuits, entered the\r\narmy early, served through the later campaigns of the Thirty Years' War\r\nand in the Fronde, was a favourite of Conde's but fell into disgrace\r\nwith him, and after the fall of Fouquet, which led to the discovery of\r\nhis very able and very uncourtly letter on the Peace of the Pyrenees,\r\nalso incurred the king's displeasure. This displeasure is said to have\r\nbeen aggravated by his notorious membership of the freethinking and\r\nmaterialist school which Gassendi, if he had not founded it, had helped\r\nto spread. Saint Evremond was practically if not formally banished, and\r\nthe time of his misfortune coinciding pretty nearly with the\r\nRestoration in England, he made his way thither, was well received by\r\nthe king and his courtiers, many of whom he had known in their exile,\r\nand dwelt in London for almost the whole remainder of his long life. He\r\ndied in 1703, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. His works are almost\r\nentirely occasional, consisting of 'conversations,' letters,\r\n'portraits,' short literary disquisitions and tractates on subjects of\r\nhistorical and ethical interest. They display a placid epicurean\r\nphilosophy which in its indifference to the assaults of fortune is not\r\ndestitute of nobility, an extraordinary catholicity and acuteness of\r\nliterary judgment, and remarkable wit and _finesse_. The _Conversation\r\ndu Pere Canaye_, which is of the same date as the _Provinciales_, is\r\nworthy of Pascal for its irony, and possesses a certain air of being\r\nwritten by a 'person of quality,' which Saint Evremond could throw over\r\nhis writings better almost than any one else. His Portraits, not always\r\nflattering, are full of nervous vigour. But his literary remarks are\r\nperhaps the most surprising of his works. At a time when English\r\nliterature was almost unknown in France, and when Boileau ostentatiously\r\npretended never to have heard of Dryden, Saint Evremond, perhaps with\r\nsome assistance from his friend Waller, drew up some masterly remarks on\r\nthe humour-comedy of the Jonson school. His criticisms of French plays,\r\nas compared with classical tragedy and comedy, are also full of pregnant\r\nthought; and some comparative studies of his on Corneille and Racine\r\nshow a power of detachment and independence which may be due in some\r\npart to the cosmopolitanism given by residence abroad, but which is\r\ncertainly due also to native power. From the point of view of literary\r\nhistory, however, Saint Evremond is perhaps most remarkable as having\r\nformed, in conjunction with Pascal and Bayle, a singular trio, which\r\nsupplied Voltaire with the models[268] whence he drew his peculiar style\r\nof persiflage. As far as form is concerned, it may be fairly said that\r\nSaint Evremond was the most influential of the three. Like many other\r\nmen of his time he rarely published anything in the ordinary way, and it\r\nwas not till very late in life that he empowered Desmaizeaux to issue\r\nan authorised edition of work that had either circulated in manuscript\r\nor been piratically printed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: La Rochefoucauld.]\r\n\r\nFrancois de Marcillac[269], Duke de la Rochefoucauld, was born in 1613\r\nof one of the noblest families of France. His father had just been\r\ncreated duke and peer, the highest honour possible to a French subject,\r\nand for many years the son was known under the title of Prince de\r\nMarcillac. He was very imperfectly educated, but was early sent to serve\r\nin the army and introduced to the court. Young as he was, he was deeply\r\nengaged in the various intrigues against Richelieu, chiefly in\r\nconsequence of his affection for the celebrated Madame de Chevreuse.\r\nAfter Richelieu's death and the comparative effacement of Madame de\r\nChevreuse, he transferred his affections to Madame de Longueville and\r\nhis aversion to Mazarin. He was one of the chiefs of the Princes' party,\r\nand fought all through the Fronde, winning a reputation, not so much for\r\nmilitary skill as for the most reckless bravery. The establishment of\r\nthe royal authority first sent him into retirement, and then reduced him\r\nto the position of an ordinary courtier. This last period of his life\r\nwas distinguished by a third attachment to a lady hardly less celebrated\r\nthan either of his former loves, Madame de la Fayette, the author of _La\r\nPrincesse de Cleves_, in which novel he is said to figure under another\r\nname. He was also an intimate friend of Madame de Sevigne. In the latter\r\npart of his life he suffered terribly from gout, and died of that\r\ndisease in 1680.\r\n\r\nHis Memoirs have been already noticed. The more famous and far more\r\nremarkable Maxims were published shortly afterwards, and at once\r\nattained a wide popularity. The first edition appeared in 1665, and four\r\nothers were published, with considerable alterations and additions,\r\nduring the author's lifetime, in 1666, 1671, 1675, and 1678. After his\r\ndeath a sixth edition was published by Claude Barbin, containing fifty\r\nnew maxims, the authenticity of which is uncertain but probable.\r\n\r\nThe fullest authoritative edition of La Rochefoucauld's Maxims contains\r\n504 separate paragraphs, to which, besides the fifty just noticed, about\r\nanother fifty can be added by restoring those which the author\r\nsuppressed during his lifetime. The last, which is avowedly a kind of\r\nappendix, and on a different plan from the others, extends to a couple\r\nof pages. But the average length of the remainder is not more than three\r\nor four lines, and many do not contain more than a dozen words. The art\r\nof compressing thought and then pointedly expressing it has never been\r\npushed so far except by Joubert, and hardly even by him. All La\r\nRochefoucauld's maxims, without exception, are on ethical subjects, and\r\nwith a certain allowance they may be said to be generally concerned with\r\nthe reduction of the motives and conduct of men to the single principle\r\nof self-love. In consequence, accusations of misanthropy, of unfairness,\r\nof short-sightedness, have been showered upon the author by those who do\r\nnot like a spade to be called a spade. We have nothing to do with the\r\nmoral side of the matter here, and it is sufficient to say that La\r\nRochefoucauld is not an advocate of the selfish or any other school of\r\nmoralists. He is simply an observer, setting down with the utmost\r\nliterary skill the results of a long life of unusual experience in\r\nbusiness and pleasure of every kind. He is a man of science who has got\r\ntogether a large collection of facts, and who expounds and arranges them\r\non a certain coherent and sufficient hypothesis. As a work of literary\r\nart the result of his exposition is unrivalled. The whole of the Maxims,\r\neven with the doubtful or rejected ones, need not occupy more than a\r\nhundred pages, and they contain matter which in the hands of an ordinary\r\nwriter would have filled a dozen volumes. Yet there is no undue\r\ncompression. It is impossible ever to mistake the meaning, though the\r\ncomprehension of the full application of that meaning depends, of\r\ncourse, on the intellectual equipment and social experience of the\r\nreader. The clearness with which Descartes had first endowed French is\r\nhere displayed in its very highest degree. The style, as was unavoidable\r\nin work of the kind, is entirely devoid of ornament. Imagery is wholly\r\nabsent, and though metaphorical expressions abound, they are of the\r\nplainest and simplest kind of metaphor. The philosophical language of\r\nthe day is present, but in no very prominent measure. The motto of the\r\nbook (at least in the fourth and fifth editions), 'Nos vertus ne sont le\r\nplus souvent que des vices deguises,' is a very fair example of the\r\nsimple straightforward fashion of La Rochefoucauld's style. Sometimes,\r\nbut rarely, the author explains his meaning, and slightly lengthens his\r\nphrase by repeating the sentiment in a somewhat different form, as thus,\r\n'Le plaisir de l'amour est d'aimer, et l'on est plus heureux par la\r\npassion qu'on a que par celle que l'on donne.' But even here it is to be\r\nobserved that the explanation is in a manner necessary to take off the\r\nair of sententious enigma, which the words 'le plaisir de l'amour est\r\nd'aimer' might have had by themselves. La Rochefoucauld is never\r\nenigmatical, rarely sententious merely, and is almost indifferent to the\r\nproduction of _mots_. How continually the study of brevity, combined\r\nwith precision, occupied the author, and how severe he was on any\r\nexuberance, can be seen very instructively in the successive alterations\r\nof his work. Thus, in the first edition Maxim 295 ran, 'La jeunesse est\r\nune ivresse continuelle, c'est la fievre de la sante, c'est la folie de\r\nla raison;' but La Rochefoucauld seems to have thought this unduly\r\npleonastic, and it appears later as 'La jeunesse est une ivresse\r\ncontinuelle, c'est la fievre de la raison,' the improvement of which in\r\npoint and freshness is sufficiently obvious. The result of this process\r\nis that the best of these Maxims are absolutely unrivalled in their own\r\npeculiar style, and that all subsequent writers in the same style have\r\ntaken their form as a model. French critics have, as a rule, rather\r\nunder-than over-estimated the purely literary talent of La\r\nRochefoucauld. But this is due to two causes: first, to the supposed\r\nantagonism of his spirit to conventional morality; secondly, to the fact\r\nthat he somewhat anticipated the writers of the particular period which\r\nfor a century and a half was the idol of academic criticism. His\r\nlanguage is rather that of Louis XIII. than of Louis XIV., and in his\r\nwords and phrases there is a certain archaism, not to say an occasional\r\nirregularity, which critics who look only at the stop-watch apparently\r\nfind it hard to forgive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: La Bruyere.]\r\n\r\nThese critics generally give the palm of style, as concerns writing of\r\nthis kind, to Jean de la Bruyere[270]. Less is known of the personal\r\nhistory of this author than of that of any contemporary writer of great\r\neminence. He was born at Paris, in August 1645, and his family appears\r\nto have been anciently connected with the law. He must have been a man\r\nof some means and of good education, for he had just bought himself an\r\nimportant financial post at Caen, when, on the recommendation of\r\nBossuet, he was appointed Historical Preceptor to Duke Louis of Bourbon,\r\nthe grandson of Conde, in whose household he continued till his death in\r\n1696. He had published his _Caracteres_ in 1687, and was elected to the\r\nAcademy in 1693.\r\n\r\nThe works of La Bruyere consist of the _Caracteres_ just mentioned, of a\r\ntranslation of Theophrastus, of a few literary discourses, and\r\n(probably) of some chapters on Quietism, written on the side of his\r\npatron Bossuet during the great controversy with Fenelon, but not\r\npublished till after the author's death. The _Caracteres_ alone are of\r\nmuch importance or interest.\r\n\r\nThe design of this curious and celebrated book is taken, like its title,\r\nfrom Theophrastus, but the plan is very much altered as well as\r\nextended. Instead of copying directly the abstract qualities of\r\nTheophrastus and his brief, pregnant, but somewhat artificial and jejune\r\ndescription of them, La Bruyere adopted a scheme much better suited to\r\nhis own age. He took for the most part actual living people, well known\r\nto all his readers, and, disguising them thinly under names of the kind\r\nwhich the romances of the middle of the century had rendered\r\nfashionable, made them body forth the characters he wished to define and\r\nsatirise. These portraits he inserted in a framework not altogether\r\nunlike that of the Montaigne essay, preserving no very consecutive plan,\r\nbut passing from moral reflection to literary criticism, and from\r\nliterary criticism to one of the half-personal, half-moralising\r\nportraits just mentioned, with remarkable ease and skill. The titles of\r\nhis chapters are rather more indicative of their actual contents than\r\nthose of Montaigne's essays, but they represent, for the most part,\r\nmerely very elastic frames, in which the author's various observations\r\nand reflections are mounted. The result of this variety, not to say\r\ndesultoriness, combined as it is with the display of very great literary\r\nart, is that La Bruyere's is a book of almost unparalleled interest to\r\ntake up and lay down at odd moments. Its apparently continuous form and\r\nits intermixture of narrative save it from the appearance of severity\r\nwhich the avowed Maxim or Pensee has; while the bond between the\r\ndifferent chapters, and even the different paragraphs, is so slight that\r\ninterruption is not felt to be annoying. Even now, when the zest of\r\npersonal malice, which, as Malezieux remarked to the author, made him\r\nsure beforehand of 'plenty of readers and plenty of enemies,' is past,\r\nit is a most interesting book to read; and it is especially interesting\r\nto Englishmen, because there is no doubt that the English essayists of\r\nthe Queen Anne school directly modelled themselves upon it.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to La Bruyere that he is less of a thinker than of\r\na clever writer, and there is truth in the objection. He was possessed\r\nof a remarkable shrewdness, common sense, and soundness of taste; thus,\r\nfor instance, he protests energetically against the foolish pedantry\r\nwhich rejected as obsolete many of the most useful and most picturesque\r\nwords in French, and so sets himself directly against the dominant and\r\nvery unfortunate literary influence of his time, that of Boileau. Yet he\r\nhimself wrote in the fashionable style, and in the language rather of\r\nRacine than of Corneille. A further objection, also a just one, is that\r\nhis characters are too much of their age and not of all time. This\r\nobjection, indeed, applies to almost all writers after 1660, except\r\nMoliere, and La Fontaine, and La Rochefoucauld. But La Bruyere (though\r\nthere are some sarcastic insinuations which seem to hint that his range\r\nwas wider than he chose to show) is as unwilling to disentangle himself\r\nfrom Versailles and Paris as his English followers are to extend their\r\ngaze to something beyond 'the town.' Nor is there the force and vigour\r\nabout La Bruyere's moral reflections that there is about La\r\nRochefoucauld's. They are frequently commonplace, sometimes even\r\nplatitudinous, and the author occasionally falls into what is perhaps\r\nthe most dangerous pitfall for a moralist and social satirist, the\r\nadoption of stock butts and types. It is indeed most probable that La\r\nBruyere was one of those who, according to a famous phrase of his enemy\r\nand successor, Fontenelle, 'may have their hands full of truth, but may\r\nnot care to open more than their little finger.' He was not, like La\r\nRochefoucauld, a great noble with the liberty of the Fronde in his mind,\r\nbut a man of no exalted rank, living in the most absolute period of\r\nLouis the Fourteenth's rule. His remark that 'les grands sujets sont\r\ndefendus' is a pregnant one, especially when it is remembered how near\r\nto the 'grands sujets' (as, for instance, in his oblique denunciation of\r\nthe misery of the French peasantry) he sometimes goes. But his style,\r\nthough looser than that of his forerunner, and destitute of the\r\ncharacter of sharp and enduring sculpture which is impressed on the\r\n_Maxims_, is a model of ease, grace, and fluency without weakness[271].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[265] He has not recently been re-edited, but a selection was published\r\nin 1822.\r\n\r\n[266] Editions of Pascal are numerous, but a complete and definite one\r\nis still wanting. Of the _Pensees_, etc., the editions of Faugere,\r\nHavet, and Rocher may be mentioned; of the _Provinciales_, the edition\r\nof 1867.\r\n\r\n[267] Ed. Giraud. 3 vols. Paris, 1866. (A selection only, but containing\r\nalmost everything of importance.)\r\n\r\n[268] Perhaps Anthony Hamilton should be added, as a channel of\r\ncommunication with Saint Evremond and some of the seventeenth century\r\ncoterie-writers.\r\n\r\n[269] Ed. as before noticed. The _Maxims_ have been constantly reprinted\r\nby themselves.\r\n\r\n[270] Ed. Servois. Paris, 1865-1882.\r\n\r\n[271] Under the head of this chapter, in an exhaustive history, not a\r\nfew classes of writers might be ranged. Such are, besides great numbers\r\nof miscellaneous writers of criticism from Corneille in his _Examens_\r\ndownwards, the classical commentators, editors, and translators. Few of\r\nthese have left a very enduring reputation. In the earlier part of the\r\ncentury Perrot d'Ablancourt, a fertile translator, may be mentioned. His\r\nwork was so free that his versions were called 'les belles infideles,'\r\nbut Boileau himself admitted that he was a master of French style. In\r\nthe latter part the best-known and perhaps the most remarkable name is\r\nthat of the still famous Madame Dacier. Many of the early members of the\r\nAcademy, and some who never attained to its ranks, have left a\r\nreputation more anecdotic than strictly literary, such as Menage (a\r\nrepresentative of the class), Cotin, Costar, Bautru, etc. But they can\r\nonly be alluded to here. Law also contributed in the person of Patru, a\r\nwriter for the most part on professional topics, but occasionally on\r\nliterature, who is ranked by Boileau with Perrot d'Ablancourt in respect\r\nof style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of literature and the history of philosophy touch each other\r\nonly at certain points of their course. There are periods (the\r\nnineteenth century itself is perhaps an example) when the study of\r\nphilosophy is almost divorced from style. There are others when the two\r\nare intimately wedded. Nowhere is this latter more the case than in the\r\nseventeenth century, and in France. Much of the most excellent writing\r\nof the time was directed to philosophic subjects. But it so happened\r\nthat the great reformer of philosophy in France was also the greatest\r\nreformer of her prose style, and that his greatest disciple carried\r\nphilosophical writing, as far as style is concerned, to very nearly, if\r\nnot quite, the highest pitch which it has yet attained in French. We\r\nshall not have to concern ourselves in more than the very slightest\r\ndegree with the subject of the writings of Descartes and Malebranche,\r\nbut they have as legitimate a place in the history of French literature\r\nas they have in that of European philosophy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Descartes.]\r\n\r\nRene Descartes[272] was born at La Haye in Touraine on the 31st of\r\nMarch, 1596. His family belonged by descent to the province in which he\r\nwas born, but by occupation and official position (as well it would seem\r\nas by possessions) to Britanny. It was of noble rank, though only of\r\n_noblesse de robe_, and possessed enough landed property to leave\r\nestates and territorial designations to two sons. Thus Rene was Seigneur\r\ndu Perron, though, quite contrary to the wont of the day, he never made\r\nuse of the title. He was of weak health both at this time and\r\nafterwards, and, unlike most of his contemporaries, did not begin his\r\nstudies very early. In 1604 he was sent to the Jesuit College of La\r\nFleche, and remained there nearly eight years. After a short stay at\r\nhome he was sent to Paris, where he divided his time between ordinary\r\npursuits and amusements on the one hand, and hard study on the other. In\r\n1617, when he had just attained his majority, he joined the army as a\r\nvolunteer, and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War soon gave him\r\nplenty of employment. He visited various parts of Europe, partly on\r\nduty, partly as an ordinary traveller. First he served for two years at\r\nBreda under Prince Maurice of Nassau, pursuing the same mixture of study\r\nand routine employments. Then he went to Germany, where in his winter\r\nquarters his great philosophical idea, as he has told in memorable\r\nwords, flashed across him. He served in various parts of the empire, and\r\nin Hungary and Bohemia, but left the army in 1621 and went to Holland,\r\nexperiencing on the way a curious and dangerous adventure. After a year\r\nat the Hague he went home, and was put in possession of his share of his\r\nmother's property. He visited Italy, where he made a pilgrimage to\r\nLoretto, then returned to France, and dwelt in Paris for some time;\r\nresuming however his military character for a while, and serving at the\r\nsiege of La Rochelle. At last, in 1628, being then thirty-two years old,\r\nhe left the service finally, and gave himself up wholly to the study of\r\nphilosophy. For this purpose he retired to Holland, where he was still\r\nsomewhat restless[273]. But his chief centres were successively\r\nAmsterdam, Egmond, not far from Alkmaar, and Endegeest, within easy\r\ndistance of the Hague. He returned to France more than once, and was\r\nasked to settle at court, receiving from Mazarin a pension of 3000\r\nlivres. But the troubles of the Fronde made Paris a distasteful and\r\nunsuitable residence for him. He then accepted, at the end of 1649, an\r\ninvitation from Queen Christina of Sweden and went to Stockholm, where\r\nthe severe weather and the gracious habit which the queen had of\r\nsummoning him for discussion at five o'clock in the morning (he had all\r\nhis life when not on active service made a point of not rising till\r\neleven), put an end to his life, by inflammation of the lungs, on Feb.\r\n11, 1650.\r\n\r\nThe works of Descartes are numerous, though few of them are of very\r\ngreat extent. He wrote a treatise (not now extant) on the art of fencing\r\nwhen he was but sixteen; and during the succeeding years small treatises\r\non different points, chiefly of mathematics and natural theology,\r\nconstantly issued from his pen, though he was not a ready writer. The\r\nworks which alone concern us here are his famous _Discours de la\r\nMethode_, 1637, and his letters. The _Meditations_, of equal importance\r\nphilosophically with the _Discours_, and the _Principia Philosophiae_, a\r\nrehandling of the two, were originally published in Latin. No attempt\r\ncan here be made to give any account of Descartes' mathematical,\r\nphysical, and metaphysical speculations, or of the means by which he\r\nendeavoured to work out his great principle, that all knowledge springs\r\nfrom certain ideas clearly and distinctly conceived, and is deducible\r\nmathematically, or rather logically, from these principles.\r\n\r\nUntil and including Victor Cousin, who, though his own style has some\r\ndrawbacks, was a keen judge and a fervent admirer of the best classical\r\nFrench, French writers have always regarded the style of Descartes as\r\none of the most remarkable, and above all the most original in the\r\nlanguage. There cannot be the slightest doubt in the mind of any one\r\nhistorically acquainted with that language, and accustomed to judge\r\nstyle critically, that the opinion is a thoroughly sound one. Of late,\r\nhowever, there have been dissidents, and their opinion has been\r\nstrangely adopted by the latest English biographer of Descartes[274].\r\nControversy as a rule is out of place in these pages, but on this\r\nparticular point, involving as it does one of the most important\r\nquestions in French literary history--the proper distribution of the\r\nepochs of style--an exception must be made. According to Mr. Mahaffy's\r\nview it is Descartes' few letters to Balzac which have gained him a\r\nreputation for style, but he is 'seldom more than clear and correct;' he\r\nis 'seldom grand, not often amusing.' The temptation to enlarge on this\r\nsingular definition of style as that which is grand or amusing must be\r\nresisted. Those who have followed the foregoing pages will perceive\r\nthat the refusal to recognise in a writer who is 'seldom more than clear\r\nand correct' (Descartes is a great deal more than this, but no matter)\r\nthe characteristics of a master of style arises from ignorance of what\r\nthe characteristics and drawbacks of French style had hitherto been.\r\n\r\nProse style may be divided, as conveniently as in any other way, into\r\nthe style of description or narration, and the style of discussion or\r\nargument. The former deals with the imagination, with the passions, with\r\noutward events, with conversation; the latter with the reason only. The\r\nformer propounds images, the latter ideas. The former constructs a\r\npicture, the latter reduces words to their simplest terms as symbols of\r\nthought. French had been making very rapid progress in the former\r\ndivision of style, though there was much left to be done; in the latter\r\nit was yet entirely at its rudiments. Before Descartes there are three\r\nmasters of this latter style, and three only, Rabelais, Calvin, and\r\nMontaigne. There is little doubt that Rabelais might have anticipated\r\nDescartes, had it not been for the fact, first, that, except on rare\r\noccasions, he chose to wrap himself in the grotesque; and, secondly,\r\nthat he came before the innovations of the Pleiade had enriched the\r\nlanguage, and the reaction against the Pleiade had pruned off the\r\nsuperfluity of richness. Calvin was also exposed to this second\r\ndrawback, and had besides a defect of idiosyncrasy in a certain dryness\r\nand heaviness allied with, and partly resulting from, a too close\r\nadherence to Latin forms. Montaigne again, like Rabelais, deliberately\r\nrefuses to be bound by the mere requirements of argument, and expatiates\r\ninto all sorts of digressions, partaking of the other style, the style\r\nof description. If any one will take the famous passage of Descartes\r\nalready referred to (the passage in which he describes how being in\r\nwinter quarters, with nothing to do and sitting all day long by a warm\r\nstove, he started the train of thought which ended or began in _Cogito\r\nergo sum_), and, having a good acquaintance with the three authors just\r\nmentioned, will imagine how the same facts and arguments would have\r\nappeared in their language, he will not find it difficult to realise the\r\ndifference. The grotesque by-play and the archaic vocabulary of\r\n_Gargantua_, the garrulous digression and anecdote of the _Essays_, are\r\nnot more strikingly absent than the jejune scholasticism which is the\r\nworse side of Calvin's grave and noble style. The author does not think\r\nit necessary to attract his readers with ornament, nor to repel them\r\nwith dry and barren marshalling of technicalities. All is simple,\r\nstraightforward, admirably clear, but at the same time the prose is\r\nfluent, modulated, harmonious, and possesses, if not the grace of\r\nsuperadded ornament, those of perfect proportion and unerring choice of\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nAs a prose writer Descartes is generally compared to his contemporary,\r\nand in some sort predecessor, Balzac, and his advantage over the author\r\nof the _Socrate Chretien_ is stated to lie chiefly in the superiority of\r\nhis matter. This is not quite the fact. Balzac had, indeed, aimed at the\r\nsimplicity and classical perfection of Descartes, but he had not\r\nattained it; he still has much of the quaintness of Montaigne, though it\r\nmust be remembered that in comparisons of this kind censure bestowed on\r\nthe authors compared is relative not positive, and that Descartes could\r\nno more have written the _Essays_ than Montaigne the _Discours_.\r\nDescartes has almost entirely discarded this quaintness, which sometimes\r\npassed into what is called in French _clinquant_, that is to say, tawdry\r\nand grotesque ornament. It is a peculiarity of his that no single\r\ndescription of his sentences fully describes their form. They are always\r\nperfectly clear, but they are sometimes very long. Their length,\r\nhowever, as is the case with some English authors of the same century,\r\nis more apparent than real, the writer having chosen to link by\r\nconjunctions clauses which are independently finished, and which, by\r\ndifferent punctuation even without the omission of the conjunction,\r\nmight stand alone. The mistake of saying that Descartes is nothing more\r\nthan clear and correct can only arise from an imperfect appreciation of\r\nthe language. Let, for instance, his condemnation of scholastic method\r\nin the _Discours_ be taken. Here the matter is interesting enough, and\r\nthe comparison with the gorgeous but unphilosophical disdain which Bacon\r\nis wont to pour on the studies of the past is interesting also. But we\r\nare busied with the form. In the first place, any one must be struck\r\nwith the modernness of the phrase and style. With insignificant\r\nexceptions there is nothing which would not be most excellent French\r\nto-day. Further examination of the phrase will show that there is much\r\nmore in it than mere clearness and correctness, admirably clear and\r\ncorrect as it is. There is no 'spilth of adjectives,' as it has been\r\ntermed. The words are just so many as are necessary for clear, correct,\r\nand elegant expression of the thought. But it is in the selection of\r\nthem that the master of style appears. The happy phrase, 'La gentillesse\r\ndes fables reveille l'esprit;' the comparison of the reading of the best\r\nauthors not merely to a conversation, but a _conversation etudiee_, in\r\nwhich the speakers 'show only their best thoughts;' the contrast between\r\neloquence and poetry (too often forgotten by the writer's countrymen);\r\nthe ironic touch[275] in the eulogium on philosophy; all these things\r\nshow style in its very rarest and highest form--the form which enables\r\nthe writer to say the most, and to say it most forcibly with the least\r\nexpenditure of the stores of the dictionary. One sees at once that the\r\nrequirement of one of the greatest French writers of our time, that the\r\nmaster of style 'shall be able to express at once any idea that presents\r\nitself requiring expression,' is fully, and more than fully, met by\r\nDescartes; and one sees also how the miracles of expression which\r\nPascal, La Rochefoucauld, Bossuet, were to produce became possible, and\r\nwho showed them the way. It may be asserted, without the slightest fear,\r\nthat the more thoroughly Descartes is studied with the necessary\r\napparatus of knowledge, the more firmly will his claims in this\r\ndirection be established.\r\n\r\nIt is not superfluous to call attention to the fact that the _Discours\r\nde la Methode_ appeared within a few months of the _Cid_. Thus it\r\nhappened that the first complete models of French classical style in\r\nprose and verse, and two of the most remarkable examples of that style\r\nwhich have ever been produced, were given to the public as nearly as\r\npossible contemporaneously. This fact, and the brilliant group of\r\nimitators who almost immediately availed themselves of the examples,\r\nprove satisfactorily how powerful were the influences which produced the\r\nchange, and over how wide a circle they worked. As the influence of\r\nDescartes was thus no less literary than philosophical, it followed\r\nnaturally enough that his school (which soon included almost all the men\r\nof intellectual eminence in France) preserved literary as well as\r\nphilosophical traditions. This school, so far as it concerns French\r\nliterature, may be said to have produced two remarkable individuals and\r\none remarkable group. The group was the school of Port Royal; the\r\nindividuals were Malebranche and Bayle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Port Royal.]\r\n\r\nWe are not here concerned with the religious fortunes of the community\r\nof Port Royal[276]. It is sufficient to say that it was originally a\r\nnunnery at no great distance from Versailles, that it underwent a great\r\nreligious revival under the influence of St. Francis de Sales and Mere\r\nAngelique Arnauld, and that, chiefly owing to the inspiration of the\r\nAbbe de St. Cyran, there was engrafted on it a community of _Solitaires_\r\nof the other sex, who busied themselves in study, in religious\r\nexercises, in manual labour, and in the education of youth. The society\r\nwas early imbued with Jansenist principles, which brought it into\r\nviolent conflict with the Jesuits, and eventually led to its persecution\r\nand destruction. It was also the head-quarters of a somewhat modified\r\nCartesianism, and this, with its importance as a centre of literary\r\ninstruction and its intimate connection with many famous men of letters,\r\nsuch as Pascal, Nicole, and Racine, gives it a place in the history of\r\nliterature. The most remarkable work of an educational kind which\r\nproceeded from it was the famous Port Royal Logic, or 'Art of Thinking,'\r\nwhich seems to have been a work of collaboration, Arnauld and Nicole\r\nbeing the chief authors. This, though open to criticism from the point\r\nof view of the logician, had a very great influence in making the\r\nmethodical treatment and clear luminous exposition which were\r\ncharacteristic of the Cartesian school common in French writers. Of the\r\ntwo authors just mentioned, Arnauld was the greater thinker, Nicole by\r\nfar the better writer. He was, in fact, a sort of minor Pascal, his\r\n_Lettres sur les Visionnaires_ corresponding to the _Provinciales_ of\r\nhis greater contemporary, while he was the author of _Pensees_, which,\r\nunlike Pascal's, were regularly finished, and which, though much\r\ninferior to them, have something of the same character. The\r\nintellectual activity of Port Royal was very considerable, but most of\r\nit was directed into channels which were not purely literary, owing\r\npartly to incessant controversies brought on by the differences between\r\nthe community and the Jesuits, partly to the cultivation of\r\nphilosophical subjects. The age was perhaps the most controversial that\r\nEurope has ever seen, and the comparative absence of periodicals (which\r\nwere only in their infancy) threw the controversies necessarily into\r\nbook form, as letters, pamphlets, or even volumes of considerable size.\r\nBut no very large portion of this controversial matter deserves the name\r\nof literature, and much of it was written in Latin. Thus Gassendi, the\r\nupholder of Neo-Epicurean opinions in opposition to Descartes, and\r\nbeyond all question the greatest French philosopher of the century after\r\nDescartes and Malebranche, hardly belongs to French literature, though\r\nhis Latin works are of great bulk and no small literary merit. The\r\nGassendian school soon gave birth to a small but influential school of\r\nmaterialist freethinkers. What may be called the school of orthodox\r\ndoubt, which had been represented by Montaigne and Charron, had, as has\r\nbeen said, a representative in La Mothe le Vayer. But this special kind\r\nof scepticism was already antiquated, if not obsolete, and it was\r\nsucceeded, on the one side, by the above-mentioned freethinkers, who\r\nwere also to a great extent free livers[277], and whose most remarkable\r\nliterary figure was Saint Evremond; on the other, by a school of learned\r\nPyrrhonists, whose most remarkable representative in every respect was\r\nPierre Bayle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bayle.]\r\n\r\nBayle was born in the south of France in 1647, and, like almost all the\r\nmen of letters of his time, was educated by the Jesuits. He was of a\r\nProtestant family, and was converted by his teachers, his conversion\r\nbeing however so little of a solid one that he reverted to\r\nProtestantism in less than two years. After this he resided for some\r\ntime in Switzerland, studying Cartesianism. In 1675 he was made\r\nProfessor of Philosophy at Sedan, a post which he held for six years,\r\nmoving thence to Rotterdam. Here he began to write numerous articles and\r\nworks in the periodicals, which were slowly becoming fashionable,\r\nespecially in Holland. They were mostly critical, and dealt with\r\nscientific, historical, philosophical, and theological subjects. Bayle's\r\nutterances on the latter subject, and especially his pleas for\r\ntoleration, brought him into a troublesome controversy with Jurieu, and\r\nin 1693 he was deprived of his professorship, or at least of his right\r\nto lecture. He then devoted himself to the famous Dictionary which is\r\nidentified with his name, and which, though by no means the first\r\nencyclopaedia of modern times (for Alsten, Moreri, Hoffmann, and others\r\nhad preceded him within the century), was by far the most influential\r\nand most original yet produced. It appeared in 1696, and brought him new\r\ntroubles, which were not however of a serious character. He died in\r\n1706.\r\n\r\nThe scepticism of which Bayle was the exponent was purely critical and\r\nintellectual. He was not in the least an enemy of the moral system of\r\nChristianity, nor even, it would appear, an enemy to Christianity\r\nitself. But his intellect was constitutionally disposed to see the\r\nobjections to all things rather than the arguments in their favour, and\r\nto take a pleasure in stating these objections. Thus, though he was\r\nafter his religious oscillations nominally an orthodox Protestant, the\r\ntendency of his works was to impugn points held by Protestants and\r\nCatholics alike, and though he was nominally a Cartesian, he was equally\r\nfar from yielding an implicit belief to the doctrines of Descartes. His\r\nmost famous work is the reverse of methodical. The subjects are chosen\r\nalmost at random, and are very frequently nothing but pegs on which to\r\nhang notes and digressions in which the author indulges his critical and\r\ndissolvent faculty. Nor is the style by any means a model. But it is\r\nlively, clear, and interesting, and no doubt had a good deal to do with\r\nthe vast popularity of his book in the eighteenth century. Bayle had a\r\nstrong influence on Voltaire, and though he had less to do with his\r\nfollower's style than Saint Evremond and Pascal, he is nearer to him in\r\nspirit than either. The difference perhaps may be said to be that\r\nBayle's pleasure in negative criticism is almost purely intellectual.\r\nThere is but little in him of the half-childish mischievousness which\r\ndistinguishes Voltaire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Malebranche.]\r\n\r\nCartesianism was not less likely than its opposites to lead to\r\nphilosophical scepticism, but in the main its professors, taking their\r\nmaster's conduct for model, remained orthodox. In that case, however,\r\nthe Cartesian idealism had a tendency to pass into mysticism. Of those\r\nin whom it took this form Nicolas Malebranche[278] was the unquestioned\r\nchief. He was born at Paris, where his father held a lucrative office;\r\nin 1638, and from his birth had very feeble health. When he was of age\r\nhe became an Oratorian, and passed the whole of his long life in study\r\nand literary work, sometimes being engaged in controversies on the\r\ncompatibility of his system--the famous 'Vision in God,' and 'Spiritual\r\nExistence in God'--with orthodoxy, but never receiving any formal\r\ncensure from the Church. Despite his bad health he lived to the age of\r\nseventy-seven, dying in 1715. A curious story is told of a verbal\r\nargument between him and Berkeley on the eve of his death. He wrote\r\nseveral works in French, such as a _Traite de Morale_, _Conversations\r\nMetaphysiques_, etc., but his greatest and most remarkable contribution\r\nto French literature is his _Recherche de la Verite_, published in 1674,\r\nwhich unfolds his system. From the literary point of view the\r\n_Recherche_ is one of the most considerable books of the philosophical\r\nclass ever produced. Unlike the various works of Descartes it is of very\r\ngreat length, filling three volumes in the original edition, and a\r\nthousand pages of close type in the most handy modern reprint. It also\r\ndeals with subjects of an exceedingly abstract character, and is not\r\ndiversified by any elaborate illustrations, any machinery like that of\r\nPlato or Berkeley, or any passages of set eloquence. The purity and\r\nbeauty of the style, however, and its extraordinary lucidity, make it a\r\nbook of which it is difficult to tire. The chief mechanical difference\r\nbetween the style of Malebranche and that of his master is that his\r\nsentences are shorter. They are, however, framed with equal care as to\r\nrhythm and to logical arrangement. The metaphor of limpidity is very\r\nfrequently applied to style, but perhaps there is hardly any to which it\r\nmay be applied with such propriety as to the style of Malebranche.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[272] Not fully edited yet. Cousin's edition is the fullest, but the\r\nimportant French works figure in many popular collections and are easily\r\naccessible.\r\n\r\n[273] He was 'as restless as a hyaena,' says De Quincey, not unjustly.\r\n\r\n[274] Professor Mahaffy, _Descartes_.

In the\r\npersons of Theophile and Saint Evremond they touch on literature: but\r\nfor the most part they were chiefly distinguished by revolting\r\ncoarseness and blasphemy of expression, and by a childish delight in\r\noutraging religious sentiment, which was often changed into abject\r\nterror or hypocritical compliance as death approached. They were\r\ncommonly called _philosophes_, a degradation of the word which was not\r\nmuch mended in the next century, though it then acquired a more strictly\r\nliterary meaning.\r\n\r\n[278] Ed. Simon. 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHEOLOGIANS AND PREACHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no period in the whole course of French literature in which\r\ntheological writers and orators contribute so much to literary history\r\nas in the seventeenth century. The causes of this energy can only be\r\nsummarily indicated here. They were the various _sequelae_ of the\r\nReformation and the counter-reformation, the latter of which was in\r\nFrance extraordinarily powerful; the influence of Richelieu and Mazarin\r\nin politics, which assured to the Church a great predominance in the\r\nState, while its rival, the territorial aristocracy, was depressed and\r\npersecuted; the personal inclination of Louis XIV., who made up for his\r\nloose manner of life by the straitest doctrinal orthodoxy; but perhaps\r\nmost of all the accidental determination of various men of great talents\r\nand energy to the ecclesiastical profession. Bossuet, Fenelon,\r\nBourdaloue, Massillon, Flechier, Mascaron, Claude, Saurin, to name no\r\nothers, could hardly have failed to distinguish themselves in any\r\ndepartment of literature which they had chosen. Circumstances of\r\naccident threw them into work more or less wholly theological.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: St. Francois de Sales.]\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity of the century, however, belongs chiefly to its third\r\nand fourth quarters. The first preacher and theologian of literary\r\neminence in this period belongs about equally to it and to the\r\npreceding, but his most remarkable work dates from this time. Francois\r\nde Sales was born at Annecy in 1567. He was destined for the law, and\r\ncompleted his education for it at Paris, but his vocation for the church\r\nwas stronger, and he took orders in 1593. He soon distinguished himself\r\nby reconverting a considerable number of persons to the Roman form of\r\nfaith in the district of Chablais, and at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century preached at Paris, and latterly at Dijon. He was\r\nsoon made bishop of Geneva, an episcopate which, it need hardly be said,\r\nmight almost be described as _in partibus infidelium_. But in the south\r\nof France, in Savoy, and in Paris itself, his influence was great. His\r\nchief works are the 'Introduction to a Devout Life' (1608), the _Traite\r\nde l'Amour de Dieu_, 'Spiritual Letters' (to Madame de Chantal), and\r\nsermons. His style is by no means destitute of archaism, but it is\r\nclear, fluent, and agreeable. He and Fenouillet, bishop of Marseilles,\r\nwith other preachers whose names are now forgotten, were the chief\r\ninstruments in recovering the art of sacred oratory from the low estate\r\ninto which it had fallen during the heat of the religious wars and the\r\nLeague, when it had been disgraced alternately by violence and\r\nbuffoonery. But the Thirty Years' War and the Fronde were again\r\nunfavourable to theological discussion, except of a quasi-political\r\nkind, and the best spirits of this time threw themselves into the\r\nunpopular direction of Jansenism. The 'Siecle de Louis Quatorze' proper,\r\nthat is the period subsequent to 1660, was the palmy time, from the\r\nliterary point of view, of theological eloquence and discussion in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bossuet.]\r\n\r\nOf the authors already named Bossuet deserves precedence in almost every\r\nrespect except that of private character. Jacques Benigne Bossuet[279]\r\nwas born at Dijon, in 1627, of a family of distinction in the middle\r\nclass. He went to school to the Jesuits in his native town, and finished\r\nhis education at the College de Navarre in Paris, receiving his doctor's\r\ndegree and a canonry at Metz in 1652. He soon distinguished himself both\r\nas an orator and a controversialist, preached before the king in Advent\r\n1661, and in 1669 was appointed to the bishopric of Condom. His\r\nsubsequent appointment to the post of tutor to the Dauphin made him\r\nresign his bishopric; but on the completion of his task (in virtue of\r\nwhich he had been elected to the Academy in 1680) he was made almoner to\r\nthe prince, and in the following year received the bishopric of Meaux.\r\nHe was soon after engaged in the Gallican controversy, in which he\r\ndefended not so much the rights of the Church as the claims of the royal\r\nprerogative. The most unfortunate incident of his life was his\r\ncontroversy with Fenelon. Bossuet, though thoroughly learned in some\r\nrespects, was not a man of the widest culture, and the whole region of\r\nmystical theology was unknown to him. He, therefore, mistook certain\r\nutterances of the archbishop of Cambray, which were neither new nor\r\nalarming, for heterodox innovations, and began a violent polemic against\r\nhim. Supported by the king, he was able to obtain a nominal victory, but\r\nthe moral success rested with Fenelon, and still more the advantage in\r\nthe literary duel. Bossuet died in 1704. His works were very numerous,\r\nand of very various kinds. His first reputation was, as has been said,\r\nearned as a controversialist (his principal adversaries in this respect\r\nwere the Protestant ministers Ferri and Claude) and as a preacher on\r\ngeneral subjects. On his appointment to the see of Condom, however, he\r\nstruck out a new line, that of funeral discourses (_oraisons funebres_),\r\nand produced, on the occasions of the death of the two Henriettas of\r\nEngland, mother and daughter, of the great Conde, of the\r\nPrincess-Palatine, and of others, works which are undoubtedly triumphs\r\nof French eloquence, and which, with the exception of the best passages\r\nof Burke, are perhaps the only things of the kind comparable to the\r\nmasterpieces of antiquity. His controversial work is equal in perfection\r\nof execution to his oratory, the _Exposition de la Doctrine de l'Eglise\r\nCatholique_, and still more the _Histoire des Variations des Eglises\r\nProtestantes_, being deservedly regarded as models of their kind,\r\nnotwithstanding the obvious fallacy pervading the latter. Of his other\r\nworks the most remarkable (perhaps the most remarkable of all if\r\noriginality of conception and breadth of design be taken into account)\r\nis his _Discours sur l'Histoire Universelle jusqu'a l'Empire de\r\nCharlemagne_. This has, though not universally, been held to be the\r\nfirst attempt at the philosophy of history, that is to say, the first\r\nwork in which general history is regarded and expounded from a single\r\ncomprehensive point of view, and laws of a universal kind drawn from it.\r\nIn Bossuet's case the point of view is, of course, strictly theological,\r\nand the laws are arranged accordingly.\r\n\r\nBossuet's character was unamiable, and, despite the affected frankness\r\nwith which he spoke to the king, it will always remain a blot on his\r\nmemory that he did not seriously protest either against the loose life\r\nof Louis, or against his ruinous ambition and lawless disregard of the\r\nrights of nations. There is, however, no doubt whatever of his perfect\r\nsincerity and of the genuineness of his belief in political autocracy,\r\nprovided that the autocrat was a faithful son of the Church. He was a\r\nCartesian, and was probably not unindebted to Descartes for the force\r\nand vigour of his reasonings, though he was hardly so careful as his\r\nmaster in enlarging the field of his knowledge and assuring the validity\r\nof his premises. The extraordinary majesty of his rhetoric, perhaps,\r\nbrings out by force of contrast the occasionally fallacious character of\r\nhis reasoning, but it must be confessed that even as a controversialist\r\nhe has few equals. The rhetorical excellence of the _Oraisons_ and the\r\ngorgeous sweep, not merely of the language but of the conception, in the\r\n_Histoire Universelle_, show him at what is really his best; while many\r\nisolated expressions betray at once an intimate knowledge of the human\r\nheart, and a hardly surpassed faculty of clothing that knowledge in\r\nwords. Bossuet no doubt is more of a speaker than a writer. His\r\nexcellence lies in the wonderful survey, and grasp of the subject\r\n(qualities which make his favourite literary nickname of the 'Eagle of\r\nMeaux' more than usually appropriate), in the contagious enthusiasm and\r\nenergy with which he attacks his point, in his inexhaustible metaphors\r\nand comparisons. He has not the unfailing charm of Malebranche, nor that\r\nwhich belongs in a less degree, and with more mannerism, to Fenelon; he\r\nis very unequal, and small blemishes of style abound in him. Thus, in\r\nhis most famous passage, the description of the sudden death of\r\nHenrietta of Orleans, occurs the phrase 'comme un coup de _tonnerre_\r\ncette _etonnante_ nouvelle,' a jingle of words as unpleasant as it is\r\neasily avoided. But blemishes of this kind (and it is, perhaps,\r\nnoteworthy that French is more tolerant of them than almost any other\r\nlanguage of equal literary perfection) disappear in the volume and force\r\nof the torrent of Bossuet's eloquence. It is fair to add that, though he\r\nis almost always aiming at the sublime, he scarcely ever oversteps it,\r\nor falls into the bombastic and the ridiculous. Even his elaborate\r\neulogy (it would hardly be fair to call it flattery) of the great is so\r\ncunningly balanced by exposition of the nothingness of men and things,\r\nthat it does not strike the mind's eye with any immediate sense of\r\nglaring impropriety. The lack of formal perfection which is sometimes\r\nnoticeable in him is made up to a greater degree almost than in any\r\nother writer by the intense force and conviction of the speaker and the\r\nimposing majesty of his manner. It is pretty certain that most attempts\r\nto imitate Bossuet would result in a lamentable failure; and it is not a\r\nlittle significant that the only two Frenchmen who in prose have shown\r\nthemselves occasionally his rivals, Michelet and Lamennais, are among\r\nthe most unequal of writers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fenelon.]\r\n\r\nThe contrast between Bossuet and his chief rival was in all respects\r\ngreat. To begin with, Fenelon was a much younger man than Bossuet,\r\nbelonging it might be said almost to another generation. He inherited\r\nsome of the noblest blood in France, while Bossuet was but a _roturier_,\r\nand this may have had something to do with the more independent\r\ncharacter of Fenelon. Bossuet was a vigorous student of certain defined\r\nbranches of knowledge, but of general literature he took little heed.\r\nFenelon was a man of almost universal reading, and one of the most\r\noriginal and soundest literary critics of his time. Fenelon felt deeply\r\nfor the misery of the French people; Bossuet does not appear to have\r\ntroubled himself about it. Finally Bossuet, with all his merits, had\r\ngrave faults of moral character, while to Fenelon--quite as justly as to\r\nBerkeley--every virtue under heaven may be assigned. Francois de\r\nSalignac de la Mothe-Fenelon[280] was born at the castle of the same\r\nname in the province of Perigord, on August 16th, 1661. He was educated\r\nfirst at home, then at Cahors, and then at the College de Plessis at\r\nParis. He finally studied in a theological seminary for some years, and\r\ndid not formally enter the Church till he was four-and-twenty. He then\r\ndevoted himself partly to the poor, partly to education, especially of\r\ngirls, and his treatise on this latter subject was his first work. In\r\n1687 he was appointed preceptor to the Duke de Bourgogne, son of\r\nBossuet's pupil, and heir to the throne. For the duke he wrote a great\r\nnumber of books, among them _Telemaque_ (or at least the first sketch of\r\nit). In 1697 he was appointed archbishop of Cambray. Into his connection\r\nwith Madame Guyon, the celebrated apostle of quietism, and his\r\nconsequent quarrel with Bossuet, there is no need to enter further.\r\nWhichever of the two may have been theologically in the right, there are\r\nno two opinions on the question that Bossuet was in the wrong, both in\r\nthe acrimony of his conduct and the violence of his language. In the\r\nlatter respect, indeed, he brought down upon himself a well-deserved\r\npunishment. Fenelon was the mildest of men, but he possessed a faculty\r\nof quiet irony inferior to that of no man then living, and he used it\r\nwith effect in the controversy against Bossuet's declamatory\r\ndenunciations. When, at last, the matter had been referred to the Pope,\r\nand judgment had been given against himself, Fenelon at once bowed to\r\nthe decision and acknowledged his error. Louis, however, had many more\r\nreasons for disliking him than the mere odium theologicum with which\r\nBossuet had inspired him. Fenelon was known to disapprove of much in the\r\nactual government of France, and the surreptitious publication of\r\n_Telemaque_ completed his disgrace. He was banished from court and\r\nconfined to his diocese, in which he accordingly spent the last part of\r\nhis life, doing his best to alleviate the misery caused on the borders\r\nby the war of the Spanish succession, and dying at Cambray in 1715.\r\n\r\nFenelon was an industrious writer. Few of his finished sermons have been\r\npreserved; but these are excellent, as are also his fables written for\r\nthe Duke de Bourgogne, his already-mentioned _Education des Filles_, and\r\nhis _Dialogues des Morts_, also written for the Duke, in which the form\r\nis borrowed from Lucian, but in which moral lessons are substituted for\r\nmere satire. Like Bossuet, Fenelon was a Cartesian, and his _Traite de\r\nl'Existence de Dieu_ is a philosophico-religious work of no small merit.\r\nIn literary history he is remarkable for having directly opposed the\r\nvictorious work of Boileau. He has left several exercises in literary\r\ncriticism, such as his _Lettre sur les Occupations de l'Academie\r\nFrancaise_, one of the latest of his works; his _Dialogues sur\r\nl'Eloquence_, and a contribution to the famous dispute of ancients and\r\nmoderns in correspondence with La Motte. He regretted the impoverishment\r\nof the language, and the loss of much of the energy and picturesque\r\nvigour of the sixteenth century. In his controversy with Bossuet, though\r\nthe matter is not strictly literary, there is, as has been noticed, much\r\nadmirable literary work; but his chief claim to a place in literary\r\nhistory is, of course, _Telemaque_, which work he had anticipated by the\r\nsomewhat similar _Aventures d'Aristonous_. It has often been regretted\r\nthat classics in any language should be used for purposes of instruction\r\nin the rudiments, and hardly any single work has suffered more from this\r\npractice than _Telemaque_, for learners of French are usually set to\r\nread it long before they have any power of literary appreciation. A\r\ncontinuous narrative, moreover, is about the least suited of all\r\nliterary forms to bear that process of cutting up in short pieces which\r\nis necessary in education. The pleasure of the story is either lost\r\naltogether, or anticipated by surreptitious reading on the part of the\r\npupil, after which the mechanical plodding through matter of which he\r\nhas already exhausted the interest is disgusting enough. Yet it can\r\nhardly be doubted that if _Telemaque_ had not, in the case of most\r\nreaders, this fatal disadvantage, its beauties would be generally\r\nacknowledged. Its form is somewhat artificial, and the author has,\r\nperhaps, not escaped the error of most moral fiction writers, that of\r\nmaking his hero too much of a model of what ought to be, and too little\r\nof a copy of what is. But the story is excellently managed, the various\r\nincidents are drawn with remarkable vividness and picturesqueness, the\r\ndescriptions are uniformly excellent, and the style is almost\r\nimpeccable. Even were the moral sentiments and the general tendency of\r\nthe book less excellent than they are, its value as a model of French\r\ncomposition would probably have secured it something like its present\r\nplace side by side with La Fontaine's Fables as a school-book. It is\r\nfair to add that in the character of Calypso, where the need of the\r\nauthor for a 'terrible example' freed him from his restraints, very\r\nconsiderable powers of character-drawing are shown, and the same may be\r\nsaid of not a few of the minor personages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massillon.]\r\n\r\nThe third greatest name of the period in this class of men of letters\r\nis beyond all question that of Massillon. He, like Fenelon, belongs to\r\nthe second, if not the third, generation of the Siecle de Louis\r\nQuatorze, being nearly forty years younger than Bossuet. He was a long\r\nliver, and his death did not occur till far into the reign of Louis XV.,\r\nwhen the reputation of Voltaire was established, and the\r\neighteenth-century movement was in full swing. But his literary and\r\noratorical activity had ceased for nearly a quarter of a century at the\r\ntime of his death. Jean Baptiste Massillon[281] was a native of Hieres,\r\nand was born on June 24, 1663. His father was a notary, and he himself\r\nwas destined for the same profession; but his vocation for the Church\r\nwas strong, and he was at last permitted to enter the Oratorian\r\nCongregation. His aptitude for preaching was soon discovered, and when\r\nvery young he distinguished himself by _Oraisons Funebres_ on the\r\narchbishops of Lyons and Vienne. He was of a retiring disposition, and,\r\nwishing to avoid publicity, joined a stricter order than that of the\r\nOratory, but was induced, and indeed ordered, by the Cardinal de\r\nNoailles, who heard him preach in his new abode, not to hide his light\r\nunder a bushel, but to come to Paris and do the Church service. He\r\nobeyed, and was established in the capital in 1696. His fame soon became\r\ngreat, and he preached before the king more than one course of sermons.\r\nHe was appointed bishop of Clermont in 1717, and in the same year\r\npreached the celebrated _Petit Careme_, or course of Lent sermons,\r\nbefore Louis XV. In 1719 he was elected of the Academy. He preached his\r\nlast sermon at Paris in 1723, and then retired to his diocese, where he\r\nspent the last twenty years of his life, dying of apoplexy at the age of\r\neighty, Sept. 28, 1742.\r\n\r\nMassillon has usually, and justly, been considered the greatest\r\npreacher, in the strict sense of the word, of France. Only Bossuet and\r\nBourdaloue could contest this position; and though both preceded him,\r\nand he owed much to both, he excels both in sermons properly so called.\r\nBossuet was, perhaps, a greater orator, if the finest parts of his work\r\nonly are taken; but he was, as has been said, unequal, and in the two\r\ngreat objects of the preacher, exposition of doctrine and effect upon\r\nthe consciences of his hearers, he was admittedly inferior to Massillon.\r\nThe latter, moreover, has, of all French preachers (for Fenelon, it must\r\nbe remembered, has left but few sermons), the purest style, and\r\npossesses the greatest range. His special function was considered to be\r\npersuasion; yet few pulpit orators have managed the sterner parts of\r\ntheir duty more forcibly. Massillon's sermon on the Prodigal Son, and\r\nthat on the Deaths of the Just and the Unjust, are models of his style.\r\nIt is, moreover, very much to his credit that he was the most\r\nuncompromising, despite his gentleness, of all the great preachers of\r\nthe time, and, therefore, the least popular at court. Louis the\r\nFourteenth's famous epigram, to the effect that other preachers made him\r\ncontented with them, but Massillon made him discontented with himself,\r\nwas somewhat comically illustrated by the fact that, after the second\r\ncourse of sermons preached before him, that of Lent 1704, the preacher,\r\nthough then in the very height of his powers, was never asked again to\r\npreach at court. We are, however, more concerned with the manner than\r\nwith the matter of his orations. He had (after the example of\r\nBourdaloue, it is true) entirely discarded the frippery of erudition\r\nwith which most of his predecessors had been wont to load their sermons,\r\nas well as the occasional oddities of gesticulation and anecdote which\r\nhad once been fashionable. His style is simple, straightforward, and yet\r\nextremely elegant. In the commonplaces of French literary history of the\r\nold school he is called the Racine of the pulpit, a compliment\r\ndetermined by the extreme purity and elegance of his style, but not\r\notherwise very applicable, inasmuch as one chief characteristic of\r\nMassillon is an energy and masculine vigour of expression in which\r\nRacine is, for the most part, wanting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bourdaloue.]\r\n\r\nIf we have postponed Bourdaloue to Massillon, despite the order of\r\nchronology, it has been in accordance with Bourdaloue's own remark when\r\nMassillon made his first reputation, 'He must increase, but I must\r\ndecrease.' This remark is characteristic of the disposition of the man,\r\nwhich was as stainless as Massillon's own. Louis Bourdaloue was born at\r\nBourges on the 20th August, 1632, and was thus not many years the junior\r\nof Bossuet. He entered the Society of Jesus early, and served it as\r\nprofessor of philosophy and kindred subjects. But his superiors soon\r\ndiscovered his talents as a preacher, and he was sent to make his way\r\nbefore the court, where he became a great favourite, especially with\r\nMadame de Sevigne, who was no mean critic. He died in 1704.\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristic of Bourdaloue's eloquence is a remarkable\r\nabsence of ornament, and a strict adherence to dialectical order. None\r\nof the great French preachers admit of logical abstraction and _precis_\r\nso well as he. Another peculiarity is his preference for ethical\r\nsubjects. More than any of his contemporaries he was an expounder of\r\nChristian morality, and his sermons are wont to deal with simple virtues\r\nand vices rather than with points of devotional piety. He was, like\r\nMassillon, and even more than Massillon, absolutely fearless and\r\nuncompromising, preaching against adultery in the very face of Louis\r\nXIV. in his early days, and sparing no vice or folly of the court. But,\r\nperhaps owing to the somewhat severe and exclusively intellectual\r\ncharacter of his oratory, it does not appear to have produced the\r\neffects, salutary doubtless for the hearers, but somewhat inconvenient\r\nfor the preacher, which attended the more cunningly-aimed attacks of\r\nMassillon.\r\n\r\nThe example of the three great preachers--Bossuet, Bourdaloue, and\r\nMassillon--raised up many imitators, some of whom, such as De la Rue,\r\nCheminais, and others, were popular in their day. There are, however,\r\nfour orators--two Roman Catholics, and two belonging to the French\r\nProtestant Church--to whom is usually and rightly accorded the second\r\nrank, while sectarian partiality sometimes claims even the first for\r\nthem. These were Flechier, Mascaron, Claude, and Saurin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Preachers.]\r\n\r\nEsprit Flechier was born at Pesmes in 1632. For a time he was a member\r\nof the congregation of the Brothers of Christian Doctrine, which,\r\nhowever, on an alteration of its constitution by a new superior-general\r\n(he had been introduced to it by his uncle, who held that office), he\r\nquitted. He then went to Paris and tried various methods of gaining a\r\nlivelihood, such as writing verses in Latin and French, and teaching in\r\na school. In these early days he indulged in various forms of\r\nmiscellaneous literature. The most curious and interesting of these\r\nworks is a little account of the _Grands Jours d'Auvergne_, a sort of\r\nprovincial assize which he visited. This has much liveliness, and the\r\nsketches of character and manners show a good deal of skill. But at\r\nlength he found his proper sphere in the pulpit. He acquired reputation\r\nby his _Oraison Funebre_ on Turenne. He became a member of the Academy\r\n(being admitted on the same day as Racine); and he was appointed, first,\r\nto the bishopric of Lavaur, then to that of Nimes, where, in a very\r\ndifficult position (for the revocation of the edict of Nantes had\r\nexasperated the Protestants, who were numerous in the diocese), he made\r\nhimself universally beloved. He died in 1710. The most famous of\r\nFlechier's discourses are those on Madame de Montausier (the heroine of\r\nthe _Guirlande de Julie_[282] and the idol of the Hotel de Rambouillet),\r\nthat on Madame de Montausier's husband, and that on Turenne. Flechier\r\nrepresents a somewhat older style of diction and expression than either\r\nof his great contemporaries, Bossuet and Bourdaloue; and his style,\r\nunlike some other work of this older school, is not characterised by\r\nmany striking occasional phrases, but his sermons as a whole are\r\nvigorous and well expressed.\r\n\r\nJean Mascaron was born at Marseilles in 1634. It is worth noticing that\r\nalmost all these orators came from the south of France. He preached\r\nfrequently before the king, and did not hesitate to rebuke his vices,\r\nnotwithstanding or because of which he was appointed to the bishopric of\r\nTulle, whence he was afterwards translated to Agen. He died in 1703.\r\nMascaron is chiefly remembered for his _Oraison_ on that same death of\r\nTurenne which gave occasion to so many orators. He is usually reproached\r\nwith a certain affectation of style, and there is justice in the\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\nOf the two Protestant divines who have been mentioned Claude was the\r\nless distinguished, though he sustained on pretty even terms a public\r\ncontroversy with Bossuet himself. Jacques Saurin was of less political\r\ninfluence with his own sect, but he possessed greater eloquence, and\r\ncritics of his own persuasion in France and Switzerland have equalled\r\nhim to Bossuet. His works, moreover, long continued to be the most\r\npopular body of household divinity with French Protestants. He was born\r\nat Nimes, 1677, and was thus considerably younger even than Massillon.\r\nThe revocation of the edict of Nantes (which had formed the subject of\r\nsome of Claude's most famous discourses) prevented him from making a\r\nname for himself in France. He was at first appointed, in 1701, after\r\nstudying at Geneva, to a Walloon congregation in London, but soon moved,\r\nin consequence of weak health, to the Hague. He there became a victim of\r\nthe petty dissensions which seem to have been more frequent among Dutch\r\nProtestant sects than anywhere else, and to the vexation of these is\r\nsaid to have been partly due his comparatively early death in 1730. He\r\nleft a very considerable number of sermons and some theological\r\ntreatises. He was admittedly a great orator, excelling in striking\r\npictures and forcible imagery.\r\n\r\nIt will have been observed that, though this age contributes more to\r\ntheology of the literary kind than almost any other, its most memorable\r\ncontributions are almost exclusively oratorical. Incidentally, however,\r\nmuch that was intended to be read, not heard, was of course written. But\r\nless of it has been thought worthy the attention of posterity. The chief\r\ntheological names in this department have already been named in naming\r\nthose of the other. Of the school of Port Royal, who preached little but\r\nwrote much, J. J. Duguet, a man of great talent and saintly life,\r\ndeserves mention.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[279] Bossuet's works are extremely voluminous. The most important of\r\nthem are easily obtainable in the _Collection Didot_ and similar\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\n[280] There is a fairly representative edition of Fenelon in five vols.\r\nlarge 8vo. Didot. Separate works are easily accessible.\r\n\r\n[281] Edition as in Fenelon's case. Selections of all the orthodox\r\nsermon-writers are abundant.\r\n\r\n[282] This was an album to which the poets of the day, from Corneille\r\ndownwards, contributed verses, each on a different flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tendencies of the period which has been surveyed in the foregoing\r\nbook must be sufficiently obvious from the survey itself. They had been,\r\nas far as the unsatisfactory result of them went, indicated with\r\nremarkably prophetic precision by Regnier in lines quoted above[283].\r\nThe work, not merely of Malherbe, which the satirist had directly in\r\nview, but of Boileau, who succeeded Malherbe and completed his task, had\r\ntended far too much in the direction of substituting a formal regularity\r\nfor an elastic freedom and of discouraging the more poetical utterances\r\nof thought. In prose, however, the operation of not dissimilar\r\ntendencies had been almost wholly good. For it is in the nature of prose\r\nnot to admit of too absolute regulation, and it is at the same time in\r\nits nature to require that regulation up to a certain point. If the\r\nFrench vocabulary had been somewhat impoverished, it had been\r\nconsiderably refined. All good authorities admit that the influence of\r\nthe salon-coteries and the _precieuses_--mischievous as it was in some\r\nways--was of no small benefit in purifying not merely manners but\r\nspeech. A single book, the _Historiettes_ of Tallemant des Reaux, shows\r\nsufficiently the need of this double purification. French literature has\r\nat no time been distinguished by prudery, but from the fifteenth to the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century (for, as has been pointed out, the\r\ncourtly literature at least of the middle ages is free from this defect)\r\nit had added to its liberty in choice and treatment of subjects a\r\nliberty which amounted to the extremest licence in the choice of words.\r\nIt had become in fact exceedingly coarse. The poetry of the Pleiade was\r\nnot as a rule open to this charge, but the early poetry and prose of the\r\nseventeenth century must submit to it. One effect of the process of\r\ncorrection and reform was a decided improvement in this matter.\r\n\r\nBut the vocabulary was by no means the only thing that underwent\r\nrevision. Other constituents of literature shared in the same\r\nexperience, and much more beneficially, for the expurgation of the\r\ndictionary was unfortunately made to involve the weeding out of many\r\nterms which were not open to the slightest exception, and the loss of\r\nwhich deprived the tongue of much of its picturesqueness. No such\r\nconcomitant defect attended the reformations in grammar which, begun by\r\nthe grammarians of the sixteenth century, were pursued still more\r\nsystematically by Vaugelas and his followers. There can hardly be too\r\nmuch precision observed in matters of accidence and syntax; while it is\r\ndesirable that the vocabulary should be as rich as possible, provided\r\nthat its terms are vernacular or properly naturalised. The same may be\r\nsaid of some at least of the reforms of Malherbe in prosody and the\r\nminutiae of poetical art. So too the advance made to something like a\r\nuniform orthography was of no small importance. The result of this\r\ngeneral criticism was the group (or rather groups, for they may be\r\ndivided into at least two, the earlier comprising Descartes, Corneille,\r\nPascal, Saint Evremond, La Rochefoucauld, Bossuet, Madame de Sevigne, La\r\nFontaine, and Moliere, in other words, most of the greatest names)\r\nillustrating the so-called _Grand Siecle_, or Siecle de Louis Quatorze.\r\nThe two names that stand first in this list, Descartes and Corneille,\r\nrepresent at once the initial change and in addition the greatest\r\naccomplishment in the direction of change effected by any individual.\r\nThe others worthily followed where they led. This group, as has been\r\nmore than once pointed out, does not shine in poetry proper. But it has\r\nhardly a rival in prose and in that measured and declamatory or easy and\r\npedestrian verse which is half prose, half poetry.\r\n\r\nLong, however, before the century ended, the evils which invariably\r\nattend upon a critical period, especially--it is paradoxical but\r\ntrue--when it is at the same time a period of considerable creative\r\npower, began to manifest themselves. These evils may be briefly\r\ndescribed as the natural results of the drawing up of too straight and\r\ndefinite rules for each department of literature, and the following with\r\ntoo great exactness of the more brilliant examples in each kind. The one\r\npractice leads to what is called, in Sterne's well-known phrase,\r\n'looking at the stop-watch;' the other, to an endeavour to be like\r\nsomebody. It was not till the eighteenth century that these evils were\r\nfully patent; and then, though they were somewhat mitigated in\r\ndepartments other than the Belles Lettres by the eager spirit of enquiry\r\nand adventure which characterised the time, they are evident enough. The\r\nmischief showed itself in various ways. Besides the two which have been\r\nalready indicated, there was a third and subtler form, which has\r\nproduced some curious and interesting work, but which is obviously an\r\nindication of decadence. Those who did not resign themselves to the mere\r\nrecasting of old material in the old moulds, or to simple following of\r\nthe great models, were apt to echo, aloud or silently, La Bruyere's\r\nopening sentence, 'tout est dit,' and to draw from this discouraging\r\nfact the same conclusion that he did--that the only way to innovate was\r\nto vary in cunning fashion the manners of saying. In itself there might\r\nbe no great harm in the conclusion, especially if it had led to a revolt\r\nagainst the narrow limits imposed by current criticism. But it did not,\r\nit only led to an attempt to innovate within those limits, which could\r\nonly be done by a kind of new 'preciousness'--an affectation in short.\r\nThis affectation showed itself first (though La Bruyere himself is not\r\nquite free from it, enemy of Fontenelle as he was) in Fontenelle, who\r\nwas a descendant of the old _precieuse_ school itself, and reached a\r\nclimax in the author from whose name it thenceforward took its name of\r\n_Marivaudage_.\r\n\r\nThus the literary produce of the seventeenth century was better than its\r\ntendency. The latter has been sufficiently described; a very few words\r\nwill suffice for the former. In the special characteristics of the\r\ngenius of French, which may be said to be clearness, polish of form and\r\nexpression, and a certain quality which perhaps cannot be so well\r\nexpressed by any other word as by alertness, the best work of the\r\nseventeenth century has no rivals. Except in Corneille and Bossuet, it\r\nis not often grand, it is still seldomer passionate, or suggestively\r\nharmonious, or quaintly humorous, or even picturesquely narrative. But\r\nthe charm of precision, of elegance, of expressing what is expressed in\r\nthe best possible manner, belongs to it in a supreme degree. There are\r\nnot many things in literature more absolutely incapable of improvement\r\nin their own style, and as far as they go, than a scene of Moliere, a\r\n_tirade_ of Racine, a maxim of La Rochefoucauld, a letter of Madame de\r\nSevigne, a character of La Bruyere, a peroration of Massillon, when each\r\nis at his or her best. The reader may in some cases feel that he likes\r\nsomething else better, but he is incapable of pointing out a blemish. If\r\nhe objects, he must object to something extra-literary, to the writer's\r\nconception of human nature, his political views, his range of thought,\r\nhis selection of subject. When the one supreme question of criticism\r\nformulated by Victor Hugo, 'l'ouvrage est-il bon ou est-il mauvais?'\r\n(not 'aimez-vous l'ouvrage?' which is the illegitimate question which\r\nnine critics out of ten put to themselves), is set in reference to the\r\nbest work of this time, the answer cannot be dubious for one moment in\r\nthe case of any one qualified to give an answer at all. It is good, and\r\nin very many cases it could not possibly be better.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[283] p. 267.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPOETS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Literary Degeneracy of the Eighteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nThe literature of the eighteenth century, despite the many great names\r\nwhich adorn it, and the extraordinary practical influence which it\r\nexercised, is, from the point of view of strict literary criticism,\r\nwhich busies itself with form rather than matter, a period of decadence.\r\nIn all the departments of Belles Lettres a servile imitation of the\r\nmodels of the great classical period is observable. The language,\r\naccording to an inevitable process which the more clearsighted of the\r\nmen of Louis the Fourteenth's time, such as Fenelon and La Bruyere,\r\nthemselves foresaw and deprecated, became more and more incapable of\r\nexpressing deep passion, varied scenery, the intricacies and\r\neccentricities of character. For a time a few survivors of the older\r\nclass and manner, such as Fontenelle, Saint Simon, Massillon, resisted\r\nthe tendency of the age more or less successfully. As they one by one\r\ndropped off, the militant energy of the great _philosophe_ movement,\r\nwhich may be said to coincide with the second and third quarters of the\r\ncentury, communicated a temporary brilliance to prose. But during the\r\nreign of Louis XVI., the Revolution and the Empire (for in the widest\r\nsense the eighteenth century of literature does not cease till the\r\nRestoration, or even later), the average literary value of what is\r\nwritten in French is but small, and, with few exceptions, what is\r\nvaluable belongs to those who, consciously or unconsciously, were in an\r\nattitude of revolt, and were clearing the way for the men of 1830.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: especially manifest in Poetry.]\r\n\r\nPoetry and the drama naturally suffered most from this course of events,\r\nand poetry pure and simple suffered even more than the drama. By the\r\nopening of the eighteenth century epic and lyric in the proper sense had\r\nbeen rendered nearly impossible by the full and apparently final\r\nadoption of the conception of poetry recommended by Malherbe, and\r\nfinally rendered orthodox by Boileau. The impossibility was not\r\nrecognised, and France, in the opinion of her own critics, at last got\r\nher epic poem in the _Henriade_, and her perfect lyrists in Rousseau and\r\nLebrun. But posterity has not ratified these judgments. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, the men of the eighteenth century had in La Fontaine a model\r\nfor lighter work which their principles permitted them to follow, and\r\nthe irresistible attractions of the song left song-writers tolerably\r\nfree from the fatal restrictions of dignified poetry. Once, towards the\r\nclose of the century, a poet of exceptional genius, Andre Chenier,\r\nshowed what he might have done under happier circumstances. But for the\r\nmost part the history of poetry during this time in France is the\r\nhistory of verse almost uninspired by the poetic spirit, and destitute\r\neven of the choicer graces of poetic form.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: J. B. Rousseau.]\r\n\r\nFor convenience' sake it will be well to separate the graver and the\r\nlighter poets, and to treat each in order, with the proviso that in most\r\ncases those mentioned in the first division have some claim to figure in\r\nthe second also, for few poets of the time were wholly serious. The\r\nfirst poet who is distinctively of the eighteenth century, and not the\r\nleast remarkable, was Jean Baptiste Rousseau[284] (1669-1741).\r\nRousseau's life was a singular and rather an unfortunate one. In the\r\nfirst place he was exiled for a piece of scandalous literature, of which\r\nin all probability he was quite guiltless; and, in the second, meeting\r\nin his exile with Voltaire, who professed (and seems really to have\r\nfelt) admiration for him, he offended the irritable disciple and was\r\nlong the butt of his attacks. Here, however, Rousseau concerns us as a\r\ndirect pupil of Boileau, who, with great faculties for the formal part\r\nof poetry, and not without some tincture of its spirit, set himself to\r\nbe a lyric poet after Boileau's fashion. He tried play-writing also, but\r\nhis dramas are quite unimportant. Rousseau's principal works are certain\r\nodes, most of which are either panegyrical after the fashion of the\r\ncelebrated Namur specimen (though he is seldom so absurd as his master),\r\nor else sacred and drawn from the Bible. The _Cantates_ are of the same\r\nkind as the latter. These elaborate and formal works, which owed much of\r\ntheir popularity to the vogue given to piety at court in the later years\r\nof Louis XVI., are curiously contrasted with the third principal\r\ndivision of his poems, consisting of epigrams which allow themselves the\r\nfull epigrammatic licence in subject and treatment. The contrast is,\r\nhowever, probably due to a very simple cause, the state of demand at the\r\ntime, and perhaps also to the study of Marot, the only pre-seventeenth\r\ncentury poet of France who was allowed to pass muster in the school of\r\nBoileau. Rousseau's merits have been already indicated, and his defects\r\nmay be easily divined, even from this brief notice. He is almost always\r\nadroit, often eloquent, sometimes remarkably clever; but he is seldom\r\nother than artificial, never passionate, and only once or twice sublime.\r\nNor is it superfluous to mention that he is more responsible than any\r\nother person for the intolerable frippery of classical mythology which\r\nloads eighteenth-century verse.\r\n\r\nLa Motte-Houdart (1672-1731), a successful dramatist, an excellent\r\nprose-writer, and an ingenious but paradoxical critic, was at the time\r\nconsidered Rousseau's rival in point of ode-making. His work displays\r\nthe same defects in a greater and the same merits in a lesser degree,\r\nbut his fables in the style of La Fontaine are not unhappy.\r\nLagrange-Chancel, a partisan of the Duchess du Maine, is chiefly famous\r\nfor his ferocious satires on the Duke of Orleans. Louis Racine\r\n(1692--1763), undeterred by his father's reputation and the dissuasion\r\nof the redoubtable Boileau, attempted poetry of a serious kind. He was\r\nbrought up by the Jansenists, and his two chief works are poems on\r\n'Grace' and 'Religion.' The latter is better than the former; but both\r\nexhibit a considerable faculty in the style of verse which his father\r\nhad made fashionable. The 'Sacred Odes' of Louis Racine are, like most\r\nFrench poetry of the kind, stiff with a double mannerism, literary and\r\ndevotional.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Voltaire.]\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy to give a clearer idea of the strange conception of\r\npoetry which prevailed in France at this time than is given in the\r\nsimple statement that Voltaire was acknowledged to be its greatest poet.\r\nIt is probable that few Englishmen think of Voltaire as a poet at all;\r\nand he has indeed no claim to the title except such as may be derived\r\nfrom his remarkable skill in the mechanism of the art of poetry, and\r\nfrom the extraordinary felicity of his light occasional pieces. It is,\r\nhowever, as a poet that he was chiefly regarded by his contemporaries;\r\nand though he will figure in almost every one of the chapters of this\r\nbook, such brief notice of his life as can alone be attempted in this\r\nvolume may best be given here. He was born in Paris in 1694, being the\r\nyounger son of a wealthy notary. The Jesuits had charge of his\r\neducation, and he very early displayed inclinations towards verse which\r\nwere not agreeable to his father. His youth seemed destined to scrapes.\r\nHe became identified with the party hostile to the Regent, and was twice\r\nimprisoned in the Bastile (the second time in consequence of no fault of\r\nhis own), while he was at least twice bastinadoed by personal enemies.\r\nBeing sent in the suite of an ambassador to Holland, he became entangled\r\nin a foolish love affair, and had to be hastily recalled. But by degrees\r\nhis literary talent developed itself. His first visit to the Bastile is\r\nidentified, more or less correctly, with the composition of _Oedipe_,\r\nhis second with that of the _Henriade_. After his second release he had\r\nto go to England, and there the poem was published. He was soon enabled\r\nto return to France, and from that time forward was careful to keep\r\nhimself out of difficulties by residing first with his friend, Madame du\r\nChatelet, at the remote frontier chateau of Circy, then with Frederick\r\nII. at Berlin, then on the neutral territory of Switzerland, or close to\r\nits border, at Les Delices and Ferney. During the whole of his long life\r\nhis literary production was incessant, and the form most congenial to\r\nhim was poetry, or at least verse. Besides the _Henriade_, his only\r\npoem of great bulk is the scandalous burlesque epic of the _Pucelle_,\r\nnominally imitated from Ariosto, but destitute of the poetical feeling\r\nprominent in the _Orlando_. Voltaire's talent, however, was so much\r\ngreater in the lighter kinds of poetry than in the severer, that the\r\n_Pucelle_ is not only more amusing, but actually better as poetry, than\r\nthe _Henriade_, the latter being stiff in plan and servilely modelled on\r\nthe classical epics, declamatory in tone, tedious in action, and\r\ncommonplace in character. Besides these two long poems Voltaire produced\r\nan immense quantity of miscellaneous work, tales in verse, epistles in\r\nverse, discourses in verse, satires, epigrams, _vers de societe_ of\r\nevery possible kind. These are almost invariably distinguished by the\r\nfelicity of expression--spoilt only by too close adherence to the\r\nmannerism of the time--the brilliant wit, the keen observation which are\r\nidentified with the name of Voltaire. The number and the small\r\nindividual size of these works make it impossible to particularise them\r\nhere. But _Le Pauvre Diable_ may be specified as an almost unique\r\nexample of easy Horatian satire less conventional than most of its kind;\r\nand the verses to the Princess Ulrique of Prussia as a model of\r\nartificial but exquisitely polished gallantry in verse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Descriptive Poets. Delille.]\r\n\r\nLe Franc de Pompignan had the misfortune to incur the enmity of\r\nVoltaire, and has consequently borne in France the traditional ignominy\r\nwhich in England hangs on certain victims of Dryden and Pope. He had,\r\nhowever, some poetical talent, which was shown principally in his ode on\r\nthe death of J. B. Rousseau. The charming poem of _Ver-Vert_ (the\r\nburlesque history of a parrot, the pet of a convent) made, and not\r\nunjustly, the reputation of Gresset. This reputation his other poetical\r\nworks--though he wrote a comedy of much merit--failed to sustain. Saint\r\nLambert, the rival of Voltaire in love if not in literature, imitated\r\nThomson's _Seasons_ very closely in a poem of the same name, which set\r\nthe fashion of descriptive poetry in France for a considerable time. The\r\nthree most remarkable of his followers, all considerably superior to\r\nhimself in power, were Lemierre, Delille, and Roucher. Some paradoxical\r\ncritics have endeavoured to make Lemierre into a great poet; but his\r\npoems (_La Peinture_, _Les Fastes_, etc.), written on ill-selected\r\nsubjects and in a style full of conventional mannerism, have at best the\r\noccasional striking lines which are to be found in Armstrong and other\r\nfollowers of Young or Thomson in England. Jacques Delille and his\r\nextraordinary popularity form, perhaps, the greatest satire on the taste\r\nof the eighteenth century in France. His translation of the Georgics was\r\nsupposed to make him the equal of Virgil, and brought him not merely\r\nfame, but solid reward. His principal work was the poem of _Les\r\nJardins_, which he followed up with others of a not dissimilar kind.\r\nThough he emigrated he did not lose his fame, and to the day of his\r\ndeath was considered to be the first poet of France, or to share that\r\nhonour with Lebrun-_Pindare_. Delille has expiated his popularity by a\r\nfull half-century of contempt, and his work is, indeed, valueless as\r\npoetry. But it is interesting as one of the most striking examples of\r\ntalent, adjusting itself exactly to the demands made on it. The age of\r\nDelille wished to see everything described in elegant periphrases, and\r\nthe periphrases arranged in harmonious verses. Delille did this and\r\nnothing more. Chess is 'le jeu reveur qu'inventa Palamede.' Backgammon\r\nis 'le jeu bruyant ou, le cornet en main, L'adroit joueur calcule un\r\nhasard incertain.' Sugar is 'le miel Americain Que du suc des roseaux\r\nexprima l'Africain.' In short, poetry becomes an elaborate conundrum;\r\nnothing is called by its proper name when a circumlocution is in any way\r\npossible. Given the demand, Delille may justly claim the honour of\r\nsupplying it with unequalled adroitness. Roucher, the author of _Les\r\nMois_, who fell a victim to the guillotine, was a member of this school,\r\npossessing not a little vigour, though he was not free from the defects\r\nof his predecessors. To these may, perhaps, be joined the pastoral and\r\nidyllic poet Leonard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lebrun.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the glory of Delille as the greatest poet of the\r\nlast quarter of the century was shared by a writer whom his\r\ncontemporaries surnamed (absurdly enough) Pindar. Escouchard Lebrun had\r\na strange resemblance to J. B. Rousseau, of whom, however, he was by no\r\nmeans a warm admirer. Like his forerunner, he divided his time between\r\nbombastic lyrics and epigrams of very considerable merit. Lebrun was\r\nnot destitute of a certain force, but his time was too much for him. He\r\nwas a very long-lived man, and in his old age celebrated by turns the\r\nRepublic and Bonaparte. His chief rivals as poets of the Republic were\r\nM. J. Chenier and the hunchback Desorgues, a voluminous and vigorous but\r\ncrude and unfinished writer, who died in a madhouse at the age of\r\nforty-five.\r\n\r\nTwo young poets, who lived about the middle of the century, are usually\r\nmentioned together, from the fact of the younger of them having used the\r\nmisfortunes of the elder to point his own complaints. Malfilatre, a\r\nNorman by birth, had the ill-luck to write a piece of verse which gained\r\na provincial success. He at once set out for Paris to make his fortune.\r\nHe obtained the post of secretary to the Count de Lauraguais, wrote\r\nverses not without grace and full of a certain tender melancholy, and\r\ndied at the age of thirty, his health broken by privations and\r\ndisappointment. Gilbert, a stronger man, but who has been somewhat\r\nhonoured by being called the French Chatterton, died still younger,\r\nafter writing some vigorous satire, and a 'complaint' or elegy which has\r\na good deal of pathos. But he did not, as is generally said, die of\r\nwant, though he did die in a public hospital, having been carried\r\nthither after a fall from his horse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parny.]\r\n\r\nThe places accorded by their contemporaries to Delille and Lebrun really\r\nbelonged to two writers of very different character and fortune, Parny\r\nand Andre Chenier. Evariste de Parny, a native of the island of Bourbon,\r\nwas called by the aged Voltaire 'mon cher Tibulle,' and displays, with\r\nmuch of the frivolity and false gallantry of the time, an extraordinary\r\ncommand of simple elegiac verse, and a manner almost antique in its\r\nsimplicity and sweetness. Parny's best piece, a short epitaph on a young\r\ngirl, is one of the best things of its kind in literature. His merits,\r\nhowever, are confined to his early works. In his maturer years he wrote\r\nlong poems, on the model of the _Pucelle_, against England,\r\nChristianity, and Monarchism, which are equally remarkable for\r\nblasphemy, obscenity, extravagance, and dulness. His friend Bertin, like\r\nhim a creole, resembled him in the command of graceful elegiac and\r\nepistolary verse, but had not what Parny sometimes had, genuine\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chenier.]\r\n\r\nAndre Marie de Chenier[285], beyond question the greatest poet of the\r\neighteenth century in France, was born at Constantinople, where his\r\nfather was consul-general, in 1762. His mother was a Greek. His family\r\nreturned to France when he was a child; he was educated carefully, and\r\nfor a short time served in the army, but soon left it. After a time he\r\nwas attached (in 1787) to the French embassy in London. Here he spent\r\nfour years. Returning to France he sympathised, but on the moderate\r\nside, with the Revolution. The growth of the Jacobin spirit horrified\r\nhim, and the excesses of the summer of 1792 decided his attitude and his\r\nfate. He wrote frequently in the _Journal de Paris_, the organ of the\r\nmoderate royalist party. Although he did not in any way put himself\r\nforward, he was at last arrested in March, 1794, and was guillotined on\r\nthe seventh Thermidor, two days only before the event which would have\r\nsaved him, the fall of Robespierre. His poems were not published till\r\nlong after his death, and the text of them is even now in an\r\nunsatisfactory condition, many having been left unfinished and\r\nuncorrected by the author. Andre Chenier is sometimes considered as a\r\nprecursor of the Romantic reform, but this is a mistake. His critical\r\ncomments on Shakespeare and other writers, his favourite studies, which\r\nwere confined to the Greek and Latin classics and the humanists of the\r\nItalian Renaissance, above all his poems themselves, prove the contrary.\r\nA Greek by birthplace, and half a Greek by blood, his tastes and\r\nstandards were wholly classical. But the fire and force of his poetical\r\ngenius made the blood circulate afresh in the veins of the old French\r\nclassical tradition, without, however, permanently strengthening or\r\nrenovating it. The poetry of Chenier is still in the main the poetry of\r\nRacine, though with infinitely more glow of colour and variety of\r\nharmony. His poems are mostly antique in their titles and plan,\r\neclogues, elegies, and so forth, and are not free from a certain\r\nartificiality inseparable from the style. _La Jeune Tarentine_, _La\r\nJeune Captive_, _L'Aveugle_, and some others, are of extreme merit, and\r\nall over his work (much of which is in the most fragmentary condition)\r\nlines and phrases of extraordinary beauty are scattered. The noble\r\n_Iambes_, or political and satirical poems, which he wrote in prison,\r\njust before his death, bear out, perhaps better than anything else, his\r\nwell-known saying, as he touched his head when sentence had been passed,\r\n'et pourtant il y avait quelque chose la.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Poets.]\r\n\r\nA few other poets or verse-makers of merit before the revival of poetry\r\nproper must be rapidly noticed. The fable of La Fontaine was cultivated\r\nvigorously, in particular by Florian, a favourite pupil of Voltaire, who\r\nwill reappear in these pages. Florian's fables are graceful copies of\r\nhis master. Those of Arnault, with less grace, have more originality;\r\noften, indeed, Arnault's short moral poems are not so much fables as\r\nwhat used to be called in English 'emblems.' The most famous of these,\r\nwhich of itself deserves to keep Arnault's memory green, is 'La\r\nFeuille.' Marie Joseph Chenier, the younger brother of Andre, and,\r\nunlike him, a fervent republican, is chiefly known as a dramatist. He\r\nhad, however, a vein of satirical verse, which was not commonplace.\r\nAnother dramatist, Andrieux, also deserves mention in passing. Superior\r\nto either of these as a poet, and wanting only the good-fortune of\r\nhaving been born a little later, was Nepomucene Lemercier, a playwright\r\nof no small merit, and a poet of extraordinary but unequal vigour. The\r\n_Panhypocrisiade_, a kind of satirical epic _par personnages_ (to use\r\nthe old French expression for a dramatic narrative), is his principal\r\nwork, and a very remarkable one. Last of all have to be mentioned\r\nFontanes and Chenedolle, who are the characteristic poets of the Empire,\r\nwith the exception of an epic school of no value. The chief importance\r\nof Fontanes in literature is derived not from any performances of his\r\nown, but from the fact that he was the appointed intermediary between\r\nNapoleon and the men of letters of the time, and was able to exercise a\r\ngood deal of useful patronage. Chenedolle was in production, if not in\r\npublication, for he published late in life, a precursor of Lamartine,\r\nmuch of whose style and manner may be found in him. An amiable\r\nappreciation of natural beauty, and a tendency to facile pathos, derived\r\nfrom the contemplation of natural objects, distinguish him from his\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Light verse. Piron.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Desaugiers.]\r\n\r\nThe vigorous, if not always edifying, work of the song-writers and\r\nauthors of _vers de societe_ during this century remains to be noticed.\r\nThe example of La Fontaine's tales was followed by many writers of more\r\ntalent than scruple, but their literary value is not sufficient to\r\nentitle them to a place here. No history of French literature, however,\r\nwould be complete without a notice of Piron, the greatest epigrammatist\r\nof France, and one of her keenest and brightest wits. Piron's temper was\r\nan idle one, and he did little solid work in literature, except his\r\nepigrams and one comedy, _La Metromanie_. He wrote many vaudevilles and\r\noperettas, and no one, with the possible exception of Catullus, has ever\r\nexcelled him in the art of packing in a few light and graceful lines the\r\ngreatest possible quantity of malicious wit. Panard, also a\r\nvaudevillist, is remarkable for the number and excellence of his\r\ndrinking songs, and the variety and melody of their rhythm. Colle,\r\nauthor of amusing but spiteful memoirs, and, like Piron and Panard, a\r\nwriter of comic operettas, excelled rather in the political chanson.\r\nGentil Bernard, the Cardinal de Bernis, the Abbe Boufflers, and Dorat,\r\nwere all writers of _vers de societe_, the last being much the best.\r\nTheir style of writing was frivolous and conventional in the extreme,\r\nbut long practice and the vogue which it enjoyed in French society had\r\nbrought it to something like the condition of a fine art. Dorat was\r\nsurnamed by a contemporary the 'glowworm of Parnassus.' The expression\r\nwas not an unhappy one, and may be fairly applied to the other authors\r\nwho have been mentioned in his company. He himself was a rather\r\nvoluminous author in different styles. The literary baggage of the\r\nothers is not heavy. Vade, a writer of light and trifling verse, who\r\ndied comparatively young, devoted himself to composing poems in the\r\n'poissard' dialect of Paris, which are among the best of such things. At\r\nthe close of the century, and deserving more particular notice, appeared\r\nDesaugiers, the best light song-writer of France, with the single\r\nexception of Beranger, and preferred to him by some critics. Desaugiers\r\nescaped the revolution by good fortune, had a short but rather\r\nadventurous career of foreign travel, and then settled down to\r\nvaudeville-writing, song-making, and jovial living in Paris. He was a\r\ngreat frequenter of the Caveau, a kind of irregular club of men of\r\nletters which had been instituted by Piron and his friends, and which\r\nlong continued to be a literary and social rendezvous. Desaugiers was\r\nthe last of the older class of _Chansonniers_, who relied chiefly on\r\nlove and wine for their subjects, and who, if they touched on politics\r\nat all, touched on them merely from the personal and satirical point of\r\nview, with occasional indulgence in cheap patriotism. His songs have\r\ngreat sweetness and ease, but they contain nothing that can compare with\r\nBeranger in his more serious and pathetic mood[286].\r\n\r\nThis is a sketch, necessarily and designedly rapid, of the poetical\r\nhistory of the eighteenth century in France. The matter thus rapidly\r\ntreated is of no small interest to professed students of literature; it\r\nabounds in curious social indications; it gives frequent instances of\r\nthe extremest ingenuity applied to somewhat unworthy use. But in the\r\nhistory of the literature as a whole, and to those who have to regard it\r\nnot as a collection of curiosities, but as a fruitful field of great and\r\nnoble work, it cannot but be of subordinate interest, and as such\r\nrequires but cursory treatment here[287].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[284] Editions of almost all authors of any merit from the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century are common and accessible enough. They will,\r\ntherefore, not be specially indicated henceforward unless there is some\r\nspecial reason for the citation, such as the peculiar elegance or\r\nliterary merit of a particular edition, or else the comparative rarity\r\nof the book in any form.\r\n\r\n[285] Chenier has been somewhat unfortunate in his editors. The only\r\ncomplete and accurate edition (though it is far from perfect) is that of\r\nM. Gabriel de Chenier. 3 vols. 1879.\r\n\r\n[286] Excellent selections from many of these lighter poets have\r\nrecently been put forth under the editorship of M. Octave Uzanne.\r\n\r\n[287] Rouget de L'Isle, the author of the famous _Marseillaise_,\r\ndeserves mention for that only. He published poems, but their singular\r\ndifference from, and inferiority to, his masterpiece were the chief\r\ncauses of the scepticism (apparently ill-founded) which has sometimes\r\nbeen displayed as to his authorship of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDRAMATISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divisions of Drama.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: La Motte.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, and indeed during the whole course, of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the theatre continued to enjoy all the vogue which the\r\nextraordinary brilliancy of the authors of the preceding age had\r\nconferred on it. There were three tolerably distinct kinds of dramatic\r\nwork--tragedy, comedy, and opera--the latter either artificial or comic,\r\nand subdividing itself into a great many classes, from the dignified\r\nopera of the Comedie Francaise and the Comedie Italienne, down to the\r\nvaudevilles and operettas of the so-called 'fair' theatre, _Theatre de\r\nla Foire_. Towards the middle of the century there grew up a fourth\r\nclass, to which the not very appropriate and still less definite name of\r\n_drame_ is applied. This was subdivided, also somewhat arbitrarily, into\r\n_tragedie bourgeoise_ and _comedie larmoyante_. Thus the dramatic author\r\nhad considerable liberty of choice except in tragedy proper, where the\r\nmodel of Racine was enforced on him with pitiless rigour. La Motte, who\r\nwas, as has been said, a brilliant writer of prose, endeavoured to break\r\nthese bonds, first, by decrying the alleged superiority of the ancients;\r\nsecondly, by attacking the theory of the unities; and, lastly, by boldly\r\ndenying the necessity of verse in tragedy, and still more the necessity\r\nof rhyme. He was, of course, answered, and the only one of the answers\r\nwhich has much interest for posterity is that which Voltaire prefixed to\r\nthe second edition of _Oedipe_. This is, as always with its author,\r\nlively and ingenious, but ill-informed, destitute of true critical\r\nprinciples, and entirely inconclusive. La Motte himself wrote a tragedy,\r\n_Ines de Castro_, in which he did not venture to carry out his own\r\nprinciples, and which had some success. But the justice of his\r\nstrictures was best shown by the increasing feebleness of French tragedy\r\nthroughout the century. Were it not for the prodigious genius of\r\nVoltaire, not a single tragedy of the age would now have much chance of\r\nbeing read, still less of being performed; and were it not for that\r\ngenius, and the unequal but still remarkable talent of Crebillon the\r\nelder, not a single tragedy of the age would be worth reading for any\r\nmotive except curiosity, simple or studious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crebillon the Elder.]\r\n\r\nCrebillon was born in 1674, and lived to the age of eighty-nine. His\r\nfamily name was Jolyot, and the most remarkable thing about his private\r\nhistory is, that, being clerk to a lawyer, he was enthusiastically\r\nencouraged by his master in his poetical attempts. His first acted\r\ntragedy, _Idomenee_, appeared in 1703; his last, 'The Triumvirate,' more\r\nthan fifty years later. In the interval he was irregularly busy, and the\r\nduel of tragedies, which in his old age his partisans got up between him\r\nand Voltaire, was not entirely in favour of the more famous and gifted\r\nwriter. Crebillon's best works were _Atree_, 1707, and _Rhadamiste et\r\nZenobie_, 1711, the latter being his masterpiece. He had in the eyes of\r\nthe minute critics of his time some technical defects of style and\r\nconstruction. But, despite the restraints of the French stage, he\r\nsucceeded in being truly tragical and truly natural; and not a few of\r\nhis verses have a grandeur which has been said to be hardly discoverable\r\nelsewhere in French tragedy between Corneille and Hugo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Voltaire and his followers.]\r\n\r\nVoltaire's own tragedies have been very differently judged by different\r\npersons. It has been said that they owed their popularity chiefly to the\r\nadroit manner in which, without going too far, the author made them\r\nopportunities for insinuating the popular opinions of the time. Yet\r\n_Zaire_ at least is still a successful and popular play on the stage;\r\nand it is admitted that Voltaire had both a most intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the objects and methods of the playwright, and an extraordinary\r\naffection for the theatre. If to this be added his astonishing dexterity\r\nas a literary workman, his acuteness in discerning the taste of the\r\npublic, and his complete mastery of the language, and if it be\r\nremembered that the classical French tragedy is almost wholly a _tour\r\nde force_, it will appear that it would have been very surprising if he\r\nhad not succeeded in it. His tragedies, however, are by no means of\r\nequal merit. The best is, beyond all doubt, the already-mentioned\r\n_Zaire_, 1732, in which Voltaire took just so much from the _Othello_ of\r\nthat Shakespeare whom he was never tired of decrying as would suffice to\r\nanimate and support his own skilful workmanship. The earlier play,\r\n_Oedipe_, 1718, was astonishingly successful, and is still\r\nastonishingly clever. _La Mort de Cesar_, another Shakespearian\r\nadaptation, is less happy. In _Alzire_, a play written in the time of\r\nthe poet's greatest intimacy with Madame du Chatelet, and dedicated to\r\nher, his extraordinary talent once more appears, as also in _Le\r\nFanatisme_, better known as _Mahomet_, 1742. The best, however, of his\r\nplays, next to _Zaire_, is probably _Merope_, 1743, which is a prodigy\r\nof ingenuity. The author has deliberately eschewed the means whereby\r\nboth Corneille and Racine respectively alleviated the dryness and\r\ndulness of the Senecan model--the heroic virtues of the one, and the\r\nsighs and flames of the other. The play probably is the most perfect\r\ncarrying out of the model pure and simple, and its inferiority is the\r\ninferiority of the kind, not of the individual. Indeed it may be\r\nquestioned whether, on the mere technical merits, Voltaire is not\r\nsuperior to both Corneille and Racine, though he is of course very far\r\ninferior to them as a poet, and as a draughtsman of character. Voltaire\r\nwrote many other plays, earlier and later, of which _Tancrede_ is the\r\nonly one which requires special mention. Nor, except Crebillon, do the\r\ntragic contemporaries and successors of Voltaire require more than very\r\nshort notice. Le Franc de Pompignan wrote a respectable _Didon_; Saurin,\r\nwho was in some sort a follower of Voltaire, a more than respectable\r\n_Spartacus_. The subject had perhaps the chief part in the success of\r\nthe _Siege de Calais_ of Pierre Burette, who called himself De Belloy,\r\nand who followed it up by other patriotic tragedies or dramas. But he\r\nhad the merit of attempting, though not with much success, some\r\ninnovations on the meagreness of the established model. The tragedies of\r\nLa Harpe are written throughout with the cold correctness (as\r\ncorrectness was then held) which characterised his work generally.\r\nAlmost all the men of letters of this time wrote plays of this kind, but\r\nthey are for the most part valueless. Ducis is remarkable for a serious,\r\nand to a certain extent successful, attempt to inoculate the French\r\ntragedy with Shakespearian force. Versions of _Hamlet_, of _Macbeth_,\r\nand other plays appeared from his hands, which were also busy during a\r\nlong life with dramatic work of all sorts. These versions have naturally\r\nbeen regarded in England as mere travesties, but there seems no reason\r\nto doubt that they really operated favourably as schoolmasters to bring\r\ntheir audience somewhat nearer to dramatic truth. The classical tragedy\r\nwas indeed expiring of simple old age, and most of the names of its\r\npractitioners, which emerge during the last quarter of the eighteenth\r\nand the first of the nineteenth century, are those of innovators in\r\ntheir measure and degree, whose innovations, however, were obliterated\r\nand made forgotten by the great romantic reform. Marie Joseph Chenier\r\nfollowed Voltaire's manner very closely (substituting for Voltaire's\r\nbait of insinuated free-thinking that of republicanism more or less\r\nviolently expressed) in _Charles IX._, _Cyrus_, _Caius Gracchus_, _Henry\r\nVIII._, _Tibere_, the last a work of some merit. Legouve dramatised\r\nGessner's _Death of Abel_ on the principles of Boileau. Nepomucene\r\nLemercier, the strange failure of a genius who has been already noticed\r\nin the last chapter, produced much more remarkable work. His\r\n_Agamemnon_, his _Fredegonde et Brunehault_ and some others display his\r\nmerits, and show that he was striving after something better. But, like\r\nmost transitional work, they are unsatisfactory as a whole. The _Hector_\r\nof Luce de Lancival, the _Templiers_ of Raynouard, and many other\r\npieces, were once popular, but are now utterly forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lesage.]\r\n\r\nThe list of comic writers, along with whom, for convenience' sake, those\r\nof the authors of opera and _drame_ may be included, is far longer and\r\nmore important. It includes two men, Lesage and Beaumarchais, of\r\nEuropean reputation, half-a-dozen others, Destouches, Marivaux, Piron,\r\nGresset, Sedaine, who have produced work of remarkable character and\r\nmerit, and a crowd of clever playwrights who amused their own times, and\r\nwould amuse ours, if it were not that all comedy, save the very highest,\r\nis of its nature ephemeral. The list is worthily opened by Lesage, who,\r\nduring the greater part of his life, earned by vaudevilles and\r\noperettas, composed either alone or in co-operation for the Theatre de\r\nla Foire, the bread which his incomparable novels would hardly have\r\nsufficed to procure him. This lighter dramatic work is, it may be\r\nobserved, among the chief products of the century, and it has continued\r\nup to the present day to form one of the staple elements in the\r\njourney-work of French literature. Little of it has permanent qualities,\r\nyet the remarkable talents of many of the men who composed it make it,\r\nephemeral as it is, interesting historically and even intrinsically. It\r\nderived partly from the indigenous farce, partly from the Italian comedy\r\nof stock personages, and partly from the merry-andrew performances\r\nalready mentioned. The theatres at which it was performed were the\r\nobject of much jealousy from the Comedie Francaise, and restrictions of\r\nthe most annoying kind were placed on it. Once an edict forbade more\r\nthan a single actor to appear--a condition surmounted by the ingenuity\r\nof Piron. Sometimes it was confined to dumb show, illustrated by songs\r\non placards which the audience chanted. Often the audience joined in the\r\nchorus, and it may be said generally that singing was always included.\r\nBesides this rapid and perishable kind of work Lesage has left two\r\npieces in the true style of Moliere. The more extravagant and farcical\r\nside of the master's genius is represented by _Crispin Rival de son\r\nMaitre_, 1707, a lively piece, the subject of which is indicated by its\r\ntitle, and which carries off the extreme and probably intentional\r\nimprobability of its plot by its brisk and rapid action, its vivid\r\npictures of character, and the shower of wit which the dialogue\r\neverywhere pours out. _Turcaret_, 1709, is a regular comedy of the\r\nhighest merit. It has been found fault with by some French critics,\r\nenamoured of the ruling passion and central situation theory; but this\r\nis really a testimony to its merit. _Turcaret_ is in the strictest sense\r\na criticism of life at the time, and the author shows the true\r\nprodigality of genius in filling his canvas. It is often described as a\r\nsatire on the corruption and vices of the financiers, who were the curse\r\nof France at the time; and this it is in part. But there are combined\r\nwith this satire of the loose morals of the nobility, the follies of\r\nprovincial coteries, the meanness of the trading classes; while each\r\ncharacter, instead of being an abstraction, is as sharp and individual\r\nas Gil Blas himself. Like Lesage, Piron worked much for the theatre;\r\nindeed he made his _debut_, as has been said, by venturing on a task\r\nwhich even Lesage had declined,--the writing of a comic opera with a\r\nsingle actor only. Like Lesage, too, he has left one comedy of durable\r\nreputation, _La Metromanie_, which, if it falls short of _Turcaret_ in\r\nholding up the mirror to nature, equals it in wit, and has for a French\r\naudience the attraction of being written in very good verse, while\r\n_Turcaret_ is in prose. With perhaps less genius than Piron, and\r\ncertainly with less than Lesage, Destouches devoted himself to a higher\r\nclass of work on the whole, and has left more pieces that are\r\nremembered. _Le Philosophe Marie_, 1727, and _Le Glorieux_, 1732, are\r\namong the classics of French comedy. _Le Dissipateur_, _Le Tambour\r\nNocturne_, _L'Obstacle Imprevu_ have also much merit; and if _La Fausse\r\nAgnes_ has something of the farcical in it, it is farce of the right\r\nkind. Destouches wrote seventeen comedies; and, if bulk and general\r\nmerit of work are taken together, he deserves the first place among the\r\ncomic dramatists of the century in France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comedie Larmoyante. La Chaussee. Diderot.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to these three writers, who all followed the traditions of\r\nthe comedy of Moliere and Regnard, Nivelle de la Chaussee invented, or\r\nat least brought into fashion, what was called _comedie larmoyante_, or\r\n_drame_. La Chaussee was a good deal ridiculed by his contemporaries,\r\nnotably by Piron, who devoted to him some of his most admirable\r\nepigrams. But he was popular, and not altogether undeservedly popular,\r\nthough his drama occupied in French literary history something of the\r\nsame place as that of Lillo and Moore in English. La Chaussee was\r\nfollowed by a greater writer, but a worse dramatist, than himself. While\r\nLa Chaussee was a clever versifier and an adroit playwright, Diderot\r\nunderstood the theory both of poetry and of the theatre much better than\r\nhe understood the practice. Thus _L'Ecole des Meres_, _La Gouvernante_,\r\n_Le Prejuge a la Mode_ are better plays than _Le Pere de Famille_ or _Le\r\nFils Naturel_. It ought to be said that Diderot succeeded better in two\r\nsmall pieces, _La Piece et le Prologue_ and _Est-il Bon? Est-il\r\nMechant?_ which were never acted. It should perhaps also be explained\r\nthat the peculiarity of what was almost indifferently called _tragedie\r\nbourgeoise_ and _comedie larmoyante_ is the choice of possible\r\nsituations in real life, which neither of the two conventional\r\ntreatments of heroic tragedy and comedy purely comic can afford. Many\r\nwriters followed La Chaussee and Diderot. Of these the most important\r\nperhaps was Saurin, who, not content with regular tragedy and comedy,\r\nobtained much success with _Beverley_, an adaptation of Moore's\r\n_Gamester_, of which Diderot wrote an unacted version.\r\n\r\n_L'Ecole des Bourgeois_ and _L'Embarras des Richesses_, by D'Allainval,\r\none of the few French writers who experienced the privations of their\r\nEnglish contemporaries in Grub Street, are good pieces, and so are the\r\nshort _La Pupille_ and the _Originaux_ of Fagan, a clerk in the public\r\nservice, who, like Lesage and Piron (Colle and Panard may be added),\r\nwrote vaudevilles, _parades_, etc. for the Theatre de la Foire. In the\r\ntitles of most of these pieces the close following of Moliere, which was\r\nusual, and wisely usual, during the first half of the century, may be\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marivaux.]\r\n\r\nThe same tradition is observed in one of the best comedies of the\r\ncentury, the _Mechant_ of Gresset, which, like his poem of _Ver-Vert_,\r\nhad a great success, and deserved it, being equally good as literature\r\nand as drama. Marivaux, without, perhaps, attaining as positive an\r\nexcellence, was more original, and very much more productive. The\r\nfullest edition of his dramatic works contains thirty-two pieces, and\r\neven this is not complete. Several of them, _Le Jeu de l'Amour et du\r\nHasard_, 1730, _Le Legs_, 1736, _Les Fausses Confidences_, 1737, have\r\ncontinued to be popular. All the work of Marivaux, dramatic and\r\nnon-dramatic, is pervaded more or less by a peculiarity which at the\r\ntime received the name of Marivaudage. This peculiarity consists partly\r\nin the sentiment, and partly in the phraseology. The former is\r\ncharacteristic of the eighteenth century, disguising a considerable\r\naffectation under a mask of simplicity, and the latter (sparkling with\r\nabundant, if somewhat precious wit) is ingeniously constructed to suit\r\nit and carry it off.\r\n\r\nOf the three greatest literary names of the time, Diderot, it has been\r\nseen, tried the theatre not too happily. Voltaire, as successful in\r\ntragedy as his models permitted him to be, was not successful at all in\r\ncomedy, and, indeed, rarely tried it. His best piece, _Nanine_, a\r\ndramatisation of _Pamela_, or at least suggested by it, is chiefly\r\nremarkable for being written in decasyllabic verse. The third, Rousseau,\r\nwho lived to denounce the theatre, wrote a short operetta, _Le Devin du\r\nVillage_, which is not without merit. Desmahis, a protege of Voltaire,\r\nproduced, in 1750, a good comedy, _L'Impertinent_, on a small scale; and\r\nLa Noue, another of his favourites (for he was as indulgent to his\r\njuniors as he was jealous of men of his own standing), the _Coquette\r\nCorrigee_. A third member of the same class, Saurin, already twice\r\nmentioned, must be mentioned again, and still more deservedly, for _Les\r\nMoeurs du Temps_. The best dramatists, however, among the immediate\r\nfollowers of the _Philosophes_ were Sedaine and Marmontel. Sedaine is,\r\nindeed, with the possible exception of Beaumarchais, the best dramatist\r\nof the last half of the century. _Le Philosophe sans le Savoir_, 1765,\r\nand _La Gageure Imprevue_, 1768, are both admirable pieces. The author,\r\nlike many of his predecessors, was a constant worker for the Opera\r\nComique, and one of the best of the class. Marmontel also adopted this\r\nline of composition, to which the musical talent of Gretry gave, at the\r\ntime, great advantages. His best light dramatic work is a kind of comedy\r\nvaudeville, the _Ami de la Maison_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beaumarchais.]\r\n\r\nBeyond all doubt, however, the most remarkable, if not the best,\r\ndramatist of the late eighteenth century is Beaumarchais. Some critics\r\nhave seen in the enormous success of the _Barbier de Seville_, 1775, and\r\nthe _Mariage de Figaro_, 1784, nothing but a _succes de circonstance_\r\nconnected with the political ideas which were then fermenting in men's\r\nminds. This seems to be unjust, or rather it is unjust not to recognise\r\nsomething very like genius in the manner in which the author has\r\nsucceeded in shaping his subject, without choosing a specially political\r\none, so as to produce the effect acknowledged. The wit of these two\r\nplays, moreover, is indisputable. But it may be allowed that\r\nBeaumarchais' other productions are inferior, and that his _Memoires_,\r\nwhich are not dramatic at all, contain as much wit as the Figaro plays.\r\nAs a satirist of society and a contributor of illustrations to history,\r\nBeaumarchais must always hold a very high place, higher perhaps than as\r\nan artist in literature. Of his life, it is enough to say that he was\r\nborn in 1731; became music master to the daughters of Louis XV.; engaged\r\nin a law-suit, the subject of the _Memoires_, with some high legal\r\nfunctionaries; made a fortune by speculating and by contracts in the\r\nAmerican war, and lost it by further speculations, one of which was the\r\npreparation of a sumptuous edition of Voltaire. Besides the Figaro\r\nplays, his chief dramatic works are _Eugenie_, _Les Deux Amis_, and\r\nlastly, _La Mere Coupable_, in which the characters of his two famous\r\nworks reappear.\r\n\r\nAfter Beaumarchais, but few comic authors demand mention. Collin\r\nd'Harleville, one of the pleasantest writers of light comedies in verse,\r\nproduced _Les Chateaux en Espagne_, _L'Inconstant_, _L'Optimiste_, and\r\n_Le Vieux Celibataire_, 1792, all sparkling pieces, which only need\r\nfreeing from the restraints of rhyme. Andrieux, the author of _Les\r\nEtourdis_, 1787, _Le Tresor_, _Le Vieux Fat_, and others, has something\r\nof the same character. Nepomucene Lemercier distinguished himself in\r\ncomedy, chiefly by _Plaute_, in irregular verse, and by a comedy-drama,\r\n_Pinto_, in prose. These have his usual characteristics of somewhat\r\nspasmodic genius. Fabre d'Eglantine, the companion of Danton and Camille\r\nDesmoulins on the scaffold, is better remembered for his death than for\r\nhis life. But his _Intrigue Epistolaire_ and _Philinte de Moliere_ shew\r\ntalent. _Le Sourd_, by Desforges, is an amusing play.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Characteristics of Eighteenth-century Drama.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the positive achievements of drama during this\r\nperiod were considerably superior to those of poetry. The tragedies of\r\nVoltaire are prodigies of literary cleverness. In comedy proper Lesage\r\nproduced work of enduring value; Destouches, Marivaux, Piron, Gresset,\r\nand some others, work which does not require any very great indulgence\r\nto entitle it to the name, in the right sense, of classical;\r\nBeaumarchais, work which is indissolubly connected with great historical\r\nevents, and which is not unworthy the connection. Moreover, as a matter\r\nof general literary history, the drama during this time displays\r\nnumerous evidences of life and promise, as well as of decadence. The\r\ngradual recognition of the vaudeville as a separate literary kind gave\r\noccasion to much work, the ephemeral character of which should not be\r\nallowed to obscure its real literary excellence, and founded a school\r\nwhich is still living and flourishing with by no means simulated life.\r\nThe attempt of La Chaussee and Diderot to widen the range and break down\r\nthe barriers of legitimate drama was premature, and not altogether well\r\ndirected; but it was the forerunner of the great and durable reaction of\r\nnearly a century later. Still the actual dramatic accomplishment of this\r\nperiod, though in many ways interesting, and to a certain extent\r\npositively valuable, is not of the first class. It is made up either of\r\nclever imitations and variations of modes which had already been\r\nexpressed with greater perfection, and with far greater genius, by the\r\npreceding century, or of what may be fairly called dramatic\r\npamphleteering, or else of tentative and immature experiments in reform,\r\nwhich came to nothing, or to very little, for the time being. Even its\r\nmost gifted practitioners regarded it as a kind of journey-work, which\r\nwas understood to lead to honour and profit, rather than as an art, in\r\nwhich honour and profit, if not entirely to be ignored, are altogether\r\nsecondary considerations. Hence, in a lesser degree, the drama of the\r\neighteenth century shares the same disadvantage which has been noted as\r\ncharacterising its poetry. Its value is a value of curiosity chiefly, a\r\nrelative value. Indeed, as a mere mechanical art, drama sank even lower\r\nthan poetry proper ever sank; and for fifty years at least before the\r\nromantic revival it may be doubted whether a single play was written,\r\nthe destruction of which need greatly grieve even the most sensitive and\r\nappreciative student of French literary history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nNOVELISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the eighteenth century in France as regards\r\nliterature----that is to say, the application of great talents to almost\r\nevery branch of literary production without the result of a distinct\r\noriginal growth in any one department----is nowhere more noticeable than\r\nin the department of prose fiction[288]. The names of Lesage, Prevost,\r\nMarivaux, Voltaire, Rousseau, are deservedly recorded among the list of\r\nthe best novel writers. Yet, with the exception of _Manon Lescaut_,\r\nwhich for the time had no imitators, of the great works of Lesage which,\r\nadmirable in execution, were by no means original in conception, and of\r\nthe exquisite but comparatively insignificant variety of the prose\r\n_Conte_, of which Voltaire was the chief practitioner, nothing in the\r\nnature of a masterpiece, still less anything in the nature of an\r\nepoch-making work, was composed. The example of _Manon_ was left for the\r\nnineteenth century to develop, the others either died out (the adventure\r\nromance, after Lesage's model, flourishing brilliantly in England, but\r\nhardly at all in France), or else were subordinated to a purpose, the\r\npurpose of advocating _philosophe_ views, or of pandering to the not\r\nvery healthy cravings of an altogether artificial society. Yet, so far\r\nas merely literary merits are concerned, few branches of literature were\r\nmore fertile than this during the period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lesage.]\r\n\r\nThe first, and on the whole, the most considerable name of the century\r\nin fiction is that of the author of _Gil Blas_. Alain Rene Lesage was\r\nborn at Sarzeau, near Vannes, on the 8th of May, 1668, and died at\r\nBoulogne on the 17th of November, 1747. He was bred a lawyer, and should\r\nhave had a fair competence, but, being early left an orphan, was\r\ndeprived of most of his property by the dishonesty of his guardian. He\r\nmarried young, moreover, and, unlike most of the prominent men of\r\nletters of his day, never seems to have enjoyed any solid patronage or\r\nprotection from any powerful man or woman. This is indeed sufficiently\r\naccounted for by anecdotes which exist showing his extreme independence\r\nof character. Like most men of talent in such circumstances, he turned,\r\nthough not very early, to literature, and began by a translation of the\r\n'Letters' of Aristaenetus. No great success could have awaited him in\r\nthis line, and perhaps the greatest stroke of good-fortune in his life\r\nwas the suggestion of the Abbe de Lyonne that he should turn his\r\nattention to Spanish literature, a suggestion which was not made more\r\nunpalatable by the present of a small annuity. He translated the 'New\r\nDon Quixote' of Avellaneda (than which he might have found a better\r\nsubject), and he adapted freely plays from Rojas, Lope de Vega, and\r\nCalderon. It was not, however, till he was nearly forty that he produced\r\nanything of real merit. The _Diable Boiteux_ appeared in 1707, and was\r\nat once popular. Still Lesage did not desert the stage, and the\r\nproduction of his admirable comedy _Turcaret_ ought to have secured him\r\nsuccess there. But the Comedie Francaise was at that time more under the\r\ninfluence of clique than at any other time of its history; and Lesage,\r\ndisgusted with the treatment he received from it, gave himself up\r\nentirely to writing farces and operettas for the minor theatres, and to\r\nprose fiction. _Gil Blas_, his greatest work, originally appeared in\r\n1715, but was not completed till twenty years later. He also\r\nwrote--besides one or two bright but trifling minor works of a\r\nfictitious character, _La Valise Trouvee_ (a letter-bag supposed to be\r\npicked up), _Une Journee des Parques_, a keen piece of Lucianic satire,\r\netc.--many other romances in the same general style as his great works,\r\nand more or less borrowed from Spanish originals. The chief of these are\r\n_Guzman d'Alfarache_, _Estevanille Gonzalez_, _Le Bachelier de\r\nSalamanque_, and a curious Defoe-like book entitled _Vie et Aventures de\r\nM. de Beauchene_. In his old age he retired to the house of his second\r\nson, who held a canonry at Boulogne, and resided there for some years,\r\nuntil, in 1747, he died in his eightieth year. His works have hitherto\r\nbeen very insufficiently collected and edited.\r\n\r\n_Le Diable Boiteux_ and _Gil Blas_ are far the greatest of Lesage's\r\nromances, and, as it happens, they are the most original, little except\r\nthe starting-point being borrowed in the one case, and nothing but a few\r\ndetached details in the other. Lesage was, however, true to the general\r\nspirit of his model, the picaroon romance of Spain, a kind of Roman\r\nd'Aventures transported from the days and conventional conditions of\r\nchivalry to those of ordinary but still adventurous life in the\r\nPeninsula. The directly satirical intention predominates in the _Diable\r\nBoiteux_, the more purely narrative faculty in _Gil Blas_. In both the\r\npiercing observation of human character, which Lesage possessed in a\r\ngreater degree perhaps than any other French writer, appears, and so\r\ndoes his remarkable power of making the results of this observation live\r\nand move. No French writer is so little of a mere Frenchman as Lesage,\r\nand in this point of cosmopolitan humanity he may be compared, without\r\nextravagance, in kind if not in degree, to Shakespeare. Besides his\r\nskill in character-drawing, and his faculty of spicing his narrative\r\nwith epigram, Lesage also possessed extraordinary narrative ability. His\r\nbooks are not remarkable for what is called plot, that is to say, the\r\naction rather continues indefinitely in a straight line than converges\r\non a given and definite point. But this continuance is so adroitly\r\nmanaged that no break is felt, and the succession very seldom becomes\r\ntedious. The novel of Lesage is the immediate parent and pattern of that\r\nof Fielding and Smollett in England. It is somewhat remarkable that it\r\nhad no successors of importance or merit in France. This is probably to\r\nbe accounted for by the cosmopolitan tone which has been already\r\nremarked upon. Indeed Lesage, as a rule, has had less justice done to\r\nhim by his countrymen than any other of their great writers. Yet his\r\nstyle, looked at merely from the point of view of art, is excellent, and\r\nperhaps superior to that of any of his contemporaries properly so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nClose in the track of Madame de la Fayette followed Madame de Fontaines\r\n(Marie Louise Charlotte de Givri), the date of whose birth is unknown,\r\nbut who died in 1730. She was a friend of Voltaire's youth, and her best\r\nwork is named _La Comtesse de Savoie_, the date of the story being the\r\neleventh century. She also wrote a short story of less merit called\r\n_Amenophis_. Madame de Tencin (Claudine Alexandrine Guerin), the mother\r\nof D'Alembert, the friend of Fontenelle, and one of the most famous\r\nsalon-holders of the early eighteenth century, was a more fertile and a\r\ncleverer writer. She was born in 1681, and died in 1749. She had a bad\r\nheart, but an excellent head, and she showed her powers in the _Memoires\r\ndu Comte de Comminges_ and the _Siege de Calais_, besides some minor\r\nworks. The fault of almost all romances of the La Fayette school, the\r\nhabit of throwing the scene into periods about which the writers knew\r\nnothing, appears in these works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marivaux.]\r\n\r\nBut the first writer of fiction after Lesage who is worthy of separate\r\nmention at any length (for in these later centuries of our history there\r\nare, as any reader of books will understand, vast numbers of\r\npractitioners in every branch of literary art who are entirely unworthy\r\nof notice in a compendious history of literature) is Marivaux, an\r\noriginal and remarkable novelist, who, though by no possibility to be\r\nranked among the great names of French literature, occupies a not\r\ninconsiderable place among those who are remarkable without being great.\r\nPierre Carlet de Marivaux, whose strict paternal appellation was simply\r\nPierre Carlet, was born at Paris on the 8th of February, 1688. His\r\nfather was of Norman origin, and held employments in the financial\r\nbranch of the public service. Very little is known of the son's youth,\r\nand indeed not much of his life. He is said to have produced his first\r\nplay, _Le Pere Prudent et Equitable_, at the age of eighteen, and his\r\ndramatic industry was thenceforward considerable. As a romancer he\r\nworked more by fits and starts. His first attempt at prose fiction is\r\nsaid to have been--for the authenticity of the attribution is not\r\ncertain--a romance in a kind of pseudo-Spanish style, called _Les Effets\r\nsurprenants de la Sympathie_, published six years later. Then he took to\r\nthe sterile and ignoble literature of travesty, attacking Homer and\r\nFenelon in the style of Scarron and Cotton. This brought him, through La\r\nMotte, under the influence of Fontenelle, to whom he owed not a little.\r\nHe made a fortune and lost it in Law's bubble. Then he turned\r\njournalist, and after writing social articles in the _Mercure_, started\r\na periodical himself, the nature of which is sufficiently shown by its\r\nborrowed title, _Le Spectateur Francais_, 1722. At a later period he\r\nbegan another paper of the same kind, _Le Cabinet du Philosophe_, 1734.\r\nHis plays, which have been already noticed, were written partly for the\r\nComedie Francaise, and partly for a very popular Italian company which\r\nappeared in France during the second quarter of the century. But for the\r\npresent purpose his works which concern us are the famous romance of\r\n_Marianne_, 1731-1742, and the less-known one of the _Paysan Parvenu_,\r\n1735. His dramas, rather than his fictions, procured him a place in the\r\nAcademy in 1742, and he died in 1763.\r\n\r\n_Marianne_ has been said to be the origin of _Pamela_, which may not be\r\nexactly the fact, though it is difficult not to believe that it gave\r\nRichardson his idea. But it is certain that it is a remarkable novel,\r\nand that it, rather than the plays, gave rise to the singular phrase\r\n_Marivaudage_, with which the author, not at all voluntarily, has\r\nenriched literature. The plot is simple enough. A poor but virtuous girl\r\nhas adventures and recounts them, and the manner of recounting is\r\nextremely original. A morally faulty but intellectually admirable\r\ncontemporary, Crebillon the younger, described this manner excellently\r\nby saying that the characters not only say everything that they have\r\ndone and everything that they have thought, but everything that they\r\nwould have liked to think but did not. This curious kind of mental\r\nanalysis is expressed in a style which cannot be defended from the\r\ncharge of affectation notwithstanding its extreme ingenuity and\r\noccasional wit. The real importance of _Marianne_ in the history of\r\nfiction is that it is the first example of the novel of analysis rather\r\nthan of incident (though incident is still prominent), and the first in\r\nwhich an elaborate style, strongly imbued with mannerism, is applied to\r\nthis purpose. The _Paysan Parvenu_, the title of which suggested\r\nRestif's novel _Le Paysan Perverti_, and which was probably not without\r\ninfluence on _Joseph Andrews_, is not very different in manner from\r\n_Marianne_, and, like it, was left unfinished after publication in parts\r\nat long intervals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prevost]\r\n\r\nA third eminent writer of novels was, in point of production, a\r\ncontemporary of Lesage and Marivaux, though he was nearly thirty years\r\nyounger than the first, and fully ten years younger than the second, and\r\nhe more than either of them set the example of the modern novel. The\r\nAbbe Prevost, sometimes called Prevost d'Exilles, was born at Hesdin, in\r\nPicardy, in April, 1697. He was brought up by the Jesuits, and after a\r\ncurious hesitation between entering the order and becoming a soldier (he\r\nactually served for some time) he joined the famous community of the\r\nBenedictines of Saint Maur, the most learned monastic body in the Roman\r\nchurch. When he did this he was four-and-twenty, and he continued for\r\nsome six years to give himself up to study, not without interludes of\r\nprofessorial work and of preaching. He became, however, disgusted with\r\nhis order, and unfortunately left his convent before technical\r\npermission had been given; a proceeding which kept him an exile from\r\nFrance for several years. It was at this time (1728) that he threw\r\nhimself into novel-writing, taking his models, and in some cases, his\r\nscenes and characters, from England, which he visited, and of which he\r\nwas a fervent admirer. He obtained permission to return in 1735, and\r\nthen started a paper called _Le Pour et le Contre_, something like those\r\nof Marivaux, but more like a modern critical review. He received the\r\nprotection of several persons of position and influence, notably the\r\nPrince de Conti and the Chancellor D'Aguesseau, and for nearly thirty\r\nyears led a laborious literary life, in the course of which he is said\r\nto have written nearly a hundred volumes, mostly compilations. His\r\ndeath, which occurred in November, 1763, was perhaps the most horrible\r\nin literary history. He was on his way from Paris to his cottage near\r\nChantilly, when he was struck by apoplexy. A stupid village doctor took\r\nhim for dead, and began a post-mortem examination to discover the cause.\r\nPrevost revived at the stroke of the knife, but was so injured by it\r\nthat he expired shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nHis chief works of fiction are the _Memoires d'un Homme de Qualite_,\r\n1729, _Cleveland_, and the _Doyen de Killerine_, 1735, romances of\r\nadventure occupying a middle place between those of Lesage and Marivaux.\r\nBut he would have been long forgotten had it not been for an episode or\r\nrather postscript of the _Memoires_ entitled _Manon Lescaut_, in which\r\nall competent criticism recognises the first masterpiece of French\r\nliterature which can properly be called a novel. Manon is a young girl\r\nwith whom the Chevalier des Grieux, almost as young as herself, falls\r\nfrantically in love. The pair fly to Paris, and the novel is occupied\r\nwith the description of Manon's faithlessness--a faithlessness based not\r\non want of love for Des Grieux, but on an overmastering desire for\r\nluxury and comfort with which he cannot always supply her. The story,\r\nwhich is narrated by Des Grieux, and which has a most pathetic ending,\r\nis chiefly remarkable for the perfect simplicity and absolute\r\nlife-likeness of the character-drawing. The despairing constancy of Des\r\nGrieux, conscious of the vileness of his idol, yet unable to help loving\r\nher, the sober goodness of his friend Tiberge, the roystering villany of\r\nManon's brother Lescaut, and, above all, the surprising and novel, but\r\nstrictly practical and reasonable, figure of Manon, who, in her way,\r\nloves Des Grieux, who has no objection to deceive her richer lovers for\r\nhim, but whose first craving is for material well-being and\r\nprosperity--make up a gallery which has rarely been exceeded in power\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\nA novelist of merit, slightly junior to these, was Madame Riccoboni\r\n(Marie Jeanne Laboras de Mezieres), who was born in 1713, married an\r\nactor and dramatic author of little talent, and died at a great age in\r\n1792. Her best works of fiction are _Le Marquis de Cressy_, _Mylady\r\nCatesby_, and _Ernestine_, with an exceedingly clever continuation\r\n(which, however, stops short of the conclusion) of Marivaux'\r\n_Marianne_. All these books are constructed with considerable skill, and\r\nare good examples of what may be called the sentimental romance. Duclos,\r\nbetter known now for his historical and historical-ethical work, was\r\nalso a novel-writer at this period. The _Lettres du Marquis de Roselle_,\r\nof Madame Elie de Beaumont, rather resembles the work of Madame\r\nRiccoboni.\r\n\r\nThe works of the three principal writers who have just been discussed\r\nbelong to the first half of the century, and do not exhibit those\r\ncharacteristics by which it is most generally known. Marivaux is indeed\r\nan important representative of the laborious gallantry which descended\r\nfrom the days of the _precieuses_--Fontenelle being a link between the\r\ntwo ages--and Prevost exhibits, in at least its earlier stage, the\r\nsensibility which was one of the great characteristics of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. But neither of them can in the least be called a _philosophe_.\r\nOn the other hand, the _philosophe_ movement, which dominated the middle\r\nand latter portions of the age, was not long in invading the department\r\nof fiction. Each of the three celebrated men who stood at its head\r\ndevoted himself to the novel in one or other of its forms; while\r\nMontesquieu, in the _Lettres Persanes_, came near to it, and each of the\r\ntrio themselves had more or fewer followers in fiction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Voltaire.]\r\n\r\nNo long work of prose fiction stands under the name of Voltaire, but it\r\nmay be doubted whether any of his works displays his peculiar genius\r\nmore fully and more characteristically than the short tales in prose\r\nwhich he has left. Every one of them has a moral, political, social, or\r\ntheological purpose. _Zadig_, 1748, is, perhaps, in its general aim,\r\nrather philosophical in the proper sense; _Babouc_, 1746, social;\r\n_Memnon_, 1747, ethical. _Micromegas_, 1752, is a satire on certain\r\nforms of science; the group of smaller tales, such as _Le Taureau\r\nBlanc_, are theological or rather anti-theological. _L'Ingenu_, 1767,\r\nand _L'Homme aux Quarante Ecus_ (same date), are political from\r\ndifferent points of view. All these objects meet and unite in the most\r\nfamous and most daring of all, _Candide_, 1758. Written ostensibly to\r\nridicule philosophical optimism, and on the spur given to pessimist\r\ntheories by the Lisbon earthquake, _Candide_ is really as comprehensive\r\nas it is desultory. Religion, political government, national\r\npeculiarities, human weakness, ambition, love, loyalty, all come in for\r\nthe unfailing sneer. The moral, wherever there is a moral, is, 'be\r\ntolerant, and _cultivez votre jardin_,' that is to say, do whatsoever\r\nwork you have to do diligently. But in all these tales the destructive\r\nelement has a good deal the better of the constructive. As literature,\r\nhowever, they are almost invariably admirable. There is probably no\r\nsingle book in existence which contains so much wit, pure and simple, as\r\nthe moderate sized octavo in which are comprised these two or three\r\ndozen short stories, none of which exceeds a hundred pages or so in\r\nlength, while many do not extend beyond two or three. Nowhere is the\r\ncapacity of the French language for _persiflage_ better shown, and\r\nnowhere, perhaps, are more phrases which have become household words to\r\nbe found. Nowhere also, it is true, is the utter want of reverence,\r\nwhich was Voltaire's greatest fault, and the absence of profundity,\r\nwhich accompanied his marvellous superficial range and acuteness, more\r\nconstantly displayed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diderot.]\r\n\r\nNo inconsiderable portion of the extensive and unequal work of Diderot\r\nis occupied by prose fiction. He began by a licentious tale in the\r\nmanner, but without the wit, of Crebillon the younger; a tale in which,\r\nsave a little social satire, there was no purpose whatever. But by\r\ndegrees he, like Voltaire, began to use the novel as a polemical weapon.\r\nThe powerful story of _La Religieuse_, 1760, was the boldest attack\r\nwhich, since the Reformation and the licence of Latin writing, had been\r\nmade on the drawbacks and dangers of conventual life. _Jacques le\r\nFataliste_, 1766, is a curious book, partly suggested, no doubt, by\r\nSterne, but having a legitimate French ancestry in the _fatrasie_ of the\r\nsixteenth century. Jacques is a manservant who travels with his master,\r\nhas adventures with him, talks incessantly to him, and tells him\r\nstories, as also does another character, the mistress of a country inn.\r\nOne of these stories, the history of the jealousy and attempted revenge\r\nof a great lady on her faithless lover by making him fall in love with a\r\ngirl of no character, is admirably told, and has often since been\r\nadapted in fiction and drama. Other episodes of _Jacques le Fataliste_\r\nare good, but the whole is unequal. The strangest of all Diderot's\r\nattempts in prose fiction--if it is to be called a fiction and not a\r\ndramatic study--is the so-called _Neveu de Rameau_, in which, in the\r\nguise of a dialogue between himself and a hanger-on of society (or\r\nrather a monologue of the latter), the follies and vices, not merely of\r\nthe time, but of human nature itself, are exposed with a masterly hand,\r\nand in a manner wonderfully original and piquant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rousseau.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crebillon the Younger.]\r\n\r\nNeither Voltaire, however, nor Diderot devoted, in proportion to their\r\nother work, as much attention to prose fiction as did Jean Jacques\r\nRousseau. Even the _Confessions_ might be classed under this head\r\nwithout a great violation of propriety, and Rousseau's only other large\r\nbooks, _La Nouvelle Heloise_, 1760, and _Emile_, 1764, are avowed\r\nnovels. In both of these the didactic purpose asserts itself. In the\r\nlatter, indeed, it asserts itself to a degree sufficient seriously to\r\nimpair the literary merit of the story. The second title of _Emile_ is\r\n_L'Education_, and it is devoted to the unfolding of Rousseau's views on\r\nthat subject by the aid of an actual example in Emile the hero. It had a\r\ngreat vogue and a very considerable practical influence, nor can the\r\nrace of novels with political or ethical purposes be said to have ever\r\ndied out since. As a novel, properly so called, it has but little merit.\r\nThe case is different with _Julie_ or _La Nouvelle Heloise_. This is a\r\nstory told chiefly in the form of letters, and recounting the love of a\r\nnoble young lady, Julie, for Saint Preux, a man of low rank, with a kind\r\nof afterpiece, depicting Julie's married life with a respectable but\r\nprosaic free-thinker, M. de Wolmar. This famous book set the example,\r\nfirst, of the novel of sentiment, secondly, of the novel of landscape\r\npainting. Many efforts have been made to dethrone Rousseau from his\r\nposition of teacher of Europe in point of sentiment and the picturesque,\r\nbut they have had no real success. It is to _La Nouvelle Heloise_ that\r\nboth sentimental and picturesque fictions fairly owe their original\r\npopularity; yet _Julie_ cannot be called a good novel. Its direct\r\nnarrative interest is but small, its characters are too intensely drawn\r\nor else too merely conventional, its plot far too meagre. It is in\r\nisolated passages of description, and in the fervent passion which\r\npervades parts of it, that its value, and at the same time its\r\nimportance in the history of novel-writing, consist.\r\n\r\nSome lesser names group themselves naturally round those of the greater\r\n_Philosophes_ in the department of prose fiction. Voltaire's style was\r\nlargely followed, but scarcely from Voltaire's point of view, and those\r\nwho practised it fell rather under the head of _Conteurs_ pure and\r\nsimple than of novelists with a purpose. The prose _Conte_ of the\r\neighteenth century forms a remarkable branch of literature, redeemed\r\nfrom triviality by the exceptional skill expended on it. The master of\r\nthe style was Crebillon the younger, in whom its merits and defects were\r\nboth eminently present. Son of the tragic author, Crebillon led an easy\r\nbut a rather mysterious life, married an Englishwoman, and was supposed\r\nby his friends to be dead long before he had actually quitted this\r\nworld. His works, of which it is unnecessary to mention the names here,\r\nexhibit the moral corruption of the times in almost the highest possible\r\ndegree. But they abound in keen social satire, in acute literary\r\ncriticism, and in verbal wit. What is more, they show an extraordinary\r\nmastery of the art of narrative of the lighter kind. Around Crebillon\r\nare grouped a large number of writers, some of whom almost rival him in\r\ndelicate literary knack, and most of whom equal him in perverse\r\nimmorality of subject and tone. Much of the formal exercise of this tale\r\nliterature was a tradition from the slightly earlier school of fairy\r\ntale-writing, which has already been noticed. Voisenon, Caylus,\r\nBoufflers, Moncrif (the most original and most eccentric of all), La\r\nMorliere, are names of this class. Their prose may, on the analogy of\r\nVers de Societe, be called Prose de Societe, and of a very corrupt\r\nsociety too. But its formal excellence is considerable.\r\n\r\nOf exceptional excellence among the short tales of this time, and free\r\nfrom their drawbacks, is the _Diable Amoureux_, 1772, of Cazotte, a\r\nsingular person, strongly tinged with the 'illuminism,' or belief in\r\noccult sciences and arts, which was a natural result of the _philosophe_\r\nmovement. Cazotte's melancholy story has a place in all histories of the\r\nFrench Revolution, and his name was (probably) borrowed by La Harpe for\r\na bold and striking apologue, the authenticity or spuriousness of which\r\nis very much a matter of guess-work. The _Diable Amoureux_ is a\r\nsingularly powerful story of its kind, uniting, in the fashion so\r\ndifficult with tales of _diablerie_, literary verisimilitude and\r\nexactness of presentation with strangeness of subject.\r\n\r\nVoltaire's chief pupils and followers, while taking his own view of the\r\nutility of the prose tale for controversial purposes, followed another\r\nmodel for the most part in point of form. The immense influence of\r\n_Telemaque_ was felt by Voltaire himself, though in his case it resulted\r\nin history pure and simple. Marmontel in his _Belisaire_, and Florian in\r\nhis _Numa Pompilius_ and _Gonsalve de Cordoue_, returned to the\r\nhistorical romance. Something of the same class, though based upon much\r\nmore solid scholarship, was the _Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis_ of the Abbe\r\nBarthelemy. All these books, like their predecessor, have somewhat\r\npassed out of the range of literature proper into that of school books.\r\nThey are, however, all good examples of the easy, correct, and lucid, if\r\ncold and conventional, tongue of the later eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bernardin de Saint-Pierre.]\r\n\r\nRousseau had a far more important disciple in fiction. Jacques Henri\r\nBernardin de Saint-Pierre was born at Havre in 1737. He was by\r\nprofession an engineer, and both professionally and on his private\r\naccount wandered about the world in a curious fashion. At last he met\r\nRousseau, and the influence of Jean Jacques developed the sentimental\r\nmorality, the speculative republicanism, and the ardent, if rather\r\naffected, love of nature which had already distinguished him. His best\r\nbook, _Paul et Virginie_, is perhaps the only one of his works which can\r\nproperly be called a novel; but _La Chaumiere Indienne_ deserves to be\r\nclassed with it, and even the _Etudes de la Nature_ are half fiction.\r\n_Paul et Virginie_ was written when the author's admiration of nature\r\nand of the savage state, imbibed from Rousseau or quickened by his\r\nsociety, had been further inflamed by a three years' residence in\r\nMauritius. Like the books mentioned in the last paragraph, _Paul et\r\nVirginie_ has lost something by becoming a school-book, but its faults\r\nand merits are in a literary sense greater than theirs. The over-ripe\r\nsentiment and the false delicacy of it will always remain evidence of\r\nthe stimulating but unhealthy atmosphere in which it was written. But it\r\ncannot be denied that, both here and elsewhere in Bernardin de\r\nSaint-Pierre, there is a very remarkable faculty of word-painting, and\r\nalso of influencing the feelings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Restif de la Bretonne.]\r\n\r\nThe later eighteenth century saw a vast number of novelists and novels,\r\nfew of which were of much literary value, while most of them displayed\r\nthe evil influences of the time in more ways than one. Dulaurens, a\r\nvagabond and disreputable writer, is chiefly remembered for his _Compere\r\nMathieu_, a book presenting some points of likeness to _Jacques le\r\nFataliste_, and like it inspired partly by Sterne, and partly by\r\nSterne's master, Rabelais. Writers like Louvet and La Clos continued the\r\nworst part of Crebillon's tradition without exhibiting either his\r\nliterary skill or his wit. A much more remarkable name is that of Restif\r\nde la Bretonne, who has been called, and not without reason, the French\r\nDefoe. He was born at Sacy in Burgundy in 1734, and died at Paris in\r\n1806. Although of very humble birth, he seems to have acquired an\r\nirregular but considerable education, and, establishing himself early in\r\nParis, he became an indefatigable author. About fifty separate works of\r\nhis exist, some of which are of great extent, and one of which, _Les\r\nContemporaines_, includes forty-two volumes and nearly three hundred\r\nseparate articles or tales. Restif, whose entire sanity may reasonably\r\nbe doubted, was a novelist, a philosopher, a social innovator, a\r\ndiligent observer of the manners of his times, a spelling reformer. His\r\nwork is for the most part destitute of the most rudimentary notions of\r\ndecency, but it is apparently produced in good faith and with no evil\r\npurpose. His portraiture of manners is remarkably vivid. It is in this,\r\nin his earnest but eccentric philanthropy, and in his grasp of\r\ncharacter, not seldom vigorous and close, that he chiefly resembles\r\nDefoe. He has been called in France the Rousseau of the gutter, which\r\nalso is a comparison not without truth and instruction, despite the\r\njingle ('Rousseau du ruisseau') by which it was no doubt suggested.\r\n\r\nThe law which seems to have ordained that, though the eighteenth century\r\nin France should produce no masterpiece in fictitious literature, or\r\nonly one, all the most distinguished literary names should be connected\r\nwith fiction, extended to the long and, in a literary sense, dreary\r\ndebateable land between the eighteenth century itself and the\r\nnineteenth. Of this period the two dominant names are beyond question\r\nthose of Chateaubriand and of Madame de Stael. Both attempted various\r\nkinds of writing, but some of the most important work of both comes\r\nunder the heading of the present chapter, and both as literary figures\r\nare best treated here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chateaubriand.]\r\n\r\nFrancois Auguste de Chateaubriand was born at Saint Malo, where he is\r\nnow buried, in 1768, and died in 1848. He belonged to a family which was\r\namong the noblest of Britanny and of France, but which was not wealthy,\r\nand he was a younger son. Intended at first for the navy, he was\r\nallowed, at the outbreak of the Revolution, to indulge his fancy for\r\ntravelling, and journeyed to North America. There he learnt the\r\nanti-monarchical turn which things had taken in France. He at once\r\nreturned and joined the emigrants at Coblentz. He was seriously wounded\r\nat the siege of Thionville, and had some difficulty in making his way,\r\nby Holland and Jersey, to England, where he lived in great poverty.\r\nChateaubriand's acceptance of the Legitimist side had been but\r\nhalf-hearted, and his first published work, _Sur les Revolutions\r\nAnciennes et Modernes_, still expresses the peculiar liberalism\r\nwhich--it is sometimes forgotten--was much more deeply rooted in the\r\nFrench noblesse of the eighteenth century than in any other class. This\r\nopened the way to his return at the time that Napoleon, then entering on\r\nthe consulate, endeavoured, by all the means in his power, to conciliate\r\nthe emigrants. The _Genie du Christianisme_, which had been preceded by\r\n_Atala_ (a kind of specimen of it), was his first original, and his most\r\ncharacteristic, work. This curious book, which it is impossible to\r\nanalyse, consists partly of a rather desultory apology for Christian\r\ndoctrine, partly of a series of historical illustrations of Christian\r\nlife: it appeared in 1802. It suited the policy of Napoleon, who made\r\nChateaubriand, first, secretary to the Roman Embassy, and then\r\nambassador to the Valais. But Chateaubriand had never given up his\r\nlegitimism, and the murder of the Duke d'Enghien shocked him\r\nirresistibly. He at once resigned his post, and thenceforward was in\r\nmore or less covert opposition, though he was not actually banished from\r\nFrance. Pursuing the vein which he had opened in the _Genie_, he made a\r\njourney to the East, the result of which was his _Itineraire de Paris a\r\nJerusalem_, and the unequal but remarkable prose epic of _Les Martyrs_.\r\nThis, the story of which is laid in the time of Diocletian, shifts its\r\nscene from classical countries to Gaul, where the half-mythical heroes\r\nof the Franks appear, and then back to Greece, Rome, and Purgatory. The\r\nfall of Napoleon opened once more a political career, of which\r\nChateaubriand had always been ardently desirous. His pamphlet, _De\r\nBonaparte et des Bourbons_, was, perhaps, the most important literary\r\ncontribution to the re-establishment of the ancient monarchy. During the\r\nfifteen years which elapsed between the battle of Waterloo and the\r\nRevolution of July, Chateaubriand underwent vicissitudes due to the\r\ndifficulty of adjusting his liberalism and his legitimism, sentiments\r\nwhich seem both to have been genuine, but to have been quite\r\nunreconciled by any reasoning process on the part of their holder. Yet,\r\nthough he had again and again experienced the most ungracious treatment\r\nboth from Louis XVIII. and Charles X., the July monarchy had no sooner\r\nestablished itself than he resigned his positions and pensions, and took\r\nno further official part in political affairs during the rest of his\r\nlife. In his latter days he was much with the celebrated Madame\r\nRecamier, and completed his affectedly-named but admirable _Memoires\r\nd'Outre Tombe_,--an autobiography which, though marred by some of his\r\npeculiarities, contains much of his most brilliant writing. Of the works\r\nnot hitherto noticed, _Rene_, _Le Dernier Abencerage_, _Les Natchez_,\r\nand some sketches of travels and of French history, are the most\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nFor some thirty years, from 1810 to 1840, Chateaubriand was\r\nunquestionably the greatest man of letters of France in the estimation\r\nof his contemporaries. His fame has since then diminished considerably,\r\nand much has been written to account for the change. It is not, however,\r\nvery difficult to understand it. Chateaubriand is one of the chief\r\nrepresentatives in literature of the working of two conditions, which,\r\nwhile they lend for the time much adventitious importance to the man who\r\ntakes full advantage of them, invariably lead to rapidly-diminished\r\nestimates of him when they have ceased to work. He was a representative\r\nat once of transition and reaction--of transition from the hard and\r\nfast classical standards of the eighteenth century to the principles of\r\nthe romantic and eclectic schools, of reaction against the _philosophe_\r\nera. He was one of the earliest and most influential exponents of the\r\nso-called _maladie du siecle_, of what, from his most illustrious pupil,\r\nis generally called Byronism. His immediate literary teachers were\r\nRousseau and Ossian. He was not a thoroughly well-educated man, and he\r\nwas exceptionally deficient in the purely logical and analytic faculty\r\nas distinguished from the rhetorical and synthetic. What he could do and\r\ndid, was to glorify Christianity and monarchism in a series of\r\nbrilliantly-coloured pictures, which had an immense effect on an age\r\naccustomed to the grey tints and monotonous argument of the opposite\r\nschool, but which, to a posterity which is placed at a different point\r\nof view, seem to lack accuracy of detail and sincerity of emotion.\r\nNevertheless Chateaubriand, if not a very great man, was a very great\r\nman of letters. His best passages are not easily to be surpassed in\r\nbrilliancy of style and vividness of colouring. If the sentiment of his\r\n_Rene_ seems hollow now-a-days, it must be remembered that this is\r\nalmost entirely a matter of fashion and of novelty. The _Genie du\r\nChristianisme_, despite many defects of taste, more of insight, and most\r\nof mere learning, remains one of the most eloquent pleadings in\r\nliterature, and not one of the least effective; while the _Itineraire_\r\nis the pattern of all the picturesque travels of modern times. All these\r\nworks, and most of the rest, are practically novels with a purpose. Even\r\nin the autobiography the historic part is entirely subdued and moulded\r\nto the exigencies of the dramatic and narrative construction. Regarded\r\nmerely as an individual writer, Chateaubriand would supply a volume of\r\n'Beauties' hardly inferior to that which could be gathered from any\r\nother prose author in France. Regarded as a precursor, he deserves far\r\nmore than any other single man, and almost more than all others put\r\ntogether, the title of father of the Romantic movement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Stael.]\r\n\r\nHis chief rival in the literature of the empire was also essentially,\r\nthough not wholly or professedly, a novelist. Anne Louise Germaine\r\nNecker, who married a Swedish diplomatist, the Baron de Stael Holstein,\r\nand is, therefore, generally known as Madame de Stael, was the daughter\r\nof the great financier Necker, and of Susanne Curchod, Gibbon's early\r\nlove. She was introduced young to salon life in Paris, and early\r\ndisplayed ungovernable vanity, and much of the _sensibilite_ of the\r\ntime, that is to say, an indulgence in sentiment which paid equally\r\nlittle heed to morality and to good sense. Her marriage was one purely\r\nof convenience: and while her husband, of whom she seems to have had no\r\nreason whatever to complain, obtained some wealth by it, she herself\r\nsecured a very agreeable position, inasmuch as the king of Sweden\r\npledged himself either to maintain M. de Stael in the Swedish embassy at\r\nParis, or to provide for him in other ways. She approved the early\r\nstages of the Revolution, but was shocked at the deposition and death of\r\nthe king and queen. Whereupon she fled the country. Before she was\r\nthirty she had written various books, _Lettres sur J. J. Rousseau_,\r\n_Defense de la Reine_, _De l'Influence des Passions_, and other pieces\r\nof many kinds. When the influence of Napoleon became paramount, Madame\r\nde Stael, who had returned to Paris, found herself in an awkward\r\nposition, for she was equally determined to say what she chose, and to\r\nhave gallant attentions paid to her, and Napoleon would not comply with\r\neither of her wishes. She, therefore, had to leave France, but not\r\nbefore she had published her first romance, _Delphine_, and a book on\r\nliterature. She now travelled for some years in Germany and Italy in the\r\ncompany of Benjamin Constant, who was the object of one of her numerous\r\naccesses of affection. _Corinne_, her principal novel, and her greatest\r\nwork but one, appeared in 1807, her book _De l'Allemagne_ being\r\nsuppressed in Paris, whither she had returned, but which she soon had to\r\nleave again. The Restoration gave her access once more to France, and\r\nenabled her to resume possession of property which had been unjustly\r\nseized, but she died not long afterwards, in 1817. Her _Dix Annees\r\nd'Exil_ and her _Considerations sur la Revolution Francaise_ were\r\npublished posthumously, the latter being one of her chief works. She had\r\nmarried secretly, in 1812, a M. de Rocca, a man more than young enough\r\nto be her son.\r\n\r\nThe personality of Madame de Stael is far from being attractive owing to\r\nher excessive vanity, which disgusted all her contemporaries, and the\r\nfolly which made a woman, who had never been beautiful, continue, long\r\nafter she had ceased to be young, to give herself in life and literature\r\nthe airs of a newest Heloise. But she is a very important figure in\r\nFrench literature. Part of her influence, as represented by the book _De\r\nl'Allemagne,_ does not directly concern us in this chapter; this part\r\nwas mainly, but not wholly, literary. It was helped and continued,\r\nhowever, by her other works, especially by her novels, and, above all,\r\nby _Corinne_. This influence, put briefly, was to break up the\r\nnarrowness of French notions on all subjects, and to open it to fresh\r\nideas. Her political and general works led the way to the nineteenth\r\ncentury, side by side with Chateaubriand's, but in an entirely different\r\nsense. What Chateaubriand inculcated was the sense of the beauty of\r\nolder and simpler times, countries, and faiths which the\r\nself-satisfaction of the eighteenth century had obscured; what Madame de\r\nStael had to impress were general ideas of liberalism and progress to\r\nwhich the same century, in its crusade against superstition and its\r\nrather short-sighted belief in its own enlightenment, was equally blind.\r\n_Delphine_, which is in the main a romance of French society only,\r\nwritten before the author had seen much of any other world except a\r\nclose circle of French emigrants abroad, exhibits this tendency much\r\nless than _Corinne_, which was written after that German visit--by far\r\nthe most important event of Madame de Stael's life. Here, as Rousseau\r\nhad inculcated the story of nature and savage life, as Chateaubriand\r\nwas, at the same time, inculcating the study of Christian antiquity and\r\nthe middle ages, so Madame de Stael inculcated the cultivation of\r\naesthetic emotions and impulses as a new influence to be brought to bear\r\non life. Her style, though not to be spoken of disrespectfully, is, on\r\nthe whole, inferior to her matter. It is full of the drawbacks of\r\neighteenth-century _eloges_ and academic discourses, now tawdry, now\r\ndeficient in colour, flexibility, and life, at one time below the\r\nsubject, at another puffed up with commonplace and insincere\r\ndeclamation. Yet when she understood a subject, which was by no means\r\ninvariably the case, Madame de Stael was an excellent exponent; and when\r\nher feelings were sincere, which they sometimes were, she was a fair\r\nmistress of pathos.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of names of writers of fiction during the later\r\nrepublic and the empire have a traditional place in the history of\r\nliterature, and some of their works are still read, but chiefly as\r\nschool-books. Madame de Genlis, the author of _Les Veillees du Chateau_,\r\nand also of many volumes of ill-natured, and not too accurate, memoirs\r\nand reminiscences, continued the moral tale of the eighteenth century,\r\nand in _Mlle. de Clermont_ produced work of merit. Fievee, a journalist\r\nand critic of some talent, is remembered for the pretty story of the\r\n_Dot de Suzette_. Madame de Souza, in her _Adele de Senanges_ and other\r\nworks, revived, to a certain extent, the style of Madame de la Fayette.\r\n_Ourika_ and _Edouard_, especially the latter, preserve the name of\r\nMadame de Duras. Madame Cottin, in _Malek Adel_, _Elizabeth_ or _Les\r\nExiles de Siberie_, etc., combined a mild flavour of romance with\r\nirreproachable moral sentiments. A vigorous continuator of the\r\nlicentious style of novel, with hardly any of the literary refinement of\r\nits eighteenth-century contributors, but with more fertility of incident\r\nand fancy, was Pigault Lebrun, the forerunner of Paul de Kock. Madame de\r\nKrudener, a woman of remarkable history, produced a good novel of\r\nsentiment in _Valerie_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Xavier de Maistre.]\r\n\r\nTwo novelists, singularly different in idiosyncrasy, complete what may\r\nbe called the eighteenth-century school. Xavier de Maistre, younger\r\nbrother of the great Catholic polemist, Joseph de Maistre, was born at\r\nChambery, in 1763. He served in the Piedmontese army during his youth,\r\nand his most famous work, the _Voyage autour de ma Chambre_, was\r\npublished in 1794. The national extinction of Savoy and Piedmont, at\r\nleast the annexation of Savoy and the effacement of Piedmont, made\r\nXavier de Maistre an exile. He joined his brother in St. Petersburg,\r\nserved in the Russian army, fought, and was wounded in the Caucasus;\r\nattained the rank of general, and died at St. Petersburg, in 1852, at\r\nthe great age of eighty-nine. His work consists of the _Voyage_, an\r\naccount of a temporary imprisonment in his quarters at Turin, obviously\r\nsuggested by Sterne, but exceedingly original in execution; _Le Lepreux\r\nde la Cite d'Aoste,_ in which the same inspiration and the same\r\nindependent use of it are noticeable; and _Les Prisonniers du Caucase_,\r\na vivid narrative rather in the manner of the nineteenth than of the\r\neighteenth century, with a continuation of the _Voyage_ called\r\n_Expedition Nocturne_, which has not escaped the usual fate of\r\ncontinuations, and a short version of the touching story of Prascovia,\r\nwhich contrasts very curiously with Madame Cottin's more artificial\r\nhandling of the same subject. The important point about Xavier de\r\nMaistre is that he unites the sentimentality of the eighteenth century,\r\nand not a little of its _Marivaudage_, with an exactness of observation,\r\na general truth of description, and a sense of narrative art which\r\nbelong rather to the nineteenth. Although he was not a Frenchman, his\r\nstyle has always been regarded as a model of French; and the great\r\nauthority of Sainte Beuve justly places him and Merimee side by side as\r\nthe most perfect tellers of tales in the simple fashion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Benjamin Constant.]\r\n\r\nBenjamin Constant's _Adolphe_, 1815, is a very different work, but an\r\nequally remarkable one. It may be a question whether it is not entitled\r\nto take rank rather as the first book of the nineteenth-century school\r\nthan as the last of the eighteenth. But its author (better known as a\r\npolitician) published no further attempt to pursue the way he had\r\nopened; and though he himself denied its application to the persons who\r\nwere usually identified with its characters, there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that it was rather the record of a personal experience than a\r\ndeliberate effort of art. It is very short, dealing with the love of a\r\ncertain Adolphe for a certain Ellenore and his disenchantment. The\r\npsychological drawing, though one-sided, is astonishingly true, and\r\nthough _sensibilite_ is still present, it has obviously lost its hold\r\nboth on the characters represented and their creator. Deliberate\r\nanalysis appears almost as much as in the work of Beyle himself. It is\r\nin every respect a remarkable book, and many parts of it might have been\r\nwritten at the present day. What distinguishes it from almost all its\r\nforerunners is that there is hardly any attempt at incident, far less at\r\nadventure. The play of thought and feeling is the sole source of\r\ninterest. It is true that the situation is one that could not support a\r\nlong book, and that it is thus rather an essay at the modern analytic\r\nnovel than a finished example of it. But it is such an essay, and very\r\nfar from an unsuccessful one.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[288] The works of fiction written by the great authors of the century\r\nare easily obtainable. _Manon Lescaut_ has been frequently and\r\nsatisfactorily reproduced of late years--the two editions of Glady, with\r\nand without illustrations, being especially noteworthy. Restif de la\r\nBretonne is a literary curiosity whose voluminous works hardly any\r\ncollector possesses in their entirety; but the three volumes of the\r\n_Contemporaines_, selected and edited for the _Nouvelle Collection\r\nJannet_ by M. Assezat, will give a very fair idea of his peculiarities.\r\nOf most of the other authors mentioned convenient, handsome, and not too\r\nexpensive editions will be found in the _Bibliotheque Amusante_ of MM.\r\nGarnier Freres. This includes Mesdames de Tencin, de Fontaines,\r\nRiccoboni, de Beaumont, de Genlis, de Duras, de Souza, as well as\r\nMarivaux and Fievee. Lesage's more remarkable fictions are obtainable at\r\nevery library. Xavier de Maistre forms a single cheap volume. A handsome\r\nlittle edition of Constant's _Adolphe_ has been edited by M. de Lescure\r\nfor the Librairie des Bibliophiles. Cazotte's _Diable Amoureux_ is in\r\nthe _Nouvelle Collection Jannet_. M. Uzanne's reproductions of the prose\r\ntale-tellers are excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHISTORIANS, MEMOIR-WRITERS, LETTER-WRITERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Characteristics and Divisions of Eighteenth-century History.]\r\n\r\nIn the three branches of literature included in this chapter the\r\ninterest of the eighteenth century is great, but unequally divided. In\r\nhistory proper, that is to say, the connected survey from documents of a\r\ngreater or lesser period of the past, the age saw, if not the beginning,\r\ncertainly the maturing of a philosophical conception of the science.\r\nPutting Bossuet out of the question, Vico in Italy, Montesquieu and\r\nTurgot in France, are usually and rightly credited with the working out\r\nof this great conception. But though pretty fully worked, or at least\r\nsketched out, it was not applied in any book of bulk and merit. The\r\nwritings of Montesquieu and Turgot themselves are not history--they are\r\nessays of lesser or greater length in historical philosophy. Nor from\r\nthe merely literary point of view has France any historical production\r\nof the first rank to put forward at this time. The works of greater\r\nextent, such as Rollin's, are of no special literary value; the works of\r\nliterary value, such as Voltaire's studies, are of but small extent, and\r\nrather resemble the historical essay of the preceding century, which\r\nstill continued to be practised, and which had one special practitioner\r\nof merit in Rulhiere. But nothing even distantly approaching the English\r\nmasterpiece of the period, the _Decline and Fall_, was produced; hardly\r\nanything approaching Hume's History. Nor again do the memoirs[289] of\r\nthis time equal those of the seventeenth century in literary power,\r\nthough they are useful as sources of historical and social information.\r\nNo man of letters of the first class has left such work, and no one, not\r\nby profession a man of letters, has by such work come even near the\r\nposition of the Cardinal de Retz or the Duke de Saint Simon, the latter\r\nof whom, it is fair to remember, actually lived into the second half of\r\nthe century. On the other hand, the letter-writers of the time are\r\nnumerous and excellent. Although no one of them equals Madame de Sevigne\r\nin bulk and in completeness of merit, the letters of Mademoiselle de\r\nl'Espinasse, of Madame du Deffand, of Diderot to Mademoiselle Volland,\r\nand some others, are of very great excellence, and almost unsurpassed in\r\ntheir characterization of the intellectual and social peculiarities of\r\nthe time. The absence of regular histories of the first merit would be\r\nmore surprising than it is if it were not fully accounted for by the\r\ndominant peculiarity of the day, which is never to be forgotten in\r\nstudying its history--the absorption, that is to say, of the greater\r\npart of the intellect of the time in the _philosophe_ polemic. Almost\r\nall the histories that were written, except as works of pure erudition,\r\nwere in reality pamphlets intended to point, more or less allegorically,\r\nsome moral as to real or supposed abuses in the social, ecclesiastical,\r\nor political state of France. This peculiarity could not fail to detract\r\nfrom their permanent interest, even if it did not (as it too often did)\r\nmake the authors less careful to give a correct account of their subject\r\nthan to make it serve their purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rollin.]\r\n\r\nThe first regular historian who deserves mention is Charles Rollin, who\r\nperhaps had a longer and wider monopoly of a certain kind of historical\r\ninstruction than any other author. He was born at Paris in January,\r\n1661, of the middle class, and, after studying at the College du\r\nPlessis, he became Professor at the College de France, and, in 1694,\r\nRector of the University; a post in which he distinguished himself by\r\nintroducing many useful and much-needed reforms. He was a Jansenist, but\r\nwas not much inconvenienced in consequence. Rollin's book (that is to\r\nsay the only one by which he is remembered) is his extensive _Histoire\r\nAncienne_, 1730-1738, the work of his advanced years, which was the\r\nstandard treatise on the subject for nearly a century, and was\r\ntranslated into most languages. Although showing no particular\r\nhistorical grasp, written with no power of style, and not universally\r\naccurate, it deserves such praise as may be due to a work of great\r\npractical utility requiring much industrious labour, and not imitated\r\nfrom or much assisted by any previous book. The _Histoire Romaine_,\r\nwhich followed it, was of little worth, but Rollin's _Traite des Etudes_\r\nwas a very useful book in its time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dubos.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boulainvilliers.]\r\n\r\nTwo historians, who hardly deserve the name, are usually ranked together\r\nin this part of French history, partly because they represent almost the\r\nlast of the fabulous school of history-writers, partly because their\r\ndisputes (for they were of opposite factions) have had the honour to be\r\nnoticed by Montesquieu. These were Dubos and Boulainvilliers. The Abbe\r\nDubos was a writer of some merit on a great variety of subjects; his\r\n_Reflexions sur la Poesie et la Peinture_ being of value. His chief\r\nhistorical work is entitled _Histoire Critique de l'Etablissement de la\r\nMonarchie Francaise dans les Gaules_, in which, with a paradoxical\r\npatriotism, which has found some echoes among living historians, he\r\nmaintained that the Frankish invasion of Gaul was the consequence of an\r\namicable invitation, that the Gauls were in no sense conquered, and that\r\nall conclusions based on the supposition of such a conquest were\r\ntherefore erroneous. It is fair to Dubos to say that he had been in a\r\nmanner provoked by the arguments of the Count de Boulainvilliers.\r\nAccording to this latter, the Frankish conquest had resulted in the\r\nestablishment of a dominant caste, which alone had full enfranchisement,\r\nand which was lineally, or at least titularly, represented by the French\r\naristocracy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These reckless\r\nand baseless hypotheses would not require notice, were it not important\r\nto show how long it was before the idea of rigid enquiry into\r\ndocumentary facts on the one hand, and philosophical application of\r\ngeneral laws on the other, were observed in historical writing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Voltaire.]\r\n\r\nMontesquieu himself will come in for mention under the head of\r\nphilosophers, but Voltaire's ubiquity will be maintained in this\r\nchapter. His strictly historical work was indeed considerable, even if\r\nwhat is perhaps the most remarkable of it, the _Essai sur les Moeurs_\r\n(which may be described as a treatise, with instances, on the philosophy\r\nof history, as applied to modern times), be excluded. Besides smaller\r\nworks, the histories of Charles XII. and Peter the Great, the _Age of\r\nLouis XIV._, the _Age of Louis XV._, and the _Annals of the Empire_,\r\nbelong to the class of which we are now treating. Of these there is no\r\ndoubt that the _Siecle de Louis Quatorze_, 1752, is the best, though the\r\nslighter sketches of Charles, 1731, and Peter, 1759, are not undeserving\r\nof the position they have long held as little masterpieces. Voltaire,\r\nhowever, was not altogether well qualified for a historian; indeed, he\r\nhad but few qualifications for the work, except his mastery of a clear,\r\nlight, and lively style. He had no real conception, such as Montesquieu\r\nhad, of the philosophy of history, or of the operation of general\r\ncauses. His reading, though extensive, was desultory and uncritical, and\r\nhe constantly fell into the most grotesque blunders. His prejudices were\r\nvery strong, and he is more responsible than any other single person for\r\nthe absurd and ignorant disdain of the middle ages, which, so long as it\r\nlasted, made comprehension of modern history and society simply\r\nimpossible, because the origins of both were wilfully ignored. These\r\nvarious drawbacks had perhaps less influence on the _Siecle de Louis\r\nQuatorze_ than on any other of his historical works, and it is\r\naccordingly the best. He was well acquainted with the subject, he was\r\nmuch interested in it, it touched few of his prejudices, and he was able\r\nto speak with tolerable freedom about it. The result is excellent, and\r\nit deserves the credit of being almost the first finished history (as\r\ndistinguished from mere diaries like those of L'Estoile) in which not\r\nmerely affairs of state, but literary, artistic, and social matters\r\ngenerally found a place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mably.]\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth quarters of the century are the special period\r\nwhen history was, as has been said, degraded to the level of a party\r\npamphlet, especially in such works as the Abbe Raynal's _Histoire des\r\nIndes_. This was a mere vehicle for _philosophe_ tirades on religious\r\nand political subjects, many if not most of which are known to have\r\nproceeded from Diderot's fertile pen. Crevier and Lebeau, however, names\r\nforgotten now, continued the work of Rollin; and meanwhile the\r\ndescendants of the laborious school of historians mentioned in the last\r\nbook (many of whom survived until far into the century) pursued their\r\nuseful work. Not the least of these was Dom Calmet, author of the\r\nwell-known 'Dictionary of the Bible.' But the chief historical names of\r\nthe later eighteenth century are Mably and Rulhiere. Mably, who might be\r\ntreated equally well under the head of philosophy, was an abbe, and\r\nmoderately orthodox in religion, though decidedly Republican in\r\npolitics. He was a man of some learning; but, if less ignorant than\r\nVoltaire, he was equally blind to the real meaning and influence of the\r\nmiddle ages and of mediaeval institutions. He looked back to the\r\ninstitutions of Rome, and still more of Greece, as models of political\r\nperfection, without making the slightest allowance for the difference of\r\ncircumstances; and to him more than to any one else is due the\r\nnonsensical declamation of the Jacobins about tyrants and champions of\r\nliberty. His works, the _Entretiens de Phocion_, the _Observations sur\r\nl'Histoire de France_, the _Droits de l'Europe fondes sur les Traites_,\r\nare, however, far from destitute of value, though, as generally happens,\r\nit was their least valuable part which (especially when Rousseau\r\nfollowed to enforce similar ideas with his contagious enthusiasm)\r\nproduced the greatest effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rulhiere.]\r\n\r\nRulhiere, who was really a historian of excellence, and who might under\r\nrather more favourable circumstances have been one of the most\r\ndistinguished, was born about 1735. His Christian names were Claude\r\nCarloman. He was of noble birth, was educated at the College\r\nLouis-le-Grand, and served in the army till he was nearly thirty years\r\nold. He then went to St. Petersburg as secretary to the ambassador\r\nBreteuil, whom he also accompanied to Sweden. He returned to Paris and\r\nbegan to write the history of the singular proceedings which during his\r\nstay in the Russian capital had placed Catherine II. on the throne. The\r\nEmpress, it is said, tried both to bribe and to frighten him, but could\r\nobtain nothing but a promise not to print the sketch till her death. He\r\ncontinued to live in Paris, where he was distinguished for rather\r\nill-natured wit and for polished verse-tales and epigrams. For some\r\nreason he devoted himself to the history of Poland. In 1787 he was\r\nelected to the Academy. Then he wrote some _Eclaircissements Historiques\r\nsur les Causes de la Revocation de l'Edit de Nantes_, and is said to\r\nhave begun other historical works. He died in 1791. His 'Anecdotes on\r\nthe Revolution in Russia' did not appear till 1797; his _Histoire de\r\nl'Anarchie de Pologne_ not till even later. The Polish book is\r\nunfinished, and is said to have been garbled in manuscript. But it has\r\nvery considerable merits, though there is perhaps too much discussion in\r\nproportion to the facts given. The Russian anecdotes deserve to rank\r\nwith the historical essays of Retz and Saint-Real in vividness and\r\nprecision of drawing.\r\n\r\nThese are the chief names of the century in history proper, for Volney,\r\nwho concludes it in regard to the study of history, is, like many of his\r\npredecessors, rather a philosopher busying himself with the historical\r\ndepartments and applications of his subject than a historian proper.\r\nStill more may this be said of Diderot in such works as the _Essai sur\r\nles Regnes de Claude et de Neron_. The creation of a school of\r\naccomplished historians was left for the next century, when the\r\nopportunity of such a subject as the French Revolution in the immediate\r\npast, the stimulus of the precepts and views of the great writers on the\r\nphilosophy of history, and lastly the disinterring of the original\r\ndocuments of mediaeval and ancient history, did not fail to produce\r\ntheir natural effect. The number of historians of the first and second\r\nclass born towards the close of the eighteenth century is remarkable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Memoirs. Madame de Staal-Delaunay.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duclos.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Besenval.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame d'Epinay.]\r\n\r\nThe first memoirs, properly so called, which have to be mentioned as\r\nbelonging to the eighteenth century, are those of Mademoiselle Delaunay,\r\nafterwards Madame de Staal. Mademoiselle Delaunay was attached to the\r\nhousehold of the Duchess du Maine, the beautiful, impetuous, and\r\nhighborn wife of one of the stupidest and least interesting of men, who\r\nhappened also to be the illegitimate son of Louis XIV. The Duke du\r\nMaine, or rather his wife, for he himself was nearly as destitute of\r\nambition as of ability, was at the head of the party opposed to that of\r\nwhich the Duke of Orleans (the Regent) was the natural chief, and Saint\r\nSimon the ablest partisan. The 'party of the bastards' failed, but the\r\nduchess kept up a vigorous literary and political agitation against the\r\nRegent. The court (as it may be called) of this opposition was held at\r\nSceaux, and of the doings of this court Madame de Staal has left a very\r\nvivid account. The Marquis d'Argenson, a statesman and a man of great\r\nintelligence, concealed under a rough and clumsy exterior, has left\r\nmemoirs which are valuable for the early and middle part of the reign of\r\nLouis XV. The memoirs, properly so called, of Duclos are of small\r\nextent, but he has left impersonal memoirs of the later reign of Louis\r\nXIV. and the beginning of that of his great-grandson, which are among\r\nthe best historical work of the time. His account of the famous 'system'\r\nof Law is one of the principal sources of information on its subject, as\r\nis his handling of the Cellamare conspiracy and other affairs of the\r\nregency. Duclos was a man not only of considerable literary talent, but\r\nof wide historical reading, which appears amply in his work. The\r\ngossiping memoirs, attributed to Madame du Hausset, bedchamber-woman to\r\nMadame de Pompadour, give many curious details of the middle period of\r\nLouis XV.'s reign; and in the vast collection of tittle-tattle, often\r\nscandalous enough, called the _Memoires de Bachaumont_, much matter of\r\ninterest, and some that is of value, may be found. Among the most\r\nvaluable memoirs of this kind are those of Colle, which have been only\r\nrecently edited in full. Colle, who, though a time-server and an\r\nill-natured man, had much literary talent, was an acute observer, and\r\nenjoyed great opportunities, has left important materials for the middle\r\nof the century. The Baron de Besenval, half a Savoyard and half a Pole,\r\nwho played an important part in the early days of the Revolution, and\r\nwho had previously encouraged Marie Antoinette in the levities, harmless\r\nenough but worse than ill-judged, which had so fatal a result, has left\r\nreminiscences of the later years of Louis XV., and a connected\r\nnarrative of the outbreak of the Revolution. The memoirs concerning the\r\n_Philosophes_ form a library in themselves, even those which concern\r\nVoltaire alone making a not inconsiderable collection. Those of Madame\r\nd'Epinay (the friend of Grimm, of Galiani, and of Rousseau), of\r\nMarmontel, of Morellet, are perhaps the principal of this group.\r\nMarmontel's memoirs are among his best works, and Madame d'Epinay's are\r\namong the most characteristic of the period. There is a certain number\r\nof interesting memoirs of actors and actresses, which dates from this\r\ntime, including those of the great actress Mademoiselle Clairon, the\r\ntragic actor Le Kain, and others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Memoirs.]\r\n\r\nCircumstances rather political than literary have given a place in\r\nliterary history to the memoirs of Linguet and Latude concerning the\r\nBastile. That celebrated building, however, figures largely in the\r\nmemoirs of the time, and the experiences of Voltaire, Marmontel,\r\nCrebillon, and others show how greatly exaggerated is the popular notion\r\nof its dungeons and torments. The so-called memoirs of the Duke de\r\nRichelieu (the type, and a very debased type, of the French noblesse of\r\nthe eighteenth century, as La Rochefoucauld was of that of the\r\nseventeenth) are the work of Soulavie, a literary man and unfrocked abbe\r\nof very dubious character: but they at least rest upon authentic data,\r\nand abound in the most curious information. The President Henault, a man\r\nof probity and learning, has left memoirs of value.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Memoirs of the Revolutionary Period.]\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the collection of memoirs which have reference to\r\nthe Revolution and the Empire is very large. The fortunes of the\r\nill-fated royal family are dealt with in three sets of memoirs, on which\r\nall historians have been obliged to draw, those of Madame Campan, of\r\nWeber, and of Clery, all three of whom were attendants on Louis XVI. and\r\nMarie Antoinette. The memoirs of the first-named are supposed to be the\r\nleast accurate in matters of fact. The ill-natured and factious Madame\r\nde Genlis has left two different works of the memoir kind, the one\r\nentitled _Souvenirs de Felicie_, which is somewhat fictitious in form\r\nand arrangement, but is believed to be accurate enough in facts; the\r\nother, definitely called _Memoirs_, which was written long after date,\r\nand is much coloured by prejudice. The Marquis de Bouille, whose gallant\r\nconduct during the Nancy mutiny set an example which the nobility of\r\nFrance were unfortunately slow to follow, and who would have saved Louis\r\nXVI. in the Varennes flight but for ill-luck and the king's incredible\r\nfolly, has also left memoirs of value; and so has Dumouriez. The memoirs\r\nof Louvet, of Daunou, of Riouffe, of the Duke de Lauzun, of the Comte de\r\nVaublanc, of the Comte de Segur, may be mentioned. The unamiable but\r\nstriking and characteristic figure of Madame Roland lives in memoirs\r\nwhich are among the most celebrated of the time. A group of short but\r\nstriking accounts of eye-witnesses and narrowly-rescued victims remains\r\nto testify to the atrocities of that Second of September, which some\r\nrecent historians have striven in vain to palliate. Many of the men of\r\nthe Revolution, of the servants of the Empire and of their wives, have\r\nleft accounts (of more or less value in point of matter) of the events\r\nof the time, some of which have been only very recently published. Among\r\nthese latter special notice is deserved by the memoirs of Davout, of\r\nMadame de Remusat, and of Count Miot de Melito. But with few exceptions\r\n(those of Madame de Remusat are perhaps the principal) none of these\r\nmemoirs are of great literary importance or interest. They are often\r\nvery valuable to the historian, very curious to the student of manners\r\nor the mere seeker after interesting and amusing facts; but no one of\r\nthem, named or unnamed, can be said to rank in literary interest with\r\nthe work which is so plentiful in the preceding century, and which\r\nconstitutes so large a part of that century's claim to a place of first\r\nimportance in the history of French literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abundance of Letter-writers.]\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise with letters, of which the century contributes to\r\nliterature some of the most remarkable which we possess. It is\r\nimpossible even to give a bare list of those which remain from a time\r\nwhen almost every person of quality knew how to correspond either in the\r\nnatural or the artificial style; but the most remarkable (each of which\r\nis in its way typical of a group) may be noticed with some minuteness.\r\nAmong these the correspondence of Grimm, though one of the bulkiest and\r\nmost important, may be dismissed with a brief reference; for it will be\r\nnoticed again in the succeeding chapter, and most of it is not either\r\nthe work of one man or real correspondence. The flying sheets which\r\nGrimm, largely aided by his complaisant friends, and especially by\r\nDiderot, sent to his august Russian and German correspondents, were in\r\nreality periodical summaries of the state of politics, society, letters,\r\nand art in Paris, not different in subject and style from the printed\r\nnewspaper letters of the present day. They form in the aggregate a very\r\nimportant work, whether looked at from the point of view of history, or\r\nfrom the point of view of literature; but they are not, properly\r\nspeaking, letters. Of the letter-writers proper three women and three\r\nmen may be selected,--Mademoiselle Aisse, Mademoiselle de Lespinasse,\r\nand Madame du Deffand; Voltaire, Diderot, and Galiani.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mademoiselle Aisse.]\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Aisse had a singular history. When a child she was carried\r\noff by Turkish rovers, and sold at Constantinople to the French\r\nambassador, M. de Ferriol. This was at the beginning of the century. Her\r\npurchaser had her brought up carefully at Paris as his property, which\r\nno doubt he always considered her. But in his old age he became\r\nchildish, and Mademoiselle Aisse was free to frequent society to which\r\nshe had been early introduced. She met and fell in love with a certain\r\nChevalier d'Aydie, who himself (at a later date, for the most part,) was\r\na letter-writer of some merit. Her letters to him and of him constitute\r\nher claim to a position in the history of literature. They display the\r\n_sensibilite_ of the time in a decided form, but in a milder one than\r\nthe later letters of Mademoiselle de Lespinasse. But there is something\r\nin them more than mere _sensibilite_--a tender and affectionate spirit\r\nfinding graceful expression and deserving a happier fate. Mademoiselle\r\nAisse, like most other people of her time, turned devout, but earlier\r\nthan most. She died in 1733.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame du Deffand.]\r\n\r\nMadame du Deffand was a very different person. She was born in 1697, and\r\nshe distinguished herself when quite a girl, not merely by her beauty,\r\nbut by her wit and tendency to freethinking. She was married in 1718 to\r\nthe Marquis du Deffand, but soon separated from him, and lived for many\r\nyears the then usual life of gallantry. This merged insensibly into a\r\nlife of literary and philosophical society. Though Madame du Deffand was\r\nnot, like the wealthier but more plebeian Madame Geoffrin, and later\r\nMadame Helvetius, a 'nursing mother of the philosophers,' in the sense\r\nof supplying their necessities, her salon in the Rue Saint Dominique was\r\nlong one of the chief resorts of philosophism. In 1753 she became blind,\r\nbut this made little difference in her appetite for society. She lived\r\nlike many other great ladies in a monastery. She died in 1780. As a\r\nletter-writer Madame du Deffand was the correspondent of most of the\r\ngreatest men of letters of the time (Voltaire, D'Alembert, Henault,\r\nMontesquieu, etc.). But her most remarkable correspondence, and perhaps\r\nher most interesting one, was with Horace Walpole, the most French of\r\ncontemporary Englishmen. Their friendship, for which it is hard to find\r\nan exact name, unless, perhaps, it may be called a kind of passionate\r\ncommunity of tastes, belongs to the later part of her long life. Madame\r\ndu Deffand is the typical French lady of the eighteenth century, as\r\nRichelieu is the typical _grand seigneur_. She was perhaps the wittiest\r\nwoman (in the strict sense of the adjective) who ever lived[290], and an\r\nastonishingly large proportion of the best sayings of the time is traced\r\nor attributed to her. Nearly seventy years of conversation and a great\r\ncorrespondence did not exhaust her faculty of acute sallies, of ruthless\r\ncriticism, of cynical but clearsighted judgment on men and things. But\r\nshe was thoroughly unamiable, purely selfish, jealous, spiteful,\r\ndestitute of humour, if full of wit. A comparison with Madame de Sevigne\r\nshows how the French character had, in the upper ranks at least,\r\ndegenerated (it is worth remembering that Madame du Deffand was born\r\njust after Madame de Sevigne's death), though it must be admitted that\r\nthe earlier character shows perhaps the germs of what is repulsive in\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mademoiselle de Lespinasse.]\r\n\r\nThe third most remarkable lady letter-writer of the century,\r\nMademoiselle de Lespinasse, was closely connected with Madame du\r\nDeffand. She was indeed her companion, her coadjutor, and her rival.\r\nJulie Jeanne Eleonore de Lespinasse was in reality the illegitimate\r\ndaughter of a lady of rank, the Countess d'Albon, who lived apart from\r\nher husband, and the name Lespinasse was merely a fancy name taken from\r\nthe D'Albon genealogy. She was born, or at least baptized, at Lyons on\r\nthe 19th November, 1732. Her mother, who practically acknowledged her,\r\ndied when she was fifteen, leaving her fairly provided for. But her\r\nhalf-brothers and sisters deprived her of most of her portion, though\r\nfor a time they gave her a home. In 1754 Madame du Deffand, to whom she\r\nhad been recommended, and who had just been struck with blindness,\r\ninvited her to come and live with her, which she did, after some\r\nhesitation. For ten years the two presided jointly over their society,\r\nbut at last Madame du Deffand's jealousy broke out. Mademoiselle de\r\nLespinasse retired, taking with her not a few of the habitues of the\r\nsalon, with D'Alembert at their head. Madame Geoffrin seems to have\r\nendowed her, and she established herself in the Rue de Bellechasse,\r\nwhere D'Alembert before long came to join her. They lived in a curious\r\nsort of relationship for more than ten years, until Mademoiselle de\r\nLespinasse died on the 22nd May, 1776. During this time she was a\r\ngracious hostess and a bond of union to many men of letters, especially\r\nthose of the younger _philosophe_ school. But this is not what gives her\r\nher place here. Her claim rests upon a collection of love-letters, not\r\naddressed to D'Alembert. She was thirty-four when the earliest of her\r\nlove affairs began, and had never been beautiful. When she died she was\r\nforty-four, and her later letters are more passionate than the earlier.\r\nHer first lover was a young Spaniard, the Marquis Gonsalvo de Mora; her\r\nsecond, the Count de Guibert, a poet and essayist of no great merit, a\r\nmilitary reformer said to have been of some talent, and pretty evidently\r\na bad-hearted coxcomb. To him the epistles we have are addressed. All\r\nthe circumstances of these letters are calculated to make them\r\nridiculous, yet there is hardly any word which they less deserve. The\r\ngreat defect of the eighteenth century is that its _sensibilite_\r\nexcludes real passion. The men and women of feeling of the period always\r\nseem as if they were playing at feeling; the affairs of the heart, which\r\noccupy so large a place in its literature, show only the progress of a\r\ncertain kind of game which has its rules and stages to which the\r\nplayers must conform, but which, when once over, leaves no more traces\r\nthan any other kind of game. To this Mademoiselle de Lespinasse is a\r\nconspicuous exception. It has been said of her that her letters burn the\r\npaper they are written on with the fervency of their sentiment, nor is\r\nthe expression an exaggerated one. Except in Rousseau and (in a\r\ndifferent form) in _Manon Lescaut_, it is in these letters that we must\r\nlook for almost the only genuine passion of the time. It is no doubt\r\nunreal to a certain degree, morbid also in an even greater degree as\r\nregards what is real in it. But it is in no sense consciously affected,\r\nand conscious affectation was the bane of the period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Voltaire.]\r\n\r\nThe three examples which have been chosen of the masculine\r\nletter-writing of the period are of somewhat wider range. Mademoiselle\r\nAisse and Mademoiselle de Lespinasse show in various forms the amiable\r\nweaknesses of womankind, Madame du Deffand its unamiable strength. The\r\nletters of Voltaire, of Diderot, and of the Abbe Galiani are not so\r\ntypical of a sex, but are more representative of individuals and at the\r\nsame time of the age. Voltaire's correspondence is simply enormous in\r\npoint of bulk. Fresh letters of his are constantly being discovered and\r\nedited even now. His long life, his extraordinary industry, his position\r\nduring nearly half a century as first one of the leading men of letters,\r\nand then unquestionably the leading man of letters of Europe, the\r\ncurious diversity of his interests, even the prosperity in point of\r\nfortune which made him command the services of secretaries and\r\nunder-strappers, while humbler men of letters had to do the mechanical\r\nwork of composition for themselves, all contributed to bring about this\r\nfecundity. The consequence is, that not only is the correspondence of\r\nVoltaire of vast extent but it is also of the most various character. We\r\nhave from him early love-letters, letters to private friends of all\r\ndates, business letters, literary letters, letters to great persons,\r\nletters intended for publication, letters not intended for publication,\r\nflattering letters, insulting letters, benevolent letters, patronising\r\nletters, begging letters, letters of almost every sort and kind that the\r\ningenuity of human imagination can conceive or the diversity of human\r\nrelationships and circumstances require. Partial critics have contended\r\nthat the singular quality of Voltaire's genius might be sufficiently\r\nexemplified from his letters, if no other documents were forthcoming.\r\nWithout going quite so far as this, it may be allowed that his\r\ncorrespondence is a remarkable monument of those qualities in literature\r\nwhich enable a man to express himself happily and rapidly on any subject\r\nthat happens to present itself. The letters of Voltaire do not perhaps\r\nsupply any ground for disputing Carlyle's sentence on Voltaire (a\r\nsentence which has excited the wrath of French critics) that there is\r\nnot one great thought in all his works. But they enable us, even better\r\nthan any other division of those works, to appreciate the singular\r\nflexibility of his intellect, the extraordinarily wide range of his\r\ninterests and sympathies, the practical talents which accompanied his\r\nliterary genius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diderot.]\r\n\r\nDiderot's correspondence is also considerable in bulk, though not in\r\nthat respect to be compared to Voltaire's. It has several minor\r\ndivisions, the chief of which is a body of letters addressed to the\r\nsculptor Falconnet in Russia. But the main claim of this versatile\r\nwriter and most fertile thinker to rank in this chapter lies in his\r\nletters to Mademoiselle Volland, a lady of mature years, to whom, in his\r\nown middle and old age, he was, after the fashion of the time, much\r\nattached. These letters were not published till forty or fifty years\r\nafter his death, and it is not too much to say that they supply not only\r\nthe most vivid picture of Diderot himself which is attainable, but also\r\nthe best view of the later and extremer _philosophe_ society. Many, if\r\nnot most of them, are written from that society's head-quarters, the\r\ncountry house of the Baron d'Holbach, at Grandval, where Diderot was an\r\never welcome visitor. This society had certain drawbacks which made it\r\nirksome, not merely to orthodox and sober persons, but to fastidious\r\njudges who were not much burdened with scruples. Horace Walpole, for\r\ninstance, found himself bored by it. But it was the most characteristic\r\nsociety of the time, and Diderot's letters are the best pictures of it,\r\nbecause, unlike some not dissimilar work, they unite great vividness and\r\npower of description with an obvious absence of the least design to\r\n'cook,' that is to say, to invent or to disguise facts and characters.\r\nDiderot, who possessed every literary faculty except the faculty of\r\ntaking pains and the faculty of adroitly choosing subjects, was marked\r\nout as the describer of such a society as this, where brilliancy was the\r\none thing never wanting, where eccentricity of act and speech was the\r\nrule, where originals abounded and took care to make the most of their\r\noriginality, and where all restraint of convention was deliberately cast\r\naside. The character and tendencies of this society have been very\r\nvariously judged, and there is no need to decide here between the judges\r\nfurther than to say that, on the whole, the famous essay of Carlyle on\r\nDiderot not inadequately reduces to miniature Diderot's own picture of\r\nit. Only the extremest prejudice can deny the extraordinary merit of\r\nthat picture itself, the vividness and effortless effect with which the\r\nmen and women dealt with--their doings and their sayings--are presented,\r\nthe completeness and dramatic force of the presentation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galiani.]\r\n\r\nThe last of the epistolers selected for comment, the Abbe Galiani, has\r\nthis peculiarity as distinguished from Voltaire and Diderot, that he is\r\nlittle except a letter-writer to the present and probably to all future\r\ngenerations of readers. He will indeed appear again, but his dealings\r\nwith political economy are of merely ephemeral interest. Galiani was of\r\na noble Neapolitan family, was attached to the Neapolitan Legation in\r\nParis, and made himself a darling of _philosophe_ society there. When he\r\nwas recalled to his native country and endowed with sufficiently\r\nlucrative employments, his chief consolation for the loss of Parisian\r\nsociety was to gather as far as he could a copy of it--consisting partly\r\nof Italians, partly of foreign and especially English visitors--to\r\nItaly, to study classical archaeology, in which (and especially in the\r\ndepartment of numismatics) he was an expert, and to write letters to his\r\nFrench friends. In his long residence at Paris, Galiani had acquired a\r\nstyle not entirely destitute of Italianisms, but all the more piquant on\r\nthat account. His letters were published early in this century, but\r\nincompletely and in a somewhat garbled fashion. They have recently had\r\nthe benefit of two different complete editions. They are addressed, the\r\ngreater part of them to Madame d'Epinay, and the remainder to various\r\ncorrespondents. Galiani had the reputation of being one of the best\r\ntalkers of his time, and the memoirs and correspondence of his friends\r\n(especially Diderot's) contain many reported sayings of his which amply\r\nsupport the reputation. Like many famous talkers, he seems to have been\r\nnot quite so ready with the pen as with the tongue. But it is only by\r\ncomparison that his letters can be depreciated. Less voluminous and\r\nmanifold than Voltaire, less picturesque than Diderot, he is a model of\r\ngeneral letter-writing. He is also remarkable as an exponent of the\r\ncurious feeling of the time towards religion; a feeling which was\r\nprevalent in the cultivated classes (with certain differences) all over\r\nEurope. Galiani was not, like some of his French friends, a\r\nproselytising atheist. He held some ecclesiastical employments in his\r\nown country with decency, and died with all due attention to the rites\r\nof the Church. But it is obvious that he was as little of a Christian,\r\nin any definite sense of the word, as any humanist of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe light thrown in this fashion upon the social, moral, and\r\nintellectual characteristics of the time constitutes the chief value of\r\nall its historical literature, except the great philosophico-historical\r\nworks of Montesquieu and Turgot. It has a certain flimsiness about it;\r\nit is brilliant journalism rather than literature properly so called;\r\nthe dialect in which it is written wants the gravity and sonorousness,\r\nthe colour and the poetry, of the seventeenth and earlier centuries. But\r\nit is unmatched in power of social portraiture. Written, as much of it\r\nis, by men of the middle class, and more of it by men who, from whatever\r\nclass they sprang, were deeply interested in social, economical, and\r\npolitical problems, it is free from that ignoring of any life and class\r\nexcept that of the nobility which mars much of the work of earlier\r\ntimes. The picture it gives is very far from being a flattering one. The\r\nnature to which the mirror is held up is in most cases a decidedly\r\ncorrupt nature; but the mirror is held frankly, and the reflection is\r\nuseful to posterity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[289] In studying the history, and especially the memoirs, of the\r\neighteenth century, the reader is at a disadvantage, inasmuch as the\r\nadmirable collections of MM. Buchon, Petitot, Michaud et Poujoulat,\r\netc., do not extend beyond its earliest years. Their place is very\r\nimperfectly supplied by a collection in twenty-eight small volumes,\r\nedited by F. Barriere for MM. Didot. This is useful as far as it goes,\r\nbut it is very far from complete; much of it is in extract only, and the\r\ncomponent parts of it are not selected as judiciously as they might be.\r\nSeparate editions of the principal memoirs of the century are of course\r\nobtainable, and the number is being constantly increased; but such\r\nseparate editions are far less useful than the collections which enable\r\nthe memoir-writing of France during five centuries of its history to be\r\nstudied at an advantage scarcely to be paralleled in the literature of\r\nany other nation.\r\n\r\n[290] Her earlier contemporary, Madame de Tencin, is her chief\r\ncompetitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nESSAYISTS, MINOR MORALISTS, CRITICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occasional Writing in the Eighteenth-century. Periodicals.]\r\n\r\nWhat may be, for want of a better word, called occasional writing in\r\nprose received a considerable development during the eighteenth century.\r\nSome of the forms which it had previously taken, the _Pensee_, the\r\nmaxim, and so forth, were less practised, though at the beginning and\r\nend of our present period two remarkable men, Vauvenargues and Joubert,\r\ndistinguished themselves in them, and in the form of satirical aphorism\r\nChamfort and Rivarol, before and during the Revolution, brought them to\r\ngreat perfection. But it was powerfully encouraged by the institution of\r\nofficial _eloges_, pronounced in the French Academy on famous men of the\r\nimmediate or remoter past, and of prize essays, subjects for which, in\r\never increasing numbers, were proposed, not merely by that body, but by\r\nprovincial societies of a similar but humbler kind. More than all this,\r\nthe growth of periodical literature, though not exactly rapid, was\r\nsteady, and gave opportunity for the cultivation of the two main\r\nbranches of occasional writing as it is understood in modern times,\r\nnamely, social or ethical essays of the Addisonian kind, and critical\r\nstudies, literary or other. A great impetus was given to this by the\r\nnovelist Prevost, who, after his return from England, edited, as has\r\nbeen observed, more than one avowed imitation of the English _Spectator_\r\nand _Tatler_. At the beginning of the century the chief place among\r\nnewspapers was occupied by the _Mercure Galant_, which had enjoyed the\r\ncontempt of La Bruyere, and the management of Vise and Thomas Corneille.\r\nTowards the middle and end of the period, the _Gazette de France_, under\r\nthe management of Suard, held the principal place with a somewhat\r\nhigher aim; and of non-official publications the Jesuit _Journal de\r\nTrevoux_ and the anti-_philosophe Annee Litteraire_ of Freron were\r\nnotable. It was not till after the beginning of the Revolution that\r\njournalism proper spread and multiplied, and that journalists became a\r\npower. A short notice of the chief of these will be found lower down in\r\nthis chapter, but a full history of French journalism is impossible\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fontenelle.]\r\n\r\nThe first place in point of time, and not the least in point of\r\nimportance, among the occasional writers of the eighteenth century, is\r\ndue to Fontenelle. The personal name of this curious writer, who is\r\nperhaps the most striking example in literary history of multifarious\r\ntalent and unwearied industry just stopping short, despite their\r\ncombination, of genius, was Bernard le Bovier, and his mother was a\r\nsister of Corneille, whose life Fontenelle himself wrote. He was\r\neducated by the Jesuits and studied for the bar, but was unsuccessful as\r\nan advocate, and soon gave up active practice. He came to Paris very\r\nyoung, and soon became distinguished, after a fashion, in society and\r\nliterature. He was one of the last of the _precieux_, or rather he was\r\nthe inventor of a new combination of literature and gallantry which at\r\nfirst exposed him to not a little satire. Unfortunately too for him he\r\ntried first to emulate his uncles in the drama, for which he had no\r\ntalent, and one of his plays (_Aspar_), failing completely, gave his\r\nenemies abundant opportunity. No one, however, illustrated better than\r\nFontenelle the saying that 'no man was ever written down except by\r\nhimself.' He was the butt of the four most dangerous satirists of his\r\ntime--Racine, Boileau, La Bruyere, and J. B. Rousseau; but though the\r\nepigrams which Racine and Rousseau directed against him are among the\r\nbest in the language, and though the 'portrait' of Cydias, in the\r\n_Caracteres_, at least equals them, Fontenelle received hardly any\r\ndamage from these. Finding that he was not likely to be a successful\r\ndramatic poet, even in opera, he turned to prose, and wrote 'dialogues\r\nof the dead,' in avowed imitation of Lucian, and a kind of romance\r\ncalled '_Lettres du Chevalier d'Her_...,' in which he may be said to\r\nhave set the example of the elaborate and rather affected style,\r\nafterwards called Marivaudage, from his most famous pupil. Even here\r\nhis success was doubtful, and he again changed his ground. He had paid\r\nsome attention to science, and he saw that there was an opening in the\r\ngrowing curiosity of educated people for scientific popularising. To\r\nthis and to literary criticism and history he devoted himself for the\r\nremainder of his long life, becoming President of the Academy of\r\nSciences, and virtual dictator of the Academie Francaise. His _Eloges_\r\nand his academic essays generally were highly popular. But his chief\r\nsingle works are the famous _Entretien sur la Pluralite des Mondes_, an\r\nexample of singularly hardy speculation, and of no contemptible\r\nlearning, artfully disguised by an easy style, and his _Histoire des\r\nOracles_, of which much the same may be said. With hardly diminished\r\npowers Fontenelle achieved an age not often paralleled in literary\r\nhistory, though his contemporary, Saint Aulaire, a minor poet, nearly\r\nequalled it. He died in his hundredth year, and almost at the end of it,\r\nhis long life extending from the very earliest glories of the Siecle de\r\nLouis XIV. to the very hottest period of the Encyclopaedist battle. The\r\nsingular variety of his works, and his force of character, disguised\r\nunder a somewhat frivolous exterior, but enabling him to live down\r\nenmity and ridicule which would have crushed most men, would of\r\nthemselves make Fontenelle a remarkable figure in literature. But his\r\nactual work has more merits than that of mere variety. He realised quite\r\nas keenly as his enemy La Bruyere the importance of manner in\r\nliterature, though his taste was hardly so pure. If not exactly an\r\noriginal thinker, he was an acute and comprehensive one, and forestalled\r\nmost of his contemporaries in taking the direction consciously which\r\nthey were pursuing almost without knowing it. He fully appreciated the\r\nvalue of paradox as stimulating men's minds and giving flavour to\r\nliterature; and his positive wit was very considerable. To not many men\r\nare more good sayings attributed, and the goodness of these is not\r\nalways verbal only. The most famous of them, uttered in defence of his\r\npeculiar union of heterodoxy and caution, 'I may have my fist full of\r\ntruth, and yet only care to open my little finger,' may be immoral or\r\nnot, but it expressed very early, and with singular force, the\r\nintellectual attitude of two whole generations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: La Motte.]\r\n\r\nInseparable from Fontenelle's name in literary history, as the two were\r\nlong closely united in life, is the name of La Motte. La Motte was a\r\nmuch younger man than Fontenelle, and he died more than thirty years\r\nbefore him, but during the first thirty years of the century the pair\r\nexercised a kind of joint sovereignty in the Belles Lettres. They\r\nrevived the quarrel of the ancients and moderns, inclining to the modern\r\nside. But La Motte's translation of Homer, or rather his adaptation (for\r\nhe omitted about half), is not of a nature to inspire much confidence in\r\nhis ability to judge the matter, though his essays and letters on the\r\nsubject are triumphs of ingenious word-fence. Unlike Fontenelle, La\r\nMotte had one considerable dramatic success with the pathetic subject of\r\n_Ines de Castro_, and his fables are not devoid of merit. It was,\r\nhowever, as a prose writer of the occasional kind, and especially as a\r\nparadoxical essayist, that he earned and deserved most fame, his prose\r\nstyle being superior to Fontenelle's own.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vauvenargues.]\r\n\r\nThe next name deserving of mention belongs to a very different writer.\r\nLuc de Clapiers, Marquis de Vauvenargues, covered in his brief space of\r\nlife not a third of the period allotted to Fontenelle, who was nearly\r\nsixty when Vauvenargues was born, and outlived him ten years. Nor did he\r\nleave any single work of consequence. Yet his scanty writings are far\r\nmore valuable in matter, if not in form, than those of the witty\r\ncentenarian. Vauvenargues was born at Aix, in Provence, on the 6th of\r\nAugust, 1715. His family was ancient and honourable, but appears to have\r\nbeen poor, and his education was interrupted by the bad health which\r\ncontinued throughout his short life. Nevertheless he entered the army at\r\nthe age of eighteen. After this he had scanty opportunities of study,\r\nand it is said that he was ignorant not only of Greek but even of Latin.\r\nHe served at first in Italy, and then for some years was employed on\r\ngarrison duty. At the outbreak of the war of the Austrian succession his\r\nregiment was sent into Germany, and he had a full share of the hardships\r\nof the Bohemian campaign. No promotion came to him, his means were\r\nalmost exhausted, and in 1744 he resigned his commission, after taking\r\nthe curiously unworldly step of writing directly to the king, asking for\r\na place in the diplomatic service. An application to the minister of\r\nforeign affairs was not much more successful, and Vauvenargues, whose\r\nevil star pursued him, had no sooner established himself with his family\r\nthan a bad attack of small-pox destroyed the little health he still had.\r\nHe set to work, however, to write, and in the short time before his\r\ndeath actually published some of his works, and left others in a\r\ncondition ready for publication. He lived in Paris for the last three\r\nyears of his life, and died in 1747, at the age of thirty-two. Latterly\r\nhe had made acquaintance with Voltaire, who entertained a very high and\r\ngenerous opinion of his talents, due perhaps partly to the remarkable\r\ndifference of their respective characters and points of view.\r\nVauvenargues' principal work is an _Introduction a la Connoissance de\r\nl'Esprit Humain_, besides which he left a considerable number of maxims,\r\nreflections, etc., on points of ethics and of literary criticism. In the\r\nlast part of his work there is more curiosity than instruction. It is,\r\nhowever, in its way an instructive thing to see that a man of talent and\r\neven of genius could object to Moliere for having chosen _des sujets\r\ntrop bas_, while he speaks of Boileau in the most enthusiastic terms.\r\nThe truth (and in the history of literature it is a very important\r\ntruth) is that Vauvenargues was too little versed in any language but\r\nhis own to have the requisite range of comparison necessary for literary\r\ncriticism, and that his real interest in literature was almost entirely\r\nproportioned to its bearing upon conduct. His maxims, his _Connoissance\r\nde l'Esprit_, his _Conseils a un Jeune Homme_, etc., are all occupied\r\nalmost entirely with questions of morality. Vauvenargues (and in this he\r\nwas remarkable) stood entirely aloof from the sceptical movement of his\r\nage. There was, indeed, a certain scepticism in him, as in almost all\r\nthinkers, but it was of the stamp of Pascal's, not in the least mocking\r\nor polemical, and even, as compared with Pascal's own, much less\r\nstrictly theological. In most of his writings he shows himself an\r\nearnest and upright man, profoundly convinced of the importance of right\r\nconduct, gifted with an acute perception of its usual moving springs and\r\ndirections, not remarkable for humour or poetical feeling, but serious,\r\nsober, and a little stoical. His literary characteristics reflect some\r\nof these peculiarities, and also betray something of his neglected\r\neducation. He is never slovenly in thought, but he sometimes shocked the\r\nexact verbal critics of the eighteenth century by such phrases as 'les\r\nsens sont flattes d'agir, de galoper un cheval,' whereupon his censor\r\nannotates 'neglige. Les sens ne galopent pas un cheval.' A more serious\r\nfault is that, in his shorter maxims especially, he does not observe the\r\nrule of absolute lucidity which La Rochefoucauld, who was as much his\r\nmodel in point of style as he was his opposite in general views, never\r\nbreaks through. His sayings (it is a merit as well as a drawback) are\r\noften rather suggestive than expressive; they remind the reader of his\r\nown curious comparison of Corneille with Racine, 'les heros de Corneille\r\ndisent souvent de grandes choses sans les inspirer; ceux de Racine les\r\ninspirent sans les dire.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D'Aguesseau.]\r\n\r\nContemporary with Fontenelle and La Motte was the Chancellor\r\nD'Aguesseau, one of the most prominent figures of the earlier reign of\r\nLouis XV., a steady defender of orthodoxy--yet, as was seen in the case\r\nof the Encyclopaedia, willing to assist enlightenment--a man of\r\nirreproachable character, and a writer of some merit. D'Aguesseau was\r\nborn in 1668, and died in 1751. He early received considerable\r\npreferment in the law, and held the seals at intervals for the greater\r\npart of the last thirty years of his life. He was a defender of\r\nGallicanism--indeed, he was suspected of Jansenist leanings--and a man\r\nof great benevolence in private life. His legal and historical learning\r\nwas immense, and he was not without some tincture of science. He\r\ndeserves a place here chiefly for his speeches on public occasions,\r\nwhich were in effect elaborate moral essays. An important part of them\r\nconsists of what were called _Mercuriales_ (that is to say, discourses\r\npronounced on certain Wednesdays (Die Mercurii) by the first president\r\nof the Parliament of Paris) on the abuses of the day, the duties of\r\njudges, the nature of justice, and similar subjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duclos.]\r\n\r\nAnother writer, who has been mentioned more than once before, held\r\nsomewhat aloof from the Encyclopaedists, though he was not, like\r\nD'Aguesseau, definitely orthodox, or, like Vauvenargues, severely moral.\r\nCharles Pinaud Duclos was one of the most miscellaneous of the\r\nmiscellaneous writers of the time. He held the office of historiographer\r\nroyal, and produced some remarkable works of the historical kind, one of\r\nwhich has been noticed. He composed novels in a fanciful style midway\r\nbetween Crebillon and Marivaux. He also wrote on grammar, but some of\r\nhis best work consists of short academic essays, and of a moral study\r\ncalled _Considerations sur les Moeurs de Notre Temps_, which is both\r\nwell written and shows discernment. Duclos' character has been somewhat\r\nvariously represented, but the unfavourable reports (which are in the\r\nminority) may probably be traced to the studied brusqueness of his\r\nmanners, and to his unwillingness to make common cause with the\r\n_philosophe_ coterie, though, if some stories are to be believed, he\r\noften conversed and argued quite in their style.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marmontel.]\r\n\r\nYet another typical figure of the same numerous class is Jean Francois\r\nMarmontel, one of the most eminent professional men of letters of the\r\nsecond class. Marmontel's moral tales, his _Belisaire_, and his plays\r\nhave already been noticed, but his main place in literature is that of a\r\njournalist and critic. He was born at Bort, in the district of Limoges,\r\nin 1723, and obtained some provincial reputation in letters. Introduced\r\nto Voltaire in 1746, he began as a dramatist, and, after some failures,\r\nacquired the protection of Madame de Pompadour. He was made editor of\r\nthe _Mercure_, which gave him an influential position and a competence.\r\nHe afterwards succeeded Duclos as historiographer, notwithstanding the\r\noutcry which had been made against his _Belisaire_. He had contributed\r\nalmost all the minor articles on literary subjects to the Encyclopaedia,\r\nand these were collected and published as _Elements de Litterature_ in\r\n1787. He died in 1799. The _Elements de Litterature_ are, with the\r\n_Cours de Litterature_ of La Harpe, the chief source of information as\r\nto eighteenth-century criticism of the fashionable kind in France. They\r\nare very voluminous, and, from the circumstances of their original form,\r\ndeal with a vast number of subjects. The style is for the most part\r\nsimple and good, destitute alike of the dryness and of the bombast which\r\nwere the two faults of contemporary writing. But Marmontel's system of\r\ncriticism will not bear a moment's examination. It consists simply in\r\nthe assumption that Racine, Boileau (though he was at first recalcitrant\r\nto Boileau, and had to be admonished by Voltaire that _ca porte\r\nmalheur_), and their contemporaries are infallible models, and in the\r\napplication of this principle to all other nations. The passion for\r\nfinding plausible general reasons also leads Marmontel into grotesque\r\naberrations, as where he gives three reasons for English success in\r\npoetry as contrasted with our inferiority in the other arts. First,\r\nEnglishmen, loving glory, saw early that poetry acquired glory for a\r\nnation. Secondly, being naturally given to sadness and meditation, they\r\nwish for emotions to distract and move them. Thirdly, their genius is\r\nproper to poetry. This last remark, the reader should observe, comes\r\nfrom a countryman of Moliere, a man who must have read the _Malade\r\nImaginaire_, and who was moreover a man of much more than ordinary\r\ntalent. Marmontel often has acute remarks, and his blunders and\r\nabsurdities are rather symptomatic of the false state in which criticism\r\nwas at the time than of individual shortcomings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: La Harpe.]\r\n\r\nSomewhat younger than Marmontel was La Harpe, who pursued the same lines\r\nof dramatic poetry and literary criticism, the latter with more success\r\nin his kind, so much so, that Malherbe, Boileau, and he may be ranked\r\ntogether as the three representatives of the infancy, flourishing, and\r\ndecadence of the 'classical' theory of literary criticism in France. La\r\nHarpe was born at Paris in 1739, was brought up by charity, gained a\r\nreputation as a brilliant exhibitioner at the College d'Harcourt, and,\r\nafter the mishap of being imprisoned for a libel, obtained new success\r\nat the Academy competitions. He acquired the favour of Voltaire, and\r\nfairly launched himself in literature. For many years he furnished\r\ntragedies to the stage, and criticised the literary work of others with\r\na singular mixture of acuteness, pedantry, and ill-temper. He was\r\nconverted from Republicanism by an imprisonment during the Terror, and\r\nbecame a violent conservative and defender of orthodoxy. He died in\r\n1803. His principal critical work is his _Cours de Litterature_, which\r\nwas the work chiefly of his later days. La Harpe had very considerable\r\ntalent, which was however warped by the false and narrow system of\r\ncriticism he adopted, and by his personal ill-temper and overbearing\r\ndisposition. He is even more than Boileau the type of the\r\nschoolmaster-critic, who marks passages for correction according to\r\ncut-and-dried rules instead of attempting to judge the author according\r\nto his own standard. Yet, if he is the most typical example of the\r\nschool, he is also perhaps the best. In dealing with authors of his own\r\ncentury, he is especially worthy of attention, because for the most part\r\nthey themselves had before them the standards which he used, and his\r\nmethod is therefore relevant as far as it goes. La Harpe wrote well in\r\nthe fashion of his day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thomas.]\r\n\r\nWith Duclos, Marmontel, and La Harpe, Thomas is usually named. This\r\nwriter, like others of our present subjects, was chiefly a composer of\r\nacademic _Eloges_, _Memoires_, _Discours_, and the like. He also wrote a\r\nbook on _Les Femmes_, a subject which he treated, as he did most things,\r\nwith seriousness, and with a mixture of declamation and sentimentality.\r\nHis literary value is but small.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Orthodox Apologists.]\r\n\r\nOf the definitely orthodox party only two names need be mentioned, that\r\nof the Abbe Guenee, who devoted himself to exposing Voltaire's numerous\r\nslips in erudition in his _Lettres de Quelques Juifs_, and that of the\r\nAbbe Bergier, who is chiefly noteworthy as having held the singular post\r\nof official refuter of the Encyclopaedists, in virtue of which\r\nappointment he received two thousand _livres_ per annum from the General\r\nAssembly of the clergy for sixteen years. He wrote with assiduity, but\r\nwas not read, and three years before the Revolution he lost his annuity,\r\nwhich the Assembly struck off. Bergier was a man of learning, industry,\r\nand good faith, but unfortunately he did not possess sufficient literary\r\ntalent to execute the task entrusted to him. The Abbe Guenee, on the\r\ncontrary, was a fair match even for Voltaire, but he did not attempt,\r\nperhaps it was too early to attempt, anything more than skirmishing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Freron.]\r\n\r\nA bitter personal opponent of La Harpe, and a famous man in literary\r\nhistory, was Freron. Elie Catherine Freron was born at Quimper in\r\nBritanny in 1719, and was educated by the Jesuits. He began a critical\r\njournal when he was only seven-and-twenty, under the title (not so\r\nstrange then as now) of _Lettres de Madame la Comtesse de_.... But he\r\nhad already contributed to the _Observations_ and _Jugements_ of\r\nDesfontaines. The _Lettres_ were suppressed in 1749, but continued\r\nunder another title, and at last, in 1754, became the celebrated _Annee\r\nLitteraire_, which for twenty years was full of gall and wormwood for\r\nVoltaire and all his partisans. Voltaire was never slow to retaliate in\r\nsuch matters, and his retorts culminated in the play of _L'Ecossaise_,\r\nin which Freron was caricatured under the title Frelon (hornet). Every\r\neffort was made by the Encyclopaedists (who were not in the least\r\ntolerant in practice) to procure the suppression of the _Annee_. But\r\nFreron had solid supports in high places and held on gallantly. It is\r\nsaid that his death, in 1776, was caused by a report that the\r\nsuppression had been at last obtained. He certainly suffered both from\r\ngout and from heart disease, complaints not unlikely to make a sudden\r\nshock fatal. Freron, like his English prototype John Dennis, has had the\r\ndisadvantage that his adversaries were numerous, witty, not too\r\nscrupulous, and on the winning side. His personal character seems to\r\nhave been none of the most amiable. But he was more frequently right\r\nthan wrong in his criticisms on detached points, and his literary\r\nstandards were decidedly higher and better than those of his enemies. He\r\nhad moreover abundant wit and an imperturbable temper, which enabled him\r\nto turn the laugh against Voltaire in his criticism of the first\r\nrepresentation of _L'Ecossaise_ itself.\r\n\r\nTwo other adversaries of Voltaire who deserve notice as literary critics\r\nwere the Abbe Desfontaines (already mentioned) and Palissot.\r\nDesfontaines was a man of doubtful character; but it is not certain that\r\nhe was in the wrong in the dispute which changed him from a friend into\r\nan enemy of Voltaire, and, like Freron, he very frequently hit blots\r\nboth in the patriarch's works and in those of his disciples. Palissot\r\nwas the author of a play called _Les Philosophes_, an _Ecossaise_ on the\r\nother side, in which Rousseau, Diderot, and others were outrageously\r\nridiculed. There was no great merit in this, but Palissot was not a bad\r\ncritic in some ways, and his notes on French classics, especially\r\nCorneille, frequently show much greater taste than those of most\r\ncontemporary annotators.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philosophe Criticism. D'Alembert, Diderot.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Les Feuilles de Grimm.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diderot's Salons]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His General Criticism.]\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the _philosophes_ themselves gave considerable attention\r\nto criticism. Voltaire wrote this, as he wrote everything, his\r\nprincipal critical work being his Commentary on Corneille, in which the\r\nconstraint of general dramatic and poetic theory which the critic\r\nimposes on himself, and the merely conventional opinions in which he too\r\noften indulges, do not interfere with much acute criticism on points of\r\ndetail. D'Alembert distinguished himself by his extraordinarily careful\r\nand polished _Eloges_, or obituary notices, which remain among the\r\nfinest examples of critical appreciation of a certain kind to be found\r\nin literature. Although he did not definitely attempt a new theory of\r\ncriticism, D'Alembert's vigorous intellect and unbiassed judgment\r\nenabled him to estimate authors so different as (for instance) Massillon\r\nand Marivaux with singular felicity. But the greatest of the\r\nEncyclopaedists in this respect was unquestionably Diderot. While his\r\ncontemporaries, bent on innovation in politics and religion, accepted\r\nwithout doubt or complaint the narrowest, most conventional, and most\r\nunnatural system of literary criticism ever known, he, in his hurried\r\nand haphazard but masterly way, practically anticipated the views and\r\neven many of the _dicta_ of the Romantic school. Most of Diderot's\r\ncriticisms were written for Grimm's 'Leaves,' which thus acquired a\r\nvalue entirely different from and far superior to any that their nominal\r\nauthor could give them. Some of these short notices of current\r\nliterature are among the finest examples of the review properly so\r\ncalled, though in point of mere literary style and expression they\r\nconstantly suffer from Diderot's hurried way of setting down the first\r\nthing that came into his head in the first words that presented\r\nthemselves to clothe it. But everywhere there is to be perceived the\r\ncardinal principle of sound criticism--that a book is to be judged, not\r\naccording to arbitrary rules laid down _ex cathedra_ for the class of\r\nbooks to which it is supposed to belong, but according to the scheme of\r\nits author in the first place, and in the second to the general laws of\r\naesthetics; a science which, if the Germans named it, Diderot, by their\r\nown confession, did much to create. Even more remarkable in this respect\r\nthan his book-criticisms are his _Salons_, criticisms of the biennial\r\nexhibitions of pictures in Paris, also written for Grimm. There are nine\r\nof these, ranging over a period of twenty-two years, and they have\r\nserved as models for more than a century. Diderot did not adopt the old\r\nplan (as old as the Greeks) of mere description more or less elaborate\r\nof the picture, nor the plan of dilating on its merely technical\r\ncharacteristics, though, assisted by artist friends, he managed to\r\nintroduce a fair amount of technicalities into his writing. His method\r\nis to take in the impression produced by the painting on his mind, and\r\nto reproduce it with the associations and suggestions it has supplied.\r\nThus his criticisms are often extremely discursive, and some of his most\r\nvaluable reflections on matters at first sight quite remote from the\r\nfine arts occur in these _Salons_. Of drama Diderot had a formal theory\r\nwhich he illustrated by examples not quite so happy as his precepts.\r\nThis theory involved the practical substitution of what is called in\r\nFrench _drame_ for the conventional tragedy and comedy, and it brought\r\nthe French theatre (or would have brought it if it had been adopted,\r\nwhich it was not until 1830) much nearer to the English than it had\r\nbeen. Diderot was moreover an enthusiastic admirer of English novels,\r\nand especially of Richardson and Sterne, partly no doubt because the\r\nsentimentalism which characterised them coincided with his own\r\n_sensibilite_, but also (it is fair to believe) because of their freedom\r\nfrom the artificiality and the strict observance of models which\r\npervaded all branches of literature in France. Of poetry proper we have\r\nlittle formal criticism from Diderot. His own verses are few, and of no\r\nmerit, nor was the poetry of the time at all calculated to excite any\r\nenthusiasm in him. But the aesthetic tendency which in other ways he\r\nexpressed, and which he was the first to express, was that which, some\r\nforty years after his death, brought about the revival of poetry in\r\nFrance, through recurrence to nature, passion, truth, vividness, and\r\nvariety of sentiment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Newspapers of the Revolution.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Influence of Journalism.]\r\n\r\nSo long as the old _regime_ lasted journalism was naturally in a\r\ncondition of suppression, but from the beginning of the Revolution it\r\nassumed at once an important position in the state, and a position still\r\nmore important as a nursery of rising men of letters. At the time of the\r\noutbreak only two papers of importance existed, the already mentioned\r\n_Gazette de France_, and the _Journal de Paris_, in which Garat, Andre\r\nChenier, Roucher, and many other men of distinction, won their spurs.\r\n1789, however, saw the birth of numerous sheets, some of which continued\r\nalmost till our own days. The most important was the _Gazette Nationale_\r\nor _Moniteur Universel_, in which not merely Garat and La Harpe, but\r\nGinguene, a literary critic of talent and a republican of moderate\r\nprinciples, together with the future historian Lacretelle, and the comic\r\npoet, fabulist, and critic Andrieux, took part. Rivarol, Champcenetz,\r\nand Pelletier conducted the Royalist _Actes des Apotres_, Marat started\r\nhis ultra-republican _Ami du Peuple_, Camille Desmoulins the _Courier de\r\nBrabant_, Durozoy the _Gazette de Paris_. Barrere and Louvet, both\r\nnotorious, if not famous names, launched for the first time a paper with\r\na title destined to fortune, _Le Journal des Debats_; and Camille\r\nDesmoulins changed his oddly-named journal into one named more oddly\r\nstill, _Les Revolutions de France et de Brabant_. All these, and more,\r\nwere the growth of the single year 1789. The next saw the avowedly\r\nRoyalist _Ami du Roi_ of Royou, the atrocious _Pere Duchene_ of Hebert,\r\nthe cumbrously-named _Journal des Amis de la Constitution_, on which\r\nFontanes, Clermont-Tonnerre, and other future Bonapartists and\r\nConstitutionalists worked. In 1791 no paper of importance, except the\r\nshort-lived Girondist _Chronique du Mois_, appeared. In the next year\r\nmany Terrorist prints of no literary merit were started, and one,\r\nentitled _Nouvelles Politiques_, to which the veterans Suard and\r\nMorellet, with Guizot, a novice of the time to come, Lacretelle, Dupont\r\nde Nemours, and others, were contributors. In the later years of the\r\nrevolutionary period, the only important newspaper was what was first\r\ncalled the _Journal de l'Empire_, and at the end of Napoleon's reign the\r\n_Journal des Debats_, on which Fievee, Geoffroy, and many other writers\r\nof talent worked. In the early days of these various journals political\r\ninterests naturally engrossed them. But the literary tastes and\r\ninstincts of Parisians were too strong not to demand attention, and by\r\ndegrees the critical part of the newspaper became of importance. Under\r\nthe restoration this importance grew, and the result was the\r\n_Conservateur Litteraire_ and the _Globe_, in the former of which Victor\r\nHugo was introduced to the public, and in the latter Sainte-Beuve. This\r\nsudden uprise of journalism produced a remarkable change in the\r\nconditions of literary work, and offered chances to many who would\r\npreviously have been dependent on individual patronage. But so far as\r\nregards literature, properly so called, all its results which were worth\r\nanything appeared subsequently in books, and there is therefore no need\r\nto refer otherwise than cursorily to the phenomenon of its development.\r\nPut very briefly, the influence of journalism on literature may be said\r\nto be this: it opens the way to those to whom it might otherwise be\r\nclosed; it facilitates the destruction of erroneous principles; it\r\nassists production; and it interferes with labour and care spent over\r\nthe thing produced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chamfort.]\r\n\r\nFrom the crowd of clever writers whom this outburst of journalism found\r\nready to draw their pens in one service or the other, two names emerge\r\nas pre-eminently remarkable. Garat and Champcenetz were men of wit and\r\ningenuity, Andre Chenier was a great poet, and his brother, Marie\r\nJoseph, a man of good literary taste and master of an elegant style,\r\nLacretelle a painstaking historian, and many others worthy of note in\r\ntheir way. But Chamfort and Rivarol deserve a different kind of notice\r\nfrom this. They united in a remarkable fashion the peculiarities of the\r\nman of letters of the eighteenth century with the peculiarities of the\r\nman of letters of the nineteenth, and their individual merit was, though\r\ndifferent and complementary, almost unique. Chamfort was born in\r\nAuvergne, in 1741. He was the natural son of a person who occupied the\r\nposition of companion, and legally possessed nothing but his baptismal\r\nname of Nicholas. Like his rival, La Harpe, he obtained an exhibition at\r\none of the Paris colleges, and distinguished himself. After leaving\r\nschool he lived for a time by miscellaneous literature, and at last made\r\nhis way to society and to literary success by dint of competing for and\r\nwinning academic prizes. On the second occasion of his competition he\r\ndefeated La Harpe. Afterwards Madame Helvetius assisted him, and at last\r\nhe received from Chabanon (a third-rate man of letters, who may be most\r\nhonourably mentioned here) a small annuity which made him independent.\r\nIt is said that he married, and that his wife died six months\r\nafterwards. He was elected to the Academy, and patronised by all sorts\r\nof persons, from the queen downwards. But at the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution he took the popular side, though he could not continue long\r\nfaithful to it. In the Terror he was menaced with arrest, tried to\r\ncommit suicide, and died horribly mutilated in 1794. Chamfort's literary\r\nworks are considerable in bulk, but only a few of them have merit. His\r\ntragedies are quite worthless, his comedy, _La Jeune Indienne_, not much\r\nbetter. His verse tales exceed in licentiousness his models in La\r\nFontaine, but fall far short of them in elegance and humour. His\r\nacademic essays are heavy and scarcely intelligent. But his brief\r\nwitticisms and his short anecdotes and apophthegms hardly admit a rival.\r\nChamfort was a man soured by his want of birth, health, and position,\r\nand spoilt in mental development by the necessity of hanging on to the\r\ngreat persons of his time. But for a kind of tragi-comic satire, a\r\n_saeva indignatio_, taking the form of contempt of all that is exalted\r\nand noble, he has no equal in literature except Swift.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rivarol.]\r\n\r\nThe life of Rivarol was also an adventurous one, but much less sombre.\r\nHe was born about 1750, of a family which seems to have had noble\r\nconnections, but which, in his branch of it, had descended to\r\ninnkeeping. Indeed it is said that Riverot, and not Rivarol, was the\r\nname which his father actually bore. He himself, however, first assumed\r\nthe title of Chevalier de Parcieux, and then that of Comte de Rivarol.\r\nThe way to literary distinction in those days was either the theatre or\r\ncriticism, and Rivarol, with the acuteness which characterised him,\r\nknowing that he had no talent for the former, chose the latter. His\r\ntranslation (with essay and notes) of Dante is an extraordinarily clever\r\nbook, and his discourse on the universality of the French tongue, which\r\nfollowed, deserves the same description. It was not, however, in mere\r\ncriticism that Rivarol's forte lay, though he long afterwards continued\r\nto exhibit his acuteness in it by utterances of various kinds. In 1788\r\n(the year before the Revolution) he excited the laughter of all Paris,\r\nand the intense hatred of the hack-writers of his time, by publishing,\r\nin conjunction with Champcenetz, an _Almanach de nos Grands Hommes_, in\r\nwhich, by a mixture of fiction and fact, he caricatures his smaller\r\ncontemporaries in the most pitiless manner. When the Revolution broke\r\nout Rivarol took the Royalist side, and contributed freely to its\r\njournals. He soon found it necessary to leave the country, and lived for\r\nten years in Brussels, London, Hamburg, and Berlin, publishing\r\noccasionally pamphlets and miscellaneous works. He died at the Prussian\r\ncapital in 1801. Not only has Rivarol a considerable claim as a critic,\r\nand a very high position as a political pamphleteer, but he is as much\r\nthe master of the prose epigram as Chamfort is of the short anecdote.\r\nFollowing the example of his predecessors, he put many of his best\r\nthings in a treatise, _De l'Homme Intellectuel et Moral_, which, as a\r\nwhole, is very dull and unsatisfactory, though it is lighted up by\r\noccasional flashes of the most brilliant wit. His detached sayings,\r\nwhich are not so much _Pensees_ or maxims as conversational good things,\r\nare among the most sparkling in literature, and, with Chamfort's, occupy\r\na position which they keep almost entirely to themselves. It has been\r\nsaid of him and of Chamfort (who, being of similar talents and on\r\nopposite sides, were naturally bitter foes) that they 'knew men, but\r\nonly from the outside, and from certain limited superficial and\r\naccidental points of view. They knew books, too, but their knowledge was\r\ncircumscribed by the fashions of a time which was not favourable to\r\nimpartial literary appreciation. Hence their anecdotes are personal\r\nrather than general, rather amusing than instructive, rather showing the\r\nacuteness and ingenuity of the authors than able to throw light on the\r\nsubjects dealt with. But as mere tale-tellers and sayers of sharp things\r\nthey have few rivals.' It may be added that they complete and sum up the\r\nmerits and defects of the French society of the eighteenth century, and\r\nthat, in so far as literature can do this, the small extent of their\r\nselected works furnishes a complete comment on that society.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joubert.]\r\n\r\nContemporary with these two writers, though, from the posthumous\r\npublication of his works years after the end of his long life, he seems\r\nin a manner a contemporary of our own, was Joseph Joubert, the last\r\ngreat _Pensee_-writer of France and of Europe. Joubert's birthplace was\r\nMontignac, in Perigord, and the date of his birth 1754, three years\r\nafter that of Rivarol, and about twelve after that of Chamfort. He was\r\neducated at Toulouse, where, without taking regular orders, he joined\r\nthe Freres de la Doctrine Chretienne, a teaching community, and studied\r\nand taught till he was twenty-two years old. Then his health being, as\r\nit was all through his life, weak, he returned home, and succeeding\r\nbefore long to a small but sufficient fortune, he went to Paris. Here he\r\nbecame intimate with the second _philosophe_ generation (La Harpe,\r\nMarmontel, etc.), and is said to have for a time been an enthusiastic\r\nhearer of Diderot, the most splendid talker of that or any age. But\r\nJoubert's ideals and method of thought were radically different from\r\nthose of the _Philosophes_, and he soon found more congenial literary\r\ncompanions, of whom the chief were Fontanes and Chenedolle, while he\r\nfound his natural home in the salon of two ladies of rank and\r\ncultivation, Madame de Beaumont and Madame de Vintimille. Before long he\r\nmarried and established himself in Paris with a choice library, into\r\nwhich, it is said, no eighteenth-century writer was admitted. His health\r\nbecame worse and worse, yet he lived to the age of seventy, dying in\r\n1824. Fourteen years afterwards Chateaubriand, at the request of his\r\nwidow, edited a selection of his remains, and four years later still his\r\nnephew, M. de Raynal, produced a fuller edition.\r\n\r\nJoubert's works consist (with the exception of a few letters)\r\nexclusively of _Pensees_ and maxims, which rank in point of depth and of\r\nexquisite literary expression with those of La Rochefoucauld, and in\r\npoint of range above them. They are even wider in this respect than\r\nthose of Vauvenargues, which they also much resemble. Ethics, politics,\r\ntheology, literature, all occupy Joubert. In politics he is, as may be\r\nperhaps expected from his time and circumstances, decidedly\r\nanti-revolutionary. In theology, without being exactly orthodox\r\naccording to any published scheme of orthodoxy, Joubert is definitely\r\nChristian. In ethics he holds a middle place between the unsparing\r\nhardness of the self-interest school and the somewhat gushing manner of\r\nthe sentimentalists. But his literary thoughts are perhaps the most\r\nnoteworthy, not merely from our present point of view. All alike have\r\nthe characteristic of intense compression (he described his literary aim\r\nin the phrase 'tormented by the ambition of putting a book in a page, a\r\npage into a phrase, and a phrase into a word'), while all have the same\r\nlucidity and freedom from enigma. All are alike polished in form and\r\nstyle according to the best models of the seventeenth century; but\r\nwhereas study and reflection might have been sufficient to give Joubert\r\nthe material of his other thoughts, the wide difference between his\r\nliterary judgments and those of his time is less easily explicable. No\r\nfiner criticism on style and on poetry in the abstract exists than his,\r\nand yet his reading of poetry cannot have been very extensive. He is\r\neven just to the writers of the eighteenth century, whose manner he\r\ndisliked, and whose society he had abjured. He seems, indeed, to have\r\nhad almost a perfect faculty of literary appreciation, and wherever his\r\nsayings startle the reader it will generally be found that there is a\r\nsufficient explanation beneath. There is probably no writer in any\r\nlanguage who has said an equal number of remarkable things on an equal\r\nvariety of subjects in an equally small space, and with an equally high\r\nand unbroken excellence of style and expression. This is the intrinsic\r\nworth of Joubert. In literary history he has yet another interest, that\r\nof showing in the person of a man living out of the literary world, and\r\nfar removed from the operation of cliques, the process which was\r\ninevitably bringing about the great revolution of 1830.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Courier.]\r\n\r\nLike Joubert, Paul Louis Courier had a great dislike and even contempt\r\nfor the authors of the eighteenth century, but curiously enough this\r\ndislike did not in the least affect his theological or political\r\nopinions. He was born at Paris, in 1772, being the son of a wealthy man\r\nof the middle class. His youth was passed in the country, and he early\r\ndisplayed a great liking for classical study. As a compromise between\r\nbusiness, which he hated, and literature, of which his father would not\r\nhear, he entered the army in 1792. He served on the Rhine, and not long\r\nafter joining broke his leave in a manner rather unpleasantly resembling\r\ndesertion. His friends succeeded in saving him from the consequences of\r\nthis imprudence, and he served until Wagram, when he finally left the\r\narmy, again in very odd circumstances. He then lived in Italy (where his\r\npassion for the classics led him into an absurd dispute about an alleged\r\ninjury he had caused to a manuscript of Longus) until the fall of the\r\nEmpire. When he was forty-five years old he was known in literature only\r\nas a translator of classics, remarkable for scholarship and for careful\r\nmodelling of his style upon the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\r\nrather than upon the eighteenth. Although he had hitherto taken little\r\nactive part in politics, the so-called 'ideas of 89' had sunk deeply\r\ninto him. Impelled, not by any wide views on the future of the nation,\r\nbut apparently by the mere _bourgeois_ hatred of titles, old descent,\r\nand the other privileges of the aristocracy, he began a series of\r\npamphlets to the success of which there is no rival except that of the\r\nLetters of Junius, while Junius falls far short of Courier in intrinsic\r\nliterary merit. There are, indeed, few authors whose merit resides so\r\nwholly in their style and power of expression as Courier's. His thought\r\nis narrow in the extreme; even where its conclusions are just it rests\r\nrather on the jealousies of the typical _bourgeois_ than on anything\r\nelse. But in irony he has, with the exception of Pascal and Swift, no\r\nsuperior. He began by a _Petition aux Deux Chambres_. Then he\r\ncontributed a series of letters to _Le Censeur_, a reform journal; then\r\nhe published various pamphlets, usually signed 'Paul Louis, Vigneron,'\r\nand ostensibly addressed to his neighbours and fellow villagers. He had\r\nestablished himself on a small estate in Touraine, which he farmed\r\nhimself. But he was much in Paris, and his political writings made him\r\nacquainted with the prison of Sainte Pelagie. His death, in April 1825,\r\nwas singular, and indeed mysterious. He was shot, the murderer escaping.\r\nIt was suspected to be one of his own servants, to whom he was a harsh\r\nand unpopular master, and the suspicion was confirmed some years\r\nafterwards by the confession of a game-keeper. His _Simple Discours_\r\nagainst the presentation of Chambord to the Duc de Bordeaux, his _Livret\r\nde Paul Louis_, his _Pamphlet des Pamphlets_, are all models of their\r\nkind. Nowhere is the peculiar quality which is called in French\r\n_narquois_ displayed with more consummate skill. The language is at once\r\nperfectly simple and of the utmost literary polish, the arguments,\r\nwhether good or bad, always tellingly expressed. But perhaps he has\r\nwritten nothing better than the _Lettre a M. Renouard_, in which he\r\ndiscusses the mishap with the manuscript of Longus, and the letter to\r\nthe _Academie des Inscriptions_ on their refusal to elect him. The\r\nstyle of Courier is almost unique, and its merits are only denied by\r\nthose who do not possess the necessary organ for appreciating it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Senancour.]\r\n\r\nThis chapter may perhaps be most appropriately concluded by the notice\r\nof a singular writer who, although longer lived, was contemporary with\r\nCourier. Etienne Pivert de Senancour may be treated almost indifferently\r\nas a moral essayist, or as a producer of the peculiar kind of faintly\r\nnarrative and strongly ethical work which Rousseau had made fashionable.\r\nThe infusion of narrative in his principal and indeed only remarkable\r\nwork, _Obermann_, is however so slight, that he will come in best here,\r\nthough in his old age he wrote a professed novel, _Isabella_. Senancour\r\nwas born in 1770, his father being a man of position and fortune, who\r\nlost both at the Revolution. The son was destined for the Church, but\r\nran away and spent a considerable time in Switzerland, where he married,\r\nreturning to France towards the end of the century. He then published\r\ndivers curious works of half-sentimental, half-speculative reflection,\r\nby far the most important of which, _Obermann_, appeared in 1804. Then\r\nSenancour had to take to literary hack-work for a subsistence; but in\r\nhis later years Villemain and Thiers procured pensions for him, and he\r\nwas relieved from want. He died in 1846. _Obermann_ has not been ill\r\ndescribed by George Sand as a _Rene_ with a difference; Chateaubriand's\r\nmelancholy hero feeling that he could do anything if he would but has no\r\nspirit for any task, Senancour's that he is unequal to his own\r\naspirations. No brief epigram of this kind can ever fully describe a\r\nbook; but this, though inadequate, is not incorrect so far as it goes.\r\nThe book is a series of letters, in which the supposed writer delivers\r\nmelancholy reflections on all manner of themes, especially moral\r\nproblems and natural beauty. Senancour was in a certain sense a\r\n_Philosophe_, in so far that he was dogmatically unorthodox and\r\ndiscarded conventional ideas as to moral conduct; but he is much nearer\r\nRousseau than Diderot. Indeed, he sometimes seems to the reader little\r\nmore than an echo of the former, until his more distinctly modern\r\ncharacteristics (characteristics which were not fully or generally felt\r\nor reproduced till the visionary and discouraged generation of\r\n1820-1850) reappear. It is perhaps not unfair to say that the pleasure\r\nwith which this generation recognised its own sentiments in _Obermann_\r\ngave rise to a traditional estimate of the literary value of that book\r\nwhich is a little exaggerated. Yet it has considerable merit, especially\r\nin the simplicity and directness with which expression is given to a\r\nclass of sentiments very likely to find vent in language either\r\nextravagant or affected. Its form is that of a series of letters, dated\r\nfrom various places, but chiefly from a solitary valley in the Alps in\r\nwhich the hero lives, meditates, and pursues the occupations of\r\nhusbandry on his small estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The philosophe movement.]\r\n\r\nThe entire literary and intellectual movement of the eighteenth century\r\nis very often called the _philosophe_ movement, and the writers who took\r\npart in it _les philosophes_. The word 'philosopher' is, however, here\r\nused in a sense widely different from its proper and usual one.\r\n_Philosophie_, in the ordinary language of the middle and later\r\nseventeenth century, meant simply freethinking on questions of religion.\r\nThis freethinking, of which Saint-Evremond was the most distinguished\r\nrepresentative, involved no revolutionary or even reforming attitude\r\ntowards politics or practical affairs of any kind. As however the next\r\ncentury advanced, the character of French scepticism became altered.\r\nContact with English Deism gave form and precision to its theological or\r\nanti-theological side. The reading of Locke animated it against\r\nCartesianism, and the study of English politics excited it against the\r\nirresponsible despotism and the crushing system of ecclesiastical and\r\naristocratic privilege which made almost the entire burden of government\r\nrest on the shoulders least able to bear it. French 'philosophism' then\r\nbecame suddenly militant and practical. Toleration and liberty of\r\nspeculation in religion, constitutional government in politics, the\r\nequalisation of pressure in taxation, and the removal of privilege,\r\ntogether with reform in legal procedure, were the objects which it had\r\nmost at heart. In merely speculative philosophy, that is to say, in\r\nmetaphysics, it was much less active, though it had on the whole a\r\ntendency towards materialism, and by a curious accident it was for the\r\nmost part rigidly conservative in literary criticism. But it was eager\r\nin the cultivation of ethics from various points of view, and busy in\r\nthe study both of the philosophy of history, which may be said to date\r\nfrom that period, and of physical science, in which Newton took the\r\nplace of Locke as guide. The almost universal presence of this practical\r\nand reforming spirit makes it not by any means so easy to subdivide the\r\nbranches of literature, as is the case in the seventeenth century. La\r\nBruyere had said, in the days of acquiescence in absolutism, that to a\r\nFrenchman 'Les grands sujets sont defendus,' meaning thereby theology\r\nand politics. The general spirit of the eighteenth century was a\r\nvigorous denial of this, and an eager investigation into these 'grands\r\nsujets.' This spirit made its appearance in the most unexpected\r\nquarters, and in the strangest forms. It converted (in the hands of\r\nVoltaire) the stiffest and most conventional form of drama ever known\r\ninto a pamphlet. It insinuated polemics under the guise of history, and\r\nmade the ponderous and apparently matter-of-fact folios of a Dictionary\r\nof Arts and Manufactures the vehicles of arguments for reform. It\r\noverflowed into every department of literary occupation. Some of the\r\nchief prose manifestations of this spirit have been discussed and\r\narranged in the two previous chapters under the head of history and\r\nessay writing. The rest will be dealt with here. A certain distinction\r\nof form, though it is often rather arbitrary than real, renders such a\r\nsubdivision possible, while it is desirable in the interest of\r\nclearness. It will be noticed that while the attack is voluminous and\r\nmanifold, the defence is almost unrepresented in literature. This is one\r\nof the most remarkable facts in literary history. In England, from which\r\nthe _philosophe_ movement borrowed so much, the Deists had not only not\r\nhad their own way in the literary battle, but had been beaten all along\r\nthe line by the superior intellectual and literary prowess of the\r\ndefenders of orthodoxy. The case in France went otherwise and almost by\r\ndefault. The only defender of orthodoxy whose name has survived in\r\nliterature--for Freron, despite his power, was little more than a\r\nliterary critic--is the Abbe Guenee. In so singular a state was the\r\nchurch of France that scarcely a single preacher or theologian, after\r\nMassillon's death in 1742, could challenge equality with even third- or\r\nfourth-rate men of letters; while, after the death of the Chancellor\r\nd'Aguesseau in 1751, no layman of eminence can be named until Joseph de\r\nMaistre, nearly half a century later, who was at once a considerable\r\nwriter and a declared defender of religion. Indeed no small proportion\r\nof the enemies of ecclesiasticism were actually paid and privileged\r\nmembers of the Church itself. Thus little opposition, except that of\r\nsimple _vis inertiae_, was offered to the new views and the crusade by\r\nwhich they were supported. This crusade, however, had two very different\r\nstages. The first, of which the greatest representatives are Montesquieu\r\nand in a way Voltaire himself, was critical and reforming, but in no way\r\nrevolutionary; the second, of whom the Encyclopaedists are the\r\nrepresentatives, was, consciously or unconsciously, bent on a complete\r\nrevolution. We shall give an account first of the chief representatives\r\nof these two great classes of the general movement, and then of those\r\noffshoots or schools of that movement which busied themselves with the\r\nspecial subjects of economics, ethics, and metaphysics, as distinguished\r\nfrom general politics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Montesquieu.]\r\n\r\nCharles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu et de la Brede, was born at\r\nthe _chateau_, which gave him the last-named title, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Bordeaux, on the 18th of January, 1689. His family was not of the\r\noldest, but it had, as he tells us, some two or three centuries of\r\nproved _noblesse_ to boast of, and had been distinguished in the law. He\r\nhimself was destined for that profession, and after a youth of laborious\r\nstudy became councillor of the parliament of Bordeaux in 1714, and in a\r\nyear or two president. In 1721 he produced the _Lettres Persanes_, and\r\nfour years later the curious little prose poem called the _Temple de\r\nGnide_. Some objection was made by the minister Fleury, who was rigidly\r\northodox, to the satirical tone of the former book in ecclesiastical\r\nmatters, but Montesquieu was none the less elected of the Academy in\r\n1728. He had given up his position at the Bordeaux Parlement a few years\r\nbefore this, and set out on an extensive course of travel, noting\r\nelaborately the manners, customs, and constitution of the countries\r\nthrough which he passed. Two years of this time were spent in England,\r\nfor which country, politically speaking, he conceived a great\r\nadmiration. On his return to France he lived partly in Paris, but\r\nchiefly at his estate of La Brede, taking an active interest in its\r\nmanagement, and in the various occupations of a country gentleman, but\r\nalso working unceasingly at his masterpiece, the _Esprit des Lois_.\r\nThis, however, was not published for many years, and was long preceded\r\nby the book which ranks second in importance to it, the _Grandeur et\r\nDecadence des Romains_, 1734. This was Montesquieu's first serious work,\r\nand it placed him as high among serious writers as the _Lettres\r\nPersanes_ had among lighter authors. The _Esprit des Lois_ itself did\r\nnot appear till 1748. Montesquieu, whose life was in no way eventful,\r\nlived for some years longer, dying in Paris on the 10th of February,\r\n1755. Besides the works mentioned he had written several dialogues and\r\nother trifles, a considerable number of _Pensees_, and some articles for\r\nthe earlier volumes of the Encyclopaedia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lettres Persanes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gradeur et Decadence des Romains]\r\n\r\nMontesquieu probably deserves the title of the greatest man of letters\r\nof the French eighteenth century, the superior versatility and more\r\nsuperficial brilliancy of Voltaire being compensated in him by far\r\ngreater originality and depth of thought. His three principal works\r\ndeserve to be considered in turn. The _Lettres Persanes_, in which the\r\nopinions of a foreigner on French affairs are given, is not entirely\r\noriginal in conception; the idea of the vehicle being possibly suggested\r\nby the _Amusements Divers_ of Dufresny the comic author. The working\r\nout, however, is entirely Montesquieu's, and was followed closely enough\r\nby the various writers, who, with Voltaire and Goldsmith at their head,\r\nhave adopted a similar medium for satire and criticism since. It is not\r\ntoo much to say that the entire spirit of the _philosophe_ movement in\r\nits more moderate form is contained and anticipated in the _Lettres\r\nPersanes_. All the weaknesses of France in political, ecclesiastical,\r\nand social arrangements are here touched on with a light but sure hand,\r\nand the example is thus set of attacking 'les grands sujets.' From a\r\nliterary point of view the form of this work is at least as remarkable\r\nas the matter. Voltaire himself is nowhere more witty, while Montesquieu\r\nhas over his rival the indefinable but unquestionable advantage of\r\nwriting more like a gentleman. There is no single book in which the\r\nadmirable capacity of the French language for jesting treatment of\r\nserious subjects is better shown than in the _Lettres Persanes_.\r\nMontesquieu's next important work was of a very different character. The\r\n_Considerations sur les Causes de la Grandeur et de la Decadence des\r\nRomains_ is an entirely serious work. It does not as yet exhibit the\r\nmagnificent breadth of view and the inexhaustible fertility of\r\nexplanation which distinguish the _Esprit des Lois_, but it has been\r\nwell regarded as a kind of preliminary exercise for that great work.\r\nMontesquieu here treats an extensive but homogeneous and manageable\r\nsubject from the point of view of philosophical history, after a method\r\nwhich had been partially tried by Bossuet, and systematically arranged\r\nby Vico in Italy, but which was not fully developed till Turgot's time.\r\nThat is to say, his object is not merely to exhibit, but to explain the\r\nfacts, and to explain them on general principles applicable with due\r\nmodifications to other times and other histories. Accordingly, the style\r\nof the _Grandeur et Decadence_ is as grave and dignified as that of the\r\n_Lettres Persanes_ is lively and malicious. It is sometimes a little too\r\nsententious in tone, and suffers from the habit, induced probably by\r\n_Pensee_-writing, of composing in very brief paragraphs. But it is an\r\nexcellent example of its kind, and especially remarkable for the extreme\r\nclearness and lucidity with which the march and sequence of events in\r\nthe gross is exhibited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Esprit des Lois.]\r\n\r\nThe _Esprit des Lois_ is, however, a far greater book than either of\r\nthese, and far more original. The title may be thought to be not\r\naltogether happy, and indeed rather ambiguous, because it does not of\r\nitself suggest the extremely wide sense in which the word law is\r\nintended to be taken. An exact if cumbrous title for the book would be\r\n'On the Relation of Human Laws and Customs to the Laws of Nature.' The\r\nauthor begins somewhat formally with the old distinction of politics\r\ninto democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy. He discusses the principles\r\nof each and their bearings on education, on positive law, on social\r\nconditions, on military strength, offensive and defensive, on individual\r\nliberty, on taxation and finance. Then an abrupt return is made from the\r\neffects to the causes of constitutions and polity. The theory of the\r\ninfluence of physical conditions, and especially of climate, on\r\npolitical and social institutions--a theory which is perhaps more than\r\nany other identified with the book--receives special attention, and a\r\nsomewhat disproportionate space is given to the question of slavery in\r\nconnection with it. From climate Montesquieu passes to the nature of\r\nthe soil, as in its turn affecting civil polity. He then attacks the\r\nsubject of manners and customs as distinct from laws, of trade and\r\ncommerce, of the family, of jurisprudence, of religion. The book\r\nconcludes with an elaborate examination of the feudal system in France.\r\nThroughout it the reader is equally surprised at the varied and exact\r\nknowledge of the author, and at his extraordinary fertility in general\r\nviews. This fertility is indeed sometimes a snare to him, and leads to\r\nrash generalisation. But what has to be remembered is, that he was one\r\nof the pioneers of this method of historical exploration, and that\r\nhundreds of principles which, after correction by his successors, have\r\npassed into general acceptance, were discovered, or at least enunciated,\r\nby him for the first time. Nothing is more remarkable in Montesquieu,\r\nand nothing more distinguishes him from the common run of his somewhat\r\nself-satisfied and short-sighted successors, than the steady hold he\r\nkeeps on the continuity of history, and his superiority to the shallow\r\nview of his day (constantly put forward by Voltaire), according to which\r\nthe middle ages were a dark period of barbarism, the study of which\r\ncould be of no use to any one but a mere curiosity hunter. Montesquieu\r\ntoo, almost alone of his contemporaries, had a matured and moderate plan\r\nof political and social reform. While some of them indulged in an idle\r\nand theoretical Republicanism, and others in the old unpractical\r\n_frondeur_ spirit, eager to pull down but careless about building up,\r\nMontesquieu had conceived the idea of a limited monarchy, not identical\r\nwith that of England, but in many ways similar to it; an ideal which in\r\nthe first quarter of the eighteenth century might have been put in\r\npractice with far better chance of success than in the first quarter of\r\nthe nineteenth. The merely literary merits of this great book are equal\r\nto its philosophical merits. The vast mass of facts with which the\r\nauthor deals is selected with remarkable judgment, and arranged with\r\nremarkable lucidity. The style is sober, devoid of ornament, but\r\nadmirably proportioned and worked out. There are few greater books, not\r\nmerely in French but in literature, than the _Esprit des Lois_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Voltaire.]\r\n\r\nWith Voltaire the case is very different. Very many of his innumerable\r\nworks have directly philosophical titles, but no one of them is a work\r\nof much interest or merit. His 'Philosophic Letters,' 1733, published\r\nafter his return from England, and the source of much trouble to him,\r\nare the lively but not very trustworthy medium of a contrast between\r\nEnglish liberty and toleration and French arbitrary government. His\r\n'Discourses on Man,' and other verse of the same kind, are\r\nverse-philosophy of the class of Pope's. The pompously named 'Treatise\r\non Metaphysics,' 1734, is very much the same in substance if not in\r\nform. The remarks on Pascal's _Pensees_ are unimportant contributions to\r\nthe crusade against superstition; the Philosophical Dictionary, 1764, is\r\na heterogeneous collection of articles with the same object. The _Essai\r\nsur les Moeurs_, 1756, composed not improbably in rivalry with\r\nMontesquieu, contains much acute reflection on particulars, but is\r\ninjured by the author's imperfect information as to the subjects of\r\nwhich he was treating, by his entirely unphilosophical contempt for the\r\n'Dark Ages,' and indeed by the absence of any general conception of\r\nhistory which can be called philosophical. Voltaire's real importance,\r\nhowever, in connection with the _philosophe_ movement is to be found,\r\nnot in the merit or value of any one of his professedly philosophical\r\nbooks, but in the fact that all his works, his poems, his plays, his\r\nhistories, his romances, his innumerable flying essays and papers of all\r\nsorts, were invariably saturated with its spirit, and helped to\r\ncommunicate it to others. It cannot be said that Voltaire had any clear\r\nconception of the object which he wished to attain, except in so far as\r\nthe famous watchword 'Ecrasez l'Infame' goes. This means not, as has\r\nbeen erroneously thought, 'crush Christianity,' but 'crush persecuting\r\nsuperstition.' He was by no means in favour of any political reform,\r\nexcept as far as private rights were concerned. He would have liked the\r\nexaggerated political privileges of the Church (which enabled it to\r\npersecute dissidents, and inflicted on laymen an unfair share of\r\ntaxation) to be revoked, the cruel and irrational procedure of the\r\nFrench tribunals to be reformed, Church lands to be in great part\r\nsecularised, and so forth; but he never seems to have faced the\r\nnecessity of connecting these reforms with a radical alteration of the\r\nwhole system of government. The sharp point of his ridicule was,\r\nhowever, always at the service of the aggressive party, especially for\r\nwhat he had most at heart, the overthrow of dogmatic and traditional\r\ntheology and ecclesiasticism. For this purpose, as has been said\r\nalready, he was willing to make, and did make, all his works, no matter\r\nof what kind (except a few scattered writings on mathematics and\r\nphysics, pure and simple, in which he took great interest), into more or\r\nless elaborate pamphlets, and to put at the service of the movement his\r\ngreat position as the head of French and indeed of European letters. His\r\nhabitual inaccuracy, and the inferiority of his mind in strictly logical\r\nfaculty and in commanding range of view, disabled him from really\r\nserious contributions to philosophy of any kind. The curious mixture of\r\ndefects and merits in this great writer is apt to render piecemeal\r\nnotice of him, such as is necessitated by the plan of this book,\r\napparently unfavourable. But no literary historian can take leave of\r\nVoltaire with words of intentional disfavour. The mere fact that it has\r\nbeen necessary to take detailed notice of him in every one of the last\r\nsix chapters, is roughly indicative of his unequalled versatility. But,\r\nversatile as he is, there is perhaps no department of his work, save\r\nserious poetry and criticism, in which from the literary point of view\r\nhe fails to attain all but the highest rank.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Encyclopaedia.]\r\n\r\nMontesquieu and Voltaire were, as has been said, precursors rather than\r\nmembers of the _philosophe_ group proper, which is identified with the\r\nEncyclopaedia, and to this group it is now time to come. The history of\r\nthis famous book is rather curious. The English Cyclopaedia of Ephraim\r\nChambers had appeared in 1727. About fifteen years after its publication\r\na translation of it was offered to and accepted by the French\r\nbookseller, Le Breton. But Le Breton was not satisfied with a bare\r\ntranslation, and wished the book to be worked up into something more\r\nextensive. He applied to different men of letters, and finally to\r\nDiderot, who, enlisting the Chancellor d'Aguesseau in the plan,\r\nobtaining privilege for the enlarged work, and mustering by degrees a\r\nstaff of contributors which included almost every man of letters of any\r\nrepute in France, succeeded in carrying it out. The task was anything\r\nbut a sinecure. It occupied nearly twenty years of Diderot's life; it\r\nwas repeatedly threatened and sometimes actually prohibited; and\r\nD'Alembert (Diderot's principal coadjutor, and in fact co-editor)\r\nactually retired from it in disgust at the obstacles thrown in their\r\nway. The book so produced was by no means a mere pamphlet or\r\ncontroversial work, though many of the articles were made polemical by\r\nthose to whom they were entrusted. The principal of its contributors\r\nhowever--Voltaire himself was one--became gradually recognised as\r\nrepresenting the criticism of existing institutions, many of which, it\r\nmust be confessed, were so bad at the time that simple examination of\r\nthem was in itself the severest censure. It becomes necessary,\r\ntherefore, to mention the names and works of the most remarkable of this\r\ngroup who have not found or will not find a place elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diderot.]\r\n\r\nDenis Diderot was born at Langres, on the 15th October, 1713. He was\r\nbrilliantly successful at school, but on being required to choose a\r\nprofession rejected both church and law. It appears, however, that he\r\nstudied medicine. His father, a man of affectionate temper but strong\r\nwill, refused to support him unless he chose a regular mode of life, and\r\nDiderot at once set up for himself and attempted literature. Not much is\r\nauthentically known of his life till, in 1743, he married; but he seems\r\nto have lived partly by taking pupils, partly by miscellaneous literary\r\nhack-work. After his marriage his household expenses (and others)\r\nquickened his literary activity, and before long he received, in the\r\neditorship of the Encyclopaedia, a charge which, though ridiculously ill\r\npaid and very laborious, practically secured him from want for many\r\nyears, while it gave him a very important position. He made many\r\nfriends, and was especially intimate with the Baron d'Holbach, a rich\r\nand hospitable man, and a great adept in chemistry and atheism. Before\r\nthis Diderot had had some troubles, being even imprisoned at Vincennes\r\nfor his _Essai sur les Aveugles_, 1749. Besides his Encyclopaedia work\r\nDiderot was lavish in contributing, often without either remuneration or\r\nacknowledgment of any kind, to the work of other men, and especially to\r\nthe correspondence by which his friend Grimm kept the sovereigns of\r\nGermany and Russia informed of the course of things in Paris. The most\r\nremarkable of these contributions--criticisms of literature and\r\nart--have been noticed elsewhere, as have Diderot's historical and\r\nfictitious productions. As he grew old his necessities were met by a\r\nhandsome act of Catherine of Russia, who bought his library, left him\r\nthe use of it, and gave him a pension nominally as payment for his\r\ntrouble as caretaker. He made, in 1773, a journey to St. Petersburg to\r\npay his thanks, and on his return stayed for some time in Holland. He\r\ndied in Paris in 1784. Diderot's miscellaneous works are, like\r\nVoltaire's, penetrated by the _philosophe_ spirit, but it is less\r\nprominent, owing to his greater acquaintance with the individual matters\r\nwhich he handled. His contributions to definite philosophical literature\r\nare not unimportant. He began by an 'Essay on Merit and Virtue,' 1745,\r\nimitated from Shaftesbury, and by some more original _Pensees\r\nPhilosophiques_. These pieces were followed by _La Promenade du\r\nSceptique_, written somewhat in the fashion of Berkeley's _Alciphron_,\r\nand by some minor treatises, the most important of which are the\r\n_Lettres sur les Sourds et Muets_, and by the already mentioned _Lettre\r\nsur les Aveugles_, which led to his imprisonment, with some 'Thoughts on\r\nthe Interpretation of Nature.' A singular and characteristic book\r\ncontaining not a few acute but fantastic ideas is _Le Reve de\r\nD'Alembert_, which, like an elaborate criticism on Helvetius' _De\r\nl'Homme,_ was not printed during Diderot's life. The _Essai sur les\r\nRegnes de Claude et de Neron_ was one of the latest of Diderot's works,\r\nand is a kind of historico-philosophical disquisition. The last piece of\r\nany importance which is included in the philosophical works of Diderot\r\nis an extensive scheme for a Russian university.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of Diderot's philosophical works are the same as the\r\ncharacteristics of those other works of his which have been noticed, and\r\nhis general position as a writer may well be considered here. There has\r\nseldom been an author who was more fertile in ideas. It is impossible to\r\nname a subject which Diderot has not treated, and hardly possible to\r\nname one on which he has not said striking and memorable things. The\r\npeculiarity of his mind was, that it could adjust itself, with hardly\r\nany effort, to any subject presented to it, grasp that subject and\r\nexpress thoughts on it in a novel and effective manner. He had moreover,\r\nwhat some other men of his century, notably Voltaire, lacked, a vast\r\nsupply of positive information on the subjects with which he dealt, and\r\nan entire independence of conventional points of view in dealing with\r\nthem. This independence was in some respects pushed to an unfortunate\r\nlength, exposing him (whether deservedly or not, is an exceedingly\r\ndifficult point to resolve) to the charge of atheism, and (beyond all\r\ndoubts deservedly) to the charge of wilful disregard of the accepted\r\ndecencies of language. Another and very serious fault, arising partly\r\nfrom temperament and partly from circumstances, was the want of needful\r\npains and deliberation which characterises most of Diderot's work. That\r\nwork is extremely voluminous, and even as it is, we have not anything\r\nlike the whole of it in a collected form. Indeed, by far the larger part\r\nwas never given to the world by the author himself in any deliberate or\r\nfinished shape, and much of what he did publish was the result of mere\r\nimprovisation. The consequence is, that Diderot is accused, not without\r\ntruth, of having written good passages, but no good book, and that a\r\nfull appreciation of his genius is only to be obtained by a most\r\nlaborious process of wading through hundreds and thousands of pages of\r\nvery inferior work. The result of that process, however, is never likely\r\nto be doubtful in the case of competent examiners. It is the conviction\r\nthat Diderot ranks in point of originality and versatility of thought\r\namong the most fertile thinkers of France, and in point of felicity and\r\nidiosyncrasy of expression, among the most remarkable of her writers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D'Alembert.]\r\n\r\nHis coadjutor during the earlier part of his great work was a man\r\ncuriously different from himself. Diderot was a rapid and careless\r\nwriter, devoted to general society and conversation, interested in\r\neverything that was brought to his notice, passionate, unselfish,\r\nfrequently extravagant. Jean le Rond d'Alembert (who was really an\r\nillegitimate son of Madame de Tencin by an uncertain father) was an\r\nextraordinarily careful writer, a man of retired habits, reserved,\r\nself-centred and phlegmatic. He was born in 1717, was exposed on the\r\nsteps of a church, but was brought up carefully by a foster-mother of\r\nthe lower classes, to whom he was consigned by the authorities, and had\r\na not insufficient annuity settled upon him by his supposed father. He\r\nwas educated at the College Mazarin, and early showed great aptitude for\r\nmathematics, in which equally with literature he distinguished himself\r\nin after years. He was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences as\r\nearly as at the age of four-and-twenty. After he had joined Diderot, he\r\nwrote a preliminary discourse for the Encyclopaedia--a famous and\r\nadmirable sketch of the sciences--besides many articles. Of these, one\r\non Geneva brought the book into more trouble than almost any other\r\ncontribution, though D'Alembert was equally moderate as a thinker and as\r\na writer. D'Alembert, as has been said, retired from the work after this\r\nstorm, being above all things solicitous of peace and quietness. His\r\nrefusals of the offers of Frederick II. in 1752 to go to Berlin as\r\nPresident of the Academy, and of Catherine II. to undertake, at what was\r\nthen an enormous salary, the education of the Grand Duke Paul, have been\r\nvariously taken as evidence of his disinterestedness, and of his shrewd\r\ndislike to possibly false positions, and the chance of such experiences\r\nas those of Voltaire. In his later life he and Mademoiselle de\r\nLespinasse, as has been mentioned, kept house together. He died shortly\r\nbefore Diderot, in 1783. Perhaps his best literary works are his already\r\nmentioned Academic _Eloges_, or obituaries on important men of letters\r\nand science. D'Alembert contributed to the movement exactness of thought\r\nand precision of style, but his influence was more purely intellectual\r\nthan that of any other member of the _philosophe_ group.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rousseau.]\r\n\r\nThe connection of Rousseau with the Encyclopaedia itself was brief and\r\nnot important. Yet it is here that his personal and general literary\r\ncharacter and achievements may be most conveniently treated. Jean\r\nJacques Rousseau was born at Geneva, on the 28th of June, 1712, of a\r\nfamily which had emigrated from France during the religious troubles.\r\nHis father was a watchmaker, his mother died when he was very young. His\r\neducation was not exactly neglected, but he went to no regular school,\r\nwhich, considering his peculiarities, was perhaps a misfortune. After\r\nbeing introduced to the law and to engraving, in both cases with ill\r\nsuccess, he ran away and practically continued a vagabond to the end of\r\nhis life. He served as a footman, was an inmate of a kind of\r\nproselytising almshouse at Turin, and went through many odd adventures,\r\nfor which there is the dubious authority of his strange _Confessions_.\r\nWhen he was just of age, he was taken in by Madame de Warens, a Savoyard\r\nlady of birth and position, who had before been kind to him. With her he\r\nlived for some time, chiefly at Les Charmettes, near Chambery. But being\r\nsuperseded in her good graces, he went to Lyons, where he lived by\r\nteaching. Thence he went to Paris, having little to depend on but an\r\nimperfect knowledge of music. In 1741 he was attached to the French\r\nEmbassy at Venice under M. de Montaigu, but (as he did all through his\r\nlife) he quarrelled in some way with his patron, and returned to Paris.\r\nHere he became intimate with Diderot, Grimm, and all the _philosophe_\r\ncircle, especially with Madame d'Epinay. She established him in a\r\ncottage called the Hermitage with his companion Therese le Vasseur,\r\nwhose acquaintance he had made in Paris, and whom he afterwards married.\r\nThe extraordinary quarrel which took place between Rousseau and Diderot\r\nhas been endlessly written about. It need only be said that Rousseau\r\nshowed his usual temper and judgment, that Diderot was to all appearance\r\nquite guiltless, and that the chief fault lay elsewhere, probably with\r\nGrimm. For a time the Duke of Luxembourg protected him, then he was\r\nobliged, or thought himself obliged, to go into exile. Marshal Keith,\r\nGovernor of Neufchatel for the King of Prussia, received and protected\r\nhim, with the inevitable result that Rousseau considered it impossible\r\nto continue in this as in every other refuge. David Hume was his next\r\ngood angel, and carried him to England in 1766. But the same drama\r\nrepeated itself, as it did subsequently with the Prince de Conti and\r\nwith Madame d'Enghien. Rousseau's last protector was M. de Girardin, who\r\ngave him, after he had lived in Paris in comparative quiet for several\r\nyears, a home at Ermenonville in 1778. He did not outlive the year,\r\ndying in a somewhat mysterious fashion, which has never been fully\r\nexplained, on the 2nd of July.\r\n\r\nRousseau was a man of middle age before he produced any literary work of\r\nimportance. He had in his youth been given to music, and indeed\r\nthroughout his life the slender profits of music copying were almost\r\nhis only independent source of income. His knowledge of the subject was\r\nfar from scientific, but he produced an operetta which was not\r\nunsuccessful, and, but for his singular temperament, he might have\r\nfollowed up the success. His first literary work of importance was a\r\nprose essay for the Dijon Academy on the subject of the effects of\r\ncivilisation on society. Either of his own motion, or at the suggestion\r\nof Diderot, Rousseau took the apparently paradoxical line of arguing\r\nthat all improvements on the savage life had been curses rather than\r\nblessings, and he gained the prize. In 1755 his _Discours sur l'Origine\r\nde l'Inegalite_ appeared at Amsterdam; in 1760 his famous novel _Julie_,\r\nand in 1764 _Emile_, both of which have been spoken of already. Between\r\nthe two appeared the still more famous and influential _Contrat Social_.\r\nOf the other works of Rousseau published during his lifetime, the most\r\nfamous, perhaps, was his letter to D'Alembert on the subject of the\r\nintroduction of theatrical performances into Geneva, a characteristic\r\nparadox which made a bitter enemy of the most powerful of French men of\r\nletters. Besides these, the _Reveries d'un Promeneur Solitaire_, the\r\n_Lettres de la Montagne_, and above all, the unique _Confessions_, have\r\nto be reckoned. The last, like several of Rousseau's other works, did\r\nnot appear till after his death.\r\n\r\nOf all the writers mentioned in this chapter the influence of Rousseau\r\non literature and on life was probably the largest. He was the direct\r\ninspirer of the men who made the French Revolution, and the theories of\r\nhis _Contrat Social_ were closer at the root of Jacobin politics than\r\nany other. His fervid declamation about equality and brotherhood, and\r\nhis sentimental republicanism, were seed as well suited to the soil in\r\nwhich they were sown as Montesquieu's reasoned constitutionalism was\r\nunsuited to it. Rousseau, indeed, if the proof of the excellence of\r\npreaching is in the practice of the hearers, was the greatest preacher\r\nof the century. He denounced the practice of putting infants out to\r\nnurse, and mothers began to suckle their own children; he recommended\r\ninstruction in useful arts, and many an _emigre_ noble had to thank\r\nRousseau for being able to earn his bread in exile; he denounced\r\nspeculative atheism, urging the undogmatic but emotional creed of his\r\n_Vicaire Savoyard_, and the first wave of the religious reaction was\r\nset going to culminate in the Catholic movement of Chateaubriand and\r\nLamennais. But in literature itself his influence was quite as powerful.\r\nHe was not, indeed, the founder of the school of analysis of feeling in\r\nthe novel, but he was the populariser of it. He was almost the founder\r\nof sentimentalism in general literature, and he was absolutely the first\r\nto make word-painting of nature an almost indispensable element of all\r\nimaginative and fictitious writing both in prose and poetry. Some of his\r\ncharacteristics were taken up in quick succession by Goethe in Germany,\r\nby Bernardin de St. Pierre and Chateaubriand in France. Others were for\r\nthe time less eagerly imitated, and though Madame de Stael and her lover\r\nBenjamin Constant did something to spread them, it was reserved for the\r\nRomantic movement to develop them fully. It was singular, no doubt, and\r\nthis is not the place to undertake the explanation of the singularity,\r\nthat Rousseau, who detested most of the conclusions, and almost all the\r\nmethods of the Encyclopaedists, should be counted in with them, and\r\nshould have undoubtedly helped in the first place to accomplish their\r\nresult. But such is the case. His peculiar literary characteristics are\r\nperhaps better exhibited in the _Confessions_ and in the miscellaneous\r\nworks, than in either of the novels. The _Contrat Social_ is a very\r\nremarkable piece of pseudo-argument. It is felt from the first that the\r\nwhole assumption on which it reposes is historically false and\r\nphilosophically absurd. Yet there is an appearance of speciousness in\r\nthe arguments, an adroit mixture of logic and rhetoric, of order and\r\nmethod, which is exceedingly seductive. The _Confession du Vicaire\r\nSavoyard_, with many passages allied to it in the smaller works, has,\r\ndespite the staleness of the language (which was hackneyed by a thousand\r\nempty talkers during the Revolution), not a little dignity and\r\npersuasive force. But it is in the _Confessions_ that the literary power\r\nof the author appears at its fullest. Never, perhaps, was a more\r\nmiserable story of human weakness revealed, and the peculiar thing is\r\nthat Rousseau does not limit his exhibitions of himself to exhibitions\r\nof engaging frailty. The acts which he admits are in many cases\r\nindescribably base, mean, and disgusting. The course of conduct which he\r\nportrays is at its best that of a man entirely destitute of governing\r\nwill, petulant, often positively ungrateful, always playing into the\r\nhands of the enemies whom his hallucinations supposed to exist, and\r\nfrustrating the efforts of the friends whom he allows himself, if only\r\nfor a time, to have possessed. Yet the narrative and dramatic skill with\r\nwhich all this is presented is so great, that there is hardly room for a\r\nsense of repulsion which is merged in interest, not necessarily\r\nsympathetic interest, but still interest. Of the feeling for natural\r\nbeauty, which is everywhere present in these remarkable works, it is\r\nenough to say that in French prose literature, it may almost be said in\r\nthe prose literature of Europe, it was entirely original. Part of\r\nRousseau's devotion to nature arose no doubt from his moody and retiring\r\ntemperament, which led him to rejoice in anything rather than the\r\nsociety of his fellow men. But this would not of itself have given him\r\nthe literary skill with which he expresses these feelings. It is not so\r\nmuch in set descriptions of particular scenes as in slight occasional\r\nthoughts, embodying the emotions experienced at the sight of a flower, a\r\nlake-surface, a mountain side, a forest glade, that this mastery is\r\nshown. Yet of the more elaborate passages of this kind in other writers\r\nfew can surpass the best things of the _Nouvelle Heloise_, the\r\n_Confessions_, and the _Reveries_. There is nothing novel to readers of\r\nthe present day in such things, though they are seldom done so happily.\r\nBut to the readers of Rousseau's day they were absolutely novel. It is\r\nin this that the main literary importance of Rousseau consists, though\r\nit must not be forgotten that he is in many ways a master of French\r\nprose. His contemporaries made use of his Genevan origin to find fault\r\nwith his style; but with a few insignificant exceptions the criticism\r\nhas no foundation. It has been very frequently renewed, and sometimes\r\nwith little better reason, in the case of Swiss authors.\r\n\r\nRound these chiefs of the Encyclopaedic movement were grouped many lesser\r\nmen, some of whom will be most conveniently noticed here. Marmontel,\r\nMorellet, and Saint-Lambert, whose chief importance lay in other\r\ndirections, were contributors. The Chevalier de Jaucourt, a man of no\r\noriginal power, but a hack-writer of extraordinary aptitude, took\r\nconsiderable part in it. There were others, however, who, partly within\r\nand partly without the range of the Encyclopaedia, had no small share in\r\nthe promotion of what has been called the _philosophe_ movement. Some\r\nof these have found their place under the head of Essayists. There is,\r\nhowever, one remarkable division, which must be treated here--the\r\ndivision of economists--before we pass to the philosophers properly so\r\ncalled, who either continued the metaphysics of Locke in a directly\r\nmaterialist sense, or who, restraining themselves to sensationalism,\r\nmade the most of the English philosopher in that direction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political Economists. Vauban, Quesnay, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe science of 'Political Arithmetic,' as it was first called in\r\nEngland, had a somewhat earlier birth in France than in England itself.\r\nIt is remarkable that the complete establishment of the royal authority\r\nunder Louis XIV. preceded but by a very few years the examination of the\r\neconomic condition of the kingdom by unsparing examiners. The two chief\r\nof these, both of whom fell into disgrace for their doings, were the\r\ngreat engineer Vauban, and the great theologian Fenelon. The latter was\r\nattracted to the subject chiefly by compassion for the sufferings of the\r\npeople, and expressed his opinion in a manner more rhetorical than\r\nscientific. Vauban's course was naturally different. In the later years\r\nof his life he set himself to the collection of statistical facts as to\r\nthe economic condition of France, and the result was the two books\r\ncalled _Oisivetes de M. de Vauban_ and _La Dime Royale_, 1707. The\r\nformer of these contained the facts, the latter the deduction from them,\r\nwhich was, to put it briefly, that the existing system of privilege,\r\nexemption, and irregular taxation was a loss to the Crown, and a torment\r\nto the people. Vauban received the reward of his labours, attention to\r\nwhich would probably have prevented the French Revolution, in the shape\r\nof the royal displeasure, and nothing came immediately of his\r\ninvestigations. In the next century, however, a regular sect of\r\npolitical economists arose. They had, indeed, been preceded by an\r\neccentric man of letters, the Abbe de Saint-Pierre, who occupied his\r\nlife in propounding Utopian schemes of universal peace and general\r\nprosperity. But the first and greatest of the economists properly so\r\ncalled was Quesnay. The extreme misery of the common people attracted\r\nhis attention, and set him upon calculating the causes and remedies of\r\nperiodical failings. He was himself a frequent contributor to the\r\nEncyclopaedia. Many others of the _philosophe_ set occupied themselves\r\nwith these and similar subjects, notably the Abbes Morellet and Galiani.\r\nThe former was a man of a certain vigour (Voltaire called him 'L'Abbe\r\nMord-Les'), the latter has been noticed already. His _Dialogue sur le\r\nCommerce des Bles_ acquired for him a great reputation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turgot.]\r\n\r\nVery many writers, among them the father of the great Mirabeau (in his\r\ncurious and able, though unequal and ill-proportioned _Ami des Hommes_),\r\nattacked economical subjects at this time. But Turgot, though not\r\nremarkable for the form of his writings, was the most original and\r\ninfluential writer of the liberal school in this department. He was a\r\nNorman by birth, and of a good legal family. He was born in 1727, and,\r\nbeing destined for the Church, was educated at the Sorbonne. Turgot,\r\nhowever, shared to the full the _philosophe_ ideas of the time as to\r\ntheological orthodoxy, and did not share the usual _philosophe_ ideas as\r\nto concealment of his principles for comfort's sake. He refused to take\r\norders, turning his attention to the law and the Civil Service instead\r\nof the Church. His family had considerable influence, and at the age of\r\ntwenty-four he was appointed intendant of Limoges, a post which gave him\r\npractical control of the government of a large, though barren and\r\nneglected, province. His achievements in the way of administrative\r\nreform here were remarkable, and, had they been generally imitated,\r\nmight have brought about a very different state of things in France.\r\nAfter the death of Louis XV., he was recommended by Maurepas to a far\r\nmore important office, the controllership of finance. Here, too, he did\r\ngreat things; but his attack on the privileged orders was ill-seconded,\r\nand, after holding his post for about two years, he had to resign,\r\npartly, it is true, owing to a certain unaccommodating rigidity of\r\ndemeanour, which was one of his least amiable characteristics. He died\r\nin 1781. Turgot's literary work is not extensive, and it is not\r\ndistinguished by its style. It consists of certain discourses at the\r\nSorbonne, of memoirs on various political occasions, of some letters on\r\nusury, of articles in the Encyclopaedia, of which the most noteworthy is\r\none on endowments, etc. All are remarkable as containing the germs of\r\nwhat may be accepted as the modern liberal doctrines on the various\r\npoints of which they treat, while the second Sorbonne discourse is\r\nentitled to the credit of first clearly announcing the principle of the\r\nphilosophy of history, the doctrine, that is to say, that human progress\r\nfollows regular laws of development, certain sets of causes invariably\r\ntending to bring about certain sets of results.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condorcet.]\r\n\r\nWith the name of Turgot that of Condorcet is inseparably connected, and\r\nthough far less important in the history of thought, it is perhaps more\r\nprominent in the history of literature, for the pupil and biographer (in\r\nboth of which relations Condorcet stood to Turgot) was, though a far\r\nless original and vigorous thinker, a better writer than his master and\r\nsubject. Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, styled Marquis de Condorcet,\r\nwas born in 1743, near St. Quentin, and early distinguished himself both\r\nin mathematics and in the belles lettres. He became Secretary of the\r\nAcademy in 1777, and he afterwards wrote the Life of Turgot, whose\r\nmethod of dealing with economic questions (a more practical and less\r\nabstract one than that of the earlier economists) he had already\r\nfollowed. He took a considerable part in the French Revolution, serving\r\nboth in the Legislative Assembly and in the Convention. In the latter he\r\nbecame identified with the Girondist party, and shared their troubles.\r\nHis best known work, the _Esquisse des Progres de l'Esprit Humain_, was\r\nwritten while he was a fugitive and in concealment. He was at last\r\ndiscovered and arrested, but the day after he was found dead in his\r\nprison at Bourg la Reine, having apparently poisoned himself (March,\r\n1794). Condorcet's works are voluminous, and partake strongly of the\r\n_philosophe_ character. He is not remarkable for originality of thought,\r\nand may indeed be said to be for the most part a mere exponent of the\r\ncurrent ideas of the second stage of the _philosophe_ movement. But his\r\nstyle has great merits, being clear, forcible, and correct, suffering\r\nonly from the somewhat stereotyped forms, and from the absence of\r\nflexibility and colour which distinguish the later eighteenth century in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Volney.]\r\n\r\nOne more remarkable name deserves to be mentioned in this place as the\r\nlast of the _Philosophes_ proper, that is to say, of those writers who\r\ncarried out the general principles of the Encyclopaedist movement with\r\nless reference to specialist departments of literature than to a certain\r\ngeneral spirit and tendency. This was Constantin Francois de\r\nChasseboeuf, Comte de Volney, by which latter name he is generally\r\nknown. Volney was born in 1757, at Caron, in Anjou, and was educated at\r\nAngers, and afterwards at Paris. He studied both medicine and law, but\r\nhaving a sufficient fortune, practised neither. In 1783 he set out on\r\nhis travels and journeyed to the East, visiting Egypt and Syria; an\r\naccount of which journey he published four years later. When he returned\r\nto France he was from the beginning a moderate partisan of the\r\nRevolution, and, like most such persons, he was arrested during the\r\nTerror, though he escaped with no worse fate than imprisonment.\r\nImmediately after Thermidor, Volney published his most celebrated work,\r\n_Les Ruines_, a treatise on the rise and fall of empires from a general\r\nand philosophical point of view. Shortly after this he visited the\r\nUnited States, whence he returned in 1798. He had known Napoleon in\r\nearly days, and on the establishment of the Consulate he was appointed a\r\nsenator; nor was his resignation accepted, though it was tendered when\r\nBonaparte assumed the crown. His countship was Napoleonic, but he was\r\nalways an opponent of the emperor's policy. Accordingly, after the\r\nRestoration, he was nominated by Louis XVIII. as a member of the new\r\nHouse of Peers. He died in 1820. Besides the books already noticed he\r\npublished some studies in ancient history and many miscellaneous works,\r\nincluding a project of a universal language. Volney was, as has been\r\nsaid, the last of the _philosophes_, exhibiting, long after a new order\r\nof thought had set in, their acute but negative and one-sided criticism,\r\ntheir sterile contempt of Christianity and religion generally, their\r\nsomewhat theoretic acceptance of generalisations on philosophy and\r\nhistory, and of large plans for dealing with politics and ethics. As a\r\ntraveller his observation is accurate and his expression vivid; as a\r\nphilosophical historian his acuteness is perhaps not sufficiently\r\naccompanied by real breadth of view.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: La Mettrie]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Helvetius]\r\n\r\nBetween these philosophers, in the local and temporary sense of the\r\nword, who dealt only with what would now be called the sociological side\r\nof philosophy in its bearings on politics, religion, ethics, and\r\neconomics, and the strictly philosophical school of Condillac and his\r\nfollowers, a small but very influential sect of materialists, who were\r\nyet not purely philosophical materialists, has to be considered. Three\r\nmembers of this school have importance in literature--La Mettrie,\r\nHelvetius, and Holbach. La Mettrie was a native of Britanny: he entered\r\nthe medical service of the French army, acquired a speedy reputation for\r\nheterodoxy and disorderly living, and fled for shelter to the general\r\npatron of heterodox Frenchmen, Frederick of Prussia; at whose court he\r\ndied, at a comparatively early age, it is said in consequence of a\r\npractical joke. La Mettrie's chief work is a paradoxical exercise in\r\nmaterialist physics called _L'Homme-Machine_, in which he endeavours to\r\nprove the purely automatic working of the human frame, and the absence\r\nof any mind in the spiritualist sense. This he followed by a similar but\r\nless original work, called _L'Homme-Plante_, and by some other minor\r\npublications. La Mettrie was a very unequal thinker and writer, but he\r\nhas, as Voltaire (who disliked him) expressed it, _traits de flamme_\r\nboth in thought and style. Claude Adrian Helvetius was of Swiss descent,\r\nand of ample fortune. Born in 1715, he was appointed to the high post of\r\nFarmer-General when he was little more than twenty-three; but he did not\r\nhold this appointment very long, and became Chamberlain to the Queen. He\r\nwas very popular in society, and was of a benevolent and philanthropic\r\ndisposition, though he seems to have got into trouble at his country\r\nseat of Vore by excessive game preserving. He married, in 1751, the\r\nbeautiful Mademoiselle de Ligneville, who was long afterwards one of the\r\nchief centres of literary society in Paris. In 1758 his book _De\r\nl'Esprit_ appeared, and made a great sensation, being condemned as\r\nimmoral, and burnt by the hangman. Helvetius subsequently travelled in\r\nEngland and Germany, dying in 1771. A second treatise, _De l'Homme,_\r\nwhich appeared posthumously, is much inferior to _De l'Esprit_ in\r\nliterary merit. It was even more fiercely assailed than its predecessor,\r\nand Diderot himself, the leader of the more active section of the\r\n_philosophe_ party, wrote an elaborate refutation of it, which, however,\r\nhas only recently been published. The book _De l'Esprit_ is wanting in\r\ndepth, and too anecdotic in style for a serious work of philosophy,\r\nthough this very characteristic makes it all the more amusing reading.\r\nIt endeavours to make out a theory of morals based on what is called the\r\nselfish system; and it was the naked manner in which this selfish system\r\nof ethics, and the materialist metaphysics which it implies, are\r\nmanifested in the book which gave occasion to its ill repute. As a mere\r\nwork of literature, however, it is well, and in parts even brilliantly\r\nwritten, and amid much that is desultory, inconclusive, and even\r\ndemonstrably unsound, views of extreme shrewdness and originality on\r\nsocial abuses and inconsistencies are to be found.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Systeme de la Nature.]\r\n\r\nNone of the writers hitherto mentioned made open profession of atheism,\r\nand it is doubtful whether even Diderot deserves the appellation of a\r\nconsistent atheist. There was, however, a large anti-theistic school\r\namong the _philosophes_, which increased in numbers and strength towards\r\nthe outbreak of the Revolution. The most striking work by far of this\r\nschool (which included Damilaville, Naigeon, and a few other names of no\r\ngreat distinction in literature) was the _Systeme de la Nature_, which\r\nappeared in 1770. This remarkable book, which even Voltaire and\r\nFrederick II. set themselves seriously to refute, contains a complete\r\nmaterialist system in metaphysics and theology. It represents the\r\nexistence of God as a mere creation of the superstition of men, unable\r\nto assign a cause for the evils under which they suffer, and inventing a\r\nsupernatural entity to satisfy themselves. The book (to consider its\r\nliterary style only) is extremely unequal, passages of remarkable vigour\r\nalternating with long and dreary tracts of inconclusive and monotonous\r\ndeclamation. It appeared under the name of a dead man, Mirabaud, a\r\nperson of some slight and chiefly official name in science and letters.\r\nIt is, however, believed, if not certainly known, to be the work of the\r\nBaron d'Holbach (who unquestionably wrote various other books of a\r\nsimilar tendency), with the assistance of divers of his friends, and\r\nespecially of Diderot. The _Systeme_ is a very singular production,\r\nanimated by a kind of fanatical, and in parts almost poetical aspiration\r\nafter the annihilation of all supernatural belief, which is hardly to be\r\nfound elsewhere except in Lucretius. It had great influence, though\r\nthat influence was one of repulsion as well as of conversion, and it may\r\nbe said to be, up to the present day, the furthest step taken in the\r\ndirection of philosophical as opposed to political Nihilism. It should,\r\nhowever, be observed that in parts there is a strong political tinge\r\nobservable in it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condillac.]\r\n\r\nIn all this century of so-called philosophy, France possessed hardly\r\nmore than one really eminent and considerable metaphysician. This was\r\nEtienne Bonnot de Condillac, brother of the Abbe de Mably, who was born\r\nin 1715, and died in 1780. Condillac himself was an abbe, and possessing\r\na sufficient benefice, he lived for the most part quietly upon it, and\r\ntook no part in the political, or even the literary life of the times.\r\nIn 1746 he published his _Essai sur l'Origine des Connoissances\r\nHumaines_; in 1749 his _Traite des Systemes_, a work critical rather\r\nthan constructive; and in 1754 the _Traite des Sensations_, his\r\nprincipal work, which completes his theory. The influence of Locke was\r\nthe most powerful single influence in the _philosophe_ movement of\r\nFrance, and Condillac took up Locke's work at exactly the point where\r\nhis master had faltered. He set to work to show with great plausibility\r\nthat, according to Lockeian principles, the addition of ideas of\r\nreflection to ideas of sensation is unsustainable, and that all ideas\r\nwithout exception are merely transformed sensations. One of the\r\nillustrations which he used to support his views, that of a statue\r\nsupposed to be endowed with a single sense, and successively developing\r\nfirst the others, and then the powers usually classed as reflection, is\r\nfamous in the history of philosophy. It concerns us only as giving an\r\ninstance of the method of Condillac, which is remarkable for vividness\r\nand adaptation to the ordinary comprehension. Unlike the style of Locke\r\nhimself, Condillac's style is not in the least slovenly, but polished\r\nand lucid, excellently suited to such a public as that of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, which was at once intelligent enough to understand, and\r\neducated enough to demand, finish of manner in discussing abstract\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nAfter Condillac the history of philosophy in France during the rest of\r\nthe period is of no great interest to literature. He himself was\r\ncontinued and represented chiefly by Destutt de Tracy. The reaction\r\nagainst the extreme idealist and materialist constructions of Locke\r\nrespectively, which had been brought about in England by Reid and\r\nStewart, acquired in the last years of the eighteenth century, and the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth, a considerable following in France. Its\r\nchiefs were Maine de Biran, Royer Collard (who also obtained reputation\r\nas an orator and parliamentary politician), and Jouffroy. They belong,\r\nhowever, rather to the history of philosophy than to that of literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joseph de Maistre.]\r\n\r\nAfter this long list of writers who advocated, more or less openly,\r\nrevolution in matters political and religious, but especially in the\r\nlatter, two authors who with Chateaubriand, but in a definitely\r\nphilosophical manner, set the example of reaction, and who to a great\r\nextent indicated the lines which it was to follow, must be mentioned.\r\nThese are Joseph de Maistre, and Louis de Bonald. Joseph, Count de\r\nMaistre, was born at Chambery, in 1753, of a noble Savoyard family,\r\nwhich is said to have come originally from Languedoc. His father held\r\nimportant employments in the duchy, and Joseph himself entered its civil\r\nservice. When, after the French Revolution, Savoy was invaded, and in a\r\nshort time annexed, he returned to Lausanne, and there wrote\r\n_Considerations sur la France_, his first work of importance. For some\r\nyears he was employed at Turin in the administration of such of his\r\ncontinental dominions as were left to the King of Sardinia; and then,\r\nafter the practical annexation of Piedmont, he held a similar employ in\r\nthe island of Sardinia itself. At the beginning of the present century,\r\nhe was sent to St. Petersburg to plead the cause of his master. Here he\r\nremained till after the overthrow of Napoleon, and wrote, though he did\r\nnot publish, most of his books. In 1816 he returned to Turin, and died a\r\nfew years afterwards--in 1821. The three chief works of Joseph de\r\nMaistre are _Du Pape_, 1817, _De l'Eglise Gallicane_, and the unfinished\r\n_Soirees de St. Petersbourg_. The two first compose a complete treatise\r\non the power and position of the pope in relation both to the temporal\r\nand to the ecclesiastical form of national government. The author is the\r\nmost uncompromising of ultramontanes. According to him the pope is the\r\nsource of all authority on earth, and temporal princes are little more\r\nthan his delegates. Except in relation to religious error, Joseph de\r\nMaistre is not hostile to a certain ordered measure of liberty accorded\r\nby their rulers to peoples and individuals. But, strongly impressed by\r\nthe social and moral, as well as the political and religious anarchy\r\nbrought about first by the _philosophe_ movement, and then by the\r\nRevolution, he sees the only chance of rescue in the establishment of a\r\nhierarchy of government culminating in that from which there is no\r\nappeal, the single authority of the pope. He is thus a legitimist with a\r\ndifference. The _Soirees de St. Petersbourg_, which are unfinished and\r\nnot entirely uniform in plan, deal nominally with the providential\r\ngovernment of the world, but diverge to a large number of subjects. It\r\nis in this book that the author develops the kind of modified terrorism\r\nwhich is often, though not altogether justly, considered to be his chief\r\ncharacteristic, eulogising the executioner as the foundation of society.\r\n\r\nJoseph de Maistre is unquestionably one of the greatest thinkers and\r\nwriters of the eighteenth century. Paradoxical and strained as his\r\nsystem frequently appears, it is rigorously logical. An ordered\r\ntheocracy seems to him the only polity capable of giving peace and true\r\nprosperity to the world, and he shapes all his theories so as to fit in\r\nwith this central conception. On detached subjects his thoughts are\r\nalways vigorous, and often strikingly original. His reading was great,\r\nand his skill in polemics of the very highest. No one possesses in\r\nlarger measure the art of hostile criticism without descending to actual\r\nabuse. These merits of themselves imply purely literary accomplishments,\r\nclearness, distinctness, forcible expression, in a rare kind and degree.\r\nBut Joseph de Maistre is more than this as a writer. He possesses,\r\nthough he only occasionally exercises it, a brilliant faculty of\r\nrhetoric. His phrase is more than merely clear and forcible; it has a\r\npeculiar incisiveness and sharpness of outline which impress it on the\r\nmemory, while, sparing as he is of ornament, his rare passages of\r\ndescription and fancy have great merit. The surest testimony to his\r\nvalue is the fact that, though both in his own day and since by far the\r\nlarger number of writers and thinkers have held views more or less\r\nopposed to his, no one whose opinion is itself of the least importance\r\nhas ever spoken of him without respect and even admiration. Those who,\r\nlike Lamartine, qualify their admiration with a certain depreciation,\r\nshow inability to recognise fully the beauty of strength undisguised by\r\nconventional elegance and grace of form.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bonald.]\r\n\r\nLouis Gabriel Ambroise, Vicomte de Bonald, who is usually named with\r\nJoseph de Maistre as the leader of the Catholic-monarchist reaction, was\r\na weaker thinker, and a writer of less accomplishment, though in both\r\nrespects he has perhaps been somewhat unfairly criticised. Born at\r\nMilhaud, in the district of Rouergue, in 1754, he discharged various\r\ncivil and military employments in his native province during his youth;\r\nwas elected in 1790 member of the Departmental Assembly, but emigrated\r\nnext year; served in Conde's army, and then established himself at\r\nHeidelberg. His first work was seized by the Directory, but he returned\r\nto France soon afterwards, and was not molested. He published a good\r\ndeal during the first years of the century, and, like many other\r\nroyalists, received overtures from Napoleon through Fontanes. These he\r\ndid not exactly reject, but he availed himself of them very sparingly.\r\nThe Restoration, on the contrary, aroused him to vigour. It was owing to\r\nhim chiefly that the law of divorce was altered. He entered the Academy,\r\nand in 1823 was made a peer; an honour which he resigned at the\r\nrevolution of July. He died in 1840.\r\n\r\nBonald's principal work is his _Legislation Primitive_. He also wrote a\r\nbook on divorce, and a considerable number of miscellaneous political\r\nand metaphysical works. His chief subjects of discussion were, first,\r\nthe theory of the revelation of language; and secondly, the theory of\r\ncausality: in respect of both of which he combated the materialist\r\nschool of the eighteenth century. In politics Bonald was a thoroughgoing\r\nlegitimist and monarchist of the patriarchal school. Although an\r\northodox and devout Catholic, he does not lay the stress on the temporal\r\npower of the pope that the author of _Du Pape_ does. With him the king\r\nis the immediate instrument of God in governing. He has been accused of\r\nreducing things too much to formulas, and of repeating his formulas too\r\noften. But this itself was in great part the effect of reaction against\r\nthe vague declamation of the _philosophes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC WRITERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the sciences divide and subdivide themselves more and more, the works\r\nwhich treat of them become less and less the subject of strictly\r\nliterary history. Besides this truth, it is necessary to remember the\r\nfact that a large number of treatises, scientific in subject, were in\r\nthe eighteenth century professedly popularised and addressed to\r\nunprofessional audiences. Fontenelle, D'Alembert, and many other authors\r\nalready mentioned, were _savants_, but their manner of handling their\r\nsubjects was far from being strictly or wholly scientific. Yet there\r\nremain a certain number of writers, who, their reputation being derived\r\nwholly or mainly from their treatment of subjects of science and\r\nerudition, are better dealt with separately.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Buffon.]\r\n\r\nThe head and chief of these is beyond all question Buffon. George Louis\r\nLeclerc, who was made Count de Buffon by Louis XV., was born at Montbard\r\nin Burgundy, on Sept. 7, 1707; his father was a man of wealth and of\r\nposition in the _noblesse de robe_. Buffon was destined for the law, but\r\nearly showed an inclination towards science. He became acquainted with a\r\nyoung English nobleman, Lord Kingston, who with his tutor was taking the\r\nthen usual grand tour, and was permitted by his father to accompany him\r\nthrough France and Italy, and to visit England. On the English language\r\nhe spent considerable pains, translating Newton, Hales, and Tull the\r\nagriculturist. When he returned to France he devoted himself to\r\nscientific experiments, and in 1739 he was appointed intendant or\r\ndirector of the Jardin du Roi, which practically gave him command of the\r\nnational collections in zoology, botany, and mineralogy. He was thus\r\nenabled to observe and experiment to his heart's content, and to collect\r\na sufficient number of facts for his vast Natural History. Buffon,\r\nhowever, was only half a man of science. He was at least as anxious to\r\nwrite pompous descriptions and to indulge in showy hypotheses, as to\r\nconfine himself to plain scientific enquiry. He accordingly left the\r\nmain part of the hack-work of his _Histoire Naturelle_ (a vast work\r\nextending to thirty-six volumes) to assistants, of whom the chief was\r\nDaubenton, himself contributing only the most striking and rhetorical\r\npassages. The book was very remarkable for its time, as the first\r\nattempt since Pliny at a collection of physical facts at once\r\nexhaustive, and in a manner systematised, and though there was much\r\nalloy mixed with its metal, it was of real value. Buffon's life was\r\nlong, and he outlived all the other chiefs of the _philosophe_ party (to\r\nwhich in an outside sort of fashion he belonged), dying at Paris in the\r\nyear 1788. It is perhaps easier to condemn Buffon's extremely rhetorical\r\nstyle than to do justice to it. To a modern reader it too frequently\r\nseems to verge on the ridiculous, and to do more than verge on the\r\ntrivial. It is necessary, however, to take the point of view of the\r\ntime. Buffon found natural science in a position far below that assigned\r\nto literary erudition and to the arts in general estimation. He also\r\nfound it customary that these arts and letters should be treated in\r\npompous _eloges_. His real interest in science led him to think that the\r\nshortest way to raise it was to treat it in the same manner, and there\r\nis little doubt that his method was effectual in its degree. It is\r\nperhaps curious that he, the author of the phrase 'Le style c'est\r\nl'homme,' should have so completely exemplified it. Many authors of\r\nelaborate prose have been perfectly simple and unpretentious in private\r\nlife. Buffon was as pompous and inflated as his style. Anecdotes\r\nrespecting him are numerous; but perhaps the most instructive is that\r\nwhich tells how, having heard some one speak of the style of\r\nMontesquieu, he asked, 'Si M. de Montesquieu avait un style?' It is\r\nneedless to say that from any just standpoint, even of purely literary\r\ncriticism, the hollow pomp of the _Histoire Naturelle_ sinks into\r\ninsignificance beside the nervous and solid yet graceful vigour of the\r\n_Esprit des Lois_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lesser Scientific Writers.]\r\n\r\nNo single scientific writer equals the fame of Buffon, but there are not\r\na few who deserve to be mentioned after him. Pierre Louis Moreau de\r\nMaupertuis, a Breton by birth, who was a considerable mathematician and\r\na physicist of more eccentricity than merit, owes most of his literary\r\ncelebrity to the patronage of Frederick the Second, and the pitiless\r\nraillery of Voltaire, who quarrelled with him on his visit to Berlin,\r\nwhere Maupertuis was president of the Academy. Maupertuis' chief\r\nscientific performance was his mission to Lapland to determine the\r\nmeasurement of a degree of longitude in 1736. Of this mission he\r\npublished an account. At the same time a similar mission was sent to\r\nSouth America under La Condamine, who underwent considerable hardship,\r\nand, like Maupertuis, published his adventures when he came back.\r\nMathematics were indeed the favourite study of the time. Clairaut, De\r\nMoivre, Euler, Laplace, all wrote in French, or belonged to\r\nFrench-speaking and French-descended races; while Voltaire's own\r\ncontributions to the reception of Newton's principles in France were not\r\nsmall, and his beloved Madame du Chatelet was an expert mathematician.\r\nVoltaire also devoted much attention to chemistry, which was the special\r\nsubject of such of the Baron d'Holbach's labours as were not devoted to\r\nthe overthrow of Christianity. It was not, however, till the eve of the\r\nRevolution that the most important discoveries in this science were made\r\nby Lavoisier and others. The Empire was a much more favourable time for\r\nscience than for literature. Bonaparte was fond of the society of men of\r\nscience, and pleased by their usual indifference to politics. Monge,\r\nBerthollet, Champollion, were among his favourites. Geoffroy St. Hilaire\r\nand Cuvier were, however, the chief men of science of this period, and\r\nCuvier at least had no mean command of a literary style sufficient for\r\nhis purposes. His chief work of a literary-scientific character was his\r\ndiscourse _Sur les Revolutions de la Surface du Globe_. Earlier than\r\nthis the physician Cabanis, in his _Rapports de Physique et de Morale_,\r\ncomposed a semi-materialist work of great excellence according to\r\neighteenth-century standards. Bichat's _La Vie et la Mort_, the work of\r\nan anatomist of the greatest talent, who died young, also belongs to\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Voyages and Travels.]\r\n\r\nSome contributions to letters were also made by the voyages of discovery\r\nwhich formed part of the general scientific curiosity of the time. The\r\nchief of them is that of Bougainville, 1771, which, giving the first\r\nclear notion to Frenchmen of the South Sea Islands, had a remarkably\r\nstimulating effect on the imaginations of the _philosophe_ party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Linguistic and Literary Study.]\r\n\r\nIn works of pure erudition more directly connected with literature, the\r\nage was less fruitful than its immediate predecessor. The laborious\r\nstudies of the Benedictines, however, continued. One work of theirs,\r\nimportant to our subject, was projected and in part carried out under\r\nthe superintendence chiefly of Dom Rivet. This was the _Histoire\r\nLitteraire de la France_--a mighty work, which, after long interruption\r\nby the Revolution and other causes, was taken up again, and has\r\nproceeded steadily for many years, though it has not yet reached the\r\nclose of the middle ages. This work was part, and a very important part,\r\nof a revival of the study of old French literature. The plan of the\r\nBenedictines led them at first into the literature of mediaeval Latin.\r\nBut the works of the Trouveres, of their successors in the fourteenth\r\nand fifteenth centuries, and of the authors of the French Renaissance,\r\nalso received attention, scattered at first and desultory, but gradually\r\nco-ordinating and regulating itself. La Monnoye, Lenglet-Dufresnoy, the\r\nPresident Bouhier, and many others, collected, and in some cases edited,\r\nthe work of earlier times. The Marquis de Paulmy began a vast\r\n_Bibliotheque des Romans_, for which the Comte de Tressan undertook the\r\nmodernising and reproducing of all the stories of chivalry. Tressan, it\r\nis true, had recourse only to late and adulterated versions, but his\r\nwork was still calculated to spread some knowledge of what the middle\r\nages had actually done in matter of literature. La Curne de Sainte\r\nPalaye devoted himself eagerly to the study of the language, manners,\r\nand customs of chivalry. Barbazan collected the specially French product\r\nof the Fabliau, and, with his successor Meon (who also edited the _Roman\r\ndu Renart_), provided a great corpus of lighter mediaeval literature for\r\nthe student to exercise himself upon. By degrees this revived literature\r\nforced itself upon the public eye, and before the Republic had given\r\nplace to the Empire, it received some attention at the hands of\r\nofficial teachers of literature who had hitherto scorned it. M. J.\r\nChenier, Daunou, and others, undertook the subject, and made it in a\r\nmanner popular; while towards the extreme end of the present period\r\nRaynouard and Fauriel added the subject of Provencal literature to that\r\nof the literature of Northern France, and helped to propagate the study\r\nabroad as well as at home.\r\n\r\nIn the older fields the renown of France for purely classical\r\nscholarship diminished somewhat as compared with the days of Huet,\r\nMenage, Dacier, and the Delphin classics. The principal work of\r\nerudition was either directed towards the so-called philosophy in its\r\nwide sense of enquiry and speculation into politics and manners, or else\r\nto mathematics and physics. The Benedictines confined themselves for the\r\nmost part to Christian antiquity. Yet there were names of weight in this\r\ndepartment, such as the President Henault, a writer something after the\r\nfashion of Fontenelle, but on classical subjects; and the President de\r\nBrosses, also an archaeologist of merit, but chiefly noteworthy as having\r\nbeen among the founders of the science which busies itself with the\r\nmanners and customs of primitive and prehistoric man[291].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[291] I owe to M. Scherer the indication of a misprint of '_des_\r\nBrosses' for 'de' in former editions. M. Scherer says that I 'have never\r\nheard' of the President's pleasant _Lettres sur l'Italie_, because I do\r\nnot mention them. He also says that what I do say of De Brosses is\r\n'egalement surprenante pour ce qu'elle avance et par ce qu'elle omet.' I\r\nam, therefore, justified in supposing that M. Scherer 'has never heard'\r\nof the _Lettres sur Herculanum_, the _Navigations aux Terres Australes_,\r\nor the _Culte des Dieux Fetiches_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century was pre-eminently the century of academic\r\nliterature in France: far more so than the seventeenth, which had seen\r\nthe foundation of the Academie Francaise. The word 'academy' in this\r\nsense was an invention of the Italian humanists, prompted by their\r\nPlatonic, or perhaps by their Ciceronian, studies. Academies, or\r\ncoteries of men of letters who united love of society with the\r\ncultivation of literature, became common in Italy during the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and from Italy were translated to France. The famous society,\r\nwhich now shares with the original school of Plato the honour of being\r\ndesignated in European language as 'The Academy' without distinguishing\r\nepithet, was originally nothing but one of these coteries or clubs,\r\nwhich met at the house of the judicious and amiable, but not\r\nparticularly learned, Conrart. Conrart's influence with Richelieu, the\r\ndesire of the latter to secure a favourable tribunal of critics for his\r\nown literary attempts, or (to be generous) his foresight and his\r\nappreciation of the genius of the French language, determined the\r\nCardinal to establish this society. It was modestly endowed, and was\r\ncharged with the duty of composing an authoritative Dictionary of the\r\nFrench literary language; a task the slow performance of which has been\r\na stock subject of ridicule for two centuries and a half. The Academy,\r\nthough it suffered some vicissitudes in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic\r\nperiod, has survived all changes, and is virtually one of the most\r\nancient existing institutions of France. But, though it from the\r\nbeginning enjoyed royal and ministerial favour, it was long before it\r\ncollected a really representative body of members, and it was subjected\r\nat first to a good deal of raillery. One of Saint Evremond's early\r\nworks was a _Comedie des Academistes_; while one of the most polished\r\nand severe of his later prose critical studies is a 'Dissertation on the\r\nword \"Vaste,\"' in which the tendency of the Academy to trifling\r\ndiscussions (the curse of all literary societies), the literary\r\nindolence of its members, and the pedagogic limitations of its critical\r\nstandards, are bitterly, though most politely, ridiculed. It did itself\r\nlittle good by lending its name to be the cover for Richelieu's jealousy\r\nof the _Cid_, though there is more justice in its _examen_ of that\r\nfamous play than is sometimes supposed. But the institution was\r\nthoroughly germane to the nature, tastes, and literary needs of the\r\nFrench people, and it prospered. Conrart was a tower of strength to it;\r\nand in the next generation the methodical and administrative talents of\r\nPerrault were of great service, while it so obviously helped the design\r\nof Louis XIV. to play the Augustus, that a tradition of royal patronage,\r\nwhich was not afterwards broken, was established. The greatest blots on\r\nthe Academy were the almost unavoidable servility which rewarded this\r\npatronage, and the private rivalries and cliques which have occasionally\r\nkept some of the greatest names of French literature out of its lists.\r\nMoliere and Diderot are the most shining examples among these, but many\r\nothers keep them company. Nevertheless, by the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury at least, it became the recognised aim of every Frenchman of\r\nletters to belong to the 'forty geese that guard the Capitol' of French\r\nliterature, as Diderot, not quite a disinterested witness, called them.\r\nThroughout the eighteenth century their power was supreme. Competition\r\nfor the various academic prizes was, in the infancy of periodicals, the\r\neasiest and the commonest method by which a struggling man of letters\r\ncould make himself known; and literary heresy of any kind was an almost\r\ncertain cause of exclusion from the body when once the dictatorship of\r\nFontenelle (a benevolent autocrat who, being something of a heretic\r\nhimself, tolerated freethinking in others) had ceased. Moreover, except\r\nin rare cases, chiefly limited to persons of rank who were elected for\r\nreasons quite other than literary, it was not usual for an author to\r\ngain admission to the Academy until he was well stricken in years, and\r\nuntil, as a natural consequence, his tastes were for the most part\r\nformed, and he was impatient of innovation.\r\n\r\nAt first the influence of the Academy was beyond question salutary in\r\nthe main, if not wholly. Balzac, whose importance in the history of\r\nprose style has been pointed out, was one of its earliest members. It\r\nwas under its wing that Vaugelas undertook the much-needed enquiry into\r\nFrench grammar and its principles as applied to literature. The majority\r\nof the early members were connected with the refining and reforming\r\ncoteries of the Rambouillet and other salons. It was somewhat slow in\r\nelecting Boileau, though it is to be feared that this arose from no\r\nhigher motive than the fact that he had satirised most of its members.\r\nBut Boileau was the natural guiding spirit of an Academy, and it fell\r\nmore and more under his influence--not so much his personal influence as\r\nthat of his principles and critical estimates. In short, during the\r\nseventeenth century it played the very useful part of model and measure\r\nin the midst of a time when the chief danger was the neglect of measures\r\nand of models, and it played it very fairly. But by the time that the\r\neighteenth century began, it was by no means of a restraining and\r\nguiding influence that France had most need. The exuberance of creative\r\ngenius between 1630 and 1690 had supplied literature with actual models\r\nfar more valuable than any scheme of cut-and-dried rules, and it was in\r\nneed rather of a stimulant to spur it on to further development. Instead\r\nof serving as this, the Academy served (owing, it must be confessed, in\r\ngreat part to the literary conservatism of Voltaire and the\r\n_philosophes_ generally) as a check and drag upon the spontaneous\r\ninstincts all through the century, and in all the departments of Belles\r\nLettres. It contributed more than anything else to the mischievous\r\ncrystallisation of literary ideas, which during this time offers so\r\nstrange a contrast to the singular state of solution in which were all\r\nideas relating to religion, politics, and morals. The consequence of the\r\npropounding of a set of consecrated models, of the constant competition\r\nin imitation of those models, and of the reward of diligent and\r\nsuccessful imitation by admission into the body, which in its turn\r\nnursed and guided a new generation of imitators, was the reduction of\r\nlarge and important departments of literature to a condition of\r\ncut-and-driedness which has no parallel in history. The drama in\r\nparticular, which was artificial and limited at its best, was reduced\r\nto something like the state of a game in which every possible move or\r\nstroke is known and registered, and in which the sole novelty consists\r\nin contriving some permutation of these moves or strokes which shall be,\r\nif possible, not absolutely identical with any former combination. So in\r\na lesser degree, it was in poetry, in history, in prose tales, in verse\r\ntales. If a man had a loose imagination, he tried to imitate La Fontaine\r\nas well as he could in manner, and outbid him in matter; if he thought\r\nhimself an epigrammatist, he copied J. B. Rousseau; if he was disposed\r\nto edification, the same poet supplied him with models; if the gods had\r\nmade him descriptive, he executed variations in the style of Delille, or\r\nSaint Lambert, who had themselves copied others; if he wrote in any\r\nother style, he had an eye to the work of Voltaire. Neologism in\r\nvocabulary was carefully eschewed, and a natural consequence of this was\r\nthe resort (in the struggle not to repeat merely) to elaborate and\r\ningenious periphrases, such as those which have been quoted in the\r\nchapter on eighteenth-century poetry. In short, literature had got into\r\na sort of treadmill in which all the effort expended was expended merely\r\nin the repeated production of certain prescribed motions.\r\n\r\nIt was partly a natural result of this, and partly an effect of other\r\nand accidental causes, that the actual composition of the Academy was in\r\nthe first quarter of the nineteenth century by no means such as to\r\ninspire much respect. But it was all the less likely to initiate or to\r\nhead any movement of reform. The consequence was, that when the reform\r\ncame, it came from the outside, not from the inside, that it was\r\nviolently opposed, and that, though it prevailed, and its leaders\r\nthemselves quickly forced their way into the sacred precincts, it was as\r\nvictorious rebels, not as welcomed allies. The further consequence of\r\nthis, and of the changes of which account will be given briefly in the\r\nfollowing book, was the alteration to a great extent of the status of\r\nthe Academy. It still (though with the old reproach of illustrious\r\noutsiders) includes most of the leading men of letters of France, and\r\nits membership is still, theoretically, the greatest honour that a\r\nFrench man of letters can receive. But its position is far more\r\nornamental than it was. It hardly pretends to be in any sense\r\nlegislative: it is an honorary assembly, not a working parliament. The\r\nchief circumstance that keeps it before the public is the curious and\r\ntime-honoured custom which ordains that the academician appointed to\r\nreceive each new member shall, in the most polished and amiable manner,\r\ngive the most ironical description he can of the novice's achievements\r\nand claims to recognition.\r\n\r\nThe exact change in literature which has partly caused, and has partly\r\ncoincided with this change in the relation of the Academy to letters,\r\nwill shortly be displayed, though in somewhat less detail than those\r\nchanges which are at a sufficient distance to be estimated by the aid of\r\nwhat has been well called 'the firm perspective of the past.' For\r\ncut-and-dried rules of criticism, carefully selected and limited models,\r\nnarrow range of subject, scanty vocabulary and its corollary\r\nperiphrasis, stock metaphor and ornament, stiff or fluidly insignificant\r\nmetre and rhythm, there have been substituted the exact opposites. The\r\ngain in poetry is immense, and if it seems to be somewhat exhausted now,\r\nit is fair to remember that fifty years is a long flowering time for any\r\nspecial poetic plant, not often equalled in history, and still less\r\noften exceeded. The gain in prose has been more dubious. Great prose\r\nwriters will have to be noticed, but it may perhaps be doubted whether\r\nthe average value of French prose as prose has not declined. There would\r\nbe nothing surprising in this, if it be the case; on the contrary, it\r\nwould be a mere repetition of the experience of the sixteenth century.\r\nThe language and literature have been flooded with new words, new forms\r\nof speech, new ideas, new models. It takes a very long time before the\r\nmixture thus produced can settle down (at least in the vessel of the\r\naverage prose writer) to clearness and brilliancy. It is otherwise in\r\npoetry; in the first place because there is no such thing as an average\r\npoet, and in the second, because the peculiar conditions of poetry\r\nexercise of themselves a refining influence, which is not present in\r\nprose. At present it may be said, and not without truth, that, putting\r\nthe work of the extraordinary writers aside, ordinary French prose has\r\nlost some of its former graces--its lucidity, its proportion, its easy\r\nmarch. From being the most childishly prudish of all writers about\r\nneologisms and the _mot propre_, the French prose writer has become the\r\nmost clumsily promiscuous in his vocabulary. He is always using 'square'\r\ninstead of 'place,' 'le macadam' instead of 'le pave,' 'un caoutchouc'\r\nwhen he means a waterproof overcoat. Much of this, no doubt, is due to\r\nthe singular inability which the language seems to experience in forming\r\ngenuine vernacular compounds; an inability from which a few more persons\r\nlike the much ridiculed Du Bartas might have rescued it. But, however\r\nthis may be, it must be admitted that, great as have been the benefits\r\nof the Romantic movement, it has left the ordinary French prose style of\r\nnovel and newspaper in a condition of indigestion and disarray.\r\n\r\nAs for the movement itself, the most brilliant season of romantic\r\nproductiveness seems to have terminated, after being long represented\r\nonly by its greatest, earliest, and at the same time latest name. The\r\ncomparative disorganisation is all the more noticeable. It is in this\r\ndisorganisation that our history perforce leaves the magnificent\r\nliterature which we have traced from its source. Unsafe as all prophecy\r\nis, there are few things less safe to prophesy about than the progress\r\nof literary development. But it is not historically unreasonable to\r\nexpect, after the splendid harvest of the last half century, what is\r\ncalled a dead season, of longer or shorter duration. There is nothing\r\nreally discouraging in such seasons either in nature or in art. In each\r\ncase there is the garnered wealth of the past to fall back upon, and in\r\neach there is confidence that the seeming stagnation and death are in\r\ntruth only the necessary pause and period of gestation which precede and\r\nbring about the life of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\nTHE NINETEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romantic Movement.]\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapter will at once have indicated the defects under\r\nwhich the later classical literature of France laboured, and the\r\nremedies which were necessary for them. Those remedies began to be\r\napplied early in the reign of Charles X., and the literary revolution\r\nwhich accompanied them is called the Romantic movement. Strictly\r\nspeaking, this movement did not affect, or rather was not supposed to\r\naffect, any branch of letters except the Belles Lettres; really its\r\ninfluence was far wider, and has affected every branch of literary\r\ncomposition. Nor is it yet exhausted, although more than two generations\r\nhave passed since the current was started. As is usual in the later\r\nstages of such things, this influence is in part disguised under the\r\nform of apparent reactions, developments, modifications, and other\r\neddies or backwaters of the great wave. But as the Romantic movement was\r\nabove all things a movement of literary emancipation, it can never be\r\nsaid to be superseded until fresh chains are imposed on literature. Of\r\nthis there is as yet no sign, except in the puerile and disgusting\r\nschool of naturalism, a mere scum-flake--to keep up the metaphor--on the\r\nsurface of the waters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Writers of the later Transition.]\r\n\r\nThe literature of the Revolution, the Empire, and the early Restoration,\r\nwhich has been in part already surveyed, displayed the last effete\r\nproducts of the old classical tradition side by side with the vigorous\r\nbut nondescript and tentative efforts at reform of Chateaubriand, Madame\r\nde Stael, Courier, and others. So the first products of the new movement\r\nfound themselves side by side with what may be called a second\r\ngeneration of the transition. The names which chiefly illustrate this\r\nsecond generation must be dealt with before the Romantics proper are\r\narrived at. The chief of them are Beranger, Lamartine, Lamennais,\r\nCousin, Stendhal, Nodier, and the dramatists Alexandre Soumet and\r\nCasimir Delavigne. Most of these, while irresistibly impelled half way\r\ntowards the movement, stood aloof from it in feeling and taste; others,\r\nsuch as Stendhal, exercised upon it an influence not much felt at first,\r\nbut deep and lasting; one, Nodier, threw in his lot with it frankly and\r\ndecidedly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beranger.]\r\n\r\nPierre Jean de Beranger is one of the most original and not the least\r\npleasant figures in the long list of French poets. His life, though\r\nlong, was comparatively uneventful. Despite the particle of nobility, he\r\nbelonged to the middle class, and rather to the lower than to the upper\r\nportion of it; for, if his father was a man of business, his grandfather\r\nwas a tailor. He himself lived in his youth with an aunt at Peronne, was\r\nthen apprenticed to a printer, and was so ill off that, in 1804, he was\r\nsaved from absolute poverty only by the patronage of Lucien Bonaparte,\r\nto whom he had sent some of his verses, and who procured him a small\r\ngovernment clerkship. He held this for some years. After the\r\nRestoration, Beranger, whose political creed was an odd compound of\r\nBonapartism and Republicanism, got into trouble with the government for\r\nhis political songs. He was repeatedly fined and imprisoned, but each\r\nsentence made him more popular. After the Revolution of July, however,\r\nhe refused to accept any favours from the Orleanist dynasty, and lived\r\nquietly, publishing nothing after 1833. In 1848 he was elected to the\r\nAssembly, but immediately resigned his seat. He behaved to the Second\r\nEmpire as he had behaved to the July monarchy, refusing all honours and\r\nappointments. He died in 1857. Beranger's poetical works consist\r\nentirely of _Chansons_, political, amatory, bacchanalian, satirical,\r\nphilosophical after a fashion, and of almost every other complexion that\r\nthe song can possibly take. Their form is exactly that of the\r\neighteenth-century _Chanson_, the frivolity and licence of language\r\nbeing considerably curtailed, and the range of subjects proportionately\r\nextended. The popularity of Beranger with ordinary readers, both in and\r\nout of his own country, has always been immense; but a somewhat singular\r\nreluctance to admit his merits has been shown by successive generations\r\nof purely literary critics. In France his early contemporaries found\r\nfault with him on the one hand for being a mere _chansonnier,_ and on\r\nthe other, for dealing with the _chanson_ in a graver tone than that of\r\nhis masters, Panard, Colle, Gouffe, and his immediate predecessor and in\r\npart contemporary, Desaugiers. The sentimental school of the Restoration\r\nthought him vulgar and unromantic. The Romantics proper disdained his\r\npedestrian and conventional style, his classic vocabulary. The\r\nneo-Catholics disliked his Voltairianism. The Royalists and the\r\nRepublicans detested, and detest equally, though from the most opposite\r\nsides, his devotion to the Napoleonic legend. Yet Beranger deserves his\r\npopularity, and does not deserve the grudging appreciation of critics.\r\nHis one serious fault is the retention of the conventional mannerism of\r\nthe eighteenth century in point of poetic diction, and he might argue\r\nthat time had almost irrevocably associated this with the _chanson_\r\nstyle. His versification, careless as it looks, is really studied with a\r\ngreat deal of care and success. As to his matter, only prejudice against\r\nhis political, religious, and ethical attitude, can obscure the lively\r\nwit of his best work; its remarkable pathos; its sound common sense; its\r\nhearty, if somewhat narrow and mistaken, patriotism; its freedom from\r\nself-seeking and personal vanity, spite, or greed; its thorough humanity\r\nand wholesome natural feeling. Nor can it be fairly said that his range\r\nis narrow. _Le Grenier_, _Le Roi d'Yvetot_, _Roger Bontemps_, _Les\r\nSouvenirs du Peuple_, _Les Fous_, _Les Gueux_, cover a considerable\r\nvariety of tones and subjects, all of which are happily treated.\r\nBeranger indeed was not in the least a literary poet. But there is room\r\nin literature for other than merely literary poets, and among these\r\nBeranger will always hold a very high place. The common comparison of\r\nhim to Burns is in this erroneous, that the element of passion, which is\r\nthe most prominent in Burns, is almost absent from Beranger, and that\r\nthe unliterary character which was an accident with Burns was with\r\nBeranger essential. The point of contact is, that both were among the\r\nmost admirable of song writers, and that both hit infallibly the tastes\r\nof the masses among their countrymen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lamartine.]\r\n\r\nAlphonse Prat de Lamartine was in almost every conceivable respect the\r\nexact opposite to Beranger. He was born at Macon, on the 21st of\r\nOctober, 1791, of a good family of Franche Comte, which, though never\r\nvery rich, had long devoted itself to arms and agriculture only. His\r\nfather was a strong royalist, was imprisoned during the Terror, and\r\nescaped narrowly. Lamartine was educated principally by the Peres de la\r\nFoi, and, after leaving school, spent some time first at home and then\r\nin Italy. The Restoration gave him entrance to the royal bodyguard; but\r\nhe soon exchanged soldiering for diplomacy, and was appointed attache in\r\nItaly. He had already (1820) published the _Meditations_, his first\r\nvolume of verse, which had a great success. Lamartine married an English\r\nlady in 1822, and spent some years in the French legations at Naples and\r\nFlorence. He was elected to the Academy in 1829. After the revolution of\r\nJuly he set out for the East, but, being elected by a constituency to\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies, returned. He acquired much fame as an orator,\r\ncontributed not a little to the overthrow of Louis Philippe, and in 1848\r\nenjoyed for a brief space something not unlike a dictatorship. Power,\r\nhowever, soon slipped through his hands, and he retired into private\r\nlife. His later days were troubled by money difficulties, though he\r\nwrote incessantly. In 1867 he received a large grant from the government\r\nof Napoleon III., and died not long afterwards--in 1869. The chief works\r\nof Lamartine are, in verse, the already mentioned _Meditations_ (of\r\nwhich a new series appeared in 1823), the _Harmonies_, 1829, the\r\n_Recueillements_, _Le Dernier Chant du Pelerinage d'Harold_, _Jocelyn_,\r\n_La Chute d'un Ange_, the two last being fragments of a huge epic poem\r\non the ages of the world; in prose, _Souvenirs d'Orient_, _Histoire des\r\nGirondins_, _Les Confidences_, _Raphael_, _Graziella_, besides an\r\nimmense amount of work for the booksellers, in history, biography,\r\ncriticism, and fiction, produced in his later days. Lamartine's\r\ncharacteristics, both in prose and verse, are well marked. He is before\r\nall things a sentimentalist and a landscape-painter. He may indeed be\r\nsaid to have wrought into verse what Rousseau, Bernardin de\r\nSaint-Pierre, and Chateaubriand had already expressed in prose,\r\nsupplying only an additional, and perhaps original, note of meditative\r\ntenderness. Lamartine's verse is exquisitely harmonious, and frequently\r\npicturesque; but it is deficient in vigour and brilliancy, and marred by\r\nthe perpetual current of sentimental complaining. Beyond this he never\r\ncould get; his only important attempt in a different and larger style,\r\nthe _Chute d'un Ange_, being, though not without merits, on the whole a\r\nfailure. In harmony of verse and delicate tenderness of feeling his\r\npoetry was an enormous advance on the eighteenth century, and its power\r\nover its first readers is easily understood. But Lamartine made little,\r\nif any, organic change in the mechanism of French poetry, so far as its\r\nversification is concerned, while his want of range in subject equally\r\ndisabled him from effecting a revolution. His best poems, such as _Le\r\nLac_, _Paysage dans le Golfe de Genes_, _Le Premier Regret_, are however\r\namong the happiest expressions of a dainty but rather conventional\r\nmelancholy, irreproachable from the point of view of morals and\r\nreligion, thoroughly well bred, and creditably aware of the beauties of\r\nnature, which it describes and reproduces with a great deal of skill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lamennais.]\r\n\r\nThe next name on the list belongs to a far stronger, if a less\r\naccomplished, spirit than Lamartine. Felicite Robert de Lamennais was\r\nborn in 1782, at St. Malo. In the confusion of the last decade of the\r\neighteenth century, when, as a contemporary bears witness, even persons\r\nholding important state offices had often received no regular education\r\nwhatever, Lamennais was for the most part his own teacher. He betook\r\nhimself, however, to literature, and in 1807 was appointed to a\r\nmastership in the St. Malo Grammar School. Shortly afterwards he\r\npublished a treatise on 'The Church during the Eighteenth Century,' and\r\ntaking orders before long followed it up by others. These placed him in\r\nthe forefront of the Catholic reaction, of which Chateaubriand from the\r\npicturesque, and Joseph de Maistre from the philosophical side, were the\r\nleaders. He took priest's orders in 1816, and in 1817 published his\r\n_Essai sur l'Indifference en Matiere de Religion_. This is a sweeping\r\ndefence of the absolute authority of the Church, but the 'rift within\r\nthe lute' already appears. Lamennais bases this authority, according to\r\na tradition of that very eighteenth century which he most ardently\r\nopposes, on universal consent. Although therefore the deductive portion\r\nof his argument is in thorough accordance with Roman doctrine, the\r\ninductive portion can hardly be said to be so, and it prepared the way\r\nfor his subsequent change of front. For a time Lamennais contented\r\nhimself with the hope of establishing a sect of liberal royalist\r\nCatholics. A rapid succession of journals, most of which were\r\nsuppressed, led to the _Avenir_, in which Montalembert, Lacordaire, and\r\nothers took part, and which, like some English periodicals of a later\r\nperiod, aimed directly at the union of orthodox religious principles of\r\nthe Roman complexion with political liberalism, and a certain freedom of\r\nthought in other directions. The _Avenir_ was definitely censured by\r\nGregory XVI. in 1832, and Lamennais rapidly fell away from his previous\r\northodoxy. He had established himself in the country with a following of\r\nyouthful disciples. Of these the best-known now is Maurice de Guerin, a\r\nfeeble poet who died young, but who, with his abler sister Eugenie,\r\ninterested Sainte-Beuve, Mr. Matthew Arnold, and others. _Les Paroles\r\nd'un Croyant_, which appeared in 1834, united speculative Republicanism\r\nof the most advanced kind with a direct defiance of Rome in matter of\r\nreligion, and this was followed by a long series of works in the same\r\nspirit. Lamennais' ardent and ill-balanced temperament, the chief note\r\nof which was the most excessive personal vanity, no sooner threw off the\r\nyoke of orthodoxy than it ran to the opposite extreme, and the Catholic\r\nroyalist of the first empire became an atheistic, or at most theistic,\r\ndemocrat. Lamennais died in 1854. He had a great influence both on men\r\nand on books in France, and his literary work is extremely remarkable.\r\nIt bears the marks of his insufficient education and of his excitable\r\ntemperament. In the _Paroles d'un Croyant_ the style is altogether\r\napocalyptic in its mystic and broken declamation, full of colour,\r\nenergy, and vague impressiveness, but entirely wanting in order,\r\nlucidity, and arrangement. The earlier works show something of this,\r\nthough necessarily not so much. Lamennais' literary, as distinguished\r\nfrom his political and social, importance consists in the fact that he\r\nwas practically the first to introduce this style into French. He has\r\nsince had notable disciples, among whom Michelet and even Victor Hugo\r\nmay be ranked.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victor Cousin.]\r\n\r\nThe contrast of the return from Lamennais to Cousin is almost as great\r\nas that of the change from Lamartine to Lamennais. The careers of the\r\npoet and the philosopher have indeed something in common, for Cousin's\r\ndelicate, exquisite, and somewhat feminine prose style is a nearer\r\nanalogue to the poetry of Lamartine even than the latter's own prose,\r\nand the sudden decline of Cousin's reputation in philosophy almost\r\nmatches that of Lamartine's reputation as a poet. Victor Cousin was born\r\nin 1792, at Paris, and was one of the most brilliant pupils of the Lycee\r\nCharlemagne. He passed thence to the Ecole Normale, and, in the year of\r\nthe Restoration, became Assistant Professor to Royer Collard at the\r\nSorbonne. He adopted vigorously the doctrines of that philosopher, which\r\npractically amounted to a translation of the Scottish school of Reid and\r\nStewart, but he soon combined with them much that he borrowed from Kant\r\nand his successors in Germany. This latter country he visited twice; on\r\nthe second occasion with the unpleasant result of an arrest. He soon\r\nreturned to France, however, and became distinguished as a supporter of\r\nthe liberal party. The years immediately before and after the July\r\nRevolution were Cousin's most successful time. His lectures were\r\ncrowded, his eclecticism was novel and popular, and when after July\r\nitself he became officially powerful, he distinguished himself by\r\npatronising young men of genius. During the reign of Louis Philippe he\r\nwas one of the most influential of men of letters, though curiously\r\nenough, he combined with his political liberalism a certain tendency to\r\nreaction in matters of pure literature. After 1848 he retired from\r\npublic life, and, though he survived for nearly twenty years, produced\r\nlittle more in philosophy. His brilliant but patchy eclecticism had had\r\nits day, and he saw it; but he earned new and perhaps more lasting\r\nlaurels by betaking himself to the study of French literary history, and\r\nproducing some charming essays on the ladies of the Fronde. Cousin's\r\nhistory is interesting as an instance of the accidental prosperity which\r\nin the first half of this century the mixture of politics and\r\nliterature brought to men of letters. But his own literary merits are\r\nvery considerable. Without the freedom and originality of the great\r\nwriters who were for the most part his juniors by ten or twenty years,\r\nhe possessed a style studied from the best models of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, which, despite a certain artificiality, has great beauty.\r\nBesides editions of philosophical classics, the chief works of his\r\nearlier period are _Fragments Philosophiques_, 1827, _Cours de\r\nl'Histoire de la Philosophie_, 1827; of his later, _Du Vrai_, _Du Beau\r\net Du Bien_, and his studies on the women of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beyle.]\r\n\r\nThe author now to be noticed has found little place hitherto in\r\nhistories of literature, and estimates of his positive value are even\r\nyet much divided. Henri Beyle, who wrote under the name of De Stendhal,\r\nwas born at Grenoble, in January, 1783. His family belonged to the\r\nmiddle class, though, unfortunately, Beyle allowed himself during the\r\nEmpire to be called M. _de_ Beyle, and incurred not a little ridicule in\r\nconsequence. His literary _alias_ was also, it may be noticed, arranged\r\nso as to claim nobility. He was a clever boy, but manifested no special\r\npredilection for any profession. At last he entered the army, and served\r\nin it (chiefly in the non-combatant branches) on some important\r\noccasions, including the campaigns of the St. Bernard, of Jena, and of\r\nMoscow. He also held some employments in the civil service of the\r\nEmpire. At the Restoration he went to Italy, which was always his\r\nfavourite place of residence; but when in 1821 political troubles began\r\nto arise, he was 'politely' expelled by the Austrian police. After this\r\nhe lived chiefly in Paris, making part of his living by the unexpected\r\nfunction of contributing to the London _New Monthly Magazine_. He knew\r\nEnglish well, admired our literature, and visited London more than once.\r\nBeing, as far as he was a politician at all, a Bonapartist, he was not\r\nspecially interested in the Revolution of 1830; but it was profitable to\r\nhim, for through some of his friends he was appointed French consul,\r\nfirst at Trieste, and then (the Austrians objecting) at Civita Vecchia.\r\nHe lived, however, chiefly at Rome, and travelled a good deal. Latterly\r\nhis health was weak, and he died at Paris, in 1842, of apoplexy. He was\r\nburied at Montmartre; but, with his usual eccentricity, his epitaph was\r\nby his direction written in Italian, and he was described as a Milanese.\r\nBeyle's character, personal and literary, was very peculiar. In\r\ntemperament, religious views, and social ideas he was a belated\r\n_philosophe_ of the Diderot school. But in literature he had improved\r\neven on Diderot, and very nearly anticipated the full results of the\r\nRomantic movement, while in politics, as has been said, he was an\r\nimperialist. His works are pretty voluminous. They consist of novels\r\n(_La Chartreuse de Parme_, _Armance_, _Le Rouge et le Noir_, _Memoires\r\nd'un Touriste_, etc.); of criticism (_Histoire de la Peinture en\r\nItalie_, _Racine et Shakespeare_, _Melanges_); of biography (Lives of\r\nNapoleon, Haydn, Mozart, Metastasio, etc.); of topographical writing of\r\na miscellaneous kind (_Promenades dans Rome, Naples et Florence_, etc.);\r\nand lastly, of a singular book entitled _De l'Amour_, which unites\r\nextraordinary acuteness and originality of thought with cynicism of\r\nexpression and paradox of theory. In this book, and in his novels, Beyle\r\nmade himself the ancestor of what has been called successively realism\r\nand naturalism in France. Perhaps, however, his most remarkable work was\r\nMerimee, of whose family he was a friend, and who, far excelling him in\r\nmerit of style if not in freshness of thought, learnt beyond all doubt\r\nfrom him his peculiar and half-affected cynicism of tone, his curious\r\npredilection for the apparently opposed literatures of England and\r\nSouthern Europe, and not improbably also his imperialism. Beyle is a\r\ndifficult author to judge briefly, the contradictions, affectations, and\r\noddities in him demanding minute examination. Of his power, intrinsic\r\nand exerted on others, there is no doubt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nodier.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Delavigne.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soumet.]\r\n\r\nThe three remaining writers require shorter notice. Charles Nodier, who\r\nwas born at Besancon in 1780, and died at Paris in 1844, is one of the\r\nmost remarkable failures of a great genius in French literary history.\r\nHe did almost everything--lexicography, text-editing, criticism, poetry,\r\nromance--and he did everything well, but perhaps nothing supremely well.\r\nIf an exception be made to this verdict, it must be in favour of his\r\nshort tales, some of which are exquisite, and all but, if not quite,\r\nmasterpieces. As librarian of the Mazarin Library, Nodier was a kind of\r\ncentre of the early Romantic circle, and, though he was more than\r\ntwenty years older than most of its members, he identified himself\r\nthoroughly with their aims and objects. His consummate knowledge of the\r\nhistory and vocabulary of the French tongue probably had no mean\r\ninfluence on that conservative and restorative character which was one\r\nof the best sides of the movement. Casimir Delavigne was born at Havre\r\nin 1793. He first distinguished himself by his _Messeniennes_, a series\r\nof satires or patriotic jeremiads on the supposed degradation of France\r\nunder the Restoration. Then he took to the stage, and produced\r\nsuccessively _Les Vepres Siciliennes_, _Marino Faliero_, _Louis XI_.\r\n(well known in England from the affection which several English tragic\r\nactors have shown for the title part), _Les Enfants d'Edouard_, etc. He\r\nalso wrote other non-dramatic poems, most of them of a political\r\ncharacter. Casimir Delavigne is a writer of little intrinsic worth. He\r\nheld aloof from the Romantic movement, less from dislike to its\r\nextravagances and its cliquism, than from genuine weakness and inability\r\nto appreciate the defects of the classic tradition. He is in fact the\r\ndirect successor of Ducis and Marie Joseph Chenier, having forgotten\r\nsomething, but learned little. The defects of his poems are parallel to\r\nthose of his plays. His patriotism is conventional, his verse\r\nconventional, his expression conventional, though the convention is in\r\nall three cases slightly concealed by the skilful adoption of a certain\r\noutward colouring of energy and picturesqueness. He was not unpopular in\r\nhis day, being patronised to a certain extent by the extreme classical\r\nparty, and recommended to the public by his liberal political\r\nprinciples. But he is almost entirely obsolete already, and is never\r\nlikely to recover more than the reputation due to fair literary\r\nworkmanship in an inferior style. Alexandre Soumet was another dramatist\r\nof the same kind, but perhaps of a less artificial stamp. He adhered to\r\nthe old model of drama, or to something like it, more, apparently,\r\nbecause it satisfied his requirements, than from abstract predilection\r\nfor it, or from dislike to the new models. His _Norma_ has the merit of\r\nhaving at least suggested the libretto of one of the most popular of\r\nmodern operas, and his _Une Fete sous Neron_ is not devoid of merit.\r\nSoumet was in the early days of the movement a kind of outsider in it,\r\nand it cannot be said that at any time he became an enemy, or that his\r\nwork is conspicuous for any fatal defects according to the new method of\r\ncriticism. A deficiency of initiative, rather than, as in Delavigne's\r\ncase, a preference of inferior models, seems to have been the reason why\r\nhe did not advance further.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romantic Propaganda in Periodicals.]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, reserved for a younger generation actually to cross the\r\nRubicon, and to achieve the reform which was needed. The assistance\r\nwhich the vast spread of periodical literature lent to such an attempt\r\nhas been already noted, and it was in four periodical publications that\r\nthe first definite note of the literary revolution was sounded. In these\r\nthe movement was carried on for many years before the famous\r\nrepresentation of _Hernani_, which announced the triumph of the\r\ninnovators. These four publications were: first, _Le Conservateur\r\nLitteraire_ (a journal published as early as 1819, before the _Odes_ of\r\nVictor Hugo, who was one of its main-stays, or even the _Meditations_ of\r\nLamartine had appeared); secondly, the _Annales Romantiques_, which\r\nbegan in 1823, with perhaps the most brilliant list of contributors that\r\nany periodical--with the possible exception of the nearly contemporary\r\n_London Magazine_--ever had; a list including Chateaubriand, Lamennais,\r\nLamartine, Joseph de Maistre (posthumously), Alfred de Vigny, Henri de\r\nLatouche, Hugo, Nodier, Beranger, Casimir Delavigne, Madame\r\nDesbordes-Valmore, and Delphine Gay, afterwards Madame de Girardin.\r\nAlthough not formally, this was practically a kind of annual of the\r\n_Muse Francaise_, which had pretty nearly the same contributors, and\r\nconducted the warfare in more definitely polemical manner by criticism\r\nand precept, as well as by example. Lastly, there was the important\r\nnewspaper--a real newspaper this--called _Le Globe_, which appeared in\r\n1822. The other Romantic organs had been either colourless as regards\r\npolitics, or else more or less definitely conservative and monarchical,\r\nthe middle age influence being still strong. The _Globe_ was avowedly\r\nliberal in politics. Men of the greatest eminence in various ways,\r\nJouffroy, Damiron, Pierre Leroux, and Charles de Remusat, wrote in it;\r\nbut its literary importance in history is due to the fact that here\r\nSainte-Beuve, the critic of the movement, began, and for a long time\r\ncarried out the vast series of critical studies of French and other\r\nliterature which, partly by destruction and partly by construction, made\r\nthe older literary theory for ever obsolete. The various names in poetry\r\nand prose of this romantic movement must now be reviewed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victor Hugo.]\r\n\r\nVictor Marie Hugo was born at Besancon on the 28th of February, 1802.\r\nHis father was an officer of distinction in Napoleon's army, his mother\r\nwas of Vendean blood and of royalist principles, which last her son for\r\na long time shared. His literary activity began extremely early. He was,\r\nas has been seen, a contributor to the _Conservateur Litteraire_ at the\r\nage of seventeen, and, with much work which he did not choose to\r\npreserve, some which still worthily finds a place in his published\r\ncollections appeared there. Indeed, with his two brothers, Abel and\r\nEugene, he took a principal share in the management of the periodical.\r\nHis _Odes et Poesies Diverses_ appeared in 1822, when he was twenty, and\r\nwere followed two years afterwards by a fresh collection. In these\r\npoems, though great strength and beauty of diction are apparent, nothing\r\nthat can be called distinct innovation appears. It is otherwise with the\r\n_Odes et Ballades_ of 1826, and the _Orientales_ of 1829. Here the\r\nRomantic challenge is definitely thrown down. The subjects are taken by\r\npreference from times and countries which the classical tradition had\r\nregarded as barbarous. The metres and rhythm are studiously broken,\r\nvaried, and irregular; the language has the utmost possible glow of\r\ncolour as opposed to the cold correctness of classical poetry, the\r\ncompletest disdain of conventional periphrasis, the boldest reliance on\r\nexotic terms and daring neologisms. Two romances in prose, more\r\nfantastic in subject and audacious in treatment than the wildest of the\r\n_Orientales_, had preceded the latter. The first, _Han d'Islande_, was\r\npublished anonymously in 1823. It handled with much extravagance, but\r\nwith extraordinary force and picturesqueness, the adventures of a bandit\r\nin Norway. The second, _Bug Jargal_, an earlier form of which had\r\nalready appeared in the _Conservateur_, was published in 1826. But the\r\nrebels, of whom Victor Hugo was by this time the acknowledged chief,\r\nknew that the theatre was at once the stronghold of their enemies, and\r\nthe most important point of vantage for themselves. Victor Hugo's\r\ntheatrical, or at least dramatic, _debut_ was not altogether happy.\r\n_Cromwell_, which was published in 1828, was not acted, and indeed, from\r\nits great length and other peculiarities, could hardly have been acted.\r\nIt is rather a romance thrown into dramatic form than a play. In its\r\npublished shape, however, it was introduced by an elaborate preface,\r\ncontaining a full exposition of the new views which served as a kind of\r\nmanifesto. Some minor works about this time need not be noticed. The\r\nfinal strokes in verse and prose were struck, the one shortly before the\r\nrevolution of July, the other shortly after it, by the drama of\r\n_Hernani, ou l'Honneur Castillan_, and the prose romance of _Notre Dame\r\nde Paris_. The former, after great difficulties with the actors and with\r\noutside influences--it is said that certain academicians of the old\r\nschool actually applied to Charles X. to forbid the representation--was\r\nacted at the Theatre Francais on the 25th of February, 1830. The latter\r\nwas published in 1831. The reading of these two celebrated works,\r\ndespite nearly sixty years of subsequent and constant production with\r\nunflagging powers on the part of their author, would suffice to give any\r\none a fair, though not a complete, idea of Victor Hugo, and of the\r\ncharacteristics of the literary movement of which he has been the head.\r\nThe main subject of _Hernani_ is the point of honour which compels a\r\nnoble Spaniard to kill himself, in obedience to the blast of a horn\r\nsounded by his mortal enemy, at the very moment of his marriage with his\r\nbeloved. _Notre Dame de Paris_ is a picture by turns brilliant and\r\nsombre of the manners of the mediaeval capital. In both the author's\r\ngreat failing, a deficient sense of humour and of proportion, which\r\noccasionally makes him overstep the line between the sublime and the\r\nridiculous, is sometimes perceivable. In both, too, there is a certain\r\nlack of technical neatness and completeness in construction. But the\r\nextraordinary command of the tragic passions of pity, admiration, and\r\nterror, the wonderful faculty of painting in words, the magnificence of\r\nlanguage, the power of indefinite poetical suggestion, the sweep and\r\nrush of style which transports the reader, almost against his will and\r\njudgment, are fully manifest in them. As a mere innovation, _Hernani_\r\nis the most striking of the two. Almost every rule of the old French\r\nstage is deliberately violated. Although the language is in parts ornate\r\nto a degree, the old periphrases are wholly excluded; and when simple\r\nthings have to be said they are said with the utmost simplicity. The\r\ncadence and arrangement of the classical Alexandrine are audaciously\r\nreconstructed. Not merely is the practice of _enjambement_ (or\r\noverlapping of lines and couplets, as distinct from the rigid separation\r\nof them) frequent and daring, but the whole balance and rhythm of the\r\nindividual line is altered. Ever since Racine the one aim of the\r\ndramatist had been to make the Alexandrine run as monotonously as\r\npossible. The aim of Victor Hugo was to make it run with the greatest\r\npossible variety. In short, the whole theory of the drama was altered.\r\nThe decade which followed the revolution of July was Victor Hugo's most\r\ntriumphant period. A series of dramas, _Marion de Lorme_, _Les Roi\r\ns'Amuse_, _Lucrece Borgia_, _Marie Tudor_, _Angelo_, _Les Burgraves_,\r\nsucceeded each other at short intervals, and were accompanied by four\r\nvolumes of immortal verse, _Les Feuilles d'Automne_, _Chants du\r\nCrepuscule_, _Les Voix Interieures_, _Les Rayons et les Ombres_. The\r\ndramas continued to show Victor Hugo's command of tragic passion, his\r\nwonderful faculty of verse, his fertility in moving situations, and in\r\nincidents of horror and grandeur; but they did not indicate an increased\r\nacquaintance with those minor arts of the playwright, which are\r\nnecessary to the success of acted dramas, and which many of Hugo's own\r\npupils possessed to perfection. Accordingly, towards the end of the\r\ndecade, some reaction took place against them, and their author ceased\r\nto write for the stage. His purely poetical productions showed, however,\r\nan increase at once of poetical and of critical power; and of the four\r\nvolumes mentioned, each one contains many pieces which have never been\r\nexcelled in French poetry, and which may be fairly compared with the\r\ngreatest poetical productions of the same kind in other literatures.\r\nMeanwhile, Victor Hugo's political ideas (which never, in any of their\r\nforms, brought him much luck, literary or other) had undergone a\r\nremarkable change. During the reign of Louis Philippe, he, who had\r\nrecently been an ardent legitimist, became, first, a constitutional\r\nroyalist (in which capacity he accepted from the king a peerage), then\r\nan extreme liberal, and at last, when the revolution of 1848 broke out,\r\na republican democrat. He was banished for his opposition to Louis\r\nNapoleon, and fled, first to Brussels, and then to the Channel Islands,\r\nlaunching against his enemy a prose lampoon, _Napoleon le Petit_, and\r\nthen a volume of verse, _Les Chatiments_, of marvellous vigour and\r\nbrilliancy. During the ten years before this his literary work had been\r\nfor the most part suspended, at least as far as publication is\r\nconcerned. But his exile gave a fresh spur to his genius. After four\r\nyears' residence, first in Jersey, then in Guernsey, he published _Les\r\nContemplations_ (2 vols.), a collection of lyrical pieces, not different\r\nin general form from the four volumes which had preceded them; and, in\r\n1859, _La Legende des Siecles_, a marvellous series of narrative or\r\npictorial poems representing scenes from different epochs of the history\r\nof the world. These three volumes together represent his poetical talent\r\nat its highest. He, at other times before and since, equalled but never\r\nsurpassed them. In _La Legende des Siecles_ the variety of the music,\r\nthe majesty of some of the pieces and the pathos of others, the rapid\r\nsuccession of brilliant dissolving views, and the complete mastery of\r\nlanguage and versification at which the poet arrived, combine to produce\r\nan effect not easily paralleled elsewhere. The _Contemplations_, as\r\ntheir name imports, are chiefly meditative. They are somewhat unequal,\r\nand the tone of speculative pondering on the mysteries of life which\r\ndistinguishes them sometimes drops into what is called sermonising, but\r\ntheir best pieces are admirable. During the whole of the Second Empire\r\nVictor Hugo continued to reside in Guernsey, publishing, in 1862, a long\r\nprose romance, _Les Miserables_, one of the most unequal of his books;\r\nthen another, the exquisite _Travailleurs de la Mer_, as well as a\r\nvolume of criticism on _William Shakespeare_, some passages in which\r\nrank among the best pieces of ornate prose in French; and, in 1869,\r\n_L'Homme qui Rit_, a historical romance of a somewhat extravagant\r\ncharacter, recalling his earliest attempts in this kind, but full of\r\npower. A small collection of lyric verse, mostly light and pastoral in\r\ncharacter, had appeared under the title of _Chansons des Rues et des\r\nBois_. The Revolution which followed the troubles of France, in 1870,\r\nrestored Victor Hugo to his country only to inflict a bitter, though\r\npassing, annoyance on him. He had somewhat mistaken the temper of the\r\nNational Assembly at Bordeaux to which he had been elected. He even\r\nfound himself laughed at, and he retired to Brussels in disgust. Here he\r\nwas identified by public opinion with the Communists, and subjected to\r\nsome manifestations of popular displeasure, which, unfortunately, his\r\nsensitive temperament and vivid imagination magnified unreasonably.\r\nReturning to France after the publication of nearly his weakest book,\r\n_L'Annee Terrible_, he lived quietly, but as a kind of popular and\r\nliterary idol, till his death in 1885. Of his abundant later (including\r\nnot a little posthumous) work _Quatre-Vingt-Treize_, another historical\r\nromance, and two books of poetry (a second series of the _Legende des\r\nSiecles_, 1877, and _Les Quatre Vents de l'Esprit_, 1881) at their best,\r\nequal anything he has ever done. The second _Legende_ is inferior to the\r\nfirst in variety of tone and in vivid pictorial presentment, but equals\r\nit in the declamatory vigour of its best passages. _Les Quatre Vents de\r\nl'Esprit_ is, perhaps, the most striking single book that Victor Hugo\r\nproduced, containing as it does lyric and narrative work of the very\r\nfinest quality, and a drama of an entirely original character, which,\r\nafter more than sixty years of publicity, showed a new side of the\r\nauthor's genius.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat minute account of Victor Hugo's work must be supplemented\r\nby some general criticism of his literary characteristics. As will\r\nprobably have been observed, from what has already been said, there were\r\nremarkable gaps in his ability. In purely intellectual characteristics,\r\nthe characteristics of the logician and the philosopher, he was weak. He\r\nwas also, as has been said, deficient in the sense of humorous contrast,\r\nand in the perception of strict literary proportion. Long years of\r\nsolitary pre-eminence, and of the frequently unreasonable worship of\r\nfools as well as of wise men, gave him, or encouraged in him, a tendency\r\nto regard the universe too much from the point of view of France in the\r\nfirst place, Paris in the second, and Victor Hugo in the third. His\r\nunequalled skill in the management of proper names tempted him to abuse\r\nthem as instruments of sonority in his verse. He is often inaccurate in\r\nfact, presenting in this respect a remarkable resemblance to his\r\ncounterpart and complement Voltaire. The one merit which swallowed up\r\nalmost all others in classical and pseudo-classical literature is\r\nwanting in him--the sense of measure. He is a childish politician, a\r\nvisionary social reformer. But, when all this has been said, there\r\nremains a sum total of purely literary merits which suffices to place\r\nhim on a level with the greatest in literature. The mere fact that he is\r\nequally remarkable for the exquisite grace of his smaller lyrics, and\r\nfor the rhetorical magnificence of his declamatory passages, argues some\r\npeculiar and masterly idiosyncrasy in him. No poet has a rarer and more\r\ndelicate touch of pathos, none a more masculine or a fuller tone of\r\nindignation. The great peculiarity of Victor Hugo is that his poetry\r\nalways transports. No one who cares for poetry at all, and who has\r\nmastered the preliminary necessity of acquaintance with the French\r\nlanguage and French prosody, can read any of his better works without\r\ngradually rising to a condition of enthusiasm in which the possible\r\ndefects of the matter are altogether lost sight of in the unsurpassed\r\nand dazzling excellence of the manner. This is the special test of\r\npoetry, and there is none other. The technical means by which Victor\r\nHugo produces these effects have been already hinted at. They consist in\r\na mastery of varied versification, in an extraordinary command of\r\npictorial language, dealing at once with physical and mental phenomena,\r\nand, above all, in a certain irresistible habit of never allowing the\r\niron to grow cold. Stroke follows stroke in the exciting and\r\ntransporting process in a manner not easily paralleled in other writers.\r\nOther poets are often best exhibited by very short extracts, by jewels\r\nfive words long. This is not so with Victor Hugo. He has such jewels,\r\nbut they are not his chief titles to admiration. The ardour and flow, as\r\nof molten metal, which characterise him are felt only in the mass, and\r\nmust be sought there. What has been said of his verse is true, with but\r\nslight modifications, of his prose, which is however on the whole\r\ninferior. His unequalled versification is a weapon which he could not\r\nexchange for the less pointed tool of prose without losing much of his\r\npower. His defects emerge as his merits subside. But taking him\r\naltogether, it may be asserted, without the least fear of\r\ncontradiction, that Victor Hugo deserves the title of the greatest poet\r\nhitherto, and of one of the greatest prose writers of France. Such a\r\nfaculty, thrown into almost any cause, must have gone far to make it\r\ntriumph. But in a cause of such merits, and so stoutly seconded by\r\nothers, as that of the destruction of the classical tradition which had\r\ncramped and starved French literature, there could be no doubt of\r\nsuccess when a champion such as Victor Hugo took up and carried through\r\nto the end the task of championship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sainte-Beuve.]\r\n\r\nIt is very seldom that the two different forces of criticism and\r\ncreation work together as they did in the case of the Romantic movement.\r\nEach had numerous representatives, but the point of importance is that\r\neach was represented by one of the greatest masters. Charles Augustin\r\nSainte-Beuve, the critic not merely of the Romantic movement, but of the\r\nnineteenth century, and in a manner the first scientific and universal\r\ncritic that the world has seen, was born at Boulogne on the 23rd of\r\nDecember, 1804. His father held an office of some importance; his mother\r\nwas of English blood. He was well educated, first at his native town,\r\nthen at Paris. He began by studying medicine, but very soon turned to\r\nliterature, and, as has been said, distinguished himself on the _Globe_.\r\nThe most important of his articles in this paper were devoted to the\r\nFrench literature of the sixteenth century, and these were published as\r\na volume, in 1828, with great success. Sainte-Beuve at once became the\r\ncritic _en titre_ of the movement, though he did not very long continue\r\nin formal connection with it. It was some time, however, before he\r\nresigned himself to purely critical work. _Les Poesies de Joseph\r\nDelorme_, _Les Consolations_, and _Volupte_ were successive attempts at\r\noriginal composition, which, despite the talent of their author, hardly\r\nmade much mark, or deserved to make it. He did not persevere further in\r\na career for which he was evidently unfitted, but betook himself to the\r\nlong series of separate critical studies, partly of foreign and\r\nclassical literature, but usually of French, which made his reputation.\r\nThe papers to which he chiefly contributed were the _Constitutionnel_\r\nand the _Moniteur_, and during the middle of this century his Monday\r\n_feuilletons_ of criticism were the chief recurring literary event of\r\nEurope. These studies were at intervals collected and published in sets\r\nunder the titles _Critiques et Portraits Litteraires_, _Portraits\r\nContemporains_, _Causeries du Lundi_, and _Nouveaux Lundis_, the last\r\nseries only finishing with his death in 1869. Besides this he had\r\nundertaken a single work of great magnitude in his _Histoire de Port\r\nRoyal_, on which he spent some twenty years. He was elected to the\r\nAcademy in 1845, and after the establishment of the Empire he was one of\r\nthe few distinguished literary men who took its side. The first reward\r\nthat he obtained was a professorship in the College de France; but some\r\nyears before his death he received the senatorship, a lucrative\r\nposition, and one which interfered very little with the studies of the\r\noccupant. In character Sainte-Beuve strongly resembled some of the\r\nepicureans of his favourite seventeenth century; but whatever faults he\r\nmay have had were redeemed by much good-nature and an entire absence of\r\nliterary vanity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Method.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dangers of the Method.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of Sainte-Beuve in literature is historically, and as a\r\nmatter of influence, superior even to that of the great poet with whom\r\nhe was for some time in close friendship, though before very long their\r\nstars fell apart. Until his time the science of criticism had been\r\nalmost entirely conducted on what may be called pedagogic lines. The\r\ncritic either constructed for himself, or more probably accepted from\r\ntradition, a cut-and-dried scheme of the correct plan of different kinds\r\nof literature, and contented himself with adjusting any new work to\r\nthis, marking off its agreements or differences, and judging\r\naccordingly. Here and there in French literature critics like\r\nSaint-Evremond, Fenelon, La Bruyere in part, Diderot, Joubert, had\r\nadopted another method, but the small acquaintance which most Frenchmen\r\npossessed of literature other than their own stood in the way of\r\nsuccess. Sainte-Beuve was the first to found criticism on a wide study\r\nof literature, instead of directing a more or less narrow study of\r\nliterature by critical rules. Victor Hugo himself has laid down, in the\r\npreface to the _Orientales_, one important principle--the principle that\r\nthe critic has only to judge of the intrinsic goodness of the book, and\r\nnot of its conformity to certain pre-established ideas. There remains\r\nthe difficulty of deciding what is intrinsically good or bad. To solve\r\nthis, the only way is, first, to prepare the mind of the critic by a\r\nwide study of literature, which may free him from merely local and\r\nnational prejudices; and, secondly, to direct his attention not so much\r\nto cut-and-dried ideas of an epic, a sonnet, a drama, as to the object\r\nwhich the author himself had before him when he composed his work. In\r\ncarrying out this principle it becomes obviously of great importance to\r\nstudy the man himself as well as his works, and his works as a whole as\r\nwell as the particular sample before the judge. Sainte-Beuve was almost\r\nthe first in France to set the example of the _causerie critique_, the\r\nessay which sets before the reader the life, circumstances, aims,\r\nsociety, and literary atmosphere of the author, as well as his literary\r\nachievements. This accounts for the extreme interest shown by the public\r\nin what had very commonly been regarded as one of the idlest and least\r\nprofitable kinds of literature. At the same time the method has two\r\ndangers to which it is specially exposed. One is the danger of limiting\r\nthe consideration to external facts merely, and giving a gossiping\r\nbiography rather than a criticism. The other, and the more subtle\r\ndanger, is the construction of a new cut-and-dried theory instead of the\r\nold one, by regarding every man as simply a product of his age and\r\ncircumstances, and ticketing him off accordingly without considering his\r\nworks themselves to see whether they bear out the theory by facts. In\r\neither case, the great question which Victor Hugo has stated, 'L'ouvrage\r\nest-il bon ou est-il mauvais?' remains unanswered in any satisfactory\r\nmeasure. Sainte-Beuve himself did not often fall into either error. His\r\ntaste was remarkably catholic and remarkably fine. The only fault which\r\ncan justly be found with him is the fault which naturally besets such a\r\ncritic, the tendency to look too complacently on persons of moderate\r\ntalent, whose merits he himself is perhaps the first to recognise fully,\r\nand to be proportionately unjust to the greater names whose merits, on\r\ngood systems and bad alike, are universally acknowledged, in whose case\r\nit is difficult to say anything new, and who are therefore somewhat\r\nungrateful subjects for the ingenious and delicate analysis which more\r\nmixed talents repay. But study of the work of such a man as Sainte-Beuve\r\nis an almost absolute safeguard against the intolerance of former days\r\nin matter of literature, and this is its great merit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dumas the Elder.]\r\n\r\nAround Victor Hugo were grouped not a few writers who were only inferior\r\nto himself. But, before mentioning the members of what is called the\r\n_cenacle_, or innermost Romantic circle, a third name of almost equal\r\ntemporary importance to those of Hugo and Sainte-Beuve must be\r\nnamed--that of Alexandre Dumas. This writer, one of the most prolific,\r\nand in some respects one of the most remarkable of dramatists and\r\nnovelists, was the son of a general in the revolutionary army, and was\r\nborn, on the 23rd of July, 1806, at Villers Cotterets. He had hardly any\r\neducation; but, coming to Paris at the age of twenty, he was fortunate\r\nenough to obtain a clerkship in the household of the Duke of Orleans. He\r\ntried literature almost at once, and in 1829 his _Henri III. et sa Cour_\r\nwas played, and was a great success. This was a year before _Hernani_,\r\nand though Dumas had no pretence to rival Hugo in literary merit, his\r\ndrama was quite as revolutionary in style, events, language, and general\r\narrangement as Hugo's. But he had not heralded it by any general\r\ndefiance, and it possessed (what his greater contemporary's dramatic\r\nwork never fully possessed) the indefinable knowledge of the stage and\r\nits requirements, which always tells on an audience. After the\r\nRevolution of July, the daring play of _Antony_ achieved an almost equal\r\nsuccess, despite its attacks on the proprieties, attacks of which at\r\nthat time French opinion was not tolerant in a serious play. Then he\r\nreturned to the historical drama in the _Tour de Nesle_, another play of\r\nstrong situations and reckless sacrifice of everything else to\r\nexcitement. After this Dumas published many plays, of which _Don Juan de\r\nMarana_ and _Kean_ are perhaps the most extravagant, and _Mademoiselle\r\nde Belle-Isle_, 1839, the best. But before long he fell into a train of\r\nwriting more profitable even than the drama. This was the composition of\r\nhistorical romances something in Scott's manner. The most famous of\r\nthese, such as the _Three Musketeers_, _La Reine Margot_, and _Monte\r\nCristo_, were produced towards the latter part of the reign of Louis\r\nPhilippe, his early patron. He travelled a great deal, making books and\r\nmoney out of his travels; and sometimes, as when he was the companion of\r\nGaribaldi, finding himself in curious company. No man, probably, ever\r\nmade so much money by literature in France as Dumas, though he was not\r\nequally skilled in keeping it. He died, in the midst of the disasters of\r\nhis country, on Christmas Eve, 1870. Dumas' literary position and\r\ninfluence are not very easy to estimate, because of the strange extent\r\nto which he carried what is called collaboration, and his frank avowal\r\nof something very like plagiarism in many of the works which he wrote\r\nunassisted. Endeavours have even been made to show that his most\r\ncelebrated works are the production of hack writers whom he paid to\r\nwrite under his name. Nor is there the least doubt that he did resort on\r\na large scale to something like the practice of those portrait painters\r\nwho employ their pupils to paint in the draperies, backgrounds, and\r\naccessories of their work. But that Dumas was the moving spirit still,\r\nand the actual author of what is best and most peculiar in the works\r\nthat go by his name, is sufficiently proved by the fact that none of his\r\nassistants, whose names are in many cases known, and who in not a few\r\ninstances subsequently attained eminence on their own account, have\r\nequalled or even resembled his peculiar style. Dumas' dramatic work is\r\nof but little value as literature properly so called. His forte is the\r\nalready mentioned playwright's instinct, as it may be termed, which made\r\nhim almost invariably choose and conduct his action in a manner so\r\ninteresting and absorbing to the audience that they had no time to think\r\nof the merits of the style, the propriety of the morals, the congruity\r\nof the sentiments. His plays, in short, are intended to be acted, not to\r\nbe read. Of his novels many are disfigured by long passages of the\r\ninferior work to be expected from mere hack assistants, by unskilful\r\ninsertions of passages from his authorities, and sometimes by\r\nplagiarisms so audacious and flagrant, that the reader takes them as\r\nlittle less than an insult. His best work, however, such as the whole of\r\nthe long series ranging from _Les Trois Mousquetaires_ through _Vingt\r\nAns apres_ to _Le Vicomte de Bragelonne_, a second long series of which\r\n_La Reine Margot_ is a member, and parts of others, has peculiar and\r\nalmost unique merits. The style is not more remarkable as such than that\r\nof the dramas; there is not always, or often, a well-defined plot, and\r\nthe characters are drawn only in the broadest outline. But the cunning\r\nadmixture of incident and dialogue by which Dumas carries on the\r\ninterest of his gigantic narrations without wearying the reader is a\r\nsecret of his own, and has never been thoroughly mastered by any one\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honore de Balzac.]\r\n\r\nWhile Dumas thus gave himself up to the novel of incident, two other\r\nwriters of equally remarkable genius, and of greater merely literary\r\npower, also devoted themselves to prose fiction, and by this means\r\nexercised a wide influence on their generation. Honore de Balzac was\r\nborn at Tours, on the 20th of May, 1799. He was fairly well educated,\r\nbut his father's circumstances compelled him to place his son in a\r\nlawyer's office. This Balzac could not endure, and he very shortly\r\nbetook himself to literature, suffering very considerable hardships. The\r\ntask he attempted was fiction, and his experience in it was unique. For\r\nyears he wrote steadily, and published dozens of volumes, not merely\r\nwithout attaining success, but without deserving any. But few of these\r\nare ever read now, and when they are opened it is out of mere curiosity,\r\na curiosity which meets with but little return. Yet Balzac continued, in\r\nspite of hardship and of ill success, to work on, and in his thirtieth\r\nyear he made his first mark with _Les Derniers Chouans_, a historical\r\nnovel, which, if not of great excellence, at least shows a peculiar and\r\ndecided talent. From this time forward he worked with spirit and success\r\nin his own manner, and in twenty years produced the vast collection\r\nwhich he himself termed _La Comedie Humaine_, the individual novels\r\nbeing often connected by community of personages, and always by the\r\npeculiar fashion of analytical display of character which from them is\r\nidentified with Balzac's name. The most successful of these are\r\nconcerned with Parisian life, and perhaps the most powerful of all are\r\n_Le Pere Goriot_, _Eugenie Grandet_, _La Cousine Bette_, _La Peau de\r\nChagrin_, _La Recherche de l'Absolu_, _Seraphita_. The last is the best\r\npiece of mere writing that Balzac has produced. He had also a wonderful\r\nfaculty for short tales (_Le Chef-d'oeuvre Inconnu_, _Une Passion dans\r\nle Desert_, etc.). He tried the theatre, but failed. Notwithstanding\r\nBalzac's untiring energy (he would often work for weeks together with\r\nthe briefest intervals of sleep) and the popularity of his books, he was\r\nalways in pecuniary difficulties. These were caused partly by his mania\r\nfor speculation, and partly by his singular habits of composition. He\r\nwould write a novel in short compass, have it printed, then enlarge the\r\nprinted sheets with corrections, and repeat this process again and again\r\nuntil the expenses of the mere printing swallowed up great part of the\r\nprofits of the work. At last he obtained wealth, and, as it seemed, a\r\nprospect of happiness. In 1850 he married Madame Hanska, a rich Polish\r\nlady, to whom he had been attached for many years. He had prepared for a\r\nlife of opulent ease at Paris with his wife; but a few months after his\r\nmarriage he died of heart disease. Balzac is in a way the greatest of\r\nFrench novelists, because he is the most entirely singular and original.\r\nIt has been said of him, with as much truth as exaggeration, that he has\r\ndrawn a whole world of character after having first created it out of\r\nhis own head. Balzac's characters are never quite human, and the\r\natmosphere in which they are placed has something of the same unreality\r\n(though it is for the most part tragically and not comically unreal) as\r\nthat of Dickens. Everything is seen through a kind of distorting lens,\r\nyet the actual vision is defined with the most extraordinary precision,\r\nand in the most vivid colours. Balzac had great drawbacks. Despite his\r\nnoble prefix he cannot conceive or draw either a gentleman or a lady.\r\nHis virtuous characters are usually virtuous in the theatrical sense\r\nonly; his scheme of human character is altogether low and mean. But he\r\ncan analyse vice and meanness with wonderful vigour, and he is almost\r\nunmatched in the power of conferring apparent reality upon what the\r\nreader nevertheless feels to be imaginary and ideal. It follows almost\r\nnecessarily that he is happiest when his subject has a strong touch of\r\nthe fantastic. The already mentioned _Peau de Chagrin_--a magic skin\r\nwhich confers wishing powers on its possessor but shrivels at each wish,\r\nshortening his life correspondingly--and _Seraphita_, a purely romantic\r\nor fantastic tale, are instances of this. Almost more striking than\r\neither are the _Contes Drolatiques_, tales composed in imitation of the\r\nmanner and language of the sixteenth century. Here the grotesque and\r\nfantastic incidents and tone exactly suit the writer, and some of the\r\nstories are among the masterpieces of French literature. The same\r\nsympathy with the abnormal may be noticed in the _Chef-d'oeuvre\r\nInconnu_, where a solitary painter touches and retouches his supposed\r\nmasterpiece till he loses all power of self-criticism, and at lasts\r\nexhibits triumphantly a shapeless and unintelligible daub of mingled\r\ncolours. Balzac's style is not in itself of the best; it is clumsy,\r\ninelastic, and destitute of the order and proportion which distinguish\r\nthe best French prose, but it is not ill suited to the peculiar\r\ncharacter of his work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: George Sand.]\r\n\r\nWith Balzac's name is inseparably connected, if only from the striking\r\ncontrast between them, that of George Sand. Amandine Lucile Aurore\r\nDupin, who took the writing name of George Sand, was born at Paris in\r\n1804, and had a somewhat singular family history, of which it is enough\r\nto say here that she was descended through her father's mother from\r\nMarshal Saxe, the famous son of Augustus of Saxony and Aurore von\r\nKoeningsmarck. At the age of eighteen she married a man named Dudevant,\r\nand was very unhappy, though it is rather difficult to determine on whom\r\nthe blame of the unhappiness ought to rest. They separated after a few\r\nyears, and she came to Paris, from her home at Nohant in Berry, to seek\r\na living. She found it soon in literature, having met with a friend and\r\ncompanion in the novelist Jules Sandeau, and with a stern and most\r\nuseful critic in Henri de Latouche. Her first novel of importance was\r\n_Indiana_, published in 1832. This was followed by _Valentine_, _Lelia_,\r\n_Jacques_, etc. The interest of all or most of these turns on the\r\nsufferings of the _femme incomprise_, a celebrated person in literature,\r\nof whom George Sand is the historiographer, if not the inventor. A long\r\nseries of novels of this kind gave way, between 1840 and 1849, first to\r\na series of philosophical rhapsodies, of which _Spiridion_ is the chief,\r\nand then to one in which the political aspirations of the socialist\r\nRepublicans appear. Of these, _Consuelo_, which is perhaps popularly\r\nconsidered the author's masterpiece, was the chief. Her private history\r\nwas somewhat remarkable, and she succeeded in making at least two men of\r\ngreater genius than herself, Alfred de Musset and Chopin, utterly\r\nmiserable. They, however, afforded the subjects of two noteworthy books,\r\n_Elle et Lui_, and _Lucrezia Floriani_, the latter perhaps the most\r\ncharacteristic of all her early works. After the establishment of the\r\nSecond Empire her tastes and habits became quieter. She lived chiefly,\r\nand latterly almost wholly, at Nohant, being greatly attached to the\r\ncountry; and she wrote many charming sketches of country life with\r\nfelicitous introduction of _patois_, such as _La Mare au Diable_,\r\n_Francois le Champi_, _La Petite Fadette_. Some voluminous memoirs,\r\npublished in 1854, dealt with her own early experiences. She lived till\r\nthe age of seventy-two, dying in 1876, and never ceased to put forth\r\nnovels which showed no distinct falling off in fertility or imagination,\r\nor in command of literary style. She must have written in all nearly a\r\nhundred books. As the chief characteristics of Balzac are intense\r\nobservation, concentrated thought, and the most obstinate and unwearying\r\nlabour, so the chief characteristic of George Sand is easy\r\nimprovisation. She had an active and receptive mind which took in the\r\nsurface of things, whether it was love, or philosophy, or politics, or\r\nscenery, or manners, with remarkable and indifferent facility. She had\r\nalso a style which, if it cannot be ranked among the great literary\r\nstyles from its absence of statuesque outline, and from its too great\r\nfluidity, was excellently suited for the task of improvisation. Her\r\nnovels, therefore, slipped from her without the slightest mental effort,\r\nand appear to have cost her nothing. It is not true, in this case, that\r\nwhat has cost nothing is worth nothing. But even favourable critics\r\nadmit that it is peculiarly difficult to read a novel of George Sand a\r\nsecond time, and this is perhaps a decisive test. She is, indeed, far\r\nmore of an improvising novelist than Dumas, to whom the term has more\r\noften been applied, though she wrote better French, and attempted more\r\nambitious subjects. The better characteristics of her novels reappeared,\r\nperhaps to greater advantage, in her numerous and agreeable letters,\r\nespecially those to the novelist Flaubert.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Merimee.]\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast with these three novelists was Prosper Merimee,\r\nalso a novelist for the most part, but, unlike them, a comparatively\r\ninfertile writer[292], and one of the most exquisite masters of French\r\nprose that the nineteenth century has seen. Merimee was born in 1803,\r\nand was therefore almost exactly of an age with the writers just\r\nmentioned. For a time he took a certain share in the Romantic movement,\r\nbut his distinguishing characteristic was a kind of critical cynicism,\r\npartly real, partly affected, which made him dislike and distrust\r\nexaggeration of all kinds. He accordingly soon fell off. Possessing\r\nindependent means, and entering the service of the government, he was\r\nnot obliged to write for bread, and for many years he produced little,\r\ndevoting himself as much to archaeology and the classical languages as to\r\nFrench. He accepted the Second Empire apparently from a genuine and\r\nhearty hatred of democracy, and was rewarded with the post of senator.\r\nBut he had to assist Napoleon III. in his _Caesar_, and to dance\r\nattendance on the Court, the latter duty being made somewhat less\r\nirksome to him by his personal attachment to the Empress. Two\r\ncollections of letters, which have appeared since his death, one\r\naddressed to an unknown lady, and the other to the late Sir Antonio\r\nPanizzi, while adding to Merimee's literary reputation, have thrown very\r\ncurious light on his character, exhibiting him as a man who, with very\r\ngenuine and hearty affections, veiled them under an outward cloak of\r\ncynicism, for fear of being betrayed into vulgarity and extravagance. He\r\ndied in 1870, at the beginning of the troubles of France, by which he\r\nwas deeply afflicted. The entire amount of Merimee's work is, as has\r\nbeen said, not large, and during the last twenty years of his life it is\r\nalmost insignificant. But such as it is, it has an enduring and\r\nmonumental value, which belongs to the work of few of his\r\ncontemporaries. He began by a curious practice, which united the\r\nromantic fancy for strange countries and strong local colour with his\r\npersonal longing for privacy and the absence of literary _eclat. Le\r\nTheatre de Clara Gazul_--plays, nominally by a Spanish actress--was\r\nproduced when he was but one-and-twenty; two years later, with an\r\naudacious anagram on the title of his previous work, he published, under\r\nthe title of _La Guzla_, some nominal translation of Dalmatian prose and\r\nverse, in which he utilised with extraordinary cleverness the existing\r\nbooks on Slav poetry. _La Famille de Carvajal_ was a further\r\n_supercherie_ in the same style. In the very height and climax of the\r\nRomantic movement Merimee produced two works, attesting at once his\r\nmarvellous supremacy of style, his strange critical appreciation of the\r\ncurrent forces in literature, his penetrating insight into history, and\r\nthe satiric background of all his thoughts and studies. These were _La\r\nJacquerie_, and a _Chronique du Regne de Charles IX_. These books, with\r\nBalzac's _Contes Drolatiques_ (which they long preceded), are the most\r\nhappy creative criticisms extant of the middle ages and the Renaissance\r\nin France. They are not fair or complete: on the contrary, they are\r\ndefinitely and unfairly hostile. But the mastery at once of human nature\r\nand of literary form which they display, the faculty of vivid\r\nresurrection indicated by them, the range, the insight, the power of\r\nexpression, are extraordinary. During the rest of his life Merimee, with\r\nsome excursions into history (ancient and modern), archaeology, and\r\ncriticism, confined himself for the most part to the production, at long\r\nintervals, of short tales or novels of very limited length. They are all\r\nmasterpieces of literature, and, like most masterpieces of literature,\r\nthey indicate, in a comparatively incidental and by-the-way fashion,\r\npaths which duller men have followed up to the natural result of\r\nabsurdity and exaggeration. _Colomba_, _Mateo Falcone_, _La Double\r\nMeprise_, _La Venus d'Ille_, _L'Enlevement de la Redoute_, _Lokis_, have\r\nequals, but no superiors either in French prose fiction or in French\r\nprose. Grasp of human character, reserved but masterly description of\r\nscenery, delicate analysis of motive, ability to represent the\r\nsupernatural, pathos, grandeur, simple narrative excellence, appear turn\r\nby turn in these wonderful pieces, as they appear hardly anywhere else\r\nexcept in the author to whom we shall come next. It is noteworthy,\r\nhowever, that Merimee is a master of the simple style in literature as\r\nGautier is of the ornate. One cannot be said to be greater than the\r\nother, but between them they exhibit French prose in a perfection which,\r\nsince the seventeenth century, it had not possessed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theophile Gautier.]\r\n\r\nTheophile Gautier was born considerably later than most of the writers\r\njust mentioned. His birth-year was 1811, and he was a native of Tarbes\r\nin Gascony. His education was partly at the grammar school of that town,\r\nand partly at the Lycee Charlemagne, where he made friends with Gerard\r\nde Nerval, who was destined to have a great influence on his life.\r\nAfter leaving school he was intended for the profession of art. But,\r\nlike Thackeray, to whom he had many points of resemblance, he had much\r\nless artistic faculty than taste. Gerard introduced him to the circle of\r\nVictor Hugo, and he speedily became one of the most fervent disciples of\r\nthe author of _Hernani_. In a red waistcoat which has become historic,\r\nand in a mass of long hair which he continued to wear through life, he\r\nwas the foremost of the Hugonic _claque_ at the representation of that\r\nfamous play. Young as he was, he soon justified himself as something\r\nmore than a hanger-on of great men of letters. In 1830 itself he\r\nproduced a volume of verse, and this was followed by _Albertus_, an\r\naudacious poem in the extremest Romantic style, and by a work which did\r\nhim both harm and good, _Mademoiselle de Maupin_. In this the most\r\nremarkable qualities of style and artistic conception were accompanied\r\nby a wilful disregard of the proprieties. Before long his unusual\r\ncommand of style, which was partly natural, partly founded on a wide and\r\naccurate study of the French writers of the sixteenth and early\r\nseventeenth centuries, recommended him to newspaper work, at which he\r\ntoiled manfully for the remainder of his life. There was hardly a\r\ndepartment of belles lettres which he did not attempt. He travelled in\r\nAlgeria, in Russia, in Turkey, in Spain, in Italy, in England, and wrote\r\naccounts of his travels, which are among the most brilliant ever\r\nprinted. He was an assiduous critic of art, of the drama and of\r\nliterature, and the only charge which has ever been brought against his\r\nwork in this kind is that it is usually too lenient--that his fine\r\nappreciation of even the smallest beauties has made him overlook gross\r\ndefects. His work in prose fiction was incessant, in poetry more\r\nintermittent, and all the more perfect. When the Empire established\r\nitself, Gautier, who had no political sympathies, but was, in an\r\nundecided sort of way, a conservative from the aesthetic point of view,\r\naccepted it. But he gave it no active support, beyond continuing to\r\ncontribute to the _Moniteur_, and received from it no patronage of any\r\nkind. Nor did he sacrifice the least iota of principle, insisting, in\r\nthe very face of _Les Chatiments_, on having his praise of Victor Hugo\r\ninserted in the official journal on pain of his instant resignation. He\r\nled a pleasant but laborious life in one of the suburbs of Paris, with\r\na household of sisters, daughters, and cats, to all of whom he was\r\ndeeply attached. Here he lived through the Prussian siege. On the\r\nrestoration of order he manfully grappled with his journalist work\r\nagain, all hopes of lucrative appointments having gone with the Empire.\r\nBut his health had been broken for some time, and he died in 1872. The\r\nworks by which Gautier will be remembered are, in miscellaneous prose, a\r\nremarkable series of studies on curious figures, chiefly of the\r\nseventeenth century, called _Les Grotesques_, and a companion series on\r\nthe partakers in the movement of 1830, besides his descriptive books. In\r\nnovel writing there must be mentioned an unsurpassed collection of short\r\ntales (the best of which is _La Morte Amoureuse_); _Le Roman de la\r\nMomie_, a clever _tour de force_ reviving ancient Egyptian life; and,\r\nlastly, _Le Capitaine Fracasse_, a novel in the manner of Dumas, but\r\nfashioned in his own inimitable style. In verse, he wrote, besides work\r\nalready mentioned, the _Comedie de la Mort_, some miscellaneous poems of\r\nlater date, and, finally, the _Emaux et Camees_. In prose he is, as has\r\nbeen said, the greatest recent master of the ornate style of French, as\r\nMerimee is the greatest master of the simple style. His mastery over\r\nmere language is accompanied by a very fine sense of the total form of\r\nhis tales, so that the already-mentioned _Morte Amoureuse_ is one of the\r\nunsurpassable things of literature. In general writing he has a singular\r\nfaculty of embalming the most trivial details in the amber of his style,\r\nso that his articles can be read again and again for the mere beauty of\r\nthem. As a poet he is specially noteworthy for the same command of form\r\njoined to the same exquisite perfection of language. In _Emaux et\r\nCamees_ especially it is almost impossible to find a flaw; language,\r\nmetre, arrangement, are all complete and perfect, and this formal\r\ncompleteness is further informed by abundant poetic suggestion. The\r\nchief fault, if it be a fault, which can be found with Gautier is, that\r\nhe set himself too deliberately against the tendencies of his age, and\r\nexcluded too rigidly everything but purely aesthetic subjects of interest\r\nfrom his contemplation, and from the range of his literary energy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alfred de Musset.]\r\n\r\nThe most happily-gifted, save one, of the great men of 1830, the weakest\r\nbeyond comparison in will, in temperament, in faculty of improving his\r\nnatural gifts, has yet to be mentioned. Alfred de Musset was born at\r\nParis in 1810. His father held a government place of some value; his\r\nelder brother, M. Paul de Musset, was himself a man of letters, and at\r\nthe same time deeply attached to his younger brother; and the family,\r\nthough after the death of the father their means were not great,\r\nconstantly supplied Alfred with a home. He was, fortunately or\r\nunfortunately, thrown, when quite a boy, into the society of Victor\r\nHugo, the _cenacle_ or inner clique of the Romantic movement. When only\r\nnineteen Musset published a volume of poetry, which showed in him a\r\npoetic talent inferior only to Hugo's own, and, indeed, not so much\r\ninferior as different. These _Contes d'Espagne et d'Italie_ were quickly\r\nfollowed up by a volume entitled _Un Spectacle dans un Fauteuil_, and\r\nMusset became famous. Unfortunately for him, he became intimate with\r\nGeorge Sand, and the result was a journey to Italy, from which he\r\nreturned equally broken in health and in heart. His temperament was of\r\nalmost ultra-poetic excitability, and he had a positively morbid\r\nincapacity for undertaking any useful employment, whether it was in\r\nitself congenial or no. Thus he refused a well-paid and agreeable\r\nposition in the French embassy at Madrid; and though he had written\r\nadmirable prose tales for his own pleasure, he was either unwilling or\r\nunable to write them under a regular commission. As he grew older he\r\nunfortunately became addicted to the constant and excessive use of\r\nstimulants. He was elected to the Academy in 1852, but produced little\r\nof value thereafter, and died in 1857. Alfred de Musset's work,\r\nnotwithstanding his comparatively short life and his want of regular\r\nenergy, is not inconsiderable in amount, and in quality is of the\r\nhighest merit and interest. His poems, its most important item, are\r\ndeficient in strictly formal merit. He is a very careless versifier and\r\nrhymer, and his choice of language is far from exquisite. He has,\r\nhowever, a wonderful note of genuine passion, somewhat of the Byronic\r\nkind, but quite independent in species, and entirely free from the\r\nfalsetto which spoils so much of Byron's work. Besides this his lyrics\r\nare, in what may be called 'song-quality,' scarcely to be surpassed.\r\n_Les Nuits_, a series of meditative poems in the form of dialogues\r\nbetween the poet and his muse on nights in the month of May, August,\r\nOctober, and December; _Rolla_, an extravagant but powerful tale of the\r\n_maladie du siecle_; the addresses to Lamartine and to Malibran, and a\r\nfew more poems, yield to no work of our time in genuine, original, and\r\npassionate music. Next to his poems in subject, though not in merit, may\r\nbe ranked the prose _Confession d'un Enfant du Siecle_. His prose tales,\r\n_Emmeline_, _Frederic et Bernerette_, etc., are of great merit, but\r\ninferior relatively to his poems, and to his remarkable dramas. These\r\nlatter are among the most original work of the century. It was some time\r\nbefore they commended themselves to audiences in France, but they have\r\nlong won their true position. They are of very various kinds. Some, and\r\nperhaps the happiest, are of the class called, in French, _proverbes_,\r\ndramatic illustrations, that is to say, of some common saying, _Il ne\r\nfaut jurer de rien: Il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermee_, etc.\r\nThe grace and delicacy of these, the ingenuity with which the story is\r\nadapted to the moral, the abundant wit (for wit is one of Musset's most\r\nprominent characteristics) which illustrates and pervades them, make\r\nthem unique in literature. Others, such as _Les Caprices de Marianne_,\r\n_Le Chandelier_, are regular comedies, admitting, as against the\r\nclassical tradition, that a comedy may end ill; and others, as\r\n_Lorenzaccio_, nearly attain to the dignity of the historic play. The\r\ndramatic instinct in Musset was very strong, and may, perhaps, be said\r\nto have exceeded in volume, originality, and variety, if not in\r\nintensity, the purely poetical. Altogether, Musset is the most\r\nremarkable instance in French literature, and one of the most remarkable\r\nin the literature of Europe, of merely natural genius, hardly at all\r\ndeveloped by study, and not assisted in the least by critical power and\r\na strong will. What, perhaps, distinguished him most is the singular\r\nconjunction of the most fervid passion and the most touching lyrical\r\n'cry' with the finest wit, and with unusual dramatic ability.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of the Romantic Leaders.]\r\n\r\nThese eight sum up whatever is greatest and most influential in the\r\ngeneration of 1830. Victor Hugo gave direction and leading to the\r\nmovement, identified it with his own masterly and commanding genius,\r\nfurnished it, at brief intervals, with consummate examples. Sainte-Beuve\r\nsupplied it with the necessary basis of an immense comparative\r\nerudition, by which he was enabled to disengage and to exhibit to those\r\nwho run the true principles of literary criticism, and to point the\r\nyounger generation to the sources of a richer vocabulary, a more\r\nflexible and highly-coloured style, a more cosmopolitan appreciation.\r\nAlexandre Dumas, with less strictly literary virtue than any other of\r\nthe group, occupied the important vantage grounds of the theatre and the\r\nlending library in the Romantic interest. Balzac, equalling the others\r\nin the range of his field, added the special example of a minute\r\npsychological analysis, and of the most untiring labour. George Sand\r\ntaught the secret of utilising to the utmost the passing currents of\r\npersonal and popular sentiment and thought. Merimee, the master least\r\nfollowed, supplied, in the first place, the necessary warning against a\r\ntoo enthusiastic following of school models; and, in the second, himself\r\nheld up a model of prose style of severity and exactness equal to the\r\nfinest examples of the classical school, yet possessing to the full the\r\nromantic merits of versatile adaptability, of glowing colour, of direct\r\nand fearless phrase. Gautier exhibited, on the one hand, a model of\r\nabsolute perfection in formal poetry, the workmanship of a gem or a\r\nGreek vase; on the other, the model of a prose style so flexible as to\r\nserve the most ordinary purposes, so richly equipped as to be equal to\r\nany emergency, and yet, in its most elaborate condition, worthy to rank\r\nwith his own verse. Lastly, again as an outsider (a position which he\r\nshares in the group with Merimee, though in very different fashion),\r\nMusset brought the most natural and unaffected tears and laughter by\r\nturns, to correct the too scholastic and literary character of the\r\nmovement, and to show how the most perfectly artistic effect could be\r\nproduced with the least apparatus of formal study or preparation.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence partly of these men, and directly exercised by them,\r\npartly of the general movement of which they were the leaders and\r\nexponents, the literature of France has developed itself for the rest of\r\nthe century. It remains to give a brief sketch of its principal\r\nornaments during that time. Many names, whose work is intrinsically of\r\nall but the highest interest and merit, will have to be rapidly\r\ndispatched, but their chief achievements and their significance in the\r\ngeneral march can at least be indicated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Poets of 1830.]\r\n\r\nAt the head of the poets of this minor band has to be mentioned\r\nMillevoye, who might, perhaps with equal or greater appropriateness,\r\nhave found a place in the preceding book. He is chiefly remarkable as\r\nthe author of one charming piece of sentimental verse, _La Chute des\r\nFeuilles_; and as the occasion of an immortal criticism of\r\nSainte-Beuve's, 'Il se trouve dans les trois quarts des hommes un poete\r\nqui meurt jeune tandis que l'homme survit.' The peculiarity of Millevoye\r\nand his happiness was that he did not survive the death of the poet in\r\nhim, but died at the age of thirty-four. Except the piece just\r\nmentioned, he wrote little of value, and his total work is not large.\r\nBut he may be described as a simpler, a somewhat less harmonious, but a\r\nless tautologous Lamartine, to whom the gods were kind in allowing him\r\nto die young. A curious contrast to Millevoye is furnished by his\r\ncontemporary, Ulric Guttinguer. Guttinguer was born in 1785, and, like\r\nNodier, he joined himself frankly to the Romantic movement, and was\r\nlooked up to as a senior by its more active promoters. Like Millevoye,\r\nhe has to rest his fame almost entirely on one piece, the verses\r\nbeginning, 'Ils ont dit: l'amour passe et sa flamme est rapide;' but,\r\nunlike him, he lived to a great age, and was a tolerably fertile\r\nproducer. By the side of these two poets ranks Marceline\r\nDesbordes-Valmore, who shares, with Louise Labe and Marie de France, the\r\nfirst rank among the poetesses of her country. Madame Desbordes-Valmore\r\nwas born in 1787, and died in 1859. Her first volume of poems was\r\npublished in 1819, and, as in all the verse of this time, the note of\r\nsentiment dominates. She continued to publish volumes at intervals until\r\n1843, and another was added after her death. Great sweetness and pathos,\r\nwith a total absence of affectation, distinguish her work. Perhaps her\r\nbest piece is the charming song, in a kind of irregular rondeau form,\r\n_S'il avait su_. Jean Polonius, whose real name was Labenski, was a\r\nRussian, who contributed frequently to the _Annales Romantiques_, and\r\nsubsequently published two volumes of French poetry. Emile and Antoni\r\nDeschamps were the translators of the Romantic movement. Antoni\r\naccomplished a complete translation of Dante, Emile translated from\r\nEnglish, German, and Italian poets indifferently. They also published\r\noriginal poems together, and separately. Madame Tastu was also a\r\ntranslator, or rather a paraphraser, and an author of original poems of\r\na sentimental kind. Lastly, Jean Reboul, a native of Nimes, and born in\r\na humble situation, deserves a place among these.\r\n\r\nThree poets deserving of all but the first rank, and belonging to the\r\ngeneration of 1830 itself, require each a somewhat longer notice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alfred de Vigny.]\r\n\r\nAlfred de Vigny was born at Loches, on the 27th of March, 1799. He was a\r\nman of rank, and his marriage in 1826 with an Englishwoman of wealth\r\ngave him independence. He left the army, in which he had served for some\r\nyears, in 1828, and spent the rest of his life, until his death in 1864,\r\nin literary ease. He had been for some time a member of the Academy. His\r\npoetical career was peculiar. Between 1821 and 1829 he produced a small\r\nnumber of poems of the most exquisite finish, which at once attained the\r\npopularity they deserved, and were repeatedly reprinted. But for\r\nthirty-five years he published hardly anything else in verse, his\r\n_Poemes Philosophiques_ not appearing (at least as a volume) until after\r\nhis death. Yet he was by no means idle. He had written and published in\r\n1826 the prose romance of _Cinq Mars_, and he followed this up, though\r\nat considerable intervals, with others, as well as with dramas, of which\r\n_Chatterton_ is the best and best known. He also translated _Othello_\r\nand _The Merchant of Venice_. Alfred de Vigny may perhaps be best\r\ndescribed as a link between Andre Chenier and the Romantic poets. He is\r\nnot much of a lyrist, his best and most famous poems (_Moise_, _Eloa_,\r\n_Dolorida_) being in Alexandrines, and the general form of his verse\r\ninclines to that of the eighteenth-century elegy, while it has much of\r\nthe classical (not pseudo-classical) proportion and grace of Chenier.\r\nBut his language, and in part his versification, are romantic, though\r\nquieter in style than those of most of his companions, whom it must be\r\nremembered he for the most part forestalled. In _Moise_ much of what has\r\nbeen called Victor Hugo's 'science of names' is anticipated, as well as\r\nhis large manner of landscape and declamation. _Eloa_ suggests rather\r\nLamartine, but a Lamartine with his weakness replaced by strength, while\r\n_Dolorida_ has a strong flavour of Musset. The remarkable thing is that\r\nin each case the peculiarities of the poet to whom Vigny has been\r\ncompared were not fully developed until after he wrote, and that\r\ntherefore he has the merit of originality. It is probable, however,\r\nthat, exquisite as his poetical power was, it lacked range, and that he,\r\nhaving the rare faculty of discerning this, designedly limited his\r\nproduction. The best of the posthumous poems already mentioned are fully\r\nworthy of his earlier ones, but they display no new faculty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Auguste Barbier.]\r\n\r\nIf Alfred de Vigny is a poet of few books, Auguste Barbier is a poet of\r\none. Born in 1805, Barbier never formed part of the Romantic circle,\r\nproperly so called, but he shared to the full its inspiring influence.\r\nHe began by an historical novel of no great merit, but the revolution of\r\n1830 served as the occasion of his _Iambes_, a series of extraordinarily\r\nbrilliant and vigorous satires, both political and social. The most\r\nfamous of all these is _La Curee_, a description of the ignoble scramble\r\nfor place and profit under the new Orleanist government. No satirical\r\nwork in modern days has had greater success, and few have deserved it\r\nmore; the weight and polish of the verse being altogether admirable.\r\nSatire is, however, a vein which it is very difficult to work for any\r\nlength of time with any novelty, as may be seen sufficiently from the\r\nfact that the works of all the best satirists, ancient and modern, are\r\ncontained in a very small compass. Barbier endeavoured to secure the\r\nnecessary variety of subjects by going to Italy in _Il Pianto_, and to\r\nEngland in _Lazare_, but without success, though both contain many\r\nexamples of the nervous and splendid verse in which he excels. During\r\nthe last forty years of his life he wrote much, and he was elected to\r\nthe Academy in 1869, but _Les Iambes_ will remain his title to fame.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gerard de Nerval.]\r\n\r\nA name far less generally known, but deserving of being known very well\r\nindeed, is that of Gerard de Nerval, or, as his right appellation was,\r\nGerard Labrunie. He was born in 1805, and was one of the most\r\ndistinguished pupils of the celebrated Lycee Charlemagne, where he made\r\nthe acquaintance of Theophile Gautier. Gerard (as he is most generally\r\ncalled) was a man of delicate and far-ranging genius, afflicted with the\r\npeculiar malady which weighs on some such men, and which may perhaps be\r\ndescribed as an infirmity of will. He was not idle, and there was no\r\nreason why he should not be prosperous. At an early age he translated\r\n_Faust_, to the admiration of Goethe. His _Travels in the East_ were\r\nwidely read, and every newspaper in Paris was glad of his co-operation;\r\nyet he was frequently in distress, and died in a horrible and mysterious\r\nmanner, either by his own hand or murdered by night prowlers. He has\r\nbeen more than once compared to Poe, whom, however, he excelled both in\r\namiability of temperament and in literary knowledge. But the two have\r\nbeen rightly selected by an excellent judge as being, in company with a\r\nliving English poet, the chief masters of the poetry which 'lies on the\r\nfurther side between verse and music.' Most of Gerard's work is in\r\nprose, taking the form of fantastic but exquisite short tales entitled\r\n_Les Filles de Feu_, _La Boheme Galante_, etc. His verse, at least the\r\ncharacteristic part of it, is not bulky; it consists partly of folksongs\r\nslightly modernised, partly of sonnets, partly of miscellaneous poems.\r\nBut, if the expression 'prose poetry' be ever allowable, which has been\r\ndoubted, it is seldom more applicable than to much of Gerard de Nerval's\r\nwork, both in his description of his travels and in avowed fiction.\r\n\r\nSome minor names remain to be mentioned. Mery, one of the most fertile\r\nauthors of the century, was a writer of verse as well as of prose, and\r\ndisplayed much the same talent of brilliant improvisation in each\r\ncapacity. Auguste Brizeux, a Breton by birth, made himself remarkable by\r\nidyllic poetry (_Marie_, _La Fleur d'Or_) chiefly dealing with the\r\nscenery and figures of his native province. Amedee Pommier is a fertile\r\nand not inelegant verse writer, of no very marked characteristics.\r\nCharles Dovalle, who was shot in one of the miserable duels between\r\njournalists so common in France, at the age of twenty-two, would\r\nprobably have done remarkable work had he lived. Hegesippe Moreau, to\r\nwhom a life but very little longer was vouchsafed, devoted himself\r\npartly to bacchanalian and satirical work, for which he had not the\r\nslightest genius, but produced also some poems of country life, which\r\nrank among the sweetest and most natural of the century. Much of his\r\nwork is little more than a corrupt following of Beranger. In the same\r\nway the imitation of Lamartine was not fortunate for Victor de Laprade\r\n(_Psyche_, _Les Symphonies_, _Les Voix de Silence_). This imitation is\r\nnot so much in subject (for M. de Laprade was a philosopher rather than\r\na sentimentalist) as in manner and versification. His verse is also much\r\nmore strongly impregnated than Lamartine's with classical culture. With\r\ndue allowance for difference of dates and countries, there is a\r\nconsiderable resemblance between Laprade and Southey. Both had the same\r\naccomplishment of style, the same unquestioning submission to the dogmas\r\nof Christianity, the same width of literary information. It is\r\nunfortunate for France that Laprade was somewhat deficient in humour, a\r\nrare growth on her soil at all times.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Curiosites Romantiques.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Petrus Borel.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Bertrand.]\r\n\r\nAll these names are more or less widely known, but there is a class of\r\n'oublies et dedaignes,' as one of their most faithful biographers has\r\ncalled them, who belong to the movement of 1830, and whose numbers are\r\nprobably, while their merit is certainly, greater than is the case at\r\nany other literary epoch. Few of them can be mentioned here, but those\r\nfew are worthy of mention, and it may perhaps be said that the native\r\nvigour of most of them, though warped and distorted for the most part by\r\noddities of temperament or the unkindness of fortune, equals, if it does\r\nnot surpass, that of many of their more fortunate brethren. The first of\r\nthese is Petrus Borel, one of the strangest figures in the history of\r\nliterature. Very little is known of his life, which was spent partly at\r\nParis and partly in Algeria. He was perhaps the most extravagant of all\r\nthe Romantics, surnaming himself 'Le Lycanthrope,' and identifying\r\nhimself with the eccentricities of the _Bousingots_, a clique of\r\npolitical literary men who for a short time made themselves conspicuous\r\nafter 1830. Borel wrote partly in verse and partly in prose. His most\r\nconsiderable exploit in the former was a strange preface in verse to his\r\nnovel of _Madame Putiphar_; his best work in prose, a series of wild but\r\npowerful stories entitled _Champavert_. His talent altogether lacked\r\nmeasure and criticism, but it is undeniable. Auguste Fontaney was born\r\nin 1803 and died in 1837, having, like many of the literary men of his\r\nday, served for a short time in diplomacy. He was a frequent contributor\r\nto the early Romantic periodicals, and somewhat later to the _Revue des\r\nDeux-Mondes_. His work is very unequal, but at its best it is saturated\r\nwith the true spirit of poetry. Felix Arvers, like our own Blanco White,\r\nhas obtained his place in literary history by a single sonnet, one of\r\nthe most beautiful ever written. Auguste de Chatillon was both poet and\r\npainter; his chief title to remembrance in the former capacity being a\r\nvolume of cheerful verse entitled _A l'Auberge de la Grand' Pinte_.\r\nNapoleon Peyrat, who, after the fashion of those times (in which Auguste\r\nMaquet, a fertile novelist, and a journalist, and a collaborateur of\r\nAlexandre Dumas, called himself Augustus Mackeat, and Theophile Dondey\r\nanagrammatised his surname into O'Neddy), dubbed himself Napol le\r\nPyreneen, survives, and justly, in virtue of a single short poem on\r\n_Roland_, possessed of extraordinary _verve_ and spirit. Last of all has\r\nto be mentioned Louis Bertrand, a poet possessed of the rarest faculty,\r\nbut unfortunately doomed to misfortune and premature death. Born at Ceva\r\nin Piedmont, in 1807, and brought up at Dijon, he came to Paris, found\r\nthere but scanty encouragement, and died in a hospital in 1841. His only\r\nwork of any importance, _Gaspard de la Nuit_, a series of prose ballads\r\narranged in verses something like those of the English translation of\r\nthe Bible, and testifying to the most delicate sense of rhythm, and the\r\nmost exquisite power of poetical suggestion, did not appear until after\r\nhis death. He and Borel perhaps only of the names contained in this\r\nparagraph represent individual and solid talent: the others are chiefly\r\nnoteworthy as instances of the extraordinary stimulating force of the\r\ntime on minds which in other days would probably have remained indocile\r\nto poetry, or at least unproductive of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Group of Romantic Poets.]\r\n\r\nThree distinct stages are perceptible in French poetry since the date of\r\nthe Romantic movement, and we have now exhausted the remarkable names\r\nbelonging to the first. Another opens with those poets who, being born\r\nin or about 1820, came to years of discretion in time to see the first\r\nforce of the movement spent, and found the necessity of striking out\r\nsomething of a new way for themselves. Of this group three names stand\r\npre-eminently forward, those of Baudelaire, Banville, and Leconte de\r\nLisle, while some others may be mentioned beside them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theodore de Banville.]\r\n\r\nTheodore de Banville was born in 1820, of a good family, his father\r\nbeing an officer in the navy. He began to write very early with the\r\n_Cariatides_, and continued for fifty years to be active in prose and\r\npoetry. M. de Banville displayed at once a remarkable mastery of rhyme\r\nand rhythm, and it is in the exhibition of this that he chiefly\r\nexcelled. Under his auspices not merely the graceful metrical systems of\r\nthe Pleiade, but the older forms of the mediaeval poets, Ballades,\r\nRondeaux, Triolets, etc., were once more brought into fashion. But M. de\r\nBanville was by no means only a clever versifier. His serious poetry\r\n(_Cariatides_, _Stalactites_, _Odelettes_, _Les Exile's_, _Trente-six\r\nBallades_) is full of poetical language and sentiment, his lighter verse\r\n(_Occidentales_, _Odes Funambulesques_) is charming, his prose is\r\nexcellent, and he was no mean hand at drama (_Gringoire_).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leconte de Lisle.]\r\n\r\nAs M. de Banville sought for poetical novelty in an elaborate\r\nmanipulation of the formal part of poetry, so M. Leconte de Lisle has\r\nsought it in a wide range of subject. He is a great translator of Greek\r\nverse. But in his original poems (_Poesies Antiques_, _Poesies\r\nBarbares_, _Poemes et Poesies_) he has gone not merely to the classics\r\nbut to the East and to mediaeval times for his inspiration. A tendency\r\nto load his verse with exotic names in unusual forms (he was one of the\r\nfirst Frenchmen to adopt the fashion of spelling Greek names with a\r\nstrict transliteration) has brought, not perhaps altogether\r\nundeservedly, the charge of affectation on M. Leconte de Lisle. But he\r\nis a poet of no small power, not merely in outlandish subjects such as\r\n_Le Massacre de Mona_, _Le Sommeil du Condor_, _Le Runoia_, etc., but in\r\nmuch simpler work, such as the beautiful _Requies_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles Baudelaire.]\r\n\r\nCharles Baudelaire had a more original talent than either of these.\r\nAlthough a very careful writer, he is not studious of bizarre rhythm,\r\nnor are his subjects for the most part outlandish. He chose, however, to\r\nillustrate a peculiar form of poetical melancholy by dwelling on\r\nsubjects many of which would have been better left alone, while others\r\nwere treated in a manner unsuited to the time. His _Fleurs du Mal_,\r\ntherefore, as his chief work is entitled, had to undergo expurgation\r\nbefore it was allowed to be published, and has never been popular with\r\nthe general public. But its best pieces, as well as the best of some\r\nsingular _Petits Poemes en Prose_, partly inspired by Louis Bertrand,\r\nhave extraordinary merit in the way of delicate poetical suggestion and\r\na lofty spiritualism. Baudelaire was also a very accomplished critic,\r\nhis point of view being less exclusively French than that of almost any\r\nother French writer of the same class. He translated Poe and De Quincey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Poets of the Second Romantic Group.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dupont.]\r\n\r\nThe minor poets of this second Romantic school may again be grouped\r\ntogether. Charles Coran, a miscellaneous poet of talent, anticipated the\r\nschool of which we shall shortly have to give some notice, that of the\r\n_Parnassiens_. Josephin Soulary is remarkable for the extreme beauty of\r\nhis sonnets, in devoting himself to which form he anticipated a general\r\ntendency of contemporary poets both English and French. Auguste\r\nVacquerie, better known as a critic, a dramatist, and a journalist,\r\nbegan as a lyrical and miscellaneous poet, and achieved some noticeable\r\nwork. Gustave Le Vavasseur attempted, not without success, to revive the\r\nvigorous tradition of Norman poetry. Pierre Dupont, better known than\r\nany of these, seemed at one time likely to be a poet of the first rank,\r\nbut unfortunately wasted his talent in Bohemian dawdling and disorder.\r\nHis songs were the delight of the young generation of 1848, and two of\r\nthem, _Le Chant des Ouvriers_ and _Les Boeufs_, are still most\r\nremarkable compositions. Louis Bouilhet (whose best poem is _Melaenis_)\r\nhas some resemblance to M. Leconte de Lisle, though he went still\r\nfurther afield for his subjects. He had no small power, but the defect\r\nof the old descriptive poetry revived in him, and in some of his\r\ncontemporaries and followers, the defect necessarily attendant on\r\nforgetfulness of the fact that description by itself, however beautiful\r\nit may be, is not poetry. With these may be mentioned Gustave Nadaud, a\r\nsong-writer pure and simple, free from almost any influence of school\r\nliterature, a true follower of Beranger, though with much less range,\r\nwit, and depth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Parnasse.]\r\n\r\nExcept Dupont and Nadaud, all the poets just mentioned may be said to\r\nbelong more or less to the school of Gautier--the school, that is to\r\nsay, which attached preponderant importance to form in poetry. Towards\r\nthe middle of the Second Empire a crowd of younger writers, who had\r\nadopted this principle still more unhesitatingly, grew up, and formed\r\nwhat has been known for some years, partly seriously, partly in\r\nderision, as the _Parnassien_ school. The origin of this term was the\r\nissue, in 1866 (as a sort of poetical manifesto preluding the great\r\nExhibition of the next year), of a collection of poetry from the pens of\r\na large number of poets, from Theophile Gautier and Emile Deschamps\r\ndownwards. This was entitled _Le Parnasse Contemporain_, after an old\r\nFrench fashion. Another collection of the same kind was begun in 1869,\r\ninterrupted by the war, and continued afterwards; and a third in 1876:\r\nwhile the _Parnassien_ movement was also represented in several\r\nnewspapers, the chief of which was _La Renaissance_. Another nickname of\r\nthe poets of this sect (which, however, included almost all French\r\nwriters of verse, even Victor de Laprade being counted in) was _les\r\nimpassibles_, for their presumed devotion to art for art's sake, and\r\ntheir scorn of didactic, domestic, and sentimental poetry. Their numbers\r\nwere very great, and none, save a few, can be mentioned here. Perhaps\r\nthe chief of the original _Parnassiens_ were MM. Sully Prudhomme and\r\nFrancois Coppee, the former of whom experienced some reaction and\r\naffected what is called 'thoughtful verse,' while M. Coppee, having\r\ntaken to domestic subjects, is as popular as any contemporary French\r\npoet, and in at least one instance (_Le Luthier de Cremone_) has\r\nachieved success at the theatre. A poet of great gifts, the latest of\r\nthe vagabond school of Villon, was Albert Glatigny, who lived as a\r\nstrolling actor, and died young. Many of his poems, but especially the\r\n_Ballade des Enfans sans Souci_, have singular force and pathos. It\r\nwould hardly be fair to mention any other names, because a singular\r\nevenness of talent and general characteristics manifests itself among\r\nthese poets. All sacrifice something to the perfection of form, or, to\r\nspeak more correctly and critically, most are saved only by the\r\nperfection of their form, which is as a rule far superior to that of\r\nEnglish minor poets. Of late years the _Parnasse_ as a single group has\r\nbroken up somewhat, and during the last decade some isolated poets of\r\npromise have appeared. M. Maurice Bouchor recurred to the bacchanalian\r\nmodel for inspiration; M. Paul Deroulede is tyrtaean and bellicose. Both\r\nof these may be said to be representative of reaction against the\r\n_Parnasse_. The new naturalist school, which has produced such singular\r\nwork in prose fiction, is represented in poetry by M. Richepin and M.\r\nGuy de Maupassant. The former, with much unworthy work, produced in _La\r\nMer_ and elsewhere excellent things. The latter, despite an unfortunate\r\nlicence of subject, showed himself the strongest and most accomplished\r\nversifier who has made his appearance in France for the last twenty\r\nyears. But after his first efforts he appeared to abandon himself almost\r\nentirely to prose. M. Paul Verlaine, a poet known from the early days of\r\nthe Parnasse, has more recently produced work of increased but very\r\nunequal merit, exaggerating the faults but showing some of the charm of\r\nBaudelaire; and, partly under his, partly under foreign influence, a\r\nstill younger school has begun to make experiments in prosody which are\r\nnot uninteresting, but which are too minute for notice here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor and later Dramatists.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scribe.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ponsard.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emile Augier.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eugene Labiche.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dumas the Younger.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victorien Sardou.]\r\n\r\nThe progress of French drama during the last half century is of somewhat\r\nless importance to literature, but of even more to social history, than\r\nthat of poetry. The greatest masters of drama have already been\r\nmentioned among the eight typical names of 1830, even Balzac having\r\nattempted it, though without much success. The most famous and\r\nsuccessful playwrights, however, as distinguished from the producers of\r\nliterary dramas, have yet to be noticed[293]. Pixerecourt, a\r\nmelodramatist and a book-collector, achieved his first success with a\r\nplay on the well-known story of the Dog of Montargis (itself dating back\r\nto the earliest days of the Chansons de Gestes), in 1814, and followed\r\nit up with a long succession of similar pieces. Two years later Eugene\r\nScribe, who had been born in 1791, made his _debut_, as far as success\r\ngoes, with _Une Nuit de la Garde Nationale_. Scribe was one of the most\r\nprolific, one of the most successful, and one of the least literary of\r\nFrench dramatists. For nearly half a century he continued, sometimes\r\nalone, and sometimes in collaboration, to pour forth vaudevilles,\r\ndramas, and comedies, almost all of which were favourably received.\r\nScribe was generous to his associates, and would sometimes acknowledge\r\nthe communication of a bare idea by a share in the profits of the play\r\nwhich it suggested. He had also an almost unrivalled knowledge of the\r\n_technique_ of the theatre, and not a little wit. But his style is loose\r\nand careless, and his dramas do not bear reading. His most important\r\nlater plays are _Valerie_, 1822; _Le Mariage d'Argent_, 1827; _Bertrand\r\net Raton_, 1833; _Le Verre d'Eau_, 1840; _Une Chaine_, 1841; _Bataille\r\nde Dames_, 1851. One of the less famous partakers in the first Romantic\r\nmovement, Bouchardy, distinguished himself, in succession to\r\nPixerecourt, as a Romantic melodramatist, his most famous works being\r\n_Le Sonneur de Saint Paul_, and _Lazare le Patre_. In 1843 a kind of\r\nreaction was supposed to be about to take place, the signs of which were\r\nthe performance of the _Lucrece_ of Ponsard in that year, and of the\r\n_Cigue_ of Emile Augier the year after. Ponsard, however, was only a\r\nRomantic whose colour was deadened by his inability to attain more\r\nbrilliant tones. His succeeding plays, _Agnes de Meranie_, _Charlotte\r\nCorday_, _L'Honneur et l'Argent_, showed this sufficiently. M. Emile\r\nAugier is a more remarkable and a more independent figure. In so far as\r\nhe represents a protest against Romanticism at all (which he does only\r\nvery partially), it is because he shared in the growing tendency towards\r\nrealism, that is, to a recurrence in the Romantic sense to the _tragedie\r\nbourgeoise_ of the preceding century, and because also he gave no\r\ncountenance to the practice, in which some of the early Romantics\r\nindulged, of representing immoral personages as interesting. Almost all\r\nM. Augier's dramas, such as _L'Aventuriere_, 1849, which is his\r\nmasterpiece, _Gabrielle_, 1849, _Diane_, 1852, _Le Mariage d'Olympe_,\r\n1855, _Le Fils de Giboyer_, 1862, and others of more recent date, are\r\ndistinctly on the side of the angels. But the author does not make the\r\nexcellence of his intention a reason for passing off inferior work, and\r\nhe is justly recognised as one of the leaders of French drama in the\r\nlatter half of the century. About this same time (1845) was the date of\r\nthe appearance of a fertile and successful playwright of the less\r\nexalted class, M. Dennery (_Don Cesar de Bazan_, _L'Aieule_). Auguste\r\nMaquet, another of the old guard of Romanticism, distinguished himself\r\nby helping to adapt to the stage the novels of Dumas the elder, which he\r\nhad already helped to write; and one of his colleagues on Dumas' staff,\r\nM. Octave Feuillet, who was shortly to make a great reputation for\r\nhimself as a novelist, appeared on the boards with _Echec et Mat_.\r\nDuring the whole of this decade (1840-1850) Delphine Gay, the beautiful\r\nand accomplished wife of the journalist Emile de Girardin, was a\r\nfrequent and successful play-writer. Soon afterwards M. Legouve, son of\r\nthe academician of the same name, and himself an academician, began to\r\ncollaborate with Scribe in works of more importance (_Adrienne\r\nLecouvreur_) than the latter had before attempted; while George Sand and\r\nher former friend, Jules Sandeau, were also drawn into the inevitable\r\ntheatrical vortex. In collaboration with Augier, Sandeau produced, from\r\none of his own novels, one of the best plays of the century, _Le Gendre\r\nde M. Poirier_, 1855. Eugene Labiche, who had been born in 1815,\r\ndistinguished himself, in 1851, by _Le Chapeau de Paille d'Italie_, and\r\nin it laid the foundation of a long career of success in the lighter\r\nkind of play which, at last, conducted him to the Academy. His\r\nbest-known play is _Le Voyage de M. Perrichon_. The year 1852 was\r\nmemorable for the French stage, for it saw the production of _La Dame\r\naux Camelias_, the first important play of Alexandre Dumas _fils_.\r\nWithout much of his father's talent for novel-writing, M. Dumas has been\r\nboth a more successful, and perhaps a better, dramatist. Most of his\r\nplays have been directed to some burning question of the social or\r\nethical kind, and it has been his practice to re-issue them after a\r\ntime, with argumentative prefaces, in a very singular style. _Diane de\r\nLys_, _Le Demi-Monde_, _La Question d'Argent_, _Le Fils Naturel_, _Le\r\nSupplice d'une Femme_ (nominally composed with Emile de Girardin), _Les\r\nIdees de Madame Aubray_, _Une Visite de Noces_, and _L'Etrangere,_ are\r\nhis chief works. In 1854 appeared a now almost forgotten work by\r\nVictorien Sardou, who was destined to be the favourite dramatist of the\r\nSecond Empire, and to share with MM. Augier and Dumas _fils_ the chief\r\nrank among the dramatists of the last half of the century. Seven years\r\nlater _Nos Intimes_ gave him a great success, and, in 1865, _La Famille\r\nBenoiton_ a greater, which he followed up with _Nos Bons Villageois_,\r\n1866. Since that time he has written many plays, of which the finest by\r\nfar, and one of the few comedies of this age likely to become classical,\r\nis the admirable _Rabagas_--a satire of the keenest on the interested\r\npoliticians, who, in France as elsewhere, take up demagogy as a trade.\r\nM. Sardou has attempted serious work in various plays, the best of which\r\nis, perhaps, _Patrie_, but it is not his forte. Satirical observation of\r\nmanners, and especially of the current political and social follies of\r\nthe day, is what he can do best, and in this peculiar line he has few\r\nequals. But he is admitted to be one of the most unequal of writers. A\r\npeculiar offspring of the Second Empire are the brilliant burlesques of\r\nOffenbach, which owed at least part of their brilliancy to the librettos\r\ncomposed for them by MM. Meilhac and Halevy. The first-named of these\r\nhad produced successful dramas as far back as 1859. The collaborateurs\r\ndid not confine themselves to furnishing words for M. Offenbach's music,\r\nbut attempted the prose drama frequently and with success, _Froufrou_\r\nbeing their most important work in this way. M. Gondinet and M.\r\nPailleron also deserve notice as successful manufacturers of light\r\nplays, the latter in especial having an excellent wit (_Le monde ou l'on\r\ns'ennuie_, _Le Chevalier Trumeau_). This may also be asserted of M.\r\nHalevy, who has latterly, in _Les Petites Cardinal_ and other\r\nnon-dramatic sketches, shown himself to even greater advantage than on\r\nthe stage. Indeed the Cardinal family may be said to be the most\r\nstriking literary creation of its kind for years.\r\n\r\nIn a different class and earlier, Joseph Autran, a poet of the school of\r\nLamartine, obtained a great reputation by his tragedy of _La Fille\r\nd'Eschyle_, which procured him a seat in the Academy, and gave him the\r\nopportunity of writing not a few volumes of polished, but not very\r\nvigorous, poetry. M. Theodore de Banville, who has tried most paths in\r\nliterature, produced, in 1866, a short play, with the old mystery-writer\r\nGringoire for hero and title-giver; a play which is admirably written,\r\nand which has kept its place on the stage. M. Francois Coppee's graceful\r\n_Luthier de Cremone_ has already been mentioned. Another literary\r\ndramatist, to distinguish the class from those who are playwrights first\r\nof all, is M. Henri de Bornier, who obtained some success, in 1875, with\r\n_La Fille de Roland_, and, in 1880, with _Les Noces d'Attila_. Both\r\nthese are good, though not consummate, specimens of the poetical drama.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Classes of Nineteenth-Century Fiction.]\r\n\r\nActive, however, as was the cultivation of poetry proper and of the\r\ndrama, it is not likely that the nineteenth century will be principally\r\nknown in French literary history either as a poetical, or as a dramatic\r\nage. Its most creative production is in the field of prose fiction. It\r\nis particularly noteworthy that every one of the eight names which have\r\nbeen set at its head is the name of a novelist, and that the energy of\r\nmost of these authors in novel-writing has been very considerable. Their\r\nproduction may be divided into two broad classes--novels of incident, of\r\nwhich Hugo and Dumas were the chief practitioners, and which derive\r\nchiefly from Sir Walter Scott; and novels of character, which, with a\r\nnot inconsiderable admixture of English influence, may be said to be\r\nlegitimately descended from the indigenous novel created by Madame de la\r\nFayette, continued by Marivaux and still more by Prevost, and\r\nmaintained, though in diminished vivacity, by later writers. Of this\r\nschool George Sand and Balzac are the masters, though much importance\r\nmust also be assigned to Stendhal. At first the novelists of 1830\r\ndecidedly preferred the novel of incident, the literary success of which\r\nin the hands of Hugo, and its pecuniary success in the hands of Dumas,\r\nwere equally likely to excite ambitions of different kinds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor and later Novelists.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jules Janin.]\r\n\r\nA rival of both of these in popularity during the reign of Louis\r\nPhilippe, though infinitely inferior to both in literary skill, was\r\nEugene Sue. With him may be classed another voluminous manufacturer of\r\nexciting stories, Frederic Soulie, and somewhat later Paul Feval, with\r\nnext to them Amedee Achard and Roger de Beauvoir. A better writer than\r\nany of these was Jules Janin, whose literary career was long and\r\nprosperous, but not uniform. Janin began with a strange story, in the\r\nextremest Romantic taste, called _L'Ane Mort et la Femme Guillotinee_.\r\nThis at a later period he represented as an intentional caricature,\r\nwhich is not on the whole likely. He followed it up with _Barnave_, a\r\nhistorical novel full of exciting incident. Both these books, however,\r\nwith grave defects, have power perhaps superior to that shown in\r\nanything that Janin did later. Being an exceedingly facile writer, and\r\nlacking that peculiar quality of style which sometimes precludes\r\npopularity with the many as much as it secures it with the few, he\r\nbecame absorbed in journalism, in the furnishing of miscellaneous\r\narticles, prefaces, and so forth, to the booksellers, and finally in\r\ntheatrical criticism, where he reigned supreme for many years. None of\r\nhis later novels need remark. With Janin may be mentioned M. Alphonse\r\nKarr, who however has been more of a journalist than of a novelist. His\r\nabundant and lively work has not perhaps the qualities of permanence.\r\nBut his _Voyage autour de mon Jardin_, his _Sous les Tilleuls_, and the\r\nsatirical publication known as _Les Guepes_, deserve at least to be\r\nnamed. Here too may be noticed M. Barbey d'Aurevilly whose works\r\ncritical and fictitious (the chief being probably _L'Ensorcelee_)\r\ndisplay a very remarkable faculty of style, perhaps too deliberately\r\neccentric, but full of distinction and vigour.\r\n\r\nUnder the Empire, a fresh group of novelists of incident sprang up. MM.\r\nErckmann and Chatrian produced in collaboration a large number of tales,\r\nchiefly dealing with the events of the Revolution and the First Empire\r\nin the north-eastern provinces of France. Criminal and legal subjects\r\nwere great favourites with the late Emile Gaboriau, who naturalised in\r\nFrance the detective novel. His chief follower is M. Fortune du\r\nBoisgobey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles de Bernard.]\r\n\r\nThe best novelists of the generation of 1830, outside the list of\r\nmasters, have yet to be noticed. These are Charles de Bernard and Jules\r\nSandeau. Charles de Bernard was at one time Balzac's secretary, but his\r\nfashion of work is entirely different from that of his employer. He\r\ndivides himself for the most part between the representation of the\r\nParisian life of good society and that of country-house manners. His\r\nshorter tales are perhaps his best, and many of them, such as\r\n_L'Ecueil_, _La Quarantaine_, _Le Paratonnerre_, _Le Gendre_, etc., are\r\nadmirable examples of a class in which Frenchmen have always excelled.\r\nBut his longer works, _Gerfaut_, _Les Ailes d'Icare_, _Un Homme\r\nSerieux_, etc., are not inferior to them in wit, in accurate knowledge\r\nand skilful portraiture of character, in good breeding, and in satiric\r\ntouches which are always good-humoured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jules Sandeau.]\r\n\r\nJules Sandeau was a novelist of no very different class, but with less\r\nwit, with much less satiric intention, and with a greater infusion of\r\nsentiment, not to say tragedy. His best novels, _Catherine_,\r\n_Mademoiselle de Penarvan_, _Mademoiselle de la Seigliere_, _Le Docteur\r\nHerbeau_, are drawn from provincial life, which, from the great size of\r\nFrance and its diversity in scenery and local character, has been a\r\nremarkably fertile subject to French novelists. These novels are\r\nremarkable for their accurate and dramatic construction (which is such\r\nthat they have lent themselves in more than one instance to theatrical\r\nadaptation with great success) and their pure and healthy morality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octave Feuillet.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murger.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edmond About.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Feydeau.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gustave Droz]\r\n\r\nNext in order of birth may be mentioned Octave Feuillet, who began, as\r\nhas been mentioned, by officiating as assistant to Alexandre Dumas. His\r\nfirst independent efforts in novel-writing, _Bellah_ and _Onesta_, were\r\nof the same kind as his master's; but they were not great successes, and\r\nafter a short time he struck into an original and much more promising\r\npath. His first really characteristic novel was _La Petite Comtesse_,\r\n1856, and this was followed by others, the best of which are _Le Roman\r\nd'un Jeune Homme Pauvre_, 1858; _Sibylle_, 1862; _M. de Camors_, 1867;\r\nand _Julia de Trecoeur_, 1872: the two last being perhaps his\r\nstrongest books, though the _Roman d'un Jeune Homme Pauvre_ is the most\r\npopular. M. Feuillet wrote in a pure and easy style, and exhibited in\r\nhis novels acquaintance with the manners of good society, and a\r\nconsiderable command of pathos. He was more studious of the proprieties\r\nthan most of his contemporaries, but has indulged in a somewhat\r\nunhealthy sentimentalism. Henry Murger had a very original, though a\r\nsomewhat limited, talent. He is the novelist of what is called the\r\nParisian _Boheme_, the reckless society of young artists and men of\r\nletters, which has always grouped itself in greater numbers at Paris\r\nthan anywhere else. The novel, or rather the series of sketches,\r\nentitled _La Vie de Boheme_ is one which, from the truth to nature, the\r\npathos, and the wit which accompany its caricature and burlesque of\r\nmanners, will always hold a position in literature. Murger, who\r\nexperienced many hardships in his youth, was all his life a careless and\r\nreckless liver, and died young. His works (all prose fiction, except a\r\nsmall collection of poems not very striking in form but touching and\r\nsincere in sentiment) are tolerably numerous, but the best of them are\r\nlittle more than repetitions of the _Vie de Boheme_. Edmond About, a\r\nvery lively writer, whose liveliness was not always kept sufficiently in\r\ncheck by good taste, oscillated between fiction and journalism, latterly\r\ninclining chiefly to journalism. In his younger days he was better known\r\nas a novelist, and some of his works, such as _Tolla_ and _Le Roi des\r\nMontagnes_, were very popular. More characteristic perhaps are his\r\nshorter and more familiar stories (_L'Homme a l'Oreille Cassee_, _Le Nez\r\nd'un Notaire_, etc.). In this same group of novelists of the Second\r\nRepublic and Empire ranks Ernest Feydeau, a morbid and thoroughly\r\nunwholesome author, who, however, did not lack power, and once at least\r\n(in _Sylvie_) produced work of unquestionable merit. His other novels,\r\n_Fanny_, _Daniel_, _La Comtesse de Chalis_, are chiefly remarkable as\r\nshowing the worst side of the society of the Empire. Among writers of\r\nshort stories Champfleury, a friend and contemporary of Murger (who has\r\nmore recently betaken himself to artistic criticism of the historical\r\nkind), deserves notice for his amusing extravaganzas, and Gustave Droz\r\nfor the singularly ingenious and witty series of domestic sketches\r\nentitled _Monsieur_, _Madame et Bebe_, and _Entre Nous_. The range of\r\nsubject in these is wide and not always what is understood by the\r\nEnglish word domestic. But the fancy shown in their design and the\r\nliterary skill of their execution are alike remarkable and worthy of the\r\nancient reputation of France in the short prose tale. Nor have they\r\nlacked followers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flaubert.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest of the Second Empire novelists is unquestionably Gustave\r\nFlaubert, who was born in 1821. Having a sufficient income he betook\r\nhimself early to literature, which he cultivated with an amount of care\r\nand elaborate self-discipline rare among authors. In 1848 he contributed\r\nto the _Artiste_ newspaper, then edited by Gautier, some fragments of a\r\nremarkable fantasy-piece on the legend of St. Anthony, which was not\r\npublished as a whole till nearly a quarter of a century later. In 1859,\r\nbeing then nearly forty years old, he achieved at once a great success\r\nand a great scandal by his novel of _Madame Bovary_, a study of\r\nprovincial life, as unsparing as any of Balzac's, but more true to\r\nactual nature, more finished in construction, and far superior in style.\r\nIt was the subject of a prosecution, but the author was acquitted. Next,\r\nM. Flaubert selected an archaeological subject, and produced, after long\r\nstudy, _Salammbo_, a novel the scene of which is pitched at Carthage in\r\nthe days of the mercenary war. This book, like the former, has a certain\r\nrepulsiveness of subject in parts; but the vigour of the drawing and the\r\nextraordinary skill in description are as remarkable as ever.\r\n_L'Education Sentimentale_, which followed, was Flaubert's least popular\r\nwork, being too long, and having an insufficiently defined plot and\r\ninterest. Then appeared the completed _Tentation de St. Antoine_, a book\r\ndeserving to rank at the head of its class--that of the fantastic\r\nromance. Afterwards came _Trois Contes_, exhibiting in miniature all the\r\nauthor's characteristics; and lastly, after his sudden death, in 1881,\r\nthe unfinished _Bouvard et Pecuchet_. The faults of Flaubert are, in the\r\nfirst place, indiscriminate meddling with subjects best left alone,\r\nwhich he shares with most French novelists; in the second, a certain\r\ncomplaisance in dealing with things simply horrible, which is more\r\npeculiar to him; in the third, an occasional prodigality of erudite\r\ndetail which clogs and impedes the action. His merits are an almost\r\nincomparable power of description, a mastery of those types of character\r\nwhich he attempts, an imagination of extraordinary power, and a singular\r\nsatirical criticism of life, which does not exclude the possession of a\r\nvein of romantic and almost poetical sentiment and suggestion. He is a\r\nwriter repulsive to many, unintelligible to more, and never likely to\r\nbe generally popular, but sure to retain his place in the admiration of\r\nthose who judge literature as literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Naturalists. Emile Zola.]\r\n\r\nThe name of Flaubert has been much invoked, and his reputation has been\r\nnot a little compromised, by a small but noisy school of novelists and\r\ncritics who call themselves naturalists, and affect to preach and\r\npractice a new crusade for the purpose of revolutionising poetry,\r\nfiction, and the drama. These persons, whose leader is M. Emile Zola, a\r\nbusy and popular novelist, an unsuccessful dramatist, and a critic of\r\ngreat industry, include the brothers Goncourt (one of whom is now dead)\r\nand a number of younger writers who deserve no notice, except M. Guy de\r\nMaupassant, whose prose, if too often ill employed, is as vigorous as\r\nhis verse, and who in his excellent _Pierre et Jean_ broke his\r\nnaturalist chains. The naturalists affect to derive from Stendhal,\r\nthrough Balzac and Flaubert. That is to say, they adopt the analytic\r\nmethod, and devote themselves chiefly to the study of character. But\r\nthey go farther than these great artists by objecting to the processes\r\nof art. According to them, literature is to be strictly 'scientific,' to\r\nconfine itself to anatomy, and, it would appear, to morbid anatomy only.\r\nThe Romantic treatment, that is to say, the presentation of natural\r\nfacts in an artistic setting, is rigidly proscribed. Everything must be\r\nset down on the principle of a newspaper report, or, to go to another\r\nart for an illustration, as if by a photographic camera, not by an\r\nartist's pencil. Now it will be obvious to any impartial critic that the\r\npursuance of this method is in itself fatal to the interest of a book.\r\nThe reader, unless of the very lowest order of intellect, does not want\r\nin a novel a mere reproduction of the facts of life, still less a mere\r\nscientific reference of them to causes. Accordingly, the naturalist\r\nmethod inevitably produces an extreme dulness. In their search for a\r\nremedy, its practitioners have observed that there are certain divisions\r\nof human action, usually classed as vice and crime, in which, for their\r\nown sake, and independently of pleasure in artistic appreciation of the\r\nmanner in which they are presented, a morbid interest is felt by a large\r\nnumber of persons. They therefore, with businesslike shrewdness,\r\ninvariably, or almost invariably, select their subjects from these\r\nprivileged classes. The ambition of the naturalist, briefly described\r\nwithout epigram or flippancy, but as he would himself say\r\nscientifically, is to mention the unmentionable with as much fulness of\r\ndetail as possible. In this business M. Emile Zola has not hitherto been\r\nsurpassed, though many of his pupils have run him hard. Unfortunately,\r\nfor those who are proof against the attraction of disgusting subjects\r\nmerely because they are disgusting, M. Zola is one of the dullest of\r\nwriters. His style is also very bad, possessing for its sole merits a\r\ncertain vulgar vigour which is occasionally not ineffective, and a\r\ncapacity for vivid description. He is deeply learned in _argot_, or\r\nslang, the use of which is one of the naturalist instruments, and his\r\nworks are therefore not useless as repertories of expressions to be\r\navoided. M. Zola's criticisms are more interesting than his novels,\r\nconsisting chiefly of vigorous denunciations of all the good writers of\r\nhis own day.\r\n\r\nM. Victor Cherbuliez, besides political and miscellaneous work of\r\ninferior relative power, has produced a series of novels (_Le Comte\r\nKostia_, _Le Roman d'une Honnete Femme_, _Meta Holdenis_, _Samuel Brohl\r\net Cie_) which are remarkable for style, construction, and wit. M.\r\nAlphonse Daudet, beginning early, produced in his first stage a charming\r\ncollection of _Lettres de mon Moulin_, and a pathetic autobiographic\r\nnovel _Le Petit Chose_. In his second, attempting the manner of Dickens,\r\nhe obtained with _Jack_, 1873, and _Froment Jeune et Risler Aine_, 1874,\r\ngreat popularity. His later works, _Le Nabab_, _Les Rois en Exil_, _Numa\r\nRoumestan_, _L'Evangeliste_, _L'Immortel_, shew, in their condescending\r\nto the satisfaction of vulgar curiosity as to living or lately dead\r\npersons, a great falling off. The capacity of M. Daudet (whose _Tartarin\r\nde Tarascon_ with its sequel is wholly admirable extravaganza) cannot be\r\ndoubted: his taste is deplorable. Of still more recent novelists two\r\nonly can be mentioned: M. Georges Ohnet (_Serge Panine_, _Le Maitre de\r\nForges_, _La Grande Marniere_) whose popularity with readers is only\r\nequalled by the unanimous disfavour with which all competent critics\r\nregard him, and M. Viaud ('Pierre Loti'), a naval officer, whose work\r\n(_Aziyade_, _Le Mariage de Loti_, _Mon Frere Yves_, _Madame\r\nChrysantheme_), midway between the novel, the autobiography, and the\r\ntravel-book displays some elegance and much 'preciousness' of style and\r\nfancy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Journalists and Critics.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paul de Saint-Victor.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hippolyte Taine.]\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution the fortune of journalism was assured, and though\r\nunder the subsequent forms of government it was subjected to a rigid\r\ncensorship, it was too firmly established to be overthrown. Almost all\r\nmen of letters flocked to it. The leading article or unsigned political\r\nand miscellaneous essay has never been so strong a feature of French\r\njournalism as it has been of English. On the other hand, the\r\n_feuilleton_, or daily, weekly, and monthly instalment of fiction or\r\ncriticism, has been one of its chief characteristics. Many, if not most,\r\nof the most celebrated novels of the last half century have originally\r\nappeared in this form, publication in independent parts, which was long\r\nfashionable in England, never having found favour in France. In the same\r\nway, though weekly reviews devoted wholly or mainly to literary\r\ncriticism have, for some reason, never been successful with the French\r\nas they have with us, daily journalism has given a greater space to\r\ncriticism, and especially to theatrical criticism. All French criticism\r\nsubsequent to 1830 may be said to derive, whether it deals with\r\nliterature, with the theatre, or with art, from three masters,\r\nSainte-Beuve, Gautier, and Janin. The method of the first has been\r\nsufficiently explained. Gautier's was rather the expression of a fine\r\ncritical appreciation in the most exquisite style, and Janin's, the far\r\neasier, and, after a short time, unimportant plan of gossiping amiably\r\nand amusingly about, it might be the subject, it might be something\r\nquite different. The only successor to Gautier was Paul de Saint-Victor,\r\nwho, however, was inferior to his master in appreciative power, and\r\nexaggerated his habit of relying on style to carry him through. Paul de\r\nSaint-Victor was not a frequent writer, and his collected works as yet\r\ndo not fill many volumes. _Hommes et Dieux_, which is perhaps the\r\nprincipal of them, exhibits a deficiency of catholicity in literary\r\nappreciation. His latest book, _Les Deux Masques_, an unfinished study\r\nof the history of the stage, contains much brilliant writing, but is\r\nwanting in solid qualities. As a theatrical critic, Janin was succeeded\r\nby a curiously different person, M. Francisque Sarcey, who has chiefly\r\nbeen noteworthy for severity and a kind of pedagogic common sense, as\r\nunlike as possible to the good-humoured gossip of Janin. M. de\r\nPontmartin was an acrid but vigorous critic on the royalist and orthodox\r\nside. M. Hippolyte Taine, chief of Sainte-Beuve's followers, has\r\nsomewhat caricatured his master's method. Sainte-Beuve's principle was,\r\nit must be remembered, to examine carefully the circumstances of his\r\nauthor's time, in order to ascertain their bearing upon him. In M.\r\nTaine's hands this wise practice changed itself into a theory--the\r\ntheory that every man is a kind of product of the circumstances, and\r\nthat, by examining the latter, the man is necessarily explained. M.\r\nTaine chose for his principal exercising ground the history of English\r\nliterature. He produced under that title a series of studies often\r\nacute, always brilliant in style, but constantly showing the faults of\r\nthe critical method just indicated. Of other literary critics, the two\r\nchief besides M. Taine are M. Edmond Scherer and M. Emile Montegut. The\r\nlatter is a critic of a very fine and delicate appreciation. A short\r\nessay of his on Boccaccio may be specified as one of the best of French\r\ncontemporary critical exercises. M. Scherer has a good deal of common\r\nsense, a considerable acquaintance with literature, and a clear,\r\nstraightforward, and vigorous style. His judgment, however, is much\r\nlimited by prejudice, and some of his studies, such as those on\r\nBaudelaire and Diderot, show that he is an untrustworthy judge of what\r\nis not commonplace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Academic Critics.]\r\n\r\nA separate school of criticism, of a more academic character than that\r\nrepresented by most of the names just mentioned, has existed in France\r\nduring the greater part of the century, and during a great part of it\r\nhas found its means of utterance partly in the University chairs and in\r\ntreatises crowned by the Academy, partly in a well-known fortnightly\r\nperiodical, the _Revue des Deux-Mondes_. The master of this school of\r\ncriticism may be said to have been Villemain, 1790-1870, who represents\r\nthe classical tradition corrected by a very considerable study of other\r\nEuropean languages besides French. Not the least part of the narrowness\r\nof the older classical school was due to its ignorance of these\r\nlanguages, and its consequent incapacity to make the necessary\r\ncomparisons. Villemain's criticism, though not quite so flexible as it\r\nmight have been, was on the whole sound, and the same variety of the\r\nart, though with more limitations, was represented by Guizot. Not a few\r\ncritics of merit of the same kind were born at the close of the last\r\ncentury, or at the beginning of this. Among them may be mentioned M.\r\nNisard, a bitter opponent of the Romantic movement, and a prejudiced\r\ncritic of French literature, but a writer of very considerable\r\nknowledge, and of some literary merit; Eugene Geruzez, author of by far\r\nthe best history of French literature in a small compass, and of many\r\nseparate treatises of value; Alexandre Vinet, a Swiss, and a Protestant,\r\nwho died at no very advanced age, leaving much work of merit; and\r\nSaint-Marc Girardin, who busied himself nearly as much in journalism and\r\npolitics as in literary criticism proper, but whose professorial _Cours\r\nde Litterature Dramatique_ is a work of interest, exhibiting a kind of\r\ntransition style between the older and newer criticism. Michelet,\r\nQuinet, M. Renan, and others, who will be mentioned under other heads,\r\nhave also been considerable as critics. Philarete Chasles was a lively\r\nwriter, who devoted himself especially to English literature, and whose\r\njudgment in matters literary was not quite equal to his affection for\r\nthem. The critics of the _Revue des Deux-Mondes_ proper include, besides\r\nnot a few authors named elsewhere, Gustave Planche, a person of curious\r\nidiosyncrasy, chiefly remarkable for the ferocity of his critiques;\r\nSaint Rene Taillandier, a dull man of industry; and M. Caro, a man of\r\nindustry who was not dull. Latterly some younger writers have\r\nendeavoured (chiefly in its pages) to set up a kind of neo-classical\r\nschool, which is equally opposed to modern innovations, and to the habit\r\nof studying old French, that is, French before the sixteenth century.\r\nThe chief of these advocates of a return to the Malherbe-Boileau dungeon\r\nis M. Ferdinand Brunetiere. We must not omit among the older generation\r\nM. Lenient, the author of two admirable volumes on the History of French\r\nSatire; among the younger, M. Paul Stapfer, the author of an excellent\r\nstudy of 'Shakespeare et l'Antiquite,' M. Jules Lemaitre, a brilliant\r\ncritic, who is perhaps a little more brilliant than critical, and M.\r\nEmile Faguet, whose criticism is as sound as it is accomplished.\r\n\r\nAmong the representatives of art criticism Viollet-le-Duc as a writer\r\non architecture, and Charles Blanc (brother of Louis) as an authority on\r\ndecorative art generally, made before their deaths reputations\r\nsufficiently exceptional to be noticed here. Here also, as\r\nrepresentatives of other classes of literature, the names of Hector\r\nBerlioz, the great composer, author of letters and memoirs of great\r\ninterest; of Henri Monnier, an artist not much less skilful with his pen\r\nthan with his pencil in satirical sketches of Parisian types (especially\r\nhis famous 'Joseph Prudhomme'); of Charles Monselet, a miscellaneous\r\nwriter whose sympathies were as wide and his temper as genial as his\r\nliterary faculty was accomplished; of X. Doudan, whose posthumous\r\nremains and letters attracted much attention after a life of silence;\r\nand of the Genevese diarist Amiel, selections from whose vast journal of\r\nphilosophical sentimentalism and miscellaneous reflection have also been\r\npopular, may be cited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Linguistic and Literary Study of French.]\r\n\r\nThe revived study of old French literature just noticed is the only\r\ndepartment of the literature of erudition which can receive notice here,\r\nfor prose science and classical study fall equally out of our range of\r\npossible treatment here. The _Histoire Litteraire_ was revived, and has\r\nbeen steadily proceeded with. Every department of old French literature\r\nhas been studied, latterly in vigorous rivalry with the Germans. The\r\nmost important single name in this study has been that of the late M.\r\nPaulin Paris, who edited reprints of all sorts with untiring energy, and\r\nin a thoroughly literary spirit. The Chansons de Gestes have been the\r\nespecial care of M. Paulin Paris, his son M. Gaston Paris (_Histoire\r\nPoetique de Charlemagne_), and M. Leon Gautier, who has written, and is\r\nnow republishing in an altered and improved form, a great work on the\r\nearly French epics. The Arthurian romances have been more studied in\r\nGermany and Belgium than in France, though valuable work has been done\r\nin them by M. Paulin Paris, M. Hucher, and others. The Fabliaux have\r\nrecently appeared in a nearly complete edition, by M. de Montaiglon. M.\r\nP. Meyer has thrown new light on the _Roman d'Alixandre_. The _Roman du\r\nRenart_, also published by Meon, has been undertaken again by M. Ernest\r\nMartin. The separate authors of the later ages have, in almost every\r\ncase, been the subject of much careful work, and for some years past a\r\n'Societe des Anciens Textes Francais' has existed for the express\r\npurpose of publishing unprinted MSS. This society has undertaken the\r\ngreat collection of _Miracles de Notre Dame_, the works of Eustache\r\nDeschamps, and other important tasks. A great deal of excellent work in\r\nthe same direction has been done in Belgium by members of the various\r\nAcademies. The great classics of France, from the sixteenth century\r\nonward, have been the object of constant and careful editing, such as\r\nthe classics of no other country have enjoyed. Nor has the linguistic\r\npart of the study been omitted. The two chief monuments of this are the\r\ngreat dictionary of Littre, and the complement of it, now in course of\r\npublication, by M. Godefroy, which contains a complete lexicon of the\r\nolder tongue. Among the collections of old French literature, the\r\nBibliotheque Elzevirienne may be especially noticed. This, besides many\r\nreprints of isolated authors, contains invaluable examples of the early\r\ntheatre, a still more precious collection of scattered poems of the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and one of miscellanies of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth. Under the Empire the government began the\r\npublication of all the Chansons de Gestes, but the enterprise was\r\nunfortunately interrupted at the tenth volume.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philosophical Writers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comte.]\r\n\r\nThe branches of literature, other than the Belles Lettres, which\r\nnaturally retain, longer than those which busy themselves with science\r\nas it is now understood, the literary interest, are philosophy,\r\ntheology, and history. In philosophy France has produced, during the\r\npresent century, only one name of the first importance. As has been the\r\ncase with all other European nations, her philosophical energies have\r\nchiefly been devoted to the historical side of philosophy, a tendency\r\nspecially encouraged by the already-mentioned influence of Cousin.\r\nDamiron, the chief authority in French on the materialist schools of the\r\neighteenth century; M. Jules Simon and Vacherot, who busied themselves\r\nchiefly with the Alexandrian philosophers--Cousin it should be\r\nremembered was the editor of Proclus--and Charles de Remusat, a man of\r\ngreat capacity, who, among other rather unexpected literary\r\noccupations, devoted himself to Abelard, Thomas a Becket, and other\r\nrepresentatives of scholasticism, illustrate this tendency. The\r\nphilosophy of the middle ages was also the subject of one of the\r\nclearest and best-written of philosophical studies, the _De la\r\nPhilosophie Scolastique_ of B. Haureau. The name, however, of the\r\ncentury in French philosophical literature is that of Auguste Comte, the\r\nfounder of what is called Positivism. He was born at Montpelier three or\r\nfour years before the end of the last century, and died at Paris in\r\nSeptember, 1857. Comte passed through the discipline of initiation in\r\nthe Saint Simonian views--Saint Simon was a descendant of the great\r\nwriter of that name, who developed a curious form of communism very\r\ninteresting politically, but important to literature only from the\r\nremarkable influence it had upon his contemporaries--but, like most of\r\nSaint Simon's disciples, soon emancipated himself. To discuss Comte's\r\nphilosophical views would be impossible here. It is sufficient to say\r\nthat the cardinal principle of his earlier work, the _Cours de\r\nPhilosophie Positive_, is that the world of thought has passed through\r\nsuccessively a theological stage and a metaphysical stage, and is now\r\nreduced to the observation and classification of phenomena and their\r\nrelations. On the basis cleared by this sweeping hypothesis, Comte, in\r\nhis later days (under the inspiration of a lady, Madame Clotilde de\r\nVaux, if he himself be believed), developed a remarkable construction of\r\npositive religion. This was indignantly rejected by his most acute\r\nfollowers, the chief of whom was the philologist and critic Littre.\r\nOutside of Comtism, France has not produced many writers on philosophy,\r\nexcept philosophical historians. M. Taine, in his _De l'Intelligence_,\r\nturned his acute intellect and ready pen in this direction for a moment,\r\nbut not with much success. Perhaps from the literary view the most\r\nimportant philosophical writer in French for the last half century is M.\r\nRenan, who will find his place more appropriately in the next paragraph.\r\nBetween Saint Simon and Comte, if space allowed, notice would have to be\r\ntaken of many political writers of the middle of the century, whose\r\nvisionary and for the most part communistic views had a considerable but\r\npassing influence, such as Cabet, Fourier, Pierre Leroux, and the\r\nviolent and not wholly sane but vigorous Proudhon. Here, however,\r\nnothing but bare mention, and that only for completeness' sake, can be\r\ngiven to them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theological Writers. Montalembert.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ozanam.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lacordaire.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ernest Renan.]\r\n\r\nIn theology, as represented in literature, the dominant interest of the\r\nperiod belongs at first to the continuators of the Liberal-Catholic\r\nschool of Lamennais. The greatest of these, beyond all question, was\r\nCharles Forbes de Montalembert, whose mother was a Scotchwoman, and his\r\nfather French ambassador in Sweden. He was born in April, 1810, and died\r\non the 13th of March, 1870. Montalembert was young enough to come under\r\nthe influence of Lamennais only indirectly, and at the extreme end of\r\nthat writer's orthodox period. His immediate master was rather the\r\neloquent Abbe Lacordaire. His father was a peer of France, and\r\nMontalembert succeeded early to his position, which gave him an\r\nopportunity of supporting the great contention of the Liberal Catholics\r\nunder Louis Philippe, the right to establish schools for themselves.\r\nBeing devoted first of all to the defence of ecclesiastical interests by\r\nevery legitimate means, and having no anti-Republican prejudices,\r\nMontalembert was able to accept the second Revolution, though not the\r\nSecond Empire, and he continued to be one of the most moderate, but\r\ndangerous, opponents of the government of Napoleon III. His chief works,\r\nwhich have much brilliancy and vigour, are his 'Life of Elizabeth of\r\nHungary,' his 'Life and Times of St. Anselm,' his _Avenir Politique de\r\nl'Angleterre_, and, most of all, his great work on 'The Monks of the\r\nWest from St. Benedict to St. Bernard.' A fellow worker with\r\nMontalembert, though earlier cut off, was Frederic Ozanam, a brilliant\r\nstudent and lecturer in mediaeval history, who was the chief literary\r\ncritic of the Neo-Catholic movement during the later years of Louis\r\nPhilippe's reign. Ozanam's chief work was his study on Dante. About this\r\ntime a considerable resurrection of pulpit eloquence took place. Its\r\nchief representative was the already-mentioned Jean Baptiste Henri\r\nLacordaire, who was born in 1802, and died in 1861. Lacordaire was a\r\npartner of Lamennais in the _Avenir_. But, unlike his master, he took\r\nthe papal reproof obediently, and continued to preach in the orthodox\r\nsense. He entered the order of St. Dominic in 1840, but was nevertheless\r\nelected to the Assembly, in 1848, as a compliment, doubtless, to the\r\nfervent radicalism he had displayed earlier. Lacordaire's literary\r\nreputation is almost entirely confined to his sermons, the most famous\r\nof which were preached at Notre Dame. Other celebrated preachers of the\r\nmiddle of the century were, on the Catholic side, the Pere Felix, and on\r\nthe Protestant, Athanase Coquerel. Of the extreme orthodox party, during\r\nthe Second Empire, the chief names from the point of view of literature\r\nwere those of Monseigneur Dupanloup, bishop of Orleans, and the\r\njournalist, Louis Veuillot. The former, one of the most eloquent and one\r\nof the ablest men of his time in France, began with a certain\r\nliberalism, but gradually hardened into extremer views, distinguishing\r\nhimself in his place in the Academy by violent opposition to the\r\nadmission of M. Littre, as a positivist. The latter, as editor of the\r\njournal _L'Univers_, brought remarkable wit and a faculty of slashing\r\ncriticism, not often equalled, to the service of his party, indulging,\r\nhowever, too often in mere scurrility. From this same literary point of\r\nview, the chief name in the theological literature of this period is\r\nonce more on the unorthodox side. Since the days of Joseph de Maistre\r\nthe church had far more than held her own in the literary arena; but the\r\ndiscouragement given at Rome to the followers of Lamennais seemed to\r\nbring ill luck with it. Ernest Renan, who, with some faults, is one of\r\nthe most remarkable masters of French style in our time, was born in\r\n1823, at Treguier in Britanny. He was intended for the priesthood, and\r\nwas educated for the most part at clerical seminaries. On arriving,\r\nhowever, at manhood, he did not feel inclined to take orders; accepted\r\nthe place of usher at a school, and soon distinguished himself by\r\nlinguistic studies, especially on the Semitic languages. He also\r\nexercised himself a good deal in literary criticism and as a journalist\r\nof all work on the staffs of the _Journal des Debats_ and the _Revue des\r\nDeux-Mondes_. His first really remarkable work, published in 1850, is\r\n_Averroes et l'Averroisme_, a book injured by the author's want of\r\nsympathy with the thought of the middle ages, but full of research and\r\nof reflection. This gained him a post in the Paris Library. He then\r\nproduced several works, dealing more or less with the Hebrew Scriptures.\r\nIn 1860 he had a government mission to Phoenicia and Palestine, which\r\nenabled him to examine the Holy Land very attentively. On his return he\r\nwas appointed to the chair of Hebrew at the College de France, but the\r\noutcry against his unorthodoxy was so great that he was suspended. He\r\nbegan about this time to publish his famous series of _Origines du\r\nChristianisme_ with, for a first volume, a _Vie de Jesus_, imbued with a\r\ncurious kind of eclectic and romantic rationalism. This has been\r\nfollowed by numerous volumes dealing with the early ages of\r\nChristianity. In 1870 he made himself conspicuous by a letter to Strauss\r\non the subject of the Franco-German War. After the catastrophe he\r\nconfined himself for a time to literary and philosophical studies.\r\nRecently, however, besides working at his _Origines_, which are now\r\ncompleted, he has produced some half-political, half-fanciful studies of\r\ngreat literary excellence, such as _Caliban_, a satire on democracy, and\r\n_La Fontaine de Jouvence_, a brilliant mediaeval fantasy-piece, covering\r\na violent attack on Germany. M. Renan is, in point of style, perhaps the\r\nmost considerable prose writer of France now living who is a prose\r\nwriter only. His prejudices are strong, and his strictly argumentative\r\nand logical faculty rather weak. In temperament he is what may be called\r\na sentimental rationalist. But his literary knowledge is extraordinarily\r\nwide and very accurate, while his literary sympathies, though somewhat\r\nirregular in their operation, are warm. These peculiarities reflect\r\nthemselves in his style, which is a direct descendant of that of\r\nRousseau through M. Renan's own countryman, Chateaubriand. As a\r\ndescriber of scenery he is unmatched among his contemporaries. He has an\r\nextraordinary power of vivid and interesting narration inclining\r\nsomewhat to the over-picturesque. No one is able more cleverly to seize\r\non the most striking and telling features of a landscape, a book, a\r\ncharacter, and, by adroit dwelling on these, to present the whole as\r\nvividly as possible to his readers. No one again is more thoroughly\r\nmaster of a certain rather vague but telling eloquence which deals\r\nchiefly with the moral feelings and the domestic affections, and\r\nexercises an amiably softening influence on those who submit themselves\r\nto it. M. Renan in style is rather an orator than a writer, though the\r\nextreme care and finish which he bestows on his work give him a high\r\nplace in literature proper.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historians. Thierry.]\r\n\r\nIn history a group of distinguished names, besides a still larger number\r\nof names only less individually distinguished, deserve notice. First\r\namong these, in order of time, may be mentioned the two brothers Amedee\r\nand Augustin Thierry, the former of whom was born in 1787, and died in\r\n1873, while the latter, born in 1795, died in 1856. Both devoted\r\nthemselves to historical studies. But, while Amedee employed himself\r\nalmost wholly on the history of Gaul during Roman times and on Roman\r\nhistory, Augustin, who was by far the more gifted of the two, took a\r\nwider range. He was born and educated at Blois, and for some time\r\ndevoted himself to politics and sociology, being a disciple of Saint\r\nSimon, and a fellow-worker of Comte. He soon, however, betook himself to\r\nhistory, and in 1825 published his 'History of the Norman Conquest in\r\nEngland.' Blindness followed, but he was able to continue his work. In\r\n1835 he published _Dix Ans d'Etudes Historiques_, and in 1840, what is\r\nperhaps his best work, _Recits des Temps Merovingiens_, a book which has\r\nfew rivals as exhibiting in a fascinating light, but without any\r\nsacrifice of historical accuracy to mere picturesqueness, the\r\ncircumstances and events of an unfamiliar time. His last work of\r\nimportance was an essay on the Tiers Etat and its origin. Thierry is an\r\nexcellent example of an historian handling, with little guidance from\r\npredecessors, a difficult and neglected but important age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thiers.]\r\n\r\nFar less important as a historian, but distinguished by his double\r\ncharacter of statesman and _litterateur_, in which he was more fortunate\r\nthan his two rivals in the same double career, Guizot and Lamartine, was\r\nLouis Adolphe Thiers, who was born at Marseilles, of the lower middle\r\nclass, in 1797. He was brought up for the law, being educated at\r\nMarseilles and at Aix. Then he went to Paris, and after a short time\r\nobtained work on the _Constitutionnel_ as supporter of the liberal\r\nopposition during the Restoration. His _Histoire de la Revolution\r\nFrancaise_ appeared between 1823-1827, and brought him much reputation,\r\nwhich was very ill deserved as far as fulness and accuracy of\r\ninformation are concerned. French readers, however, have ever been\r\nindifferent to mere accuracy, and are given to admire even a superficial\r\nappearance of order and clearness; at any rate, the book, added to his\r\nconsiderable reputation as a political writer, made him famous. A paper,\r\nwhich he founded in the beginning of 1830, the _National_, had much\r\nshare in bringing about the Revolution of that year. After it Thiers was\r\nelected to the Chamber of Deputies for Aix, and in a short time became a\r\nrenowned debater. He held office again and again under Louis Philippe,\r\nand was believed to be in favour of a warlike policy. When he retired\r\nfrom office he began his principal literary work (a continuation of his\r\nfirst), 'The History of the Consulate and the Empire.' He took no part\r\nin the Revolution of 1848, and accepted the Republic, but was banished\r\nat the _coup d'etat_, though not for long. In 1863 he re-entered the\r\nChamber, having constantly worked at his History, which tended not a\r\nlittle to reconstruct the Napoleonic legend. Yet he was a steady though\r\na moderate opponent of the Second Empire. On its downfall, Thiers, as\r\nthe most distinguished statesman the country possessed, undertook the\r\nnegotiations with the enemy--a difficult task, which he performed with\r\nextreme ability. He then became President of the Republic, which post he\r\nheld till 1873. He died on the 3rd of September, 1877. The chief fault\r\nof Thiers as a historian is his misleading partiality, which is\r\nespecially displayed in his account of Napoleon's wars, and reaches its\r\nclimax in that of the battle of Waterloo. He has, however, great merits\r\nin lucidity of arrangement, in an eloquent, if rather declamatory style,\r\nand in a faculty of conveying a considerable amount of information\r\nwithout breaking the march of his narrative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guizot]\r\n\r\nBy a curious coincidence, the chief rival of Thiers in politics (at\r\nleast during the greater part of his life) was of his own class and\r\ncondition, and, like him, primarily a man of letters. Francois Pierre\r\nGuillaume Guizot was, however, ten years the senior of Thiers, having\r\nbeen born in 1787, at Nimes. Guizot was a Protestant, and his father\r\nperished in the Terror. He was educated at Geneva, but went to Paris\r\nearly, and produced in 1809 (being then only twenty-two) a dictionary of\r\nsynonyms. After this he did miscellaneous literary work of various\r\nkinds, and at the Restoration filled, as a moderate Royalist, various\r\nposts under government, being appointed, among other things, to a\r\nhistory professorship at the Sorbonne. He became more and more liberal,\r\nand in 1824 his lectures were forbidden. His literary activity, was,\r\nhowever, incessant, his greatest work being a collection of early French\r\nhistorical writings in thirty-one volumes. He also paid much attention\r\nto the history of England, and published, in 1826, a _Histoire de la\r\nRevolution d'Angleterre_. This was followed by many other works, of\r\nwhich his 'History of Civilisation in Europe,' and 'History of\r\nCivilisation in France,' are the best known. He had been elected a\r\nmember of the Chamber before the Revolution of 1830, and after it he was\r\nappointed minister of Public Instruction, having the powerful support of\r\nthe Broglie family. He was afterwards ambassador to London, and then\r\nPrime Minister, being, it is said, very much to blame for the Revolution\r\nof February. He escaped to London with some difficulty, and, though he\r\nrevisited France, had to return to England at the advent of Louis\r\nNapoleon. He was not, however, a permanent exile, but was allowed to\r\nenjoy his estate at Val Richer in Normandy. He died in 1874, having been\r\nincessantly occupied on literary work of all kinds (chiefly connected\r\nwith French and English history) for the last half century of his life.\r\nThe chief of these in bulk was a voluminous history of France not\r\ncompleted till after his death. Guizot's enormous fertility (for not a\r\ntwentieth of his works has been mentioned) perhaps injuriously affected\r\nhis style, which is not remarkable. Sound common sense and laborious\r\nacquaintance with facts are his chief characteristics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mignet.]\r\n\r\nA companion of Thiers at college, and a _protege_ of his during his\r\nyears of power, was Francois Mignet. Born a year before his friend, he\r\noutlived him. Mignet, too, wrote, and at the same time as Thiers, a\r\nHistory of the French Revolution of curiously different character. He\r\nbecame secretary of the Institute, and in 1837 a member of the Academy.\r\nHis chief later works were on the 'Spanish Succession,' on Mary Stuart,\r\nand on Charles the Fifth after his abdication, with, last of all, the\r\nrivalry of Charles V. and Francis I. Mignet is as trustworthy as Thiers\r\nis the reverse. But his historical manner is exceedingly dry, as also is\r\nhis style, though it is correct and not inelegant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Michelet.]\r\n\r\nA very different writer was Jules Michelet, the most original and\r\nremarkable historian in point of style that France has ever produced.\r\nBorn at Paris, in 1798, he was also educated there, and became a\r\nschoolmaster. Soon after he came of age he was transferred to the Ecole\r\nNormale. The Revolution of 1830, owing to the influence of Cousin and\r\nGuizot, opened great opportunities for historical students, and Michelet\r\nwas enabled to publish not a few historical treatises, some of a rather\r\nspecialist nature, others popular abstracts of French history. In 1838\r\nhe was appointed to a chair in the College de France, and, in\r\nconjunction with his friend Quinet, he took part in the violent polemic\r\nagainst the Jesuits which distinguished the time. He had already for\r\nsome years begun his strange and splendid _Histoire de France_,\r\n1833-1867, but he accompanied its progress with a crowd of little books\r\nof a controversial and miscellaneous character. Shortly before the\r\nRevolution of 1848 he began, and soon after the _coup d'etat_ finished,\r\nhis _Histoire de la Revolution_. He declined to take the oaths to the\r\nEmpire, and so lost the place in the Record Office which he then held.\r\nHe died in 1874, and, notwithstanding his incessant literary activity\r\nduring his life, various unpublished works have appeared since, one of\r\nwhich, describing the hunger-pinched population of the Riviera, is a\r\nmasterpiece of his volcanic style. This style is characteristic not only\r\nof his great history, but also of his smaller books, of which _Des\r\nJesuites_, _Du Pretre_, _Du Peuple_, _L'Oiseau_, _L'Insecte_, _L'Amour_,\r\n_La Sorciere_ (the last perhaps the most remarkable of all), are\r\nespecially noteworthy. It is entirely unlike the style of any previous\r\nFrench writer, except that of Lamennais, who was, however, rather\r\nMichelet's contemporary than his predecessor, and that of Victor Hugo,\r\nin some of his more recent work. Broken and irregular in construction,\r\nit is extraordinarily vivid in colour, and striking in the outline of\r\nits presentment. The _History of France_ is a book to which little\r\njustice can be done in the space here available. It is strongly\r\nprejudiced by Michelet's republican and anti-Catholic views, and, like\r\nall picturesque histories, it brings into undue relief incidents and\r\npersonages which have happened to strike the author's imagination. But\r\nit is extraordinarily stimulating, full of energy and life, and almost\r\nunequalled in the power with which the writer restores and revives the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quinet.]\r\n\r\nA bosom friend of Michelet, and his compeer in the attack on the\r\nJesuits, was Edgar Quinet, who was born near Bourg in 1803, and died in\r\n1875. He was brought up for the most part at his country home in a\r\nretired situation, where he early showed not only great devotion to\r\nliterature, but a curious tendency towards philosophic mysticism. He\r\ntravelled in Germany when young, and his translation of Herder's\r\n_Philosophie der Geschichte_ introduced him to Cousin, and gave him some\r\nprofit and much reputation. He was sent to Greece on a government\r\nmission, and after a time received a professorship, first at Lyons, and\r\nthen at Paris, though his republicanism did not recommend him. He was an\r\nactive supporter of the Revolution of February, and a consistent\r\nopponent of the Empire, during which he remained in exile. Quinet's\r\nworks, both in poetry and prose, are numerous. The chief are a great\r\nprose poem, or dramatic allegory, called _Ahasuerus_, 1834, a work on\r\nthe early French epics (insufficiently informed, but appreciative and\r\nenthusiastic), _Le Genie des Religions_, 1843 (a series of discourses\r\nfull of the widest and vaguest generalisation, but stimulating and\r\ngenerous), _Les Revolutions d'Italie_, _Merlin l'Enchanteur_, 1861\r\n(another curious book something after the fashion of _Ahasuerus_), a\r\nnondescript miscellany on history and science entitled _La Creation_,\r\n1869, and _La Revolution_, 1865. His poems (in verse) are _Promethee_,\r\n_Napoleon_, _Les Esclaves_, of which the first and last are dramatic in\r\nform. His style and thought were strongly tinged with mysticism, and\r\nwith a singular undogmatic pietism, as well as with strong but\r\nspeculative republicanism in politics. He is thus not a historian to\r\nconsult for facts (though his knowledge both of history and literature\r\nwas accurate and wide), but an inspiriting generaliser on the philosophy\r\nof history. Both in Michelet and in Quinet there is an affectation of\r\nthe seer, as well as an undue fluency of language, and an absence of\r\nprecision in form and place, which detract from their otherwise high\r\nliterary value. The collected works of the first exceed fifty volumes,\r\nthose of the second fill nearly thirty; and much of this vast total is\r\nephemeral in interest and unchastened in form. Although neither was a\r\njournalist, both exhibit the defects of a period of journalism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tocqueville.]\r\n\r\nThe last of the greater names calling for mention is that of Alexis de\r\nTocqueville, who was born, of a noble Norman family, at Verneuil, in\r\n1805. Tocqueville was educated for the bar, and called to it after the\r\nRestoration. But after the revolution of July he exchanged his\r\nappointment in the magistracy for a travelling mission to America, to\r\nexamine the prisons and penitentiaries of the United States. He,\r\nhowever, studied something else than prisons, and, in 1835, published\r\nhis famous work on 'Democracy in America.' He married an Englishwoman,\r\nand soon afterwards entered the Chamber. During the Republic he occupied\r\npositions of some importance. The Empire dismissed him from public life,\r\nbut gave him the opportunity of writing his second great book on the\r\n_Ancien Regime_. His health was, however, weak, and he died, in 1859, of\r\nconsumption. The characteristics of Tocqueville as a historian (or\r\nrather as a philosophic essayist on history) are great purity and\r\nclearness of style, unusual logical power, and an entire absence of\r\nprepossession. He is one of the few historians who have treated\r\ndemocracy without either enthusiastic love for it on the one hand, or\r\nfanatical dislike and fear of it on the other; and his two books are,\r\nand are likely to remain, classics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Historians.]\r\n\r\nA very rapid survey must suffice for the remainder of the names in this\r\ndivision. A. de Barante, among numerous other works of merit, is best\r\nknown by a careful and detailed history of the Dukes of Burgundy; J. A.\r\nBuchon, Petitot, J. A. Michaud, and J. Poujoulat, produced invaluable\r\ncollections of the chronicles and memoirs in which France is so rich. J.\r\nJ. Ampere occupied himself chiefly with Roman history, and with the\r\nhistory of France and French literature in the Gallo-Roman time. A.\r\nBeugnot, besides other work, arranged a precious collection of feudal\r\nlaw. Emile de Bonnechose wrote a good short history of France. Louis\r\nBlanc (an important actor in the Revolution of 1848) produced an\r\nelaborate and well-written history of the Revolution from the moderate\r\nrepublican side, and afterwards reprinted from newspapers some curious\r\nletters from England during his exile here. In opposition chiefly to\r\nThiers, P. Lanfrey, in a laborious history of Napoleon, entirely\r\noverthrew the Napoleonic legend, and damaged, it would seem irreparably,\r\nthe character of its hero. Philippe de Segur gave a history of the\r\nRussian campaign of Napoleon. Mortimer-Ternaux accomplished a valuable\r\nhistory of the Terror. M. Henri Martin was the author of the only recent\r\nhistory of France on a scale which challenges comparison with Michelet.\r\nIt has no extraordinary literary merit, and its author was something of\r\na partisan. But it is full, sober, and fairly accurate. In recent days\r\nM. Taine, deserting literary and philosophical criticism for history,\r\nexecuted a new and remarkable history of the Revolution, which, by once\r\nmore putting its horrors in a clear and fair light, very much irritated\r\nthe partisans of the 'ideas of 89.' The Duke d'Aumale has made something\r\nmore than a mere addition to the works of 'Royal and Noble Authors,' in\r\nhis History of the Princes of Conde. The Duke de Broglie, a politician,\r\nupon whom the political changes of France enforced political retirement,\r\nhas produced a series of historical works on the 18th century and has\r\nedited the interesting memoirs of his father, the patron of Guizot. Of\r\nother recent memoirs by far the most remarkable, whether as literature\r\nor history, are those of Madame de Remusat, mother of Charles de\r\nRemusat, who died early in the Restoration period, but whose memoirs and\r\nletters, not published till after her son's death (but already referred\r\nto here), have given her a posthumous reputation hardly inferior to that\r\nof any of the literary ladies before her and not likely soon to wane.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[292] Merimee's work is not absolutely despicable in bulk, for it\r\nextends to some eighteen volumes pretty closely packed. But much of\r\nthese is occupied with familiar letters, and much more with merely\r\nmiscellaneous writing. His finished and definitely literary publications\r\ndo not amount to a third of the whole.\r\n\r\n[293] In this notice of the acting drama of France, with which, as\r\ncontrasted with the literary theatre, the present writer has\r\ncomparatively little acquaintance, he is considerably indebted to Mr.\r\nBrander Matthews' useful _French Dramatists of the Nineteenth Century_.\r\nLondon and New York; 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the five books of this _History_ the reader has, it is believed,\r\nbefore him a sufficient though necessarily brief description of the\r\nvarious men and works whereof knowledge is desirable to enable him to\r\nperceive the main outlines of the course of French literature. In the\r\ninterchapters some attempt has been made to sum up the general phenomena\r\nof that literature as distinguished from its particular accomplishments\r\nduring the chief periods of its development. Beyond this neither the\r\nscale of the book, nor its plan as indicated in the preface, has\r\npermitted of indulgence in generalising criticism. But it has been\r\nsuggested by authorities whose competence is not disputable that\r\nsomething in the nature of a summary of these summaries, pointing out\r\nbriefly the general history, accomplishments, and peculiarities of the\r\nFrench tongue in its literary aspect during the ten centuries of its\r\nexistence, is required, if only for the sake of a symmetrical\r\nconclusion. It may be urged on the other side that the history of\r\nliterature--like all other histories, and perhaps more than all other\r\nhistories--is never really complete, and that there is consequently some\r\ndanger in attempting at any given time to treat it as finished. He must\r\nhave been a miraculously acute critic who, if he had attempted such\r\ntreatment of the present subject sixty or seventy years ago, would not\r\nhave found his results ludicrously falsified by the event but few years\r\nafterwards. But this drawback only applies to generalisation of the\r\npseudo-scientific kind which attempts to predict: it can be easily\r\nguarded against by attending to the strict duties of the historian and,\r\nwithout attempting to speak of the future, dealing only with the\r\nactually accomplished past.\r\n\r\nThe first thing, and perhaps the most important thing, which must strike\r\nanyone who looks upon French literature as a whole, is that, taking all\r\nconditions together, it is the most complete example of a regularly and\r\nindependently developed national literature that presents itself\r\nanywhere. It is no doubt inferior in the point of independence to Greek,\r\nbut then it has a much longer course, considered as the exponent of\r\nnational character. It has a shorter course than English, and it is not\r\nmore generally expository of national characteristics; but then it is\r\nfor a great part of that course infinitely more independent of foreign\r\ninfluences, and, unlike English, it has scarcely any breaks or dead\r\nseasons in its record. Compared with Latin (which as a literature may be\r\nsaid to be entirely modelled on Greek) it is exceptionally original:\r\ncompared with Spanish and Italian it has been exceptionally long-lived\r\nand hale in its life: compared with German it was exceptionally early in\r\nattaining the full possession of its faculties. Just as (putting aside\r\nminor and somewhat pedantic considerations) no country in Europe has so\r\nlong and so independently developed a political history, so in none has\r\nliterary history developed itself more independently and for a longer\r\nspace of continuous time. No foreign invasion sensibly affects the\r\nFrench tongue; no foreign influence sensibly alters the course of French\r\nliterature. It has been shown at intervals during this history how\r\nlittle direct influence classical models had on the original forms of\r\nliterature in France, how completely German and Celtic contributions of\r\nsubject were assimilated, how the Provencal examples of form were rather\r\nindependently followed than literally or slavishly adopted. The dawn or\r\nrather the twilight of the Renaissance seemed to threaten a more\r\npowerful and dangerous admixture. But the native genius of the language\r\ntriumphed, and finally, in the Pleiade reforms, reduced to harmlessness\r\nthe Rhetoriqueur innovations and the simultaneous danger of\r\nItalianising. The criticism of Malherbe, harmful in some ways, served as\r\na counterpoise to the danger of Spanish influence which was considerable\r\nin the early years of the seventeenth century, and by the eighteenth the\r\nidiosyncrasy of French was so strong that, great as was the effect\r\nsuccessively produced by English and by German, it was unable to do more\r\nthan slightly modify French literature itself. Yet again the singular\r\n[Greek: autarkeia] of French may be seen by turning from its general\r\naccomplishments at different times to its particular forms. No one of\r\nthese was directly adopted from any foreign, not even from any classical\r\nexample, with the doubtful exception of the classical tragedy. The\r\nFrench made their own epic, their own lyric, their own comic and\r\nmiscellaneous drama. They may be said almost to have invented the\r\npeculiar and striking kind of history called the memoir, which has\r\ncharacteristics distinguishing it radically from the classical\r\ncommentary. They apparently invented the essay, and though they only\r\nborrowed the beast-fable, they are entitled to the credit of having seen\r\nin it the germ of the short verse tale which has no direct moral\r\nbearing. All the nations of Europe, so to speak, sent during the middle\r\nages their own raw material of subject to be worked up by French or\r\nFrench-speaking men into literary form. France therefore gives (next to\r\nGreece, and in some respects even before Greece) the most instructive\r\nand trustworthy example extant of the chronology and order of\r\nspontaneous literary development--first poetry, then drama, then prose:\r\nin poetry, first epic, then lyric, then didactic and miscellaneous\r\nverse: in drama, first ceremonial and liturgic pieces, then comedy, then\r\nartificial tragedy: in prose, first history, then miscellaneous work,\r\nand lastly artificial and elaborate fiction. It is a curious and\r\nsomewhat complex phenomenon that the cycle which began with verse\r\nfiction should apparently end with fiction in prose, but the foregoing\r\npages will have shewn sufficiently how dangerous it would be to\r\ngeneralise from this.\r\n\r\nOne thing however may be safely concluded from the mere fact of this\r\nremarkable resistance to foreign influence, or rather from the still\r\nmore remarkable power of assimilation which this resistance implies. The\r\nliterature which has been able to exert both must have very strongly\r\nmarked general characteristics of its own. As a matter of fact French\r\nliterature has these characteristics: and a brief enumeration and\r\ndescription of them may complete, more appropriately than anything else\r\ncould do, the survey of its history. French literature, notwithstanding\r\nthe revolution of fifty years ago, is generally and rightly held to be\r\nthe chief representative among the greater European literatures of the\r\nclassical rather than the romantic spirit. It is therefore necessary to\r\ndefine what is meant by these much controverted terms; and the\r\ndefinition which best expresses the views of the present writer is one\r\nsomewhat modified from the definition given by Heine. The terms classic\r\nand romantic apply to treatment not to subject, and the difference is\r\nthat the treatment is classic when the idea is represented as directly\r\nand with as exact an adaptation of form as possible, while it is\r\nromantic when the idea is left to the reader's faculty of divination\r\nassisted only by suggestion and symbol. Of these two modes of treatment\r\nFrance has always inclined to the classic: during at least two\r\ncenturies, the seventeenth and eighteenth, she relied upon it almost\r\nwholly. But the fertility of her mediaeval and Renaissance literature in\r\nstrictly romantic examples, and the general tendency of the literature\r\nof the nineteenth century, have shewn a romantic faculty inferior, but\r\nonly inferior, to the classical. To illustrate this statement by a\r\ncontrast, it may be pointed out that in Greek the romantic element is\r\nalmost in abeyance, while in English all without exception of our\r\ngreatest masterpieces have been purely romantic. Or to put the matter in\r\nyet other words, the sense of the vague is, among authors of the highest\r\nrank, rarely present to a Greek, always present to an Englishman, and\r\nalternately present and absent, but oftener absent, to a Frenchman.\r\n\r\nThe qualities which this general differentia has developed in French may\r\nnow be enumerated.\r\n\r\nThe first is a great and remarkable _sobriety_. It is true that there is\r\nnothing more extravagant than an extravagant Frenchman, but that is the\r\nnatural result of reaction. As a rule, the contributions of matter which\r\nFrance received so abundantly from other nations are always toned and\r\nsobered by her in their literary formation. The main materials of her\r\nwonderful mediaeval literature of fiction were furnished by Wales, by\r\nGermany, and by the East; all of them, to judge by the later but more or\r\nless independent handlings which we have from indigenous sources, must\r\nhave teemed with the supernatural. In the Chansons de Gestes, in the\r\nArthurian romances, and even in the earlier Romans d'Aventures, the\r\nsupernatural, though recognised as became a devout age and country, is\r\nyet to a certain extent rationalised. It rarely obtrudes itself, and it\r\nstill more rarely presents itself with exaggerated attributes. A\r\ncontinual spirit of criticism exhibits itself throughout French\r\nliterature; it always, as represented by its most numerous and on the\r\nwhole most famous representatives, tends to order, to measure, to\r\nsymmetry.\r\n\r\nThe next characteristic is abundant and almost superabundant _wit_. The\r\nterms wit and humour have been argued over even more than classical and\r\nromantic, and it is equally impossible to enter into the controversy\r\nhere. Suffice it to say that, according to the most satisfactory\r\ndefinition of humour (thinking in jest while feeling in earnest), wit\r\nmight be defined to be thinking in jest without interrogating the\r\nconsciousness as to whether the feeling is earnest or not. At a very\r\nearly period, as soon indeed as the French spirit had thoroughly emerged\r\nfrom its German-Latin-Celtic swaddling clothes, this faculty of half\r\nreckless thinking in jest made its appearance. In classical literature\r\nwit is notoriously absent with rare exceptions (Aristophanes and Lucian\r\nbeing almost the only ones of importance); in scarcely any other modern\r\nliterature does it make its appearance early. But it shows in French by\r\nthe twelfth century, and it increases during every century that\r\nsucceeds: while joined to sobriety it begets that satirical criticism,\r\nwhich is so noteworthy a secondary product of French.\r\n\r\nA third quality closely connected with the two former but not, like\r\nsatirical criticism, simply derived from them, is the close _attention\r\nto form_ which has always distinguished French. At the present time,\r\ndespite the great advance made by other literatures and a certain\r\nfalling off in itself, French prose is on the average superior in formal\r\nmerit to any other prose written in a modern language. If we look back\r\nfor eight hundred years, French verse is found to be more carefully and\r\nartistically arranged than the corresponding poetical beginnings of any\r\nother European country. In the excogitation of careful rules and the\r\ndeft carrying out of those rules no literature can on the whole approach\r\nthis except Greek. No literature therefore, with that exception, gives\r\nso much of the pleasure which is given by the spectacle of not\r\nunreasonable difficulty skilfully overcome in a game which is well\r\nplayed.\r\n\r\nA fourth merit is to be found in the _inventiveness_ of Frenchmen of\r\nletters. In no literature is there a greater variety, and in none is\r\nthat variety so obviously the effect not of happy blundering but of\r\norganised and almost scientific development of the possibilities of art.\r\nThe wonderful fertility with which the early Trouveres handled and\r\nre-handled the motives of the Arthurian and Carlovingian legends has\r\nbeen noticed; and, as a very different but complementary instance, the\r\nsurprising success and variety with which a scheme so limited as that of\r\nthe classical tragedy was applied, deserves mention. At the present day\r\nin one important department of literature (the drama) inventiveness is\r\nalmost limited to Frenchmen, and there are few periods of their present\r\nhistory at which they have not in this respect led the van in one\r\ndepartment or in another.\r\n\r\nYet another characteristic must be noted, which is, in respect to\r\nmatter, the complement of the already mentioned attention to form. This\r\nis the singular _clearness_ and _precision_ with which not merely the\r\ngreatest Frenchmen of letters, but all save the least, are accustomed to\r\nput their meaning. Whereas the two great classical languages, from the\r\nlicence of order given by their abundant inflections and complicated\r\nsyntax, are sometimes enigmatic; whereas German notoriously lends itself\r\nto the wrapping up of a simple meaning in a cloud of words; whereas\r\nEnglish seems to encourage those who use it not indeed to obscurity but\r\nto desultoriness and beating about the bush, French properly used is\r\nalmost automatically clear and precise. Rivarol's somewhat sententious\r\nconceit that the French language has a 'probite attachee a son genie' is\r\nnot a conceit merely. That this lucidity is sometimes accompanied by\r\nwant of depth is quite true, but it is equally true that it is often\r\nmistaken for it. There is no want of depth in Descartes or in\r\nMalebranche, yet there are no clearer writers in the whole range of\r\nphilosophic literature.\r\n\r\nTo these main characteristics others which are in a way corollaries\r\nmight be added, such as urbanity, ease, ready adaptation to different\r\nclasses of subject, and the like. But those already dwelt upon are the\r\nprincipal, and they have sufficed to make French, as far as general\r\nusefulness and interest go, the best vehicle of expression in prose\r\namong European languages. In poetry it is not quite the same. Most of\r\nthe qualities just enumerated are in poetry but of secondary use, some\r\nof them are almost directly unfavourable to the vagueness, the\r\nindefinite suggestion, the 'making the common uncommon,' which are\r\nnecessary to poetry. The clearness of French prose has a tendency to\r\nbecome colourless in French poetry, its sobriety turns to the bald, its\r\nwit to conceits and prettinesses, its inventiveness to an undue reliance\r\non complicated devices for creating an artificial attraction, its sense\r\nof form and rule to dryness and lack of passion. Moreover the merely\r\nsonorous qualities of French render it a difficult instrument for the\r\nproduction of varied poetical sounds. It is almost wholly destitute of\r\nquantity, and the intonation which supplies that want is of such a kind\r\nthat hardly any foot but the iambus is possible in it. On the other hand\r\nits terminations admit of elaborate and harmonious rhymes (indeed French\r\npoetry without rhyme is a practical impossibility), and the abundance of\r\nmute _e_ endings has facilitated the adoption of an artificial source of\r\nvariation of sound in the so-called 'masculine and feminine' rhyming\r\nwhich is in its perfection almost peculiar to the language. With these\r\naids and by the most elaborate attention to metre and euphony, the great\r\npoets of France have been enabled to surmount to a very large extent the\r\ncorresponding difficulties of their prosody. But they have not on the\r\nwhole been equally fortunate in surmounting the difficulties caused by\r\nthe very genius of the language--the clear, sober, critical _ethos_ of\r\nFrench. This is an enemy to mystery, to vagueness, to what may be called\r\nthe twilight of sense--all things more or less necessary to the highest\r\npoetry. It will not I think be alleged by any impartial reader of this\r\nbook that its author is insensible to the majesty or to the charm of\r\nFrench verse. But it is impossible for me to admit that that majesty and\r\nthat charm are shewn in the highest degree (in the degree in which not\r\nmerely Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Shelley, Heine, shew them, but many minor\r\nnames in Greek, in English, and in German), by any but a very few\r\nFrenchmen, and by these in more than comparatively few places. A very\r\ncompetent and obliging French critic has said that it is impossible for\r\nany Frenchman to agree with me exactly in my estimate of La Fontaine,\r\nand probably there is no better instance than La Fontaine of the\r\nfundamental difference of conception of poetry which corresponds to the\r\nEnglish channel. Inexhaustibly inventive, full of criticism of life, a\r\nmaster of harmonious language, managing rhythms and metres with a skill\r\nonly the more artful that it seems so artless, La Fontaine yet has too\r\nlittle of dawn or sunset, still less of twilight or moonlight, too much\r\nof the light of common day to deserve, according to my estimate, the\r\ntitle of poet in the highest degree. The same may be said of most other\r\nFrench poets except a few who are to be found almost exclusively in the\r\nmiddle ages, in the Renaissance, and in the nineteenth century. Only in\r\none form of the highest poetry, the passionate declamation which is in\r\neffect oratory of the most picturesque kind, France has never been\r\nwanting, and in this she has for half the time been mightily helped by\r\nthe possession of the magnificent Alexandrine metre.\r\n\r\n[294]At the close of the eleventh century and at the beginning of the\r\ntwelfth we find the vulgar tongue in France not merely in full\r\norganisation for literary purposes, but already employed in most of the\r\nforms of poetical writing. An immense outburst of epic and narrative\r\nverse has taken place, and lyrical poetry, not limited as in the case of\r\nthe epics to the north of France, but extending from Roussillon to the\r\nPas de Calais, completes this. The twelfth century adds to these\r\nearliest forms the important development of the mystery, extends the\r\nsubjects and varies the manner of epic verse, and begins the\r\ncompositions of literary prose with the chronicles of St. Denis and of\r\nVillehardouin, and the prose romances of the Arthurian cycle. All this\r\nliterature is so far connected purely with the knightly and priestly\r\norders, though it is largely composed and still more largely dealt in by\r\nclasses of men, trouveres and jongleurs, who are not necessarily either\r\nknights or priests, and in the case of the jongleurs are certainly\r\nneither. With a possible ancestry of Romance and Teutonic _cantilenae_,\r\nBreton _lais_, and vernacular legends, the new literature has a certain\r\npattern and model in Latin and for the most part ecclesiastical\r\ncompositions. It has the sacred books and the legends of the saints for\r\nexamples of narrative, the rhythm of the hymns for a guide to metre, and\r\nthe ceremonies of the church for a stimulant to dramatic performance. By\r\ndegrees also in this twelfth century forms of literature which busy\r\nthemselves with the unprivileged classes begin to be born. The fabliau\r\ntakes every phase of life for its subject; the folk-song acquires\r\nelegance and does not lose raciness and truth. In the next century, the\r\nthirteenth, mediaeval literature in France arrives at its zenith and\r\nremains there until the first quarter of the fourteenth. The early epics\r\nlose something of their savage charm, the polished literature of\r\nProvence quickly perishes. But in the provinces which speak the more\r\nprevailing tongue nothing is wanting to literary development. The\r\nlanguage itself has shaken off all its youthful incapacities, and,\r\nthough not yet well adapted for the requirements of modern life and\r\nstudy, is in every way equal to the demands made upon it by its own\r\ntime. The dramatic germ contained in the fabliau and quickened by the\r\nmystery produces the profane drama. Ambitious works of merit in the most\r\nvarious kinds are published; _Aucassin et Nicolette_ stands side by side\r\nwith the _Histoire de Saint Louis_, the _Jeu de la Feuillie_ with the\r\n_Miracle de Theophile_, the _Roman de la Rose_ with the _Roman du\r\nRenart_. The earliest notes of ballade and rondeau are heard; endeavours\r\nare made with zeal, and not always without understanding, to naturalise\r\nthe wisdom of the ancients in France, and in the graceful tongue that\r\nFrance possesses. Romance in prose and verse, drama, history, songs,\r\nsatire, oratory, and even erudition, are all represented and represented\r\nworthily. Meanwhile all nations of Western Europe have come to France\r\nfor their literary models and subjects, and the greatest writers in\r\nEnglish, German, Italian, content themselves with adaptations of\r\nChretien de Troyes, of Benoist de Sainte More, and of a hundred other\r\nknown and unknown trouveres and fabulists. But this age does not last\r\nlong. The language has been put to all the uses of which it is as yet\r\ncapable; those uses in their sameness begin to pall upon reader and\r\nhearer; and the enormous evils of the civil and religious state reflect\r\nthemselves inevitably in literature. The old forms die out or are\r\nprolonged only in half-lifeless travesties. The brilliant colouring of\r\nFroissart, and the graceful science of ballade- and rondeau-writers like\r\nLescurel and Deschamps, alone maintain the literary reputation of the\r\ntime. Towards the end of the fourteenth century the translators and\r\npolitical writers import many terms of art, and strain the language to\r\nuses for which it is as yet unhandy, though at the beginning of the next\r\nage Charles d'Orleans by his natural grace and the virtue of the forms\r\nhe used, emerges from the mass of writers. Throughout the fifteenth\r\ncentury the process of enriching or at least increasing the vocabulary\r\ngoes on, but as yet no organising hand appears to direct the process.\r\nVillon stands alone in merit as in peculiarity. But in this time\r\ndramatic literature and the literature of the floating popular\r\nbroadsheet acquire an immense extension--all or almost all the vigour of\r\nspirit being concentrated in the rough farce and rougher lampoon, while\r\nall the literary skill is engrossed by insipid _rhetoriqueurs_ and\r\npedants. Then comes the grand upheaval of the Renaissance and the\r\nReformation. An immense influx of science, of thought to make the\r\nscience living, of new terms to express the thought, takes place, and a\r\nband of literary workers appear of power enough to master and get into\r\nshape the turbid mass. Rabelais, Amyot, Calvin, and Herberay fashion\r\nFrench prose; Marot, Ronsard, and Regnier refashion French verse. The\r\nPleiade introduces the drama as it is to be and the language that is to\r\nhelp the drama to express itself. Montaigne for the first time throws\r\ninvention and originality into some other form than verse or than prose\r\nfiction. But by the end of the century the tide has receded. The work of\r\narrangement has been but half done, and there are no master spirits left\r\nto complete it. At this period Malherbe and Balzac make their\r\nappearance. Unable to deal with the whole problem, they determine to\r\ndeal with part of it, and to reject a portion of the riches of which\r\nthey feel themselves unfit to be stewards. Balzac and his successors\r\nmake of French prose an instrument faultless and admirable in precision,\r\nunequalled for the work for which it is fit, but unfit for certain\r\nportions of the work which it was once able to perform. Malherbe,\r\nseconded by Boileau, makes of French verse an instrument suited only for\r\nthe purposes of the drama of Euripides, or rather of Seneca, with or\r\nwithout its chorus, and for a certain weakened echo of that chorus,\r\nunder the name of lyrics. No French verse of the first merit other than\r\ndramatic is written for two whole centuries. The drama soon comes to its\r\nacme, and during the succeeding time usually maintains itself at a\r\nfairly high level until the death of Voltaire. But prose lends itself to\r\nalmost everything that is required of it, and becomes constantly a more\r\nand more perfect instrument. To the highest efforts of pathos and\r\nsublimity its vocabulary and its arrangement are still unsuited, though\r\nthe great preachers of the seventeenth century do their utmost with it.\r\nBut for clear exposition, smooth and agreeable narrative, sententious\r\nand pointed brevity, witty repartee, it soon proves itself to have no\r\nsuperior and scarcely an equal in Europe. In these directions\r\npractitioners of the highest skill apply it during the seventeenth\r\ncentury, while during the eighteenth its powers are shown to the utmost\r\nof their variety by Voltaire, and receive a new development at the hands\r\nof Rousseau. Yet, on the whole, it loses during this century. It becomes\r\nmore and more unfit for any but trivial uses, and at last it is employed\r\nfor those uses only. Then occurs the Revolution, repeating the mighty\r\nstir in men's minds which the Renaissance had given, but at first\r\nexperiencing more difficulty in breaking up the ground and once more\r\nrendering it fertile. The faulty and incomplete genius of Chateaubriand\r\nand Madame de Stael gives the first evidence of a new growth, and after\r\nmany years the romantic movement completes the work. That movement\r\noccupied almost the whole of two generations and though at the close of\r\nthe second its force may appear to be spent, the results remain, and no\r\nnew or reactionary movement is visible, and the efforts of the Romantics\r\nthemselves have been crowned with an almost complete regeneration of\r\nletters, if not of language. The poetical power of French has been once\r\nmore triumphantly proved, and its productiveness in all branches of\r\nliterature has been renewed, while in that of prose fiction there has\r\nbeen almost created a new class of composition.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may sum up even this summary. For volume and merit taken\r\ntogether the product of these eight centuries of literature excels that\r\nof any European nation, though for individual works of the supremest\r\nexcellence they may perhaps be asked in vain. No French writer is lifted\r\nby the suffrages of other nations--the only criterion when sufficient\r\ntime has elapsed--to the level of Homer, of Shakespeare, or of Dante,\r\nwho reign alone. Of those of the authors of France who are indeed of the\r\nthirty but attain not to the first three, Rabelais and Moliere alone\r\nunite the general suffrage; and this fact roughly but surely points to\r\nthe real excellence of the literature which these men are chosen to\r\nrepresent. It is great in all ways, but it is greatest on the lighter\r\nside. The house of mirth is more suited to it than the house of\r\nmourning. To the latter, indeed, the language of the unknown minstrel\r\nwho told Roland's death, of him who gave utterance to Camilla's wrath\r\nand despair, and of him who in our day sang how the mountain wind makes\r\nmad the lover who cannot forget, has amply made good its title of\r\nentrance. But for one Frenchman who can write admirably in this strain\r\nthere are a hundred who can tell the most admirable story, formulate the\r\nmost pregnant reflexion, point the acutest jest. There is thus no really\r\ngreat epic in French, few great tragedies, and those imperfect and in a\r\nfaulty kind, little prose like Milton's or like Jeremy Taylor's, little\r\nverse (though more than is generally thought) like Shelley's or like\r\nSpenser's. But there are the most delightful short tales, both in prose\r\nand in verse, that the world has ever seen, the most polished jewellery\r\nof reflexion that has ever been wrought, songs of incomparable grace,\r\ncomedies that must make men laugh so long as they are laughing animals,\r\nand above all such a body of narrative fiction, old and new, prose and\r\nverse, as no other nation can show for art and for originality, for\r\ngrace of workmanship in him who fashions, and for certainty of delight\r\nto him who reads.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[294] The courtesy of Messrs.
