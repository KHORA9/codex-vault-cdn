Original sources have been drawn upon in\r\nthe majority of cases, and nearly all of these are the most recent\r\nattainable. Whenever it has not been possible to cite original and recent\r\nworks, the author has quoted only such as are most standard and\r\ntrustworthy. In the choice of orthography of proper names and numeral\r\nwords, the forms have, in almost all cases, been written as they were\r\nfound, with no attempt to reduce them to a systematic English basis. In\r\nmany instances this would have been quite impossible; and, even if\r\npossible, it would have been altogether unimportant. Hence the forms,\r\nwhether German, French, Italian, Spanish, or Danish in their transcription,\r\nare left unchanged. Diacritical marks are omitted, however, since the\r\nproper key could hardly be furnished in a work of this kind.\r\n\r\nWith the above exceptions, this study will, it is hoped, be found to be\r\nquite complete; and as the subject here investigated has never before been\r\ntreated in any thorough and comprehensive manner, it is hoped that this\r\nbook may be found helpful. The collections of numeral systems illustrating\r\nthe use of the binary, the quinary, and other number systems, are, taken\r\ntogether, believed to be the most extensive now existing in any language.\r\nOnly the cardinal numerals have been considered. The ordinals present no\r\nmarked peculiarities which would, in a work of this kind, render a separate\r\ndiscussion necessary. Accordingly they have, though with some reluctance,\r\nbeen omitted entirely.\r\n\r\nSincere thanks are due to those who have assisted the author in the\r\npreparation of his materials. Especial acknowledgment should be made to\r\nHoratio Hale, Dr. D.G. Brinton, Frank Hamilton Cushing, and Dr. A.F.\r\nChamberlain.\r\n\r\nWORCESTER, MASS., Nov. 12, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\nCounting 1\r\nChapter II.\r\nNumber System Limits 21\r\nChapter III.\r\nOrigin of Number Words 37\r\nChapter IV.\r\nOrigin of Number Words (_continued_) 74\r\nChapter V.\r\nMiscellaneous Number Bases 100\r\nChapter VI.\r\nThe Quinary System 134\r\nChapter VII.\r\nThe Vigesimal System 176\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\nIndex 211\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NUMBER CONCEPT: ITS ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCOUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the speculative questions which arise in connection with the study of\r\narithmetic from a historical standpoint, the origin of number is one that\r\nhas provoked much lively discussion, and has led to a great amount of\r\nlearned research among the primitive and savage languages of the human\r\nrace. A few simple considerations will, however, show that such research\r\nmust necessarily leave this question entirely unsettled, and will indicate\r\nclearly that it is, from the very nature of things, a question to which no\r\ndefinite and final answer can be given.\r\n\r\nAmong the barbarous tribes whose languages have been studied, even in a\r\nmost cursory manner, none have ever been discovered which did not show some\r\nfamiliarity with the number concept. The knowledge thus indicated has often\r\nproved to be most limited; not extending beyond the numbers 1 and 2, or 1,\r\n2, and 3. Examples of this poverty of number knowledge are found among the\r\nforest tribes of Brazil, the native races of Australia and elsewhere, and\r\nthey are considered in some detail in the next chapter. At first thought it\r\nseems quite inconceivable that any human being should be destitute of the\r\npower of counting beyond 2. But such is the case; and in a few instances\r\nlanguages have been found to be absolutely destitute of pure numeral words.\r\nThe Chiquitos of Bolivia had no real numerals whatever,[1] but expressed\r\ntheir idea for \"one\" by the word _etama_, meaning alone. The Tacanas of the\r\nsame country have no numerals except those borrowed from Spanish, or from\r\nAymara or Peno, languages with which they have long been in contact.[2] A\r\nfew other South American languages are almost equally destitute of numeral\r\nwords. But even here, rudimentary as the number sense undoubtedly is, it is\r\nnot wholly lacking; and some indirect expression, or some form of\r\ncircumlocution, shows a conception of the difference between _one_ and\r\n_two_, or at least, between _one_ and _many_.\r\n\r\nThese facts must of necessity deter the mathematician from seeking to push\r\nhis investigation too far back toward the very origin of number.\r\nPhilosophers have endeavoured to establish certain propositions concerning\r\nthis subject, but, as might have been expected, have failed to reach any\r\ncommon ground of agreement. Whewell has maintained that \"such propositions\r\nas that two and three make five are necessary truths, containing in them an\r\nelement of certainty beyond that which mere experience can give.\" Mill, on\r\nthe other hand, argues that any such statement merely expresses a truth\r\nderived from early and constant experience; and in this view he is heartily\r\nsupported by Tylor.[3] But why this question should provoke controversy, it\r\nis difficult for the mathematician to understand. Either view would seem to\r\nbe correct, according to the standpoint from which the question is\r\napproached. We know of no language in which the suggestion of number does\r\nnot appear, and we must admit that the words which give expression to the\r\nnumber sense would be among the early words to be formed in any language.\r\nThey express ideas which are, at first, wholly concrete, which are of the\r\ngreatest possible simplicity, and which seem in many ways to be clearly\r\nunderstood, even by the higher orders of the brute creation. The origin of\r\nnumber would in itself, then, appear to lie beyond the proper limits of\r\ninquiry; and the primitive conception of number to be fundamental with\r\nhuman thought.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the assertion that the idea of number seems to be\r\nunderstood by the higher orders of animals, the following brief quotation\r\nfrom a paper by Sir John Lubbock may not be out of place: \"Leroy ...\r\nmentions a case in which a man was anxious to shoot a crow. 'To deceive\r\nthis suspicious bird, the plan was hit upon of sending two men to the watch\r\nhouse, one of whom passed on, while the other remained; but the crow\r\ncounted and kept her distance. The next day three went, and again she\r\nperceived that only two retired. In fine, it was found necessary to send\r\nfive or six men to the watch house to put her out in her calculation. The\r\ncrow, thinking that this number of men had passed by, lost no time in\r\nreturning.' From this he inferred that crows could count up to four.\r\nLichtenberg mentions a nightingale which was said to count up to three.\r\nEvery day he gave it three mealworms, one at a time. When it had finished\r\none it returned for another, but after the third it knew that the feast was\r\nover.... There is an amusing and suggestive remark in Mr. Galton's\r\ninteresting _Narrative of an Explorer in Tropical South Africa_. After\r\ndescribing the Demara's weakness in calculations, he says: 'Once while I\r\nwatched a Demara floundering hopelessly in a calculation on one side of me,\r\nI observed, \"Dinah,\" my spaniel, equally embarrassed on the other; she was\r\noverlooking half a dozen of her new-born puppies, which had been removed\r\ntwo or three times from her, and her anxiety was excessive, as she tried to\r\nfind out if they were all present, or if any were still missing. She kept\r\npuzzling and running her eyes over them backwards and forwards, but could\r\nnot satisfy herself. She evidently had a vague notion of counting, but the\r\nfigure was too large for her brain. Taking the two as they stood, dog and\r\nDemara, the comparison reflected no great honour on the man....' According\r\nto my bird-nesting recollections, which I have refreshed by more recent\r\nexperience, if a nest contains four eggs, one may safely be taken; but if\r\ntwo are removed, the bird generally deserts. Here, then, it would seem as\r\nif we had some reason for supposing that there is sufficient intelligence\r\nto distinguish three from four. An interesting consideration arises with\r\nreference to the number of the victims allotted to each cell by the\r\nsolitary wasps. One species of Ammophila considers one large caterpillar of\r\n_Noctua segetum_ enough; one species of Eumenes supplies its young with\r\nfive victims; another 10, 15, and even up to 24. The number appears to be\r\nconstant in each species. How does the insect know when her task is\r\nfulfilled? Not by the cell being filled, for if some be removed, she does\r\nnot replace them. When she has brought her complement she considers her\r\ntask accomplished, whether the victims are still there or not. How, then,\r\ndoes she know when she has made up the number 24? Perhaps it will be said\r\nthat each species feels some mysterious and innate tendency to provide a\r\ncertain number of victims. This would, under no circumstances, be any\r\nexplanation; but it is not in accordance with the facts. In the genus\r\nEumenes the males are much smaller than the females.... If the egg is male,\r\nshe supplies five; if female, 10 victims. Does she count? Certainly this\r\nseems very like a commencement of arithmetic.\"[4]\r\n\r\nMany writers do not agree with the conclusions which Lubbock reaches;\r\nmaintaining that there is, in all such instances, a perception of greater\r\nor less quantity rather than any idea of number. But a careful\r\nconsideration of the objections offered fails entirely to weaken the\r\nargument. Example after example of a nature similar to those just quoted\r\nmight be given, indicating on the part of animals a perception of the\r\ndifference between 1 and 2, or between 2 and 3 and 4; and any reasoning\r\nwhich tends to show that it is quantity rather than number which the animal\r\nperceives, will apply with equal force to the Demara, the Chiquito, and the\r\nAustralian. Hence the actual origin of number may safely be excluded from\r\nthe limits of investigation, and, for the present, be left in the field of\r\npure speculation.\r\n\r\nA most inviting field for research is, however, furnished by the primitive\r\nmethods of counting and of giving visible expression to the idea of number.\r\nOur starting-point must, of course, be the sign language, which always\r\nprecedes intelligible speech; and which is so convenient and so expressive\r\na method of communication that the human family, even in its most highly\r\ndeveloped branches, never wholly lays it aside. It may, indeed, be stated\r\nas a universal law, that some practical method of numeration has, in the\r\nchildhood of every nation or tribe, preceded the formation of numeral\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nPractical methods of numeration are many in number and diverse in kind. But\r\nthe one primitive method of counting which seems to have been almost\r\nuniversal throughout all time is the finger method. It is a matter of\r\ncommon experience and observation that every child, when he begins to\r\ncount, turns instinctively to his fingers; and, with these convenient aids\r\nas counters, tallies off the little number he has in mind. This method is\r\nat once so natural and obvious that there can be no doubt that it has\r\nalways been employed by savage tribes, since the first appearance of the\r\nhuman race in remote antiquity. All research among uncivilized peoples has\r\ntended to confirm this view, were confirmation needed of anything so\r\npatent. Occasionally some exception to this rule is found; or some\r\nvariation, such as is presented by the forest tribes of Brazil, who,\r\ninstead of counting on the fingers themselves, count on the joints of their\r\nfingers.[5] As the entire number system of these tribes appears to be\r\nlimited to _three_, this variation is no cause for surprise.\r\n\r\nThe variety in practical methods of numeration observed among savage races,\r\nand among civilized peoples as well, is so great that any detailed account\r\nof them would be almost impossible. In one region we find sticks or splints\r\nused; in another, pebbles or shells; in another, simple scratches, or\r\nnotches cut in a stick, Robinson Crusoe fashion; in another, kernels or\r\nlittle heaps of grain; in another, knots on a string; and so on, in\r\ndiversity of method almost endless. Such are the devices which have been,\r\nand still are, to be found in the daily habit of great numbers of Indian,\r\nnegro, Mongolian, and Malay tribes; while, to pass at a single step to the\r\nother extremity of intellectual development, the German student keeps his\r\nbeer score by chalk marks on the table or on the wall. But back of all\r\nthese devices, and forming a common origin to which all may be referred, is\r\nthe universal finger method; the method with which all begin, and which all\r\nfind too convenient ever to relinquish entirely, even though their\r\ncivilization be of the highest type. Any such mode of counting, whether\r\ninvolving the use of the fingers or not, is to be regarded simply as an\r\nextraneous aid in the expression or comprehension of an idea which the mind\r\ncannot grasp, or cannot retain, without assistance. The German student\r\nscores his reckoning with chalk marks because he might otherwise forget;\r\nwhile the Andaman Islander counts on his fingers because he has no other\r\nmethod of counting,--or, in other words, of grasping the idea of number. A\r\nsingle illustration may be given which typifies all practical methods of\r\nnumeration. More than a century ago travellers in Madagascar observed a\r\ncurious but simple mode of ascertaining the number of soldiers in an\r\narmy.[6] Each soldier was made to go through a passage in the presence of\r\nthe principal chiefs; and as he went through, a pebble was dropped on the\r\nground. This continued until a heap of 10 was obtained, when one was set\r\naside and a new heap begun. Upon the completion of 10 heaps, a pebble was\r\nset aside to indicate 100; and so on until the entire army had been\r\nnumbered. Another illustration, taken from the very antipodes of\r\nMadagascar, recently found its way into print in an incidental manner,[7]\r\nand is so good that it deserves a place beside de Flacourt's time-honoured\r\nexample. Mom Cely, a Southern negro of unknown age, finds herself in debt\r\nto the storekeeper; and, unwilling to believe that the amount is as great\r\nas he represents, she proceeds to investigate the matter in her own\r\npeculiar way. She had \"kept a tally of these purchases by means of a\r\nstring, in which she tied commemorative knots.\" When her creditor\r\n\"undertook to make the matter clear to Cely's comprehension, he had to\r\nproceed upon a system of her own devising. A small notch was cut in a\r\nsmooth white stick for every dime she owed, and a large notch when the\r\ndimes amounted to a dollar; for every five dollars a string was tied in the\r\nfifth big notch, Cely keeping tally by the knots in her bit of twine; thus,\r\nwhen two strings were tied about the stick, the ten dollars were seen to be\r\nan indisputable fact.\" This interesting method of computing the amount of\r\nher debt, whether an invention of her own or a survival of the African life\r\nof her parents, served the old negro woman's purpose perfectly; and it\r\nillustrates, as well as a score of examples could, the methods of\r\nnumeration to which the children of barbarism resort when any number is to\r\nbe expressed which exceeds the number of counters with which nature has\r\nprovided them. The fingers are, however, often employed in counting numbers\r\nfar above the first decade. After giving the Il-Oigob numerals up to 60,\r\nMüller adds:[8] \"Above 60 all numbers, indicated by the proper figure\r\npantomime, are expressed by means of the word _ipi_.\" We know, moreover,\r\nthat many of the American Indian tribes count one ten after another on\r\ntheir fingers; so that, whatever number they are endeavouring to indicate,\r\nwe need feel no surprise if the savage continues to use his fingers\r\nthroughout the entire extent of his counts. In rare instances we find\r\ntribes which, like the Mairassis of the interior of New Guinea, appear to\r\nuse nothing but finger pantomime.[9] This tribe, though by no means\r\ndestitute of the number sense, is said to have no numerals whatever, but to\r\nuse the single word _awari_ with each show of fingers, no matter how few or\r\nhow many are displayed.\r\n\r\nIn the methods of finger counting employed by savages a considerable degree\r\nof uniformity has been observed. Not only does he use his fingers to assist\r\nhim in his tally, but he almost always begins with the little finger of his\r\nleft hand, thence proceeding towards the thumb, which is 5. From this point\r\nonward the method varies. Sometimes the second 5 also is told off on the\r\nleft hand, the same order being observed as in the first 5; but oftener the\r\nfingers of the right hand are used, with a reversal of the order previously\r\nemployed; _i.e._ the thumb denotes 6, the index finger 7, and so on to the\r\nlittle finger, which completes the count to 10.\r\n\r\nAt first thought there would seem to be no good reason for any marked\r\nuniformity of method in finger counting. Observation among children fails\r\nto detect any such thing; the child beginning, with almost entire\r\nindifference, on the thumb or on the little finger of the left hand. My own\r\nobservation leads to the conclusion that very young children have a slight,\r\nthough not decided preference for beginning with the thumb. Experiments in\r\nfive different primary rooms in the public schools of Worcester, Mass.,\r\nshowed that out of a total of 206 children, 57 began with the little finger\r\nand 149 with the thumb. But the fact that nearly three-fourths of the\r\nchildren began with the thumb, and but one-fourth with the little finger,\r\nis really far less significant than would appear at first thought. Children\r\nof this age, four to eight years, will count in either way, and sometimes\r\nseem at a loss themselves to know where to begin. In one school room where\r\nthis experiment was tried the teacher incautiously asked one child to count\r\non his fingers, while all the other children in the room watched eagerly to\r\nsee what he would do. He began with the little finger--and so did every\r\nchild in the room after him. In another case the same error was made by the\r\nteacher, and the child first asked began with the thumb. Every other child\r\nin the room did the same, each following, consciously or unconsciously, the\r\nexample of the leader. The results from these two schools were of course\r\nrejected from the totals which are given above; but they serve an excellent\r\npurpose in showing how slight is the preference which very young children\r\nhave in this particular. So slight is it that no definite law can be\r\npostulated of this age; but the tendency seems to be to hold the palm of\r\nthe hand downward, and then begin with the thumb. The writer once saw a boy\r\nabout seven years old trying to multiply 3 by 6; and his method of\r\nprocedure was as follows: holding his left hand with its palm down, he\r\ntouched with the forefinger of his right hand the thumb, forefinger, and\r\nmiddle finger successively of his left hand. Then returning to his\r\nstarting-point, he told off a second three in the same manner. This process\r\nhe continued until he had obtained 6 threes, and then he announced his\r\nresult correctly. If he had been a few years older, he might not have\r\nturned so readily to his thumb as a starting-point for any digital count.\r\nThe indifference manifested by very young children gradually disappears,\r\nand at the age of twelve or thirteen the tendency is decidedly in the\r\ndirection of beginning with the little finger. Fully three-fourths of all\r\npersons above that age will be found to count from the little finger toward\r\nthe thumb, thus reversing the proportion that was found to obtain in the\r\nprimary school rooms examined.\r\n\r\nWith respect to finger counting among civilized peoples, we fail, then, to\r\nfind any universal law; the most that can be said is that more begin with\r\nthe little finger than with the thumb. But when we proceed to the study of\r\nthis slight but important particular among savages, we find them employing\r\na certain order of succession with such substantial uniformity that the\r\nconclusion is inevitable that there must lie back of this some well-defined\r\nreason, or perhaps instinct, which guides them in their choice. This\r\ninstinct is undoubtedly the outgrowth of the almost universal\r\nright-handedness of the human race. In finger counting, whether among\r\nchildren or adults, the beginning is made on the left hand, except in the\r\ncase of left-handed individuals; and even then the start is almost as\r\nlikely to be on the left hand as on the right. Savage tribes, as might be\r\nexpected, begin with the left hand. Not only is this custom almost\r\ninvariable, when tribes as a whole are considered, but the little finger is\r\nnearly always called into requisition first. To account for this\r\nuniformity, Lieutenant Gushing gives the following theory,[10] which is\r\nwell considered, and is based on the results of careful study and\r\nobservation among the Zuñi Indians of the Southwest: \"Primitive man when\r\nabroad never lightly quit hold of his weapons. If he wanted to count, he\r\ndid as the Zuñi afield does to-day; he tucked his instrument under his left\r\narm, thus constraining the latter, but leaving the right hand free, that he\r\nmight check off with it the fingers of the rigidly elevated left hand. From\r\nthe nature of this position, however, the palm of the left hand was\r\npresented to the face of the counter, so that he had to begin his score on\r\nthe little finger of it, and continue his counting from the right leftward.\r\nAn inheritance of this may be detected to-day in the confirmed habit the\r\nZuñi has of gesticulating from the right leftward, with the fingers of the\r\nright hand over those of the left, whether he be counting and summing up,\r\nor relating in any orderly manner.\" Here, then, is the reason for this\r\notherwise unaccountable phenomenon. If savage man is universally\r\nright-handed, he will almost inevitably use the index finger of his right\r\nhand to mark the fingers counted, and he will begin his count just where it\r\nis most convenient. In his case it is with the little finger of the left\r\nhand. In the case of the child trying to multiply 3 by 6, it was with the\r\nthumb of the same hand. He had nothing to tuck under his arm; so, in\r\nraising his left hand to a position where both eye and counting finger\r\ncould readily run over its fingers, he held the palm turned away from his\r\nface. The same choice of starting-point then followed as with the\r\nsavage--the finger nearest his right hand; only in this case the finger was\r\na thumb. The deaf mute is sometimes taught in this manner, which is for him\r\nan entirely natural manner. A left-handed child might be expected to count\r\nin a left-to-right manner, beginning, probably, with the thumb of his right\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nTo the law just given, that savages begin to count on the little finger of\r\nthe left hand, there have been a few exceptions noted; and it has been\r\nobserved that the method of progression on the second hand is by no means\r\nas invariable as on the first. The Otomacs[11] of South America began their\r\ncount with the thumb, and to express the number 3 would use the thumb,\r\nforefinger, and middle finger. The Maipures,[12] oddly enough, seem to have\r\nbegun, in some cases at least, with the forefinger; for they are reported\r\nas expressing 3 by means of the fore, middle, and ring fingers. The\r\nAndamans[13] begin with the little finger of either hand, tapping the nose\r\nwith each finger in succession. If they have but one to express, they use\r\nthe forefinger of either hand, pronouncing at the same time the proper\r\nword. The Bahnars,[14] one of the native tribes of the interior of Cochin\r\nChina, exhibit no particular order in the sequence of fingers used, though\r\nthey employ their digits freely to assist them in counting. Among certain\r\nof the negro tribes of South Africa[15] the little finger of the right hand\r\nis used for 1, and their count proceeds from right to left. With them, 6 is\r\nthe thumb of the left hand, 7 the forefinger, and so on. They hold the palm\r\ndownward instead of upward, and thus form a complete and striking exception\r\nto the law which has been found to obtain with such substantial uniformity\r\nin other parts of the uncivilized world. In Melanesia a few examples of\r\npreference for beginning with the thumb may also be noticed. In the Banks\r\nIslands the natives begin by turning down the thumb of the right hand, and\r\nthen the fingers in succession to the little finger, which is 5. This is\r\nfollowed by the fingers of the left hand, both hands with closed fists\r\nbeing held up to show the completed 10. In Lepers' Island, they begin with\r\nthe thumb, but, having reached 5 with the little finger, they do not pass\r\nto the other hand, but throw up the fingers they have turned down,\r\nbeginning with the forefinger and keeping the thumb for 10.[16] In the use\r\nof the single hand this people is quite peculiar. The second 5 is almost\r\ninvariably told off by savage tribes on the second hand, though in passing\r\nfrom the one to the other primitive man does not follow any invariable law.\r\nHe marks 6 with either the thumb or the little finger. Probably the former\r\nis the more common practice, but the statement cannot be made with any\r\ndegree of certainty. Among the Zulus the sequence is from thumb to thumb,\r\nas is the case among the other South African tribes just mentioned; while\r\nthe Veis and numerous other African tribes pass from thumb to little\r\nfinger. The Eskimo, and nearly all the American Indian tribes, use the\r\ncorrespondence between 6 and the thumb; but this habit is by no means\r\nuniversal. Respecting progression from right to left or left to right on\r\nthe toes, there is no general law with which the author is familiar. Many\r\ntribes never use the toes in counting, but signify the close of the first\r\n10 by clapping the hands together, by a wave of the right hand, or by\r\ndesignating some object; after which the fingers are again used as before.\r\n\r\nOne other detail in finger counting is worthy of a moment's notice. It\r\nseems to have been the opinion of earlier investigators that in his passage\r\nfrom one finger to the next, the savage would invariably bend down, or\r\nclose, the last finger used; that is, that the count began with the fingers\r\nopen and outspread. This opinion is, however, erroneous. Several of the\r\nIndian tribes of the West[17] begin with the hand clenched, and open the\r\nfingers one by one as they proceed. This method is much less common than\r\nthe other, but that it exists is beyond question.\r\n\r\nIn the Muralug Island, in the western part of Torres Strait, a somewhat\r\nremarkable method of counting formerly existed, which grew out of, and is\r\nto be regarded as an extension of, the digital method. Beginning with the\r\nlittle finger of the left hand, the natives counted up to 5 in the usual\r\nmanner, and then, instead of passing to the other hand, or repeating the\r\ncount on the same fingers, they expressed the numbers from 6 to 10 by\r\ntouching and naming successively the left wrist, left elbow, left shoulder,\r\nleft breast, and sternum. Then the numbers from 11 to 19 were indicated by\r\nthe use, in inverse order, of the corresponding portions of the right side,\r\narm, and hand, the little finger of the right hand signifying 19. The words\r\nused were in each case the actual names of the parts touched; the same\r\nword, for example, standing for 6 and 14; but they were never used in the\r\nnumerical sense unless accompanied by the proper gesture, and bear no\r\nresemblance to the common numerals, which are but few in number. This\r\nmethod of counting is rapidly dying out among the natives of the island,\r\nand is at the present time used only by old people.[18] Variations on this\r\nmost unusual custom have been found to exist in others of the neighbouring\r\nislands, but none were exactly similar to it. One is also reminded by it of\r\na custom[19] which has for centuries prevailed among bargainers in the\r\nEast, of signifying numbers by touching the joints of each other's fingers\r\nunder a cloth. Every joint has a special signification; and the entire\r\nsystem is undoubtedly a development from finger counting. The buyer or\r\nseller will by this method express 6 or 60 by stretching out the thumb and\r\nlittle finger and closing the rest of the fingers. The addition of the\r\nfourth finger to the two thus used signifies 7 or 70; and so on. \"It is\r\nsaid that between two brokers settling a price by thus snipping with the\r\nfingers, cleverness in bargaining, offering a little more, hesitating,\r\nexpressing an obstinate refusal to go further, etc., are as clearly\r\nindicated as though the bargaining were being carried on in words.\r\n\r\nThe place occupied, in the intellectual development of man, by finger\r\ncounting and by the many other artificial methods of reckoning,--pebbles,\r\nshells, knots, the abacus, etc.,--seems to be this: The abstract processes\r\nof addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and even counting\r\nitself, present to the mind a certain degree of difficulty. To assist in\r\novercoming that difficulty, these artificial aids are called in; and, among\r\nsavages of a low degree of development, like the Australians, they make\r\ncounting possible. A little higher in the intellectual scale, among the\r\nAmerican Indians, for example, they are employed merely as an artificial\r\naid to what could be done by mental effort alone. Finally, among\r\nsemi-civilized and civilized peoples, the same processes are retained, and\r\nform a part of the daily life of almost every person who has to do with\r\ncounting, reckoning, or keeping tally in any manner whatever. They are no\r\nlonger necessary, but they are so convenient and so useful that\r\ncivilization can never dispense with them. The use of the abacus, in the\r\nform of the ordinary numeral frame, has increased greatly within the past\r\nfew years; and the time may come when the abacus in its proper form will\r\nagain find in civilized countries a use as common as that of five centuries\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIn the elaborate calculating machines of the present, such as are used by\r\nlife insurance actuaries and others having difficult computations to make,\r\nwe have the extreme of development in the direction of artificial aid to\r\nreckoning. But instead of appearing merely as an extraneous aid to a\r\ndefective intelligence, it now presents itself as a machine so complex that\r\na high degree of intellectual power is required for the mere grasp of its\r\nconstruction and method of working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nNUMBER SYSTEM LIMITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the limits to which the number systems of the various\r\nuncivilized races of the earth extend, recent anthropological research has\r\ndeveloped many interesting facts. In the case of the Chiquitos and a few\r\nother native races of Bolivia we found no distinct number sense at all, as\r\nfar as could be judged from the absence, in their language, of numerals in\r\nthe proper sense of the word. How they indicated any number greater than\r\n_one_ is a point still requiring investigation. In all other known\r\ninstances we find actual number systems, or what may for the sake of\r\nuniformity be dignified by that name. In many cases, however, the numerals\r\nexisting are so few, and the ability to count is so limited, that the term\r\n_number system_ is really an entire misnomer.\r\n\r\nAmong the rudest tribes, those whose mode of living approaches most nearly\r\nto utter savagery, we find a certain uniformity of method. The entire\r\nnumber system may consist of but two words, _one_ and _many_; or of three\r\nwords, _one_, _two_, _many_. Or, the count may proceed to 3, 4, 5, 10, 20,\r\nor 100; passing always, or almost always, from the distinct numeral limit\r\nto the indefinite _many_ or several, which serves for the expression of any\r\nnumber not readily grasped by the mind. As a matter of fact, most races\r\ncount as high as 10; but to this statement the exceptions are so numerous\r\nthat they deserve examination in some detail. In certain parts of the\r\nworld, notably among the native races of South America, Australia, and many\r\nof the islands of Polynesia and Melanesia, a surprising paucity of numeral\r\nwords has been observed. The Encabellada of the Rio Napo have but two\r\ndistinct numerals; _tey_, 1, and _cayapa_, 2.[20] The Chaco languages[21]\r\nof the Guaycuru stock are also notably poor in this respect. In the Mbocobi\r\ndialect of this language the only native numerals are _yña tvak_, 1, and\r\n_yfioaca_, 2. The Puris[22] count _omi_, 1, _curiri_, 2, _prica_, many; and\r\nthe Botocudos[23] _mokenam_, 1, _uruhu_, many. The Fuegans,[24] supposed to\r\nhave been able at one time to count to 10, have but three\r\nnumerals,--_kaoueli_, 1, _compaipi_, 2, _maten_, 3. The Campas of Peru[25]\r\npossess only three separate words for the expression of number,--_patrio_,\r\n1, _pitteni_, 2, _mahuani_, 3. Above 3 they proceed by combinations, as 1\r\nand 3 for 4, 1 and 1 and 3 for 5. Counting above 10 is, however, entirely\r\ninconceivable to them, and any number beyond that limit they indicate by\r\n_tohaine_, many. The Conibos,[26] of the same region, had, before their\r\ncontact with the Spanish, only _atchoupre_, 1, and _rrabui_, 2; though they\r\nmade some slight progress above 2 by means of reduplication. The Orejones,\r\none of the low, degraded tribes of the Upper Amazon,[27] have no names for\r\nnumber except _nayhay_, 1, _nenacome_, 2, _feninichacome_, 3,\r\n_ononoeomere_, 4. In the extensive vocabularies given by Von Martins,[28]\r\nmany similar examples are found. For the Bororos he gives only _couai_, 1,\r\n_maeouai_, 2, _ouai_, 3. The last word, with the proper finger pantomime,\r\nserves also for any higher number which falls within the grasp of their\r\ncomprehension. The Guachi manage to reach 5, but their numeration is of the\r\nrudest kind, as the following scale shows: _tamak_, 1, _eu-echo,_ 2,\r\n_eu-echo-kailau,_ 3, _eu-echo-way,_ 4, _localau_, 5. The Carajas counted by\r\na scale equally rude, and their conception of number seemed equally vague,\r\nuntil contact with the neighbouring tribes furnished them with the means of\r\ngoing beyond their original limit. Their scale shows clearly the uncertain,\r\nfeeble number sense which is so marked in the interior of South America. It\r\ncontains _wadewo_, 1, _wadebothoa_, 2, _wadeboaheodo_, 3, _wadebojeodo_,\r\n4, _wadewajouclay_, 5, _wadewasori_, 6, or many.\r\n\r\nTurning to the languages of the extinct, or fast vanishing, tribes of\r\nAustralia, we find a still more noteworthy absence of numeral expressions.\r\nIn the Gudang dialect[29] but two numerals are found--_pirman_, 1, and\r\n_ilabiu_, 2; in the Weedookarry, _ekkamurda_, 1, and _kootera_, 2; and in\r\nthe Queanbeyan, _midjemban_, 1, and _bollan_, 2. In a score or more of\r\ninstances the numerals stop at 3. The natives of Keppel Bay count _webben_,\r\n1, _booli_, 2, _koorel_, 3; of the Boyne River, _karroon_, 1, _boodla_, 2,\r\n_numma_, 3; of the Flinders River, _kooroin_, 1, _kurto_, 2, _kurto\r\nkooroin_, 3; at the mouth of the Norman River, _lum_, 1, _buggar_, 2,\r\n_orinch_, 3; the Eaw tribe, _koothea_, 1, _woother_, 2, _marronoo_, 3; the\r\nMoree, _mal_, 1, _boolar_, 2, _kooliba_, 3; the Port Essington,[30] _erad_,\r\n1, _nargarick_, 2, _nargarickelerad_, 3; the Darnly Islanders,[31] _netat_,\r\n1, _naes_, 2, _naesa netat_, 3; and so on through a long list of tribes\r\nwhose numeral scales are equally scanty. A still larger number of tribes\r\nshow an ability to count one step further, to 4; but beyond this limit the\r\nmajority of Australian and Tasmanian tribes do not go. It seems most\r\nremarkable that any human being should possess the ability to count to 4,\r\nand not to 5. The number of fingers on one hand furnishes so obvious a\r\nlimit to any of these rudimentary systems, that positive evidence is needed\r\nbefore one can accept the statement. A careful examination of the numerals\r\nin upwards of a hundred Australian dialects leaves no doubt, however, that\r\nsuch is the fact. The Australians in almost all cases count by pairs; and\r\nso pronounced is this tendency that they pay but little attention to the\r\nfingers. Some tribes do not appear ever to count beyond 2--a single pair.\r\nMany more go one step further; but if they do, they are as likely as not to\r\ndesignate their next numeral as two-one, or possibly, one-two. If this step\r\nis taken, we may or may not find one more added to it, thus completing the\r\nsecond pair. Still, the Australian's capacity for understanding anything\r\nwhich pertains to number is so painfully limited that even here there is\r\nsometimes an indefinite expression formed, as many, heap, or plenty,\r\ninstead of any distinct numeral; and it is probably true that no Australian\r\nlanguage contains a pure, simple numeral for 4. Curr, the best authority on\r\nthis subject, believes that, where a distinct word for 4 is given,\r\ninvestigators have been deceived in every case.[32] If counting is carried\r\nbeyond 4, it is always by means of reduplication. A few tribes gave\r\nexpressions for 5, fewer still for 6, and a very small number appeared able\r\nto reach 7. Possibly the ability to count extended still further; but if\r\nso, it consisted undoubtedly in reckoning one pair after another, without\r\nany consciousness whatever of the sum total save as a larger number.\r\n\r\nThe numerals of a few additional tribes will show clearly that all distinct\r\nperception of number is lost as soon as these races attempt to count above\r\n3, or at most, 4. The Yuckaburra[33] natives can go no further than\r\n_wigsin_, 1, _bullaroo_, 2, _goolbora_, 3. Above here all is referred to as\r\n_moorgha_, many. The Marachowies[34] have but three distinct\r\nnumerals,--_cooma_, 1, _cootera_, 2, _murra_, 3. For 4 they say _minna_,\r\nmany. At Streaky Bay we find a similar list, with the same words, _kooma_\r\nand _kootera_, for 1 and 2, but entirely different terms, _karboo_ and\r\n_yalkata_ for 3 and many. The same method obtains in the Minnal Yungar\r\ntribe, where the only numerals are _kain_, 1, _kujal_, 2, _moa_, 3, and\r\n_bulla_, plenty. In the Pinjarra dialect we find _doombart_, 1, _gugal_, 2,\r\n_murdine_, 3, _boola_, plenty; and in the dialect described as belonging to\r\n\"Eyre's Sand Patch,\" three definite terms are given--_kean_, 1, _koojal_,\r\n2, _yalgatta_, 3, while a fourth, _murna_, served to describe anything\r\ngreater. In all these examples the fourth numeral is indefinite; and the\r\nsame statement is true of many other Australian languages. But more\r\ncommonly still we find 4, and perhaps 3 also, expressed by reduplication.\r\nIn the Port Mackay dialect[35] the latter numeral is compound, the count\r\nbeing _warpur_, 1, _boolera_, 2, _boolera warpur_, 3. For 4 the term is not\r\ngiven. In the dialect which prevailed between the Albert and Tweed\r\nrivers[36] the scale appears as _yaburu_, 1, _boolaroo_, 2, _boolaroo\r\nyaburu_, 3, and _gurul_ for 4 or anything beyond. The Wiraduroi[37] have\r\n_numbai_, 1, _bula_, 2, _bula numbai_, 3, _bungu_, 4, or many, and _bungu\r\ngalan_ or _bian galan_, 5, or very many. The Kamilaroi[38] scale is still\r\nmore irregular, compounding above 4 with little apparent method. The\r\nnumerals are _mal_, 1, _bular_, 2, _guliba_, 3, _bular bular_, 4, _bular\r\nguliba_, 5, _guliba guliba_, 6. The last two numerals show that 5 is to\r\nthese natives simply 2-3, and 6 is 3-3. For additional examples of a\r\nsimilar nature the extended list of Australian scales given in Chapter V.\r\nmay be consulted.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the Australian and Tasmanian tribes seem to have been\r\ndistinctly inferior to those of South America in their ability to use and\r\nto comprehend numerals. In all but two or three cases the Tasmanians[39]\r\nwere found to be unable to proceed beyond 2; and as the foregoing examples\r\nhave indicated, their Australian neighbours were but little better off. In\r\none or two instances we do find Australian numeral scales which reach 10,\r\nand perhaps we may safely say 20. One of these is given in full in a\r\nsubsequent chapter, and its structure gives rise to the suspicion that it\r\nwas originally as limited as those of kindred tribes, and that it underwent\r\na considerable development after the natives had come in contact with the\r\nEuropeans. There is good reason to believe that no Australian in his wild\r\nstate could ever count intelligently to 7.[40]\r\n\r\nIn certain portions of Asia, Africa, Melanesia, Polynesia, and North\r\nAmerica, are to be found races whose number systems are almost and\r\nsometimes quite as limited as are those of the South. American and\r\nAustralian tribes already cited, but nowhere else do we find these so\r\nabundant as in the two continents just mentioned, where example after\r\nexample might be cited of tribes whose ability to count is circumscribed\r\nwithin the narrowest limits. The Veddas[41] of Ceylon have but two\r\nnumerals, _ekkame[=i]_, 1, _dekkameï_, 2. Beyond this they count\r\n_otameekaï, otameekaï, otameekaï_, etc.; _i.e._ \"and one more, and one\r\nmore, and one more,\" and so on indefinitely. The Andamans,[42] inhabitants\r\nof a group of islands in the Bay of Bengal, are equally limited in their\r\npower of counting. They have _ubatulda_, 1, and _ikporda_, 2; but they can\r\ngo no further, except in a manner similar to that of the Veddas. Above two\r\nthey proceed wholly by means of the fingers, saying as they tap the nose\r\nwith each successive finger, _anka_, \"and this.\" Only the more intelligent\r\nof the Andamans can count at all, many of them seeming to be as nearly\r\ndestitute of the number sense as it is possible for a human being to be.\r\nThe Bushmen[43] of South Africa have but two numerals, the pronunciation of\r\nwhich can hardly be indicated without other resources than those of the\r\nEnglish alphabet. Their word for 3 means, simply, many, as in the case of\r\nsome of the Australian tribes. The Watchandies[44] have but two simple\r\nnumerals, and their entire number system is _cooteon_, 1, _utaura_, 2,\r\n_utarra cooteoo_, 3, _atarra utarra_, 4. Beyond this they can only say,\r\n_booltha_, many, and _booltha bat_, very many. Although they have the\r\nexpressions here given for 3 and 4, they are reluctant to use them, and\r\nonly do so when absolutely required. The natives of Lower California[45]\r\ncannot count above 5. A few of the more intelligent among them understand\r\nthe meaning of 2 fives, but this number seems entirely beyond the\r\ncomprehension of the ordinary native. The Comanches, curiously enough, are\r\nso reluctant to employ their number words that they appear to prefer finger\r\npantomime instead, thus giving rise to the impression which at one time\r\nbecame current, that they had no numerals at all for ordinary counting.\r\n\r\nAside from the specific examples already given, a considerable number of\r\nsweeping generalizations may be made, tending to show how rudimentary the\r\nnumber sense may be in aboriginal life. Scores of the native dialects of\r\nAustralia and South America have been found containing number systems but\r\nlittle more extensive than those alluded to above. The negro tribes of\r\nAfrica give the same testimony, as do many of the native races of Central\r\nAmerica, Mexico, and the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada, the\r\nnorthern part of Siberia, Greenland, Labrador, and the arctic archipelago.\r\nIn speaking of the Eskimos of Point Barrow, Murdoch[46] says: \"It was not\r\neasy to obtain any accurate information about the numeral system of these\r\npeople, since in ordinary conversation they are not in the habit of\r\nspecifying any numbers above five.\" Counting is often carried higher than\r\nthis among certain of these northern tribes, but, save for occasional\r\nexamples, it is limited at best. Dr. Franz Boas, who has travelled\r\nextensively among the Eskimos, and whose observations are always of the\r\nmost accurate nature, once told the author that he never met an Eskimo who\r\ncould count above 15. Their numerals actually do extend much higher; and a\r\nstray numeral of Danish origin is now and then met with, showing that the\r\nmore intelligent among them are able to comprehend numbers of much greater\r\nmagnitude than this. But as Dr. Boas was engaged in active work among them\r\nfor three years, we may conclude that the Eskimo has an arithmetic but\r\nlittle more extended than that which sufficed for the Australians and the\r\nforest tribes of Brazil. Early Russian explorers among the northern tribes\r\nof Siberia noticed the same difficulty in ordinary, every-day reckoning\r\namong the natives. At first thought we might, then, state it as a general\r\nlaw that those races which are lowest in the scale of civilization, have\r\nthe feeblest number sense also; or in other words, the least possible power\r\nof grasping the abstract idea of number.\r\n\r\nBut to this law there are many and important exceptions. The concurrent\r\ntestimony of explorers seems to be that savage races possess, in the great\r\nmajority of cases, the ability to count at least as high as 10. This limit\r\nis often extended to 20, and not infrequently to 100. Again, we find 1000\r\nas the limit; or perhaps 10,000; and sometimes the savage carries his\r\nnumber system on into the hundreds of thousands or millions. Indeed, the\r\nhigh limit to which some savage races carry their numeration is far more\r\nworthy of remark than the entire absence of the number sense exhibited by\r\nothers of apparently equal intelligence. If the life of any tribe is such\r\nas to induce trade and barter with their neighbours, a considerable\r\nquickness in reckoning will be developed among them. Otherwise this power\r\nwill remain dormant because there is but little in the ordinary life of\r\nprimitive man to call for its exercise.\r\n\r\nIn giving 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, or any other small number as a system limit, it\r\nmust not be overlooked that this limit mentioned is in all cases the limit\r\nof the spoken numerals at the savage's command. The actual ability to count\r\nis almost always, and one is tempted to say always, somewhat greater than\r\ntheir vocabularies would indicate. The Bushman has no number word that will\r\nexpress for him anything higher than 2; but with the assistance of his\r\nfingers he gropes his way on as far as 10. The Veddas, the Andamans, the\r\nGuachi, the Botocudos, the Eskimos, and the thousand and one other tribes\r\nwhich furnish such scanty numeral systems, almost all proceed with more or\r\nless readiness as far as their fingers will carry them. As a matter of\r\nfact, this limit is frequently extended to 20; the toes, the fingers of a\r\nsecond man, or a recount of the savage's own fingers, serving as a tale for\r\nthe second 10. Allusion is again made to this in a later chapter, where the\r\nsubject of counting on the fingers and toes is examined more in detail.\r\n\r\nIn saying that a savage can count to 10, to 20, or to 100, but little idea\r\nis given of his real mental conception of any except the smallest numbers.\r\nWant of familiarity with the use of numbers, and lack of convenient means\r\nof comparison, must result in extreme indefiniteness of mental conception\r\nand almost entire absence of exactness. The experience of Captain\r\nParry,[47] who found that the Eskimos made mistakes before they reached 7,\r\nand of Humboldt,[48] who says that a Chayma might be made to say that his\r\nage was either 18 or 60, has been duplicated by all investigators who have\r\nhad actual experience among savage races. Nor, on the other hand, is the\r\ndevelopment of a numeral system an infallible index of mental power, or of\r\nany real approach toward civilization. A continued use of the trading and\r\nbargaining faculties must and does result in a familiarity with numbers\r\nsufficient to enable savages to perform unexpected feats in reckoning.\r\nAmong some of the West African tribes this has actually been found to be\r\nthe case; and among the Yorubas of Abeokuta[49] the extraordinary saying,\r\n\"You may seem very clever, but you can't tell nine times nine,\" shows how\r\nsurprisingly this faculty has been developed, considering the general\r\ncondition of savagery in which the tribe lived. There can be no doubt that,\r\nin general, the growth of the number sense keeps pace with the growth of\r\nthe intelligence in other respects. But when it is remembered that the\r\nTonga Islanders have numerals up to 100,000, and the Tembus, the Fingoes,\r\nthe Pondos, and a dozen other South African tribes go as high as 1,000,000;\r\nand that Leigh Hunt never could learn the multiplication table, one must\r\nconfess that this law occasionally presents to our consideration remarkable\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nWhile considering the extent of the savage's arithmetical knowledge, of his\r\nability to count and to grasp the meaning of number, it may not be amiss to\r\nask ourselves the question, what is the extent of the development of our\r\nown number sense? To what limit can we absorb the idea of number, with a\r\ncomplete appreciation of the idea of the number of units involved in any\r\nwritten or spoken quantity? Our perfect system of numeration enables us to\r\nexpress without difficulty any desired number, no matter how great or how\r\nsmall it be. But how much of actually clear comprehension does the number\r\nthus expressed convey to the mind? We say that one place is 100 miles from\r\nanother; that A paid B 1000 dollars for a certain piece of property; that a\r\ngiven city contains 10,000 inhabitants; that 100,000 bushels of wheat were\r\nshipped from Duluth or Odessa on such a day; that 1,000,000 feet of lumber\r\nwere destroyed by the fire of yesterday,--and as we pass from the smallest\r\nto the largest of the numbers thus instanced, and from the largest on to\r\nthose still larger, we repeat the question just asked; and we repeat it\r\nwith a new sense of our own mental limitation. The number 100\r\nunquestionably stands for a distinct conception. Perhaps the same may be\r\nsaid for 1000, though this could not be postulated with equal certainty.\r\nBut what of 10,000? If that number of persons were gathered together into a\r\nsingle hall or amphitheatre, could an estimate be made by the average\r\nonlooker which would approximate with any degree of accuracy the size of\r\nthe assembly? Or if an observer were stationed at a certain point, and\r\n10,000 persons were to pass him in single file without his counting them as\r\nthey passed, what sort of an estimate would he make of their number? The\r\ntruth seems to be that our mental conception of number is much more limited\r\nthan is commonly thought, and that we unconsciously adopt some new unit as\r\na standard of comparison when we wish to render intelligible to our minds\r\nany number of considerable magnitude. For example, we say that A has a\r\nfortune of $1,000,000. The impression is at once conveyed of a considerable\r\ndegree of wealth, but it is rather from the fact that that fortune\r\nrepresents an annual income of $40,000 than, from the actual magnitude of\r\nthe fortune itself. The number 1,000,000 is, in itself, so greatly in\r\nexcess of anything that enters into our daily experience that we have but a\r\nvague conception of it, except as something very great. We are not, after\r\nall, so very much better off than the child who, with his arms about his\r\nmother's neck, informs her with perfect gravity and sincerity that he\r\n\"loves her a million bushels.\" His idea is merely of some very great\r\namount, and our own is often but little clearer when we use the expressions\r\nwhich are so easily represented by a few digits. Among the uneducated\r\nportions of civilized communities the limit of clear comprehension of\r\nnumber is not only relatively, but absolutely, very low. Travellers in\r\nRussia have informed the writer that the peasants of that country have no\r\ndistinct idea of a number consisting of but a few hundred even. There is no\r\nreason to doubt this testimony. The entire life of a peasant might be\r\npassed without his ever having occasion to use a number as great as 500,\r\nand as a result he might have respecting that number an idea less distinct\r\nthan a trained mathematician would have of the distance from the earth to\r\nthe sun. De Quincey[50] incidentally mentions this characteristic in\r\nnarrating a conversation which occurred while he was at Carnarvon, a little\r\ntown in Wales. \"It was on this occasion,\" he says, \"that I learned how\r\nvague are the ideas of number in unpractised minds. 'What number of people\r\ndo you think,' I said to an elderly person, 'will be assembled this day at\r\nCarnarvon?' 'What number?' rejoined the person addressed; 'what number?\r\nWell, really, now, I should reckon--perhaps a matter of four million.' Four\r\nmillions of _extra_ people in little Carnarvon, that could barely find\r\naccommodation (I should calculate) for an extra four hundred!\" So the\r\nEskimo and the South American Indian are, after all, not so very far behind\r\nthe \"elderly person\" of Carnarvon, in the distinct perception of a number\r\nwhich familiarity renders to us absurdly small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF NUMBER WORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the comparison of languages and the search for primitive root forms, no\r\nclass of expressions has been subjected to closer scrutiny than the little\r\ncluster of words, found in each language, which constitutes a part of the\r\ndaily vocabulary of almost every human being--the words with which we begin\r\nour counting. It is assumed, and with good reason, that these are among the\r\nearlier words to appear in any language; and in the mutations of human\r\nspeech, they are found to suffer less than almost any other portion of a\r\nlanguage. Kinship between tongues remote from each other has in many\r\ninstances been detected by the similarity found to exist among the\r\nevery-day words of each; and among these words one may look with a good\r\ndegree of certainty for the 1, 2, 3, etc., of the number scale. So fruitful\r\nhas been this line of research, that the attempt has been made, even, to\r\nestablish a common origin for all the races of mankind by means of a\r\ncomparison of numeral words.[51] But in this instance, as in so many others\r\nthat will readily occur to the mind, the result has been that the theory\r\nhas finally taken possession of the author and reduced him to complete\r\nsubjugation, instead of remaining his servant and submitting to the\r\nlegitimate results of patient and careful investigation. Linguistic\r\nresearch is so full of snares and pitfalls that the student must needs\r\nemploy the greatest degree of discrimination before asserting kinship of\r\nrace because of resemblances in vocabulary; or even relationship between\r\nwords in the same language because of some chance likeness of form that may\r\nexist between them. Probably no one would argue that the English and the\r\nBabusessé of Central Africa were of the same primitive stock simply because\r\nin the language of the latter _five atano_ means 5, and _ten kumi_ means\r\n10.[52] But, on the other hand, many will argue that, because the German\r\n_zehn_ means 10, and _zehen_ means toes, the ancestors of the Germans\r\ncounted on their toes; and that with them, 10 was the complete count of the\r\ntoes. It may be so. We certainly have no evidence with which to disprove\r\nthis; but, before accepting it as a fact, or even as a reasonable\r\nhypothesis, we may be pardoned for demanding some evidence aside from the\r\nmere resemblance in the form of the words. If, in the study of numeral\r\nwords, form is to constitute our chief guide, we must expect now and then\r\nto be confronted with facts which are not easily reconciled with any pet\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the present work will admit of no more than a hasty\r\nexamination of numeral forms, in which only actual and well ascertained\r\nmeanings will be considered. But here we are at the outset confronted with\r\na class of words whose original meanings appear to be entirely lost. They\r\nare what may be termed the numerals proper--the native, uncompounded words\r\nused to signify number. Such words are the one, two, three, etc., of\r\nEnglish; the eins, zwei, drei, etc., of German; words which must at some\r\ntime, in some prehistoric language, have had definite meanings entirely\r\napart from those which they now convey to our minds. In savage languages it\r\nis sometimes possible to detect these meanings, and thus to obtain\r\npossession of the clue that leads to the development, in the barbarian's\r\nrude mind, of a count scale--a number system. But in languages like those\r\nof modern Europe, the pedigree claimed by numerals is so long that, in the\r\nsuccessive changes through which they have passed, all trace of their\r\norigin seems to have been lost.\r\n\r\nThe actual number of such words is, however, surprisingly small in any\r\nlanguage. In English we count by simple words only to 10. From this point\r\nonward all our numerals except \"hundred\" and \"thousand\" are compounds and\r\ncombinations of the names of smaller numbers. The words we employ to\r\ndesignate the higher orders of units, as million, billion, trillion, etc.,\r\nare appropriated bodily from the Italian; and the native words _pair_,\r\n_tale_, _brace_, _dozen_, _gross_, and _score_, can hardly be classed as\r\nnumerals in the strict sense of the word. German possesses exactly the same\r\nnumber of native words in its numeral scale as English; and the same may be\r\nsaid of the Teutonic languages generally, as well as of the Celtic, the\r\nLatin, the Slavonic, and the Basque. This is, in fact, the universal method\r\nobserved in the formation of any numeral scale, though the actual number of\r\nsimple words may vary. The Chiquito language has but one numeral of any\r\nkind whatever; English contains twelve simple terms; Sanskrit has\r\ntwenty-seven, while Japanese possesses twenty-four, and the Chinese a\r\nnumber almost equally great. Very many languages, as might be expected,\r\ncontain special numeral expressions, such as the German _dutzend_ and the\r\nFrench _dizaine_; but these, like the English _dozen_ and _score_, are not\r\nto be regarded as numerals proper.\r\n\r\nThe formation of numeral words shows at a glance the general method in\r\nwhich any number scale has been built up. The primitive savage counts on\r\nhis fingers until he has reached the end of one, or more probably of both,\r\nhands. Then, if he wishes to proceed farther, some mark is made, a pebble\r\nis laid aside, a knot tied, or some similar device employed to signify that\r\nall the counters at his disposal have been used. Then the count begins\r\nanew, and to avoid multiplication of words, as well as to assist the\r\nmemory, the terms already used are again resorted to; and the name by which\r\nthe first halting-place was designated is repeated with each new numeral.\r\nHence the thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, etc., which are contractions of the\r\nfuller expressions three-and-ten, four-and-ten, five-and-ten, etc. The\r\nspecific method of combination may not always be the same, as witness the\r\n_eighteen_, or eight-ten, in English, and _dix-huit,_ or ten-eight, in\r\nFrench; _forty-five_, or four-tens-five, in English, and _fünf und\r\nvierzig_, or five and four tens in German. But the general method is the\r\nsame the world over, presenting us with nothing but local variations, which\r\nare, relatively speaking, entirely unimportant. With this fact in mind, we\r\ncan cease to wonder at the small number of simple numerals in any language.\r\nIt might, indeed, be queried, why do any languages, English and German, for\r\nexample, have unusual compounds for 11 and 12? It would seem as though the\r\nregular method of compounding should begin with 10 and 1, instead of 10 and\r\n3, in any language using a system with 10 as a base. An examination of\r\nseveral hundred numeral scales shows that the Teutonic languages are\r\nsomewhat exceptional in this respect. The words _eleven_ and _twelve_ are\r\nundoubtedly combinations, but not in the same direct sense as _thirteen_,\r\n_twenty-five_, etc. The same may be said of the French _onze_, _douze_,\r\n_treize_, _quatorze_, _quinze_, and _seize_, which are obvious compounds,\r\nbut not formed in the same manner as the numerals above that point. Almost\r\nall civilized languages, however, except the Teutonic, and practically all\r\nuncivilized languages, begin their direct numeral combinations as soon as\r\nthey have passed their number base, whatever that may be. To give an\r\nillustration, selected quite at random from among the barbarous tribes of\r\nAfrica, the Ki-Swahili numeral scale runs as follows:[53]\r\n\r\n   1.  moyyi,\r\n   2.  mbiri,\r\n   3.  tato,\r\n   4.  ena,\r\n   5.  tano,\r\n   6.  seta,\r\n   7.  saba,\r\n   8.  nani,\r\n   9.  kenda,\r\n  10.  kumi,\r\n  11.  kumi na moyyi,\r\n  12.  kumi na mbiri,\r\n  13.  kumi na tato,\r\n  etc.\r\n\r\nThe words for 11, 12, and 13, are seen at a glance to signify ten-and-one,\r\nten-and-two, ten-and-three, and the count proceeds, as might be inferred,\r\nin a similar manner as far as the number system extends. Our English\r\ncombinations are a little closer than these, and the combinations found in\r\ncertain other languages are, in turn, closer than those of the English; as\r\nwitness the _once_, 11, _doce_, 12, _trece_, 13, etc., of Spanish. But the\r\nprocess is essentially the same, and the law may be accepted as practically\r\ninvariable, that all numerals greater than the base of a system are\r\nexpressed by compound words, except such as are necessary to establish some\r\nnew order of unit, as hundred or thousand.\r\n\r\nIn the scale just given, it will be noticed that the larger number precedes\r\nthe smaller, giving 10 + 1, 10 + 2, etc., instead of 1 + 10, 2 + 10, etc.\r\nThis seems entirely natural, and hardly calls for any comment whatever. But\r\nwe have only to consider the formation of our English \"teens\" to see that\r\nour own method is, at its inception, just the reverse of this. Thirteen,\r\n14, and the remaining numerals up to 19 are formed by prefixing the smaller\r\nnumber to the base; and it is only when we pass 20 that we return to the\r\nmore direct and obvious method of giving precedence to the larger. In\r\nGerman and other Teutonic languages the inverse method is continued still\r\nfurther. Here 25 is _fünf und zwanzig_, 5 and 20; 92 is _zwei und neunzig_,\r\n2 and 90, and so on to 99. Above 100 the order is made direct, as in\r\nEnglish. Of course, this mode of formation between 20 and 100 is\r\npermissible in English, where \"five and twenty\" is just as correct a form\r\nas twenty-five. But it is archaic, and would soon pass out of the language\r\naltogether, were it not for the influence of some of the older writings\r\nwhich have had a strong influence in preserving for us many of older and\r\nmore essentially Saxon forms of expression.\r\n\r\nBoth the methods described above are found in all parts of the world, but\r\nwhat I have called the direct is far more common than the other. In\r\ngeneral, where the smaller number precedes the larger it signifies\r\nmultiplication instead of addition. Thus, when we say \"thirty,\" _i.e._\r\nthree-ten, we mean 3 × 10; just as \"three hundred\" means 3 × 100. When the\r\nlarger precedes the smaller, we must usually understand addition. But to\r\nboth these rules there are very many exceptions. Among higher numbers the\r\ninverse order is very rarely used; though even here an occasional exception\r\nis found. The Taensa Indians, for example, place the smaller numbers before\r\nthe larger, no matter how far their scale may extend. To say 1881 they make\r\na complete inversion of our own order, beginning with 1 and ending with\r\n1000. Their full numeral for this is _yeha av wabki mar-u-wab mar-u-haki_,\r\nwhich means, literally, 1 + 80 + 100 × 8 + 100 × 10.[54] Such exceptions\r\nare, however, quite rare.\r\n\r\nOne other method of combination, that of subtraction, remains to be\r\nconsidered. Every student of Latin will recall at once the _duodeviginti_,\r\n2 from 20, and _undeviginti_, 1 from 20, which in that language are the\r\nregular forms of expression for 18 and 19. At first they seem decidedly\r\nodd; but familiarity soon accustoms one to them, and they cease entirely to\r\nattract any special attention. This principle of subtraction, which, in the\r\nformation of numeral words, is quite foreign to the genius of English, is\r\nstill of such common occurrence in other languages that the Latin examples\r\njust given cease to be solitary instances.\r\n\r\nThe origin of numerals of this class is to be found in the idea of\r\nreference, not necessarily to the last, but to the nearest, halting-point\r\nin the scale. Many tribes seem to regard 9 as \"almost 10,\" and to give it a\r\nname which conveys this thought. In the Mississaga, one of the numerous\r\nAlgonquin languages, we have, for example, the word _cangaswi_, \"incomplete\r\n10,\" for 9.[55] In the Kwakiutl of British Columbia, 8 as well as 9 is\r\nformed in this way; these two numbers being _matlguanatl_, 10 - 2, and\r\n_nanema_, 10 - 1, respectively.[56] In many of the languages of British\r\nColumbia we find a similar formation for 8 and 9, or for 9 alone. The same\r\nformation occurs in Malay, resulting in the numerals _delapan_, 10 - 2, and\r\n_sambilan_ 10 - 1.[57] In Green Island, one of the New Ireland group, these\r\nbecome simply _andra-lua_, \"less 2,\" and _andra-si_, \"less 1.\"[58] In the\r\nAdmiralty Islands this formation is carried back one step further, and not\r\nonly gives us _shua-luea_, \"less 2,\" and _shu-ri_, \"less 1,\" but also makes\r\n7 appear as _sua-tolu_, \"less 3.\"[59] Surprising as this numeral is, it is\r\nmore than matched by the Ainu scale, which carries subtraction back still\r\nanother step, and calls 6, 10 - 4. The four numerals from 6 to 9 in this\r\nscale are respectively, _iwa_, 10 - 4, _arawa_, 10 - 3, _tupe-san_, 10 - 2,\r\nand _sinepe-san_, 10 - 1.[60] Numerous examples of this kind of formation\r\nwill be found in later chapters of this work; but they will usually be\r\nfound to occur in one or both of the numerals, 8 and 9. Occasionally they\r\nappear among the higher numbers; as in the Maya languages, where, for\r\nexample, 99 years is \"one single year lacking from five score years,\"[61]\r\nand in the Arikara dialects, where 98 and 99 are \"5 men minus\" and \"5 men 1\r\nnot.\"[62] The Welsh, Danish, and other languages less easily accessible\r\nthan these to the general student, also furnish interesting examples of a\r\nsimilar character.\r\n\r\nMore rarely yet are instances met with of languages which make use of\r\nsubtraction almost as freely as addition, in the composition of numerals.\r\nWithin the past few years such an instance has been noticed in the case of\r\nthe Bellacoola language of British Columbia. In their numeral scale 15,\r\n\"one foot,\" is followed by 16, \"one man less 4\"; 17, \"one man less 3\"; 18,\r\n\"one man less 2\"; 19, \"one man less 1\"; and 20, one man. Twenty-five is\r\n\"one man and one hand\"; 26, \"one man and two hands less 4\"; 36, \"two men\r\nless 4\"; and so on. This method of formation prevails throughout the entire\r\nnumeral scale.[63]\r\n\r\nOne of the best known and most interesting examples of subtraction as\r\na well-defined principle of formation is found in the Maya scale. Up\r\nto 40 no special peculiarity appears; but as the count progresses beyond\r\nthat point we find a succession of numerals which one is almost tempted\r\nto call 60 - 19, 60 - 18, 60 - 17, etc. Literally translated the meanings\r\nseem to be 1 to 60, 2 to 60, 3 to 60, etc. The point of reference is 60,\r\nand the thought underlying the words may probably be expressed by the\r\nparaphrases, \"1 on the third score, 2 on the third score, 3 on the third\r\nscore,\" etc.  Similarly, 61 is 1 on the fourth score, 81 is one on the\r\nfifth score, 381 is 1 on the nineteenth score, and so on to 400. At 441\r\nthe same formation reappears; and it continues to characterize the system\r\nin a regular and consistent manner, no matter how far it is extended.[64]\r\n\r\nThe Yoruba language of Africa is another example of most lavish use of\r\nsubtraction; but it here results in a system much less consistent and\r\nnatural than that just considered. Here we find not only 5, 10, and 20\r\nsubtracted from the next higher unit, but also 40, and even 100. For\r\nexample, 360 is 400 - 40; 460 is 500 - 40; 500 is 600 - 100; 1300 is\r\n1400 - 100, etc. One of the Yoruba units is 200; and all the odd hundreds\r\nup to 2000, the next higher unit, are formed by subtracting 100 from the\r\nnext higher multiple of 200. The system is quite complex, and very\r\nartificial; and seems to have been developed by intercourse with\r\ntraders.[65]\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the primitive meanings of our own simple\r\nnumerals have been lost. This is also true of the languages of nearly all\r\nother civilized peoples, and of numerous savage races as well. We are at\r\nliberty to suppose, and we do suppose, that in very many cases these words\r\nonce expressed meanings closely connected with the names of the fingers, or\r\nwith the fingers themselves, or both. Now and then a case is met with in\r\nwhich the numeral word frankly avows its meaning--as in the Botocudo\r\nlanguage, where 1 is expressed by _podzik_, finger, and 2 by _kripo_,\r\ndouble finger;[66] and in the Eskimo dialect of Hudson's Bay, where\r\n_eerkitkoka_ means both 10 and little finger.[67] Such cases are, however,\r\nsomewhat exceptional.\r\n\r\nIn a few noteworthy instances, the words composing the numeral scale of a\r\nlanguage have been carefully investigated and their original meanings\r\naccurately determined. The simple structure of many of the rude languages\r\nof the world should render this possible in a multitude of cases; but\r\ninvestigators are too often content with the mere numerals themselves, and\r\nmake no inquiry respecting their meanings. But the following exposition of\r\nthe Zuñi scale, given by Lieutenant Gushing[68] leaves nothing to be\r\ndesired:\r\n\r\n   1.  töpinte = taken to start with.\r\n   2.  kwilli  = put down together with.\r\n   3.  ha'[=i] = the equally dividing finger.\r\n   4.  awite   = all the fingers all but done with.\r\n   5.  öpte    = the notched off.\r\n\r\nThis finishes the list of original simple numerals, the Zuñi stopping, or\r\n\"notching off,\" when he finishes the fingers of one hand. Compounding now\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n   6.  topalïk'ya   = another brought to add to the done with.\r\n   7.  kwillilïk'ya = two brought to and held up with the rest.\r\n   8.  hailïk'ye    = three brought to and held up with the rest.\r\n   9.  tenalïk'ya   = all but all are held up with the rest.\r\n  10.  ästem'thila  = all the fingers.\r\n  11.  ästem'thla topayä'thl'tona = all the fingers and another over\r\n                                    above held.\r\n\r\nThe process of formation indicated in 11 is used in the succeeding numerals\r\nup to 19.\r\n\r\n    20.  kwillik'yënästem'thlan = two times all the fingers.\r\n   100.  ässiästem'thlak'ya = the fingers all the fingers.\r\n  1000.  ässiästem'thlanak'yënästem'thla = the fingers all the fingers\r\n                                           times all the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe only numerals calling for any special note are those for 11 and 9. For\r\n9 we should naturally expect a word corresponding in structure and meaning\r\nto the words for 7 and 8. But instead of the \"four brought to and held up\r\nwith the rest,\" for which we naturally look, the Zuñi, to show that he has\r\nused all of his fingers but one, says \"all but all are held up with the\r\nrest.\" To express 11 he cannot use a similar form of composition, since he\r\nhas already used it in constructing his word for 6, so he says \"all the\r\nfingers and another over above held.\"\r\n\r\nThe one remarkable point to be noted about the Zuñi scale is, after all,\r\nthe formation of the words for 1 and 2. While the savage almost always\r\ncounts on his fingers, it does not seem at all certain that these words\r\nwould necessarily be of finger formation. The savage can always distinguish\r\nbetween one object and two objects, and it is hardly reasonable to believe\r\nthat any external aid is needed to arrive at a distinct perception of this\r\ndifference. The numerals for 1 and 2 would be the earliest to be formed in\r\nany language, and in most, if not all, cases they would be formed long\r\nbefore the need would be felt for terms to describe any higher number. If\r\nthis theory be correct, we should expect to find finger names for numerals\r\nbeginning not lower than 3, and oftener with 5 than with any other number.\r\nThe highest authority has ventured the assertion that all numeral words\r\nhave their origin in the names of the fingers;[69] substantially the same\r\nconclusion was reached by Professor Pott, of Halle, whose work on numeral\r\nnomenclature led him deeply into the study of the origin of these words.\r\nBut we have abundant evidence at hand to show that, universal as finger\r\ncounting has been, finger origin for numeral words has by no means been\r\nuniversal. That it is more frequently met with than any other origin is\r\nunquestionably true; but in many instances, which will be more fully\r\nconsidered in the following chapter, we find strictly non-digital\r\nderivations, especially in the case of the lowest members of the scale. But\r\nin nearly all languages the origin of the words for 1, 2, 3, and 4 are so\r\nentirely unknown that speculation respecting them is almost useless.\r\n\r\nAn excellent illustration of the ordinary method of formation which obtains\r\namong number scales is furnished by the Eskimos of Point Barrow,[70] who\r\nhave pure numeral words up to 5, and then begin a systematic course of word\r\nformation from the names of their fingers. If the names of the first five\r\nnumerals are of finger origin, they have so completely lost their original\r\nform, or else the names of the fingers themselves have so changed, that no\r\nresemblance is now to be detected between them. This scale is so\r\ninteresting that it is given with considerable fulness, as follows:\r\n\r\n   1.  atauzik.\r\n   2.  madro.\r\n   3.  pinasun.\r\n   4.  sisaman.\r\n   5.  tudlemut.\r\n   6.  atautyimin akbinigin [tudlimu(t)] = 5 and 1 on the next.\r\n   7.  madronin akbinigin  = twice on the next.\r\n   8.  pinasunin akbinigin = three times on the next.\r\n   9.  kodlinotaila        = that which has not its 10.\r\n  10.  kodlin              = the upper part--_i.e._ the fingers.\r\n  14.  akimiaxotaityuna    = I have not 15.\r\n  15.  akimia. [This seems to be a real numeral word.]\r\n  20.  inyuina = a man come to an end.\r\n  25.  inyuina tudlimunin akbinidigin = a man come to an end and 5 on the\r\n                                        next.\r\n  30.  inyuina kodlinin akbinidigin = a man come to an end and 10 on the\r\n                                      next.\r\n  35.  inyuina akimiamin aipalin = a man come to an end accompanied by 1\r\n                                   fifteen times.\r\n  40.  madro inyuina = 2 men come to an end.\r\n\r\nIn this scale we find the finger origin appearing so clearly and so\r\nrepeatedly that one feels some degree of surprise at finding 5 expressed by\r\na pure numeral instead of by some word meaning _hand_ or _fingers of one\r\nhand_. In this respect the Eskimo dialects are somewhat exceptional among\r\nscales built up of digital words. The system of the Greenland Eskimos,\r\nthough differing slightly from that of their Point Barrow cousins, shows\r\nthe same peculiarity. The first ten numerals of this scale are:[71]\r\n\r\n   1.  atausek.\r\n   2.  mardluk.\r\n   3.  pingasut.\r\n   4.  sisamat.\r\n   5.  tatdlimat.\r\n   6.  arfinek-atausek  = to the other hand 1.\r\n   7.  arfinek-mardluk  = to the other hand 2.\r\n   8.  arfinek-pingasut = to the other hand 3.\r\n   9.  arfinek-sisamat  = to the other hand 4.\r\n  10.  kulit.\r\n\r\nThe same process is now repeated, only the feet instead of the hands are\r\nused; and the completion of the second 10 is marked by the word _innuk_,\r\nman. It may be that the Eskimo word for 5 is, originally, a digital word,\r\nbut if so, the fact has not yet been detected. From the analogy furnished\r\nby other languages we are justified in suspecting that this may be the\r\ncase; for whenever a number system contains digital words, we expect them\r\nto begin with _five_, as, for example, in the Arawak scale,[72] which runs:\r\n\r\n   1.  abba.\r\n   2.  biama.\r\n   3.  kabbuhin.\r\n   4.  bibiti.\r\n   5.  abbatekkábe = 1 hand.\r\n   6.  abbatiman   = 1 of the other.\r\n   7.  biamattiman = 2 of the other.\r\n   8.  kabbuhintiman = 3 of the other.\r\n   9.  bibitiman     = 4 of the other.\r\n  10.  biamantekábbe = 2 hands.\r\n  11.  abba kutihibena = 1 from the feet.\r\n  20.  abba lukku = hands feet.\r\n\r\nThe four sets of numerals just given may be regarded as typifying one of\r\nthe most common forms of primitive counting; and the words they contain\r\nserve as illustrations of the means which go to make up the number scales\r\nof savage races. Frequently the finger and toe origin of numerals is\r\nperfectly apparent, as in the Arawak system just given, which exhibits the\r\nsimplest and clearest possible method of formation. Another even more\r\ninteresting system is that of the Montagnais of northern Canada.[73] Here,\r\nas in the Zuñi scale, the words are digital from the outset.\r\n\r\n   1.  inl'are = the end is bent.\r\n   2.  nak'e   = another is bent.\r\n   3.  t'are   = the middle is bent.\r\n   4.  dinri   = there are no more except this.\r\n   5.  se-sunla-re = the row on the hand.\r\n   6.  elkke-t'are = 3 from each side.\r\n   7.{ t'a-ye-oyertan = there are still 3 of them.\r\n     { inl'as dinri   = on one side there are 4 of them.\r\n   8.  elkke-dinri    = 4 on each side.\r\n   9.  inl'a-ye-oyert'an = there is still 1 more.\r\n  10.  onernan = finished on each side.\r\n  11.  onernan inl'are ttcharidhel = 1 complete and 1.\r\n  12.  onernan nak'e ttcharidhel = 1 complete and 2, etc.\r\n\r\nThe formation of 6, 7, and 8 of this scale is somewhat different from that\r\nordinarily found. To express 6, the Montagnais separates the thumb and\r\nforefinger from the three remaining fingers of the left hand, and bringing\r\nthe thumb of the right hand close to them, says: \"3 from each side.\" For 7\r\nhe either subtracts from 10, saying: \"there are still 3 of them,\" or he\r\nbrings the thumb and forefinger of the right hand up to the thumb of the\r\nleft, and says: \"on one side there are 4 of them.\" He calls 8 by the same\r\nname as many of the other Canadian tribes, that is, two 4's; and to show\r\nthe proper number of fingers, he closes the thumb and little finger of the\r\nright hand, and then puts the three remaining fingers beside the thumb of\r\nthe left hand. This method is, in some of these particulars, different from\r\nany other I have ever examined.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that the composition of numeral words is less easily\r\nunderstood, and the original meanings more difficult to recover, than in\r\nthe examples already given. But in searching for number systems which show\r\nin the formation of their words the influence of finger counting, it is not\r\nunusual to find those in which the derivation from native words signifying\r\n_finger, hand, toe, foot_, and _man_, is just as frankly obvious as in the\r\ncase of the Zuñi, the Arawak, the Eskimo, or the Montagnais scale. Among\r\nthe Tamanacs,[74] one of the numerous Indian tribes of the Orinoco, the\r\nnumerals are as strictly digital as in any of the systems already examined.\r\nThe general structure of the Tamanac scale is shown by the following\r\nnumerals:\r\n\r\n   5.  amgnaitone = 1 hand complete.\r\n   6.  itacono amgna pona tevinitpe = 1 on the other hand.\r\n  10.  amgna aceponare = all of the 2 hands.\r\n  11.  puitta pona tevinitpe = 1 on the foot.\r\n  16.  itacono puitta pona tevinitpe = 1 on the other foot.\r\n  20.  tevin itoto = 1 man.\r\n  21.  itacono itoto jamgnar bona tevinitpe = 1 on the hands of another\r\n                                              man.\r\n\r\nIn the Guarani[75] language of Paraguay the same method is found, with a\r\ndifferent form of expression for 20. Here the numerals in question are\r\n\r\n   5.  asepopetei = one hand.\r\n  10.  asepomokoi = two hands.\r\n  20.  asepo asepi abe = hands and feet.\r\n\r\nAnother slight variation is furnished by the Kiriri language,[76] which is\r\nalso one of the numerous South American Indian forms of speech, where we\r\nfind the words to be\r\n\r\n   5.  mi biche misa    = one hand.\r\n  10.  mikriba misa sai = both hands.\r\n  20.  mikriba misa idecho ibi sai = both hands together with the feet.\r\n\r\nIllustrations of this kind might be multiplied almost indefinitely; and it\r\nis well to note that they may be drawn from all parts of the world. South\r\nAmerica is peculiarly rich in native numeral words of this kind; and, as\r\nthe examples above cited show, it is the field to which one instinctively\r\nturns when this subject is under discussion. The Zamuco numerals are, among\r\nothers, exceedingly interesting, giving us still a new variation in method.\r\nThey are[77]\r\n\r\n   1.  tsomara.\r\n   2.  gar.\r\n   3.  gadiok.\r\n   4.  gahagani.\r\n   5.  tsuena yimana-ite = ended 1 hand.\r\n   6.  tsomara-hi  = 1 on the other.\r\n   7.  gari-hi     = 2 on the other.\r\n   8.  gadiog-ihi  = 3 on the other.\r\n   9.  gahagani-hi = 4 on the other.\r\n  10.  tsuena yimana-die = ended both hands.\r\n  11.  tsomara yiri-tie  = 1 on the foot.\r\n  12.  gar yiritie       = 2 on the foot.\r\n  20.  tsuena yiri-die   = ended both feet.\r\n\r\nAs is here indicated, the form of progression from 5 to 10, which we should\r\nexpect to be \"hand-1,\" or \"hand-and-1,\" or some kindred expression,\r\nsignifying that one hand had been completed, is simply \"1 on the other.\"\r\nAgain, the expressions for 11, 12, etc., are merely \"1 on the foot,\" \"2 on\r\nthe foot,\" etc., while 20 is \"both feet ended.\"\r\n\r\nAn equally interesting scale is furnished by the language of the\r\nMaipures[78] of the Orinoco, who count\r\n\r\n   1.  papita.\r\n   2.  avanume.\r\n   3.  apekiva.\r\n   4.  apekipaki.\r\n   5.  papitaerri capiti = 1 only hand.\r\n   6.  papita yana pauria capiti purena = 1 of the other hand we take.\r\n  10.  apanumerri capiti = 2 hands.\r\n  11.  papita yana kiti purena = 1 of the toes we take.\r\n  20.  papita camonee  = 1 man.\r\n  40.  avanume camonee = 2 men.\r\n  60.  apekiva camonee = 3 men, etc.\r\n\r\nIn all the examples thus far given, 20 is expressed either by the\r\nequivalent of \"man\" or by some formula introducing the word \"feet.\" Both\r\nthese modes of expressing what our own ancestors termed a \"score,\" are so\r\ncommon that one hesitates to say which is of the more frequent use. The\r\nfollowing scale, from one of the Betoya dialects[79] of South America, is\r\nquite remarkable among digital scales, making no use of either \"man\" or\r\n\"foot,\" but reckoning solely by fives, or hands, as the numerals indicate.\r\n\r\n   1.  tey.\r\n   2.  cayapa.\r\n   3.  toazumba.\r\n   4.  cajezea    = 2 with plural termination.\r\n   5.  teente     = hand.\r\n   6.  teyentetey = hand + 1.\r\n   7.  teyente cayapa    = hand + 2.\r\n   8.  teyente toazumba  = hand + 3.\r\n   9.  teyente caesea    = hand + 4.\r\n  10.  caya ente, or caya huena = 2 hands.\r\n  11.  caya ente-tey     = 2 hands + 1.\r\n  15.  toazumba-ente     = 3 hands.\r\n  16.  toazumba-ente-tey = 3 hands + 1.\r\n  20.  caesea ente       = 4 hands.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter mention was made of the scanty numeral systems of the\r\nAustralian tribes, but a single scale was alluded to as reaching the\r\ncomparatively high limit of 20. This system is that belonging to the\r\nPikumbuls,[80] and the count runs thus:\r\n\r\n   1.  mal.\r\n   2.  bular.\r\n   3.  guliba.\r\n   4.  bularbular = 2-2.\r\n   5.  mulanbu.\r\n   6.  malmulanbu mummi        = 1 and 5 added on.\r\n   7.  bularmulanbu mummi      = 2 and 5 added on.\r\n   8.  gulibamulanbu mummi     = 3 and 5 added on.\r\n   9.  bularbularmulanbu mummi = 4 and 5 added on.\r\n  10.  bularin murra      = belonging to the 2 hands.\r\n  11.  maldinna mummi     = 1 of the toes added on (to the 10 fingers).\r\n  12.  bular dinna mummi  = 2 of the toes added on.\r\n  13.  guliba dinna mummi = 3 of the toes added on.\r\n  14.  bular bular dinna mummi = 4 of the toes added on.\r\n  15.  mulanba dinna = 5 of the toes added on.\r\n  16.  mal dinna mulanbu    = 1 and 5 toes.\r\n  17.  bular dinna mulanbu  = 2 and 5 toes.\r\n  18.  guliba dinna mulanbu = 3 and 5 toes.\r\n  19.  bular bular dinna mulanbu = 4 and 5 toes.\r\n  20.  bularin dinna = belonging to the 2 feet.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, there is good ground for believing that this\r\nsystem was originally as limited as those obtained from other Australian\r\ntribes, and that its extension from 4, or perhaps from 5 onward, is of\r\ncomparatively recent date.\r\n\r\nA somewhat peculiar numeral nomenclature is found in the language of the\r\nKlamath Indians of Oregon. The first ten words in the Klamath scale\r\nare:[81]\r\n\r\n   1.  nash, or nas.\r\n   2.  lap   = hand.\r\n   3.  ndan.\r\n   4.  vunep = hand up.\r\n   5.  tunep = hand away.\r\n   6.  nadshkshapta = 1 I have bent over.\r\n   7.  lapkshapta   = 2 I have bent over.\r\n   8.  ndankshapta  = 3 I have bent over.\r\n   9.  nadshskeksh  = 1 left over.\r\n  10.  taunep       = hand hand?\r\n\r\nIn describing this system Mr. Gatschet says: \"If the origin of the Klamath\r\nnumerals is thus correctly traced, their inventors must have counted only\r\nthe four long fingers without the thumb, and 5 was counted while saying\r\n_hand away! hand off!_ The 'four,' or _hand high! hand up!_ intimates that\r\nthe hand was held up high after counting its four digits; and some term\r\nexpressing this gesture was, in the case of _nine_, substituted by 'one\r\nleft over' ... which means to say, 'only one is left until all the fingers\r\nare counted.'\" It will be observed that the Klamath introduces not only the\r\nordinary finger manipulation, but a gesture of the entire hand as well. It\r\nis a common thing to find something of the kind to indicate the completion\r\nof 5 or 10, and in one or two instances it has already been alluded to.\r\nSometimes one or both of the closed fists are held up; sometimes the open\r\nhand, with all the fingers extended, is used; and sometimes an entirely\r\nindependent gesture is introduced. These are, in general, of no special\r\nimportance; but one custom in vogue among some of the prairie tribes of\r\nIndians, to which my attention was called by Dr. J. Owen Dorsey,[82] should\r\nbe mentioned. It is a gesture which signifies multiplication, and is\r\nperformed by throwing the hand to the left. Thus, after counting 5, a wave\r\nof the hand to the left means 50. As multiplication is rather unusual among\r\nsavage tribes, this is noteworthy, and would seem to indicate on the part\r\nof the Indian a higher degree of intelligence than is ordinarily possessed\r\nby uncivilized races.\r\n\r\nIn the numeral scale as we possess it in English, we find it necessary to\r\nretain the name of the last unit of each kind used, in order to describe\r\ndefinitely any numeral employed. Thus, fifteen, one hundred forty-two, six\r\nthousand seven hundred twenty-seven, give in full detail the numbers they\r\nare intended to describe. In primitive scales this is not always considered\r\nnecessary; thus, the Zamucos express their teens without using their word\r\nfor 10 at all. They say simply, 1 on the foot, 2 on the foot, etc.\r\nCorresponding abbreviations are often met; so often, indeed, that no\r\nfurther mention of them is needed. They mark one extreme, the extreme of\r\nbrevity, found in the savage method of building up hand, foot, and finger\r\nnames for numerals; while the Zuñi scale marks the extreme of prolixity in\r\nthe formation of such words. A somewhat ruder composition than any yet\r\nnoticed is shown in the numerals of the Vilelo scale,[83] which are:\r\n\r\n   1.  agit, or yaagit.\r\n   2.  uke.\r\n   3.  nipetuei.\r\n   4.  yepkatalet.\r\n   5.  isig-nisle-yaagit    = hand fingers 1.\r\n   6.  isig-teet-yaagit     = hand with 1.\r\n   7.  isig-teet-uke        = hand with 2.\r\n   8.  isig-teet-nipetuei   = hand with 3.\r\n   9.  isig-teet-yepkatalet = hand with 4.\r\n  10.  isig-uke-nisle = second hand fingers (lit. hand-two-fingers).\r\n  11.  isig-uke-nisle-teet-yaagit = second hand fingers with 1.\r\n  20.  isig-ape-nisle-lauel = hand foot fingers all.\r\n\r\nIn the examples thus far given, it will be noticed that the actual names of\r\nindividual fingers do not appear. In general, such words as thumb,\r\nforefinger, little finger, are not found, but rather the hand-1, 1 on the\r\nnext, or 1 over and above, which we have already seen, are the type forms\r\nfor which we are to look. Individual finger names do occur, however, as in\r\nthe scale of the Hudson's Bay Eskimos,[84] where the three following words\r\nare used both as numerals and as finger names:\r\n\r\n   8.  kittukleemoot   = middle finger.\r\n   9.  mikkeelukkamoot = fourth finger.\r\n  10.  eerkitkoka      = little finger.\r\n\r\nWords of similar origin are found in the original Jiviro scale,[85] where\r\nthe native numerals are:\r\n\r\n   1.  ala.\r\n   2.  catu.\r\n   3.  cala.\r\n   4.  encatu.\r\n   5.  alacötegladu = 1 hand.\r\n   6.  intimutu     = thumb (of second hand).\r\n   7.  tannituna    = index finger.\r\n   8.  tannituna cabiasu = the finger next the index finger.\r\n   9.  bitin ötegla cabiasu = hand next to complete.\r\n  10.  catögladu    = 2 hands.\r\n\r\nAs if to emphasize the rarity of this method of forming numerals, the\r\nJiviros afterward discarded the last five of the above scale, replacing\r\nthem by words borrowed from the Quichuas, or ancient Peruvians. The same\r\nprocess may have been followed by other tribes, and in this way numerals\r\nwhich were originally digital may have disappeared. But we have no evidence\r\nthat this has ever happened in any extensive manner. We are, rather,\r\nimpelled to accept the occasional numerals of this class as exceptions to\r\nthe general rule, until we have at our disposal further evidence of an\r\nexact and critical nature, which would cause us to modify this opinion. An\r\nelaborate philological study by Dr. J.H. Trumbull[86] of the numerals used\r\nby many of the North American Indian tribes reveals the presence in the\r\nlanguages of these tribes of a few, but only a few, finger names which are\r\nused without change as numeral expressions also. Sometimes the finger gives\r\na name not its own to the numeral with which it is associated in\r\ncounting--as in the Chippeway dialect, which has _nawi-nindj_, middle of\r\nthe hand, and _nisswi_, 3; and the Cheyenne, where _notoyos_, middle\r\nfinger, and _na-nohhtu_, 8, are closely related. In other parts of the\r\nworld isolated examples of the transference of finger names to numerals are\r\nalso found. Of these a well-known example is furnished by the Zulu\r\nnumerals, where \"_tatisitupa_, taking the thumb, becomes a numeral for six.\r\nThen the verb _komba_, to point, indicating the forefinger, or 'pointer,'\r\nmakes the next numeral, seven. Thus, answering the question, 'How much did\r\nyour master give you?' a Zulu would say, '_U kombile_,' 'He pointed with\r\nhis forefinger,' _i.e._ 'He gave me seven'; and this curious way of using\r\nthe numeral verb is also shown in such an example as '_amahasi akombile_,'\r\n'the horses have pointed,' _i.e._ 'there were seven of them.' In like\r\nmanner, _Kijangalobili_, 'keep back two fingers,' _i.e._ eight, and\r\n_Kijangalolunje_, 'keep back one finger,' _i.e._ nine, lead on to _kumi_,\r\nten.\"[87]\r\n\r\nReturning for a moment to the consideration of number systems in the\r\nformation of which the influence of the hand has been paramount, we find\r\nstill further variations of the method already noticed of constructing\r\nnames for the fives, tens, and twenties, as well as for the intermediate\r\nnumbers. Instead of the simple words \"hand,\" \"foot,\" etc., we not\r\ninfrequently meet with some paraphrase for one or for all these terms, the\r\nderivation of which is unmistakable. The Nengones,[88] an island tribe of\r\nthe Indian Ocean, though using the word \"man\" for 20, do not employ\r\nexplicit hand or foot words, but count\r\n\r\n   1.  sa.\r\n   2.  rewe.\r\n   3.  tini.\r\n   4.  etse.\r\n   5.  se dono       = the end (of the first hand).\r\n   6.  dono ne sa    = end and 1.\r\n   7.  dono ne rewe  = end and 2.\r\n   8.  dono ne tini  = end and 3.\r\n   9.  dono ne etse  = end and 4.\r\n  10.  rewe tubenine = 2 series (of fingers).\r\n  11.  rewe tubenine ne sa re tsemene = 2 series and 1 on the next?\r\n  20.  sa re nome    = 1 man.\r\n  30.  sa re nome ne rewe tubenine = 1 man and 2 series.\r\n  40.  rewe ne nome  = 2 men.\r\n\r\nExamples like the above are not infrequent. The Aztecs used for 10 the word\r\n_matlactli_, hand-half, _i.e._ the hand half of a man, and for 20\r\n_cempoalli_, one counting.[89] The Point Barrow Eskimos call 10 _kodlin_,\r\nthe upper part, _i.e._ of a man. One of the Ewe dialects of Western\r\nAfrica[90] has _ewo_, done, for 10; while, curiously enough, 9, _asieke_,\r\nis a digital word, meaning \"to part (from) the hand.\"\r\n\r\nIn numerous instances also some characteristic word not of hand derivation\r\nis found, like the Yoruba _ogodzi_, string, which becomes a numeral for 40,\r\nbecause 40 cowries made a \"string\"; and the Maori _tekau_, bunch, which\r\nsignifies 10. The origin of this seems to have been the custom of counting\r\nyams and fish by \"bunches\" of ten each.[91]\r\n\r\nAnother method of forming numeral words above 5 or 10 is found in the\r\npresence of such expressions as second 1, second 2, etc. In languages of\r\nrude construction and incomplete development the simple numeral scale is\r\noften found to end with 5, and all succeeding numerals to be formed from\r\nthe first 5. The progression from that point may be 5-1, 5-2, etc., as in\r\nthe numerous quinary scales to be noticed later, or it may be second 1,\r\nsecond 2, etc., as in the Niam Niam dialect of Central Africa, where the\r\nscale is[92]\r\n\r\n   1.  sa.\r\n   2.  uwi.\r\n   3.  biata.\r\n   4.  biama.\r\n   5.  biswi.\r\n   6.  batissa = 2d 1.\r\n   7.  batiwwi = 2d 2.\r\n   8.  batti-biata = 2d 3.\r\n   9.  batti-biama = 2d 4.\r\n  10.  bauwé   = 2d 5.\r\n\r\nThat this method of progression is not confined to the least developed\r\nlanguages, however, is shown by a most cursory examination of the numerals\r\nof our American Indian tribes, where numeral formation like that exhibited\r\nabove is exceedingly common. In the Kootenay dialect,[93] of British\r\nColumbia, _qaetsa_, 4, and _wo-qaetsa,_ 8, are obviously related, the\r\nlatter word probably meaning a second 4. Most of the native languages of\r\nBritish Columbia form their words for 7 and 8 from those which signify 2\r\nand 3; as, for example, the Heiltsuk,[94] which shows in the following\r\nwords a most obvious correspondence:\r\n\r\n   2.  matl.       7.  matlaaus.\r\n   3.  yutq.       8.  yutquaus.\r\n\r\nIn the Choctaw language[95] the relation between 2 and 7, and 3 and 8, is\r\nno less clear. Here the words are:\r\n\r\n   2.  tuklo.      7.  untuklo.\r\n   3.  tuchina.    8.  untuchina.\r\n\r\nThe Nez Percés[96] repeat the first three words of their scale in their 6,\r\n7, and 8 respectively, as a comparison of these numerals will show.\r\n\r\n   1.  naks.       6.  oilaks.\r\n   2.  lapit.      7.  oinapt.\r\n   3.  mitat.      8.  oimatat.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases the essential point of the method is contained in the\r\nrepetition, in one way or another, of the numerals of the second quinate,\r\nwithout the use with each one of the word for 5. This may make 6, 7, 8, and\r\n9 appear as second 1, second 2, etc., or another 1, another 2, etc.; or,\r\nmore simply still, as 1 more, 2 more, etc. It is the method which was\r\nbriefly discussed in the early part of the present chapter, and is by no\r\nmeans uncommon. In a decimal scale this repetition would begin with 11\r\ninstead of 6; as in the system found in use in Tagala and Pampanaga, two of\r\nthe Philippine Islands, where, for example, 11, 12, and 13 are:[97]\r\n\r\n  11.  labi-n-isa    = over 1.\r\n  12.  labi-n-dalaua = over 2.\r\n  13.  labi-n-tatlo  = over 3.\r\n\r\nA precisely similar method of numeral building is used by some of our\r\nWestern Indian tribes. Selecting a few of the Assiniboine numerals[98] as\r\nan illustration, we have\r\n\r\n  11.  ak kai washe      = more 1.\r\n  12.  ak kai noom pah   = more 2.\r\n  13.  ak kai yam me nee = more 3.\r\n  14.  ak kai to pah   = more 4.\r\n  15.  ak kai zap tah  = more 5.\r\n  16.  ak kai shak pah = more 6, etc.\r\n\r\nA still more primitive structure is shown in the numerals of the\r\nMboushas[99] of Equatorial Africa. Instead of using 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4, or\r\n2d 1, 2d 2, 2d 3, 2d 4, in forming their numerals from 6 to 9, they proceed\r\nin the following remarkable and, at first thought, inexplicable manner to\r\nform their compound numerals:\r\n\r\n   1.  ivoco.\r\n   2.  beba.\r\n   3.  belalo.\r\n   4.  benai.\r\n   5.  betano.\r\n   6.  ivoco beba   = 1-2.\r\n   7.  ivoco belalo = 1-3.\r\n   8.  ivoco benai  = 1-4.\r\n   9.  ivoco betano = 1-5.\r\n  10.  dioum.\r\n\r\nNo explanation is given by Mr. du Chaillu for such an apparently\r\nincomprehensible form of expression as, for example, 1-3, for 7. Some\r\npeculiar finger pantomime may accompany the counting, which, were it known,\r\nwould enlighten us on the Mbousha's method of arriving at so anomalous a\r\nscale. Mere repetition in the second quinate of the words used in the first\r\nmight readily be explained by supposing the use of fingers absolutely\r\nindispensable as an aid to counting, and that a certain word would have one\r\nmeaning when associated with a certain finger of the left hand, and another\r\nmeaning when associated with one of the fingers of the right. Such scales\r\nare, if the following are correct, actually in existence among the islands\r\nof the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BALAD.[100]                          UEA.[100]\r\n\r\n   1.  parai.                           1.  tahi.\r\n   2.  paroo.                           2.  lua.\r\n   3.  pargen.                          3.  tolu.\r\n   4.  parbai.                          4.  fa.\r\n   5.  panim.                           5.  lima.\r\n   6.  parai.                           6.  tahi.\r\n   7.  paroo.                           7.  lua.\r\n   8.  pargen.                          8.  tolu.\r\n   9.  parbai.                          9.  fa.\r\n  10.  panim.                          10.  lima.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch examples are, I believe, entirely unique among primitive number\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nIn numeral scales where the formative process has been of the general\r\nnature just exhibited, irregularities of various kinds are of frequent\r\noccurrence. Hand numerals may appear, and then suddenly disappear, just\r\nwhere we should look for them with the greatest degree of certainty. In the\r\nEnde,[101] a dialect of the Flores Islands, 5, 6, and 7 are of hand\r\nformation, while 8 and 9 are of entirely different origin, as the scale\r\nshows.\r\n\r\n   1.  sa.\r\n   2.  zua.\r\n   3.  telu.\r\n   4.  wutu.\r\n   5.  lima\r\n   6.  lima sa  = hand 1.\r\n   7.  lima zua = hand 2.\r\n   8.  rua butu = 2 × 4.\r\n   9.  trasa    = 10 - 1?\r\n  10.  sabulu.\r\n\r\nOne special point to be noticed in this scale is the irregularity that\r\nprevails between 7, 8, 9. The formation of 7 is of the most ordinary kind;\r\n8 is 2 fours--common enough duplication; while 9 appears to be 10 - 1. All\r\nof these modes of compounding are, in their own way, regular; but the\r\nirregularity consists in using all three of them in connective numerals in\r\nthe same system. But, odd as this jumble seems, it is more than matched by\r\nthat found in the scale of the Karankawa Indians,[102] an extinct tribe\r\nformerly inhabiting the coast region of Texas. The first ten numerals of\r\nthis singular array are:\r\n\r\n   1.  natsa.\r\n   2.  haikia.\r\n   3.  kachayi.\r\n   4.  hayo hakn     = 2 × 2.\r\n   5.  natsa behema  = 1 father, _i.e._ of the fingers.\r\n   6.  hayo haikia   = 3 × 2?\r\n   7.  haikia natsa  = 2 + 5?\r\n   8.  haikia behema = 2 fathers?\r\n   9.  haikia doatn  = 2d from 10?\r\n  10.  doatn habe.\r\n\r\nSystems like the above, where chaos instead of order seems to be the ruling\r\nprinciple, are of occasional occurrence, but they are decidedly the\r\nexception.\r\n\r\nIn some of the cases that have been adduced for illustration it is to be\r\nnoticed that the process of combination begins with 7 instead of with 6.\r\nAmong others, the scale of the Pigmies of Central Africa[103] and that of\r\nthe Mosquitos[104] of Central America show this tendency. In the Pigmy\r\nscale the words for 1 and 6 are so closely akin that one cannot resist the\r\nimpression that 6 was to them a new 1, and was thus named.\r\n\r\n\r\n       MOSQUITO.                           PIGMY.\r\n\r\n   1.  kumi.                               ujju.\r\n   2.  wal.                                ibari.\r\n   3.  niupa.                              ikaro.\r\n   4.  wal-wal  = 2-2.                     ikwanganya.\r\n   5.  mata-sip = fingers of 1 hand.       bumuti.\r\n   6.  matlalkabe.                         ijju.\r\n   7.  matlalkabe pura kumi  = 6 and 1.    bumutti-na-ibali = 5 and 2.\r\n   8.  matlalkabe pura wal   = 6 and 2.    bumutti-na-ikaro = 5 and 3.\r\n   9.  matlalkabe pura niupa = 6 and 3.    bumutti-na-ikwanganya = 5 and 4.\r\n  10.  mata wal sip = fingers of 2 hands.  mabo = half man.\r\n\r\nThe Mosquito scale is quite exceptional in forming 7, 8, and 9 from 6,\r\ninstead of from 5. The usual method, where combinations appear between 6\r\nand 10, is exhibited by the Pigmy scale. Still another species of numeral\r\nform, quite different from any that have already been noticed, is found in\r\nthe Yoruba[105] scale, which is in many respects one of the most peculiar\r\nin existence. Here the words for 11, 12, etc., are formed by adding the\r\nsuffix _-la_, great, to the words for 1, 2, etc., thus:\r\n\r\n    1.  eni, or okan.\r\n    2.  edzi.\r\n    3.  eta.\r\n    4.  erin.\r\n    5.  arun.\r\n    6.  efa.\r\n    7.  edze.\r\n    8.  edzo.\r\n    9.  esan.\r\n   10.  ewa.\r\n   11.  okanla = great 1.\r\n   12.  edzila = great 2.\r\n   13.  etala  = great 3.\r\n   14.  erinla = great 4, etc.\r\n   40.  ogodzi = string.\r\n  200.  igba   = heap.\r\n\r\nThe word for 40 was adopted because cowrie shells, which are used for\r\ncounting, were strung by forties; and _igba_, 200, because a heap of 200\r\nshells was five strings, and thus formed a convenient higher unit for\r\nreckoning. Proceeding in this curious manner,[106] they called 50 strings 1\r\n_afo_ or head; and to illustrate their singular mode of reckoning--the king\r\nof the Dahomans, having made war on the Yorubans, and attacked their army,\r\nwas repulsed and defeated with a loss of \"two heads, twenty strings, and\r\ntwenty cowries\" of men, or 4820.\r\n\r\nThe number scale of the Abipones,[107] one of the low tribes of the\r\nParaguay region, contains two genuine curiosities, and by reason of those\r\nit deserves a place among any collection of numeral scales designed to\r\nexhibit the formation of this class of words. It is:\r\n\r\n   1.  initara = 1 alone.\r\n   2.  inoaka.\r\n   3.  inoaka yekaini = 2 and 1.\r\n   4.  geyenknate     = toes of an ostrich.\r\n   5.  neenhalek      = a five coloured, spotted hide,\r\n        or hanambegen = fingers of 1 hand.\r\n  10.  lanamrihegem   = fingers of both hands.\r\n  20.  lanamrihegem cat gracherhaka anamichirihegem = fingers of both\r\n       hands together with toes of both feet.\r\n\r\nThat the number sense of the Abipones is but little, if at all, above that\r\nof the native Australian tribes, is shown by their expressing 3 by the\r\ncombination 2 and 1. This limitation, as we have already seen, is shared by\r\nthe Botocudos, the Chiquitos, and many of the other native races of South\r\nAmerica. But the Abipones, in seeking for words with which to enable\r\nthemselves to pass beyond the limit 3, invented the singular terms just\r\ngiven for 4 and 5. The ostrich, having three toes in front and one behind\r\non each foot presented them with a living example of 3 + 1; hence \"toes of\r\nan ostrich\" became their numeral for 4. Similarly, the number of colours in\r\na certain hide being five, the name for that hide was adopted as their next\r\nnumeral. At this point they began to resort to digital numeration also; and\r\nany higher number is expressed by that method.\r\n\r\nIn the sense in which the word is defined by mathematicians, _number_ is a\r\npure, abstract concept. But a moment's reflection will show that, as it\r\noriginates among savage races, number is, and from the limitations of their\r\nintellect must be, entirely concrete. An abstract conception is something\r\nquite foreign to the essentially primitive mind, as missionaries and\r\nexplorers have found to their chagrin. The savage can form no mental\r\nconcept of what civilized man means by such a word as \"soul\"; nor would his\r\nidea of the abstract number 5 be much clearer. When he says _five_, he\r\nuses, in many cases at least, the same word that serves him when he wishes\r\nto say _hand_; and his mental concept when he says _five_ is of a hand. The\r\nconcrete idea of a closed fist or an open hand with outstretched fingers,\r\nis what is upper-most in his mind. He knows no more and cares no more about\r\nthe pure number 5 than he does about the law of the conservation of energy.\r\nHe sees in his mental picture only the real, material image, and his only\r\ncomprehension of the number is, \"these objects are as many as the fingers\r\non my hand.\" Then, in the lapse of the long interval of centuries which\r\nintervene between lowest barbarism and highest civilization, the abstract\r\nand the concrete become slowly dissociated, the one from the other. First\r\nthe actual hand picture fades away, and the number is recognized without\r\nthe original assistance furnished by the derivation of the word. But the\r\nnumber is still for a long time a certain number _of objects_, and not an\r\nindependent concept. It is only when the savage ceases to be wholly an\r\nanimal, and becomes a thinking human being, that number in the abstract can\r\ncome within the grasp of his mind. It is at this point that mere reckoning\r\nceases, and arithmetic begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF NUMBER WORDS.\r\n(_CONTINUED_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the slow, and often painful, process incident to the extension and\r\ndevelopment of any mental conception in a mind wholly unused to\r\nabstractions, the savage gropes his way onward in his counting from 1, or\r\nmore probably from 2, to the various higher numbers required to form his\r\nscale. The perception of unity offers no difficulty to his mind, though he\r\nis conscious at first of the object itself rather than of any idea of\r\nnumber associated with it. The concept of duality, also, is grasped with\r\nperfect readiness. This concept is, in its simplest form, presented to the\r\nmind as soon as the individual distinguishes himself from another person,\r\nthough the idea is still essentially concrete. Perhaps the first glimmering\r\nof any real number thought in connection with 2 comes when the savage\r\ncontrasts one single object with another--or, in other words, when he first\r\nrecognizes the _pair_. At first the individuals composing the pair are\r\nsimply \"this one,\" and \"that one,\" or \"this and that\"; and his number\r\nsystem now halts for a time at the stage when he can, rudely enough it may\r\nbe, count 1, 2, many. There are certain cases where the forms of 1 and 2\r\nare so similar than one may readily imagine that these numbers really were\r\n\"this\" and \"that\" in the savage's original conception of them; and the same\r\nlikeness also occurs in the words for 3 and 4, which may readily enough\r\nhave been a second \"this\" and a second \"that.\" In the Lushu tongue the\r\nwords for 1 and 2 are _tizi_ and _tazi_ respectively. In Koriak we find\r\n_ngroka_, 3, and _ngraka_, 4; in Kolyma, _niyokh_, 3, and _niyakh_, 4; and\r\nin Kamtschatkan, _tsuk_, 3, and _tsaak_, 4.[108] Sometimes, as in the case\r\nof the Australian races, the entire extent of the count is carried through\r\nby means of pairs. But the natural theory one would form is, that 2 is the\r\nhalting place for a very long time; that up to this point the fingers may\r\nor may not have been used--probably not; and that when the next start is\r\nmade, and 3, 4, 5, and so on are counted, the fingers first come into\r\nrequisition. If the grammatical structure of the earlier languages of the\r\nworld's history is examined, the student is struck with the prevalence of\r\nthe dual number in them--something which tends to disappear as language\r\nundergoes extended development. The dual number points unequivocally to the\r\ntime when 1 and 2 were _the_ numbers at mankind's disposal; to the time\r\nwhen his three numeral concepts, 1, 2, many, each demanded distinct\r\nexpression. With increasing knowledge the necessity for this\r\ndifferentiatuin would pass away, and but two numbers, singular and plural,\r\nwould remain. Incidentally it is to be noticed that the Indo-European words\r\nfor 3--_three_, _trois_, _drei_, _tres_, _tri,_ etc., have the same root as\r\nthe Latin _trans_, beyond, and give us a hint of the time when our Aryan\r\nancestors counted in the manner I have just described.\r\n\r\nThe first real difficulty which the savage experiences in counting, the\r\ndifficulty which comes when he attempts to pass beyond 2, and to count 3,\r\n4, and 5, is of course but slight; and these numbers are commonly used and\r\nreadily understood by almost all tribes, no matter how deeply sunk in\r\nbarbarism we find them. But the instances that have already been cited must\r\nnot be forgotten. The Chiquitos do not, in their primitive state, properly\r\ncount at all; the Andamans, the Veddas, and many of the Australian tribes\r\nhave no numerals higher than 2; others of the Australians and many of the\r\nSouth Americans stop with 3 or 4; and tribes which make 5 their limit are\r\nstill more numerous. Hence it is safe to assert that even this\r\ninsignificant number is not always reached with perfect ease. Beyond 5\r\nprimitive man often proceeds with the greatest difficulty. Most savages,\r\neven those of the tribes just mentioned, can really count above here, even\r\nthough they have no words with which to express their thought. But they do\r\nit with reluctance, and as they go on they quickly lose all sense of\r\naccuracy. This has already been commented on, but to emphasize it afresh\r\nthe well-known example given by Mr. Oldfield from his own experience among\r\nthe Watchandies may be quoted.[109] \"I once wished to ascertain the exact\r\nnumber of natives who had been slain on a certain occasion. The individual\r\nof whom I made the inquiry began to think over the names ... assigning one\r\nof his fingers to each, and it was not until after many failures, and\r\nconsequent fresh starts, that he was able to express so high a number,\r\nwhich he at length did by holding up his hand three times, thus giving me\r\nto understand that fifteen was the answer to this most difficult\r\narithmetical question.\" This meagreness of knowledge in all things\r\npertaining to numbers is often found to be sharply emphasized in the names\r\nadopted by savages for their numeral words. While discussing in a previous\r\nchapter the limits of number systems, we found many instances where\r\nanything above 2 or 3 was designated by some one of the comprehensive terms\r\n_much_, _many_, _very many_; these words, or such equivalents as _lot_,\r\n_heap_, or _plenty_, serving as an aid to the finger pantomime necessary to\r\nindicate numbers for which they have no real names. The low degree of\r\nintelligence and civilization revealed by such words is brought quite as\r\nsharply into prominence by the word occasionally found for 5. Whenever the\r\nfingers and hands are used at all, it would seem natural to expect for 5\r\nsome general expression signifying _hand_, for 10 _both hands_, and for 20\r\n_man_. Such is, as we have already seen, the ordinary method of\r\nprogression, but it is not universal. A drop in the scale of civilization\r\ntakes us to a point where 10, instead of 20, becomes the whole man. The\r\nKusaies,[110] of Strong's Island, call 10 _sie-nul_, 1 man, 30 _tol-nul_, 3\r\nmen, 40 _a naul_, 4 men, etc.; and the Ku-Mbutti[111] of central Africa\r\nhave _mukko_, 10, and _moku_, man. If 10 is to be expressed by reference to\r\nthe man, instead of his hands, it might appear more natural to employ some\r\nsuch expression as that adopted by the African Pigmies,[112] who call 10\r\n_mabo_, and man _mabo-mabo_. With them, then, 10 is perhaps \"half a man,\"\r\nas it actually is among the Towkas of South America; and we have already\r\nseen that with the Aztecs it was _matlactli_, the \"hand half\" of a\r\nman.[113] The same idea crops out in the expression used by the Nicobar\r\nIslanders for 30--_heam-umdjome ruktei_, 1 man (and a) half.[114] Such\r\nnomenclature is entirely natural, and it accords with the analogy offered\r\nby other words of frequent occurrence in the numeral scales of savage\r\nraces. Still, to find 10 expressed by the term _man_ always conveys an\r\nimpression of mental poverty; though it may, of course, be urged that this\r\nmight arise from the fact that some races never use the toes in counting,\r\nbut go over the fingers again, or perhaps bring into requisition the\r\nfingers of a second man to express the second 10. It is not safe to\r\npostulate an extremely low degree of civilization from the presence of\r\ncertain peculiarities of numeral formation. Only the most general\r\nstatements can be ventured on, and these are always subject to modification\r\nthrough some circumstance connected with environment, mode of living, or\r\nintercourse with other tribes. Two South American races may be cited, which\r\nseem in this respect to give unmistakable evidence of being sunk in deepest\r\nbarbarism. These are the Juri and the Cayriri, who use the same word for\r\nman and for 5. The former express 5 by _ghomen apa_, 1 man,[115] and the\r\nlatter by _ibicho_, person.[116] The Tasmanians of Oyster Bay use the\r\nnative word of similar meaning, _puggana_, man,[117] for 5.\r\n\r\nWherever the numeral 20 is expressed by the term _man_, it may be expected\r\nthat 40 will be 2 men, 60, 3 men, etc. This form of numeration is usually,\r\nthough not always, carried as far as the system extends; and it sometimes\r\nleads to curious terms, of which a single illustration will suffice. The\r\nSan Blas Indians, like almost all the other Central and South American\r\ntribes, count by digit numerals, and form their twenties as follows:[118]\r\n\r\n    20.  tula guena  = man 1.\r\n    40.  tula pogua  = man 2.\r\n   100.  tula atala  = man 5.\r\n   120.  tula nergua = man 6.\r\n  1000.  tula wala guena = great 1 man.\r\n\r\nThe last expression may, perhaps, be translated \"great hundred,\" though the\r\nliteral meaning is the one given. If 10, instead of 20, is expressed by the\r\nword \"man,\" the multiples of 10 follow the law just given for multiples of\r\n20. This is sufficiently indicated by the Kusaie scale; or equally well by\r\nthe Api words for 100 and 200, which are[119]\r\n\r\n     _duulimo toromomo_ = 10 times the whole man.\r\n\r\n     _duulimo toromomo va juo_ = 10 times the whole man taken 2 times.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the legitimate result which is produced by the\r\nattempt to express high numbers in this manner the term applied by educated\r\nnative Greenlanders[120] for a thousand may be cited. This numeral, which\r\nis, of course, not in common use, is\r\n\r\n     _inuit kulit tatdlima nik kuleriartut navdlugit_ = 10 men 5 times 10\r\n                                                      times come to an end.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the word \"great,\" which appears in the scale of the\r\nSan Blas Indians, is not infrequently made use of in the formation of\r\nhigher numeral words. The African Mabas[121] call 10 _atuk_, great 1; the\r\nHottentots[122] and the Hidatsa Indians call 100 great 10, their words\r\nbeing _gei disi_ and _pitikitstia_ respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Nicaraguans[123] express 100 by _guhamba_, great 10, and 400 by\r\n_dinoamba_, great 20; and our own familiar word \"million,\" which so many\r\nmodern languages have borrowed from the Italian, is nothing more nor less\r\nthan a derivative of the Latin _mille_, and really means \"great thousand.\"\r\nThe Dakota[124] language shows the same origin for its expression of\r\n1,000,000, which is _kick ta opong wa tunkah_, great 1000. The origin of\r\nsuch terms can hardly be ascribed to poverty of language. It is found,\r\nrather, in the mental association of the larger with the smaller unit, and\r\nthe consequent repetition of the name of the smaller. Any unit, whether it\r\nbe a single thing, a dozen, a score, a hundred, a thousand, or any other\r\nunit, is, whenever used, a single and complete group; and where the\r\nrelation between them is sufficiently close, as in our \"gross\" and \"great\r\ngross,\" this form of nomenclature is natural enough to render it a matter\r\nof some surprise that it has not been employed more frequently. An old\r\nEnglish nursery rhyme makes use of this association, only in a manner\r\nprecisely the reverse of that which appears now and then in numeral terms.\r\nIn the latter case the process is always one of enlargement, and the\r\nassociative word is \"great.\" In the following rhyme, constructed by the\r\nmature for the amusement of the childish mind, the process is one of\r\ndiminution, and the associative word is \"little\":\r\n\r\n   One's none,\r\n   Two's some,\r\n   Three's a many,\r\n   Four's a penny,\r\n   Five's a little hundred.[125]\r\n\r\nAny real numeral formation by the use of \"little,\" with the name of some\r\nhigher unit, would, of course, be impossible. The numeral scale must be\r\ncomplete before the nursery rhyme can be manufactured.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed from the observations that have been made on the\r\nformation of savage numeral scales that all, or even the majority of\r\ntribes, proceed in the awkward and faltering manner indicated by many of\r\nthe examples quoted. Some of the North American Indian tribes have numeral\r\nscales which are, as far as they go, as regular and almost as simple as our\r\nown. But where digital numeration is extensively resorted to, the\r\nexpressions for higher numbers are likely to become complex, and to act as\r\na real bar to the extension of the system. The same thing is true, to an\r\neven greater degree, of tribes whose number sense is so defective that they\r\nbegin almost from the outset to use combinations. If a savage expresses the\r\nnumber 3 by the combination 2-1, it will at once be suspected that his\r\nnumerals will, by the time he reaches 10 or 20, become so complex and\r\nconfused that numbers as high as these will be expressed by finger\r\npantomime rather than by words. Such is often the case; and the comment is\r\nfrequently made by explorers that the tribes they have visited have no\r\nwords for numbers higher than 3, 4, 5, 10, or 20, but that counting is\r\ncarried beyond that point by the aid of fingers or other objects. So\r\nreluctant, in many cases, are savages to count by words, that limits have\r\nbeen assigned for spoken numerals, which subsequent investigation proved to\r\nfall far short of the real extent of the number systems to which they\r\nbelonged. One of the south-western Indian tribes of the United States, the\r\nComanches, was for a time supposed to have no numeral words below 10, but\r\nto count solely by the use of fingers. But the entire scale of this\r\ntaciturn tribe was afterward discovered and published.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the awkward and inconvenient forms of expression which\r\nabound in primitive numeral nomenclature, one has only to draw from such\r\nscales as those of the Zuñi, or the Point Barrow Eskimos, given in the\r\nlast chapter.  Terms such as are found there may readily be duplicated\r\nfrom almost any quarter of the globe. The Soussous of Sierra Leone[126]\r\ncall 99 _tongo solo manani nun solo manani_, _i.e._ to take (10\r\nunderstood) 5 + 4 times and 5 + 4. The Malagasy expression for 1832\r\nis[127] _roambistelo polo amby valonjato amby arivo_, 2 + 30 + 800 + 1000.\r\nThe Aztec equivalent for 399 is[128] _caxtolli onnauh poalli ipan caxtolli\r\nonnaui_, (15 + 4)  × 20 + 15 + 4; and the Sioux require for 29 the\r\nponderous combination[129] _wick a chimen ne nompah sam pah nep e chu wink\r\na._ These terms, long and awkward as they seem, are only the legitimate\r\nresults which arise from combining the names of the higher and lower\r\nnumbers, according to the peculiar genius of each language. From some of\r\nthe Australian tribes are derived expressions still more complex, as for\r\n6, _marh-jin-bang-ga-gudjir-gyn_, half the hands and 1; and for 15,\r\n_marh-jin-belli-belli-gudjir-jina-bang-ga_, the hand on either side and\r\nhalf the feet.[130] The Maré tribe, one of the numerous island tribes of\r\nMelanesia,[131] required for a translation of the numeral 38, which occurs\r\nin John v. 5, \"had an infirmity thirty and eight years,\" the\r\ncircumlocution, \"one man and both sides five and three.\" Such expressions,\r\ncurious as they seem at first thought, are no more than the natural\r\noutgrowth of systems built up by the slow and tedious process which so\r\noften obtains among primitive races, where digit numerals are combined in\r\nan almost endless variety of ways, and where mere reduplication often\r\nserves in place of any independent names for higher units. To what extent\r\nthis may be carried is shown by the language of the Cayubabi,[132] who have\r\nfor 10 the word _tunca_, and for 100 and 1000 the compounds _tunca tunca_,\r\nand _tunca tunca tunca_ respectively; or of the Sapibocones, who call 10\r\n_bururuche_, hand hand, and 100 _buruche buruche_, hand hand hand\r\nhand.[133] More remarkable still is the Ojibwa language, which continues\r\nits numeral scale without limit, furnishing combinations which are really\r\nremarkable; as, _e.g._, that for 1,000,000,000, which is _me das wac me das\r\nwac as he me das wac_,[134] 1000 × 1000  × 1000. The Winnebago expression\r\nfor the same number,[135] _ho ke he hhuta hhu chen a ho ke he ka ra pa ne\r\nza_ is no less formidable, but it has every appearance of being an honest,\r\nnative combination. All such primitive terms for larger numbers must,\r\nhowever, be received with caution. Savages are sometimes eager to display a\r\nknowledge they do not possess, and have been known to invent numeral words\r\non the spot for the sake of carrying their scales to as high a limit as\r\npossible. The Choctaw words for million and billion are obvious attempts to\r\nincorporate the corresponding English terms into their own language.[136]\r\nFor million they gave the vocabulary-hunter the phrase _mil yan chuffa_,\r\nand for billion, _bil yan chuffa_. The word _chuffa_ signifies 1, hence\r\nthese expressions are seen at a glance to be coined solely for the purpose\r\nof gratifying a little harmless Choctaw vanity. But this is innocence\r\nitself compared with the fraud perpetrated on Labillardière by the Tonga\r\nIslanders, who supplied the astonished and delighted investigator with a\r\nnumeral vocabulary up to quadrillions. Their real limit was afterward found\r\nto be 100,000, and above that point they had palmed off as numerals a\r\ntolerably complete list of the obscene words of their language, together\r\nwith a few nonsense terms. These were all accepted and printed in good\r\nfaith, and the humiliating truth was not discovered until years\r\nafterward.[137]\r\n\r\nOne noteworthy and interesting fact relating to numeral nomenclature is the\r\nvariation in form which words of this class undergo when applied to\r\ndifferent classes of objects. To one accustomed as we are to absolute and\r\nunvarying forms for numerals, this seems at first a novel and almost\r\nunaccountable linguistic freak. But it is not uncommon among uncivilized\r\nraces, and is extensively employed by so highly enlightened a people, even,\r\nas the Japanese. This variation in form is in no way analogous to that\r\nproduced by inflectional changes, such as occur in Hebrew, Greek, Latin,\r\netc. It is sufficient in many cases to produce almost an entire change in\r\nthe form of the word; or to result in compounds which require close\r\nscrutiny for the detection of the original root. For example, in the\r\nCarrier, one of the Déné dialects of western Canada, the word _tha_ means 3\r\nthings; _thane_, 3 persons; _that_, 3 times; _thatoen_, in 3 places;\r\n_thauh_, in 3 ways; _thailtoh_, all of the 3 things; _thahoeltoh_, all of\r\nthe 3 persons; and _thahultoh_, all of the 3 times.[138] In the Tsimshian\r\nlanguage of British Columbia we find seven distinct sets of numerals \"which\r\nare used for various classes of objects that are counted. The first set is\r\nused in counting where there is no definite object referred to; the second\r\nclass is used for counting flat objects and animals; the third for counting\r\nround objects and divisions of time; the fourth for counting men; the fifth\r\nfor counting long objects, the numerals being composed with _kan_, tree;\r\nthe sixth for counting canoes; and the seventh for measures. The last seem\r\nto be composed with _anon_, hand.\"[139] The first ten numerals of each of\r\nthese classes is given in the following table:\r\n\r\n +----+---------+---------+---------+----------+------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n |No. |Counting | Flat    | Round   | Men      | Long       | Canoes      | Measures    |\r\n |    |         | Objects | Objects |          | Objects    |             |             |\r\n +----+---------+---------+---------+----------+------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n | 1  |gyak gak |g'erel   |k'al     |k'awutskan|k'amaet     |k'al         |             |\r\n | 2  |t'epqat  |t'epqat  |goupel   |t'epqadal |gaopskan    |g'alp[=e]eltk|gulbel       |\r\n | 3  |guant    |guant    |gutle    |gulal     |galtskan    |galtskantk   |guleont      |\r\n | 4  |tqalpq   |tqalpq   |tqalpq   |tqalpqdal |tqaapskan   |tqalpqsk     |tqalpqalont  |\r\n | 5  |kct[=o]nc|kct[=o]nc|kct[=o]nc|kcenecal  |k'etoentskan|kct[=o]onsk  |kctonsilont  |\r\n | 6  |k'alt    |k'alt    |k'alt    |k'aldal   |k'aoltskan  |k'altk       |k'aldelont   |\r\n | 7  |t'epqalt |t'epqalt |t'epqalt |t'epqaldal|t'epqaltskan|t'epqaltk    |t'epqaldelont|\r\n | 8  |guandalt |yuktalt  |yuktalt  |yuktleadal|ek'tlaedskan|yuktaltk     |yuktaldelont |\r\n | 9  |kctemac  |kctemac  |kctemac  |kctemacal |kctemaestkan|kctemack     |kctemasilont |\r\n |10  |gy'ap    |gy'ap    |kp[=e]el |kpal      |kp[=e]etskan|gy'apsk      |kpeont       |\r\n +----+---------+---------+---------+----------+------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n\r\nRemarkable as this list may appear, it is by no means as extensive as that\r\nderived from many of the other British Columbian tribes. The numerals of\r\nthe Shushwap, Stlatlumh, Okanaken, and other languages of this region exist\r\nin several different forms, and can also be modified by any of the\r\ninnumerable suffixes of these tongues.[140] To illustrate the almost\r\nillimitable number of sets that may be formed, a table is given of \"a few\r\nclasses, taken from the Heiltsuk dialect.[141] It appears from these\r\nexamples that the number of classes is unlimited.\"\r\n\r\n +-----------------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n |                       | One.        | Two.         | Three.       |\r\n +-----------------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n |Animate.               |menok        |maalok        |yutuk         |\r\n |Round.                 |menskam      |masem         |yutqsem       |\r\n |Long.                  |ments'ak     |mats'ak       |yututs'ak     |\r\n |Flat.                  |menaqsa      |matlqsa       |yutqsa        |\r\n |Day.                   |op'enequls   |matlp'enequls |yutqp'enequls |\r\n |Fathom.                |op'enkh      |matlp'enkh    |yutqp'enkh    |\r\n |Grouped together.      |----         |matloutl      |yutoutl       |\r\n |Groups of objects.     |nemtsmots'utl|matltsmots'utl|yutqtsmots'utl|\r\n |Filled cup.            |menqtlala    |matl'aqtlala  |yutqtlala     |\r\n |Empty cup.             |menqtla      |matl'aqtla    |yutqtla       |\r\n |Full box.              |menskamala   |masemala      |yutqsemala    |\r\n |Empty box.             |menskam      |masem         |yutqsem       |\r\n |Loaded canoe.          |mentsake     |mats'ake      |yututs'ake    |\r\n |Canoe with crew.       |ments'akis   |mats'akla     |yututs'akla   |\r\n |Together on beach.     |----         |maalis        |----          |\r\n |Together in house, etc.|----         |maalitl       |----          |\r\n +-----------------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nVariation in numeral forms such as is exhibited in the above tables is not\r\nconfined to any one quarter of the globe; but it is more universal among\r\nthe British Columbian Indians than among any other race, and it is a more\r\ncharacteristic linguistic peculiarity of this than of any other region,\r\neither in the Old World or in the New. It was to some extent employed by\r\nthe Aztecs,[142] and its use is current among the Japanese; in whose\r\nlanguage Crawfurd finds fourteen different classes of numerals \"without\r\nexhausting the list.\"[143]\r\n\r\nIn examining the numerals of different languages it will be found that the\r\ntens of any ordinary decimal scale are formed in the same manner as in\r\nEnglish. Twenty is simply 2 times 10; 30 is 3 times 10, and so on. The word\r\n\"times\" is, of course, not expressed, any more than in English; but the\r\nexpressions briefly are, 2 tens, 3 tens, etc. But a singular exception to\r\nthis method is presented by the Hebrew, and other of the Semitic languages.\r\nIn Hebrew the word for 20 is the plural of the word for 10; and 30, 40, 50,\r\netc. to 90 are plurals of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. These numerals are as\r\nfollows:[144]\r\n\r\n  10,  eser,     20,  eserim,\r\n   3,  shalosh,  30,  shaloshim,\r\n   4,  arba,     40,  arbaim,\r\n   5,  chamesh,  50,  chamishshim,\r\n   6,  shesh,    60,  sheshshim,\r\n   7,  sheba,    70,  shibim,\r\n   8,  shemoneh  80,  shemonim,\r\n   9,  tesha,    90,  tishim.\r\n\r\nThe same formation appears in the numerals of the ancient Phoenicians,[145]\r\nand seems, indeed, to be a well-marked characteristic of the various\r\nbranches of this division of the Caucasian race. An analogous method\r\nappears in the formation of the tens in the Bisayan,[146] one of the Malay\r\nnumeral scales, where 30, 40, ... 90, are constructed from 3, 4, ... 9, by\r\nadding the termination _-an_.\r\n\r\nNo more interesting contribution has ever been made to the literature of\r\nnumeral nomenclature than that in which Dr. Trumbull embodies the results\r\nof his scholarly research among the languages of the native Indian tribes\r\nof this country.[147] As might be expected, we are everywhere confronted\r\nwith a digital origin, direct or indirect, in the great body of the words\r\nexamined. But it is clearly shown that such a derivation cannot be\r\nestablished for all numerals; and evidence collected by the most recent\r\nresearch fully substantiates the position taken by Dr. Trumbull. Nearly all\r\nthe derivations established are such as to remind us of the meanings we\r\nhave already seen recurring in one form or another in language after\r\nlanguage. Five is the end of the finger count on one hand--as, the Micmac\r\n_nan_, and Mohegan _nunon_, gone, or spent; the Pawnee _sihuks_, hands\r\nhalf; the Dakota _zaptan_, hand turned down; and the Massachusetts\r\n_napanna_, on one side. Ten is the end of the finger count, but is not\r\nalways expressed by the \"both hands\" formula so commonly met with. The Cree\r\nterm for this number is _mitatat_, no further; and the corresponding word\r\nin Delaware is _m'tellen_, no more. The Dakota 10 is, like its 5, a\r\nstraightening out of the fingers which have been turned over in counting,\r\nor _wickchemna_, spread out unbent. The same is true of the Hidatsa\r\n_pitika_, which signifies a smoothing out, or straightening. The Pawnee 4,\r\n_skitiks_, is unusual, signifying as it does \"all the fingers,\" or more\r\nproperly, \"the fingers of the hand.\" The same meaning attaches to this\r\nnumeral in a few other languages also, and reminds one of the habit some\r\npeople have of beginning to count on the forefinger and proceeding from\r\nthere to the little finger. Can this have been the habit of the tribes in\r\nquestion? A suggestion of the same nature is made by the Illinois and Miami\r\nwords for 8, _parare_ and _polane_, which signify \"nearly ended.\" Six is\r\nalmost always digital in origin, though the derivation may be indirect, as\r\nin the Illinois _kakatchui_, passing beyond the middle; and the Dakota\r\n_shakpe_, 1 in addition. Some of these significations are well matched by\r\nnumerals from the Ewe scales of western Africa, where we find the\r\nfollowing:[148]\r\n\r\n   1.  de = a going, _i.e._ a beginning. (Cf. the Zuñi _töpinte_, taken to\r\n            start with.)\r\n   3.  eto    = the father (from the middle, or longest finger).\r\n   6.  ade    = the other going.\r\n   9.  asieke = parting with the hands.\r\n  10.  ewo    = done.\r\n\r\nIn studying the names for 2 we are at once led away from a strictly digital\r\norigin for the terms by which this number is expressed. These names seem to\r\ncome from four different sources: (1) roots denoting separation or\r\ndistinction; (2) likeness, equality, or opposition; (3) addition, _i.e._\r\nputting to, or putting with; (4) coupling, pairing, or matching. They are\r\noften related to, and perhaps derived from, names of natural pairs, as\r\nfeet, hands, eyes, arms, or wings. In the Dakota and Algonkin dialects 2 is\r\nalmost always related to \"arms\" or \"hands,\" and in the Athapaskan to\r\n\"feet.\" But the relationship is that of common origin, rather than of\r\nderivation from these pair-names. In the Puri and Hottentot languages, 2\r\nand \"hand\" are closely allied; while in Sanskrit, 2 may be expressed by any\r\none of the words _kara_, hand, _bahu_, arm, _paksha_, wing, or _netra,_\r\neye.[149] Still more remote from anything digital in their derivation are\r\nthe following, taken at random from a very great number of examples that\r\nmight be cited to illustrate this point. The Assiniboines call 7, _shak ko\r\nwe_, or _u she nah_, the odd number.[150] The Crow 1, _hamat,_ signifies\r\n\"the least\";[151] the Mississaga 1, _pecik_, a very small thing.[152] In\r\nJavanese, Malay, and Manadu, the words for 1, which are respectively\r\n_siji_, _satu_, and _sabuah_, signify 1 seed, 1 pebble, and 1 fruit\r\nrespectively[153]--words as natural and as much to be expected at the\r\nbeginning of a number scale as any finger name could possibly be. Among\r\nalmost all savage races one form or another of palpable arithmetic is\r\nfound, such as counting by seeds, pebbles, shells, notches, or knots; and\r\nthe derivation of number words from these sources can constitute no ground\r\nfor surprise. The Marquesan word for 4 is _pona_, knot, from the practice\r\nof tying breadfruit in knots of 4. The Maori 10 is _tekau_, bunch, or\r\nparcel, from the counting of yams and fish by parcels of 10.[154] The\r\nJavanese call 25, _lawe_, a thread, or string; 50, _ekat_, a skein of\r\nthread; 400, _samas_, a bit of gold; 800, _domas_, 2 bits of gold.[155] The\r\nMacassar and Butong term for 100 is _bilangan_, 1 tale or reckoning.[156]\r\nThe Aztec 20 is _cem pohualli_, 1 count; 400 is _centzontli_, 1 hair of the\r\nhead; and 8000 is _xiquipilli_, sack.[157] This sack was of such a size as\r\nto contain 8000 cacao nibs, or grains, hence the derivation of the word in\r\nits numeral sense is perfectly natural. In Japanese we find a large number\r\nof terms which, as applied to the different units of the number scale, seem\r\nalmost purely fanciful. These words, with their meanings as given by a\r\nJapanese lexicon, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  10,000, or 10^4,  män   = enormous number.\r\n             10^8,  oku   = a compound of the words \"man\" and \"mind.\"\r\n             10^12, chio  = indication, or symptom.\r\n             10^16, kei   = capital city.\r\n             10^20, si    = a term referring to grains.\r\n             10^24, owi   = ----\r\n             10^28, jio   = extent of land.\r\n             10^32, ko    = canal.\r\n             10^36, kan   = some kind of a body of water.\r\n             10^40, sai   = justice.\r\n             10^44, s[=a] = support.\r\n             10^48, kioku = limit, or more strictly, ultimate.\r\n            .01^2,  rin   = ----\r\n            .01^3,  mo    = hair (of some animal).\r\n            .01^4,  shi   = thread.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, some of the lower fractional values are described by\r\nwords meaning \"very small,\" \"very fine thread,\" \"sand grain,\" \"dust,\" and\r\n\"very vague.\" Taken altogether, the Japanese number system is the most\r\nremarkable I have ever examined, in the extent and variety of the higher\r\nnumerals with well-defined descriptive names. Most of the terms employed\r\nare such as to defy any attempt to trace the process of reasoning which led\r\nto their adoption. It is not improbable that the choice was, in some of\r\nthese cases at least, either accidental or arbitrary; but still, the\r\nchanges in word meanings which occur with the lapse of time may have\r\ndifferentiated significations originally alike, until no trace of kinship\r\nwould appear to the casual observer. Our numerals \"score\" and \"gross\" are\r\nnever thought of as having any original relation to what is conveyed by the\r\nother meanings which attach to these words. But the origin of each, which\r\nis easily traced, shows that, in the beginning, there existed a\r\nwell-defined reason for the selection of these, rather than other terms,\r\nfor the numbers they now describe. Possibly these remarkable Japanese terms\r\nmay be accounted for in the same way, though the supposition is, for some\r\nreasons, quite improbable. The same may be said for the Malagasy 1000,\r\n_alina_, which also means \"night,\" and the Hebrew 6, _shesh_, which has the\r\nadditional signification \"white marble,\" and the stray exceptions which now\r\nand then come to the light in this or that language. Such terms as these\r\nmay admit of some logical explanation, but for the great mass of numerals\r\nwhose primitive meanings can be traced at all, no explanation whatever is\r\nneeded; the words are self-explanatory, as the examples already cited show.\r\n\r\nA few additional examples of natural derivation may still further emphasize\r\nthe point just discussed. In Bambarese the word for 10, _tank_, is derived\r\ndirectly from _adang_, to count.[158] In the language of Mota, one of the\r\nislands of Melanesia, 100 is _mel nol_, used and done with, referring to\r\nthe leaves of the cycas tree, with which the count had been carried\r\non.[159] In many other Melanesian dialects[160] 100 is _rau_, a branch or\r\nleaf. In the Torres Straits we find the same number expressed by _na won_,\r\nthe close; and in Eromanga it is _narolim narolim_ (2 × 5)(2 × 5).[161]\r\nThis combination deserves remark only because of the involved form which\r\nseems to have been required for the expression of so small a number as 100.\r\nA compound instead of a simple term for any higher unit is never to be\r\nwondered at, so rude are some of the savage methods of expressing number;\r\nbut \"two fives (times) two fives\" is certainly remarkable. Some form like\r\nthat employed by the Nusqually[162] of Puget Sound for 1000, i.e.\r\n_paduts-subquätche_, ten hundred, is more in accordance with primitive\r\nmethod. But we are equally likely to find such descriptive phrases for this\r\nnumeral as the _dor paka_, banyan roots, of the Torres Islands; _rau na\r\nhai_, leaves of a tree, of Vaturana; or _udolu_, all, of the Fiji Islands.\r\nAnd two curious phrases for 1000 are those of the Banks' Islands, _tar\r\nmataqelaqela_, eye blind thousand, _i.e._ many beyond count; and of\r\nMalanta, _warehune huto_, opossum's hairs, or _idumie one_, count the\r\nsand.[163]\r\n\r\nThe native languages of India, Thibet, and portions of the Indian\r\narchipelago furnish us with abundant instances of the formation of\r\nsecondary numeral scales, which were used only for special purposes, and\r\nwithout in any way interfering with the use of the number words already in\r\nuse. \"Thus the scholars of India, ages ago, selected a set of words for a\r\nmemoria technica, in order to record dates and numbers. These words they\r\nchose for reasons which are still in great measure evident; thus 'moon' or\r\n'earth' expressed 1, there being but one of each; 2 might be called 'eye,'\r\n'wing,' 'arm,' 'jaw,' as going in pairs; for 3 they said 'Rama,' 'fire,' or\r\n'quality,' there being considered to be three Ramas, three kinds of fire,\r\nthree qualities (guna); for 4 were used 'veda,' 'age,' or 'ocean,' there\r\nbeing four of each recognized; 'season' for 6, because they reckoned six\r\nseasons; 'sage' or 'vowel,' for 7, from the seven sages and the seven\r\nvowels; and so on with higher numbers, 'sun' for 12, because of his twelve\r\nannual denominations, or 'zodiac' from his twelve signs, and 'nail' for 20,\r\na word incidentally bringing in finger notation. As Sanskrit is very rich\r\nin synonyms, and as even the numerals themselves might be used, it became\r\nvery easy to draw up phrases or nonsense verses to record series of numbers\r\nby this system of artificial memory.\"[164]\r\n\r\nMore than enough has been said to show how baseless is the claim that all\r\nnumeral words are derived, either directly or indirectly, from the names of\r\nfingers, hands, or feet. Connected with the origin of each number word\r\nthere may be some metaphor, which cannot always be distinctly traced; and\r\nwhere the metaphor was born of the hand or of the foot, we inevitably\r\nassociate it with the practice of finger counting. But races as fond of\r\nmetaphor and of linguistic embellishment as are those of the East, or as\r\nare our American Indians even, might readily resort to some other source\r\nthan that furnished by the members of the human body, when in want of a\r\nterm with which to describe the 5, 10, or any other number of the numeral\r\nscale they were unconsciously forming. That the first numbers of a numeral\r\nscale are usually derived from other sources, we have some reason to\r\nbelieve; but that all above 2, 3, or at most 4, are almost universally of\r\ndigital origin we must admit. Exception should properly be made of higher\r\nunits, say 1000 or anything greater, which could not be expected to conform\r\nto any law of derivation governing the first few units of a system.\r\n\r\nCollecting together and comparing with one another the great mass of terms\r\nby which we find any number expressed in different languages, and, while\r\nadmitting the great diversity of method practised by different tribes, we\r\nobserve certain resemblances which were not at first supposed to exist. The\r\nvarious meanings of 1, where they can be traced at all, cluster into a\r\nlittle group of significations with which at last we come to associate the\r\nidea of unity. Similarly of 2, or 5, or 10, or any one of the little band\r\nwhich does picket duty for the advance guard of the great host of number\r\nwords which are to follow. A careful examination of the first decade\r\nwarrants the assertion that the probable meaning of any one of the units\r\nwill be found in the list given below. The words selected are intended\r\nmerely to serve as indications of the thought underlying the savage's\r\nchoice, and not necessarily as the exact term by means of which he\r\ndescribes his number. Only the commonest meanings are included in the\r\ntabulation here given.\r\n\r\n   1   = existence, piece, group, beginning.\r\n   2   = repetition, division, natural pair.\r\n   3   = collection, many, two-one.\r\n   4   = two twos.\r\n   5   = hand, group, division,\r\n   6   = five-one, two threes, second one.\r\n   7   = five-two, second two, three from ten.\r\n   8   = five-three, second three, two fours, two from ten.\r\n   9   = five-four, three threes, one from ten.\r\n  10   = one (group), two fives (hands), half a man, one man.\r\n  15   = ten-five, one foot, three fives.\r\n  20   = two tens, one man, two feet.[165]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS NUMBER BASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the development and extension of any series of numbers into a systematic\r\narrangement to which the term _system_ may be applied, the first and most\r\nindispensable step is the selection of some number which is to serve as a\r\nbase. When the savage begins the process of counting he invents, one after\r\nanother, names with which to designate the successive steps of his\r\nnumerical journey. At first there is no attempt at definiteness in the\r\ndescription he gives of any considerable number. If he cannot show what he\r\nmeans by the use of his fingers, or perhaps by the fingers of a single\r\nhand, he unhesitatingly passes it by, calling it many, heap, innumerable,\r\nas many as the leaves on the trees, or something else equally expressive\r\nand equally indefinite. But the time comes at last when a greater degree of\r\nexactness is required. Perhaps the number 11 is to be indicated, and\r\nindicated precisely. A fresh mental effort is required of the ignorant\r\nchild of nature; and the result is \"all the fingers and one more,\" \"both\r\nhands and one more,\" \"one on another count,\" or some equivalent\r\ncircumlocution. If he has an independent word for 10, the result will be\r\nsimply ten-one. When this step has been taken, the base is established. The\r\nsavage has, with entire unconsciousness, made all his subsequent progress\r\ndependent on the number 10, or, in other words, he has established 10 as\r\nthe base of his number system. The process just indicated may be gone\r\nthrough with at 5, or at 20, thus giving us a quinary or a vigesimal, or,\r\nmore probably, a mixed system; and, in rare instances, some other number\r\nmay serve as the point of departure from simple into compound numeral\r\nterms. But the general idea is always the same, and only the details of\r\nformation are found to differ.\r\n\r\nWithout the establishment of some base any _system_ of numbers is\r\nimpossible. The savage has no means of keeping track of his count unless he\r\ncan at each step refer himself to some well-defined milestone in his\r\ncourse. If, as has been pointed out in the foregoing chapters, confusion\r\nresults whenever an attempt is made to count any number which carries him\r\nabove 10, it must at once appear that progress beyond that point would be\r\nrendered many times more difficult if it were not for the fact that, at\r\neach new step, he has only to indicate the distance he has progressed\r\nbeyond his base, and not the distance from his original starting-point.\r\nSome idea may, perhaps, be gained of the nature of this difficulty by\r\nimagining the numbers of our ordinary scale to be represented, each one by\r\na single symbol different from that used to denote any other number. How\r\nlong would it take the average intellect to master the first 50 even, so\r\nthat each number could without hesitation be indicated by its appropriate\r\nsymbol? After the first 50 were once mastered, what of the next 50? and the\r\nnext? and the next? and so on. The acquisition of a scale for which we had\r\nno other means of expression than that just described would be a matter of\r\nthe extremest difficulty, and could never, save in the most exceptional\r\ncircumstances, progress beyond the attainment of a limit of a few hundred.\r\nIf the various numbers in question were designated by words instead of by\r\nsymbols, the difficulty of the task would be still further increased.\r\nHence, the establishment of some number as a base is not only a matter of\r\nthe very highest convenience, but of absolute necessity, if any save the\r\nfirst few numbers are ever to be used.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of a base,--of a number from which he makes a fresh start,\r\nand to which he refers the next steps in his count,--the savage simply\r\nfollows nature when he chooses 10, or perhaps 5 or 20. But it is a matter\r\nof the greatest interest to find that other numbers have, in exceptional\r\ncases, been used for this purpose. Two centuries ago the distinguished\r\nphilosopher and mathematician, Leibnitz, proposed a binary system of\r\nnumeration. The only symbols needed in such a system would be 0 and 1. The\r\nnumber which is now symbolized by the figure 2 would be represented by 10;\r\nwhile 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc., would appear in the binary notation as 11,\r\n100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, etc. The difficulty with such a system is that it\r\nrapidly grows cumbersome, requiring the use of so many figures for\r\nindicating any number. But Leibnitz found in the representation of all\r\nnumbers by means of the two digits 0 and 1 a fitting symbolization of the\r\ncreation out of chaos, or nothing, of the entire universe by the power of\r\nthe Deity. In commemoration of this invention a medal was struck bearing on\r\nthe obverse the words\r\n\r\n     Numero Deus impari gaudet,\r\n\r\nand on the reverse,\r\n\r\n     Omnibus ex nihilo ducendis sufficit Unum.[166]\r\n\r\nThis curious system seems to have been regarded with the greatest affection\r\nby its inventor, who used every endeavour in his power to bring it to the\r\nnotice of scholars and to urge its claims. But it appears to have been\r\nreceived with entire indifference, and to have been regarded merely as a\r\nmathematical curiosity.\r\n\r\nUnknown to Leibnitz, however, a binary method of counting actually existed\r\nduring that age; and it is only at the present time that it is becoming\r\nextinct. In Australia, the continent that is unique in its flora, its\r\nfauna, and its general topography, we find also this anomaly among methods\r\nof counting. The natives, who are to be classed among the lowest and the\r\nleast intelligent of the aboriginal races of the world, have number systems\r\nof the most rudimentary nature, and evince a decided tendency to count by\r\ntwos. This peculiarity, which was to some extent shared by the Tasmanians,\r\nthe island tribes of the Torres Straits, and other aboriginal races of that\r\nregion, has by some writers been regarded as peculiar to their part of the\r\nworld; as though a binary number system were not to be found elsewhere.\r\nThis attempt to make out of the rude and unusual method of counting which\r\nobtained among the Australians a racial characteristic is hardly justified\r\nby fuller investigation. Binary number systems, which are given in full on\r\nanother page, are found in South America. Some of the Dravidian scales are\r\nbinary;[167] and the marked preference, not infrequently observed among\r\nsavage races, for counting by pairs, is in itself a sufficient refutation\r\nof this theory. Still it is an unquestionable fact that this binary\r\ntendency is more pronounced among the Australians than among any other\r\nextensive number of kindred races. They seldom count in words above 4, and\r\nalmost never as high as 7. One of the most careful observers among them\r\nexpresses his doubt as to a native's ability to discover the loss of two\r\npins, if he were first shown seven pins in a row, and then two were removed\r\nwithout his knowledge.[168] But he believes that if a single pin were\r\nremoved from the seven, the Blackfellow would become conscious of its loss.\r\nThis is due to his habit of counting by pairs, which enables him to\r\ndiscover whether any number within reasonable limit is odd or even. Some of\r\nthe negro tribes of Africa, and of the Indian tribes of America, have the\r\nsame habit. Progression by pairs may seem to some tribes as natural as\r\nprogression by single units. It certainly is not at all rare; and in\r\nAustralia its influence on spoken number systems is most apparent.\r\n\r\nAny number system which passes the limit 10 is reasonably sure to have\r\neither a quinary, a decimal, or a vigesimal structure. A binary scale\r\ncould, as it is developed in primitive languages, hardly extend to 20, or\r\neven to 10, without becoming exceedingly cumbersome. A binary scale\r\ninevitably suggests a wretchedly low degree of mental development, which\r\nstands in the way of the formation of any number scale worthy to be\r\ndignified by the name of system. Take, for example, one of the dialects\r\nfound among the western tribes of the Torres Straits, where, in general,\r\nbut two numerals are found to exist. In this dialect the method of counting\r\nis:[169]\r\n\r\n   1.  urapun.\r\n   2.  okosa.\r\n   3.  okosa urapun = 2-1.\r\n   4.  okosa okosa  = 2-2.\r\n   5.  okosa okosa urapun = 2-2-1.\r\n   6.  okosa okosa okosa  = 2-2-2.\r\n\r\nAnything above 6 they call _ras_, a lot.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of uniformity we may speak of this as a \"system.\" But in so\r\ndoing, we give to the legitimate meaning of the word a severe strain. The\r\ncustoms and modes of life of these people are not such as to require the\r\nuse of any save the scanty list of numbers given above; and their mental\r\npoverty prompts them to call 3, the first number above a single pair, 2-1.\r\nIn the same way, 4 and 6 are respectively 2 pairs and 3 pairs, while 5 is 1\r\nmore than 2 pairs. Five objects, however, they sometimes denote by\r\n_urapuni-getal_, 1 hand. A precisely similar condition is found to prevail\r\nrespecting the arithmetic of all the Australian tribes. In some cases only\r\ntwo numerals are found, and in others three. But in a very great number of\r\nthe native languages of that continent the count proceeds by pairs, if\r\nindeed it proceeds at all. Hence we at once reject the theory that\r\nAustralian arithmetic, or Australian counting, is essentially peculiar. It\r\nis simply a legitimate result, such as might be looked for in any part of\r\nthe world, of the barbarism in which the races of that quarter of the world\r\nwere sunk, and in which they were content to live.\r\n\r\nThe following examples of Australian and Tasmanian number systems show how\r\nscanty was the numerical ability possessed by these tribes, and illustrate\r\nfully their tendency to count by twos or pairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MURRAY RIVER.[170]\r\n\r\n  1.   enea.\r\n  2.   petcheval.\r\n  3.   petchevalenea       = 2-1.\r\n  4.   petcheval peteheval = 2-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MAROURA.\r\n\r\n  1.   nukee.\r\n  2.   barkolo.\r\n  3.   barkolo nuke    = 2-1.\r\n  4.   barkolo barkolo = 2-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LAKE KOPPERAMANA.\r\n\r\n  1.   ngerna.\r\n  2.   mondroo.\r\n  3.   barkooloo.\r\n  4.   mondroo mondroo = 2-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MORT NOULAR.\r\n\r\n  1.   gamboden.\r\n  2.   bengeroo.\r\n  3.   bengeroganmel        = 2-1.\r\n  4.   bengeroovor bengeroo = 2 + 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WIMMERA.\r\n\r\n  1.   keyap.\r\n  2.   pollit.\r\n  3.   pollit keyap  = 2-1.\r\n  4.   pollit pollit = 2-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  POPHAM BAY.\r\n\r\n  1.   motu.\r\n  2.   lawitbari.\r\n  3.   lawitbari-motu = 2-1.\r\n\r\n\r\n  KAMILAROI.[171]\r\n\r\n  1.   mal.\r\n  2.   bularr.\r\n  3.   guliba.\r\n  4.   bularrbularr = 2-2.\r\n  5.   bulaguliba   = 2-3.\r\n  6.   gulibaguliba = 3-3.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PORT ESSINGTON.[172]\r\n\r\n  1.   erad.\r\n  2.   nargarik.\r\n  3.   nargarikelerad   = 2-1.\r\n  4.   nargariknargarik = 2-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WARREGO.\r\n\r\n  1.   tarlina.\r\n  2.   barkalo.\r\n  3.   tarlina barkalo = 1-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CROCKER ISLAND.\r\n\r\n  1.   roka.\r\n  2.   orialk.\r\n  3.   orialkeraroka = 2-1.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WARRIOR ISLAND.[173]\r\n\r\n  1.   woorapoo.\r\n  2.   ocasara.\r\n  3.   ocasara woorapoo = 2-1.\r\n  4.   ocasara ocasara  = 2-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DIPPIL.[174]\r\n\r\n  1.   kalim.\r\n  2.   buller.\r\n  3.   boppa.\r\n  4.   buller gira buller       = 2 + 2.\r\n  5.   buller gira buller kalim = 2 + 2 + 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FRAZER'S ISLAND.[175]\r\n\r\n  1.   kalim.\r\n  2.   bulla.\r\n  3.   goorbunda.\r\n  4.   bulla-bulla = 2-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MORETON'S BAY.[176]\r\n\r\n  1.   kunner.\r\n  2.   budela.\r\n  3.   muddan.\r\n  4.   budela berdelu = 2-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ENCOUNTER BAY.[177]\r\n\r\n  1.   yamalaitye.\r\n  2.   ningenk.\r\n  3.   nepaldar.\r\n  4.   kuko kuko         = 2-2, or pair pair.\r\n  5.   kuko kuko ki      = 2-2-1.\r\n  6.   kuko kuko kuko    = 2-2-2.\r\n  7.   kuko kuko kuko ki = 2-2-2-1.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ADELAIDE.[178]\r\n\r\n  1.   kuma.\r\n  2.   purlaitye, or bula.\r\n  3.   marnkutye.\r\n  4.   yera-bula           = pair 2.\r\n  5.   yera-bula kuma      = pair 2-1.\r\n  6.   yera-bula purlaitye = pair 2.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WIRADUROI.[179]\r\n\r\n  1.   numbai.\r\n  2.   bula.\r\n  3.   bula-numbai = 2-1.\r\n  4.   bungu       = many.\r\n  5.   bungu-galan = very many.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WIRRI-WIRRI.[180]\r\n\r\n  1.   mooray.\r\n  2.   boollar.\r\n  3.   belar mooray    = 2-1.\r\n  4.   boollar boollar = 2-2.\r\n  5.   mongoonballa.\r\n  6.   mongun mongun.\r\n\r\n\r\n  COOPER'S CREEK.[181]\r\n\r\n  1.   goona.\r\n  2.   barkoola.\r\n  3.   barkoola goona    = 2-1.\r\n  4.   barkoola barkoola = 2-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOURKE, DARLING RIVER.[182]\r\n\r\n  1.   neecha.\r\n  2.   boolla.\r\n  4.   boolla neecha = 2-1.\r\n  3.   boolla boolla = 2-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MURRAY RIVER, N.W.

Nearly all\r\nof them show a structure too clearly marked to require comment. In a few\r\ncases, however, the systems are to be regarded rather as showing a trace of\r\nbinary structure, than as perfect examples of counting by twos. Examples of\r\nthis nature are especially numerous in Curr's extensive list--the most\r\ncomplete collection of Australian vocabularies ever made.\r\n\r\nA few binary scales have been found in South America, but they show no\r\nimportant variation on the Australian systems cited above.

Such scales\r\nactually exist, though not in such numbers as the binary. An example of the\r\nformer is the Betoya scale,[195] which runs thus:\r\n\r\n  1.   edoyoyoi.\r\n  2.   edoi           = another.\r\n  3.   ibutu          = beyond.\r\n  4.   ibutu-edoyoyoi = beyond 1, or 3-1.\r\n  5.   ru-mocoso      = hand.\r\n\r\nThe Kamilaroi scale, given as an example of binary formation, is partly\r\nternary; and its word for 6, _guliba guliba_, 3-3, is purely ternary. An\r\noccasional ternary trace is also found in number systems otherwise decimal\r\nor quinary vigesimal; as the _dlkunoutl_, second 3, of the Haida Indians of\r\nBritish Columbia. The Karens of India[196] in a system otherwise strictly\r\ndecimal, exhibit the following binary-ternary-quaternary vagary:\r\n\r\n  6.   then tho    = 3 × 2.\r\n  7.   then tho ta = 3 × 2-1.\r\n  8.   lwie tho    = 4 × 2.\r\n  9.   lwie tho ta = 4 × 2-1.\r\n\r\nIn the Wokka dialect,[197] found on the Burnett River, Australia, a single\r\nternary numeral is found, thus:\r\n\r\n  1.   karboon.\r\n  2.   wombura.\r\n  3.   chrommunda.\r\n  4.   chrommuda karboon = 3-1.\r\n\r\nInstances of quaternary numeration are less rare than are those of ternary,\r\nand there is reason to believe that this method of counting has been\r\npractised more extensively than any other, except the binary and the three\r\nnatural methods, the quinary, the decimal, and the vigesimal. The number of\r\nfingers on one hand is, excluding the thumb, four. Possibly there have been\r\ntribes among which counting by fours arose as a legitimate, though unusual,\r\nresult of finger counting; just as there are, now and then, individuals who\r\ncount on their fingers with the forefinger as a starting-point. But no such\r\npractice has ever been observed among savages, and such theorizing is the\r\nmerest guess-work. Still a definite tendency to count by fours is sometimes\r\nmet with, whatever be its origin. Quaternary traces are repeatedly to be\r\nfound among the Indian languages of British Columbia. In describing the\r\nColumbians, Bancroft says: \"Systems of numeration are simple, proceeding by\r\nfours, fives, or tens, according to the different languages....\"[198] The\r\nsame preference for four is said to have existed in primitive times in the\r\nlanguages of Central Asia, and that this form of numeration, resulting in\r\nscores of 16 and 64, was a development of finger counting.[199]\r\n\r\nIn the Hawaiian and a few other languages of the islands of the central\r\nPacific, where in general the number systems employed are decimal, we find\r\na most interesting case of the development, within number scales already\r\nwell established, of both binary and quaternary systems. Their origin seems\r\nto have been perfectly natural, but the systems themselves must have been\r\nperfected very slowly. In Tahitian, Rarotongan, Mangarevan, and other\r\ndialects found in the neighbouring islands of those southern latitudes,\r\ncertain of the higher units, _tekau_, _rau_, _mano_, which originally\r\nsignified 10, 100, 1000, have become doubled in value, and now stand for\r\n20, 200, 2000. In Hawaiian and other dialects they have again been doubled,\r\nand there they stand for 40, 400, 4000.[200] In the Marquesas group both\r\nforms are found, the former in the southern, the latter in the northern,\r\npart of the archipelago; and it seems probable that one or both of these\r\nmethods of numeration are scattered somewhat widely throughout that region.\r\nThe origin of these methods is probably to be found in the fact that, after\r\nthe migration from the west toward the east, nearly all the objects the\r\nnatives would ever count in any great numbers were small,--as yams,\r\ncocoanuts, fish, etc.,--and would be most conveniently counted by pairs.\r\nHence the native, as he counted one pair, two pairs, etc., might readily\r\nsay _one_, _two_, and so on, omitting the word \"pair\" altogether. Having\r\nmuch more frequent occasion to employ this secondary than the primary\r\nmeaning of his numerals, the native would easily allow the original\r\nsignifications to fall into disuse, and in the lapse of time to be entirely\r\nforgotten. With a subsequent migration to the northward a second\r\nduplication might take place, and so produce the singular effect of giving\r\nto the same numeral word three different meanings in different parts of\r\nOceania. To illustrate the former or binary method of numeration, the\r\nTahuatan, one of the southern dialects of the Marquesas group, may be\r\nemployed.[201] Here the ordinary numerals are:\r\n\r\n          1.  tahi,\r\n         10.  onohuu.\r\n         20.  takau.\r\n        200.  au.\r\n      2,000.  mano.\r\n     20,000.  tini.\r\n     20,000.  tufa.\r\n  2,000,000.  pohi.\r\n\r\nIn counting fish, and all kinds of fruit, except breadfruit, the scale\r\nbegins with _tauna_, pair, and then, omitting _onohuu_, they employ the\r\nsame words again, but in a modified sense. _Takau_ becomes 10, _au_ 100,\r\netc.; but as the word \"pair\" is understood in each case, the value is the\r\nsame as before. The table formed on this basis would be:\r\n\r\n   2 (units) = 1 tauna = 2.\r\n  10 tauna   = 1 takau = 20.\r\n  10 takau   = 1 au    = 200.\r\n  10 au      = 1 mano  = 2000.\r\n  10 mano    = 1 tini  = 20,000.\r\n  10 tini    = 1 tufa  = 200,000.\r\n  10 tufa    = 1 pohi  = 2,000,000.\r\n\r\nFor counting breadfruit they use _pona_, knot, as their unit, breadfruit\r\nusually being tied up in knots of four. _Takau_ now takes its third\r\nsignification, 40, and becomes the base of their breadfruit system, so to\r\nspeak. For some unknown reason the next unit, 400, is expressed by _tauau_,\r\nwhile _au_, which is the term that would regularly stand for that number,\r\nhas, by a second duplication, come to signify 800. The next unit, _mano_,\r\nhas in a similar manner been twisted out of its original sense, and in\r\ncounting breadfruit is made to serve for 8000. In the northern, or\r\nNukuhivan Islands, the decimal-quaternary system is more regular. It is in\r\nthe counting of breadfruit only,[202]\r\n\r\n   4 breadfruits = 1 pona = 4.\r\n  10 pona        = 1 toha = 40.\r\n  10 toha        = 1 au   = 400.\r\n  10 au          = 1 mano = 4000.\r\n  10 mano        = 1 tini = 40,000.\r\n  10 tini        = 1 tufa = 400,000.\r\n  10 tufa        = 1 pohi = 4,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn the Hawaiian dialect this scale is, with slight modification, the\r\nuniversal scale, used not only in counting breadfruit, but any other\r\nobjects as well. The result is a complete decimal-quaternary system, such\r\nas is found nowhere else in the world except in this and a few of the\r\nneighbouring dialects of the Pacific. This scale, which is almost identical\r\nwith the Nukuhivan, is[203]\r\n\r\n   4 units  = 1 ha or tauna = 4.\r\n  10 tauna  = 1 tanaha      = 40.\r\n  10 tanaha = 1 lau         = 400.\r\n  10 lau    = 1 mano        = 4000.\r\n  10 mano   = 1 tini        = 40,000.\r\n  10 tini   = 1 lehu        = 400,000.\r\n\r\nThe quaternary element thus introduced has modified the entire structure of\r\nthe Hawaiian number system. Fifty is _tanaha me ta umi_, 40 + 10; 76 is 40\r\n+ 20 + 10  + 6; 100 is _ua tanaha ma tekau_, 2 × 40 + 10; 200 is _lima\r\ntanaha_, 5 × 40; and 864,895 is 2 × 400,000 + 40,000 + 6 × 4000 + 2 × 400 +\r\n2 × 40 + 10 + 5.[204] Such examples show that this secondary influence,\r\nentering and incorporating itself as a part of a well-developed decimal\r\nsystem, has radically changed it by the establishment of 4 as the primary\r\nnumber base. The role which 10 now plays is peculiar. In the natural\r\nformation of a quaternary scale new units would be introduced at 16, 64,\r\n256, etc.; that is, at the square, the cube, and each successive power of\r\nthe base. But, instead of this, the new units are introduced at 10 × 4, 100\r\n× 4, 1000 × 4, etc.; that is, at the products of 4 by each successive power\r\nof the old base. This leaves the scale a decimal scale still, even while it\r\nmay justly be called quaternary; and produces one of the most singular and\r\ninteresting instances of number-system formation that has ever been\r\nobserved. In this connection it is worth noting that these Pacific island\r\nnumber scales have been developed to very high limits--in some cases into\r\nthe millions. The numerals for these large numbers do not seem in any way\r\nindefinite, but rather to convey to the mind of the native an idea as clear\r\nas can well be conveyed by numbers of such magnitude. Beyond the limits\r\ngiven, the islanders have indefinite expressions, but as far as can be\r\nascertained these are only used when the limits given above have actually\r\nbeen passed. To quote one more example, the Hervey Islanders, who have a\r\nbinary-decimal scale, count as follows:\r\n\r\n   5 kaviri (bunches of cocoanuts) = 1 takau = 20.\r\n  10 takau                         = 1 rau   = 200.\r\n  10 rau                           = 1 mano  = 2000.\r\n  10 mano                          = 1 kiu   = 20,000.\r\n  10 kiu                           = 1 tini  = 200,000.\r\n\r\nAnything above this they speak of in an uncertain way, as _mano mano_ or\r\n_tini tini_, which may, perhaps, be paralleled by our English phrases\r\n\"myriads upon myriads,\" and \"millions of millions.\"[205] It is most\r\nremarkable that the same quarter of the globe should present us with the\r\nstunted number sense of the Australians, and, side by side with it, so\r\nextended and intelligent an appreciation of numerical values as that\r\npossessed by many of the lesser tribes of Polynesia.\r\n\r\nThe Luli of Paraguay[206] show a decided preference for the base 4. This\r\npreference gives way only when they reach the number 10, which is an\r\nordinary digit numeral. All numbers above that point belong rather to\r\ndecimal than to quaternary numeration. Their numerals are:\r\n\r\n   1.  alapea.\r\n   2.  tamop.\r\n   3.  tamlip.\r\n   4.  lokep.\r\n   5.  lokep moile alapea = 4 with 1,\r\n        or is-alapea      = hand 1.\r\n   6.  lokep moile tamop  = 4 with 2.\r\n   7.  lokep moile tamlip = 4 with 3.\r\n   8.  lokep moile lokep  = 4 with 4.\r\n   9.  lokep moile lokep alapea = 4 with 4-1.\r\n  10.  is yaoum = all the fingers of hand.\r\n  11.  is yaoum moile alapea = all the fingers of hand with 1.\r\n  20.  is elu yaoum = all the fingers of hand and foot.\r\n  30.  is elu yaoum moile is-yaoum = all the fingers of hand and foot with\r\n                                     all the fingers of hand.\r\n\r\nStill another instance of quaternary counting, this time carrying with it a\r\nsuggestion of binary influence, is furnished by the Mocobi[207] of the\r\nParana region. Their scale is exceedingly rude, and they use the fingers\r\nand toes almost exclusively in counting; only using their spoken numerals\r\nwhen, for any reason, they wish to dispense with the aid of their hands and\r\nfeet. Their first eight numerals are:\r\n\r\n   1.  iniateda.\r\n   2.  inabaca.\r\n   3.  inabacao caini   = 2 above.\r\n   4.  inabacao cainiba = 2 above 2;\r\n        or natolatata.\r\n   5.  inibacao cainiba iniateda = 2 above 2-1;\r\n        or natolatata iniateda   = 4-1.\r\n   6.  natolatatata inibaca      = 4-2.\r\n   7.  natolata inibacao-caini   = 4-2 above.\r\n   8.  natolata-natolata         = 4-4.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no recorded instance of a number system formed on 6, 7,\r\n8, or 9 as a base. No natural reason exists for the choice of any of these\r\nnumbers for such a purpose; and it is hardly conceivable that any race\r\nshould proceed beyond the unintelligent binary or quaternary stage, and\r\nthen begin the formation of a scale for counting with any other base than\r\none of the three natural bases to which allusion has already been made. Now\r\nand then some anomalous fragment is found imbedded in an otherwise regular\r\nsystem, which carries us back to the time when the savage was groping his\r\nway onward in his attempt to give expression to some number greater than\r\nany he had ever used before; and now and then one of these fragments is\r\nsuch as to lead us to the border land of the might-have-been, and to cause\r\nus to speculate on the possibility of so great a numerical curiosity as a\r\nsenary or a septenary scale. The Bretons call 18 _triouec'h_, 3-6, but\r\notherwise their language contains no hint of counting by sixes; and we are\r\nleft at perfect liberty to theorize at will on the existence of so unusual\r\na number word. Pott remarks[208] that the Bolans, of western Africa, appear\r\nto make some use of 6 as their number base, but their system, taken as a\r\nwhole, is really a quinary-decimal. The language of the Sundas,[209] or\r\nmountaineers of Java, contains traces of senary counting. The Akra words\r\nfor 7 and 8, _paggu_ and _paniu_, appear to mean 6-1 and 7-1, respectively;\r\nand the same is true of the corresponding Tambi words _pagu_ and\r\n_panjo_.[210] The Watji tribe[211] call 6 _andee_, and 7 _anderee_, which\r\nprobably means 6-1. These words are to be regarded as accidental variations\r\non the ordinary laws of formation, and are no more significant of a desire\r\nto count by sixes than is the Wallachian term _deu-maw_, which expresses 18\r\nas 2-9, indicates the existence of a scale of which 9 is the base. One\r\nremarkably interesting number system is that exhibited by the Mosquito\r\ntribe[212] of Central America, who possess an extensive quinary-vigesimal\r\nscale containing one binary and three senary compounds. The first ten words\r\nof this singular scale, which has already been quoted, are:\r\n\r\n   1.  kumi.\r\n   2.  wal.\r\n   3.  niupa.\r\n   4.  wal-wal  = 2-2.\r\n   5.  mata-sip = fingers of one hand.\r\n   6.  matlalkabe.\r\n   7.  matlalkabe pura kumi  = 6 + 1.\r\n   8.  matlalkabe pura wal   = 6 + 2.\r\n   9.  matlalkabe pura niupa = 6 + 3.\r\n  10.  mata-wal-sip = fingers of the second hand.\r\n\r\nIn passing from 6 to 7, this tribe, also, has varied the almost universal\r\nlaw of progression, and has called 7 6-1. Their 8 and 9 are formed in a\r\nsimilar manner; but at 10 the ordinary method is resumed, and is continued\r\nfrom that point onward. Few number systems contain as many as three\r\nnumerals which are associated with 6 as their base. In nearly all instances\r\nwe find such numerals singly, or at most in pairs; and in the structure of\r\nany system as a whole, they are of no importance whatever. For example, in\r\nthe Pawnee, a pure decimal scale, we find the following odd sequence:[213]\r\n\r\n   6.  shekshabish.\r\n   7.  petkoshekshabish = 2-6, _i.e._ 2d 6.\r\n   8.  touwetshabish    = 3-6, _i.e._ 3d 6.\r\n   9.  loksherewa       = 10 - 1.\r\n\r\nIn the Uainuma scale the expressions for 7 and 8 are obviously referred to\r\n6, though the meaning of 7 is not given, and it is impossible to guess what\r\nit really does signify. The numerals in question are:[214]\r\n\r\n   6.  aira-ettagapi.\r\n   7.  aira-ettagapi-hairiwigani-apecapecapsi.\r\n   8.  aira-ettagapi-matschahma = 6 + 2.\r\n\r\nIn the dialect of the Mille tribe a single trace of senary counting\r\nappears, as the numerals given below show:[215]\r\n\r\n   6.  dildjidji.\r\n   7.  dildjidji me djuun = 6 + 1.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the numerals used by the natives of the Marshall Islands, the\r\nfollowing curiously irregular sequence also contains a single senary\r\nnumeral:[216]\r\n\r\n   6.  thil thino       = 3 + 3.\r\n   7.  thilthilim-thuon = 6 + 1.\r\n   8.  rua-li-dok       = 10 - 2.\r\n   9.  ruathim-thuon    = 10 - 2 + 1.\r\n\r\nMany years ago a statement appeared which at once attracted attention and\r\nawakened curiosity. It was to the effect that the Maoris, the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants of New Zealand, used as the basis of their numeral system the\r\nnumber 11; and that the system was quite extensively developed, having\r\nsimple words for 121 and 1331, _i.e._ for the square and cube of 11. No\r\napparent reason existed for this anomaly, and the Maori scale was for a\r\nlong time looked upon as something quite exceptional and outside all\r\nordinary rules of number-system formation. But a closer and more accurate\r\nknowledge of the Maori language and customs served to correct the mistake,\r\nand to show that this system was a simple decimal system, and that the\r\nerror arose from the following habit. Sometimes when counting a number of\r\nobjects the Maoris would put aside 1 to represent each 10, and then those\r\nso set aside would afterward be counted to ascertain the number of tens in\r\nthe heap. Early observers among this people, seeing them count 10 and then\r\nset aside 1, at the same time pronouncing the word _tekau_, imagined that\r\nthis word meant 11, and that the ignorant savage was making use of this\r\nnumber as his base. This misconception found its way into the early New\r\nZealand dictionary, but was corrected in later editions. It is here\r\nmentioned only because of the wide diffusion of the error, and the interest\r\nit has always excited.[217]\r\n\r\nAside from our common decimal scale, there exist in the English language\r\nother methods of counting, some of them formal enough to be dignified by\r\nthe term _system_--as the sexagesimal method of measuring time and angular\r\nmagnitude; and the duodecimal system of reckoning, so extensively used in\r\nbuying and selling. Of these systems, other than decimal, two are noticed\r\nby Tylor,[218] and commented on at some length, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"One is the well-known dicing set, _ace_, _deuce_, _tray_, _cater_,\r\n_cinque_, _size_; thus _size-ace_ is 6-1, _cinques_ or _sinks_, double 5.\r\nThese came to us from France, and correspond with the common French\r\nnumerals, except _ace_, which is Latin _as_, a word of great philological\r\ninterest, meaning 'one.' The other borrowed set is to be found in the\r\n_Slang Dictionary_. It appears that the English street-folk have adopted as\r\na means of secret communication a set of Italian numerals from the\r\norgan-grinders and image-sellers, or by other ways through which Italian or\r\nLingua Franca is brought into the low neighbourhoods of London. In so doing\r\nthey have performed a philological operation not only curious but\r\ninstructive. By copying such expressions as _due soldi_, _tre soldi_, as\r\nequivalent to 'twopence,' 'threepence,' the word _saltee_ became a\r\nrecognized slang term for 'penny'; and pence are reckoned as follows:\r\n\r\n  oney saltee                              1d.  uno soldo.\r\n  dooe saltee                              2d.  due soldi.\r\n  tray saltee                              3d.  tre soldi.\r\n  quarterer saltee                         4d.  quattro soldi.\r\n  chinker saltee                           5d.  cinque soldi.\r\n  say saltee                               6d.  sei soldi.\r\n  say oney saltee, or setter saltee        7d.  sette soldi.\r\n  say dooe saltee, or otter saltee         8d.  otto soldi.\r\n  say tray saltee, or nobba saltee         9d.  nove soldi.\r\n  say quarterer saltee, or dacha saltee   10d. dieci soldi.\r\n  say chinker saltee or dacha oney saltee 11d. undici soldi.\r\n  oney beong                               1s.\r\n  a beong say saltee                       1s. 6d.\r\n  dooe beong say saltee, or madza caroon   2s. 6d. (half-crown, mezza\r\n                                               corona).\r\n\r\nOne of these series simply adopts Italian numerals decimally. But the\r\nother, when it has reached 6, having had enough of novelty, makes 7 by 6-1,\r\nand so forth. It is for no abstract reason that 6 is thus made the\r\nturning-point, but simply because the costermonger is adding pence up to\r\nthe silver sixpence, and then adding pence again up to the shilling. Thus\r\nour duodecimal coinage has led to the practice of counting by sixes, and\r\nproduced a philological curiosity, a real senary notation.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the two methods of counting here alluded to, another may be\r\nmentioned, which is equally instructive as showing how readily any special\r\nmethod of reckoning may be developed out of the needs arising in connection\r\nwith any special line of work. As is well known, it is the custom in ocean,\r\nlake, and river navigation to measure soundings by the fathom. On the\r\nMississippi River, where constant vigilance is needed because of the rapid\r\nshifting of sand-bars, a special sounding nomenclature has come into\r\nvogue,[219] which the following terms will illustrate:\r\n\r\n   5     ft. = five feet.\r\n   6     ft. = six feet.\r\n   9     ft. = nine feet.\r\n  10-1/2 ft. = a quarter less twain; _i.e._ a quarter of a fathom less than 2.\r\n  12     ft. = mark twain.\r\n  13-1/2 ft. = a quarter twain.\r\n  16-1/2 ft. = a quarter less three.\r\n  18     ft. = mark three.\r\n  19-1/2 ft. = a quarter three.\r\n  24     ft. = deep four.\r\n\r\nAs the soundings are taken, the readings are called off in the manner\r\nindicated in the table; 10-1/2 feet being \"a quarter less twain,\" 12 feet\r\n\"mark twain,\" etc. Any sounding above \"deep four\" is reported as \"no\r\nbottom.\" In the Atlantic and Gulf waters on the coast of this country the\r\nsame system prevails, only it is extended to meet the requirements of the\r\ndeeper soundings there found, and instead of \"six feet,\" \"mark twain,\"\r\netc., we find the fuller expressions, \"by the mark one,\" \"by the mark two,\"\r\nand so on, as far as the depth requires. This example also suggests the\r\nolder and far more widely diffused method of reckoning time at sea by\r\nbells; a system in which \"one bell,\" \"two bells,\" \"three bells,\" etc., mark\r\nthe passage of time for the sailor as distinctly as the hands of the clock\r\ncould do it. Other examples of a similar nature will readily suggest\r\nthemselves to the mind.\r\n\r\nTwo possible number systems that have, for purely theoretical reasons,\r\nattracted much attention, are the octonary and the duodecimal systems. In\r\nfavour of the octonary system it is urged that 8 is an exact power of 2; or\r\nin other words, a large number of repeated halves can be taken with 8 as a\r\nstarting-point, without producing a fractional result. With 8 as a base we\r\nshould obtain by successive halvings, 4, 2, 1. A similar process in our\r\ndecimal scale gives 5, 2-1/2, 1-1/4. All this is undeniably true, but,\r\ngranting the argument up to this point, one is then tempted to ask \"What of\r\nit?\" A certain degree of simplicity would thereby be introduced into the\r\nTheory of Numbers; but the only persons sufficiently interested in this\r\nbranch of mathematics to appreciate the benefit thus obtained are already\r\ntrained mathematicians, who are concerned rather with the pure science\r\ninvolved, than with reckoning on any special base. A slightly increased\r\nsimplicity would appear in the work of stockbrokers, and others who reckon\r\nextensively by quarters, eighths, and sixteenths. But such men experience\r\nno difficulty whatever in performing their mental computations in the\r\ndecimal system; and they acquire through constant practice such quickness\r\nand accuracy of calculation, that it is difficult to see how octonary\r\nreckoning would materially assist them. Altogether, the reasons that have\r\nin the past been adduced in favour of this form of arithmetic seem trivial.\r\nThere is no record of any tribe that ever counted by eights, nor is there\r\nthe slightest likelihood that such a system could ever meet with any\r\ngeneral favour. It is said that the ancient Saxons used the octonary\r\nsystem,[220] but how, or for what purposes, is not stated. It is not to be\r\nsupposed that this was the common system of counting, for it is well known\r\nthat the decimal scale was in use as far back as the evidence of language\r\nwill take us. But the field of speculation into which one is led by the\r\noctonary scale has proved most attractive to some, and the conclusion has\r\nbeen soberly reached, that in the history of the Aryan race the octonary\r\nwas to be regarded as the predecessor of the decimal scale. In support of\r\nthis theory no direct evidence is brought forward, but certain verbal\r\nresemblances. Those ignes fatuii of the philologist are made to perform\r\nthe duty of supporting an hypothesis which would never have existed but\r\nfor their own treacherous suggestions. Here is one of the most attractive\r\nof them:\r\n\r\nBetween the Latin words _novus_, new, and _novem_, nine, there exists a\r\nresemblance so close that it may well be more than accidental. Nine is,\r\nthen, the _new_ number; that is, the first number on a new count, of which\r\n8 must originally have been the base. Pursuing this thought by\r\ninvestigation into different languages, the same resemblance is found\r\nthere. Hence the theory is strengthened by corroborative evidence. In\r\nlanguage after language the same resemblance is found, until it seems\r\nimpossible to doubt, that in prehistoric times, 9 _was_ the new number--the\r\nbeginning of a second tale. The following table will show how widely spread\r\nis this coincidence:\r\n\r\n  Sanskrit,   navan = 9.          nava = new.\r\n  Persian,    nuh = 9.            nau  = new.\r\n  Greek,      [Greek: ennea] = 9. [Greek: neos] = new.\r\n  Latin,      novem = 9.          novus = new.\r\n  German,     neun = 9.           neu  = new.\r\n  Swedish,    nio = 9.            ny   = new.\r\n  Dutch,      negen = 9.          nieuw = new.\r\n  Danish,     ni = 9.             ny   = new.\r\n  Icelandic,  nyr = 9.            niu  = new.\r\n  English,    nine = 9.           new  = new.\r\n  French,     neuf = 9.           nouveau = new.\r\n  Spanish,    nueve = 9.          neuvo = new.\r\n  Italian,    nove = 9.           nuovo = new.\r\n  Portuguese, nove = 9.           novo = new.\r\n  Irish,      naoi = 9.           nus  = new.\r\n  Welsh,      naw = 9.            newydd = new.\r\n  Breton,     nevez = 9.          nuhue = new.[221]\r\n\r\nThis table might be extended still further, but the above examples show how\r\nwidely diffused throughout the Aryan languages is this resemblance. The\r\nlist certainly is an impressive one, and the student is at first thought\r\ntempted to ask whether all these resemblances can possibly have been\r\naccidental. But a single consideration sweeps away the entire argument as\r\nthough it were a cobweb. All the languages through which this verbal\r\nlikeness runs are derived directly or indirectly from one common stock; and\r\nthe common every-day words, \"nine\" and \"new,\" have been transmitted from\r\nthat primitive tongue into all these linguistic offspring with but little\r\nchange. Not only are the two words in question akin in each individual\r\nlanguage, but _they are akin in all the languages_. Hence all these\r\nresemblances reduce to a single resemblance, or perhaps identity, that\r\nbetween the Aryan words for \"nine\" and \"new.\" This was probably an\r\naccidental resemblance, no more significant than any one of the scores of\r\nother similar cases occurring in every language. If there were any further\r\nevidence of the former existence of an Aryan octonary scale, the\r\ncoincidence would possess a certain degree of significance; but not a shred\r\nhas ever been produced which is worthy of consideration. If our remote\r\nancestors ever counted by eights, we are entirely ignorant of the fact, and\r\nmust remain so until much more is known of their language than scholars now\r\nhave at their command. The word resemblances noted above are hardly more\r\nsignificant than those occurring in two Polynesian languages, the Fatuhivan\r\nand the Nakuhivan,[222] where \"new\" is associated with the number 7. In the\r\nformer case 7 is _fitu_, and \"new\" is _fou_; in the latter 7 is _hitu_, and\r\n\"new\" is _hou_. But no one has, because of this likeness, ever suggested\r\nthat these tribes ever counted by the senary method. Another equally\r\ntrivial resemblance occurs in the Tawgy and the Kamassin languages,[223]\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\r\n  TAWGY.                               KAMASSIN.\r\n\r\n  8.   siti-data   = 2 × 4.            8.   sin-the'de = 2 × 4.\r\n  9.   nameaitjuma = another.          9.   amithun    = another.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it would be childish to argue, from this fact alone, that either 4 or 8\r\nwas the number base used.\r\n\r\nIn a recent antiquarian work of considerable interest, the author examines\r\ninto the question of a former octonary system of counting among the various\r\nraces of the world, particularly those of Asia, and brings to light much\r\ncurious and entertaining material respecting the use of this number. Its\r\nuse and importance in China, India, and central Asia, as well as among some\r\nof the islands of the Pacific, and in Central America, leads him to the\r\nconclusion that there was a time, long before the beginning of recorded\r\nhistory, when 8 was the common number base of the world. But his conclusion\r\nhas no basis in his own material even. The argument cannot be examined\r\nhere, but any one who cares to investigate it can find there an excellent\r\nillustration of the fact that a pet theory may take complete possession of\r\nits originator, and reduce him finally to a state of infantile\r\nsubjugation.[224]\r\n\r\nOf all numbers upon which a system could be based, 12 seems to combine in\r\nitself the greatest number of advantages. It is capable of division by 2,\r\n3, 4, and 6, and hence admits of the taking of halves, thirds, quarters,\r\nand sixths of itself without the introduction of fractions in the result.\r\nFrom a commercial stand-point this advantage is very great; so great that\r\nmany have seriously advocated the entire abolition of the decimal scale,\r\nand the substitution of the duodecimal in its stead. It is said that\r\nCharles XII. of Sweden was actually contemplating such a change in his\r\ndominions at the time of his death. In pursuance of this idea, some writers\r\nhave gone so far as to suggest symbols for 10 and 11, and to recast our\r\nentire numeral nomenclature to conform to the duodecimal base.[225] Were\r\nsuch a change made, we should express the first nine numbers as at present,\r\n10 and 11 by new, single symbols, and 12 by 10. From this point the\r\nprogression would be regular, as in the decimal scale--only the same\r\ncombination of figures in the different scales would mean very different\r\nthings. Thus, 17 in the decimal scale would become 15 in the duodecimal;\r\n144 in the decimal would become 100 in the duodecimal; and 1728, the cube\r\nof the new base, would of course be represented by the figures 1000.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that any such change can ever meet with general or even\r\npartial favour, so firmly has the decimal scale become intrenched in its\r\nposition. But it is more than probable that a large part of the world of\r\ntrade and commerce will continue to buy and sell by the dozen, the gross,\r\nor some multiple or fraction of the one or the other, as long as buying and\r\nselling shall continue. Such has been its custom for centuries, and such\r\nwill doubtless be its custom for centuries to come. The duodecimal is not a\r\nnatural scale in the same sense as are the quinary, the decimal, and the\r\nvigesimal; but it is a system which is called into being long after the\r\ncomplete development of one of the natural systems, solely because of the\r\nsimple and familiar fractions into which its base is divided. It is the\r\nscale of civilization, just as the three common scales are the scales of\r\nnature. But an example of its use was long sought for in vain among the\r\nprimitive races of the world. Humboldt, in commenting on the number systems\r\nof the various peoples he had visited during his travels, remarked that no\r\nrace had ever used exclusively that best of bases, 12. But it has recently\r\nbeen announced[226] that the discovery of such a tribe had actually been\r\nmade, and that the Aphos of Benuë, an African tribe, count to 12 by simple\r\nwords, and then for 13 say 12-1, for 14, 12-2, etc. This report has yet to\r\nbe verified, but if true it will constitute a most interesting addition to\r\nanthropological knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE QUINARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the quinary mode of counting has been discussed with some\r\nfulness in a preceding chapter, and upon that question but little more need\r\nbe said. It is the first of the natural systems. When the savage has\r\nfinished his count of the fingers of a single hand, he has reached this\r\nnatural number base. At this point he ceases to use simple numbers, and\r\nbegins the process of compounding. By some one of the numerous methods\r\nillustrated in earlier chapters, he passes from 5 to 10, using here the\r\nfingers of his second hand. He now has two fives; and, just as we say\r\n\"twenty,\" _i.e._ two tens, he says \"two hands,\" \"the second hand finished,\"\r\n\"all the fingers,\" \"the fingers of both hands,\" \"all the fingers come to an\r\nend,\" or, much more rarely, \"one man.\" That is, he is, in one of the many\r\nways at his command, saying \"two fives.\" At 15 he has \"three hands\" or \"one\r\nfoot\"; and at 20 he pauses with \"four hands,\" \"hands and feet,\" \"both\r\nfeet,\" \"all the fingers of hands and feet,\" \"hands and feet finished,\" or,\r\nmore probably, \"one man.\" All these modes of expression are strictly\r\nnatural, and all have been found in the number scales which were, and in\r\nmany cases still are, in daily use among the uncivilized races of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn its structure the quinary is the simplest, the most primitive, of the\r\nnatural systems. Its base is almost always expressed by a word meaning\r\n\"hand,\" or by some equivalent circumlocution, and its digital origin is\r\nusually traced without difficulty. A consistent formation would require the\r\nexpression of 10 by some phrase meaning \"two fives,\" 15 by \"three fives,\"\r\netc. Such a scale is the one obtained from the Betoya language, already\r\nmentioned in Chapter III., where the formation of the numerals is purely\r\nquinary, as the following indicate:[227]\r\n\r\n   5.  teente = 1 hand.\r\n  10.  cayaente, or caya huena = 2 hands.\r\n  15.  toazumba-ente = 3 hands.\r\n  20.  caesa-ente    = 4 hands.\r\n\r\nThe same formation appears, with greater or less distinctness, in many of\r\nthe quinary scales already quoted, and in many more of which mention might\r\nbe made. Collecting the significant numerals from a few such scales, and\r\ntabulating them for the sake of convenience of comparison, we see this\r\npoint clearly illustrated by the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  TAMANAC.\r\n\r\n   5.  amnaitone = 1 hand.\r\n  10.  amna atse ponare = 2 hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ARAWAK, GUIANA.\r\n\r\n   5.  abba tekkabe  = 1 hand.\r\n  10.  biamantekkabe = 2 hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  JIVIRO.\r\n\r\n   5.  alacötegladu = 1 hand.\r\n  10.  catögladu    = 2 hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NIAM NIAM\r\n\r\n   5.  biswe\r\n  10.  bauwe = 2d 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NENGONES\r\n\r\n   5.  se dono       = the end (of the fingers of 1 hand).\r\n  10.  rewe tubenine = 2 series (of fingers).\r\n\r\n\r\n  SESAKE.[228]\r\n\r\n   5.  lima     = hand.\r\n  10.  dua lima = 2 hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AMBRYM.[229]\r\n\r\n   5.  lim    = hand.\r\n  10.  ra-lim = 2 hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PAMA.[229]\r\n\r\n   5.  e-lime     = hand.\r\n  10.  ha-lua-lim = the 2 hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DINKA.[230]\r\n\r\n   5.  wdyets.\r\n  10.  wtyer, or wtyar = 5 × 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BARI\r\n\r\n   5.  kanat\r\n  10.  puök = 5 + 5?\r\n\r\n\r\n  KANURI\r\n\r\n   5.  ugu.\r\n  10.  megu = 2 × 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RIO NORTE AND SAN ANTONIO.[231]\r\n\r\n   5.  juyopamauj.\r\n  10.  juyopamauj ajte = 5 × 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  API.[232]\r\n\r\n   5.  lima.\r\n  10.  lua-lima = 2 × 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ERROMANGO\r\n\r\n   5.  suku-rim.\r\n  10.  nduru-lim = 2 × 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TLINGIT, BRITISH COLUMBIA.[233]\r\n\r\n   5.  kedjin (from djin = hand).\r\n  10.  djinkat = both hands?\r\n\r\nThus far the quinary formation is simple and regular; and in view of the\r\nevidence with which these and similar illustrations furnish us, it is most\r\nsurprising to find an eminent authority making the unequivocal statement\r\nthat the number 10 is nowhere expressed by 2 fives[234]--that all tribes\r\nwhich begin their count on a quinary base express 10 by a simple word. It\r\nis a fact, as will be fully illustrated in the following pages, that\r\nquinary number systems, when extended, usually merge into either the\r\ndecimal or the vigesimal. The result is, of course, a compound of two, and\r\nsometimes of three, systems in one scale. A pure quinary or vigesimal\r\nnumber system is exceedingly rare; but quinary scales certainly do exist in\r\nwhich, as far as we possess the numerals, no trace of any other influence\r\nappears. It is also to be noticed that some tribes, like the Eskimos of\r\nPoint Barrow, though their systems may properly be classed as mixed\r\nsystems, exhibit a decided preference for 5 as a base, and in counting\r\nobjects, divided into groups of 5, obtaining the sum in this way.[235]\r\n\r\nBut the savage, after counting up to 10, often finds himself unconsciously\r\nimpelled to depart from his strict reckoning by fives, and to assume a new\r\nbasis of reference. Take, for example, the Zuñi system, in which the first\r\n2 fives are:\r\n\r\n   5.  öpte = the notched off.\r\n  10.  astem'thla = all the fingers.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the Zuñi does not say \"two hands,\" or \"the fingers\r\nof both hands,\" but simply \"all the fingers.\" The 5 is no longer prominent,\r\nbut instead the mere notion of one entire count of the fingers has taken\r\nits place. The division of the fingers into two sets of five each is still\r\nin his mind, but it is no longer the leading idea. As the count proceeds\r\nfurther, the quinary base may be retained, or it may be supplanted by a\r\ndecimal or a vigesimal base. How readily the one or the other may\r\npredominate is seen by a glance at the following numerals:\r\n\r\n\r\n  GALIBI.[236]\r\n\r\n   5.  atoneigne oietonaï = 1 hand.\r\n  10.  oia batoue = the other hand.\r\n  20.  poupoupatoret oupoume = feet and hands.\r\n  40.  opoupoume = twice the feet and hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GUARANI.[237]\r\n\r\n   5.  ace popetei    = 1 hand.\r\n  10.  ace pomocoi    = 2 hands.\r\n  20.  acepo acepiabe = hands and feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FATE.[238]\r\n\r\n   5.  lima       = hand.\r\n  10.  relima     = 2 hands.\r\n  20.  relima rua = (2 × 5) × 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  KIRIRI\r\n\r\n   5.  mibika misa      = 1 hand.\r\n  10.  mikriba misa sai = both hands.\r\n  20.  mikriba nusa ideko ibi sai = both hands together with the feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ZAMUCO\r\n\r\n   5.  tsuena yimana-ite = ended 1 hand.\r\n  10.  tsuena yimana-die = ended both hands.\r\n  20.  tsuena yiri-die   = ended both feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PIKUMBUL\r\n\r\n   5.  mulanbu.\r\n  10.  bularin murra = belonging to the two hands.\r\n  15.  mulanba dinna = 5 toes added on (to the 10 fingers).\r\n  20.  bularin dinna = belonging to the 2 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  YARUROS.[239]\r\n\r\n   5.  kani-iktsi-mo = 1 hand alone.\r\n  10.  yowa-iktsi-bo = all the hands.\r\n  15.  kani-tao-mo   = 1 foot alone.\r\n  20.  kani-pume     = 1 man.\r\n\r\nBy the time 20 is reached the savage has probably allowed his conception of\r\nany aggregate to be so far modified that this number does not present\r\nitself to his mind as 4 fives. It may find expression in some phraseology\r\nsuch as the Kiriris employ--\"both hands together with the feet\"--or in the\r\nshorter \"ended both feet\" of the Zamucos, in which case we may presume that\r\nhe is conscious that his count has been completed by means of the four sets\r\nof fives which are furnished by his hands and feet. But it is at least\r\nequally probable that he instinctively divides his total into 2 tens, and\r\nthus passes unconsciously from the quinary into the decimal scale. Again,\r\nthe summing up of the 10 fingers and 10 toes often results in the concept\r\nof a single whole, a lump sum, so to speak, and the savage then says \"one\r\nman,\" or something that gives utterance to this thought of a new unit. This\r\nleads the quinary into the vigesimal scale, and produces the combination so\r\noften found in certain parts of the world. Thus the inevitable tendency of\r\nany number system of quinary origin is toward the establishment of another\r\nand larger base, and the formation of a number system in which both are\r\nused. Wherever this is done, the greater of the two bases is always to be\r\nregarded as the principal number base of the language, and the 5 as\r\nentirely subordinate to it. It is hardly correct to say that, as a number\r\nsystem is extended, the quinary element disappears and gives place to the\r\ndecimal or vigesimal, but rather that it becomes a factor of quite\r\nsecondary importance in the development of the scale. If, for example, 8 is\r\nexpressed by 5-3 in a quinary decimal system, 98 will be 9 × 10 + 5-3. The\r\nquinary element does not disappear, but merely sinks into a relatively\r\nunimportant position.\r\n\r\nOne of the purest examples of quinary numeration is that furnished by the\r\nBetoya scale, already given in full in Chapter III., and briefly mentioned\r\nat the beginning of this chapter. In the simplicity and regularity of its\r\nconstruction it is so noteworthy that it is worth repeating, as the first\r\nof the long list of quinary systems given in the following pages. No\r\nfurther comment is needed on it than that already made in connection with\r\nits digital significance. As far as given by Dr. Brinton the scale is:\r\n\r\n   1.  tey.\r\n   2.  cayapa.\r\n   3.  toazumba.\r\n   4.  cajezea     = 2 with plural termination.\r\n   5.  teente      = hand.\r\n   6.  teyente tey = hand 1.\r\n   7.  teyente cayapa    = hand 2.\r\n   8.  teyente toazumba  = hand 3.\r\n   9.  teyente caesea    = hand 4.\r\n  10.  caya ente, or caya huena = 2 hands.\r\n  11.  caya ente-tey     = 2 hands 1.\r\n  15.  toazumba-ente     = 3 hands.\r\n  16.  toazumba-ente-tey = 3 hands 1.\r\n  20.  caesea ente       = 4 hands.\r\n\r\nA far more common method of progression is furnished by languages which\r\ninterrupt the quinary formation at 10, and express that number by a single\r\nword. Any scale in which this takes place can, from this point onward, be\r\nquinary only in the subordinate sense to which allusion has just been made.\r\nExamples of this are furnished in a more or less perfect manner by nearly\r\nall so-called quinary-vigesimal and quinary-decimal scales. As fairly\r\nrepresenting this phase of number-system structure, I have selected the\r\nfirst 20 numerals from the following languages:\r\n\r\n\r\n  WELSH.[240]\r\n\r\n   1.  un.\r\n   2.  dau.\r\n   3.  tri.\r\n   4.  pedwar.\r\n   5.  pump.\r\n   6.  chwech.\r\n   7.  saith.\r\n   8.  wyth.\r\n   9.  naw.\r\n  10.  deg.\r\n  11.  un ar ddeg     = 1 + 10.\r\n  12.  deuddeg        = 2 + 10.\r\n  13.  tri ar ddeg    = 3 + 10.\r\n  14.  pedwar ar ddeg = 4 + 10.\r\n  15.  pymtheg        = 5 + 10.\r\n  16.  un ar bymtheg  = 1 + 5 + 10.\r\n  17.  dau ar bymtheg = 2 + 5 + 10.\r\n  18.  tri ar bymtheg = 3 + 5 + 10.\r\n  19.  pedwar ar bymtheg = 4 + 5 + 10.\r\n  20.  ugain.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NAHUATL.[241]\r\n\r\n   1.  ce.\r\n   2.  ome.\r\n   3.  yei.\r\n   4.  naui.\r\n   5.  macuilli.\r\n   6.  chiquacen = [5] + 1.\r\n   7.  chicome   = [5] + 2.\r\n   8.  chicuey   = [5] + 3.\r\n   9.  chiucnaui = [5] + 4.\r\n  10.  matlactli.\r\n  11.  matlactli oce    = 10 + 1.\r\n  12.  matlactli omome  = 10 + 2.\r\n  13.  matlactli omey   = 10 + 3.\r\n  14.  matlactli onnaui = 10 + 4.\r\n  15.  caxtolli.\r\n  16.  caxtolli oce    = 15 + 1.\r\n  17.  caxtolli omome  = 15 + 2.\r\n  18.  caxtolli omey   = 15 + 3.\r\n  19.  caxtolli onnaui = 15 + 4.\r\n  20.  cempualli = 1 account.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CANAQUE[242] NEW CALEDONIA.\r\n\r\n   1.  chaguin.\r\n   2.  carou.\r\n   3.  careri.\r\n   4.  caboue\r\n   5.  cani.\r\n   6.  cani-mon-chaguin = 5 + 1.\r\n   7.  cani-mon-carou   = 5 + 2.\r\n   8.  cani-mon-careri  = 5 + 3.\r\n   9.  cani-mon-caboue  = 5 + 4.\r\n  10.  panrere.\r\n  11.  panrere-mon-chaguin = 10 + 1.\r\n  12.  panrere-mon-carou   = 10 + 2.\r\n  13.  panrere-mon-careri  = 10 + 3.\r\n  14.  panrere-mon-caboue  = 10 + 4.\r\n  15.  panrere-mon-cani    = 10 + 5.\r\n  16.  panrere-mon-cani-mon-chaguin = 10 + 5 + 1.\r\n  17.  panrere-mon-cani-mon-carou   = 10 + 5 + 2.\r\n  18.  panrere-mon-cani-mon-careri  = 10 + 5 + 3.\r\n  19.  panrere-mon-cani-mon-caboue  = 10 + 5 + 4.\r\n  20.  jaquemo = 1 person.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GUATO.[243]\r\n\r\n   1.  cenai.\r\n   2.  dououni.\r\n   3.  coum.\r\n   4.  dekai.\r\n   5.  quinoui.\r\n   6.  cenai-caicaira   = 1 on the other?\r\n   7.  dououni-caicaira = 2 on the other?\r\n   8.  coum-caicaira    = 3 on the other?\r\n   9.  dekai-caicaira   = 4 on the other?\r\n  10.  quinoi-da        = 5 × 2.\r\n  11.  cenai-ai-caibo   = 1 + (the) hands.\r\n  12.  dououni-ai-caibo = 2 + 10.\r\n  13.  coum-ai-caibo    = 3 + 10.\r\n  14.  dekai-ai-caibo   = 4 + 10.\r\n  15.  quin-oibo        = 5 × 3.\r\n  16.  cenai-ai-quacoibo = 1 + 15.\r\n  17.  dououni-ai-quacoibo = 2 + 15.\r\n  18.  coum-ai-quacoibo = 3 + 15.\r\n  19.  dekai-ai-quacoibo = 4 + 15.\r\n  20.  quinoui-ai-quacoibo = 5 + 15.\r\n\r\nThe meanings assigned to the numerals 6 to 9 are entirely conjectural.

The Nahuatl, on the other hand, counts from 5 to 10 by the ordinary\r\nquinary method, and then appears to pass into the decimal form. But when 16\r\nis reached, we find the quinary influence still persistent; and from this\r\npoint to 20, the numeral words in both scales are such as to show that the\r\nnotion of counting by fives is quite as prominent as the notion of\r\nreferring to 10 as a base. Above 20 the systems become vigesimal, with a\r\nquinary or decimal structure appearing in all numerals except multiples of\r\n20. Thus, in Welsh, 36 is _unarbymtheg ar ugain_, 1 + 5  + 10 + 20; and in\r\nNahuatl the same number is _cempualli caxtolli oce_, 20 + 15 + 1. Hence\r\nthese and similar number systems, though commonly alluded to as vigesimal,\r\nare really mixed scales, with 20 as their primary base. The Canaque scale\r\ndiffers from the Nahuatl only in forming a compound word for 15, instead of\r\nintroducing a new and simple term.\r\n\r\nIn the examples which follow, it is not thought best to extend the lists of\r\nnumerals beyond 10, except in special instances where the illustration of\r\nsome particular point may demand it. The usual quinary scale will be found,\r\nwith a few exceptions like those just instanced, to have the following\r\nstructure or one similar to it in all essential details: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\r\n5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4, 10, 10-1, 10-2, 10-3, 10-4, 10-5, 10-5-1, 10-5-2,\r\n10-5-3, 10-5-4, 20. From these forms the entire system can readily be\r\nconstructed as soon as it is known whether its principal base is to be 10\r\nor 20.\r\n\r\nTurning first to the native African languages, I have selected the\r\nfollowing quinary scales from the abundant material that has been collected\r\nby the various explorers of the \"Dark Continent.\" In some cases the\r\nnumerals of certain tribes, as given by one writer, are found to differ\r\nwidely from the same numerals as reported by another.

Like\r\nthose of which mention was made at the beginning of this chapter, it\r\npersists in progressing by fives until it reaches 20, when it announces a\r\nnew base, which shows that the system will from now on be vigesimal. This\r\nscale is one of the most interesting of which we have any record, and will\r\nbe noticed again in the next chapter. In many respects it is like the scale\r\nof the Point Barrow Eskimo, which was given early in Chapter III. The\r\nEskimo languages are characteristically quinary-vigesimal in their number\r\nsystems, but few of them present such perfect examples of that method of\r\ncounting as do the two just mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHIPPEWAY.[298]\r\n\r\n   1.  bejig.\r\n   2.  nij.\r\n   3.  nisswi.\r\n   4.  niwin.\r\n   5.  nanun.\r\n   6.  ningotwasswi = 1 again?\r\n   7.  nijwasswi    = 2 again?\r\n   8.  nishwasswi   = 3 again?\r\n   9.  jangasswi    = 4 again?\r\n  10.  midasswi     = 5 again.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MASSACHUSETTS.[299]\r\n\r\n   1.  nequt.\r\n   2.  neese.\r\n   3.  nish.\r\n   4.  yaw.\r\n   5.  napanna     = on one side, _i.e._ 1 hand.\r\n   6.  nequttatash = 1 added.\r\n   7.  nesausuk    = 2 again?\r\n   8.  shawosuk    = 3 again?\r\n   9.  pashoogun   = it comes near, _i.e._ to 10.\r\n  10.  puik.\r\n\r\n\r\n  OJIBWA OF CHEGOIMEGON.[300]\r\n\r\n   1.  bashik.\r\n   2.  neensh.\r\n   3.  niswe.\r\n   4.  newin.\r\n   5.  nanun.\r\n   6.  ningodwaswe = 1 again?\r\n   7.  nishwaswe   = 2 again?\r\n   8.  shouswe     = 3 again?\r\n   9.  shangaswe   = 4 again?\r\n  10.  medaswe     = 5 again?\r\n\r\n\r\n  OTTAWA.\r\n\r\n   1.  ningotchau.\r\n   2.  ninjwa.\r\n   3.  niswa.\r\n   4.  niwin.\r\n   5.  nanau.\r\n   6.  ningotwaswi = 1 again?\r\n   7.  ninjwaswi   = 2 again?\r\n   8.  nichwaswi   = 3 again?\r\n   9.  shang.\r\n  10.  kwetch.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DELAWARE.\r\n\r\n   1.  n'gutti.\r\n   2.  niskha.\r\n   3.  nakha.\r\n   4.  newa.\r\n   5.  nalan [akin to palenach, hand].\r\n   6.  guttash  = 1 on the other side.\r\n   7.  nishash  = 2 on the other side.\r\n   8.  khaash   = 3 on the other side.\r\n   9.  peshgonk = coming near.\r\n  10.  tellen   = no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SHAWNOE.\r\n\r\n   1.  negote.\r\n   2.  neshwa.\r\n   3.  nithuie.\r\n   4.  newe.\r\n   5.  nialinwe     = gone.\r\n   6.  negotewathwe = 1 further.\r\n   7.  neshwathwe   = 2 further.\r\n   8.  sashekswa    = 3 further?\r\n   9.  chakatswe [akin to chagisse, \"used up\"].\r\n  10.  metathwe     = no further.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MICMAC.[301]\r\n\r\n   1.  naiookt.\r\n   2.  tahboo.\r\n   3.  seest.\r\n   4.  naioo.\r\n   5.  nahn.\r\n   6.  usoo-cum.\r\n   7.  eloo-igunuk.\r\n   8.  oo-gumoolchin.\r\n   9.  pescoonaduk.\r\n  10.  mtlin.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of the Micmac numerals is most noteworthy. The numerals are\r\nreal verbs, instead of adjectives, or, as is sometimes the case, nouns.\r\nThey are conjugated through all the variations of mood, tense, person, and\r\nnumber. The forms given above are not those that would be used in counting,\r\nbut are for specific use, being varied according to the thought it was\r\nintended to express.

Every part of the world contributes its\r\nshare except Europe, where the only exceptions to the universal use of the\r\ndecimal system are the half-dozen languages, which still linger on its\r\nconfines, whose number base is the vigesimal. Not only is there no living\r\nEuropean tongue possessing a quinary number system, but no trace of this\r\nmethod of counting is found in any of the numerals of the earlier forms of\r\nspeech, which have now become obsolete. The only possible exceptions of\r\nwhich I can think are the Greek [Greek: pempazein], to count by fives, and\r\na few kindred words which certainly do hint at a remote antiquity in which\r\nthe ancestors of the Greeks counted on their fingers, and so grouped their\r\nunits into fives. The Roman notation, the familiar I., II., III., IV.\r\n(originally IIII.), V., VI., etc., with equal certainty suggests quinary\r\ncounting, but the Latin language contains no vestige of anything of the\r\nkind, and the whole range of Latin literature is silent on this point,\r\nthough it contains numerous references to finger counting. It is quite\r\nwithin the bounds of possibility that the prehistoric nations of Europe\r\npossessed and used a quinary numeration. But of these races the modern\r\nworld knows nothing save the few scanty facts that can be gathered from the\r\nstone implements which have now and then been brought to light. Their\r\nlanguages have perished as utterly as have the races themselves, and\r\nspeculation concerning them is useless. Whatever their form of numeration\r\nmay have been, it has left no perceptible trace on the languages by which\r\nthey were succeeded. Even the languages of northern and central Europe\r\nwhich were contemporary with the Greek and Latin of classical times have,\r\nwith the exception of the Celtic tongues of the extreme North-west, left\r\nbehind them but meagre traces for the modern student to work on. We presume\r\nthat the ancient Gauls and Goths, Huns and Scythians, and other barbarian\r\ntribes had the same method of numeration that their descendants now have;\r\nand it is a matter of certainty that the decimal scale was, at that time,\r\nnot used with the universality which now obtains; but wherever the decimal\r\nwas not used, the universal method was vigesimal; and that the quinary ever\r\nhad anything of a foothold in Europe is only to be guessed from its\r\npresence to-day in almost all of the other corners of the world.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that the quinary is that one of the three natural scales with\r\nthe smallest base, it has been conjectured that all tribes possess, at some\r\ntime in their history, a quinary numeration, which at a later period merges\r\ninto either the decimal or the vigesimal, and thus disappears or forms with\r\none of the latter a mixed system.[323] In support of this theory it is\r\nurged that extensive regions which now show nothing but decimal counting\r\nwere, beyond all reasonable doubt, quinary. It is well known, for example,\r\nthat the decimal system of the Malays has spread over almost the entire\r\nPolynesian region, displacing whatever native scales it encountered. The\r\nsame phenomenon has been observed in Africa, where the Arab traders have\r\ndisseminated their own numeral system very widely, the native tribes\r\nadopting it or modifying their own scales in such a manner that the Arab\r\ninfluence is detected without difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts, and of the extreme readiness with which a tribe\r\nwould through its finger counting fall into the use of the quinary method,\r\nit does not at first seem improbable that the quinary was _the_ original\r\nsystem. But an extended study of the methods of counting in vogue among the\r\nuncivilized races of all parts of the world has shown that this theory is\r\nentirely untenable. The decimal scale is no less simple in its structure\r\nthan the quinary; and the savage, as he extends the limit of his scale from\r\n5 to 6, may call his new number 5-1, or, with equal probability, give it an\r\nentirely new name, independent in all respects of any that have preceded\r\nit. With the use of this new name there may be associated the conception of\r\n\"5 and 1 more\"; but in such multitudes of instances the words employed show\r\nno trace of any such meaning, that it is impossible for any one to draw,\r\nwith any degree of safety, the inference that the signification was\r\noriginally there, but that the changes of time had wrought changes in\r\nverbal form so great as to bury it past the power of recovery. A full\r\ndiscussion of this question need not be entered upon here. But it will be\r\nof interest to notice two or three numeral scales in which the quinary\r\ninfluence is so faint as to be hardly discernible. They are found in\r\nconsiderable numbers among the North American Indian languages, as may be\r\nseen by consulting the vocabularies that have been prepared and published\r\nduring the last half century.[324] From these I have selected the\r\nfollowing, which are sufficient to illustrate the point in question:\r\n\r\n\r\n  QUAPPA.\r\n\r\n   1.  milchtih.\r\n   2.  nonnepah.\r\n   3.  dahghenih.\r\n   4.  tuah.\r\n   5.  sattou.\r\n   6.  schappeh.\r\n   7.  pennapah.\r\n   8.  pehdaghenih.\r\n   9.  schunkkah.\r\n  10.  gedeh bonah.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TERRABA.[325]\r\n\r\n   1.  krara.\r\n   2.  krowü.\r\n   3.  krom miah.\r\n   4.  krob king.\r\n   5.  krasch kingde.\r\n   6.  terdeh.\r\n   7.  kogodeh.\r\n   8.  kwongdeh.\r\n   9.  schkawdeh.\r\n  10.  dwowdeh.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MOHICAN\r\n\r\n   1.  ngwitloh.\r\n   2.  neesoh.\r\n   3.  noghhoh.\r\n   4.  nauwoh.\r\n   5.  nunon.\r\n   6.  ngwittus.\r\n   7.  tupouwus.\r\n   8.  ghusooh.\r\n   9.  nauneeweh.\r\n  10.  mtannit.\r\n\r\nIn the Quappa scale 7 and 8 appear to be derived from 2 and 3, while 6 and\r\n9 show no visible trace of kinship with 1 and 4. In Mohican, on the other\r\nhand, 6 and 9 seem to be derived from 1 and 4, while 7 and 8 have little or\r\nno claim to relationship with 2 and 3. In some scales a single word only is\r\nfound in the second quinate to indicate that 5 was originally the base on\r\nwhich the system rested. It is hardly to be doubted, even, that change\r\nmight affect each and every one of the numerals from 5 to 10 or 6 to 9, so\r\nthat a dependence which might once have been easily detected is now\r\nunrecognizable.\r\n\r\nBut if this is so, the natural and inevitable question follows--might not\r\nthis have been the history of all numeral scales now purely decimal? May\r\nnot the changes of time have altered the compounds which were once a clear\r\nindication of quinary counting, until no trace remains by which they can be\r\nfollowed back to their true origin? Perhaps so. It is not in the least\r\ndegree probable, but its possibility may, of course, be admitted. But even\r\nthen the universality of quinary counting for primitive peoples is by no\r\nmeans established. In Chapter II, examples were given of races which had no\r\nnumber base. Later on it was observed that in Australia and South America\r\nmany tribes used 2 as their number base; in some cases counting on past 5\r\nwithout showing any tendency to use that as a new unit. Again, through the\r\nhabit of counting upon the finger joints, instead of the fingers\r\nthemselves, the use of 3 as a base is brought into prominence, and 6 and 9\r\nbecome 2 threes and 3 threes, respectively, instead of 5 + 1 and 5 + 4. The\r\nsame may be noticed of 4. Counting by means of his fingers, without\r\nincluding the thumbs, the savage begins by dividing into fours instead of\r\nfives. Traces of this form of counting are somewhat numerous, especially\r\namong the North American aboriginal tribes. Hence the quinary form of\r\ncounting, however widespread its use may be shown to be, can in no way be\r\nclaimed as the universal method of any stage of development in the history\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, the passage from the base to the next\r\nsucceeding number in any scale, is clearly defined. But among races whose\r\nintelligence is of a low order, or--if it be permissible to express it in\r\nthis way--among races whose number sense is feeble, progression from one\r\nnumber to the next is not always in accordance with any well-defined law.\r\nAfter one or two distinct numerals the count may, as in the case of the\r\nVeddas and the Andamans, proceed by finger pantomime and by the repetition\r\nof the same word. Occasionally the same word is used for two successive\r\nnumbers, some gesture undoubtedly serving to distinguish the one from the\r\nother in the savage's mind. Examples of this are not infrequent among the\r\nforest tribes of South America. In the Tariana dialect 9 and 10 are\r\nexpressed by the same word, _paihipawalianuda;_ in Cobeu, 8 and 9 by\r\n_pepelicoloblicouilini;_ in Barre, 4, 5, and 9 by _ualibucubi._[326] In\r\nother languages the change from one numeral to the next is so slight that\r\none instinctively concludes that the savage is forming in his own mind\r\nanother, to him new, numeral immediately from the last. In such cases the\r\nentire number system is scanty, and the creeping hesitancy with which\r\nprogress is made is visible in the forms which the numerals are made to\r\ntake. A single illustration or two of this must suffice; but the ones\r\nchosen are not isolated cases. The scale of the Macunis,[327] one of the\r\nnumerous tribes of Brazil, is\r\n\r\n   1.  pocchaenang.\r\n   2.  haihg.\r\n   3.  haigunhgnill.\r\n   4.  haihgtschating.\r\n   5.  haihgtschihating     = another 4?\r\n   6.  hathig-stchihathing  = 2-4?\r\n   7.  hathink-tschihathing = 2-5?\r\n   8.  hathink-tschihating  = 2 × 4?\r\n\r\nThe complete absence of--one is tempted to say--any rhyme or reason from\r\nthis scale is more than enough to refute any argument which might tend to\r\nshow that the quinary, or any other scale, was ever the sole number scale\r\nof primitive man. Irregular as this is, the system of the Montagnais fully\r\nmatches it, as the subjoined numerals show:[328]\r\n\r\n   1.  inl'are.\r\n   2.  nak'e.\r\n   3.  t'are.\r\n   4.  dinri.\r\n   5.  se-sunlare.\r\n   6.  elkke-t'are      = 2 × 3.\r\n   7.  t'a-ye-oyertan   = 10 - 3,\r\n        or inl'as dinri = 4 + 3?\r\n   8.  elkke-dinri      = 2 × 4.\r\n   9.  inl'a-ye-oyertan = 10 - 1.\r\n  10.  onernan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE VIGESIMAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its ordinary development the quinary system is almost sure to merge into\r\neither the decimal or the vigesimal system, and to form, with one or the\r\nother or both of these, a mixed system of counting. In Africa, Oceanica,\r\nand parts of North America, the union is almost always with the decimal\r\nscale; while in other parts of the world the quinary and the vigesimal\r\nsystems have shown a decided affinity for each other. It is not to be\r\nunderstood that any geographical law of distribution has ever been observed\r\nwhich governs this, but merely that certain families of races have shown a\r\npreference for the one or the other method of counting. These families,\r\ndisseminating their characteristics through their various branches, have\r\nproduced certain groups of races which exhibit a well-marked tendency, here\r\ntoward the decimal, and there toward the vigesimal form of numeration. As\r\nfar as can be ascertained, the choice of the one or the other scale is\r\ndetermined by no external circumstances, but depends solely on the mental\r\ncharacteristics of the tribes themselves. Environment does not exert any\r\nappreciable influence either. Both decimal and vigesimal numeration are\r\nfound indifferently in warm and in cold countries; in fruitful and in\r\nbarren lands; in maritime and in inland regions; and among highly civilized\r\nor deeply degraded peoples.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the principal number base of any tribe is to be 20 seems to\r\ndepend entirely upon a single consideration; are the fingers alone used as\r\nan aid to counting, or are both fingers and toes used? If only the fingers\r\nare employed, the resulting scale must become decimal if sufficiently\r\nextended. If use is made of the toes in addition to the fingers, the\r\noutcome must inevitably be a vigesimal system. Subordinate to either one of\r\nthese the quinary may and often does appear. It is never the principal base\r\nin any extended system.\r\n\r\nTo the statement just made respecting the origin of vigesimal counting,\r\nexception may, of course, be taken. In the case of numeral scales like the\r\nWelsh, the Nahuatl, and many others where the exact meanings of the\r\nnumerals cannot be ascertained, no proof exists that the ancestors of these\r\npeoples ever used either finger or toe counting; and the sweeping statement\r\nthat any vigesimal scale is the outgrowth of the use of these natural\r\ncounters is not susceptible of proof. But so many examples are met with in\r\nwhich the origin is clearly of this nature, that no hesitation is felt in\r\nputting the above forward as a general explanation for the existence of\r\nthis kind of counting. Any other origin is difficult to reconcile with\r\nobserved facts, and still more difficult to reconcile with any rational\r\ntheory of number system development. Dismissing from consideration the\r\nquinary scale, let us briefly examine once more the natural process of\r\nevolution through which the decimal and the vigesimal scales come into\r\nbeing. After the completion of one count of the fingers the savage\r\nannounces his result in some form which definitely states to his mind the\r\nfact that the end of a well-marked series has been reached. Beginning\r\nagain, he now repeats his count of 10, either on his own fingers or on the\r\nfingers of another. With the completion of the second 10 the result is\r\nannounced, not in a new unit, but by means of a duplication of the term\r\nalready used. It is scarcely credible that the unit unconsciously adopted\r\nat the termination of the first count should now be dropped, and a new one\r\nsubstituted in its place. When the method here described is employed, 20 is\r\nnot a natural unit to which higher numbers may be referred. It is wholly\r\nartificial; and it would be most surprising if it were adopted. But if the\r\ncount of the second 10 is made on the toes in place of the fingers, the\r\nelement of repetition which entered into the previous method is now\r\nwanting. Instead of referring each new number to the 10 already completed,\r\nthe savage is still feeling his way along, designating his new terms by\r\nsuch phrases as \"1 on the foot,\" \"2 on the other foot,\" etc. And now, when\r\n20 is reached, a single series is finished instead of a double series as\r\nbefore; and the result is expressed in one of the many methods already\r\nnoticed--\"one man,\" \"hands and feet,\" \"the feet finished,\" \"all the fingers\r\nof hands and feet,\" or some equivalent formula. Ten is no longer the\r\nnatural base. The number from which the new start is made is 20, and the\r\nresulting scale is inevitably vigesimal. If pebbles or sticks are used\r\ninstead of fingers, the system will probably be decimal. But back of the\r\nstick and pebble counting the 10 natural counters always exist, and to them\r\nwe must always look for the origin of this scale.\r\n\r\nIn any collection of the principal vigesimal number systems of the world,\r\none would naturally begin with those possessed by the Celtic races of\r\nEurope. These races, the earliest European peoples of whom we have any\r\nexact knowledge, show a preference for counting by twenties, which is\r\nalmost as decided as that manifested by Teutonic races for counting by\r\ntens. It has been conjectured by some writers that the explanation for this\r\nwas to be found in the ancient commercial intercourse which existed between\r\nthe Britons and the Carthaginians and Phoenicians, whose number systems\r\nshowed traces of a vigesimal tendency. Considering the fact that the use of\r\nvigesimal counting was universal among Celtic races, this explanation is\r\nquite gratuitous. The reason why the Celts used this method is entirely\r\nunknown, and need not concern investigators in the least. But the fact that\r\nthey did use it is important, and commands attention. The five Celtic\r\nlanguages, Breton, Irish, Welsh, Manx, and Gaelic, contain the following\r\nwell-defined vigesimal scales. Only the principal or characteristic\r\nnumerals are given, those being sufficient to enable the reader to follow\r\nintelligently the growth of the systems. Each contains the decimal element\r\nalso, and is, therefore, to be regarded as a mixed decimal-vigesimal\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n  IRISH.[329]\r\n\r\n    10.  deic.\r\n    20.  fice.\r\n    30.  triocad      = 3-10\r\n    40.  da ficid     = 2-20.\r\n    50.  caogad       = 5-10.\r\n    60.  tri ficid    = 3-20.\r\n    70.  reactmoga    = 7-10.\r\n    80.  ceitqe ficid = 4-20.\r\n    90.  nocad        = 9-10.\r\n   100.  cead.\r\n  1000.  mile.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GAELIC.[330]\r\n\r\n    10.  deich.\r\n    20.  fichead.\r\n    30.  deich ar fichead         = 10 + 20.\r\n    40.  da fhichead              = 2-20.\r\n    50.  da fhichead is deich     = 40 + 10.\r\n    60.  tri fichead              = 3-20.\r\n    70.  tri fichead is deich     = 60 + 10.\r\n    80.  ceithir fichead          = 4-20.\r\n    90.  ceithir fichead is deich = 80 + 10.\r\n   100.  ceud.\r\n  1000.  mile.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WELSH.[331]\r\n\r\n    10.  deg.\r\n    20.  ugain.\r\n    30.  deg ar hugain      = 10 + 20.\r\n    40.  deugain            = 2-20.\r\n    50.  deg a deugain      = 10 + 40.\r\n    60.  trigain            = 3-20.\r\n    70.  deg a thrigain     = 10 + 60.\r\n    80.  pedwar ugain       = 4-20.\r\n    90.  deg a pedwar ugain = 80 + 10.\r\n   100.  cant.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MANX.[332]\r\n\r\n    10.  jeih.\r\n    20.  feed.\r\n    30.  yn jeih as feed    = 10 + 20.\r\n    40.  daeed              = 2-20.\r\n    50.  jeih as daeed      = 10 + 40.\r\n    60.  three-feed         = 3-20.\r\n    70.  three-feed as jeih = 60 + 10.\r\n    80.  kiare-feed         = 4-20.\r\n   100.  keead.\r\n  1000.  thousane, or jeih cheead.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BRETON.[333]\r\n\r\n    10.  dec.\r\n    20.  ueguend.\r\n    30.  tregond             = 3-10.\r\n    40.  deu ueguend         = 2-20.\r\n    50.  hanter hand         = half hundred.\r\n    60.  tri ueguend         = 3-20.\r\n    70.  dec ha tri ueguend  = 10 + 60.\r\n    80.  piar ueguend        = 4-20.\r\n    90.  dec ha piar ueguend = 10 + 80.\r\n   100.  cand.\r\n   120.  hueh ueguend    = 6-20.\r\n   140.  seih ueguend    = 7-20.\r\n   160.  eih ueguend     = 8-20.\r\n   180.  nau ueguend     = 9-20.\r\n   200.  deu gand        = 2-100.\r\n   240.  deuzec ueguend  = 12-20.\r\n   280.  piarzec ueguend = 14-20.\r\n   300.  tri hand, or pembzec ueguend.\r\n   400.  piar hand       = 4-100.\r\n  1000.  mil.\r\n\r\nThese lists show that the native development of the Celtic number systems,\r\noriginally showing a strong preference for the vigesimal method of\r\nprogression, has been greatly modified by intercourse with Teutonic and\r\nLatin races. The higher numerals in all these languages, and in Irish many\r\nof the lower also, are seen at a glance to be decimal. Among the scales\r\nhere given the Breton, the legitimate descendant of the ancient Gallic, is\r\nespecially interesting; but here, just as in the other Celtic tongues, when\r\nwe reach 1000, the familiar Latin term for that number appears in the\r\nvarious corruptions of _mille_, 1000, which was carried into the Celtic\r\ncountries by missionary and military influences.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Celtic language, mention must be made of the\r\npersistent vigesimal element which has held its place in French. The\r\nancient Gauls, while adopting the language of their conquerors, so far\r\nmodified the decimal system of Latin as to replace the natural _septante_,\r\n70, _octante_, 80, _nonante_, 90, by _soixante-dix_, 60-10, _quatre-vingt_,\r\n4-20, and _quatrevingt-dix_, 4-20-10. From 61 to 99 the French method of\r\ncounting is wholly vigesimal, except for the presence of the one word\r\n_soixante_. In old French this element was still more pronounced.\r\n_Soixante_ had not yet appeared; and 60 and 70 were _treis vinz_, 3-20, and\r\n_treis vinz et dis_, 3-20 and 10 respectively. Also, 120 was _six vinz_,\r\n6-20, 140 was _sept-vinz_, etc.[334] How far this method ever extended in\r\nthe French language proper, it is, perhaps, impossible to say; but from the\r\nname of an almshouse, _les quinze-vingts_,[335] which formerly existed in\r\nParis, and was designed as a home for 300 blind persons, and from the\r\n_pembzek-ueguent_, 15-20, of the Breton, which still survives, we may infer\r\nthat it was far enough to make it the current system of common life.\r\n\r\nEurope yields one other example of vigesimal counting, in the number system\r\nof the Basques. Like most of the Celtic scales, the Basque seems to become\r\ndecimal above 100. It does not appear to be related to any other European\r\nsystem, but to be quite isolated philologically. The higher units, as\r\n_mila_, 1000, are probably borrowed, and not native. The tens in the Basque\r\nscale are:[336]\r\n\r\n    10.  hamar.\r\n    20.  hogei.\r\n    30.  hogei eta hamar     = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  berrogei            = 2-20.\r\n    50.  berrogei eta hamar  = 2-20 + 10.\r\n    60.  hirurogei           = 3-20.\r\n    70.  hirurogei eta hamar = 3-20 + 10.\r\n    80.  laurogei            = 4-20.\r\n    90.  laurogei eta hamar  = 4-20 + 10.\r\n   100.  ehun.\r\n  1000.  _milla_.\r\n\r\nBesides these we find two or three numeral scales in Europe which contain\r\ndistinct traces of vigesimal counting, though the scales are, as a whole,\r\ndecidedly decimal. The Danish, one of the essentially Germanic languages,\r\ncontains the following numerals:\r\n\r\n    30.  tredive            = 3-10.\r\n    40.  fyrretyve          = 4-10.\r\n    50.  halvtredsindstyve  = half (of 20) from 3-20.\r\n    60.  tresindstyve       = 3-20.\r\n    70.  halvfierdsindstyve = half from 4-20.\r\n    80.  fiirsindstyve      = 4-20.\r\n    90.  halvfemsindstyve   = half from 5-20.\r\n   100.  hundrede.\r\n\r\nGermanic number systems are, as a rule, pure decimal systems; and the\r\nDanish exception is quite remarkable. We have, to be sure, such expressions\r\nin English as _three score_, _four score_, etc., and the Swedish,\r\nIcelandic, and other languages of this group have similar terms. Still,\r\nthese are not pure numerals, but auxiliary words rather, which belong to\r\nthe same category as _pair_, _dozen_, _dizaine_, etc., while the Danish\r\nwords just given are the ordinary numerals which form a part of the\r\nevery-day vocabulary of that language. The method by which this scale\r\nexpresses 50, 70, and 90 is especially noticeable. It will be met with\r\nagain, and further examples of its occurrence given.\r\n\r\nIn Albania there exists one single fragment of vigesimal numeration, which\r\nis probably an accidental compound rather than the remnant of a former\r\nvigesimal number system. With this single exception the Albanian scale is\r\nof regular decimal formation. A few of the numerals are given for the sake\r\nof comparison:[337]\r\n\r\n    30.  tridgiete    = 3-10.\r\n    40.  dizet        = 2-20.\r\n    50.  pesedgiete   = 5-10.\r\n    60.  giastedgiete = 6-10, etc.\r\n\r\nAmong the almost countless dialects of Africa we find a comparatively small\r\nnumber of vigesimal number systems. The powers of the negro tribes are not\r\nstrongly developed in counting, and wherever their numeral scales have been\r\ntaken down by explorers they have almost always been found to be decimal or\r\nquinary-decimal. The small number I have been able to collect are here\r\ngiven. They are somewhat fragmentary, but are as complete as it was\r\npossible to make them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AFFADEH.[338]\r\n\r\n    10.  dekang.\r\n    20.  degumm.\r\n    30.  piaske.\r\n    40.  tikkumgassih      = 20 × 2.\r\n    50.  tikkumgassigokang = 20 × 2 + 10.\r\n    60.  tikkumgakro       = 20 × 3.\r\n    70.  dungokrogokang    = 20 × 3 + 10.\r\n    80.  dukumgade         = 20 × 4.\r\n    90.  dukumgadegokang   = 20 × 4 + 10.\r\n   100.  miah (borrowed from the Arabs).\r\n\r\n\r\n  IBO.[339]\r\n\r\n    10.  iri.\r\n    20.  ogu.\r\n    30.  ogu n-iri    = 20 + 10,\r\n          or iri ato  = 10 × 3.\r\n    40.  ogu abuo     = 20 × 2,\r\n          or iri anno = 10 × 4.\r\n   100.  ogu ise      = 20 × 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VEI.[340]\r\n\r\n    10.  tan.\r\n    20.  mo bande         = a person finished.\r\n    30.  mo bande ako tan = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  mo fera bande    = 2 × 20.\r\n   100.  mo soru bande    = 5 persons finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n  YORUBA.[341]\r\n\r\n    10.  duup.\r\n    20.  ogu.\r\n    30.  ogbo.\r\n    40.  ogo-dzi = 20 × 2.\r\n    60.  ogo-ta  = 20 × 3.\r\n    80.  ogo-ri  = 20 × 4.\r\n   100.  ogo-ru  = 20 × 5.\r\n   120.  ogo-fa  = 20 × 6.\r\n   140.  ogo-dze = 20 × 7.\r\n   160.  ogo-dzo = 20 × 8, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n  EFIK.[342]\r\n\r\n    10.  duup.\r\n    20.  edip.\r\n    30.  edip-ye-duup = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  aba  = 20 × 2.\r\n    60.  ata  = 20 × 3.\r\n    80.  anan = 20 × 4.\r\n   100.  ikie.\r\n\r\nThe Yoruba scale, to which reference has already been made, p. 70, again\r\nshows its peculiar structure, by continuing its vigesimal formation past\r\n100 with no interruption in its method of numeral building.

It is remarkable that the\r\nnumber is no greater. Quinary counting is not uncommon in the \"Dark\r\nContinent,\" and there is no apparent reason why vigesimal reckoning should\r\nbe any less common than quinary. Any one investigating African modes of\r\ncounting with the material at present accessible, will find himself\r\nhampered by the fact that few explorers have collected any except the first\r\nten numerals. This leaves the formation of higher terms entirely unknown,\r\nand shows nothing beyond the quinary or non-quinary character of the\r\nsystem. Still, among those which Stanley, Schweinfurth, Salt, and others\r\nhave collected, by far the greatest number are decimal. As our knowledge of\r\nAfrican languages is extended, new examples of the vigesimal method may be\r\nbrought to light. But our present information leads us to believe that they\r\nwill be few in number.\r\n\r\nIn Asia the vigesimal system is to be found with greater frequency than in\r\nEurope or Africa, but it is still the exception. As Asiatic languages are\r\nmuch better known than African, it is probable that the future will add but\r\nlittle to our stock of knowledge on this point. New instances of counting\r\nby twenties may still be found in northern Siberia, where much ethnological\r\nwork yet remains to be done, and where a tendency toward this form of\r\nnumeration has been observed to exist. But the total number of Asiatic\r\nvigesimal scales must always remain small--quite insignificant in\r\ncomparison with those of decimal formation.\r\n\r\nIn the Caucasus region a group of languages is found, in which all but\r\nthree or four contain vigesimal systems.

In the even tens it is quite regularly decimal, unless 80 is of\r\nthe structure suggested above. On the other hand, the odd tens are formed\r\nin the ordinary vigesimal manner. The reason for this anomaly is not\r\nobvious. I know of no other number system that presents the same\r\npeculiarity, and cannot give any hypothesis which will satisfactorily\r\naccount for its presence here. In nearly all the examples given the decimal\r\nbecomes the leading element in the formation of all units above 100, just\r\nas was the case in the Celtic scales already noticed.\r\n\r\nAmong the northern tribes of Siberia the numeral scales appear to be ruder\r\nand less simple than those just examined, and the counting to be more\r\nconsistently vigesimal than in any scale we have thus far met with.

Below 20 it is quinary, and, however\r\nfar it might be extended, this quinary element would remain, making the\r\nscale quinary-vigesimal. But in another sense, also, the Aino system is not\r\npure. In any unmixed vigesimal scale the word for 400 must be a simple\r\nword, and that number must be taken as the vigesimal unit corresponding to\r\n100 in the decimal scale. But the Ainos have no simple numeral word for any\r\nnumber above 20, forming all higher numbers by combinations through one or\r\nmore of the processes of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The\r\nonly number above 20 which is used as a unit is 200, which is expressed\r\nmerely as 10 twenties. Any even number of hundreds, or any number of\r\nthousands, is then indicated as being so many times 10 twenties; and the\r\nodd hundreds are so many times 10 twenties, plus 5 twenties more. This\r\nscale is an excellent example of the cumbersome methods used by uncivilized\r\nraces in extending their number systems beyond the ordinary needs of daily\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn Central Asia a single vigesimal scale comes to light in the following\r\nfragment of the Leptscha scale, of the Himalaya region:[354]\r\n\r\n    10.  kati.\r\n    40.  kafali      = 4 × 10,\r\n          or kha nat = 2 × 20.\r\n    50.  kafano      = 5 × 10,\r\n          or kha nat sa kati = 2 × 20 + 10.\r\n   100.  gjo, or kat.\r\n\r\nFurther to the south, among the Dravidian races, the vigesimal element is\r\nalso found. The following will suffice to illustrate the number systems of\r\nthese dialects, which, as far as the material at hand shows, are different\r\nfrom each other only in minor particulars:\r\n\r\n\r\n  MUNDARI.[355]\r\n\r\n    10.  gelea.\r\n    20.  mi hisi.\r\n    30.  mi hisi gelea = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  bar hisi  = 2 × 20.\r\n    60.  api hisi  = 3 × 20.\r\n    80.  upun hisi = 4 × 20.\r\n   100.  mone hisi = 5 × 20.\r\n\r\nIn the Nicobar Islands of the Indian Ocean a well-developed example of\r\nvigesimal numeration is found. The inhabitants of these islands are so low\r\nin the scale of civilization that a definite numeral system of any kind is\r\na source of some surprise. Their neighbours, the Andaman Islanders, it will\r\nbe remembered, have but two numerals at their command; their intelligence\r\ndoes not seem in any way inferior to that of the Nicobar tribes, and one is\r\nat a loss to account for the superior development of the number sense in\r\nthe case of the latter. The intercourse of the coast tribes with traders\r\nmight furnish an explanation of the difficulty were it not for the fact\r\nthat the numeration of the inland tribes is quite as well developed as that\r\nof the coast tribes; and as the former never come in contact with traders\r\nand never engage in barter of any kind except in the most limited way, the\r\nconclusion seems inevitable that this is merely one of the phenomena of\r\nmental development among savage races for which we have at present no\r\nadequate explanation. The principal numerals of the inland and of the coast\r\ntribes are:[356]\r\n\r\n\r\n  INLAND TRIBES                        COAST TRIBES\r\n\r\n    10.  teya.                           10.  sham.\r\n    20.  heng-inai.                      20.  heang-inai.\r\n    30.  heng-inai-tain                  30.  heang-inai-tanai\r\n         = 20 + 5 (couples).                  = 20 + 5 (couples).\r\n    40.  au-inai   = 2 × 20.             40.  an-inai    = 2 × 20.\r\n   100.  tain-inai = 5 × 20.            100.  tanai-inai = 5 × 20.\r\n   200.  teya-inai = 10 × 20.           200.  sham-inai  = 10 × 20.\r\n   300.  teya-tain-inai                 300.  heang-tanai-inai\r\n         = (10 + 5) × 20.                     = (10 + 5) 20.\r\n   400.  heng-teo.                      400.  heang-momchiama.\r\n\r\nIn no other part of the world is vigesimal counting found so perfectly\r\ndeveloped, and, among native races, so generally preferred, as in North and\r\nSouth America. In the eastern portions of North America and in the extreme\r\nwestern portions of South America the decimal or the quinary decimal scale\r\nis in general use. But in the northern regions of North America, in western\r\nCanada and northwestern United States, in Mexico and Central America, and\r\nin the northern and western parts of South America, the unit of counting\r\namong the great majority of the native races was 20. The ethnological\r\naffinities of these races are not yet definitely ascertained; and it is no\r\npart of the scope of this work to enter into any discussion of that\r\ninvolved question. But either through contact or affinity, this form of\r\nnumeration spread in prehistoric times over half or more than half of the\r\nwestern hemisphere. It was the method employed by the rude Eskimos of the\r\nnorth and their equally rude kinsmen of Paraguay and eastern Brazil; by the\r\nforest Indians of Oregon and British Columbia, and by their more southern\r\nkinsmen, the wild tribes of the Rio Grande and of the Orinoco. And, most\r\nstriking and interesting of all, it was the method upon which were based\r\nthe numeral systems of the highly civilized races of Mexico, Yucatan, and\r\nNew Granada. Some of the systems obtained from the languages of these\r\npeoples are perfect, extended examples of vigesimal counting, not to be\r\nduplicated in any other quarter of the globe. The ordinary unit was, as\r\nwould be expected, \"one man,\" and in numerous languages the words for 20\r\nand man are identical. But in other cases the original meaning of that\r\nnumeral word has been lost; and in others still it has a signification\r\nquite remote from that given above. These meanings will be noticed in\r\nconnection with the scales themselves, which are given, roughly speaking,\r\nin their geographical order, beginning with the Eskimo of the far north.\r\nThe systems of some of the tribes are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ALASKAN ESKIMOS.[357]\r\n\r\n    10.  koleet.\r\n    20.  enuenok.\r\n    30.  enuenok kolinik   = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  malho kepe ak     = 2 × 20.\r\n    50.  malho-kepe ak-kolmik che pah ak to = 2 × 20 + 10.\r\n    60.  pingi shu-kepe ak = 3 × 20.\r\n   100.  tale ma-kepe ak   = 5 × 20.\r\n   400.  enue nok ke pe ak = 20 × 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TCHIGLIT.[358]\r\n\r\n    10.  krolit.\r\n    20.  kroleti, or innun = man.\r\n    30.  innok krolinik-tchikpalik = man + 2 hands.\r\n    40.  innum mallerok   = 2 men.\r\n    50.  adjigaynarmitoat = as many times 10 as the fingers of the hand.\r\n    60.  innumipit        = 3 men.\r\n    70.  innunmalloeronik arveneloerit = 7 men?\r\n    80.  innun pinatçunik arveneloerit = 8 men?\r\n    90.  innun tcitamanik arveneloerit = 9 men?\r\n   100.  itchangnerkr.\r\n  1000.  itchangner-park = great 100.\r\n\r\nThe meanings for 70, 80, 90, are not given by Father Petitot, but are of\r\nsuch a form that the significations seem to be what are given above. Only a\r\nfull acquaintance with the Tchiglit language would justify one in giving\r\ndefinite meanings to these words, or in asserting that an error had been\r\nmade in the numerals. But it is so remarkable and anomalous to find the\r\ndecimal and vigesimal scales mingled in this manner that one involuntarily\r\nsuspects either incompleteness of form, or an actual mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TLINGIT.[359]\r\n\r\n    10.  djinkat = both hands?\r\n    20.  tle ka  = 1 man.\r\n    30.  natsk djinkat  = 3 × 10.\r\n    40.  dak'on djinkat = 4 × 10.\r\n    50.  kedjin djinkat = 5 × 10.\r\n    60.  tle durcu djinkat    = 6 × 10.\r\n    70.  daqa durcu djinkat   = 7 × 10.\r\n    80.  natska durcu djinkat = 8 × 10.\r\n    90.  gocuk durcu djinkat  = 9 × 10.\r\n   100.  kedjin ka  = 5 men, or 5 × 20.\r\n   200.  djinkat ka = 10 × 20.\r\n   300.  natsk djinkat ka  = 30 men.\r\n   400.  dak'on djinkat ka = 40 men.\r\n\r\nThis scale contains a strange commingling of decimal and vigesimal\r\ncounting. The words for 20, 100, and 200 are clear evidence of vigesimal,\r\nwhile 30 to 90, and the remaining hundreds, are equally unmistakable proof\r\nof decimal, numeration. The word _ka_, man, seems to mean either 10 or 20;\r\na most unusual occurrence. The fact that a number system is partly decimal\r\nand partly vigesimal is found to be of such frequent occurrence that this\r\npoint in the Tlingit scale need excite no special wonder. But it is\r\nremarkable that the same word should enter into numeral composition under\r\nsuch different meanings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOOTKA.[360]\r\n\r\n    10.  haiu.\r\n    20.  tsakeits.\r\n    30.  tsakeits ic haiu = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  atlek    = 2 × 20.\r\n    60.  katstsek = 3 × 20.\r\n    80.  moyek    = 4 × 20.\r\n   100.  sutc'ek  = 5 × 20.\r\n   120.  nop'ok   = 6 × 20.\r\n   140.  atlpok   = 7 × 20.\r\n   160.  atlakutlek = 8 × 20.\r\n   180.  ts'owakutlek = 9 × 20.\r\n   200.  haiuk    = 10 × 20.\r\n\r\nThis scale is quinary-vigesimal, with no apparent decimal element in its\r\ncomposition. But the derivation of some of the terms used is detected with\r\ndifficulty. In the following scale the vigesimal structure is still more\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TSIMSHIAN.[361]\r\n\r\n    10.  gy'ap.\r\n    20.  kyedeel = 1 man.\r\n    30.  gulewulgy'ap.\r\n    40.  t'epqadalgyitk, or tqalpqwulgyap.\r\n    50.  kctoncwulgyap.\r\n   100.  kcenecal.\r\n   200.  k'pal.\r\n   300.  k'pal te kcenecal = 200 + 100.\r\n   400.  kyedal.\r\n   500.  kyedal te kcenecal = 400 + 100.\r\n   600.  gulalegyitk.\r\n   700.  gulalegyitk te kcenecal = 600 + 100.\r\n   800.  tqalpqtalegyitk.\r\n   900.  tqalpqtalegyitk te kcenecal = 800 + 100.\r\n  1000.  k'pal.\r\n\r\nTo the unobservant eye this scale would certainly appear to contain no more\r\nthan a trace of the vigesimal in its structure. But Dr. Boas, who is one of\r\nthe most careful and accurate of investigators, says in his comment on this\r\nsystem: \"It will be seen at once that this system is quinary-vigesimal....\r\nIn 20 we find the word _gyat_, man. The hundreds are identical with the\r\nnumerals used in counting men (see p. 87), and then the quinary-vigesimal\r\nsystem is most evident.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  RIO NORTE INDIANS.[362]\r\n\r\n    20.  taiguaco.\r\n    30.  taiguaco co juyopamauj ajte = 20 + 2 × 5.\r\n    40.  taiguaco ajte = 20 × 2.\r\n    50.  taiguaco ajte co juyopamauj ajte = 20 × 2 + 5 × 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CARIBS OF ESSIQUIBO, GUIANA\r\n\r\n    10.  oween-abatoro.\r\n    20.  owee-carena   = 1 person.\r\n    40.  oko-carena    = 2 persons.\r\n    60.  oroowa-carena = 3 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n  OTOMI\r\n\r\n    10.  ra-tta.\r\n    20.  na-te.\r\n    30.  na-te-m'a-ratta = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  yo-te           = 2 × 30.\r\n    50.  yote-m'a-ratta  = 2 × 20 + 10.\r\n    60.  hiu-te          = 3 × 20.\r\n    70.  hiute-m'a-ratta = 3 × 20 + 10.\r\n    80.  gooho-rate      = 4 × 20.\r\n    90.  gooho-rate-m'a ratta = 4 × 20 + 10.\r\n   100.  cytta-te        = 5 × 20,\r\n          or nanthebe    = 1 × 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MAYA, YUCATAN.[363]\r\n\r\n           1.  hun.\r\n          10.  lahun  = it is finished.\r\n          20.  hunkal = a measure, or more correctly, a fastening together.\r\n          30.  lahucakal   = 40 - 10?\r\n          40.  cakal       = 2 × 20.\r\n          50.  lahuyoxkal  = 60 - 10.\r\n          60.  oxkal       = 3 × 20.\r\n          70.  lahucankal  = 80 - 10.\r\n          80.  cankal      = 4 × 20.\r\n          90.  lahuyokal   = 100 - 10.\r\n         100.  hokal       = 5 × 20.\r\n         110.  lahu uackal = 120 - 10.\r\n         120.  uackal      = 6 × 20.\r\n         130.  lahu uuckal = 140 - 10.\r\n         140.  uuckal      = 7 × 20.\r\n         200.  lahuncal    = 10 × 20.\r\n         300.  holhukal    = 15 × 20.\r\n         400.  hunbak      = 1 tying around.\r\n         500.  hotubak.\r\n         600.  lahutubak\r\n         800.  calbak = 2 × 400.\r\n         900.  hotu yoxbak.\r\n        1000.  lahuyoxbak.\r\n        1200.  oxbak = 3 × 400.\r\n        2000.  capic (modern).\r\n        8000.  hunpic = 1 sack.\r\n      16,000.  ca pic (ancient).\r\n     160,000.  calab = a filling full\r\n   3,200,000.  kinchil.\r\n  64,000,000.  hunalau.\r\n\r\nIn the Maya scale we have one of the best and most extended examples of\r\nvigesimal numeration ever developed by any race. To show in a more striking\r\nand forcible manner the perfect regularity of the system, the following\r\ntabulation is made of the various Maya units, which will correspond to the\r\n\"10 units make one ten, 10 tens make one hundred, 10 hundreds make one\r\nthousand,\" etc., which old-fashioned arithmetic compelled us to learn in\r\nchildhood. The scale is just as regular by twenties in Maya as by tens in\r\nEnglish. It is[364]\r\n\r\n  20 hun     = 1 kal          =         20.\r\n  20 kal     = 1 bak          =        400.\r\n  20 bak     = 1 pic          =       8000.\r\n  20 pic     = 1 calab        =    160,000.\r\n  20 calab   = 1 { kinchil  } =  3,200,000.\r\n                 { tzotzceh }\r\n  20 kinchil = 1 alau         = 64,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe original meaning of _pic_, given in the scale as \"a sack,\" was rather\r\n\"a short petticoat, somtimes used as a sack.\" The word _tzotzceh_ signified\r\n\"deerskin.\" No reason can be given for the choice of this word as a\r\nnumeral, though the appropriateness of the others is sufficiently manifest.\r\nNo evidence of digital numeration appears in the first 10 units, but,\r\njudging from the almost universal practice of the Indian tribes of both\r\nNorth and South America, such may readily have been the origin of Maya\r\ncounting. Whatever its origin, it certainly expanded and grew into a system\r\nwhose perfection challenges our admiration. It was worthy of the splendid\r\ncivilization of this unfortunate race, and, through its simplicity and\r\nregularity, bears ample testimony to the intellectual capacity which\r\noriginated it.\r\n\r\nThe only example of vigesimal reckoning which is comparable with that of\r\nthe Mayas is the system employed by their northern neighbours, the Nahuatl,\r\nor, as they are more commonly designated, the Aztecs of Mexico. This system\r\nis quite as pure and quite as simple as the Maya, but differs from it in\r\nsome important particulars. In its first 20 numerals it is quinary (see p.\r\n141), and as a system must be regarded as quinary-vigesimal. The Maya scale\r\nis decimal through its first 20 numerals, and, if it is to be regarded as a\r\nmixed scale, must be characterized as decimal-vigesimal. But in both these\r\ninstances the vigesimal element preponderates so strongly that these, in\r\ncommon with their kindred number systems of Mexico, Yucatan, and Central\r\nAmerica, are always thought of and alluded to as vigesimal scales. On\r\naccount of its importance, the Nahuatl system[365] is given in fuller\r\ndetail than most of the other systems I have made use of.\r\n\r\n          10.  matlactli = 2 hands.\r\n          20.  cempoalli = 1 counting.\r\n          21.  cempoalli once  = 20-1.\r\n          22.  cempoalli omome = 20-2.\r\n          30.  cempoalli ommatlactli      = 20-10.\r\n          31.  cempoalli ommatlactli once = 20-10-1.\r\n          40.  ompoalli               = 2 × 20.\r\n          50.  ompoalli ommatlactli   = 40-10.\r\n          60.  eipoalli, or epoalli,  = 3 × 20.\r\n          70.  epoalli ommatlactli    = 60-10.\r\n          80.  nauhpoalli             = 4 × 20.\r\n          90.  nauhpoalli ommatlactli = 90-10.\r\n         100.  macuilpoalli    = 5 × 20.\r\n         120.  chiquacempoalli = 6 × 20.\r\n         140.  chicompoalli    = 7 × 20.\r\n         160.  chicuepoalli    = 8 × 20.\r\n         180.  chiconauhpoalli = 9 × 20.\r\n         200.  matlacpoalli    = 10 × 20.\r\n         220.  matlactli oncempoalli  = 11 × 20.\r\n         240.  matlactli omompoalli   = 12 × 20.\r\n         260.  matlactli omeipoalli   = 13 × 20.\r\n         280.  matlactli onnauhpoalli = 14 × 20.\r\n         300.  caxtolpoalli           = 15 × 20.\r\n         320.  caxtolli oncempoalli.\r\n         399.  caxtolli onnauhpoalli ipan caxtolli onnaui = 19 × 20 + 19.\r\n         400.  centzontli = 1 bunch of grass, or 1 tuft of hair.\r\n         800.  ometzontli = 2 × 400.\r\n        1200.  eitzontli  = 3 × 400.\r\n        7600.  caxtolli onnauhtzontli = 19 × 400.\r\n        8000.  cenxiquipilli, or cexiquipilli.\r\n     160,000.  cempoalxiquipilli      = 20 × 8000.\r\n   3,200,000.  centzonxiquipilli      = 400 × 8000.\r\n  64,000,000.  cempoaltzonxiquipilli  = 20 × 400 × 8000.\r\n\r\nUp to 160,000 the Nahuatl system is as simple and regular in its\r\nconstruction as the English. But at this point it fails in the formation of\r\na new unit, or rather in the expression of its new unit by a simple word;\r\nand in the expression of all higher numbers it is forced to resort in some\r\nmeasure to compound terms, just as the English might have done had it not\r\nbeen able to borrow from the Italian. The higher numeral terms, under such\r\nconditions, rapidly become complex and cumbersome, as the following\r\nanalysis of the number 1,279,999,999 shows.[366] The analysis will be\r\nreadily understood when it is remembered that _ipan_ signifies plus.\r\n_Caxtolli onnauhpoaltzonxiquipilli ipan caxtolli onnauhtzonxiquipilli ipan\r\ncaxtolli onnauhpoalxiquipilli ipan caxtolli onnauhxiquipilli ipan caxtolli\r\nonnauhtzontli ipan caxtolli onnauhpoalli ipan caxtolli onnaui;_ _i.e._\r\n1,216,000,000 + 60,800,000  + 3,040,000 + 152,000 + 7600 + 380 + 19. To\r\nshow the compounding which takes place in the higher numerals, the analysis\r\nmay be made more literally, thus:  + (15 + 4) × 400 × 800 + (15 + 4) × 20 ×\r\n8000 + (15  + 4) × 8000 + (15 + 4) × 400 + (15 + 4) × 20 + 15  + 4. Of\r\ncourse this resolution suffers from the fact that it is given in digits\r\narranged in accordance with decimal notation, while the Nahuatl numerals\r\nexpress values by a base twice as great. This gives the effect of a\r\ncomplexity and awkwardness greater than really existed in the actual use of\r\nthe scale. Except for the presence of the quinary element the number just\r\ngiven is really expressed with just as great simplicity as it could be in\r\nEnglish words if our words \"million\" and \"billion\" were replaced by\r\n\"thousand thousand\" and \"thousand thousand thousand.\" If Mexico had\r\nremained undisturbed by Europeans, and science and commerce had been left\r\nto their natural growth and development, uncompounded words would\r\nundoubtedly have been found for the higher units, 160,000, 3,200,000, etc.,\r\nand the system thus rendered as simple as it is possible for a\r\nquinary-vigesimal system to be.\r\n\r\nOther number scales of this region are given as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  HUASTECA.[367]\r\n\r\n    10.  laluh.\r\n    20.  hum-inic       = 1 man.\r\n    30.  hum-inic-lahu  = 1 man 10.\r\n    40.  tzab-inic      = 2 men.\r\n    50.  tzab-inic-lahu = 2 men 10.\r\n    60.  ox-inic        = 3 men.\r\n    70.  ox-inic-lahu   = 3 men 10.\r\n    80.  tze-tnic       = 4 men.\r\n    90.  tze-ynic-kal-laluh = 4 men and 10.\r\n   100.  bo-inic        = 5 men.\r\n   200.  tzab-bo-inic   = 2 × 5 men.\r\n   300.  ox-bo-inic     = 3 × 5 men.\r\n   400.  tsa-bo-inic    = 4 × 5 men.\r\n   600.  acac-bo-inic   = 6 × 5 men.\r\n   800.  huaxic-bo-inic = 8 × 5 men.\r\n  1000.  xi.\r\n  8000.  huaxic-xi = 8-1000.\r\n\r\nThe essentially vigesimal character of this system changes in the formation\r\nof some of the higher numerals, and a suspicion of the decimal enters. One\r\nhundred is _boinic_, 5 men; but 200, instead of being simply _lahuh-inic_,\r\n10 men, is _tsa-bo-inic_, 2 × 100, or more strictly, 2 times 5 men.\r\nSimilarly, 300 is 3 × 100, 400 is 4 × 100, etc. The word for 1000 is simple\r\ninstead of compound, and the thousands appear to be formed wholly on the\r\ndecimal base. A comparison of this scale with that of the Nahuatl shows how\r\nmuch inferior it is to the latter, both in simplicity and consistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TOTONACO.[368]\r\n\r\n    10.  cauh.\r\n    20.  puxam.\r\n    30.  puxamacauh    = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  tipuxam       = 2 × 20.\r\n    50.  tipuxamacauh  = 40 + 10.\r\n    60.  totonpuxam    = 3 × 20.\r\n   100.  quitziz puxum = 5 × 20.\r\n   200.  copuxam       = 10 × 20.\r\n   400.  tontaman.\r\n  1000.  titamanacopuxam = 2 × 400 + 200.\r\n\r\nThe essential character of the vigesimal element is shown by the last two\r\nnumerals. _Tontamen_, the square of 20, is a simple word, and 1000 is, as\r\nit should be, 2 times 400, plus 200. It is most unfortunate that the\r\nnumeral for 8000, the cube of 20, is not given.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CORA.[369]\r\n\r\n    10.  tamoamata.\r\n    20.  cei-tevi.\r\n    30.  ceitevi apoan tamoamata = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  huapoa-tevi  = 2 × 20.\r\n    60.  huaeica-tevi = 3 × 20.\r\n   100.  anxu-tevi    = 5 × 20.\r\n   400.  ceitevi-tevi = 20 × 20.\r\n\r\nClosely allied with the Maya numerals and method of counting are those of\r\nthe Quiches of Guatemala. The resemblance is so obvious that no detail in\r\nthe Quiche scale calls for special mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n  QUICHE.[370]\r\n\r\n    10.  lahuh.\r\n    20.  hu-uinac       = 1 man.\r\n    30.  hu-uinac-lahuh = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  ca-uinac       = 2 men.\r\n    50.  lahu-r-ox-kal  = -10 + 3 × 20.\r\n    60.  ox-kal         = 3 × 20.\r\n    70.  lahu-u-humuch  = -10 + 80.\r\n    80.  humuch.\r\n    90.  lahu-r-ho-kal  = -10 + 100.\r\n   100.  hokal.\r\n  1000.  o-tuc-rox-o-kal.\r\n\r\nAmong South American vigesimal systems, the best known is that of the\r\nChibchas or Muyscas of the Bogota region, which was obtained at an early\r\ndate by the missionaries who laboured among them. This system is much less\r\nextensive than that of some of the more northern races; but it is as\r\nextensive as almost any other South American system with the exception of\r\nthe Peruvian, which was, however, a pure decimal system. As has already\r\nbeen stated, the native races of South America were, as a rule, exceedingly\r\ndeficient in regard to the number sense. Their scales are rude, and show\r\ngreat poverty, both in formation of numeral words and in the actual extent\r\nto which counting was carried. If extended as far as 20, these scales are\r\nlikely to become vigesimal, but many stop far short of that limit, and no\r\ninconsiderable number of them fail to reach even 5. In this respect we are\r\nreminded of the Australian scales, which were so rudimentary as really to\r\npreclude any proper use of the word \"system\" in connection with them.\r\nCounting among the South American tribes was often equally limited, and\r\neven less regular. Following are the significant numerals of the scale in\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHIBCHA, OR MUYSCA.[371]\r\n\r\n    10.  hubchibica.\r\n    20.  quihica ubchihica = thus says the foot, 10 = 10-10,\r\n          or gueta         = house.\r\n    30.  guetas asaqui ubchihica = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  gue-bosa    = 20 × 2.\r\n    60.  gue-mica    = 20 × 3.\r\n    80.  gue-muyhica = 20 × 4.\r\n   100.  gue-hisca   = 20 × 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NAGRANDA.[372]\r\n\r\n    10.  guha.\r\n    20.  dino.\r\n    30.  'badiñoguhanu = 20 + 10.\r\n    40.  apudiño       = 2 × 20.\r\n    50.  apudiñoguhanu = 2 × 20 + 10.\r\n    60.  asudiño       = 3 × 20.\r\n    70.  asudiñoguhanu = 3 × 20 + 10.\r\n    80.  acudiño       = 4 × 20.\r\n    90.  acudiñoguhanu = 4 × 20 + 10.\r\n   100.  huisudiño     = 5 × 20,\r\n          or guhamba   = great 10.\r\n   200.  guahadiño     = 10 × 20.\r\n   400.  diñoamba      = great 20.\r\n  1000.  guhaisudiño   = 10 × 5 × 20.\r\n  2000.  hisudiñoamba  = 5 great 20's.\r\n  4000.  guhadiñoamba  = 10 great 20's.\r\n\r\nIn considering the influence on the manners and customs of any people which\r\ncould properly be ascribed to the use among them of any other base than 10,\r\nit must not be forgotten that no races, save those using that base, have\r\never attained any great degree of civilization, with the exception of the\r\nancient Aztecs and their immediate neighbours, north and south. For reasons\r\nalready pointed out, no highly civilized race has ever used an exclusively\r\nquinary system; and all that can be said of the influence of this mode of\r\ncounting is that it gives rise to the habit of collecting objects in groups\r\nof five, rather than of ten, when any attempt is being made to ascertain\r\ntheir sum. In the case of the subsidiary base 12, for which the Teutonic\r\nraces have always shown such a fondness, the dozen and gross of commerce,\r\nthe divisions of English money, and of our common weights and measures are\r\nprobably an outgrowth of this preference; and the Babylonian base, 60, has\r\nfastened upon the world forever a sexagesimal method of dividing time, and\r\nof measuring the circumference of the circle.\r\n\r\nThe advanced civilization attained by the races of Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica render it possible to see some of the effects of vigesimal\r\ncounting, just as a single thought will show how our entire lives are\r\ninfluenced by our habit of counting by tens. Among the Aztecs the universal\r\nunit was 20. A load of cloaks, of dresses, or other articles of convenient\r\nsize, was 20. Time was divided into periods of 20 days each. The armies\r\nwere numbered by divisions of 8000;[373] and in countless other ways the\r\nvigesimal element of numbers entered into their lives, just as the decimal\r\nenters into ours; and it is to be supposed that they found it as useful and\r\nas convenient for all measuring purposes as we find our own system; as the\r\ntradesman of to-day finds the duodecimal system of commerce; or as the\r\nBabylonians of old found that singularly curious system, the sexagesimal.\r\nHabituation, the laws which the habits and customs of every-day life impose\r\nupon us, are so powerful, that our instinctive readiness to make use of any\r\nconcept depends, not on the intrinsic perfection or imperfection which\r\npertains to it, but on the familiarity with which previous use has invested\r\nit. Hence, while one race may use a decimal, another a quinary-vigesimal,\r\nand another a sexagesimal scale, and while one system may actually be\r\ninherently superior to another, no user of one method of reckoning need\r\never think of any other method as possessing practical inconveniences, of\r\nwhich those employing it are ever conscious. And, to cite a single instance\r\nwhich illustrates the unconscious daily use of two modes of reckoning in\r\none scale, we have only to think of the singular vigesimal fragment which\r\nremains to this day imbedded in the numeral scale of the French. In\r\ncounting from 70 to 100, or in using any number which lies between those\r\nlimits, no Frenchman is conscious of employing a method of numeration less\r\nsimple or less convenient in any particular, than when he is at work with\r\nthe strictly decimal portions of his scale. He passes from the one style of\r\ncounting to the other, and from the second back to the first again,\r\nentirely unconscious of any break or change; entirely unconscious, in fact,\r\nthat he is using any particular system, except that which the daily habit\r\nof years has made a part himself.\r\n\r\nDeep regret must be felt by every student of philology, that the primitive\r\nmeanings of simple numerals have been so generally lost. But, just as the\r\npebble on the beach has been worn and rounded by the beating of the waves\r\nand by other pebbles, until no trace of its original form is left, and\r\nuntil we can say of it now only that it is quartz, or that it is diorite,\r\nso too the numerals of many languages have suffered from the attrition of\r\nthe ages, until all semblance of their origin has been lost, and we can say\r\nof them only that they are numerals. Beyond a certain point we can carry\r\nthe study neither of number nor of number words. At that point both the\r\nmathematician and the philologist must pause, and leave everything beyond\r\nto the speculations of those who delight in nothing else so much as in pure\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam, L., 44, 159, 166, 175.\r\nArmstrong, R.A., 180.\r\nAymonier, A., 156.\r\n\r\nBachofen, J.J., 131.\r\nBalbi, A., 151.\r\nBancroft, H.H., 29, 47, 89, 93, 113, 199.\r\nBarlow, H., 108.\r\nBeauregard, O., 45, 83, 152.\r\nBellamy, E.W., 9.\r\nBoas, F., 30, 45, 46, 65, 87, 88, 136, 163, 164, 171, 197, 198.\r\nBonwick, J., 24, 27, 107, 108.\r\nBrinton, D.G., 2, 22, 46, 52, 57, 61, 111, 112, 140, 199, 200.\r\nBurton, R.F., 37, 71.\r\n\r\nChamberlain, A.F., 45, 65, 93.\r\nChase, P.E., 99.\r\nClarke, H., 113.\r\nCodrington, R.H., 16, 95, 96, 136, 138, 145, 153, 154.\r\nCrawfurd, J., 89, 93, 130.\r\nCurr, E.M., 24-27, 104, 107-110, 112.\r\nCushing, F.H., 13, 48.\r\n\r\nDe Flacourt, 8, 9.\r\nDe Quincey, T., 35.\r\nDeschamps, M., 28.\r\nDobrizhoffer, M., 71.\r\nDorsey, J.O., 59.\r\nDu Chaillu, P.B., 66, 67, 150, 151.\r\nDu Graty, A.M., 138.\r\n\r\nEllis, A.A., 64, 91.\r\nEllis, R., 37, 142.\r\nEllis, W., 83, 119.\r\nErskine, J.E., 153, 154.\r\n\r\nFlegel, R., 133.\r\n\r\nGallatin, A., 136, 159, 166, 171, 199, 204, 206, 208.\r\nGalton, F., 4.\r\nGatschet, A.S., 58, 59, 68.\r\nGilij, F.S., 54.\r\nGill, W.W., 18, 118.\r\nGoedel, M., 83, 147.\r\nGrimm, J.L.C., 48.\r\nGröber, G., 182.\r\nGuillome, J., 181.\r\n\r\nHaddon, A.C., 18, 105.\r\nHale, H., 61, 65, 93, 114-116, 122, 130, 156, 163, 164, 171.\r\nHankel, H., 137.\r\nHaumonté, J.D., 44.\r\nHervas, L., 170.\r\nHumboldt, A. von, 32, 207.\r\nHyades, M., 22.\r\n\r\nKelly, J.W., 157, 196.\r\nKelly, J., 180.\r\nKleinschmidt, S., 52, 80.\r\n\r\nLang, J.D., 108.\r\nLappenberg, J.M., 127.\r\nLatham, R.G., 24, 67, 107.\r\nLeibnitz, G.W. von, 102, 103.\r\nLloyd, H.E., 7.\r\nLong, C.C., 148, 186.\r\nLong, S.H., 121.\r\nLubbock, Sir J., 3, 5.\r\nLull, E.P., 79.\r\n\r\nMacdonald, J., 15.\r\nMackenzie, A., 26.\r\nMan, E.H., 28, 194.\r\nMann, A., 47.\r\nMarcoy, P.

The next three\r\nscales are from the same page of this work.\r\n\r\n[286] Codrington, _Melanesian Languages_, p. 235. The next four scales are\r\nfrom the same page. Perhaps the meanings of the words for 6 to 9 are more\r\nproperly \"more 1,\" \"more 2,\" etc. Codrington merely indicates their\r\nsignifications in a general way.\r\n\r\n[287] Hale, _Ethnography and Philology_, p. 429. The meanings of 6 to 9 in\r\nthis and the preceding are my conjectures.\r\n\r\n[288] Müller, _Sprachwissenschaft_, IV. i. p. 124.\r\n\r\n[289] Aymonier, E., _Dictionnaire Francaise-Cambodgien_.\r\n\r\n[290] Müller, _Op. cit._, II. i. p. 139.\r\n\r\n[291] Müller, _Sprachwissenschaft_, II. i. p. 123.\r\n\r\n[292] Wells, E.R., Jr., and John W.

Am. Antq. Soc._, 1836,\r\np. 358. The next fourteen lists are, with the exception of the Micmac, from\r\nthe same collection. The meanings are largely from Trumbull, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n[300] Schoolcraft, _Archives of Aboriginal Knowledge_, Vol. II. p. 211.\r\n\r\n[301] Schoolcraft, _Archives of Aboriginal Knowledge_, Vol. V. p. 587.\r\n\r\n[302] In the Dakota dialects 10 is expressed, as here, by a word signifying\r\nthat the fingers, which have been bent down in counting, are now\r\nstraightened out.\r\n\r\n[303] Boas, _Fifth Report B.A.A.S._, 1889. Reprint, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[304] Boas, _Sixth Report B.A.A.S._, 1890. Reprint, p. 117. Dr. Boas does\r\nnot give the meanings assigned to 7 and 8, but merely states that they are\r\nderived from 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n[305] _Op. cit._, p. 117. The derivations for 6 and 7 are obvious, but the\r\nmeanings are conjectural.\r\n\r\n[306] Boas, _Sixth Report B.A.A.S._, 1889. Reprint, pp. 158, 160. The\r\nmeanings assigned to the Tsimshian 8 and to Bilqula 6 to 8 are conjectural.\r\n\r\n[307] Hale, _Ethnography and Philology_, p. 619.\r\n\r\n[308] _Op. cit._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[309] Hale, _Ethnography and Philology_, p. 619.\r\n\r\n[310] Müller, _Sprachwissenschaft_, II. i. p. 436.\r\n\r\n[311] _Op. cit._, IV. i. p. 167.\r\n\r\n[312] _Op. cit._, II. i. p. 282.\r\n\r\n[313] _Op. cit._, II. i. p. 287. The meanings given for the words for 7, 8,\r\n9 are conjectures of my own.\r\n\r\n[314] Müller, _Sprachwissenschaft_, II. i. p. 297.\r\n\r\n[315] Pott, _Zählmethode_, p. 90.\r\n\r\n[316] Müller, _op. cit._, II. i. p. 379.\r\n\r\n[317] Gallatin, \"Semi-Civilized Nations of Mexico and Central America,\"\r\n_Tr.

I can only guess at the\r\nmeanings of 6 to 9. They are obviously circumlocutions for 5-1, 5-2, etc.\r\n\r\n[320] _Op. cit._, p. 438. Müller has transposed these two scales. See\r\nBrinton's _Am. Race_, p. 358.\r\n\r\n[321] Marcoy, P., _Tour du Monde_, 1866, 2ème sem. p. 148.\r\n\r\n[322] _Op. cit._, p. 132. The meanings are my own conjectures.\r\n\r\n[323] An elaborate argument in support of this theory is to be found in\r\nHervas' celebrated work, _Arithmetica di quasi tutte le nazioni\r\nconosciute_.\r\n\r\n[324] See especially the lists of Hale, Gallatin, Trumbull, and Boas, to\r\nwhich references have been given above.\r\n\r\n[325] Thiel, B.A., \"Vocab. der Indianier in Costa Rica,\" _Archiv für\r\nAnth._, xvi. p. 620.\r\n\r\n[326] These three examples are from A.R.
