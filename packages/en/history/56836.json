This book is written because I feel\r\nthat the result of my research brings a new point of view to the student\r\nof the twentieth-century problems of the Near East, as well as to those\r\nwho are interested in fourteenth-century Europe. If we study the past,\r\nit is to understand the present and to prepare for the future.\r\n\r\nI plead guilty to many footnotes. Much of my text is controversial in\r\ncharacter, and the subject-matter is so little known that the general\r\nreader would hardly be able to form judgements without a constant--but I\r\ntrust not wearisome--reference to authorities.\r\n\r\nThe risk that I run of incurring criticism from Oriental philologists on\r\nthe ground of nomenclature is very great. I ask their indulgence. Will\r\nthey not take into consideration the fact that there is no accepted\r\nstandard among English-speaking scholars for the transliteration of\r\nTurkish and Slavic names? Wherever possible, I have adopted the spelling\r\nin general usage in the Near East, and in English standard lexicons and\r\nencyclopaedias. When a general usage cannot be determined, I have\r\nfrequently been at a loss.\r\n\r\nThere was the effort to be as consistent in spelling as sources and\r\nauthorities would permit. But where consistency was lacking in\r\noriginals, a consistent transliteration sometimes presented difficulties\r\nwith which I was incompetent to cope. Even a philologist, with a system,\r\nwould be puzzled when he found his sources conflicting with each other\r\nin spelling, and--as is often the case--with themselves. And if a\r\nphilologist thinks that he can establish his system by transliterating\r\nthe _spoken_ word, let him travel from Constantinople to Cairo overland,\r\nand he will have a bewildering collection of variants before he reaches\r\nhis journey’s end. I was not long in Turkey before I learned that\r\n_Osman_ and _Othman_ were both correct. It depended merely upon whether\r\nyou were in Constantinople or Konia! After you had decided to accept the\r\npronunciation of the capital, you were told that Konia is the Tours of\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nMy acknowledgements to kind friends are many. I am grateful for the\r\nyear-in and year-out patience and willingness of the officials of the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale during long periods of constant demand upon their\r\ntime and attention. Professors John De Witt, D.D., LL.D., of Princeton\r\nTheological Seminary, Duncan B. Macdonald, Ph.D., of Hartford\r\nTheological Seminary, and Edward P. Cheyney, Ph.D., LL.D., of the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, have read portions of the manuscript, and\r\nhave made important and helpful suggestions. The whole manuscript has\r\nbeen read by Professors Talcott Williams, LL.D., of Columbia University,\r\nand R. M. McElroy, Ph.D., of Princeton University, who have not\r\nhesitated to give many hours to discussion and criticism of the theory\r\nthat the book presents.\r\n\r\nAbove all, I am indebted for practical aid and encouragement in\r\nresearch and in writing, from the inception of the idea of the book\r\nuntil the manuscript went to press, to my wife, with her Bryn Mawr\r\ninsistence upon accuracy of detail and care for form of narrative, and\r\nto Alexander Souter, D.Litt., Regius Professor of Humanity in Aberdeen\r\nUniversity, my two comrades in research through a succession of happy\r\nyears in the rue de Richelieu, rue Servandoni, and rue du Montparnasse\r\nof the queen city of the world.\r\n\r\nH.

The Constantinople terminus\r\nof the Anatolian Railway is at Haïdar Pasha, on the Asiatic shore, where\r\nthe Bosphorus opens into the Sea of Marmora. Three hours along the Gulf\r\nof Ismidt, past the Princes’ Islands, brings one to Ismidt, the ancient\r\nNicomedia, eastern capital of the Roman Empire under Diocletian. It is\r\nat the very end of the gulf. From Ismidt, the railway crosses a fertile\r\nplain, coasts the western shore of Lake Sabandja, and enters the valley\r\nof the Sangarius as far as Lefké. Here it turns southward, and mounts\r\nrapidly the course of the Kara Su, a tributary of the Sangarius, through\r\nthe picturesque town of Biledjik, to a plateau, at the north-western end\r\nof which is Eski Sheïr, seven hours distant from Ismidt. Eski Sheïr is\r\nthe ancient Dorylaeum. It was here that Godfrey de Bouillon in 1097 won\r\nfrom the Turks the victory that opened for his Crusaders the way through\r\nAsia Minor.\r\n\r\nFrom Eski Sheïr there are two railway lines. One, running eastward, has\r\nits terminus at Angora, the ancient Ancyra, after thirteen hours of\r\nrather slow running. The other, the main line, runs south to Afion Kara\r\nHissar, where the line from Smyrna joins it, and then south-west to\r\nKonia, the ancient Iconium, which is the western terminus of the new\r\nBagdad Railway. The time from Eski Sheïr to Konia is fifteen hours.\r\n\r\nFrom Lefké or from Mekedjé, near the junction of the Kara Su and the\r\nSangarius, one can drive in four hours west to Isnik (ancient Nicaea),\r\nor in twelve hours to Brusa, which lies at the foot of Keshish Dagh\r\n(Mount Olympus). Between Lefké and Eski Sheïr, where the railway begins\r\nto mount above the river-bed of the Kara Su, is Biledjik. Between Eski\r\nSheïr and Biledjik is Sugut. West from Eski Sheïr, six hours on horse\r\nacross one low mountain range, lies Inoenu. South from Eski Sheïr, a day\r\nby carriage, is Kutayia. There is a short branch line of the Anatolian\r\nRailway to Kutayia from Alayund, two and a half hours beyond Eski Sheïr\r\non the way to Konia.\r\n\r\nIf one will read the above paragraphs with a map before him, he will\r\nreadily see that this country, the extreme north-western corner of Asia\r\nMinor, corresponds roughly to the borderland between the Roman provinces\r\nof Phrygia Epictetus and Bithynia, and is near to Constantinople. Eski\r\nSheïr, Sugut, and Biledjik are close to Brusa, Nicaea, and Nicomedia.\r\nOwing to the convenient waterways furnished by the Gulfs of Mudania and\r\nIsmidt, Brusa, Nicaea, and Nicomedia have always been within a day’s\r\nsail of Constantinople, even in the periods of primitive navigation.\r\nFrom the hills behind Eski Sheïr, Mount Olympus is the commanding\r\nlandmark of the western horizon. From Constantinople, Mount Olympus is\r\neasily distinguishable even in dull weather.\r\n\r\nIt was this country, adjacent to Constantinople, and separated from the\r\nrest of Asia Minor by rugged mountain ranges and the dreary, treeless\r\nplateau stretching eastward towards the Salt Desert, which gave birth to\r\nthe people who, a century after their appearance, were to inherit the\r\nByzantine Empire and to place their sovereigns upon the throne of the\r\nCaesars.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, Asia Minor, so long the\r\nbattleground between the Khalifs and the Byzantines, almost entirely\r\nabandoned by the latter for a brief time to the Seljuk emperors of Rum,\r\nwho had their seat at Konia, then again disturbed by the invasion of the\r\nCrusaders from the west and the Mongols from the east, was left to\r\nitself. The Byzantines, despite (or perhaps because of!) their\r\nre-establishment at Constantinople, were too weak to make any serious\r\nattempt to recover what they had lost to the Seljuk Turks. The Mongols\r\nof the horde of Djenghiz Khan had destroyed the independence of the\r\nSultanate of Konia, and had established their authority in that city.\r\nBut they made no real effort to bring under their dominion the districts\r\nnorth-west and west of Konia to which they had logically fallen heir.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the fourteenth century, we find two Christian\r\nkingdoms, Trebizond and Little Armenia, or Cilicia, at the north-eastern\r\nand south-eastern extremities of the peninsula. In the north-western\r\ncorner, the Byzantines retained Philadelphia, Brusa, Nicaea, Nicomedia,\r\nand the districts in which these cities were located--a narrow strip\r\nalong the Hellespont, the Sea of Marmora, and the Bosphorus. Asia Minor,\r\nwithout even a semblance of centralized authority, was to him who could\r\ngain and who could hold.\r\n\r\nHad there been in Asia Minor in the latter half of the thirteenth\r\ncentury a predominant element, with an historical past and with a strong\r\nleader, we might have seen a revival of the sultanate of Konia. Or we\r\nmight have seen a revival of Hellenism, a grafting, perhaps, on fresh\r\nstock, which would have put new foundations under the Byzantine Empire\r\nby a reconquest of the Asiatic themes. But the Mongols and the Crusaders\r\nhad done their work too well. The Latins at Constantinople, and the\r\nMongols in Persia and Mesopotamia, had removed any possibility of a\r\nrevival of either Arab Moslem or Greek Christian traditions.\r\n\r\nSixty years of Latin rule at Constantinople, and in the lower portion of\r\nthe Balkan peninsula, had demonstrated the futility of any further\r\neffort on the part of western Europe to inherit the Eastern Roman\r\nEmpire. The Mongols, the strongest cohesive military power at that time\r\nin the world, had not been won to Christianity, and thus inspired with a\r\ndesire to re-establish for themselves the succession of the Caesars in\r\nthe Levant.[1] The Italians, imbued with the city ideal which had been\r\nso fatal to the ancient Greeks, and divided into factions in their\r\ncities, were beginning a bitter struggle for commercial supremacy in the\r\nEast that was to lose its vital importance from the discoveries of Vasco\r\nda Gama, Columbus, and Magellan, and to render them impotent before the\r\nOsmanlis after centuries of misdirected energy and useless sacrifice.\r\nThe last great crusade had passed by Asia Minor to spend itself in a\r\nlosing fight against the one remaining Moslem power.\r\n\r\nAs in other critical periods of history, then, an entirely new people,\r\nwith an entirely new line of sovereigns, must work out its destiny in\r\nthis abandoned country, or--to state what actually did happen--must\r\ncome, with a strength and prestige gained in Europe, to subdue it and to\r\npossess it.\r\n\r\nFrom the eighth to the thirteenth centuries a number of new ethnic\r\nelements had entered Asia Minor. Except along the range of the Taurus\r\nand in the valleys of rivers which emptied into the Aegaean Sea, the\r\nGreek element, or more specifically, the Hellenic organization of\r\nimperial institutions, had gone back to the coast cities from which it\r\nhad originally come. The progress of Moslem conquest, after driving\r\nbefore it into Asia Minor the more zealous and militant Armenian and\r\nSyrian Christians, had brought a considerable immigration, partly\r\nSyrian, partly Arab, and varying in faith. The earlier Turks, who came\r\nlargely by way of Persia, with a period of settlement in that country,\r\nbelonged to the great Seljuk movement. They were nominally Moslems, and\r\nvery quickly became an indigenous element, because they had settled\r\nthemselves permanently in every place that had been opened up to Turkish\r\nimmigration by the Seljuk armies. So firmly rooted did they become that,\r\nwhen the fortunes of war allotted again temporarily some of the places\r\nwhich they inhabited to the Crusaders and to the Nicaean Byzantines,\r\nthey did not dream of moving out. This was the best country they had\r\never seen and they had no intention of leaving it. When the Osmanlis\r\ncaptured Brusa and Nicaea, they found many Moslems who had been there\r\nfor three generations. Simple-minded, tolerant of others, totally\r\nunconscious of the privileges as well as of the obligations of an\r\norganized society, the Turks of the earlier immigration neither opposed\r\nnor aided in the political changes which have so frequently been the lot\r\nof Asia Minor since their coming. This holds true of the Anatolian Turks\r\nof the present day, and will be so as long as they remain illiterate and\r\nuninstructed.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of the thirteenth century there was another great\r\nmigration towards Asia Minor, towards rather than into the peninsula,\r\nbecause it partly scattered itself in the mountains of Armenia and\r\npartly turned southward, going over the Taurus and Amanus ranges into\r\nCilicia and Syria. Some got as far as Egypt. The earlier Seljuk invasion\r\nhad been that of settlers following a victorious army. This invasion was\r\nthat of refugees fleeing before a terrible foe. For Djenghiz Khan and\r\nhis Mongol horde had come out of central Asia, and all who could, even\r\nthe bravest, fled before him. The lesson had been quickly learned that\r\nto resist him meant certain death. Because it was a migration of\r\nfamilies, with all their worldly possessions, and because they had to\r\nhurry and did not know where they were going, the great bulk of them did\r\nnot advance far.[2]\r\n\r\nMost of the bands, after settling for some years in the mountains of\r\nArmenia and in the upper valley of the Euphrates, were tempted by the\r\ndeath of Djenghiz Khan to return home. The steep mountains and narrow\r\nvalleys of Rum had dissuaded them from trying for better luck farther\r\nwest. It was too much up hill and down dale for their cattle.[3] The\r\nresolute and adventurous pushed on into Asia Minor, although in doing so\r\nthey must have lost or have left behind most of their women and children\r\nand flocks. For they were small warrior bands, bent upon enlisting in\r\nthe army of Alaeddin Kaï Kobad, the last illustrious sultan of the Konia\r\nSeljuk line--illustrious because he had not yet met the Mongols and was\r\nlooked upon by the fugitives as a possible saviour and avenger. Even if\r\nthey had not the intention of putting themselves under the protection of\r\nAlaeddin when they set their faces westward, they must needs have come\r\ninto contact with him. For of the two roads into Asia Minor from\r\nArmenia, the upper one lay through Sivas and Angora, and the lower\r\nthrough Caesarea, Akseraï, and Konia. Whichever route they took would\r\nlead them through the Seljuk dominions.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if Alaeddin viewed the appearance of these fighting\r\nbands with any other emotion than that of alarm. In spite of their\r\nundoubted skill as fighters, the Seljuk Sultan did not dare to enroll\r\nmany of them in his army. If he were defeated in battle, or if he should\r\ndie, he knew well that such vigorous mercenaries might upset his line.\r\nHe could rely upon their fidelity neither against the Kharesmians with\r\nwhom he was at that time fighting (many of them were from that Sultan’s\r\ncountry), nor against the Mongols with whom he must soon measure his\r\nstrength. So he followed the policy dictated by prudence. Resisting the\r\ntemptation of using them in his own army, he granted to their leaders as\r\nfiefs districts on the frontiers of his rapidly diminishing empire which\r\nwere hardly his own to give, where they would have to work out their own\r\nsalvation by mastering local anarchy in their respective ‘grants’, or,\r\nlike the Israelites of Canaan, fight for what had been allotted to them,\r\nagainst the Byzantine Emperors of Nicaea.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the tribe of destiny would be that which\r\noccupied the grant nearest Constantinople and the remnant of the\r\nByzantine Empire. The Turkish tribe which settled on the borders of\r\nBithynia, either by the direction and with the permission of Alaeddin\r\nKaï Kobad,[4] or independently of the Seljuks of Konia,[5] was that\r\nwhose first historic chief was Osman, the father of the Osmanlis.\r\n\r\nWith the other Turkish tribes, which succeeded in establishing\r\nindependent emirates, the Osmanlis did not come into contact until the\r\nreign of Orkhan. So it is unnecessary to trace their fortunes here.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere are no Ottoman sources to which the historian may go for the\r\norigin of the Ottoman people and royal house, or for their history\r\nduring the fourteenth century. They have no written records of the\r\nperiod before the capture of Constantinople.[7] Their earliest\r\nhistorians date from the end of the fifteenth century, and the two\r\nwriters to whom they give greatest weight wrote at the end of the\r\nsixteenth and the early part of the seventeenth century.[8] From the\r\npoint of view, then, of recording historical facts, one hesitates in our\r\nday to follow the example of von Hammer, by setting forth at length,\r\nafter a scientific collation, the legends which the simple-minded\r\nOsmanlis have always accepted without question. The Byzantines give us\r\nnothing worthy of credence about the origin of the Osmanlis, for the\r\nreason that they had no means of getting authoritative information. As\r\nfor the early European writers, their testimony is valuable only as a\r\nreflection of the idea which Christendom had of the Osmanlis when they\r\nwere becoming a menace to European civilization.[9]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, these legends are not to be ignored, as they have\r\nbeen by the latest authoritative writer on Ottoman history.[10] Where\r\nauthenticated facts are lacking, traditions must be examined and\r\ncarefully weighed. This is essential when we are considering the origins\r\nof a people. For no race has ever recorded its birth. The beginnings of\r\na people are so insignificant that they remain unnoticed in general\r\nhistory until the attention of others is attracted to them by their own\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nWho were the people that took upon themselves the name of Osman, their\r\nchief, and whom we must, from the moment of their very first encounters\r\nwith the Byzantines, clearly distinguish from the other groups of\r\nAnatolian Turks that had gathered around other leaders? Did they, at the\r\nbeginning of Osman’s career, have any distinct national consciousness?\r\nDid they have any past? Did they start the foundation of a state with a\r\ndefinite goal before them? Was there any other cause for their amazing\r\ngrowth and success than the mere fact that they had the most fortunate\r\ngeographical position, on the confines of a decaying empire?\r\n\r\nWith the purpose, then, of suggesting an answer to some of these\r\nquestions, and paving the way for an answer to the others later on, what\r\nthe Osmanlis accept concerning their origin and their history before\r\n1300 must be set forth and examined.[11]\r\n\r\nIn the year of the Hegira 616,[12] ‘because there was no more rest to be\r\nfound in all Persia’ for the Turks who had been forced out of the\r\nKhorassan[13] by the approach of Djenghiz Khan, ‘all the wandering\r\nTurks, fifty thousand families, followed their leader, Soleiman\r\nShah,[14] and set out for Rum. Then was Alaeddin I, son of Kaï Kosrew,\r\nthe builder of Konia, entered upon the rule of Rum. These fifty thousand\r\nnomad families journeyed several years in the neighbourhood of Erzerum\r\nand Erzindjian, changing from winter to summer quarters and plundering\r\nthe unbelievers who lived there. But ... finally ... Soleiman Shah\r\nmarched again towards his homeland, with the intention of passing\r\nthrough the district of Aleppo. As they came to the neighbourhood of\r\nDjaber, they wanted to venture across the Euphrates. Soleiman Shah drove\r\nhis horse into the river to seek a ford. The bank was rocky, so the\r\nhorse slipped and fell into the river with Soleiman Shah. His end was\r\nregarded as a warning (decision) of destiny: it appeared to be the\r\ncommand of God.... A part of these Turks remained to dwell there....\r\nThere was a division among the followers of Soleiman Shah. Some of them,\r\nwho now carry the name of Turcomans of Syria, went into the wilderness.\r\nOthers went towards Rum, and became ancestors of the nomad tribes who\r\nstill wander in Rum.\r\n\r\n‘Soleiman Shah at his death left four sons: Sonkur tigin, Gundogdu,\r\nErtogrul, the champion of the faith,[15] and Dundar. Some of the Turks\r\nfollowed these four brothers, turned themselves again in the direction\r\nof Rum, and came to the ... source of the Euphrates. While Ertogrul and\r\nDundar remained there with about four hundred nomad families, the two\r\nother brothers turned back again to their home.’ Ertogrul marched\r\nfarther into Rum, and settled near Angora at the foot of Karadjadagh.\r\nFrom there he wandered to Sultan Oejoenu.[16]\r\n\r\nNeshri now tells a story which is repeated by later Ottoman historians\r\nas a fact. Neshri says that he heard this story from a ‘trustworthy’\r\nman, who had heard it from the stirrup-holder of Orkhan, who, in turn,\r\nhad heard it from his father and his grandfather. This is worthy of\r\nmention, for it is one of the very few instances where an Oriental\r\nhistorian has taken the trouble to connect his facts with what might be\r\ntermed an original source:\r\n\r\n‘As Ertogrul, with about four hundred men, was marching into Rum, Sultan\r\nAlaeddin[17] was engaged in a fight with some of his enemies. As they\r\ncame near, they found that the Tartars were on the point of beating\r\nSultan Alaeddin. Now Ertogrul had several hundred excellent companions\r\nwith him. He spoke to them: “Friends, we come straight upon a battle. We\r\ncarry swords at our side. To flee like women and resume our journey is\r\nnot manly. We must help one of the two. Shall we aid those who are\r\nwinning or those who are losing?” Then they said unto him, “It will be\r\ndifficult to aid the losers. Our people are weak in number, and the\r\nvictors are strong!” Ertogrul replied, “This is not the speech of bold\r\nmen. The manly part is to aid the vanquished. The prophet says that he\r\nshall come to the helpless in time of need. Were man to make a thousand\r\npilgrimages, he finds not the reward that comes to him when at the right\r\nmoment he turns aside affliction from the helpless!” Thereupon Ertogrul\r\nand his followers immediately grasped their swords, and fell upon the\r\nTartars ... and drove them in flight. When the Sultan saw this he came\r\nto meet Ertogrul, who dismounted, and kissed the Sultan’s hand.\r\nWhereupon Alaeddin gave him a splendid robe of honour and many gifts for\r\nhis companions. Then gave he to the people of Ertogrul a country by name\r\nSugut for winter and the mountain range of Dumanij[18] for summer\r\nresidence. From this decides one rightly that the champion of the faith,\r\nOsman, was born at Sugut. Then was Karadja Hissar, like Biledjik, not\r\nyet captured, but was subject to Sultan Alaeddin. These were three\r\ndistricts.’\r\n\r\nSome time later, Ertogrul, acting as commander of the advance-guard of\r\nAlaeddin’s army, defeated a force of Greeks and their Tartar\r\nmercenaries, in a three days’ battle, and pursued them as far as the\r\nHellespont. Ertogrul’s force consisted of four hundred and forty-four\r\nhorsemen, which he commanded in person. After this battle Alaeddin\r\nbestowed upon Ertogrul as fief the district of Eski Sheïr, comprising\r\nSugut on the north, and Karadja Hissar on the south, of Eski Sheïr.\r\nKaradja Hissar was reported captured after an elaborate siege and\r\nassault by Ertogrul when he first came into the country. But it is again\r\nmentioned as one of the first conquests of Osman from the Christians\r\nafter his father’s death.[19] None of the Ottoman historians records any\r\nprogress of conquest during the long years of Ertogrul’s peaceable\r\nexistence. When he died, in 1288, Osman was thirty years old. He gave to\r\nhis son less than the Ottoman historians claim was his actual grant from\r\nAlaeddin I. If their own records of Osman’s conquests after 1289 are\r\ncorrect, we must believe that his tribe possessed only Sugut and a\r\nportion of the mountain range lying directly west. When Ertogrul died,\r\nthey had no other village--not even a small mountain castle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAfter Ertogrul’s death there was an amazing change. Osman and his\r\nvillagers began to attack their neighbours, extend their boundaries,\r\nand form a state. We cannot go on to a consideration of these events\r\nwithout mentioning some traditions of this period which furnish us with\r\na clue to the explanation of this sudden change of a very small pastoral\r\ntribe, leading a harmless sleepy existence in the valley of the Kara Su,\r\ninto a warlike, aggressive, fighting people.\r\n\r\nOsman once passed the night in the home of a pious Moslem. Before he\r\nwent to sleep his host entered the room, and placed on a shelf a book,\r\nof which Osman asked the title. ‘It is the Koran,’ he responded. ‘What\r\nis its object?’ again asked Osman. ‘The Koran’, his host explained, ‘is\r\nthe word of God, given to the world through his prophet Mohammed.’ Osman\r\ntook the book and began to read. He remained standing, and read all\r\nnight. Towards morning he fell asleep exhausted. An angel appeared to\r\nhim, and said, ‘Since thou hast read my eternal word with so great\r\nrespect, thy children and the children of thy children shall be honoured\r\nfrom generation to generation.’[20]\r\n\r\nIn Itburnu, a village not far from Eski Sheïr, and also not far from\r\nSugut, lived a Moslem cadi, who dispensed justice and legal advice to\r\nthose of his faith in that neighbourhood. He had a daughter, Malkhatun,\r\nwhose hand was demanded in marriage by Osman. But the sheik Edebali, for\r\na period of two years, persisted in refusing his consent to this\r\nunion.[21] Finally, Osman, when sleeping one night in the home of\r\nEdebali, had a dream.\r\n\r\nHe saw himself lying beside the sheik. A moon arose out of the breast\r\nof Edebali, and, when it had become full, descended and hid itself in\r\nhis breast. Then from his own loins there began to arise a tree which,\r\nas it grew, became greener and more beautiful, and covered with the\r\nshadow of its branches the whole world. Beneath the tree he saw four\r\nmountain ranges, the Caucasus, the Atlas, the Taurus, and the Balkans.\r\nFrom the roots of the tree issued forth the Tigris, the Euphrates, the\r\nNile, and the Danube, covered with vessels like the sea. The fields were\r\nfull of harvests, and the mountains were crowned with thick forests. In\r\nthe valleys everywhere were cities, whose golden domes were invariably\r\nsurmounted by a crescent, and from whose countless minarets sounded\r\nforth the call to prayer, that mingled itself with the chattering of\r\nbirds upon the branches of the tree. The leaves of the tree began to\r\nlengthen out into swordblades. Then came a wind that pointed the leaves\r\ntowards the city of Constantinople, which, ‘situated at the junction of\r\ntwo seas and of two continents, seemed like a diamond mounted between\r\ntwo sapphires and two emeralds, and appeared thus to form the precious\r\nstone of the ring of a vast dominion which embraced the entire world.’\r\nAs Osman was putting on the ring he awoke.[22]\r\n\r\nWhen this dream was told to Edebali, he interpreted it as a sign from\r\nGod that he should give his daughter to Osman in order that these\r\nwonderful things might be brought about for the glory of the true faith.\r\nSo the marriage was arranged.[23]\r\n\r\nThat Osman and his people were good Moslems themselves, and of Moslem\r\nancestry, is not questioned by the Ottoman and Byzantine writers, and\r\nseems to have been accepted as a matter of fact by the European\r\nhistorians who have written upon the history of the Ottoman Empire.[24]\r\nBut it seems very clear that Osman and his tribe, when they settled at\r\nSugut, must have been pagans. There is no direct mention, in any\r\nhistorical record, of the conversion to Islam of the tribes from the\r\nKhorassan and other transoxanian regions which, in the beginning of the\r\nthirteenth century, appeared on the confines of Asia Minor. The earlier\r\nTurkish invaders entered the country only after they had already for\r\ngenerations been in contact with Arabic Islam. Although they displayed\r\nno great knowledge of or zeal for their religion and were free from the\r\nfanaticism of the Saracens, the Seljuks were certainly Moslems.\r\n\r\nBut the Turks of the later immigration, from whom Osman sprang, had\r\nnever come to any great extent under the influence of Islam, even though\r\nthey had settled for some generations on the frontiers of Persia. If we\r\naccept the testimony of the Osmanlis themselves concerning their descent\r\nfrom Soleiman Shah, who had left Mahan with fifty thousand families, we\r\nhave a clear indication of their being non-Moslems from Neshri’s account\r\nof the dispersion of this horde after the death of Soleiman Shah. He\r\nsays that some were ancestors of the Syrian Turcomans and others of all\r\nthe wandering tribes in Rum--the habitual nomads of his own day. The\r\ntestimony of travellers from the twelfth century onwards is overwhelming\r\nin support of the pagan character of these tribes.[25]\r\n\r\nThe various Turkish tribes which entered Asia Minor at the same time as\r\nthat of Osman, and had penetrated into the western part of the\r\npeninsula, soon found themselves in a Moslem atmosphere. They were few\r\nin number. Nothing was more natural for them than to adopt the faith of\r\ntheir Seljuk kinsmen. This they did, for exactly the same reason that\r\nthe Bulgarians, although they had originally a tendency towards Islam,\r\nadopted Christianity.[26] It was so natural that it passed without\r\ncomment. These Turks were primarily warriors, indifferent to deep\r\nreligious feeling and conviction. So they could take on a new faith--if\r\nwe can say that they ever had a faith before--without any trouble or\r\nwithout any noise being made over it. Between 800 and 1000 the Seljuks\r\nchanged their religion three times.[27] At the sack of Mosul, in 1286,\r\nthe Turks and Turcomans made no distinction between Moslem and\r\nChristian, massacring the men and carrying off the women of both sects\r\nalike.[28]\r\n\r\nThe tractability of the Turks, as of the Tartars and Mongols, in the\r\nmatter of religion was noted by every traveller, and was so well known\r\nin western Europe that strenuous efforts were made by the popes at\r\nvarious times from Djenghiz Khan to Gazan Khan to bring these Asiatic\r\nhordes into the Christian fold. A united Christendom, even a united\r\nRome, might have seen its missionary work crowned with success.\r\n\r\nOf the village and castle chieftains with whom Osman at the beginning of\r\nhis career lived on friendly terms, almost every one was a Christian.\r\nHis lot was cast with them. He was cut off from the decaying Seljuk\r\ndominion of Konia. He had practically no intercourse with the other\r\nTurkish emirs of Asia Minor.[29] His only serious foes were the Mongols,\r\npagans like himself, who had, at the very year of his birth, given what\r\nseemed a death-blow to Islam in destroying the Khalifate at Bagdad in\r\n1258, and who were, when Osman began his active career, plotting with\r\nthe Franks of the Holy Land to aid them against the Egyptian\r\nsultanate--the last strong bulwark of Islam.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, the tremendous importance of these dreams of Osman, of his\r\nmeeting with Edebali, and of his marriage with Malkhatun. We cannot\r\nregard these events in any other light than as recording, in a truly\r\nOriental way, his conversion to Islam. The interpretation of the dream\r\nof the Holy Book strikes one immediately. Except in Seadeddin, the\r\nreligious significance of the moon and tree dream is overshadowed by the\r\nromance of Osman and Malkhatun. Let us give to sheik Edebali his proper\r\nplace in history as the great missionary of Islam, who found for his\r\nfaith in its hour of dire need a race of swordbearers worthy of the task\r\nof reconstituting the Khalifate and of spreading once more the name of\r\nMohammed in three continents.\r\n\r\nIt was the conversion of Osman and his tribe which gave birth to the\r\nOsmanli people, because it welded into one race the various elements\r\nliving in the north-western corner of Asia Minor. The new faith gave\r\nthem a _raison d’être_. This conversion, and not the disappearance of\r\nthe Seljuks of Konia,[30] is the explanation of the activity of Osman\r\nafter 1290, as in sharp contrast with the preceding fifty years[31] of\r\neasy, slothful existence at Sugut.\r\n\r\nErtogrul and Osman, village chieftain at Sugut, had lived the life of a\r\nsimple, pastoral folk, with no ambition beyond the horizon of their\r\nlittle village. No record exists of any battle fought, of any conquest\r\nmade. Turks had already made their appearance in raids against the coast\r\ncities of Asia Minor, upon the islands of the Aegaean Sea, and even in\r\nthe Balkan peninsula. But they were not the Turks of Osman. Until the\r\nstudents of the later Byzantine Empire, and of the Italian commercial\r\ncities in their relations with the Levant, make a clear distinction\r\nbetween Turk and Osmanli, there will always be confusion upon this\r\npoint. Ertogrul had about four hundred fighting men.[32] There is no\r\nreason to believe that Osman had more. His relations with his neighbours\r\nwere those of perfect amity.[33] There is no question of believer and\r\nunbeliever.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we find Osman attacking his neighbours and capturing their\r\ncastles. During the decade from 1290 to 1300 he extends his boundaries\r\nuntil he comes into contact with the Byzantines. His four hundred\r\nwarriors grow to four thousand. We begin to hear of a people called, not\r\nTurks, but Osmanlis, after a leader whose own name first appears at the\r\nsame time as that of his people.[34] They are foes of Greeks and Tartars\r\nalike. They are definitely allied to Islam. They possess a missionary\r\nspirit and a desire to proselytize such as one always finds in new\r\nconverts. Their unity among themselves, and their distinctively\r\ndifferent character from that of the other Turks of Asia Minor, becomes,\r\nduring the first sixty years of the fourteenth century, so marked that\r\nEurope is forced to recognize them as a nation. Being more in the\r\npresence of Europe than the other groups of Asia Minor, the Europeans\r\nbegin to call them simply Turks, and to take them as representing all\r\nthe Turks of Anatolia.\r\n\r\nBut they had never called themselves Turks until they got the habit of\r\ndoing so through the influence of European education upon their higher\r\nclasses, and because of the awakening since 1789 of the sentiment of\r\nnationality among the subject Christian races. Mouradjea d’Ohsson, who\r\nunderstood the Osmanlis better than any other European writer of his\r\nday, wrote in 1785: ‘The Osmanlis employ the term “Turk” in referring to\r\na coarse and brutal man. According to the Osmanlis, the word Turk\r\nbelongs only to the peoples of the Turkestan and to those vagabond\r\nhordes who lead a stagnant life in the deserts of the Khorassan. All the\r\npeoples submitted to the Empire are designated under the name\r\n“Osmanlis”, and they do not understand why they are called Turks by\r\nEuropeans. As they attach to this word the idea of the most marked\r\ninsult, no foreigner in the Empire ever allows himself to use it in\r\nspeaking to them.’[35]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nNor were the Osmanlis, until the reign of Bayezid, one hundred years\r\nlater, the strongest military and political factor in Asia Minor. The\r\nTurkish emirates of Sarukhan, of Kermian, and especially of Karaman,\r\ncould match the Osmanlis in extent of territory and ability to defend\r\nit.[36] We shall see later how the Osmanlis conquered their Anatolian\r\nneighbours by a prestige won in Europe and by soldiers gathered in\r\nEurope. One of the principal tasks of this book is to correct the\r\nfundamental misconception of the foundation of the Ottoman Empire, which\r\nhas persisted to this day.[37] It seems to be a pretty generally\r\naccepted idea that the Osmanlis were a Turkish Moslem race, who invaded\r\nAsia Minor, and, having established themselves there, pushed on into\r\nEurope and overthrew the Byzantine Empire. Nothing could be farther from\r\nthe truth. The Osmanlis were masters of the whole Balkan peninsula\r\nbefore they had subjugated Asia Minor as far as Konia!\r\n\r\nOsman and his people have no history until they come in contact with the\r\nByzantines. The Ottoman chroniclers, and the Byzantine and European\r\nhistorians who have followed them, give at some length the early\r\nconquests of Osman. But the accounts are fantastical, obscure, and\r\nfrequently contradictory. It is the story of a village chieftain, who\r\nsucceeded in imposing his authority upon his neighbours over an\r\nincreasingly wider area, until a small state was formed. But it is not\r\nthe same story as that of the other emirs who built up independent\r\nstates in the old Seljuk provinces. For Osman founded his principality\r\nin territory contiguous to Constantinople, and by attacking\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMIRATE OF OSMAN]\r\n\r\nand conquering the last fragments of the Byzantine possessions along and\r\nin the hinterland of the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmora. Osman’s\r\nopponents were all Christians. Had he attacked his Turkish neighbours\r\nfirst, had he gone south and east instead of north and west, in building\r\nup his state, there would never have been a new race born to change the\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to state with any degree of certitude the conquests of\r\nOsman before 1300. The record of village warfare, with its names of\r\nlocalities which even the most celebrated Ottoman geographer could not,\r\nthree centuries later, identify,[38] is of no importance whatever. The\r\nextent of Osman’s principality, when he and his people first appear in\r\nhistory, was very insignificant. In 1300 he had succeeded in submitting\r\nto his authority a part of ancient Phrygia Epictetus and Bithynia, whose\r\nfour corners were: south-east, Eski Sheïr; south-west, the eastern end\r\nof Mount Olympus; north-east, the junction of the Kara Su and the\r\nSangarius; north-west, Yeni Sheïr. In 1299 Osman took up his residence\r\nin Yeni Sheïr. This was the outpost of his principality, in a position\r\nof extreme importance, about half-way between Brusa and Nicaea.[39] In\r\nsixty years the tribe of Osman had advanced sixty miles from Eski Sheïr,\r\nthe old city, to Yeni Sheïr, the new city.[40] They held undisputed\r\nsway only in the valley of the Kara Su,[41] and their important villages\r\nand castles, Biledjik,[42] Itburnu, Inoenu, Sugut, AÏnegoel,[43] Karadja\r\nHissar,[44] Yundhissar, and Yar Hissar,[45] were all within a day’s\r\njourney of each other.\r\n\r\nIn 1301, twelve years after Osman began to form his state, he fought his\r\nfirst battle, and came into direct contact with the Byzantine Empire. At\r\nBaphaeon,[46] near Nicomedia, the heterarch Muzalon, with 2,000 men,\r\nattempted to check a raid the Osmanlis were making into the fertile\r\nvalley whose products contributed so greatly to the well-being of\r\nNicomedia. It was midsummer, just before the gathering of the\r\nharvests.[47] In a pitched battle, the unarmoured horsemen of Osman\r\ncharged so speedily and so impetuously that they broke through the heavy\r\nline of their opponents, and the Greek commander’s retreat was covered\r\nonly by the opportune arrival of Slavic mercenaries.[48] The Osmanlis\r\nwere too few in number to follow up this victory. It is hardly probable\r\nthat they made any attack on Nicomedia.[49] But they laid waste all the\r\ndistricts into which they dared to venture.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAt this same time the emirs whose possessions bordered on the Aegaean\r\nSea began to press hard upon the Greek coast cities and those few cities\r\nof the interior, such as Magnesia, Philadelphia, and Sardes, which still\r\nacknowledged the authority of Byzantium. In the spring of 1302, Michael\r\nIX Palaeologos came to Asia Minor to take command of the Slavic\r\nmercenaries. At first the Turks were in consternation, if we can believe\r\nPachymeres, but when they saw the unwillingness of Michael to fight,\r\nthey grew bold, and compelled the Emperor to take refuge in Magnesia.\r\nMichael’s unwillingness was not due to lack of courage, but because he\r\ncould not rely upon his Slavs. As true mercenaries, they were fighting\r\nfor pay, and there was no gold to give them. Michael’s father, the old\r\nEmperor Andronicus II, had not sent him any money. In Constantinople the\r\nVenetians were threatening to depose Andronicus; the almost annual\r\necclesiastical quarrels, which form so large and wearisome and\r\ndisastrous a place in the last century and a half of Byzantine history,\r\nwere embarrassing him; and the treasury was empty. Even if there had\r\nbeen money to send, it would have been a perilous undertaking, for the\r\nTurkish pirates were swarming in the Sea of Marmora, and had even seized\r\nthe Princes’ Islands, which are within sight of the Imperial City.\r\n\r\nWhen they saw that neither pay nor booty was forthcoming, and that they\r\nwere engaged in a hopeless struggle, the mercenaries forced Michael to\r\nallow them to return to Europe. This was the last genuine personal\r\neffort on the part of a successor of the Caesars to save the Asiatic\r\nthemes. It ended in ignominious failure. Not one battle had been fought.\r\nThe withdrawal of the Slavs was followed by an exodus of Greeks to the\r\nAegaean coast, and from there to Europe. Pachymeres claims that this\r\nexodus was general. But we cannot accept the testimony of Pachymeres as\r\naltogether trustworthy on this point. Many Greeks, for reasons which are\r\nset forth later, remained in the coast districts of Asia Minor, and they\r\ndid not leave, to any noticeable extent, the territory in which Osman\r\nwas operating. The Turks, however, made a raid into all the islands\r\nalong the Aegaean littoral, and crossed over into Thrace, where for two\r\nyears the fields could not be cultivated.[50]\r\n\r\nAt this critical moment, had there been any united action on the part of\r\nthe Turkish emirs, Constantinople would probably have fallen an easy\r\nprey to their armies and to their fleets. But each emir was acting for\r\nhimself, and was as much an enemy of his Turkish rivals as he was of the\r\nByzantine emperors. There is no instance in which any two of them joined\r\nforces, and acted together. Throughout the fourteenth century the armies\r\ndefending the Byzantine Empire contained almost as many Turks as those\r\nattacking it.\r\n\r\nTo the east and to the west Andronicus II, utterly unable to defend\r\nhimself, looked for aid. From this time on to the fall of Constantinople\r\nthe history of the Byzantine Empire becomes what the history of the\r\nOttoman Empire has been during the last hundred years. It is the story\r\nof an uninterrupted succession of bitter internal quarrels, of attacks\r\nby former vassals upon the immediate frontiers of its shrunken\r\nterritory, of subtle undermining by hostile colonies of foreigners whose\r\none thought was commercial gain, and of intermittent, and in almost all\r\ncases selfishly inspired, efforts of western Europe to put off the fatal\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIn the east, Andronicus expected much of Ghazan Khan. Were not the Turks\r\nof Asia Minor vassals of the Mongol overlord? Andronicus sent envoys to\r\nGhazan to offer him the hand of a young princess who passed at\r\nConstantinople as his natural daughter. Ghazan received them cordially,\r\naccepted the proffered marriage alliance, and promised to exercise a\r\npressure upon the Turks of western Asia Minor.[51] This promise,\r\nhowever, was not followed by any serious action. The Mongols were never\r\nmore than mere raiders in Asia Minor.[52] Before this marriage could be\r\nconsummated, Ghazan Khan died. The young princess was offered to and\r\naccepted by his successor. It was a useless sacrifice. For in this first\r\ndecade of the fourteenth century the long struggle between Christian and\r\nMoslem to win the Mongols ended, temporarily at least, in the conversion\r\nof the Khans to Islam.[53]\r\n\r\nFrom the west, Andronicus received aid of the most disastrous sort. When\r\nFerdinand of Aragon made peace with Charles d’Anjou, King of Sicily, in\r\n1302, he got rid of his troublesome mercenaries by sending them to serve\r\nthe Byzantine Empire. Roger de Flor, typical soldier of fortune, who\r\ncould not be matched in his generation for daring, insolence, rapacity,\r\ncruelty, and Achillean belief in his own invulnerability, arrived at\r\nConstantinople with eight thousand Catalans and Almogavares, the former\r\nheavy-armed plainsmen and mariners, the latter light-armed mountaineers\r\nof northern Spain. They were true prototypes of the soldiers of Alva and\r\nCortes. Roger was made Grand Duke, and married to Princess Marie, niece\r\nof Andronicus.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after their arrival, the Catalans became engaged in\r\nsuch bloody conflicts with the Genoese of Galata, and robbed and\r\nmurdered the Greeks with such alacrity, that Andronicus hastened to turn\r\nthem loose in Asia. Roger established himself in the peninsula of\r\nCyzicus. Here his Catalans fell immediately to plundering the\r\ninhabitants of the country, who soon found that they had passed from\r\nScylla to Charybdis, and carried heartrending tales of lust and greed\r\nand massacre to Constantinople.[54] The one Greek general who was doing\r\nanything noteworthy against the Turks was relieved of his spoils of war\r\nby Roger.\r\n\r\nIn 1305, by a swift march to the relief of Philadelphia, which was being\r\nbesieged by Alisur, prince of Karamania, Roger and his Catalans showed\r\nwhat they could do, if they would. The Turks were compelled to raise the\r\nsiege. Roger pursued them to the source of the Sangarius.[55] But, on\r\nthe way, the Catalans deprived their Greek allies of any portion of the\r\nrich spoils, and massacred the Slavic mercenaries who dared to argue\r\nwith them.[56] Gregoras says, probably with reason, that Roger could\r\nhave reconquered the whole of Asia Minor for the Byzantines.[57] But\r\nthat country seemed to attract him as little as it had attracted the\r\nMongols. He was no Crusader, glad and eager to undergo the terrible\r\nhardships which military operations among mountains and on arid plateaus\r\ndemanded. There was no motive to make the effort worth while. So he left\r\nthe Turks to themselves and went to Gallipoli, where he let it be known\r\nthat the Catalans were preparing an expedition to repeat the Fourth\r\nCrusade.\r\n\r\nIn fear for his life as well as for his throne, Andronicus sent an envoy\r\nto offer Roger the ‘government of the Orient’, general command of all\r\nthe troops in Asia, and twenty thousand pieces of gold. For full measure\r\nhe added enough wheat to nourish the Catalans for a year. The\r\n‘government of the Orient’ was as empty and meaningless a gift as the\r\nsupposed ‘grants’ of the Seljuk Sultan Alaeddin to the Turkish nomad\r\nchieftains. The only troops who could go into Asia and accomplish\r\nanything were already under Roger’s command. But the gold, which might\r\nhave worked a charm, was left behind, as the envoy was afraid to bring\r\nit. Roger scorned the emperor’s offer. Ten days later he repented, and\r\naccepted from Emperor Andronicus thirty thousand pieces of gold, one\r\nhundred thousand measures of wheat, and the title of Caesar. In return\r\nfor these princely gifts he had only to promise to lead three thousand\r\nmen against the Turks.\r\n\r\nBut a host of Spaniards, long before the discovery of America, were\r\nalready in search of ‘El Dorado’. They poured into Gallipoli on every\r\nmerchant ship from the West, and made the Byzantines begin to fear Roger\r\nmore than they feared the Turks. The remedy was getting to be worse than\r\nthe evil! Before leaving for his campaign, Roger rashly went to\r\nAdrianople to pay his respects to the young Emperor Michael IX, who was\r\nholding his court there. On the threshold of Michael’s bedchamber, like\r\nthe Duke of Guise at Blois, he was stabbed to death. A massacre of his\r\nattendants followed.\r\n\r\nA train of evils fell upon Macedonia and Thrace as a result of the\r\nassassination of Roger de Flor. Michael soon had reason to regret this\r\nill-advised deed. Not only did the Catalans, in their first access of\r\nfury, avenge the death of their great leader and their comrades by\r\nunspeakable cruelties and by the destruction of every village which they\r\ncame upon, not only did they defeat the young emperor in open battle and\r\nalmost capture him as he fled from the field, but they invited over from\r\nAsia Minor into Macedonia all the Turks who could be induced to come.\r\n\r\nAt Gallipoli the Catalans tried to form a state. It failed owing to\r\ndissensions among their leaders. Their raids into Thrace had so ruined\r\nthat country that they themselves began to starve. So they started upon\r\nan odyssey into Macedonia, where the common soldiers, wearied of the\r\ncivil strife engendered by their leaders, who were continually ordering\r\nthem to cut each other’s throats, decided to make an end of these costly\r\npersonal jealousies. They killed the nobles who led them, and marched\r\nsouth into Thessaly. Gauthier de la Brienne committed the imprudence of\r\nseeking their aid in Athens. In 1310 they killed Brienne, set up in\r\nAthens a military democracy, and started to revive the Peloponnesian\r\nWars.[58]\r\n\r\nThe further fortunes of the Grand Catalan Company do not come within the\r\nlimits of our work. Roger and the Catalans, for that matter, were never\r\nin direct contact with the Osmanlis. But it was necessary to give a\r\nbrief statement of their services to the Byzantine Empire in order that\r\nwe might have a proper appreciation of their services to the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. When they withdrew into Thessaly they had left the Turks behind\r\nthem in Thrace and Macedonia. To the unhappy emperor who had received\r\nthem nine years before as saviours of the Empire, this was their legacy.\r\n\r\nOwing to the adroit leadership of their chief, Halil, and to the\r\nimpotence of Michael, whose Slavic mercenaries had deserted him and\r\nwithdrawn into Bulgaria, these Turks were soon able to throw Macedonia\r\nand Thrace into so great anarchy that communication by land between\r\nSalonika and the capital was no longer safe.[59] And yet Halil had only\r\neighteen hundred men under his command! In 1311, shortly after the\r\nCatalans had left, Halil concluded with Andronicus and Michael an\r\nagreement by which he and his companions in arms were to have a\r\nsafe-conduct and free passage across the Hellespont. But the Greeks, in\r\nviolation of one of the most important points of this arrangement,\r\nattempted to take from the Turks their booty. Halil, instead of quitting\r\nEuropean soil, sent for reinforcements. The imperial army suffered a\r\ndecisive defeat, and Michael fled, having abandoned his personal\r\nbaggage. In insolent triumph, Halil adorned himself with the imperial\r\ninsignia.[60] All the region around the Hellespont and the Gulf of Saros\r\nremained for three years without cultivation. So desperate did the\r\nsituation become that Michael was compelled to seek aid of the Genoese\r\nand the Serbians. In 1314 the Turks of Halil were entrapped near\r\nGallipoli and massacred. But at what a price! The Serbians, whose\r\nco-operation had won the day for the Greeks, saw eastern Macedonia and\r\nthe open sea. They liked it. New troubles began to brew for the\r\nByzantines.\r\n\r\nThere were other long-standing troubles threatening from abroad. In the\r\nEast, the Mongols had overrun southern Russia, and were as great a\r\nnightmare to Andronicus as the Goths had formerly been to Valens. The\r\nrulers of Constantinople did not hesitate to purchase security on the\r\nBlack Sea by truces, which were sealed with the sacrifice of purple-born\r\nprincesses to pagan harems, and by humble protestations of friendship to\r\nkhans who treated the imperial ambassadors as the envoys of a\r\nvassal.[61]\r\n\r\nIn the West, another sword of Damocles was hanging over the emperors of\r\nByzantium. We must remember that the Greeks had been in possession of\r\ntheir capital again only since 1260, and that the heirs of the Frankish\r\nemperors still cherished the dream of a Latin re-establishment at\r\nConstantinople. In 1305, on the very day Clement V mounted the papal\r\nthrone, Philippe le Bel of France discussed with Charles de Valois the\r\nquestion of retaking Constantinople.[62] The following year Clement V\r\nexhorted the Venetians to co-operate in the conquest of the Byzantine\r\nEmpire.[63] Because they had grievances against Andronicus which had\r\nalready almost brought them to an open rupture,[64] the Venetians\r\nreadily lent ear to the Pope’s project. A treaty of alliance was\r\nconcluded between Venice and Charles de Valois, who had the powerful\r\nbacking of the King of France.[65] In 1307 Clement V wrote to Charles II\r\nof Naples urging him to reconquer Constantinople.[66] But the Pope’s\r\ninterest was soon diverted by the project of a crusade to support\r\nArmenia and Cyprus against the Egyptians.[67] Philippe le Bel turned his\r\nattention to the spoliation of the Knights Templars and to the important\r\necclesiastical questions arising out of the movement to rehabilitate the\r\nmemory of the unfortunate Boniface VIII.\r\n\r\nUntil the death of Philippe le Bel, in 1314, however, Andronicus and\r\nMichael always felt that there might at any moment be a repetition of\r\nthe Fourth Crusade. In seeking the reasons for the almost unhampered\r\nprogress of Osman against Nicomedia, Nicaea, and Brusa, it must not be\r\nforgotten that the Byzantine emperors did not have even the moral\r\nsupport of Christendom in their losing fight.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nDuring this first decade of the fourteenth century, the Byzantines had\r\nlost control of practically all the Aegaean Sea, and had to struggle\r\nfor a passage through the Sea of Marmora. After the recent Balkan War,\r\nthe Sublime Porte presented a memorandum to the Powers, in which it was\r\nstated that the possession of Rhodes, Lesbos, and Chios was absolutely\r\nessential to a maintenance of Ottoman power in Asia Minor. History, from\r\nthe time of the ancient Persian wars to the present day, confirms this\r\npoint of view. So, before taking up the progress of Osman’s conquests,\r\nit is important to note that during the years of Osman’s conflict with\r\nthe Byzantines Chios and Rhodes passed out of their hands.\r\n\r\nIn 1303 Roger de Flor had prepared the way for the Turks in Chios by\r\nsacking the island. What he did not destroy or carry off fell to the\r\nTurks when they raided the island the following year. ‘Andronicus saw\r\nthat he was no longer able to defend Chios against the Turks because of\r\nthe cowardice of his governors. The Turks already considered themselves\r\nmasters of Asia Minor and the majority of the islands.’[68] So he made\r\nBenedetto of Phocaea lord of Chios, and the island was lost to the\r\nByzantines. The Giustiniani family kept Chios until the Ottoman\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nThe emir of Menteshe invaded Rhodes about 1300.[69] But he did not\r\nsucceed in entirely conquering it. For ten years Greek and Turk\r\nstruggled for the mastery of this gateway to the Aegaean Sea. Then\r\nsuddenly an outside foe arrived and made the double conquest of\r\nChristian and Moslem alike. The Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, driven\r\nfrom the Holy Land by the Egyptian conquest, had tired of their refuge\r\nin Cyprus.[70] After vainly endeavouring to negotiate with\r\nConstantinople for the transfer of the proprietary rights of the island\r\nto their order, they attacked and conquered Rhodes with the\r\nencouragement of Philippe le Bel and the Pope. This great event, equally\r\ndisastrous to Turk and Greek, happened on August 15, 1310. For more than\r\ntwo centuries they were able to maintain at Rhodes a citadel and outpost\r\nof Christianity in a part of the world which was rapidly becoming _in\r\npartibus infidelium_.[71]\r\n\r\nThe emir of Menteshe made a strenuous effort to recapture Rhodes. The\r\nHospitallers, attacked before they had time to repair and strengthen the\r\nfortifications of the island, were saved only by the timely arrival and\r\nheroism of Amadeus of Savoy. This is said to be the origin of the arms\r\nof Savoy, which are perpetuated on the flag of modern Italy, and of the\r\nmotto of the sovereigns of Piedmont--F E R T, _Fortitudo Eius Rhodum\r\nTenuit_.[72] The historians of Rhodes, as well as the chroniclers of the\r\nHouse of Savoy, declare that Osman was the leader of the Turks who\r\nattacked Rhodes in 1310 or 1311,[73] and that he was instigated by the\r\nGenoese.[74]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nBut while Osman was, in the minds of these and other later historians,\r\nsupposed to be attacking Rhodes and making himself master of Asia\r\nMinor, he stayed within the narrow limits of his little principality,\r\nfrom which he never issued forth, as far as we know, during his\r\ncircumscribed career. For he had, within a day’s journey of his\r\nresidence, the imperial cities of Brusa and Nicaea, whose walls were far\r\ntoo strong for the infant Osmanlis. A little more to the north-west, in\r\na position of unrivalled strategic importance, defending the logical[75]\r\nwaterway to Constantinople from the valley of the Sangarius, lay\r\nNicomedia.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Kuyun Hissar (Baphaeon) we hear nothing of Osman\r\nuntil 1308. This year is memorable for several events of great\r\nimportance. The first of these is the capture of Ak Hissar, the fortress\r\nguarding the place where the Sangarius finishes its descent and enters\r\nthe plain behind Nicomedia. This was the last barrier opposing the\r\nprogress of the Osmanlis through the narrow peninsula which stretches\r\nout between the Gulf of Nicomedia and the Black Sea to form the extreme\r\nnorth-western corner of Asia. Owing to the terrible misfortunes which\r\nhad fallen upon the Byzantines through the Catalans, no effort seems to\r\nhave been made to use Nicomedia as a base of operations for defending\r\nthis peninsula. So before the year was out the Osmanlis appeared for the\r\nfirst time on the Bosphorus. In the years following the fall of Ak\r\nHissar the Osmanlis slowly but thoroughly extended their authority until\r\nthey were in possession of the harbours and fortresses of the Black Sea\r\nlittoral between the mouth of the Sangarius and the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Kalolimni, an island of the Marmora, which lies near\r\nthe mouth of the Gulf of Mudania, was occupied by Kara Ali.[76] By this\r\nthe water-route from Brusa to Constantinople, and one of the two routes\r\nfrom Nicaea to Constantinople, were obstructed.[77] Kalolimni has the\r\nhonour of being the first Ottoman island and the only one captured\r\nduring the chieftainship of Osman. The investment of Brusa from the land\r\nside now began. So alarmed was the commandant that he sent Osman a\r\n‘gift’ of money to purchase peace,[78] thus inaugurating the humiliating\r\nprecedent which the mightiest emperors and kings of Christendom came in\r\ntime to follow.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1308, also, that Osman captured Tricocca,[79] which cut off\r\nthe communication by land between Nicaea and Nicomedia. While he was\r\nengaged in dealing with Nicaea and Brusa, a danger threatened Osman from\r\nthe east. A horde of Tartars was hovering along the confines of his\r\nstate.[80] Some of them sacked Karadja Hissar at the time of the fair,\r\nand were prevented from marching on Eski Sheïr only by the timely\r\narrival of Orkhan, who defeated them through the superiority of his\r\ncavalry. Instead of massacring his prisoners, Orkhan, as was the\r\ninvariable custom of his father with the Greeks, offered the raiders\r\nIslam and Ottoman nationality.[81] It was in this way that the Osmanlis\r\nincreased in numbers.\r\n\r\nAfter 1308 the energies of the Osmanlis seem to have been directed\r\nagainst Nicaea and Brusa. The fall of Brusa is the only other event\r\nrecorded during the lifetime of Osman. Just when and how Brusa fell\r\ncannot be stated with precision. We shall find the same difficulty later\r\nin connexion with the fall of Nicaea and Nicomedia. The Turkish\r\ntraditions, as Seadeddin gathered them, state that Osman besieged Brusa\r\nwith a great army in 1317. He erected a fortress near Kaplidja, and put\r\nhis nephew, Ak Timur, in charge of it. A second fortress, either erected\r\nby Osman or captured by him, was put in care of Balaban, ‘his most\r\nfaithful follower.’ Kaplidja, now known as Tchekirdje, celebrated for\r\nits hot baths,[82] is on a ridge not more than a mile from the citadel\r\nof Brusa. It commands the approach from the port of Brusa, not far from\r\nwhere the road must cross the river. Traditional remains of the second\r\nfortress are still to be seen on a foothill of Mount Olympus, about two\r\nmiles south-east of the citadel.\r\n\r\nOf the actual fall of Brusa there is no definite statement in Seadeddin\r\nexcept that the city surrendered to Orkhan, who brought the news to his\r\ndying father. As Osman died in 1326, there is a gap of nine years to be\r\naccounted for between the investment of the city and its capture. To one\r\nwho has studied the contour of this country and the nearness of the two\r\nfortresses to the citadel of Brusa it is clear either that Brusa was\r\nsurrounded or fell very soon after the Osmanlis settled garrisons at the\r\ngates of the city, or that some _modus vivendi_ was arranged between the\r\nOsmanlis and the local garrison during those years. A decade has been\r\nthe conventional period for legendary sieges since Homer sang of Troy.\r\n\r\nFrom the Byzantine contemporary writers one gains the impression, which\r\nis probably a correct one, that Brusa was simply abandoned to the\r\nOsmanlis. There was no assault, and no bitter struggle outside the\r\nwalls of the city.[83] The Greek commander, discouraged by the apparent\r\ninability or unwillingness[84] of the emperors to come to his relief,\r\nsurrendered the city. Deeply disgusted, as he had every reason to be,\r\nEvrenos became a Moslem, and cast his fortunes with the Osmanlis. Many\r\nof the leading Greeks followed his example. For, while the people of\r\nBrusa through long years were straining every nerve to preserve their\r\ncity and to maintain the honour of Byzantium in Asia, the elder\r\nAndronicus and his grandson, Andronicus III, were engaged in trying to\r\ndestroy each other. It was a sordid civil strife with no redeeming\r\nfeature. Neither emperor had the slightest conception of patriotism or\r\nof personal honour or of the sacredness of family ties. From this time\r\nonward the Palaeologi put themselves on record as one of the most\r\niniquitous families that have ever disgraced the kingly office. When\r\nConstantine, one hundred and twenty-seven years later, fell with the\r\nwalls of his city, his death was a striking illustration of the wrath of\r\nGod upon the fourth generation of those who had hated and despised Him.\r\n\r\nIn the same year that Brusa fell, and with the same fate imminent for\r\nNicaea and Nicomedia, young Andronicus celebrated with great pomp his\r\nwedding. The Hippodrome, in sight of Mount Olympus, was the scene of a\r\ngay tournament in which young Andronicus distinguished himself by\r\nbreaking more lances than any of his courtiers. From his imperial\r\nthrone, the elder Andronicus looked on, and turned over in his head\r\nvarious schemes for making his grandson’s bride a widow. After the\r\nwedding festivities, while Andronicus was taking his bride to Demotika,\r\nhe was set upon by a band of roving Turks, at whose hands he and\r\nCantacuzenos both received wounds. When he reached Demotika, he learned\r\nthat his grandfather was preparing another war against him.[85] Is it\r\nany wonder that the Greeks of Asia Minor were not averse to becoming\r\nMoslems and helping in the founding of a new nation to inherit\r\nConstantinople? There is one more charge which must be recorded against\r\nthe elder Andronicus. When a crusade for the stemming of the Moslem\r\ninvasion was planned by Marino Sanudo, Andronicus not only refused to\r\nco-operate, but he would not even consent to interrupt his friendly\r\nrelations with the Sultan of Egypt.[86]\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nOsman spent his life in endeavouring to capture the three Byzantine\r\ncities which were all within a day’s journey of his birthplace. When we\r\nconsider how near he was at the very beginning of the struggle, and how\r\nweak and demoralized the Byzantines had become, we realize that we have\r\nto do with no impetuous invasion of an Asiatic race, sweeping before it\r\nand destroying an effete civilization. It is the birth of a new race\r\nthat we are recording--a race formed by the fusion of elements already\r\nexisting at the place of birth. The political unity of the Byzantine\r\nEmpire had been destroyed by enemies from without and from within. The\r\nsocial unity, which had been secured by the one bond of a common\r\nreligion that imposed upon the people its standards and dominated every\r\nphase of their life, was disappearing. For when the Eastern Church lost\r\nits spiritual life, it lost its hold on the Levantine Christians, who\r\nwere centuries ahead of the West in intellectual development. The time\r\nfor its reformation had come and passed without a Savonarola, a Luther,\r\nor a Calvin. Nor was there any Loyola to fight for the ancient faith.\r\nThe Church was unable to absorb the pagan invaders, as primitive Latin\r\nChristianity had done, by an irresistible moral superiority.[87] The\r\nappeal of Islam was greater than that of Christianity. Pagan and\r\nChristian alike, then, in their conversion to a new, fresh faith, joined\r\nin the formation of a new race. This is the story of Osman and of the\r\npeople who took his name.[88]\r\n\r\nThe legends which inevitably surround the founders of nations have\r\nburied the personality of Osman, and make an estimate of his character\r\ndifficult. We must reject entirely the appreciations of the Ottoman\r\nhistorians. None has yet arisen of his own people who has attempted to\r\nseparate the small measure of truth from the mass of fiction that\r\nobscures the real man in the founder of the Ottoman Empire. He is\r\nrepresented by the same writers as a powerful prince and as a simple\r\npeasant; as the master of Asia Minor and as the village chieftain\r\nfighting for very existence with his neighbours a few miles away; as\r\nreading the Koran and as illiterate; as the cruel and imperious murderer\r\nof his uncle Dundar for opposing a plan of campaign in his council of\r\nwar and as the merciful, clement conqueror; as the Moslem fanatic who\r\nordered the mutilation of dying infidels on the battlefield and as the\r\nwise ruler who dispensed justice to Moslem and Christian with no\r\ndistinction of creed; as depositing his treasures of gold and silver in\r\nthe castle of a neighbour and as leaving at his death only a robe, a\r\nsalt-cellar, a spoon, and a few sheep.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of contemporary evidence and of unconflicting tradition,\r\nwe must form our judgement of Osman wholly upon what he accomplished. He\r\ncertainly was not the son of a prince. He did not become in his day more\r\nthan the ruler of a very small domain. He did not compass within his\r\nlifetime the task at his very threshold--the subjection of the three\r\nimperial cities. It was certainly not by astounding successes on the\r\nbattlefield that he made people flock to him and form around him the\r\nnucleus of a state. And this state, although it did not come enough in\r\ncontact with the outside world to have money of its own,[89] grew\r\nsteadily year after year. The way his state was formed was the assurance\r\nof its permanence and of its great future. It is also an indication of\r\nthe real greatness of the man who formed it.\r\n\r\nOsman was founder of one of the greatest empires the world has ever\r\nknown, of a people unique in history through the blending of wild\r\nAsiatic blood with the oldest as well as the newest European stock, of a\r\nroyal family which claims the distinction of six hundred years of\r\nuninterrupted male succession. When we place these results over against\r\nthe limited field in which he worked, and acknowledge our lack of any\r\noutstanding deeds in Osman’s life by which these results can be\r\nexplained, we find ourselves in the presence of a combination of a\r\ncharacter and a cause which reminds us of William of Orange and England.\r\n\r\nOsman was a man of compelling personality, whom men loved to serve, even\r\nwhen their own ability matched or was superior to his. The families of\r\nthe Michaelogli and Marcozogli were founded by Christian companions of\r\nOsman, who became Moslem only after long association with him. Michael,\r\nMarco, and other leaders, including Osman’s own son, made for themselves\r\nmore distinguished military careers than Osman. But they always worked\r\nfor their leader. Their harmony and loyalty is in striking contrast to\r\nthat of the Byzantine and Catalan captains. Osman was great enough to\r\nuse masterful men. He never needed to assert his superiority, as\r\nmediocre men always love to do, by getting rid of possible rivals and\r\nsurrounding himself with lesser stars. He was able to hold himself, as\r\nwell as others, in check. He was patient and he was thorough. We know\r\nthe founder by his foundation.\r\n\r\nThen there was the cause. The giants of the forward march of Islam were\r\ndead. The tide had seemed to turn. Pagans ruled in Asia. Africa was\r\nasleep. In 1309 the Faithful in Spain were receiving their first serious\r\nreverse. Osman brought to his new religion the simple faith and the\r\nfresh enthusiasm of the neophyte. He was a reincarnation of his great\r\nnamesake and the other early Khalifs. The prayer which Seadeddin puts in\r\nOsman’s mouth illustrates his character:\r\n\r\n     O Lord, make upright my thoughts and just my designs.\r\n\r\n     Exalt the faith and the Religion, and destroy those who rise up\r\n     against it.\r\n\r\n     Scatter the hosts of the enemy, and bring to confusion evil men.\r\n\r\n     Make my sword the lantern of Thy holy faith, and the guiding torch\r\n     of my warriors.\r\n\r\n     Give unto me a glorious name, and victory against mine\r\n     adversaries.\r\n\r\n     Watch me with Thine eyes, and show me the way of Thy holy will.\r\n\r\n     Make me a true observer of the laws of Mohammed, and sustain me in\r\n     the shock of battle.\r\n\r\nOsman was a fanatic, if by fanatic is meant one who is stirred with\r\nreligious zeal and makes his religion the first and prime object in his\r\nlife. But he was not intolerant, nor were his immediate successors. Had\r\nhe started to persecute Christians, the Greek Church would have taken a\r\nnew lease of life, and Osman could not have gained the converts who made\r\npossible the Ottoman race.\r\n\r\nAttila, Djenghiz Khan, Timur, the greatest conquerors of the stock from\r\nwhich Osman came, utilized a race already made. They were leaders of a\r\nunited people. In spite of their dazzling exploits, they were mere\r\nraiders, and their empires were the territories of an unassimilated path\r\nof conquest. Osman’s work was more enduring than theirs, more\r\nfar-reaching in its results. For he was building in silence while they\r\nwere destroying with a blast of trumpets. We may place him with them,\r\nperhaps above them, for which of them gave his name to a people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nORKHAN\r\n\r\nA NEW NATION IS FORMED AND COMES INTO CONTACT WITH THE WESTERN WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe greatest inheritance that a father can leave to his son is\r\nuncompleted work, especially if the work present difficulties of a\r\nformidable character, which must be met and overcome immediately. No man\r\nis born great. No man has greatness thrust upon him. History recognizes\r\nonly the category of achievement. Facing an unfinished task is the best\r\nspur.\r\n\r\nOsman died at the moment of the surrender of Brusa. He left to Orkhan\r\nthe inheritance of Nicaea and Nicomedia unconquered; a state without\r\nlaws, coinage, and definite boundaries; a people just beginning to\r\nawaken to a national consciousness; and hostile neighbours far more\r\npowerful than himself.[90] Orkhan found himself without seaport, ships,\r\nor sailors. His fighting men were regarded among his Turkish rivals as\r\npoor material for an army.[91] Even the chieftainship of the Osmanlis\r\nhad not come to him by mere right of birth.[92] He had been chosen\r\nbecause of his ability to lead and to attract men. Now that Brusa had\r\nfallen into the hands of the Osmanlis, more was demanded in their emir\r\nthan personal charm and daring in battle. He must establish his right to\r\nthe chieftainship by making a viable state. This could be done only by\r\nthe addition of Nicaea and Nicomedia to his dominions, and by the\r\ntransformation of his followers into a nation.\r\n\r\nNowhere are the Ottoman historians more unsatisfactory than in their\r\naccounts of the reign of Orkhan. They fail to describe--much less to\r\nexplain--the evolution of their race during these thirty-five years from\r\na heterogeneous band of adventurers into a nation. Several of the\r\nOttoman historians write so admirably of later periods that we must\r\nattribute this failure as much to their lack of sources of information\r\nas to their inability to measure up to the demands of the modern mind\r\nwhich never asks how without adding why. The re-writing of history in\r\nthe twentieth century is not actuated by belief in superior ability. Our\r\nnew and wider point of view is gained from the advantage we have had in\r\nsecuring and comparing sources which were inaccessible to those who have\r\ngone before us. If, in this chapter, Byzantine sources are largely used,\r\nit is because we are writing the history of a people who built their\r\nnation directly upon the ruins of the Byzantine Empire, and because the\r\nByzantine sources are contemporary; while the earliest Ottoman\r\nhistorians wrote more than a century later than this period.[93]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Orkhan is divided into two parts by the events of the year\r\n1344. From 1326 to 1344 he was occupied in subduing the territory of\r\nwhich he had been tentative master at the death of Osman, in forming\r\nhis nation, and in organizing his army. From 1344 until his death in\r\n1360, his energies were bent chiefly upon getting a foothold in\r\nMacedonia and Thrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe first task which imposed itself upon Orkhan was the subjection of\r\nNicaea and Nicomedia. Just as the walls of Brusa had defied him to the\r\nend, those of Nicomedia and Nicaea were equally impregnable to the kind\r\nof army he could assemble. Whether it was that neither Byzantine nor\r\nTurk nor Slav nor Bulgarian were of the stock who would spend themselves\r\nscaling walls and battering down gates, or that the weapons of those\r\ndays were more favourable for the purpose of defence than of assault,\r\ncannot be determined. But the curious fact remains that during this\r\ncentury there are few instances of cities taken by storm. Captures were\r\neffected for the most part by capitulation or by treachery.\r\n\r\nComplete investment and consequent threatened starvation did not occur\r\nin the case of Brusa. Nor did Nicaea and Nicomedia surrender from\r\nstarvation. This is the place, rather than at the end of the last\r\nchapter, to give two of the long list of reasons for surrender which\r\nNeshri puts into the mouth of the commandant and the leading citizens of\r\nBrusa.[94] For they state equally plainly and convincingly the case of\r\nNicaea and Nicomedia.\r\n\r\nThe economic reason was that the inhabitants saw the Osmanlis settling\r\nthemselves in all the country round about the three cities, and\r\nundisturbed in their permanent occupation of these regions by any\r\naggressive movement from Constantinople. Nicomedia, although\r\nadvantageously located for commerce, was not a port of call on the great\r\ntrade route. It depended for its well-being upon an unrestricted\r\ncommunication with the interior. Brusa and Nicaea were manufacturing\r\ncities, whose prosperity was due to the use of raw materials produced in\r\nthe vicinity, and to the ability to market the manufactured products.\r\nWhile food was still procurable, trade and business languished. When the\r\nGreeks saw that the Osmanlis had come in their midst to remain, and were\r\nnot mere raiders like the Seljuk Turks, they realized that the\r\nalternative to submission was ruin.\r\n\r\nThe moral reason I have already touched upon in relation to Brusa. If\r\nthere had been any hope of relief from the intolerable economic\r\nconditions under which they were living, the Nicaeans and Nicomedians\r\nmight have resisted indefinitely, and maintained a gallant struggle for\r\nlove of God and country. Their successful resistance, continued through\r\nmany weary years, is a remarkable testimony to their religious zeal and\r\nto their patriotism. It was not until they felt themselves deserted by\r\ntheir brothers of blood and religion that they finally yielded. The\r\nOsmanlis did not prevail over them in battle. Their walls were not\r\nstormed. Their gates held fast. They were not starved out. They were\r\nabandoned by the Byzantines. So they became Osmanlis.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTo understand the how and why of the fall of these cities and of the\r\nmingling of victor and vanquished in one race, we must review the\r\nhistory of the Byzantines during the years immediately following the\r\ndeath of Osman.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Brusa did not cause any cessation in the suicidal strife\r\nbetween Andronicus and his grandson. After the brilliant marriage\r\nfestivities of which we have already spoken, young Andronicus took his\r\nbride to Demotika, where, in the summer of 1327, he planned to surprise\r\nand oust his grandfather.[95] He was not content to wait for the old\r\nman’s death. Nor was he deterred from reopening the civil war by the\r\nthought of the imminent danger of the Byzantine cities in Bithynia. Old\r\nAndronicus, informed of his grandson’s intention, forbade his entrance\r\nto the capital, and negotiated with the Serbians to attack him from the\r\nrear.[96] This was a deliberate invitation to the Serbians, who were\r\nrapidly becoming dangerous enemies of the Empire, to enter Byzantine\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of young Andronicus to be allowed to come to Constantinople\r\nto justify himself was answered by an imperial rescript ordering the\r\nPatriarch to ‘strike out the rebel’s name from public prayers’. The\r\nPatriarch refused.[97] More than that, His Holiness threatened to\r\nunfrock any priest who would obey the imperial command. Old Andronicus\r\nhad the Patriarch deposed by a packed synod of his creatures, and thrown\r\ninto prison.[98]\r\n\r\nWar broke out. After an unsuccessful attempt to surprise\r\nConstantinople,[99] young Andronicus besieged the army of his\r\ngrandfather and the Serbians in Serres. They did not care to risk a\r\nbattle, so he marched on Salonika, which he captured through the\r\nconnivance of its inhabitants.[100] Macedonia and Thrace, with the\r\nexception of two or three fortresses, fell into his hands without a\r\nstruggle.[101]\r\n\r\nStephen, Kral of Serbia, now turned a deaf ear to the old emperor’s\r\nreiterated appeals for further aid. In his desperation, old Andronicus\r\ncalled in the Bulgarians, to whom he would have betrayed\r\nConstantinople, had not young Andronicus appeared in time to anticipate\r\nthis culminating infamy of the older Palaeologos. A Venetian fleet,\r\nwhich was besieging the city, retired, because its commander did not\r\nwant to appear to take sides either for or against the younger emperor.\r\nFriends inside left a gate open. Young Andronicus entered and appeared\r\nsuddenly at the palace. The Patriarch was re-established. Old Andronicus\r\nwas deposed and imprisoned.[102]\r\n\r\nThe old man, after having become, as Gregoras charitably puts it, ‘blind\r\nthrough tears’,[103] retired to a monastery, and died there in great\r\npoverty.[104] Like many others of the Palaeologi, Andronicus II had no\r\nredeeming trait of character, no single good deed to his credit.\r\nStranger to every natural affection, he died as he had lived, hating his\r\nown flesh and blood, striving to ruin his country, mocking God by the\r\nvery monk’s garb that he wore.\r\n\r\nThe first care of young Andronicus, after ridding himself of his\r\ngrandfather and rival, was to march on Adrianople, where, according to\r\nCantacuzenos, he forced Michael Asan of Bulgaria to make peace by the\r\ndisplay of his ‘fine army’.[105] Either the Bulgarians were very weak at\r\nthis time, or the ‘fine army’ of Andronicus III melted away quickly. For\r\nin the spring of the following year, 1329, Andronicus had to ‘gather\r\nhastily’[106] an army, when for the first time he felt it his duty to go\r\nto the aid of beleaguered Nicaea. He crossed the Bosphorus, and joined\r\nthe battle with the Osmanlis at Pelecanon, now Maltepé, on the north\r\nshore of the gulf of Nicomedia, a few miles from Chalcedon, the modern\r\nHaïdar Pasha.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Pelecanon is passed over in silence by the Ottoman\r\nhistorians as too insignificant to mention. But it is of the utmost\r\nimportance in showing why the Nicaeans surrendered their city to Orkhan.\r\nCantacuzenos, who took part in this battle, gives a long story in which\r\nthe result of the battle he is compelled to record belies all that goes\r\nbefore it. The Byzantines, according to Cantacuzenos, were eminently\r\nsuccessful in repelling the attacks of the Osmanlis. On all sides the\r\nGreeks won, and killed hundreds of their opponents, while their own\r\nlosses were slight. After inflicting this defeat upon Orkhan, Andronicus\r\nproposed, at nightfall, that the army withdraw to Constantinople! Some\r\nof his ardent warriors continued, however, to engage the enemy.\r\nAndronicus, surprised with only a few followers around him, was wounded,\r\nand escaped capture only by a hasty retreat. He was carried in a litter\r\nto Scutari, where he did not wait for news of his army. A caïque\r\nconveyed him safely home. Thus the successors of the Caesars abandoned\r\nAsia for ever.\r\n\r\nOld Andronicus, in his hour of humiliation, did not hesitate to strike\r\none more blow against his country. Spies of his in the army spread the\r\nrumour that the young emperor was dead. The imperial troops fled. They\r\nabandoned all their baggage, and were massacred by the Osmanlis, who\r\nhunted them down in the hills from which the fugitives could see the\r\ndome of St. Sophia.[107]\r\n\r\nWhen we contrast the long story of the civil war between Andronicus and\r\nhis grandfather, the armies gathered, the money expended, the energy\r\ndisplayed with this one pitiful attempt to aid the three great cities\r\nof Bithynia, there is no need for further speculation as to why these\r\ncities fell into the hands of the Osmanlis. No wearers of the imperial\r\npurple had ever made a more dismal showing: old Andronicus plotting to\r\ndemoralize the army of his country by false rumours, and young\r\nAndronicus making such rumours possible by being the first to flee from\r\nthe field after receiving a slight wound. It is no wonder that\r\nCantacuzenos records that after this battle Nicaea fell into the hands\r\nof the Osmanlis.[108] It is altogether natural, too, that the\r\ninhabitants of Nicaea should refuse, as those of Brusa had done, to\r\nprofit by the terms of the capitulation, and leave for\r\nConstantinople.[109] Their trades, silk-weaving and pottery, were\r\ndependent upon local materials, which they could not get elsewhere.\r\nThere had been nothing to inspire in them that devotion to a faith which\r\nmade the Huguenots long afterwards leave all without hesitation after\r\nthe revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\r\n\r\nHadji Khalfa says that in the seventeenth century the walls of Nicaea\r\nwere entirely ruined.[110] The condition of these walls to-day (for they\r\nhave not been repaired in modern times) contradicts this statement. It\r\nhas been the claim of the Osmanlis that Nicaea was reduced by fighting.\r\nIf this were true the walls must have suffered. It is also the common\r\nbelief[111] that Nicaea, at the time of the Ottoman conquest, and for\r\nsome time after, was a prosperous city.[112] But Ibn Batutah, who\r\nvisited Nicaea within five or six years after its change of ownership,\r\nwrote that its walls were intact, that the sole entrance to the city was\r\nby a road built up like a bridge and so narrow that horsemen could not\r\npass on it, and that the walls were surrounded by a wide deep moat\r\nfilled with water. One had to reach the gate by a pont-levis, which was\r\nin working order and used at the time of his visit. The city itself was\r\nin ruins and occupied only by a small number of men in the service of\r\nOrkhan. He was told that Orkhan had besieged the city ten years, and\r\nOsman before him twenty years. As the famous traveller was an honoured\r\nguest in the palace of Orkhan, where Orkhan’s wife was living at the\r\ntime, and where the emir himself came for a few days during the forty\r\ndays which Ibn Batutah spent in Nicaea, his testimony is certainly\r\nworthy of credence.[113]\r\n\r\nThat Nicaea, while preserving its admirable fortifications, should have\r\ndecreased so rapidly in importance and population during the seventy\r\nyears between the return of the Byzantine emperors to Constantinople and\r\nthe Ottoman occupation, is explainable only by three suppositions: that\r\na majority of the inhabitants had died off, that they had emigrated, or\r\nthat they had gradually joined their fortunes with the people of Osman.\r\nWe find in Byzantine annals no record of a disastrous plague or of a\r\nlarge emigration of potters and porcelain workers and weavers to the\r\ncapital or elsewhere from Nicaea. There was little fighting. The\r\nOsmanlis had not yet learned to massacre. What are we to believe, then,\r\nconcerning the large population of this so recently flourishing city?\r\n\r\nIt is hardly a conjecture to affirm that the Nicaeans must have cast\r\ntheir fortunes with that steadily growing band whose firm conviction,\r\nforced upon them against their will and in violence to centuries-old\r\ntraditions and sentiments, was that the old structure of society could\r\nnot be repaired, and that there must be an entirely new building upon\r\nthe old foundation. This conviction did not come suddenly or to all at\r\nonce. It was a gradual dawning and awakening which caused the ranks of\r\nthe Osmanlis to become greater every year. Before the end of Orkhan’s\r\nreign the nucleus of Asiatic adventurers which had gathered around Osman\r\nin the little village of Sugut had grown to half a million. It could not\r\nhave been by natural increase. It could not have been by the flocking in\r\nof nomads from the East. Orkhan was cut off from contact with the\r\nAsiatic hinterland. His rivals of Karaman, Satalia, Aïdin, and Sarukhan\r\nwould have attracted adventurers from the outside before himself. Orkhan\r\nformed his nation out of the elements on the ground. These were mostly\r\nGreek. Nicaea is but an illustration of the way in which the new race\r\nwas born and the new nation formed.\r\n\r\nThis conviction that no good could come from Constantinople went farther\r\nthan a transference of allegiance from the Palaeologi to the family of\r\nOsman. Mohammed was substituted for Christ. What a momentous\r\nsignificance there is in the records of the Greek Orthodox Church that\r\nin 1339 and again in 1340 the Patriarch sent an impassioned appeal to\r\nthe Nicaeans that they should not abjure the Christian faith![114] At\r\nthat very moment when the ecclesiastics of Constantinople were espousing\r\nthe rival claims of unworthy aspirants to the imperial purple and were\r\nanathematizing each other in supporting trivial theological arguments,\r\nChristians were adopting the new Credo: ‘I believe in one God, and\r\nMohammed is his prophet!’ in the city of the Nicene Creed.\r\n\r\nWe may place the surrender of Nicomedia in 1337 or 1338.[115] This was\r\nthe last Byzantine possession in the Ottoman corner of Asia Minor. The\r\nfall of Aïdos and Semendria on the hills behind Scutari had opened the\r\nway to the Bosphorus. Yalova, renowned for its baths, and Hereké, where\r\nConstantine the Great died, gave the Osmanlis undisputed control of the\r\nentrance to the Gulf of Nicomedia and secure possession of the city\r\nwhere Diocletian had made a new capital for the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOrkhan had now accomplished the first part of the great task left\r\nunfinished by Osman. But, before he could proceed to the establishment\r\nof laws for his new state, it was necessary for him to consolidate and\r\nstrengthen his position in relation to his formidable neighbours.\r\nDangers threatened from the east and from the south. In 1327 Timurtash,\r\na son of Choban, who was Mongol governor of Rum, pushed his raids as far\r\nas the Mediterranean, which the Mongol arms had not hitherto reached. He\r\nfought in turn Greeks and Turks.[116] Fortunately for Orkhan, the emir\r\nof Kermian, whose capital was Kutayia, had appeared so unpromising to\r\nthe eyes of Timurtash that the Mongols had not come northward. But they\r\nwere an ever imminent source of danger to the emirs of Asia Minor, and\r\nto Orkhan among them, until 1335, when the death of Bahadur Khan, just\r\nthe year before the birth of Timur, caused the disintegration of the\r\nMongol power in western Asia.[117]\r\n\r\nThe Mongol menace had contributed to the undisturbed operations of\r\nOrkhan against the Byzantines. Immediately upon its removal he was\r\nthreatened by the other Turkish emirs. It was a critical moment for\r\nOrkhan, whose territories had not yet reached the proportions of a large\r\nstate, like those of Omar of Aïdin and Mohammed of Sarukhan. Singly they\r\nmight have crushed Orkhan. United they certainly would have done so. But\r\nhere again the Byzantines contributed to their own downfall.\r\n\r\nIn 1329, at Phocaea, Andronicus had conducted his first negotiations\r\nwith the emirs of Aïdin and Sarukhan.[118] This unsuccessful attempt to\r\nembroil the Anatolian emirs with each other was a pitiful confession of\r\nweakness on the part of Andronicus. It did no harm to Orkhan. But it\r\ncalled the attention of these emirs to the impotence of Andronicus, and\r\nled to a series of petty raids in Macedonia and Thrace. Emboldened by\r\nthe ease of initial successes, Mohammed of Sarukhan in 1333 led in\r\nperson an expedition of seventy-five ships against the Macedonian coast.\r\nAndronicus was too weak to oppose his landing.[119] In the same year\r\nTurkish pirates seized for a short time Rodosto, on the Sea of Marmora,\r\nonly a few hours’ sail from Constantinople.[120] The following year the\r\nemperor was compelled to put an army in the field to save Salonika from\r\nthe Turks.[121]\r\n\r\nThese attentions from his proposed allies did not prevent Andronicus\r\nfrom seeking aid in the same quarters in 1336 when he was besieging the\r\nGenoese of Phocaea. Mohammed sent twenty-four ships, numerous troops,\r\nand all the provisions necessary to sustain the imperial army. The net\r\ngain to Andronicus from this expedition was the empty acknowledgement\r\nfrom Cattaneo of Phocaea, who was not afraid of Andronicus but did not\r\nwant to be bothered by him and his Turkish allies, that he would hold as\r\na ‘fief of the empire’ what Andronicus, even with the help of the Turks,\r\ncould not take from him![122]\r\n\r\nThis momentary diversion of the attention and energies of his neighbours\r\nwas most propitious for Orkhan. Andronicus had rendered him good\r\nservice. It gave to Orkhan an opportunity of enlarging and rounding out\r\nhis dominions without incurring opposition that would not only have\r\nprevented him from carrying out his schemes but might also have\r\ndestroyed him. Orkhan had been waiting for this moment. In 1333, the\r\nTurcoman emir of Mysia had died. His younger son had taken refuge with\r\nOrkhan, and promised in return for aid in dispossessing his brother to\r\nsurrender to the Osmanlis Balikesri and three other border cities.\r\nOrkhan could not act immediately. He contented himself with advising the\r\nelder brother to divide his dominions with Tursun. Tursun went to\r\nnegotiate in person, and was killed by his brother. This was shortly\r\nbefore the expedition to Phocaea. Orkhan was now ready. He put in the\r\nfield an expedition, ostensibly to punish the assassination of his\r\nprotégé Tursun, and was so successful that he forced the emir of Karasi\r\nto give up Pergamos and go into exile in Brusa.[123] In another\r\nexpedition, which probably occurred in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EMIRATES OF OSMAN AND ORKHAN]\r\n\r\n1337 at the earliest,[124] Orkhan added Mikhalitsch, Ulubad, and\r\nKermasti to his dominions. He was now virtually master of Mysia.\r\n\r\nThis was the extent of Orkhan’s conquests in Asia Minor. It is necessary\r\nto emphasize this point, owing to the erroneous idea which has so long\r\nbeen accepted and which has found its way into many modern writers.[125]\r\nNo corroboration can be found for the statement of Cantacuzenos that\r\nSoleiman captured Angora from the Tartars in 1354.[126] Aside from this,\r\nneither Byzantines nor Osmanlis report any further conquests of Orkhan\r\nin Asia Minor. From the fact that there is a complete silence as to\r\ntheir fate, it is reasonable to suppose that the Osmanlis during the\r\nlast decade of Orkhan’s reign destroyed the independence of several\r\nlittle states of which Ibn Batutah and Shehabeddin report the existence\r\nbetween 1334 and 1349.[127] But these were all in a general sense either\r\nincluded in Mysia (Karasi) or in the territory which Orkhan is popularly\r\nsupposed to have inherited from Osman.[128]\r\n\r\nAfter the Mysian expedition and the fall of Nicomedia, Orkhan may be\r\nregarded as the acknowledged sovereign of a definite state. We have good\r\ncontemporary testimony to his character, his power and his reputation at\r\nthis period just before he became an active factor in deciding the\r\ndestinies of the Byzantine Empire.\r\n\r\nIbn Batutah calls him the ‘lord of Brusa, son of Osman the Little,\r\npowerful and rich among the Turcoman kings, in treasures, cities and\r\nsoldiers’. He never ceased making the tour of the hundred castles he\r\npossessed. In each of these he would pass several days to repair them\r\nand inspect their situation. It was common report that he never spent a\r\nwhole month in a city, not even in Brusa. He was all the time fighting\r\nand besieging the infidels. It was his indomitable energy which seems to\r\nhave impressed the traveller from Morocco. The absolute lack of\r\nslothful, indifferent acquiescence in the will of God of these\r\nlatter-day Turkish converts was naturally a source of continual surprise\r\nto this doctor of Islam, fresh from his observation of races who had\r\nbeen for hundreds of years in the faith of Mohammed.[129]\r\n\r\nShehabeddin is less complimentary. He says: ‘Orkhan has under his\r\ndomination fifty cities and a still larger number of castles. His army\r\nconsists of 40,000 horsemen, and an almost innumerable host of\r\nfoot-soldiers. But these troops are not warlike, and their number is\r\nmore formidable in appearance than in reality. This prince shows himself\r\nvery pacific in regard to his neighbours, and always ready to help his\r\nallies. However, he is engaged in continual wars and is always at odds\r\nwith many enemies. If he gains little from these struggles, it is\r\nbecause his soldiers do not serve him well, his subjects are not well\r\ndisposed towards him, and several of his neighbours live in open\r\nhostility to him. I am told that the Osmanlis are treacherous men, whose\r\nhearts know only hatred and whose heads are filled with base\r\nthoughts.’[130] In another place Shehabeddin records that Orkhan has in\r\nthe field 25,000 horsemen who are fighting daily the prince of\r\nConstantinople. ‘The Greek emperor is eager to buy the goodwill of\r\nOrkhan by paying him a monthly tribute.’ Orkhan sends expeditions into\r\nEurope, ‘where waves of blood flow’.[131]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe first Ottoman legislation, and the organization of the army, is\r\nattributed by tradition to Orkhan’s brother, Alaeddin, rather than to\r\nthe emir himself. The story goes that Alaeddin was a man of peace, and\r\ndid not engage in war.[132] He refused to accept the generous offer of\r\nOrkhan to share the states of Osman, when their father died. Not only\r\nwould he not accept a division of the chieftainship, but he also refused\r\nto share the personal possessions of Osman. Then Orkhan said, ‘Since you\r\nwill not rule, be my vizier, and bear the burdens of the organization of\r\nthe state.’ Thus was created the office of Grand Vizier, which has\r\nplayed so important a part in Ottoman history.[133]\r\n\r\nIn the various lists, which were compiled at a much later date, Alaeddin\r\nis given as the first Grand Vizier. That this office, in its accepted\r\nform, was created during the reign of Orkhan is altogether improbable.\r\nThe story of the affectionate relationship between Orkhan and Alaeddin,\r\nand the sharing of duties by them, is, like the story of Ertogrul’s\r\nreceiving the promise after reading the Koran, a reminiscence of\r\npatriarchal days. The dream with its promise harks back to Jacob and the\r\nladder.[134] The relation between Orkhan and Alaeddin reminds one too\r\nstrongly of Moses and Aaron to be accepted without reserve. One has only\r\nto turn to the twentieth Sura of the Koran to find the connexion and the\r\nsuggestion: ‘And Moses answered, Lord, give me a vizier of my family,\r\nAaron, my brother. Gird up my loins by him, and make him my colleague in\r\nthe business: that we may praise thee greatly, and remember thee often;\r\nfor thou regardest us.’[135]\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast between this idyllic story of Orkhan and Alaeddin, and\r\nthe killing of Yakub by Bayezid on the battlefield of Kossova fifty\r\nyears later!\r\n\r\nAlaeddin was also the first Osmanli to receive the title of pasha. He is\r\nalways spoken of as Alaeddin pasha. This same title was conferred on\r\nSoleiman, the eldest son of Orkhan. The oldest son of Murad proving a\r\ntraitor, and there being no other son mature enough, Murad transferred\r\nthe title to Kara Khalil. This word, which came from the Persian, was\r\nthus early deflected by the Ottoman sovereigns from its original\r\nsignificance, the title of the eldest son of the ruler.[136] It soon\r\ncame to be bestowed upon high military and civil dignitaries. Similarly,\r\nthe rank of vizier passed immediately out of the imperial family.\r\n\r\nThat Alaeddin could have accomplished the work attributed to him by the\r\nOttoman historians, the making of laws and the organization of the army,\r\nis impossible for three reasons. The time for this great work was too\r\nshort and not a propitious period: Alaeddin died seven years after his\r\nfather, in 1333,[137] before Orkhan was firmly established in his\r\nsovereignty; the statement is incompatible with what we know of the\r\ncharacter of Orkhan; finally, the organization of the state and of the\r\narmy must have been the result of a slow development through many years,\r\nand its perfection belongs to the middle or latter part of Orkhan’s\r\ncareer, years after Alaeddin pasha’s death.\r\n\r\nThe whole scheme of an Islamic state is theocratic. Its laws, its\r\ncustoms are founded directly upon the Koran and the interpretation of\r\nthe Koran by the early ‘fathers’ of Mohammedanism. There is no civil law\r\nas distinct from ecclesiastical law.[138] The judges and the lawyers\r\nbelong to the clergy. Orkhan’s problem was exceedingly difficult.\r\nWhether they were Turkish converts or Greek renegades, the Osmanlis were\r\nall on common ground in their entire ignorance of the art of building a\r\nMoslem state. It is idle to speculate upon the early legislation of the\r\nOsmanlis, for there are no records. But it is probable that the Osmanlis\r\ndid not at this early time make any attempt to establish a body of laws\r\nin conformity with the Koran. Where the _Sheri’at_ (the sacred law) was\r\nunderstood, and where it was applicable to local conditions, it was\r\nnaturally used. But, side by side with the sacred Moslem law, existed\r\nthe old Byzantine code. This was used by the Osmanlis until they were\r\nfirmly seated in Constantinople. Only then did they acquire a complete\r\nsystem of Moslem canon law. It is within the scope of a work covering a\r\nlater period than that included in this volume to point out the strong\r\nByzantine and moderate Turkish influences in the _Kanunnamé_ of Mohammed\r\nthe Conqueror.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nFor dealing with Ottoman subjects and with those who might be conquered\r\nin war, certain principles were, however, adopted by the Osmanlis in the\r\ntime of Orkhan. The foremost of these was complete religious toleration.\r\nThis made possible, to a large measure it explains, the development of\r\nthe Osmanlis into a powerful empire.\r\n\r\nThe propagation of Islam by the sword under the early Khalifs, the\r\nsudden and unparalleled spread of the new religion from the Arabian\r\ndesert to Syria, Egypt, North Africa, and Spain, until the hordes of the\r\ninvaders were stopped by Charles Martel at Tours, the terrible ravages\r\nof the Moslem corsairs in the Mediterranean--here were the sources of\r\nthe deep impression of fanaticism and cruelty that the rise of Islam and\r\nthe followers of Mohammed had made upon an equally fanatical and cruel\r\nEurope. That the recrudescence of the Islamic movement under the\r\nOsmanlis was represented in the same colours by the early European\r\nwriters is explicable when we consider their lack of unbiased\r\ninformation and their confusion of the Osmanlis with the Asiatic\r\nconquerors, such as Attila and the Huns, Djenghiz Khan and the Mongols,\r\nTimur and the Tartars. We must take into account, too, the fact that\r\nthese historians wrote at a time when the Osmanlis were beginning to be\r\nperverted by fanatical Arab influences, and were a real menace to the\r\npeace of Europe. From the fifteenth to the seventeenth century, ‘the\r\nTurk’ was a monster of iniquity and cruelty, from whom even the distant\r\nEnglish in the security of their island home prayed to be\r\ndelivered.[139] The recent history of the Ottoman Empire has\r\nunfortunately contributed much to keep alive this impression.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the accumulated evidence which on the surface points to a\r\ncontrary conclusion, the Osmanli is not and never has been a religious\r\nfanatic like the Arab Moslem.[140] He is not by nature zealous or\r\nenthusiastic, nor is he by nature cruel. Docile, tractable, gentle, in a\r\nword, lovable--this is the verdict of the traveller who has had an\r\nopportunity of knowing that portion of the Moslem population of the\r\nOttoman Empire which is popularly called Turkish. Other influences of\r\ntheir religion than hatred for the Christian have prevented the Osmanlis\r\nfrom winning and keeping a place among the civilized peoples of the\r\nworld. Whatever one may claim in abstract theory for the Koran and the\r\nwhole body of Moslem teaching, its practical concrete results have been\r\nignorance, stagnation, immorality, subserviency of womanhood,\r\nindifference, paralysis of the will, absence of incentive to altruism.\r\nThese are the causes of the irremediable decay of every Mohammedan\r\nempire, of every Mohammedan people.\r\n\r\nThe government and the ruling classes of the Ottoman Empire are\r\nnegatively rather than positively evil. There is nothing inherently bad\r\nabout the Osmanli. He is inert, and has thus failed to reach the\r\nstandards set by the progress of civilization. He lacks ideals, and has\r\nthus shocked the enlightened conscience of the modern world. By the law\r\nof the survival of the fittest, he has been cast aside.\r\n\r\nBut when we compare the early Osmanlis with the Byzantines and with the\r\nother elements in the Balkan peninsula, it is the Osmanlis who must be\r\npronounced the fittest. They were fresh, enthusiastic, uncontaminated,\r\nenergetic. They had ideals: they had a goal. As it is with the\r\nindividual, so it is with the nation. Ideals are lost when the goal is\r\nreached. Decay sets in when the struggle for existence ceases.\r\n\r\nPressed on the one side by his Turkish neighbours and on the other by\r\nthe danger of including in his dominions a large and unassimilated mass\r\nof Christians, Orkhan was wise enough to desist from any attempt at\r\nforcible conversion. But some _modus vivendi_ had to be arranged. A mere\r\nraider would have massacred and destroyed, and the empire he built\r\nwould not have outlived the century of its birth. Orkhan was neither\r\nraider nor invader. He lived in the country of his father and of his\r\ngrandfather. Many of his lieutenants--certainly his ablest\r\nones[141]--were descendants of the oldest stock in Asia Minor. His\r\nnation, if it was to be a nation, depended upon at least a partial\r\nassimilation of the Byzantines. As his dominions increased, it became\r\nclear that there had to be some distinction between Moslem and Christian\r\nother than a profession of faith. He must devise some reward, which\r\nwould be so attractive that the Christians, especially the higher\r\nclasses among them, would change their faith in order to secure its\r\nbenefits. This was the problem.\r\n\r\nOrkhan solved this problem by establishing a system of rewards for\r\nmilitary service, and then by restricting military service to Moslems.\r\nHe divided the land he had conquered among his faithful warriors, and\r\nlet it be known that in future conquests a large portion of the\r\nterritory won, outside of the cities, would be bestowed upon soldiers\r\nwho took part in his campaigns. These lands were to be held as military\r\nfiefs. The only obligation was that of military service, which could be\r\nperformed either by actually putting into the field a number of men in\r\nproportion to the land held or by paying a sum sufficient to replace the\r\nquota by hired troops. So far this was but an adaptation of the European\r\nfeudal system. But it was superior to the European system in that the\r\nholdings were small and that there was through two centuries an\r\never-present opportunity of winning new holdings.\r\n\r\nExcept in Albania and Bosnia, where the old nobility were to preserve\r\ntheir lands by conversion to Islam, there were no local traditions to\r\nprevent such a scheme by necessitating the dispossession of former great\r\nlandowners. The Seljuks, the Crusaders, and the Mongols in Asia Minor,\r\nthe Catalans, the Bulgarians, the Serbians and the civil wars between\r\nthe emperors in Macedonia and Thrace, the hangers-on of the Fourth\r\nCrusade in Thessaly, Greece, and the Aegaean Islands, had made so clean\r\na sweep of the old aristocracy, attached to the soil, that Orkhan’s idea\r\nwas feasible. Through these small holdings and through the rapid\r\nincrease of conquered territory, the Ottoman sultans were able, almost\r\nfrom the beginning, to exercise an absolute sovereignty over their\r\nexpanding dominions, and to prevent the rise of a class of nobles. The\r\nOttoman Empire has never known an hereditary nobility. In the later\r\nconquests, the Sublime Porte sometimes granted life rights of\r\ngovernorship, with a tacit understanding that the succession should go\r\nto the son, to local chieftains or to large landowners. But these\r\nconcessions were in regions never fully conquered, and remote from\r\nConstantinople. Those to whom these privileges were given had no part in\r\nthe central government and no rank outside of their immediate locality.\r\n\r\nIn place of military service, every adult Christian paid a special\r\nhead-tax, to be used for the support of the army. The Christian was\r\nexempt from military service; the Mussulman was exempt from taxes.[142]\r\nThis head-tax was heavy, and so gauged as to keep the Christian, unless\r\nhe lived in a city, in economic dependence upon the Moslem landowner. As\r\na general rule, during the first century and a half of Ottoman conquest,\r\nthose who held to the old faith went to the cities and large towns. The\r\nMoslem thus became, without any attempt at forcible conversion or need\r\nto massacre, the undisputed possessor of the country districts.\r\n\r\nAside from the onerous head-tax, there were grave inequalities for the\r\nChristian in matters of law and in intermarriage. After the fall of\r\nConstantinople, Mohammed the Conqueror gave the Christians a large\r\nmeasure of self-government by putting them in _millets_ (nations) under\r\nthe headship of the ecclesiastical authorities. But the inequality in\r\nthe matter of intermarriage has never been done away with. A Moslem may\r\nmarry a Christian woman, but a Christian is forbidden to marry a\r\nMohammedan woman. In the earliest days, when there was neither racial\r\nnor religious antipathy and Christian and Moslem lived in close social\r\nintercourse, this law was a powerful proselytizing agency. It furnished\r\na temptation to a change of faith which, whenever it arose, was far\r\nstronger than the temptation of lands, of power, of economic\r\nindependence, or of civil equality.\r\n\r\nThe moment one professed Islam he became an Osmanli. Religion has always\r\nbeen the test of nationality in the Ottoman Empire.[143] The Osmanlis\r\nincreased from the thousands to the millions, in Macedonia, in Thrace,\r\nand in Asia Minor. Ancestry was quickly forgotten in the midst of\r\never-changing conditions and the founding of a new social order. It is\r\nstill a characteristic of the Osmanli that he has no surname. The most\r\nwidely-read English writer of the seventeenth century on the ‘Turks’\r\nemphasized the mixture of blood in the Osmanli, when he wrote: ‘At\r\npresent the blood of the Turks is so mixed with that of all sorts of\r\nLanguages and Nations, that none of them can derive his Lineage from\r\nthe ancient blood of the Saracens.’[144]\r\n\r\nA majority of the Byzantines whom Orkhan, Murad, and Bayezid conquered\r\nmust have become Osmanlis. Once the change of religion was made, the\r\ndevelopment of the new race was not difficult. There was much in common\r\nbetween the Turk of Asia Minor and the Byzantine. An Armenian\r\ncontemporary wrote of them as if they were alike.[145] The Greeks did\r\nnot take to heart the new régime,[146] for the fiscal evils of the\r\nByzantine system reconciled them in advance to a change. Nothing could\r\nbe worse than that which they had suffered.[147]\r\n\r\nOf course, the love of woman, the desire for adventure, hope of economic\r\nindependence through rewards of land and removal of onerous taxes,\r\ndisgust with the Byzantine administration and with the lack of support\r\nfrom their rulers and ecclesiastical authorities--these influences did\r\nnot cause the conversion of all the Christians. In the cities, where the\r\ninequality and the inconvenience of remaining true to the old faith was\r\nminimized, and where Christianity has always been able to make itself\r\nfelt and heard,[148] there was no great temptation to a change of\r\nreligion. After the Osmanlis became stronger, and entered into the\r\naggressive period of conquest, they resorted to other means to swell\r\ntheir numbers. The institution of the Janissaries, and the permission to\r\nenslave those whom they conquered, gave the Osmanlis more potent and\r\nimmediately pressing arguments.\r\n\r\nFrom the completion of the conquest of Bithynia by Orkhan, the Osmanlis\r\ncan be called a distinct race with a national consciousness and a desire\r\nfor expansion. They can be distinguished from the Turks of the emirates\r\nof Asia Minor and from the Byzantines. The Turk did not absorb the\r\nGreek, nor did the Greek absorb the Turk. Both had taken a new religion,\r\nand if the Turkish language was adopted, it was rather the customs and\r\nlaws of the Byzantines which prevailed until the influence of the Arabs,\r\nenhanced as it was with the prestige of centuries of Islam, gained the\r\nascendancy over Turkish and Byzantine tradition alike. But this did not\r\noccur until the Osmanlis invaded Syria, Egypt, and Mesopotamia at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the Greeks were not the only element added to\r\nthe Turkish stock. The adoption of the Turkish language by the Osmanlis\r\nwas due not only to the fact that from the beginning it was the military\r\nand governmental language, but to its being the simplest and most\r\nvigorous medium of communication for the different peoples who became\r\nOsmanlis.\r\n\r\nCalling the Osmanlis Turks, and regarding them as invaders upon the soil\r\nof Europe, is an historical error which has persisted so long that the\r\nOsmanlis themselves have fallen into it! They have always distinguished\r\nthemselves from the Turks. This is proved by their own use of that word\r\nto describe a people as different from themselves as were the Greeks.\r\nEvliya effendi spoke of the ‘harsh language of the Turks’, and said of\r\nTurbeli Koïlik, which was conquered by Osman in 1312, ‘Though its\r\ninhabitants are Turks, it is a sweet town.’[149] Hadji Khalfa regarded\r\nthe Turks as synonymous with the Tartars, and an altogether foreign\r\nrace.[150]\r\n\r\nWhether their tolerance was actuated by policy, by genuine kindly\r\nfeeling, or by indifference,[151] the fact cannot be gainsaid that the\r\nOsmanlis were the first nation in modern history to lay down the\r\nprinciple of religious freedom as the corner-stone in the building up of\r\ntheir nation. During the centuries that bear the stain of unremitting\r\npersecution of the Jew and the responsibility for official support of\r\nthe Inquisition, Christian and Moslem lived together in harmony under\r\nthe rule of the Osmanlis. This was generally, though not universally,\r\nthe case throughout the fourteenth century in the Turkish emirates of\r\nAsia Minor.[152]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe army of Osman consisted entirely of volunteer horsemen, who were\r\ncalled _akindjis_. They wore no specified uniform. But they were superb\r\nriders and moved together ‘like a wall’--an expression that has come\r\ndown to the present day in Ottoman military drills.[153] When Osman\r\nplanned a campaign, he sent criers into the villages to proclaim that\r\n‘whoever wanted to fight’ should be at a certain place on a certain day.\r\n\r\nOrkhan was the organizer of the Ottoman army. He and his successor\r\nMurad laid the foundations of a military power which was without rival\r\nfor two centuries. Although there is no ground for the claim of many\r\nhistorians that the Osmanlis were a hundred years ahead of Europe in\r\norganizing a standing army,[154] they were certainly pioneers in the\r\ncomplete organization of an army on a permanent war footing. Orkhan\r\nunderstood well the principle _qui se laisse payer se laisse commander_\r\nthirty years before Charles V of France.\r\n\r\nHis irregular infantry (_azabs_) were placed in the front when battle\r\nwas engaged.[155] It made little difference how many of these were\r\nkilled, or whether they made a good show. They served to draw the first\r\nfire of the enemy. When the enemy’s energy was exhausted or when he was\r\nled to pursue the fleeing azabs, thinking the victory his, he came upon\r\nthe second line, which consisted of paid, disciplined troops. These were\r\naccustomed to fighting together, were acquainted with their leaders’\r\ncommands and strategy, and had a tremendous advantage over the usual\r\nmercenaries of the period in that they served a cause to which their\r\nlives were devoted and a sovereign whose interests were identical with\r\ntheir own. Whether this were due to training begun in the days of\r\nadolescence, or to the knowledge that bravery would be rewarded not by\r\nbooty alone (always an uncertain quantity which the ordinary mercenary\r\ninvariably begins to think of securing before his fighting work is\r\nreally accomplished), but by promotion in the service and substantial\r\ngifts of land, the result was the same.\r\n\r\nThe corps of salaried soldiers were called Kapu-Kali Odjaks, and their\r\nservice was centred in the person of their sovereign. They were supposed\r\nto be continually ‘at the door of the Sultan’s tent’. The Sultan paid\r\nthem regularly and personally. They served him regularly and personally.\r\nWhen they went into the field with a commander other than the Sultan,\r\nthe commander was regarded, during the term of his commission, as in the\r\nplace of the Sultan.[156] There came to be seven of these _odjaks_: the\r\n_janissaries_, the _adjami-oghlular_ (novices), the _topjis_\r\n(field-artillerymen), the _djebedjis_ (smiths), the _toparabadjis_\r\n(artillery and munition drivers), the _khumbaradjis_\r\n(siege-artillerymen), and the _sakkas_ (water-carriers).[157] It is\r\nimpossible to state just when these distinctive corps arose, but they\r\nare the logical development of Orkhan’s _Eulufeli_, the year-in and\r\nyear-out soldiery who followed arms as a definite profession and enjoyed\r\na regular salary fixed by law.\r\n\r\nThe _akindjis_, cavalry scouts and yet more than that, served as an\r\nadvance-guard, and opened up the country to be conquered. The greatest\r\ndangers and the richest rewards fell to them. They were recruited from\r\namong the holders of military fiefs (_timarets_). Guides (tchaousches)\r\nand regular paid corps of cavalry (_spahis_) completed the organization.\r\n\r\nIt may be that Orkhan had learned a valuable lesson from his observation\r\nof the Catalans and of the early Turkish invaders in Europe. For he\r\narranged his organization in such a way that the army would depend\r\ndirectly upon him, and not upon subordinates who might be led to put\r\ntheir personal interests above those of their chief. With the exception\r\nof the _akindjis_, whose loyalty was secured by their fiefs, there were\r\nno irregular bands raised and led by adventurers. Unity was the first\r\nstriking characteristic of the Ottoman army.\r\n\r\nThe second characteristic was readiness. We have already seen how\r\nAndronicus III ‘gathered in haste’ the army which he tried to oppose to\r\nthe Osmanlis. Lack of time for preparation is the excuse for many a\r\nByzantine disaster. An early and competent traveller wrote that the\r\nOsmanlis knew beforehand just when the Christian armies were coming and\r\nwhere they could be met to the best advantage. For they were always on a\r\nwar footing, and their _tchaousches_ and spies knew how and where to\r\nlead. ‘They can start suddenly, and a hundred Christian soldiers would\r\nmake more noise than ten thousand Osmanlis. When the drum is sounded\r\nthey put themselves immediately in march, never breaking step, never\r\nstopping till the word is given. Lightly armed, in one night they travel\r\nas far as their Christian adversaries in three days.’[158]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThe fall of Brusa, Nicaea, and Nicomedia did not cause alarm in Europe.\r\nThe rise of the Osmanlis had scarcely been noticed, even by the\r\nByzantines! The Turkish pirates in the Aegaean, who had no connexion\r\nwhatever with the Osmanlis,[159] were becoming, however, a menace to the\r\ncommerce of the Venetians and Genoese and to the sovereignty of the\r\nremaining Latin princes of Achaia and of the islands. In one of Marino\r\nSanudo’s letters we find the following significant passage: ‘Marco\r\nGradenigo, writing to me from Negropont (Euboea) on September\r\neighteenth, 1328, declares that unless some remedy be found against the\r\nTurks, who have marvellously increased in numbers, Negropont and all\r\nthe islands of the Archipelago will be infallibly lost.’[160]\r\n\r\nIn 1327 Andronicus II wrote to Pope John XXII, calling his attention to\r\nthe Turks as a danger to Christendom, and appealing for aid.[161]\r\nNothing was done at this time. The Byzantines were schismatics, and\r\nFrance at least was more intent upon a recovery of the Holy Land than\r\nupon checking the advance of the Moslem corsairs.[162]\r\n\r\nAndronicus III, in 1333, followed the example of his grandfather by\r\nmaking another overture to John XXII. He did not scruple to dangle\r\nbefore the Pope the bait of a reunion of the Churches.[163] The same\r\nyear Venice urged Cyprus and Rhodes to join in a coalition against the\r\nTurks.[164] The only practical outcome of the efforts of the popes, the\r\nVenetian senate, and the Byzantine emperors to raise a crusade during\r\nthe reign of Orkhan was the capture of Smyrna, in October 1344. Omar\r\nbey, emir of Aïdin, had been caught napping.[165] Smyrna remained in\r\npossession of the Knights of Rhodes until it was taken by Timur in\r\n1403.[166]\r\n\r\nThe futile agitation in Europe against the reawakening of Islam did not\r\nin any way hurt Orkhan. On the contrary it helped him greatly. Just as\r\nthe petty conflict of Andronicus III with Phocaea in 1336 had diverted\r\nOrkhan’s powerful southern neighbours, this interference of the Pope,\r\nand the activity of Rhodes and Venice, contributed to the prosperity and\r\ngrowth of the Osmanlis by striking a blow at his most dangerous rivals,\r\nthe Emirs of Sarukhan, Aïdin, and Hamid. After 1340 Orkhan was ready to\r\nextend his dominion into Europe. He did not have long to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nOrkhan had one rival whose goal was similar to his own. Stephen Dushan,\r\nkral of Serbia, was openly aspiring to the imperial throne. Byzantium\r\nhad no more formidable enemy than this warrior king, who in twenty-five\r\nyears led thirteen campaigns against the Greeks.[167] The memory of his\r\nephemeral empire has been cherished by the Serbians to this day. In\r\ntheir folk-lore Stephen Dushan and his deeds are immortalized. The halo\r\nof romance still surrounds the man and his conquests. It is in vain that\r\nhistorical science has demonstrated the purely temporary character of\r\nStephen’s conquests. It is in vain that he has been divested of the\r\nglamour of the chronicles and songs, and pictured in conformity with\r\nfact. To the Serbian peasant he is Saint Stephen, the glorious Czar, who\r\nbrought the Serbian Empire to its zenith. All the cities in which this\r\nadventurer and raider set foot are claimed in the twentieth century as a\r\nlegitimate part of ‘Greater Serbia’. Men have engaged in a bloody war\r\nand have died for this fiction.[168]\r\n\r\nStephen Dushan demands our attention because he is the one man who could\r\nhave anticipated the Osmanlis in winning the inheritance of the Caesars.\r\nA statement of his career is necessary before we take up the narration\r\nof the events which led to the invasion of the Balkan peninsula by the\r\nOsmanlis.\r\n\r\nStephen came into prominence in 1330 during the war which his father,\r\nUrosh, made upon Bulgaria. Czar Michael had repudiated the Serbian\r\nprincess Anna in order to marry a sister of Andronicus III. The\r\nBulgarians were badly beaten. Stephen received for his brilliant part in\r\nthe campaign the province of Zenta. Although he was only twenty-three,\r\nhis ambition to rule was already awakened. Dissatisfied, he demanded a\r\nhalf of his father’s possessions. Urosh refused. Stephen marched against\r\nhim, dethroned him, and imprisoned him. According to some authorities,\r\nhe had Urosh killed.[169] Whether he actually ordered the assassination\r\nor not, he profited by the crime.\r\n\r\nDuring the first decade of his reign, Stephen gathered a majority of the\r\nSerbian-speaking peoples under his rule, pushed down to the Dalmatian\r\ncoast, and asserted Serbian supremacy over a large portion of the\r\nterritory which his race had hitherto contested with the Bulgarians. His\r\nappearance on the Adriatic led to a nominal alliance with Venice.[170]\r\nIn 1340 he began the invasion of lower Macedonia. When the valley of the\r\nVardar was conquered, he attacked Serres. This city fell into his\r\npossession. He now considered himself ready for the advance on\r\nConstantinople. Drunk with success, he crowned himself at Serres[171]\r\n‘King by the grace of God of Serbia, of Albania, and of the maritime\r\nregion, prince of the Bulgarian empire, and master of almost all the\r\nRoman empire’.[172] A few months later he changed the title to ‘emperor\r\nand autocrat of Serbia and Romania’.[173]\r\n\r\nThe relations between Stephen and Venice during the period between 1345\r\nand 1350 show how easily an alliance between the Serbians and the\r\nVenetians might have been concluded. It was a critical time for Orkhan.\r\nHad Stephen Dushan, with the help of the Venetians, attacked\r\nConstantinople before 1350, the Osmanlis would have lost their goal.\r\nAfter his coronation, the ‘Roman emperor’ sent an embassy to Venice to\r\nsecure the Senate’s aid for the definite purpose of acquiring\r\nConstantinople.[174] In 1347 the Senate, in response to a second\r\noverture, congratulated Stephen on having been crowned ‘emperor of\r\nConstantinople’, but regretted the impossibility of aiding him. There\r\nwas a truce between Venice and the Byzantine Empire, and they were at\r\nthat moment engaged in a war with Zara.[175] However, like typical\r\nmerchants, they consented to sell arms to Stephen.[176]\r\n\r\nIn January 1348 the Senate congratulated Stephen upon his exploits,[177]\r\nand later in the same year granted him three, then four, galleys.[178]\r\nThis seems to be the extent of the help rendered by Venice to Stephen\r\nDushan. The success of Stephen in subjugating Thessaly, and his progress\r\nfarther south until, in 1349, the Serbian flags waved on the mainland\r\nopposite the Venetian castle of Ptelion in Euboea, alarmed the\r\nVenetians. The Senate complained of the piracy of the Serbians in the\r\nAegaean, and tried to re-establish peace between Serbians and\r\nGreeks.[179] Stephen became more insistent and the Senate more\r\nreluctant. On April 13, 1350, the Senate considered several demands made\r\nupon them by an envoy of ‘Stephen Dushan, emperor of Serbia and Romania,\r\ndespot of Arta and count of Wallachia’. Among them were Venetian\r\ncitizenship for himself, his wife and his son, a conference with the\r\nDoge at Ragusa, and substantial aid for the attack upon Constantinople,\r\n‘when he shall have conquered the ten parts of Romania outside of\r\nConstantinople.’[180] The chart of citizenship was accorded. But he was\r\ninformed that the Doge never left Venice during his tenure of office,\r\nand that there was a treaty of friendship with the Byzantines which\r\nprevented Venice from joining in an attempt to capture the imperial\r\ncity.[181]\r\n\r\nConvinced that he could expect no substantial assistance from Venice,\r\nStephen planned to work the old trick of the Byzantine emperors. The\r\nSerbians were already excommunicated by the Greek Orthodox Church.\r\nStephen negotiated with the Pope for the return of the Serbians into the\r\nRoman fold.[182]\r\n\r\nWhen war arose between Venice and Genoa, Stephen sent envoys to Orkhan\r\nto propose a union of the Serbian and Ottoman armies for a campaign\r\nagainst Constantinople. The marriage of his daughter to Orkhan’s son\r\nwas to seal the alliance. Orkhan accepted this proposal. An embassy was\r\nimmediately sent to Stephen to arrange the details of the alliance. But\r\nCantacuzenos determined to prevent this change of Orkhan’s allegiance by\r\na most drastic measure. He did not fear the anger of Orkhan as greatly\r\nas he feared a union between Orkhan and Dushan. The Ottoman envoys were\r\nambushed. Some were killed. Those who escaped, together with the\r\npresents destined for Stephen, were taken to Demotika.[183]\r\n\r\nNeither Stephen nor Orkhan tried to reopen the negotiations. They\r\nrealized that their ambitions were too nearly identical to permit a\r\nharmonious agreement as to a division of the spoils. Macedonia was as\r\nhard to divide in the fourteenth century as it is in the twentieth.\r\nAfter 1351 Stephen watched to see what effect the war between Venice and\r\nGenoa was going to have upon his fortunes. He also intrigued, as Orkhan\r\nwas doing, in the civil war of the Byzantines. These were his Capuan\r\ndays. They were fatal to the fame of Stephen--outside of the Serbian\r\nfolk-lore! The first expedition of Orkhan’s son Soleiman, in 1353, so\r\nalarmed Stephen that he tried to become reconciled to the Orthodox\r\nChurch. He sent an embassy to Constantinople, but the patriarch refused\r\nhis blessing until Stephen had renounced the title of emperor and his\r\nconquests east of the Vardar.[184] Stephen could not do this. Nor could\r\nhe wait longer. If he did not strike quickly, the Osmanlis would be in\r\nhis path. He took what was now a gambler’s chance. With eighty thousand\r\nmen he started for Constantinople. Death claimed him on the second day\r\nof the march.[185] The Serbian Empire did not outlive its founder.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nThe public life of John Cantacuzenos was contemporary almost to the year\r\nwith that of Stephen Dushan. He was associated with Andronicus III in\r\nthe capacity of grand chancellor and confidential adviser throughout the\r\ndecade which saw the loss of Nicaea and Nicomedia. Shortly after he had\r\nsucceeded in deposing his grandfather, Andronicus III was taken with a\r\nviolent fever. His crime-stained mind could not rid itself of the idea\r\nthat he was going to die, even after he had become convalescent. He\r\nsolicited Cantacuzenos to assume the imperial purple. He wanted to\r\nabdicate and take monk’s orders. A drink from a miraculous spring gave\r\nhim a new grip on life.[186] For eleven years he lived on, in every\r\ncrisis irresolute, in every disaster unkingly, bending always before the\r\nstronger will of Cantacuzenos. In 1341, at the early age of forty-five,\r\nhis worthless life ended. His legacy to the Empress Anna and his child\r\nheir was the guardianship of his ‘friend and counsellor, John\r\nCantacuzenos’. The grand chancellor accepted the regency with\r\nalacrity.[187]\r\n\r\nThree months after the death of Andronicus III, Cantacuzenos crowned\r\nhimself emperor at Demotika. He put the imperial crown also upon the\r\nhead of his wife Irene, a Bulgarian princess. Neither in Constantinople\r\nnor in Adrianople were the pretensions of Cantacuzenos admitted. The\r\nwidow of Andronicus, Anna of Savoy, refused to acknowledge the usurper.\r\nIn Adrianople the inhabitants called in both Bulgarians and Turks to\r\ndefend them against Cantacuzenos.[188] The Bulgarian Czar took sides\r\nsecretly against his son-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe year 1342 saw the Byzantines engaged in another terrible civil war.\r\nThe self-appointed emperor did not hesitate to go to Pristina and offer\r\nto Stephen Dushan Macedonia as far as Serres in exchange for Serbian aid\r\nagainst the Palaeologi.[189]\r\n\r\nWhen the Serbian assistance proved unsatisfactory, Cantacuzenos called\r\nin the Turks of Aïdin. Omar, with 83 ships and 29,000 soldiers, came to\r\nhis aid, but, because of the severe cold, returned to Asia before\r\nanything could be accomplished.[190] He came back in the spring of 1343\r\nwith 290 vessels and helped Cantacuzenos to enter Salonika. In the fall\r\nof this year Cantacuzenos led his Turkish mercenaries into Thrace. Anna\r\nappealed in vain to Venice to exercise a pressure upon the Turks and\r\nSerbians, so that they would no longer support her rival.[191] In\r\ndesperation she gave Alexander of Bulgaria nine strongholds in the\r\nRhodope Mountains in exchange for a few thousand soldiers. She resorted\r\nalso to bribing the Turks in Cantacuzenos’s service, and made overtures\r\nto Orkhan.\r\n\r\nThe crusade of 1344 against the Turks of Aïdin, which resulted in the\r\ncapture of Smyrna, prevented Cantacuzenos from continuing to receive\r\nsubstantial aid from Omar, who died four years later in an attempt to\r\nwin back Smyrna.[192] Stephen Dushan, as we have already seen, was\r\nlaying claim to the Byzantine throne himself. Cantacuzenos could turn\r\nonly to the Osmanlis.\r\n\r\nIt was in January 1345 that Cantacuzenos made his infamous proposal to\r\nOrkhan. In exchange for six thousand soldiers he was to give his\r\ndaughter Theodora to the Ottoman emir.[193] Orkhan now turned a deaf ear\r\nto the appeals of Anna. This was a better offer. The Osmanlis crossed\r\ninto Europe. With their help Cantacuzenos got possession of all the\r\ncoast cities of the Black Sea except Sozopolis, besieged Constantinople,\r\nravaged the neighbourhood of the capital, and won Adrianople.[194]\r\n\r\nIt was only by threatening to change to the side of the Palaeologi that\r\nOrkhan secured the fulfilment of the bargain. In May 1346 Theodora\r\nbecame his bride.[195] A few days later, while Cantacuzenos was\r\nbesieging the capital with the soldiers for whom he had paid so dearly,\r\nthe beleaguered city was awakened by an ominous event. The eastern\r\nportion of the Church of St. Sophia had fallen.[196]\r\n\r\nThroughout the year 1346 Constantinople was invested by Cantacuzenos and\r\nhis mercenaries. The aristocratic party was almost openly championing\r\nthe cause of the usurper, while Anna relied upon the democratic party\r\nand the Genoese. As for the clergy, they and the bulk of the population\r\nwere more interested in the ecclesiastical trial of Barlaam for the\r\nBogomile heresy[197] than in the civil war. In February 1347, while the\r\nSynod was in the act of condemning Barlaam, and Anna was confined to her\r\nbed with a serious illness, partisans of Cantacuzenos left the Golden\r\nGate open. The ‘faithful friend and counsellor’ of Andronicus III\r\nentered without opposition. The garrison had been bribed, and prevented\r\nthe Genoese from coming to the rescue of the empress. She yielded only\r\nwhen the palace of the Blachernae was attacked.\r\n\r\nAnna agreed to recognize Cantacuzenos and Irene as co-rulers, and to a\r\nunion of the families by the betrothal of Helen, daughter of\r\nCantacuzenos, to the young John Palaeologos. John, who was fifteen,\r\nprotested against marrying the thirteen-year-old Helen. His mother\r\noverruled his objections. In May the marriage took place in the church\r\nof the Blachernae, as St. Sophia was still in ruins. This ceremony was\r\nfollowed by the coronation of the two emperors, John Cantacuzenos and\r\nJohn Palaeologos, and the three empresses, Anna, Irene, and Helen.[198]\r\nFive rulers for the remnant of the Byzantine Empire! At that very moment\r\nin France, the Marquis de Montferrat, heir to the Latin emperors of\r\nConstantinople, was planning with the Pope to drive out both\r\nCantacuzenos and Palaeologos.[199]\r\n\r\nOrkhan was well satisfied with this entering wedge. He was now\r\nson-in-law of one emperor and brother-in-law of the other. His wife\r\nTheodora was granddaughter of the Bulgarian Czar. He had open to him\r\nalso a marriage alliance with Stephen Dushan. The gods were first making\r\nmad.\r\n\r\nCantacuzenos was compelled immediately to seek aid again of Orkhan.\r\nWhile he had been expending his energies against Constantinople, Stephen\r\nDushan had made great strides in Macedonia. At Scutari, where Orkhan had\r\ncome to congratulate his father-in-law upon the happy issue of the\r\nstruggle for the imperial purple, Cantacuzenos asked for six thousand\r\nOsmanlis to dislodge the Serbians from the coast cities of Macedonia.\r\nOrkhan sent the soldiers willingly. He must, however, have given them\r\nsecret instructions, for after having taken immense booty they returned\r\nto Nicomedia without having captured for Cantacuzenos a single one of\r\nthe cities held by Stephen.[200]\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to believe that Cantacuzenos from this time onwards did\r\nnot realize the danger to which he had exposed the state and the noose\r\ninto which he had put his neck. The papal archives and the writings of\r\nCantacuzenos himself reveal the fact that as early as 1347 Cantacuzenos\r\nhad appealed to the Pope to unite the western princes in a crusade\r\nagainst the Osmanlis,[201] that these negotiations were renewed in\r\n1349[202] and 1350,[203] and that in 1353 a last definite appeal was\r\nmade to Clement by Cantacuzenos for relief against those whom he had\r\ninvited into Europe to fight his battles.[204]\r\n\r\nThe five years between 1348 and 1353 gave rise to three events which\r\nwere fatal to the Byzantine Empire. They made possible the permanent\r\nfoothold of the Osmanlis in Europe. A man’s own efforts and a man’s\r\nability are not the sole factors in his success. Work and genius avail\r\nnothing where opportunity is lacking. Circumstances over which he has no\r\ncontrol contribute largely to the making of a man. Orkhan, at this\r\nculminating stage of his career, when he was ready to lead his people\r\ninto the promised land, was aided by the ‘black death’, the war between\r\nVenice and Genoa, and the conflict between John Cantacuzenos and John\r\nPalaeologos.\r\n\r\nThe ‘black death’ was first heard of in the Euxine ports. It reached\r\nConstantinople in 1347, and spread to Europe the following year. In\r\nItaly it was universal, and lasted three years. From 15 to 20 per cent.\r\nof the total population died.[205] In the maritime cities that had been\r\nin close contact with the East, the duration of the epidemic was longer\r\nand the mortality higher. The moral and economic effect was great\r\nthroughout Europe. Men looked with horror upon this inexplicable malady,\r\nwhich struck down every fifth person. It gave no warning. There were few\r\nrecoveries. For years after the last case was recorded there was nervous\r\nfear of its return. Communications with the Levant had been partially\r\ncut off.[206] Full intercourse was not resumed until after Orkhan and\r\nthe Osmanlis were rooted in Macedonia and Thrace. Orkhan had no crusade\r\nto fear as long as there lingered in the minds of the European peoples\r\nthe memory of this scourge. The bravest and most adventurous were\r\nunwilling to fight the angel of death.\r\n\r\nPlagues continued to visit the coast cities of the Balkan peninsula and\r\nAsia Minor from time to time during the rest of the fourteenth and the\r\nfirst thirty years of the fifteenth century. Between 1348 and 1431, nine\r\ngreat plagues are recorded.[207] These dates coincide with the most\r\naggressive period of Ottoman conquest. As the city population was very\r\nlargely Greek and Christian, we cannot over-estimate the importance of\r\nthese epidemics. They were a valuable auxiliary in enabling the Osmanlis\r\nto advance and assimilate without formidable opposition.\r\n\r\nThe ‘black death’ had hardly run its course in Italy when the commercial\r\nrivalries of Genoa and Venice culminated in a bitter war, that lasted\r\nfor two years, with varying fortunes, until the battle of Lojera in 1353\r\nbroke the sea-power of Genoa. After five centuries of independence the\r\nGenoese were compelled to put themselves under the protection of Milan.\r\nThe hatred engendered by this struggle is revealed in the archives of\r\nthe two republics. They left unturned no stone to destroy each other.\r\nThe history of Venice and Genoa during the fourteenth century reads like\r\nthat of Sparta and Athens. The scene of the conflict is the same: the\r\nmotive, the spirit, and the result are identical. Venice gained no\r\nmaterial advantage from the war. She had long been alive to the menace\r\nof the Osmanlis.[208] She had been warned by Petrarch of the certain\r\ndanger which a war with Genoa would entail, whether its outcome were\r\nfavourable or unfavourable.[209]\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman and Byzantine historians are silent concerning the relations\r\nof the Osmanlis with the Genoese during this war. That the Genoese asked\r\nfor and received aid from Orkhan is certain. There had been a convention\r\nbeforehand between the Osmanlis and the Genoese of Pera.[210] Both\r\nagainst the Greeks and against the Venetians the assistance of Orkhan\r\nmust have been substantial.[211] It was remembered with gratitude forty\r\nyears later.[212]\r\n\r\nThe triumphal entry into Constantinople and the sanction of the Church\r\nupon his imperial office did not end the troubles of Cantacuzenos. The\r\nfirst to turn against him was his own son Matthew, who also wanted to be\r\nemperor. Cantacuzenos appeased him for a time by giving him a portion of\r\nThrace. Then the Genoese of Pera, dissatisfied with the lowering of the\r\ncustoms tariff to other nations, burned the Greek galleys and arsenals,\r\nand attacked Constantinople. Cantacuzenos had to leave a sick-bed at\r\nDemotika to hurry to save the city. The Greek fleet was destroyed by the\r\nGenoese. The army of Cantacuzenos failed in an attack upon Galata. Peace\r\nwas concluded only when the unhappy emperor agreed to sell more land on\r\nthe Golden Horn to the Genoese, and restore them in the customs tariffs\r\nto their former place as ‘most favoured nation’.[213]\r\n\r\nIn 1349 Cantacuzenos called again upon Orkhan to send soldiers to him in\r\nEurope. Twenty thousand Ottoman cavaliers, under the command of Matthew,\r\nmarched against Salonika, which was on the point of giving itself to\r\nStephen Dushan. Cantacuzenos, with the young emperor John, went by sea.\r\nOrkhan, as on the last occasion, secretly worked against his\r\nfather-in-law. After Cantacuzenos had already sailed, he recalled the\r\nhorsemen who were with Matthew. It was fortunate for Cantacuzenos that\r\nhe met at Amphipolis a Turkish fleet which was about to land a force of\r\nraiders to ravage the country, and persuaded the commander to join with\r\nhim in a demonstration against Salonika. Otherwise the expedition would\r\nhave been a fiasco. As it was, Salonika surrendered. The army of\r\nCantacuzenos ascended the Vardar as far as Uskub, which was\r\nreoccupied.[214]\r\n\r\nIt would be too wearisome to go into all the details of the civil war\r\nbetween Cantacuzenos and John Palaeologos. Involved in it are the\r\nintrigues of Stephen Dushan of Serbia and Alexander of Bulgaria, and\r\nthe attitude of Venice and Genoa. At first it seemed as if Cantacuzenos\r\nwould be crushed. The partisans of Palaeologos besieged Matthew in the\r\ncitadel of Adrianople. The Genoese of Galata, in spite of the strong\r\nVenetian fleet whose co-operation, however, with the Greeks was\r\nlukewarm,[215] compelled Cantacuzenos to cede Silivria and Heraclea,\r\nbesides increasing their Galata lands.[216] In the fall of 1352 the\r\nVenetians and Bulgarians declared openly for Palaeologos.[217]\r\n\r\nIn desperation Cantacuzenos fell back for the last time upon the\r\nOsmanlis. He robbed the churches of the capital to pay Orkhan for twenty\r\nthousand soldiers, and promised him a fortress in the Thracian\r\nChersonese.[218] With this help he recaptured Adrianople, and relieved\r\nMatthew, who was still holding the citadel. The Serbians were beaten by\r\nOrkhan’s eldest son, Soleiman, near Demotika. All of Thrace and most of\r\nMacedonia returned to the allegiance of Cantacuzenos.[219]\r\n\r\nIn 1353 Cantacuzenos seemed to have recovered all the lost ground, and\r\nto be at the height of his fortunes. John Palaeologos, abandoned by his\r\npartisans, was in exile at Tenedos. An attempt to win back\r\nConstantinople by intrigue failed. Cantacuzenos, now practically sole\r\nruler, felt that it was time to establish a new imperial line. He had\r\nMatthew proclaimed co-emperor.[220] In his prosperity he forgot about\r\nOrkhan, who had put him where he was, he forgot that he had invited the\r\nOsmanlis into Europe and had shown them the fertile valleys of Macedonia\r\nand Thrace, that their fighting men had passed along the military roads\r\nof the empire under the command of himself and his son, that he had\r\nmustered Ottoman armies under the walls of Salonika, of Adrianople, of\r\nDemotika, and even of Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman historians place the first invasion of European territory by\r\nthe Osmanlis in the year of the Hegira 758 (1356), and state that\r\nSoleiman crossed the Hellespont one moonlight night with three hundred\r\nwarriors, and seized the castle of Tzympe, between Gallipoli and the\r\nAegaean Sea end of the strait.[221] It is represented as a romantic\r\nadventure, prompted by a dream in which Soleiman saw the moonbeams make\r\na tempting path for him from Asia into Europe.[222] The earlier western\r\nhistorians give a variety of dates. Some ascribe the first crossing to\r\nMurad.[223] Several claim that the Osmanlis were transported by two\r\nsmall Genoese merchant ships, and that there were sixty thousand of\r\nthem! The Genoese received a ducat per head. All the calamities of the\r\n‘Turks’ were brought upon Europe by the avarice of the Genoese.[224]\r\n\r\nWe can reject these stories without hesitation, just as we can reject\r\nthe date which the Ottoman historians give.[225] The Osmanlis had been\r\nfighting in Europe since 1345. They had come over in large numbers on\r\ndifferent occasions. There is nothing mysterious or romantic about their\r\nfirst foothold in Europe. In 1352 Cantacuzenos had promised to Orkhan a\r\nfortress in the Thracian Chersonese. Tzympe may have been given to\r\nSoleiman, or it was taken by him when the promise of Cantacuzenos was\r\nnot fulfilled. He did not have to cross secretly from Asia. The Ottoman\r\nsoldiers were already at home in Europe, and Soleiman had been their\r\nleader in several expeditions.\r\n\r\nShortly after the occupation of Tzympe, one of those earthquakes which\r\noccur so often in the Thracian Chersonese destroyed a portion of the\r\nwalls of Gallipoli. This was Soleiman’s opportunity. He occupied the\r\ncity, repaired the breaches, and called over from Bithynia the first\r\ncolony of Osmanlis. Other colonies followed rapidly, as the soldiers of\r\nSoleiman took Malgara, Bulaïr (the key of the peninsula),[226] and the\r\nEuropean littoral of the Sea of Marmora as far as Rodosto. The\r\nadvance-guard of the Osmanlis appeared within a few miles of\r\nConstantinople; and ‘conducted themselves as masters’.[227] This\r\ncolonization was so quickly and easily effected that one is led to\r\nbelieve that these colonists were for the most part renegade Greeks\r\nreturning to their former homes.\r\n\r\nCantacuzenos now reaped the full harvest of his policy. The patriarch\r\nCallixtus refused to consecrate Matthew. He reproached Cantacuzenos for\r\nhaving delivered Christians into the hands of the infidels, and accused\r\nhim of having given to Orkhan the money sent by a Russian prince for the\r\nrestoration of St. Sophia.[228] Compelled to flee for his life to the\r\nGenoese in Galata, the patriarch decided to declare for Palaeologos.\r\nWhen Cantacuzenos chose a new patriarch, Philotheus, who consented as\r\nprice of office to consecrate Matthew, Callixtus excommunicated him.\r\nPhilotheus returned the compliment. Then Callixtus sailed for Tenedos to\r\njoin John Palaeologos.[229]\r\n\r\nCantacuzenos, feeling the precariousness of his position at\r\nConstantinople just at the moment when he thought he had triumphed over\r\nevery obstacle to his ambition, bitterly reproached Orkhan for not\r\nhaving kept faith with him. He offered to buy back Tzympe for ten\r\nthousand ducats, and asked Orkhan to order the Osmanlis to leave\r\nGallipoli. Orkhan accepted the ransom for Tzympe, knowing well that he\r\ncould reoccupy this fortress when he wanted to.[230] As for Gallipoli,\r\nhe declared that he could not give back what God had given him. Was it\r\nnot the will of God rather than force of arms that had opened the gates\r\nof Gallipoli to him? Cantacuzenos sought an interview with his\r\nson-in-law, for he thought that gold might induce the Osmanlis to\r\nwithdraw. A meeting was arranged in the Gulf of Nicomedia. When the\r\nemperor arrived at the rendezvous, a messenger from Orkhan reported that\r\nhis master was ill and could not come.[231] No way was left open for\r\nfurther negotiations. The rupture was complete.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to Constantinople, Cantacuzenos sent envoys to the\r\nSerbians and to the Bulgarians to urge a defensive alliance of the\r\nBalkan Christians. They answered, ‘Defend yourself as best you can.’ A\r\nsecond embassy met with the response from Czar Alexander: ‘Three years\r\nago I remonstrated with you for your unholy alliances with the Turks.\r\nNow that the storm has broken, let the Byzantines weather it. If the\r\nTurks come against us, we shall know how to defend ourselves.’[232]\r\n\r\nThe indignation of the Greeks against the man who had sacrificed them to\r\nhis inordinate ambition reached the breaking-point in November 1354. The\r\ninhabitants of Constantinople declared for John Palaeologos.\r\nCantacuzenos was forced to barricade himself in his palace. Protected by\r\nCatalans and other mercenaries, he tried to temporize. He offered to\r\nabdicate if Matthew were allowed to retain the title of emperor with the\r\ngovernorship of Adrianople and the Rhodope district. Encouraged by a\r\nlull in the storm of popular feeling, he had the audacity to make an\r\n‘appeal to patriotism’, as he himself put it. He urged the people to\r\nsupport him in an expedition to retake the provinces conquered by the\r\nSerbians and the Osmanlis. This exhibition of effrontery was greeted\r\nwith cries of scorn. Cantacuzenos was publicly accused of wishing to\r\ndeliver Constantinople to Orkhan. A second revolution forced his\r\nabdication. He became a monk. Irene took the veil.[233]\r\n\r\nJohn Palaeologos returned from exile, and restored Callixtus to the\r\npatriarchal throne. It took several years of fighting and negotiating to\r\ncompel Matthew’s abdication. Not until 1358 did John V become undisputed\r\nruler of the remnant of the empire in Macedonia and Thrace.[234] But the\r\nmischief was done. The Osmanlis had put their foot as settlers on\r\nEuropean soil.\r\n\r\nCantacuzenos lived for thirty years in the monastery of Mistra, near old\r\nSparta. It was long enough for him to see the irreparable injury that\r\nhis ambition had caused to his country, and to realize how he had\r\ndestroyed the people to rule over whom he had sacrificed every higher\r\nand nobler instinct. Cantacuzenos has had a fair trial before the bar of\r\nposterity. For many long years, far removed from the turmoil of the\r\nworld, were spent in the building up of his brief of justification. He\r\nleft a history of his life and times. So he pleads for himself. But even\r\nif we did not have the testimony of Gregoras, and of the archives of the\r\nItalian cities and of the Vatican, to supplement the story of\r\nCantacuzenos, he would stand condemned by his own record of facts.\r\n\r\nCantacuzenos had far more natural ability than Andronicus II and\r\nAndronicus III. During the long and arduous struggle to satisfy his\r\npersonal ambition, he showed himself a keen, courageous, resourceful\r\nleader. At the beginning of his career he was in a position of\r\ncommanding influence. His country was facing a crisis which would have\r\ncalled forth the best and noblest in one who loved his race, his\r\nreligion, and his fatherland. But John Cantacuzenos loved only himself.\r\nThe legacy of the widow and helpless child of the friend who had trusted\r\nand honoured him gave to Cantacuzenos the opportunity for developing\r\ntrue greatness in the fulfilment of that highest of missions--a sacred\r\ntrust. But Cantacuzenos saw only the opportunity for taking advantage of\r\na dead man’s faith.\r\n\r\nTo say that Cantacuzenos was the cause of the downfall of the Byzantine\r\nEmpire would be to ignore other forces working to the same end, and to\r\nput too great an emphasis upon the power of an individual human will to\r\nshape the destinies of the world. However, in the stage of world\r\nhistory, leaders of men are the personification of causes. We group\r\neverything around them. The character and acts of Cantacuzenos reveal\r\nthe fatal weakness in the Balkan peninsula of his day. The Ottoman\r\nconquest was possible because there was no consciousness of religious or\r\nracial commonweal. How could this larger devotion, this larger sense of\r\nduty and obligation, be expected in men who were not influenced, much\r\nless constrained, by ties of blood and personal friendship?\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nCantacuzenos ceased to be a factor in Byzantine affairs in 1355. But the\r\nGreeks could not rid themselves as easily of Orkhan. The Osmanlis had\r\ncome to stay.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to establish with any degree of certainty the conquests\r\nof Soleiman pasha in the hinterland of the Gulf of Saros and of the Sea\r\nof Marmora. But we know that he captured Demotika, and cut off\r\nConstantinople from Adrianople by occupying Tchorlu.[235] If these\r\nimportant places were retaken by the Byzantines after the premature\r\ndeath of Soleiman, it was only for a brief time. At the beginning of the\r\nreign of Murad the Osmanlis were firmly ensconced along the coasts of\r\nThrace, and had made some permanent progress into the interior.\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden and full awakening on the part of the Greeks to the\r\nknowledge that the Ottoman invasion of 1354 was an irreparable disaster.\r\nA year before Soleiman pasha settled his Moslem colonies in the Thracian\r\nChersonese, the inhabitants of Philadelphia had felt themselves so\r\ncompletely abandoned by their emperors that they had appealed directly\r\nto the Pope for aid, promising to return to the Roman communion.[236] At\r\nthe approach of the Osmanlis in Thrace, the country population had fled\r\nto Constantinople, abandoning everything. Those who had money to\r\nemigrate elsewhere did so immediately. They had no hope of a change in\r\nthe fortunes of their country.[237]\r\n\r\nThe annalists of the Byzantine Empire record no heroic, bitter\r\nresistance to the army of Soleiman pasha. There was no mayor of the\r\npalace, no Joan, to revive the confidence of the people in their rulers,\r\nor to replace the family that had proved its unfitness. The Greeks had\r\nfeared Cantacuzenos, and had attributed their hopeless condition to his\r\nalliance with the Osmanlis. But they could not have greater confidence\r\nin John Palaeologos. For he made no effort, not even in the smallest\r\nway, to demonstrate that he was different from his weak and disloyal\r\nforbears.\r\n\r\nThe Byzantines feared also the intrigues of the Genoese, who were as\r\npersistent in their efforts to undermine the integrity of the Byzantine\r\nEmpire, as are the foreigners to-day engaged in commerce in the Levant\r\nto weaken and destroy the authority of the Ottoman Empire.[238] The\r\nbanishment of Cantacuzenos could not save them from the Osmanlis.\r\nPalaeologos could not save them. They could not save themselves. The\r\nonly way which occurred to them of preventing the Ottoman conquest was\r\nto give themselves to some Christian power. There were actually plans on\r\nfoot to offer the remnant of the empire to Venice, to Hungary, even to\r\nSerbia![239]\r\n\r\nIn France, during the fourteenth century, the Turks were not regarded as\r\na permanent factor in the Near East. Western Asia Minor was not called\r\n‘Turquie’ or ‘Turquemanie’, but ‘the land which the Turks hold’.[240]\r\nThere was no such illusion among the Italians. They accustomed\r\nthemselves very rapidly to the idea that the Osmanlis, if not the\r\nTurkish tribes, were in Asia Minor and the Aegaean to stay.\r\n\r\nThe immigration across the Hellespont in 1354 was not looked upon by\r\nthose who were acquainted with the weakness and impotence of the\r\nByzantines as a raid or as a temporary affair. For several years the\r\nGenoese had thought it to their advantage to seek the friendship of\r\nOrkhan.[241] In 1355 two far-sighted Venetians wrote the whole truth to\r\nthe Senate. They did not mince matters. Matteo Venier, baily at\r\nConstantinople, warned the Senate in the strongest terms about the\r\nmenace of Ottoman aggrandizement.[242] Marino Falieri went farther. He\r\npointed out that the Byzantine Empire must inevitably become the booty\r\nof the Osmanlis, and urged his countrymen to get ahead of them.[243]\r\nProphetic words and daring suggestion. Had Venice at this time had a\r\nDandolo of the stamp of the intrepid blind Doge who diverted the Fourth\r\nCrusade to wreak his vengeance upon his mutilators, Islam might have\r\nbeen kept out of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen John Palaeologos resumed the throne of his fathers, he found\r\nhimself as much at the mercy of Orkhan as Cantacuzenos had been. His\r\ndependence is revealed in the story of Halil. Halil, son of Orkhan and\r\nTheodora, was captured by pirates in 1357, and taken to Phocaea. Orkhan\r\nheld his brother-in-law responsible for this kidnapping, and called upon\r\nhim to rescue his nephew. In February 1358, while the Osmanlis under\r\nSoleiman pasha were advancing in Thrace, we see John V, at the behest\r\nof Orkhan, spending what strength and energy he had in the siege of\r\nPhocaea. Later, when he went back to Constantinople, Orkhan peremptorily\r\nordered him to return to direct in person the siege. John started out,\r\nand met his fleet, which had become anxious about his absence and had\r\ngiven up the siege. He could not persuade the galleys to turn back with\r\nhim. So he wrote to Orkhan begging to be excused from continuing an\r\nundertaking beyond his power to carry through successfully.\r\n\r\nOrkhan was inflexible. He had now become the overlord of the Byzantine\r\nemperor. In March 1359 the successor of Constantine went as a vassal to\r\nmeet his Ottoman suzerain at Scutari. He appeased the wrath of Orkhan\r\nonly by agreeing to pay a half of Halil’s ransom, and by signing a\r\ntreaty of peace that was a virtual acceptance of the new _status quo_ in\r\nThrace. The peace was to be sealed by the betrothal of his ten-year-old\r\ndaughter to Halil. It was as errand boy of Orkhan that John V made one\r\nmore trip to Phocaea, paid one hundred thousand pieces of gold for\r\nHalil, and brought him to Nicaea. There the betrothal of the Christian\r\nprincess to her Moslem cousin was celebrated by splendid fêtes.[244]\r\n\r\nJohn Cantacuzenos introduced the Osmanlis into Europe. John Palaeologos\r\naccepted their presence in Thrace without a struggle. There is little\r\nchoice between these two Johns.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nOrkhan died at the end of this memorable decade.[245] If to Osman is\r\ngiven the honour of being father of a new people, the greater honour of\r\nfounding the nation must be ascribed to Orkhan.[246] Few men have\r\naccomplished a greater work and seen more sweeping changes in two\r\ngenerations. According to popular legend, Orkhan won his spurs as a\r\nwarrior, and a bride to boot, at the capture of Biledjik, when he was\r\ntwelve years old. His life was spent in fighting and in making permanent\r\nthe results of his fighting. He was as simple in his tastes as his\r\nfather had been. At Nicaea he distributed soup and bread to the poor\r\nwith his own hands.[247]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no basis for the characterization of Orkhan which the\r\nearly western historians handed down to posterity. He was neither\r\nvicious nor cruel nor deceitful. His three striking characteristics were\r\nthose which mark all men who have accomplished a great work in history,\r\noneness of purpose, inexhaustible energy, and an unlimited capacity for\r\ndetail. He began life as a village lad of an obscure tribe. After a\r\npublic career of sixty years he died, the brother-in-law of the emperor\r\nof Byzantium, the friend and ally of Genoa, and potentially master of\r\nThrace. The purpose of his life is summed up in the sentence we find\r\nupon his coins: ‘May God cause to endure the empire of Orkhan, son of\r\nOsman.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMURAD\r\n\r\nTHE OSMANLIS LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF AN EMPIRE IN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of Ottoman mercenaries in the Byzantine civil wars was fatal to\r\nthe Empire. From the very fact that they were Osmanlis and mercenaries,\r\nthe auxiliaries of Cantacuzenos were dangerous allies for a man who\r\nclaimed to be fighting for his fatherland. The fertile valleys which\r\nBulgarian and Serbian had so long disputed with Greek fired the\r\nimagination of these ambitious adventurers. The conquest of Macedonia\r\nand Thrace seemed to them as feasible as it was worth while. For they\r\nhad a revelation of the weakness of the Balkan peoples that could have\r\ncome to them in no other way. It was as if Cantacuzenos had said to\r\nOrkhan and his followers: Here is our country. You see how rich it is.\r\nYou see how we hate each other, race striving with race, faction with\r\nfaction. We have no patriotism. We have no rulers or leaders actuated by\r\nother than purely selfish motives. Our religion means no more to us than\r\ndoes our fatherland. Here are our military roads. We give you the\r\nopportunity of becoming acquainted with the easiest routes, of learning\r\nthe best methods of provisioning. We initiate you into the art of\r\nbesieging our cities and our strongholds. Under our guidance, you\r\ndiscover the vulnerable places in the walls of our fortresses.\r\n\r\nMurad had not enjoyed training in leadership and responsibility to fit\r\nhim for his sudden accession to the chieftainship of the Osmanlis. He\r\nhad been overshadowed by the heir apparent, and never dreamed of ruling.\r\nSoleiman pasha, brilliant captain and idol of the army, would not have\r\nbrooked a rival in popular favour. When Orkhan died, two months after\r\nthe fatal fall of his eldest son at Bulaïr, Murad was elevated to the\r\nemirship before he had had time to adjust himself to his new fortunes.\r\nBut he could not pause to get his bearings. The army was on the march.\r\nThe conquest of Thrace had already been started.\r\n\r\nOsman and Orkhan were able to build up a race and a nation without\r\nnotice and, consequently, without hindrance. For their little corner of\r\nAsia Minor had been abandoned by the Byzantines. Since the days when\r\nNicaea became the capital of the empire, after the Latin conquest of\r\nConstantinople, its commercial relations with Europe were interrupted.\r\nNone knew or cared about the rise of the Osmanlis until they appeared in\r\nThrace. Orkhan had assured himself of his inheritance by patient\r\nwaiting. Of Murad immediate action was demanded.\r\n\r\nThe actual European conquests of Orkhan, outside of the Thracian\r\nChersonese, had been negligible. But Europe was excited over the capture\r\nof Gallipoli. Murad had little to fear from a union of the indigenous\r\nBalkan elements. Greek and Serbian and Bulgarian hate each other far\r\nworse than they hate the Osmanli. This fact of history, demonstrated so\r\nforcibly by the events of the year 1913, was known and appreciated at\r\nits full value by the earliest of the Ottoman conquerors. There was,\r\nhowever, just cause for apprehension of the intervention of Hungary in\r\nconjunction with the Serbians, or of Venice in conjunction with the\r\nByzantines. Murad’s success depended upon his ability to gain an\r\nimmediate and vital foothold in the Balkan peninsula.\r\n\r\nThis foothold was obtained in the epoch-making campaign of 1360-1.\r\nAstounding success attended the initial efforts of Murad. If he were not\r\nhimself a trained and seasoned warrior, he had a precious legacy of\r\ngenerals in whom he could put implicit trust. Realizing his own\r\ninexperience, he created Kara Khalil Tchenderli vizier, and allowed\r\nhimself to be guided by the judgement of this tried friend and servant\r\nof his grandfather and his father. To Lalashahin, companion of Soleiman\r\nin the capture of Tzympe, was given the title of beylerbey, and chief\r\ncommand of the army in Thrace. Adrianople was the goal. To Evrenos bey\r\nMurad entrusted a second army, whose mission was to prevent an attack\r\nfrom the Serbians in the west.[248]\r\n\r\nTchorlu was the first objective point, because its capture would protect\r\nthe rear of the army operating against Adrianople. This city, only\r\nforty-six miles from Constantinople, offered a stubborn resistance, and\r\nhad to be taken by assault. The commandant was decapitated, the garrison\r\nmassacred, and the walls razed.[249] The Osmanlis saw to it that the\r\nfate of the defenders of Tchorlu was heralded far and wide, so that it\r\nmight serve as a lesson to other cities before which their armies\r\nappeared. Evrenos bey, pushing forward on the left, occupied\r\nDemotika,[250] and then Gumuldjina. This operation gave to the Osmanlis\r\ncontrol of the basin of the Maritza River, and removed the danger of a\r\nSerbian attack. A column on the right moved up the coast of the Black\r\nSea and captured Kirk Kilisse, a position of extreme strategic\r\nimportance in preventing a possible Bulgarian attempt to relieve\r\nAdrianople by bringing an army through the mountainous country between\r\nthe river and the sea.[251]\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Tchorlu, Murad advanced to Lule Burgas on the north\r\nbank of the Ergene, where he effected a junction with the armies of\r\nEvrenos and Lalashahin. The decisive battle was fought between Bunar\r\nHissar and Eski Baba, to which point the defenders of Adrianople had\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EMIRATE OF MURAD]\r\n\r\nadvanced.[252] The Byzantines and Bulgarians were defeated. The Greek\r\ncommandant of Adrianople, with a portion of his army, managed to flee\r\ndown the Maritza to Enos.[253] it is one of the remarkable coincidences\r\nof history that the Osmanlis should have won the first battle which\r\nopened up to them their glorious future in Europe in exactly the same\r\nplace that was to witness five hundred and fifty years later their last\r\ndesperate stand in the Balkan peninsula.\r\n\r\nDeserted by their commandant, and overwhelmed by the disaster of Eski\r\nBaba, the inhabitants of Adrianople opened their gates to the\r\nOsmanlis.[254] Murad installed Lalashahin in Adrianople, and took up his\r\nown head-quarters in Demotika,[255] where he built a palace and a\r\nmosque. Lalashahin, before settling down in Adrianople, carried his\r\nvictorious arms up the valley of the Maritza as far as Philippopolis,\r\nwhich he fortified strongly. A stone bridge was built across the\r\nriver.[256] The occupation of Philippopolis not only gave to the\r\nOsmanlis an advantageous base of operations against the Bulgarians, but\r\nalso brought them the most fruitful source of revenue they had yet\r\nenjoyed. It enabled them to levy taxes upon the rice-growing industry.\r\nBulgarians and Serbians were both dependent upon the harvests of the\r\nrice fields around Philippopolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn fifteen months the Osmanlis had become masters of the principal\r\nstrategic points in Thrace. This great campaign, undertaken and carried\r\nthrough under the spur of necessity, was an auspicious beginning for the\r\nreign of Murad and for the supremacy of the Osmanlis in the Balkan\r\npeninsula. Europe was suffering from another visitation of the Black\r\nDeath.[257] The Balkan nations were completely demoralized. So unpopular\r\nwas John Palaeologos in his own capital that Murad contemplated entering\r\ninto a conspiracy with some Byzantine traitors to have John assassinated\r\nand complete the conquest of the empire.[258] If he did enter fully into\r\nthis plot, it was as fortunate for him that the undertaking failed as it\r\nwas for the Bulgarians in 1912 that their columns did not pierce the\r\nlines of Ottoman defence at Tchataldja. For the disaster that follows a\r\ntoo extended and too rapid subjugation of unassimilated masses is as\r\nsudden as it is irreparable. Durable empire-building is governed by a\r\nlaw of homogeneity.\r\n\r\nThe Osmanlis were still a race of limited numbers, and at the beginning\r\nof their existence as a nation. The process of assimilating the racial\r\nelements in conquered territories, begun by Osman when he first left the\r\nvillage of Sugut, could not be arrested; for the existence of the\r\nOttoman state depended upon its continuance. The Greek of Bithynia had\r\nlived with Turk and Moslem for two centuries, and had found him a good\r\nneighbour. There was neither racial antipathy nor abhorrence of the\r\nreligion of Mohammed to overcome. Nor had there been the hatred and\r\ndread of the conquered on the one side and the arrogance of the\r\nconqueror on the other. The Anatolian Greeks had been accustomed for\r\ngenerations to the economic and political conditions that finally caused\r\nthe majority of them to cast their fortunes with the rising star of the\r\nOsmanlis.\r\n\r\nThe problem of assimilating the Christians, who formed the total\r\npopulation of the Balkan peninsula, was a new one. Here were huge and\r\ncompact masses of Christians, who had come suddenly under the yoke of\r\nthe Osmanlis in the first two years of Murad’s reign. They did not know\r\ntheir new masters. They did not know Islam. Benevolent assimilation by\r\nvoluntary conversion seemed no longer possible. A radical change in the\r\nattitude of the Osmanlis towards the question of religion was demanded.\r\nWholesale massacre was impracticable, for the Osmanlis had no reserve of\r\ncolonists to call upon to replace the indigenous elements. Their\r\nposition was still too precarious to allow them to draw freely from\r\ntheir adherents in the corner of Asia Minor under their dominion. To win\r\nthe Macedonians and Thracians by forcible conversion was not feasible.\r\nIt required the expenditure of all his military resources for Murad to\r\nhold what he had conquered. He could not add police duty to his already\r\nsuperhuman burden. Even had he thought of this method of conversion, he\r\nwould have been deterred by the nightmare of a crusade.\r\n\r\nMurad and his counsellors solved the problem of assimilation by\r\nsanctioning the reduction of captives to slavery, and by creating the\r\ncorps of janissaries.\r\n\r\nA law was promulgated which gave to the Osmanli soldier absolute right\r\nto the possession of prisoners, unless they consented to profess and\r\npractise Islam. Prisoners were regarded as booty. They could be kept for\r\ndomestic or agricultural labour, or sold in the open market, subject to\r\nthe government’s equity of one in five. The disgrace, even more than the\r\nhardships, of slavery was so keenly felt by the Greeks[259] that many\r\nfor whom there was no other way preferred a change of religion to loss\r\nof freedom. The right to make slaves of prisoners was efficacious in\r\nproviding wives and concubines for the conquerors, who were practically\r\nwithout women of their own. The widows of the fallen, and the daughters\r\nof Greeks, Serbians, and Bulgarians, became the instruments of\r\nincreasing the Ottoman race. In the hundred years from Murad I to\r\nMohammed II, the Osmanlis became in blood the most cosmopolitan and\r\nvigorous race the world had known since the days of the Greeks and\r\nRomans. Greek, Turkish, Serbian, Bulgarian, Albanian, Armenian,\r\nWallachian, Hungarian, German, Italian, Russian, Tartar, Mongol,\r\nCircassian, Georgian, Persian, Syrian, and Arabian--this was the\r\nancestry of the Osmanlis who, under Soleiman the Magnificent, made the\r\nwhole world tremble. In richness of blood the only parallel to the\r\nOsmanlis in modern times is the present population of the United States\r\nand Canada.\r\n\r\nBut this indirect method of conversion as an alternative to slavery did\r\nnot immediately increase the masculine element among the Osmanlis. In a\r\ncity taken by assault the more virile portion of the male population was\r\nkilled off, and those who remained were able to buy life and freedom.\r\nMale slaves were an embarrassment to the ever-moving armies of Murad.\r\nRansom money was welcomed by the captors. In many cities the inhabitants\r\nsurrendered without a struggle, and were secured in their freedom by the\r\nterms of capitulation. In rural districts the threat of slavery was\r\nlittle felt. The Osmanlis had neither time nor strength to put out the\r\ndrag-net. Everywhere in the Balkans refuge in the mountains is easy.\r\nThen, too, the loss of cultivators would have made the highly prized\r\ntimarets worthless, and would have caused a famine in foodstuffs or a\r\ndiminution of taxes on harvests. Another means of bringing pressure to\r\nbear upon the Christians had to be devised.\r\n\r\nThe famous corps of the janissaries was, according to the Ottoman\r\nhistorians, a creation of Orkhan.[260] As a bodyguard of slaves, cut\r\noff from their families and educated and trained to serve nearest the\r\nperson of the sovereign, the janissaries may have originated with\r\nOrkhan. If so, it was but the adoption of the idea already put into\r\npractice by the sovereigns of Egypt in the organization of the\r\nMamelukes.[261] But as an agency of forcible conversion by the\r\nincorporation of Christian youths in the Ottoman army, there is no\r\nevidence of its existence before Murad. In fact, historians are agreed\r\nthat the janissaries were recruited only from the Christian population\r\nin Europe.[262] So Orkhan could hardly have conceived this scheme. The\r\nproblem of which it was a solution did not arise until after Orkhan’s\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThat the corps of the janissaries was an agency for forcible conversion,\r\nand was not created in order to increase the strength and efficiency of\r\nthe Ottoman army, is proved by the records we have of the number of\r\njanissaries in the early days of Ottoman history. Murad and Bayezid are\r\nrepresented as having a thousand or less janissaries. In the confusion\r\nof the ten years of civil strife among the sons of Bayezid, the\r\njanissaries played no part. There were only twelve hundred janissaries\r\nin the time of Mohammed the Conqueror,[263] and twelve thousand when the\r\nOttoman Empire was at its zenith under Soleiman the Magnificent.[264]\r\nBut Mahmud II counted one hundred and forty thousand in his army.[265]\r\nThese figures show that this most celebrated of Ottoman military\r\norganizations did not become a powerful factor until the period of\r\ndecadence. The janissaries were not, as has been commonly represented,\r\nthe principal element of the Osmanlis’ fighting strength in the wars of\r\nconquest of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Their great rôle in\r\nOttoman history was that of maintainers and defenders of conquests\r\nalready made. In organizing the janissaries, Murad was certainly\r\ninfluenced by the desire of forming a bodyguard on whose loyalty and\r\ndevotion he could rely implicitly. But his principal purpose was to\r\nemasculate the Christian elements in Macedonia and Thrace, which were\r\ntoo fanatical or too ignorant to see of their own accord that\r\nself-interest should lead them to renounce their nationality and their\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nMurad’s law of drafting (_devchurmé_) provided that in each conquered\r\ndistrict in Europe the privilege of exemption from military service\r\nthrough the payment of the capitation tax (_kharadj_) should be denied\r\nto Christian youths. The Osmanlis reserved the right to select at\r\ndiscretion Christian boys, who were taken from home and kindred and\r\nbrought up in the Mohammedan religion. They were trained for service as\r\nthe Sultan’s bodyguard. They depended directly upon the sovereign, who\r\npaid them according to a definite scale. Their insignia were the pot and\r\nthe spoon, and their officers received names which symbolized the\r\nfunctions of the camp kitchen.[266]\r\n\r\nOne is compelled to dissent from the consensus of opinion of European\r\nhistorians on the organization of the janissaries. Their scathing\r\ncriticisms are best summed up in the words of a French historian: ‘It is\r\nthe most fearful tribute of human flesh that has ever been levied by\r\nvictors upon the vanquished.... It justifies the execration of which the\r\nOsmanlis have been the object on the part of Europeans during centuries.\r\nLet us add that, by this strange mode of recruiting, the Osmanlis have\r\nfound, at the same time, the means of taking away from the Christian\r\npopulations their most virile element, and of doubling their troops\r\nwithout putting arms into the hands of the conquered.’[267]\r\n\r\nThe actual number of janissaries under arms refutes the latter part of\r\nthis criticism, when it is applied to any one of the Ottoman sovereigns\r\nof the period of conquest. As for putting arms into the hands of the\r\nconquered, we shall see that both Murad and Bayezid availed themselves\r\nof the services in war of their Christian subjects, led by their own\r\nprinces. The tearing away of boys from their homes, and the loss of\r\ntheir Christian heritage, is a shock to humanitarian and religious\r\nsensibilities. But we must judge the Osmanlis of Murad and Bayezid by\r\nthe Christians of their own century. When we compare the methods of\r\nconquest of the Osmanlis with those of the Spaniards against the Moors,\r\nof the English against the French and Scotch, of the Italians against\r\neach other, we must concede that Murad devised a humane, clever, and\r\nhighly successful scheme in the institution of the janissaries.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant Balkan peasantry--especially the Slavic elements--prized\r\ntheir sons far more highly than their daughters. Recruiting for the army\r\nwas a greater blow to them than recruiting for the harem. It was the\r\nstrong, sturdy son who was chosen. This touched the pocket-book as well\r\nas the heart-strings. The Anatolian Greek, especially of the cities,\r\nhad been deterred from becoming a Moslem more by a lack of eagerness to\r\nassume military obligations than by a zeal for his ancestral faith. The\r\nMacedonian Greek, the Bulgarian, and the Serbian regarded the bearing of\r\narms as a natural obligation. Fighting was a part of living. Better the\r\nfaith of Mohammed, then, than the loss of the son’s help with the\r\nharvest. That there were wholesale conversions to Islam as a result of\r\nthe threat to apply the law of _devchurmé_ is a logical inference from\r\nthe fact that Murad never mustered more than a thousand janissaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Byzantine Empire did not recover, even temporarily, from the effect\r\nof Murad’s first campaign in Europe. The fall of Demotika and\r\nAdrianople, followed so closely by that of Philippopolis, removed within\r\neighteen months the last hope of retrieving the fortunes of the empire.\r\nThere were still many places remaining to the Byzantines in Thrace. But\r\nthe surrender of the fortresses in the valleys of the Ergene and the\r\nMaritza had destroyed the military prestige of the Byzantines, and\r\nforeshadowed the speedy subjugation of the whole country. The loss of\r\nthe revenues of Thrace and of the great plain south of the main Balkan\r\nrange reduced the imperial treasury to dependence upon the port duties\r\nand city taxes of Salonika and Constantinople. For ninety years the\r\nshadow of the empire remained. But whatever power, whatever influence\r\nwas left to the successors of Constantine, it was rather in western\r\nEurope than in the Balkan peninsula. The impress of one thousand and\r\nthirty years of continuous existence from the renaming of old Byzantium\r\nto the fall of Adrianople was too deep to vanish in a few years. The\r\ndecay had been going on for centuries. The final extinction would of\r\nnecessity take several generations.\r\n\r\nThe complete abasement of the Byzantines is revealed in the treaty that\r\nJohn V Palacologos was compelled to conclude with Murad shortly after\r\nthe capture of Philippopolis. In the fall of 1362 or the spring of 1363,\r\nJohn bound himself to refrain from any attempt to win back what he had\r\nlost in Thrace, either by a separate attack or by joining the Serbians\r\nor other enemies of the Osmanlis. In addition he promised to aid Murad\r\nagainst his Anatolian enemies, the Turkish emirs.[268]\r\n\r\nAfter this treaty was signed, Murad withdrew to Brusa in order to\r\nprovide for the organization of the new possessions that had come to him\r\nby a successful expedition against Angora. His letters, written at this\r\ntime to announce to his Anatolian neighbours and to the Moslem princes\r\nof Asia the victories in Thrace, show clearly that he did not yet feel\r\nhimself strong enough to assume the position of overlord to the other\r\ngreat emirs of Asia Minor. While he was in Brusa, in the spring of 1363,\r\nan event happened which led Murad to make the momentous decision that\r\nshaped the destinies of the Ottoman Empire. The first coalition against\r\nthe Osmanlis was formed in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Philippopolis, the Greek commandant had succeeded in\r\nescaping, and took refuge with Kral Urosh V of Serbia.[269] He pointed\r\nout to Urosh most eloquently the paucity of numbers of the Osmanlis,\r\ntheir insecure position, and the danger that would overwhelm the\r\nSerbians if they waited until the Osmanlis were firmly grounded in\r\nThrace. Urged by Pope Urban V, the princes of Wallachia and Bosnia,\r\ntogether with King Louis of Hungary, joined the Serbians in upper\r\nMacedonia. Under the guidance of the Greek refugee, they started on a\r\nswift march to win back Adrianople. It was an expedition undertaken as\r\na crusade. The allies mustered at least twenty thousand.\r\n\r\nLalashahin had hardly more than twelve thousand men under his command,\r\nand a portion of these were scattered in the captured cities. Murad, who\r\nhad started to return to Thrace as soon as he had heard the news, was\r\ndetained by the necessity of capturing a fortress on the Sea of Marmora,\r\nnear Cyzicus, which was in the hands of a turbulent band of\r\nsecond-generation Catalans, whom he feared to leave behind him.[270]\r\nThey were suspected of plotting with his southern rivals to organize a\r\nmovement against his Anatolian possessions.\r\n\r\nIf the Greeks had had the power or the will to co-operate with the\r\ncrusaders, the Ottoman domination in Thrace would have ended even more\r\nsuddenly than it had begun. But they made no move. In fact, one of the\r\nByzantine historians charges John Palaeologos with aiding the\r\nOsmanlis![271] Lalashahin was able to draw from the garrisons of the\r\nrecently occupied cities, and to send forward to meet the crusaders some\r\nten thousand men under Hadji Ilbeki. It was the intention of Lalashahin\r\nto have this army act wholly on the defensive. If only Hadji Ilbeki\r\ncould prevent their passing the Maritza, they would be turned southward\r\ntowards Enos. By that time he felt sure that he could rely upon one of\r\nthree things happening: dissensions would arise among the crusaders, the\r\nGreeks would be alarmed by the Serbian approach to Enos and the sea and\r\nattack the crusaders, or Murad would have time to bring his army across\r\nthe Dardanelles. The one purpose of Lalashahin was to prevent the\r\ninvasion of Thrace and the investment of Adrianople.\r\n\r\nBut Hadji Ilbeki did better than keep the crusaders from crossing the\r\nriver. They had already crossed, and had celebrated the unopposed\r\npassage of the Maritza by an evening of feasting. Hadji Ilbeki surprised\r\nthem as they were sleeping in a drunken stupor.[272] Without hesitation\r\nhe fell upon them like a Gideon. Seized with panic, the crusaders were\r\ndriven back into the river. Those who escaped massacre and drowning fled\r\nprecipitately. There was no attempt to rally. In the little town of\r\nMariazell, on the northern frontier of Styria near the foot of the\r\nSemmering Alps, there stands a votive church built by Louis out of\r\ngratitude to the Virgin for having saved him from death in this\r\nbattle.[273]\r\n\r\nLalashahin, instead of rewarding the daring of his lieutenant, which had\r\nsaved the Osmanlis from an irreparable disaster, was consumed with\r\njealous fury. His only thought when he received the news was that Hadji\r\nIlbeki had robbed him of the glory of so great a victory. He had his too\r\nsuccessful subordinate poisoned.[274]\r\n\r\nThe sudden and complete collapse of the first crusade organized against\r\nthe Osmanlis did not give to Murad any false sense of security. He saw\r\nin the successful meeting of this danger, which had threatened to\r\ndestroy him, not the opportunity for exultation and for the relaxation\r\nof effort, but the spur for straining still further every nerve to learn\r\nand profit by the lesson. The battle of the Maritza was a warning to\r\nMurad. The danger would be renewed, and renewed soon. It was now for him\r\nto make the choice between remaining an Asiatic emir and becoming a\r\nEuropean sovereign, between endeavouring to impose first his authority\r\non the other emirs of Asia Minor and the conquest of the Balkan\r\npeninsula. Were the Osmanlis to be on the offensive in Europe or in\r\nAsia?\r\n\r\nMurad decided to build his empire in the Balkan peninsula. It was not\r\nthat he coveted less the mountains and valleys of Asia Minor. It was not\r\nthat his ambitions failed to extend to the Taurus. But he had the vision\r\nto realize that the Ottoman race could not subjugate the Turkish\r\nelements in Asia Minor by a gradual assimilation of those elements\r\nalone. The race had to grow, as it began, by the incorporation of the\r\nvarious Christian elements, which alone possessed the finesse, the\r\nknowledge of government, the organizing capacity necessary to cope with\r\nthe problems of facing Europe and inheriting the Byzantine Empire. From\r\nEurope, Asia Minor and more could be conquered: from Asia, no portion of\r\nEurope could be conquered.\r\n\r\nThe Osmanlis do not possess written records of the reign of Murad. There\r\nis no source to which we can go to read what Murad thought or what\r\nothers of his day thought or said that he thought. But we know his mind\r\nfrom his actions. There is no cause for doubt on this point. After the\r\nfirst campaign in Thrace, Murad had returned to Brusa, and dated his\r\nletters from there. He began to plan an aggressive campaign against his\r\nneighbours. But after the battle of the Maritza, he abandoned Brusa for\r\nDemotika, and three years later, in 1366, Adrianople became the first\r\nreal capital of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all that has been written about the unique position of Brusa\r\nin Ottoman history, it is no more to the Osmanlis than is Saint-Denis to\r\nthe French or Winchester to the English. The Osmanlis have never really\r\nbeen at home in Constantinople. Historically and architecturally\r\nspeaking, they have been under the shadow of a greater past.\r\nAdrianople, although always a city of importance since the days of\r\nHadrian, reached its greatest splendour and glory under the Ottoman\r\nsultans. Here were planned, and from here started, the expeditions\r\nwestward and eastward, which increased in strength, in efficiency, and\r\nin inspiring terror as the circle gradually widened, until the star and\r\ncrescent appeared under the walls of Vienna and Cairo, on the shores of\r\nItaly and in the heart of Persia. No student of Ottoman annals can fail\r\nto support the contention of the Sublime Porte after the last Balkan\r\nwar, that Adrianople is to the Osmanlis their sacred city. From\r\nLalashahin to Shukri pasha, the proudest and most precious memories of\r\nthe Osmanlis are in Adrianople, whose great mosque, still awe-inspiring\r\nand altogether admirable in its decay, is typical both of what has been\r\nand what is.\r\n\r\nThe decision of Murad was accepted by his successors. Even after the\r\ncapture of Constantinople, many an Ottoman sultan felt more at home in\r\nAdrianople than in the imperial city. For more than a century the\r\nOsmanlis directed their energies almost exclusively to European\r\nconquests. Whatever they accomplished in Asia was the indirect result of\r\ntheir stupendous successes in Europe. From first to last, the extension\r\nof Ottoman sovereignty over the Moslems of Asia was by means of a\r\nsoldiery gathered and war-hardened in Europe, themselves Christian or of\r\nChristian ancestry, in whose veins ran the blood of Greek and Roman, of\r\nGoth and Hun, of Albanian and Slav.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIn 1365, Murad received from the outside world the first acknowledgement\r\nof his commanding position as heir apparent of the Byzantine Empire. It\r\nwas an overture from the flourishing republic of Ragusa, on the\r\nDalmatian coast, for a treaty guaranteeing freedom of trade in the\r\nOttoman dominions to the merchants of Ragusa. In return for\r\nunrestricted commercial privileges, the republic offered to pay a large\r\nsum annually, which the givers called a grant, but which was invariably\r\naccepted by the recipients as tribute.[275] However it may have been at\r\nthe beginning, the grant soon became tribute, for after some years the\r\nexistence of Ragusa depended upon purchasing the benevolence of the\r\nOttoman sultans. As the helplessness of the Ragusans increased, the\r\ntribute became larger. If we except the convention between the Genoese\r\nand Orkhan, of whose provisions and character we know nothing, the\r\nRagusan commercial treaty is the first of the long series of treaties by\r\nwhich European cities and nations purchased the right to trade in the\r\nOttoman Empire and to sail the high seas. Since in most cases the\r\nOsmanlis pledged themselves to nothing except to refrain from robbing\r\nmerchants or from preventing their trading, the gifts exacted were\r\nnothing less than blackmail. After the sea-power of the Osmanlis had\r\nbeen broken, the Barbary corsairs inherited the privileges of this\r\nsystem which had been started in so small a way by the Ragusans.\r\n\r\nMurad could not write. When the treaty with Ragusa was brought for his\r\nsignature, he put his hand in the ink and made the impression of his\r\nfingers upon the paper. This is the origin of the _tughra_, which has\r\never since been the official signature of the house of Osman.[276]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWhen Murad was settling himself in Adrianople, and laying plans for the\r\nconquest of Macedonia and Bulgaria, he was menaced by a new crusade.\r\nDespite its futile ending, or better, for that very reason, the\r\nexpedition of Amadeo of Savoy in 1366 commands our attention. For it\r\nfurnishes, as does the expedition of Admiral Boucicaut from Genoa in\r\n1399, a striking illustration of how easily the growing Ottoman power\r\nmight have been crushed by a resolute body of crusaders with a single\r\naim, and of how impossible it was to secure that oneness of purpose,\r\nowing to the ingrained animosity of the East and West, of the Greek and\r\nCatholic Churches.\r\n\r\nIn 1361, when Lorenzo Celsi was elevated to the dogeship of Venice, the\r\nSenate had made overtures to John Palaeologos for an alliance against\r\nMurad.[277] This plan was frustrated by the successes of the Osmanlis in\r\nThrace. The Venetians held back, and allowed John to suffer the\r\nhumiliation of signing the treaty that made him a vassal of Murad. In\r\nthe crusade that ended in the disaster of the Maritza, the Venetian\r\nparticipation was half-hearted, and it proved valueless. The Venetians\r\nwere not even on hand to prevent Murad from crossing the Dardanelles. In\r\nfact, there is every reason to believe that they now began to look upon\r\nthe Osmanlis as a valuable tool in checkmating the ambition of Louis of\r\nHungary to inherit the shortlived empire of Stephen Dushan.[278]\r\n\r\nWhen he saw that Murad had come into Thrace to stay, and that there was\r\nno hope from the Venetians, John Palaeologos turned to the Hungarians.\r\nHe made a secret visit to Buda to enlist the aid of Louis, and made the\r\nusual promise that the Byzantines would return to the Roman fold.[279]\r\nOn his return he passed through the principality of Sisman, who had just\r\ninherited the lower portion of Bulgaria. Sisman, either at the\r\nsuggestion of Andronicus Palaeologos, who wanted to succeed his father,\r\nor in the hope of winning favour with Murad, detained the emperor in\r\nthe fortress of Nicopolis on the Danube.[280]\r\n\r\nAmadeo VI of Savoy was one of the princes who had taken the cross from\r\nPope Urban V at Avignon on Holy Friday, 1363, for the crusade that never\r\nmaterialized. The receipt of a letter from Louis of Hungary, informing\r\nhim of the imprisonment of his cousin (John’s mother was a princess of\r\nSavoy), and pointing out the rapid spread of Ottoman power, caused\r\nAmadeo to yield to the Pope’s continued and urgent solicitations.[281]\r\nWith some fifteen hundred soldiers, he embarked for the East on fifteen\r\ngalleys. After a stop at Negropont and Mitylene to get reinforcements,\r\nAmadeo entered the Hellespont, and captured Gallipoli without\r\ndifficulty. The Osmanlis fled by night, abandoning the fortress.[282]\r\n\r\nBut the Savoyards made no attempt to follow up this victory, or even to\r\nkeep Gallipoli. Instead of attacking the infidels, they sailed into the\r\nBlack Sea, and started a vigorous campaign against the Bulgarians.\r\nSozopolis and Burgas were captured, and several other important\r\nfortresses to the north. The bravery of the crusaders was rivalled only\r\nby their cruelty. Their bloodlust made such an impression upon the\r\nBulgarians that they wanted nothing to do with Franks bearing the cross.\r\nWhen the Savoyards laid siege to Varna, Sisman gave up his prisoner to\r\nsave the city.\r\n\r\nJohn Palaeologos was borne back triumphantly to Constantinople. But\r\nfriction soon arose. When Amadeo urged upon his kinsman the necessity\r\nof paying the price of his rescue and of the continued support of the\r\ncrusaders by fulfilling his promise to return to the Roman Church, he\r\nmet with stubborn refusal on the part of emperor and patriarch alike. In\r\nwild rage, Amadeo withdrew to Pera, and began to fight the Greeks by sea\r\nand land. The Constantinopolitans were so frightened that ‘they did not\r\ndare to show their head out of doors’. Pressed on all sides by Osmanli\r\nand Bulgarian, as well as by his deliverers, the wretched John saw no\r\nother way out than to promise openly to abjure his errors and swear\r\nallegiance to the Pope.\r\n\r\nHaving wrung this promise from those whom he had come to defend, Amadeo\r\nsailed away to Rome, where he reported to the Pope in full consistory\r\n‘how at his request the emperor of Constantinople and his people desired\r\nto submit to the obedience and belief of the Holy Roman Church in hope\r\nthat the Church would aid them against the infidels who were too\r\nstrongly oppressing them’.\r\n\r\nUrban and the cardinals listened without great interest to the Count of\r\nSavoy’s recital of his success in preparing the ground for a reunion of\r\nthe churches. The story was getting to be an old one. John’s overture\r\nwas received with suspicion. Urban had got the same promise in the\r\nspring of 1366 in a letter from Louis, which reported the interview John\r\nhad sought at Buda.[283] To the envoy of Louis, who had arrived in\r\nAvignon just as Urban was starting for Rome, the Pope gave a letter\r\ncommanding the King of Hungary to put off his crusade until the union of\r\nthe churches was actually accomplished.[284]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nWhat lay behind the eagerness of Urban, at the beginning of his reign,\r\nto revive the crusades? Was he burning with holy zeal to recover the\r\nsepulchre of Christ from the hands of the Moslems? Was his heart set on\r\nprotecting Cyprus and Rhodes? Had he determined to leave no stone\r\nunturned to protect the Byzantines and other eastern Christians from the\r\nencroachment and persecution of Murad? His letters indicate that his\r\nchief interest was the recovery of the lost power and glory of the\r\npapacy. There is the same revelation in the letters of his immediate\r\nsuccessor, Gregory XI. These two popes had no catholic vision. They\r\ntried to keep their position as arbiters between France and England and\r\nSpain at Avignon, and at the same time to inherit the temporal power of\r\nthe decaying Holy Roman Empire by circumventing the Visconti of Milan.\r\nThe great schism in the Western Church, which so aided Murad and Bayezid\r\nin laying solidly the foundations of an empire in Europe, was the\r\noutcome of the short-sighted and purely selfish policy of these two\r\npopes. How far from the truth it is to represent them as courageously,\r\nwhole-heartedly, and persistently endeavouring to awaken the interest\r\nand attention of Europe in the peril from the East!\r\n\r\nThe fall of Adrianople and of Philippopolis should have been a warning\r\nto Urban. He read in it, however, not a glorious opportunity to\r\ndemonstrate the solidarity of Christendom by driving the Moslems out of\r\nEurope and rescuing fellow Christians from apostasy, slavery, and death,\r\nbut an occasion to force the schismatic Greeks to return to the Roman\r\ncommunion. Of the popes of the fourteenth century, Urban had the\r\ngreatest chance to prove himself a worthy champion of Christ and\r\ncivilization. For it was during his reign that the Osmanlis began their\r\nconquests and their proselytizing in Europe. At the beginning they could\r\neasily have been checked. But it never occurred to Urban that there was\r\na common interest of Christendom higher than and outside of the Roman\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nThe fault lay not wholly with Urban and with Gregory. They reflected the\r\nspirit of their age. But it does no credit to their personal character\r\nnor to the high position which they held to say that they were the\r\nvictims, rather than the masters, of the prevailing bigotry and\r\nignorance of their generation. In the fourteenth century, the West had\r\nalready begun to try to impose its commerce, its customs, its laws, and\r\nits religion upon the East. There was not, nor has there ever been\r\nsince, a sympathetic ‘give and take’ between Occident and Orient. In a\r\nmint, if the coin when stamped does not correspond exactly to the mould,\r\nit is rejected. Similarly the West, when it tries to put every eastern\r\npeople through its mould and finds no exact correspondence, rejects.\r\nHence, on the one side, the scorn of the ‘I am better than thou’: on the\r\nother side, a hatred born not only of fear and of conviction of\r\ninferiority, but of a sense of injustice which is none the less vital\r\nfrom a knowledge that the wrong is not, and will not be, righted.\r\n\r\nAmadeo of Savoy, uncivilized, fanatical through ignorance, the fertile\r\nbreeding-ground of fanaticism, true and unchanged descendant of the\r\nFourth Crusaders, was a prophetic figure at Constantinople in 1366. He\r\nrepresented the only possible type of deliverer for Byzantium. But\r\ndeliverance on his terms the Greeks would not accept. Death or Islam\r\nwere preferable. And who can blame them? Two years before Amadeo’s\r\nexpedition, the Greeks of Crete had risen in rebellion against their\r\nVenetian overlords because an attempt had been made to impose upon them\r\nthe Latin faith and rites.[285] When they were hunted down and massacred\r\nfor refusing to worship after the western fashion, not only Pope Urban,\r\nbut also Petrarch, wrote to the Doge congratulating him upon his valiant\r\nand successful efforts to save the Church of Christ in Crete![286]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Pope Urban, Petrarch spoke with approval of the policy of\r\nusing the Ottoman menace to stamp out the Eastern heresy. ‘The Osmanlis\r\nare merely enemies,’ he wrote, ‘but the schismatic Greeks are worse than\r\nenemies. The Osmanlis hate us less, for they fear us less. The Greeks,\r\nhowever, both fear and hate us with all their soul.’[287] These words of\r\nPetrarch epitomize the feeling between the Eastern and Western Churches\r\nduring his own day, and, if what one can see with his own eyes in\r\nJerusalem and elsewhere is a fair example, up to the twentieth\r\ncentury.[288]\r\n\r\nIf the European nations regarded the adherents of the Orthodox Church\r\n(the term Greek in its religious sense must be taken to include all the\r\nBalkan races) as ‘worse than enemies’, that is, than the Osmanlis, it is\r\nequally true that the Osmanlis found from 1350 to 1500 that the hatred\r\nof the Balkan races for the Latin Church was their most potent ally, not\r\nonly in the actual conquest, but in reconciling the conquered to their\r\nfate. One does not want to detract from the genius of the early Ottoman\r\nsovereigns and from the reputation for superb fighting ability so\r\nhonestly won by the Ottoman armies. But it must not be forgotten that\r\neach separate race in the Balkans preferred the rule of the Osmanlis to\r\nthat of their neighbours, and that the one point in which the Balkan\r\nraces were of the same mind was that Ottoman domination was preferable\r\nto that of the Hungarians and the Italians. For every crusade was a\r\nscheme for religious propaganda and territorial aggrandizement, in just\r\nthe same spirit as in modern times the nations of Europe have exploited\r\nthe misery of Ottoman Christians for the purpose of securing\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that John Palaeologos was informed by the Patriarch\r\nPhilotheus that a mixed council of clergy and government officials,\r\npresided over by the empress, had been held in June 1376, and had\r\ndecided against the reunion of the churches,[289] John persisted in his\r\nnegotiations with the Pope. Urban did all that he could to facilitate\r\nthe visit of the Byzantine emperor to Rome.[290] But at the same time he\r\nwas writing to the Venetians and to the Dalmatian cities to protect the\r\nCatholics of Cattaro against the Serbian and Albanian heretics,[291] and\r\nwas encouraging Louis in his suicidal campaign against the Bulgarians.\r\n\r\nIn 1369, John Palaeologos left the government of Constantinople to his\r\nelder son Andronicus, and set out for Rome, where, on October\r\neighteenth, he made his profession of faith in the presence of four\r\ncardinals, and confirmed it by a golden bull. The next morning, at St.\r\nPeter’s, he formally abjured the errors of the Orthodox Church before\r\nthe high altar, with his hands in those of the Pope.[292] The Pope\r\naccepted him as a ‘son of the Church’, promised that he should be\r\nrelieved of the Turk, and gave him letters earnestly recommending his\r\ncause to the princes of Christendom.[293]\r\n\r\nUrban V was quick to use the prestige which he believed the adhesion of\r\nJohn Palaeologos had given him. He announced broadcast the happy\r\nconsummation of his efforts, stating that the Byzantine emperor had done\r\nhomage to the Vicar of Christ in St. Peter’s.[294] But letters sent\r\nduring the same winter to the Greek clergy, urging them to accept the\r\naction of their emperor,[295] and other letters from his secret\r\ncorrespondence of this year, indicate how little faith he had in the\r\nEmperor’s sincerity or ability to fulfil his promises. Was the\r\nabjuration in St. Peter’s a farce, in which Emperor and Pope allowed\r\nthemselves to trifle with holy things, each for the sake of his\r\nimmediate advantage?\r\n\r\nJohn had hoped that his adhesion to the Roman Church would bring to him\r\ngrants of money, ships, and men from the Latin princes, and that an army\r\nwould rally around him to fight the Osmanlis. But not only did he return\r\nfrom France ‘with empty hands’, but he was detained at Venice because of\r\ndebts owing to merchants. In vain he begged Andronicus to send the money\r\nfor his release. The son who had four years before been charged with\r\nbeing party to his father’s imprisonment in Bulgaria was no more filial\r\nat this humiliating crisis. He answered that there was no money in the\r\ntreasury, and that he could get nothing from the clergy. But his younger\r\nson, Manuel, brought from Salonika the ransom.[296]\r\n\r\nJohn Palaeologos returned to his capital poorer than when he left. He\r\nbrought no help from Europe, and he had bound himself publicly by oath\r\nto an obligation which he had known he could not fulfil. He had broken\r\nfaith with Murad, who during these years had been growing more and more\r\npowerful. There was nothing for him to do but to make himself tributary\r\nto Murad in order that he might enjoy ‘up to the end of his life’ his\r\nlast possessions in peace.[297] Three years later, in 1373, when his\r\nambassador John Lascaris failed in a second attempt to get aid from the\r\nWestern princes,[298] the Byzantine emperor recognized Murad as his\r\nsuzerain, promised to do military service in person in Murad’s army, and\r\ngave to him his son Manuel as hostage.[299]\r\n\r\nUrban died a few months after John’s visit to Rome. Gregory XI, who\r\nsucceeded him in December 1370, had little hope of carrying on further\r\nnegotiations with the Eastern Church; for the Greek ecclesiastics were\r\nstubborn in their determination to maintain the absolute independence of\r\nthe patriarchate. The Genoese and Venetians were fighting bitterly in\r\nCyprus. In 1371, Gregory made a strong appeal to France, England,\r\nVenice, and Flanders to co-operate with Genoa in saving the last\r\nChristians of the Holy Land.[300] There was no response.\r\n\r\nThat Gregory realized clearly the peril to Christendom in the advance of\r\nMurad’s armies is shown in two remarkable letters written to Louis of\r\nHungary in May and November 1372. His words were prophetic. He urged\r\nLouis to resist the Osmanlis before they advanced farther into Europe.\r\nThey had already entered Serbia. He trembled to think what would happen\r\nif they pushed through Albania and secured a port on the Adriatic.\r\nUnless Louis entered without delay into an alliance with his Christian\r\nneighbours, how could he protect his own kingdom and all Christendom\r\nfrom the Mohammedan peril.[301] Seconding this warning to the King of\r\nHungary, the Pope commanded the Hungarian and Slavic archbishops to\r\npreach the crusade in Hungary, Poland, and the Dalmatian cities.\r\nEverywhere special boxes were placed in the churches for collecting\r\nfunds. A tithe was levied on the monasteries and abbeys of Hungary and\r\nDalmatia. Louis, with five of his most powerful nobles, took the cross,\r\nand swore to the Pope that he would put an army in the field within a\r\nyear.[302] Louis asked Venice for triremes, but when the Venetians found\r\nthat he intended them to be a donation for ‘the common cause’, they\r\nfound that they could not build them.[303] Padua declined an invitation\r\nto guarantee the cost of construction. The Hungarians did not fulfil\r\ntheir promises. In fact, there is no evidence that they made any effort\r\nto acquit themselves of their oath.\r\n\r\nWhen John Palaeologos made a last desperate appeal to the Pope, before\r\nhe entered into his third and final compact with Murad, Gregory, in\r\nreceiving the imperial envoy, burst into tears, and promised that he\r\nwould save Constantinople, if only the Byzantine emperor would cause his\r\npeople to renounce their heresies and return to the Roman Church. In\r\n1375, he wrote once more to Louis to inform him that Constantinople was\r\nin danger of capture from Murad.[304] Letters in the same year to Edward\r\nof England pictured the Ottoman advance and the peril of Christendom,\r\nurged a general war against the Osmanlis, and asked for a subsidy to\r\nprovide galleys ‘to prevent the crossing into Europe of more Turks,\r\nbecause Constantinople is in imminent danger’.[305] The letters of\r\nGregory XI to the Christian princes prove conclusively that the full\r\nimport of Murad’s early successes was understood by the Pope and was\r\nimpressed upon both secular and ecclesiastical authorities throughout\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nBut both John and Gregory lost heart. Neither was able to fulfil the\r\ncompact made in Rome. Gregory could not unite Christendom to relieve the\r\nByzantines. John could not persuade the Byzantines to renounce, as he\r\nhad done, the ‘Greek heresies’. So, as we have seen, he became Murad’s\r\nvassal.[306] The Pope, involved in the quarrel of Emperor Charles IV and\r\nthe Duke of Bavaria with the Marquis of Brandenburg, and anxious over\r\nthe outcome, for the papacy, of the continual unrest in the Italian\r\ncities, returned from Avignon to Rome in 1378. He died a few months\r\nlater.[307] The struggle arising from the election of Gregory’s\r\nsuccessor gave birth to the ‘Great Schism’. This left Murad a free hand\r\nin subjugating the Balkan peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThe sources of information for the movements from the outside for the\r\nrelief of the Balkan Christians, and for the religious and political\r\nquarrels of the Byzantines, are so numerous and so detailed that one is\r\nembarrassed by too much material. Many interesting facts cannot even be\r\nmentioned. But when we come to the beginning of the Ottoman conquest in\r\nEurope under Murad and Bayezid, we find ourselves in the midst of what\r\nan eminent Slavic historian has called ‘the most obscure and difficult\r\nperiod of South-Slavic history’.[308] The chroniclers, whether they be\r\nSlavic, Rumanian, or Ottoman, are so contradictory and so lacking in\r\nexplicit statement that we cannot speak with certainty of the sequence\r\nof events. The Byzantine chroniclers, verbose to the point of weariness\r\nin detailing petty and trifling quarrels and happenings, are almost\r\nsilent concerning the momentous events that marked the ruin of their\r\nempire. It is difficult to unravel the twisted skeins, and find a thread\r\nto carry the story of the conquest from 1366 to 1389. When it is\r\nimpossible to choose between contradictory records, the geography of the\r\nfield of action, with which one can gain a first-hand knowledge, must\r\nbe the final factor in determining the sequence of conquest between the\r\nadoption of Adrianople by Murad as his capital and the downfall of the\r\nSerbians at Kossova.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Adrianople and Philippopolis was as severe a blow to\r\nthe Bulgarians as to the Byzantines. In spite of the fact, however, that\r\nGreek and Bulgarian had a common interest in driving the Osmanli from\r\nThrace, or at the very least in checking his advance, there was no move\r\nmade at this time for an alliance. On the contrary, even when the\r\nOsmanlis were engaged in the Thracian campaign, war arose between John V\r\nand Alexander. The Byzantines captured Anchiale, and tried desperately\r\nto take Mesembria by assault.[309] The Greek patriarch wrote to Czar\r\nAlexander, reminding him of the sacredness of harmony and the necessity\r\nof accord at that critical moment, but the letter was not backed by the\r\ngood faith and good will of the Byzantine emperor. Neither John nor\r\nAlexander attempted to give assistance to the Serbian and Hungarian\r\ncrusade that ended so disastrously on the banks of the Maritza.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Bulgaria up to the main Balkan range imposed itself upon\r\nMurad as a corollary to the Ottoman dominion in Thrace, and the\r\nundisturbed possession of Adrianople and Philippopolis. For the\r\nBulgarians, through centuries of varying fortunes, had grown accustomed\r\nto fighting for the right to live in Thrace. Often had they been beaten\r\nback to the Balkans, and as often pressed forward again to the Ergene.\r\nTo win and lose Adrianople and other Thracian cities was old history\r\nwith them. They always came back. Between 1362 and 1365, Murad had\r\nexperience with Bulgarian persistence and tenacity of purpose. They were\r\nmasters again of Kirk Kilisse, Midia, Bunar Hissar, and Viza when Murad\r\nmade his change of capital from Brusa to Adrianople. Yamboli had been\r\nstrongly fortified by Alexander. Bulgaria seemed as formidable and as\r\nforbidding to Murad’s dream of empire as the emirates of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nFortune again favoured the Osmanlis. Czar Alexander died in 1365,[310]\r\nleaving three heirs. To John Sisman fell middle and southern Bulgaria\r\nfrom the Danube to the Rhodope Mountains and the Bulgarian pretensions\r\nin Thrace. Old Tirnovo was his capital. Stracimir inherited western\r\nBulgaria, with Widin for capital, and the Bulgarian pretensions to the\r\nvalley of the Vardar and western Macedonia. (The Bulgarian remnant of\r\neastern Macedonia was in the hands of an independent Bulgarian prince,\r\nConstantine, whose stronghold was Kustendil.) Dobrotich became master of\r\nthe Dobrudja and the upper Black Sea coast, where Bulgarian, Cuman and\r\nAlan lived together with hardly any distinguishing characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe division of Bulgaria, at the moment when union was essential, proved\r\nfatal. The sons of Alexander never joined to face the common danger. So\r\nmarked was the division of Alexander’s kingdom that thirty years after\r\nthe conquest the conquered territories were known as ‘the three\r\nBulgarias’.[311]\r\n\r\nStracimir, jealous because Sisman seemed to have received the lion’s\r\nshare of Alexander’s inheritance, did not hesitate to make overtures to\r\nMurad, offering to co-operate with the Osmanlis against his brother and\r\nto share the portion of Sisman with them.[312] Before any agreement\r\ncould be made, however, Stracimir found himself face to face with a\r\nterrible danger in the west, which soon caused him to forget both Sisman\r\nand Murad. Louis of Hungary had interpreted his crusader’s commission\r\nas an authorization to ‘make war against the heretics’. It was a pretext\r\nto get possession of Widin, which was essential to his ambitious project\r\nof adding Serbia to his kingdom. He attacked the Bulgarians on the\r\nground that they were enemies of the Church and must be forced to\r\nacknowledge the supremacy of Rome. Widin was captured and Stracimir\r\nimprisoned.[313] Stracimir’s dominions were flooded with Franciscan\r\nmissionaries, who were backed by a brutal soldiery in their\r\nproselytizing efforts.[314] Two hundred thousand Bulgarians abjured the\r\northodox heresy, and were re-baptized in the Latin rite. This forcible\r\nconversion, which was purely a political matter, was as objectionable to\r\nthe Bulgarians as to the Cretans. They hated ‘with a perfect hatred’ the\r\nFranciscans whom Pope Urban had sent, and the cause for which they\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nAt the first opportunity, the Bulgarians of the west called in Sisman\r\nand Vadislav of Wallachia. The Hungarians were driven out of Widin and\r\nthe Franciscans in the city massacred.[315] Louis was powerful enough to\r\nwreak terrible vengeance. In 1370, Widin fell once more into his hands.\r\nThe Bulgarians of the western Balkans were subjected to such a\r\nrelentless persecution that they welcomed the Moslem conquest to secure\r\nfreedom of worship. Urban had incited Louis to this war, and had\r\ncongratulated him upon his laudable zeal in converting the\r\nheretics.[316]\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the punishment that came to Sisman as a result\r\nof the detention of John Palaeologos. The Italian crusaders on the Black\r\nSea coast were as powerful an aid to Murad’s empire-building as were the\r\nHungarian crusaders on the western frontier. The successors of Louis\r\nreaped the bitter fruits of his insane policy. Louis and Amadeo of Savoy\r\ncontributed in no little measure to make possible the conquests of\r\nMurad. When Amadeo withdrew from Bulgaria, he left the cities he had\r\ncaptured to the Greeks. Sisman was compelled to expend his energy in\r\nrecapturing them. But Murad had already anticipated him in the important\r\nfortress of Sozopolis, which commanded the entrance to the port of\r\nBurgas.[317]\r\n\r\nShortly after the Ottoman occupation of Sozopolis, the Bulgarians were\r\neverywhere dispossessed in Thrace, and the capture of Yamboli[318]\r\nforced Sisman to follow the example of John Palaeologos. He became a\r\nvassal of Murad. His sister Mara entered Murad’s harem, but with the\r\nstipulation that she be allowed to retain her Christian faith.\r\n\r\nMurad gladly gave his new ally and brother-in-law a strong Ottoman army\r\nto co-operate in the attack upon the Hungarians. The Osmanlis helped in\r\ndriving Louis out of Widin. Sisman, like Cantacuzenos, first guided the\r\nOsmanlis through the heart of his country. It was under the leadership\r\nof Sisman that they saw the Danube, their river of destiny. When Sisman,\r\neven with the help of the Osmanlis and Wallachians, could not gain\r\npossession of Stracimir’s inheritance, he returned to Tirnovo. There he\r\nlearned that Lalashahin was planning an expedition westward, which\r\nseemed to be intended against Sofia.\r\n\r\nSisman now realized that his position was critical and that the fate of\r\nBulgaria was at stake. In the early spring of 1371, he hurried into the\r\nRilo Mountains and sent out an appeal to the Serbian kral who was at\r\nthat time ruling in eastern Macedonia. Then he went to the relief of\r\nIshtiman, which was already menaced by the Osmanlis. Failing in this\r\neffort, Sisman fell back to Samakov, where he was joined by the\r\nSerbians. Lalashahin led his army from Ishtiman into the valley of the\r\nIsker. The two krals joined battle with him in the plain of Samakov.\r\nThe Ottoman victory was decisive.[319] The Serbians and Bulgarians fled\r\ninto the recesses of Musalla, the highest mountain in the Balkan\r\npeninsula, and of Popova Shapka. Sisman disappeared after the\r\nbattle.[320] The way to Sofia was open. All Bulgaria lay at the feet of\r\nthe conqueror. It is from the battle of Samakov that we must date the\r\ndestruction of an independent Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nBut Murad was not yet ready to follow up this decisive victory. The only\r\nimmediate result of the battle of Samakov was the submission of\r\nConstantine, Bulgarian prince of Kustendil, in the upper valley of the\r\nStruma. After the fall of Samakov, his position was untenable.\r\nConstantine hurried to Murad’s camp, and did homage to the conqueror.\r\nMurad gave back to him as vassal his principality.[321] With the wisdom\r\nthat marked every successive step of his progress in Europe, Murad\r\nrefrained from advancing beyond Samakov. He ordered Lalashahin to lead\r\nthe army into Macedonia, and to join Evrenos in the advance towards the\r\nVardar.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThe dramatic death of Stephen Dushan, in 1355, just as he was starting\r\nupon the expedition against Constantinople for which his whole life had\r\nbeen a preparation, is recorded in the previous chapter. Stephen’s son\r\nwas so unfit to inherit the aspirations and carry on the work of his\r\nfather that he was called in derision by his people Nejaki, the\r\nweakling.[322] The nobles and generals of Stephen Nejaki ignored him.\r\nEach man seized what territory he could hold and defend against his\r\nneighbour. There was anarchy in Macedonia and Serbia. The dissolution of\r\nStephen Dushan’s conquests resulted in a bloody and destructive civil\r\nwar between cities and factions.[323] The dowager Czarina managed to\r\npreserve a semblance of prestige, if not of authority, at Serres. But\r\nthe ‘empire’ was no more. As local rulers, Serbians stayed in the\r\nprincipal cities of Macedonia. There was undoubtedly a Serbian element\r\nin the village population. Many villagers, however, who acknowledged the\r\noverlordship of Stephen’s warriors and other Serbian nobles, did not\r\nknow then, _any more than they know now_, to what race they themselves\r\nbelonged. This has always been the Macedonian problem.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the crusaders on the banks of the Maritza in 1363 had been\r\na defensive battle on the part of the Osmanlis. There was no attempt to\r\ninvade Macedonia. While Murad was occupied in the subjugation of Thrace\r\nand of southern Bulgaria, several efforts were made by the Byzantines to\r\ncome to an understanding with the Serbians. In 1364, the patriarch\r\nCallixtus went to Serres to see Stephen’s widow, who had retired to a\r\nconvent. His purpose was to form an alliance. Soon after reaching\r\nSerres, Callixtus succumbed to the hardships of the journey.[324] His\r\neffort came to nothing. That Stephen’s son still held to the pretensions\r\nof his father and had no intention of treating with the Byzantines, is\r\ndemonstrated by a bull, dated from Pristina in 1365, in which he calls\r\nhimself ‘emperor of the Servians and of the Greeks’.[325]\r\n\r\nStephen Urosh, the ‘weakling’, died in 1367.[326] Uglesa, who usurped\r\nthe kralship of Serres and shared the ‘empire’ of Stephen Dushan with\r\nhis brothers and fellow adventurers, Vukasin and Goiko,[327] sent an\r\nembassy to the patriarch Philotheos declaring that he would annul the\r\nbull of 1352, by which Dushan had created an autocephalous Serbian\r\nChurch,[328] and would cause all the Serbians to return to the Orthodox\r\nallegiance.[329] After three years of negotiation, precious time wasted\r\nwith trifling formalities, the reconciliation and union of the Serbian\r\nand Greek Churches was effected.[330] But, if we are to believe the\r\nauthorities of Orbini, Uglesa, while he was negotiating with the Greeks\r\nof Constantinople, had levied tribute upon the Greeks of Salonika, and\r\nwould have made himself master of Salonika, had not his untimely death\r\nprevented the consummation of the great Serbian dream.[331]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the reconciliation with the Orthodox Church, Uglesa had\r\ncompleted a plan of united action with his two brothers to oppose the\r\nOttoman invasion of Macedonia.[332] Uglesa had been informed that a\r\ngreat army was gathered in Adrianople, which awaited the return of Murad\r\nfrom Bulgaria to commence its march. Four weeks after the negotiations\r\nwith the Byzantines had been successfully concluded, in the early summer\r\nof 1371, the Serbian army reached the Maritza at Cernomen,[333] between\r\nAdrianople and Svilen.[334] This battle has been confused with the\r\nearlier battle of 1363, and it is impossible to separate the accounts of\r\nthe two actions.[335] The Osmanlis were again victorious. Uglesa and\r\nGoiko were drowned in the Maritza. Vukasin escaped from the field of\r\nbattle only to be killed by his servant for the gold chain he wore\r\naround his neck.[336]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Cernomen lost Macedonia to the Serbians. The three princes\r\nwere killed. Most of the Serbian adventurers who had been the companions\r\nof Stephen Dushan, and who had profited by his Macedonian conquests,\r\ndisappeared. The Osmanlis had no opposition in penetrating to the valley\r\nof the Vardar.\r\n\r\nThe monk Isaias of Serres has left a graphic contemporary picture of the\r\nOttoman invasion of Macedonia. ‘Like the birds of Heaven, the\r\nIshmaelites spread themselves over the land, and never ceased murdering\r\nthe inhabitants or carrying them off into slavery. The country was empty\r\nof men, of cattle, and of the fruits of the fields. There was no prince\r\nor leader: there was no redeemer or saviour among the people. All faded\r\naway before the fear of the Ishmaelites, and even the brave hearts of\r\nheroic men were transformed into weak hearts of women. Rightly were the\r\ndead envied by the living.’[337]\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Macedonia in 1371-2 was as rapid and decisive a campaign\r\nas the invasion of Thrace had been ten years before. Kavalla, Drama and\r\nSerres were occupied by Khaïreddin and Evrenos.[338] Drama and Serres\r\nwere colonized, their churches converted into mosques, and they soon\r\nbecame the residence of the owners of the timarets granted in eastern\r\nMacedonia. These two cities have always been the strongholds of the\r\nMohammedan element in Macedonia, and the residence of the great Moslem\r\nlandowners. The cities and villages in the valleys of the Mesta and the\r\nStruma acknowledged Murad as sovereign, and submitted without resistance\r\nto Ottoman laws and Ottoman taxation.[339] Where-ever it was safe to do\r\nso, Murad seized the lands, and appointed Ottoman governors. In\r\ndistricts where pacification would have proved a difficult task, he\r\nallowed Serbian chiefs to rule as his vassals.\r\n\r\nWith the same impetuosity that had carried them to the foothills of the\r\nRhodope Mountains after the capture of Adrianople, the Osmanlis crossed\r\nthe Vardar in 1372, and pushed their arms into Old Serbia, Albania,\r\nBosnia, and even to the mountains of Dalmatia, from which they could see\r\nthe Adriatic.[340] Other adventurous bands, eager to attract the\r\nattention, the commendation, and the rewards of Murad, followed the\r\nfootsteps of the Catalans, traversed Thessaly, and appeared in the\r\nplains of Attica.[341]\r\n\r\nMurad destroyed the Macedonian empire of Stephen Dushan without great\r\neffort. The Serbians remaining east of the Vardar, nobles and peasants,\r\nbecame Ottoman subjects. In upper Serbia, they rallied round one of\r\ntheir number, Lazar Gresljanovitch, whom they formally elected as\r\nsuccessor of the Serbian kings. But Lazar was so weak that he did not\r\ntake the title of emperor (_tzar_) or of king (_kral_), but called\r\nhimself merely prince (_knez_).[342] To secure the existence of his\r\nkingdom or principality, he sought peace with Murad, and, following the\r\nexample of the Byzantine and Bulgarian rulers, became vassal and\r\ntributary of the Ottoman emir.[343]\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year 1372, it was recognized that the Osmanlis had\r\ncome into the Balkans to stay. The conquest of Macedonia east of the\r\nVardar, following so closely upon the subjugation of southern Bulgaria\r\nand the completion of the Thracian conquest, gave to Murad a\r\npreponderant position in the Balkan peninsula. The Byzantine emperor and\r\nthe Bulgarian and Serbian princes were his tributaries. Wallachia,\r\nBosnia, Albania, Epirus, Thessaly, Attica and the Peloponnesus were now\r\non the confines of the Ottoman Empire, and menaced by Ottoman invasion.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Murad was credited with having the intention of invading\r\nHungary. It was reported that he had made an alliance with the Tartars\r\nof Russia to attack Hungary. The Tartars were to cross the Carpathians\r\nby way of Moldavia into Transylvania, while Murad was to work his way up\r\nthe valley of the Danube.[344] Murad may have dreamed of such a project,\r\njust as he had thought of making a supreme effort to enter\r\nConstantinople after his first Thracian campaign. But, if he did, he was\r\ndeterred by the same well-grounded fear of moving too fast. Ten years\r\nbefore he had refrained from committing a fatal error. He would continue\r\nto make haste slowly. The early Osmanlis were not raiders. They were\r\nempire-builders. They succeeded because they never forgot that their\r\ngreatest problem was that of assimilation. When they extended their\r\nconquests beyond the area of possible assimilation, the period of decay\r\nautomatically commenced.\r\n\r\nThe decade following the Macedonian campaign of 1371-2 was spent in\r\nottomanizing southern Bulgaria and eastern Macedonia, in completing the\r\nassimilation of Thrace, in reorganizing the army, and in a rearrangement\r\nof the system of distributing the timarets or military fiefs. Royal\r\ndomains were created, and lands were set aside for the support of the\r\nmosques and other religious institutions in the form of inalienable\r\nendowments (_vakufs_).\r\n\r\nThe only move of Murad against the Hungarians was to send five thousand\r\narchers, upon the request of the Senate, to help the Venetians in their\r\nwar against Louis.[345]\r\n\r\nAfter the Macedonian campaign, Murad turned his attention once more to\r\nByzantium. John, when he returned from his unsuccessful trip to Rome,\r\nplacated Murad by sending his third son, Theodore, to serve in the\r\nOttoman army. In 1373, John, passing over Andronicus, raised Manuel to\r\nthe imperial purple as co-emperor. The disloyalty of his eldest son in\r\nthe question of the emperor’s ransom from his Venetian creditors made it\r\nnatural that John should have selected Manuel to rule with him.\r\n\r\nJohn was not wrong in his estimate of the character of Andronicus. The\r\ndisappointed prince entered into a conspiracy with Saoudji, son of\r\nMurad, who had been entrusted with the command of the Thracian army\r\nwhile his father was occupied in Anatolia. John and Manuel, according to\r\nsome accounts, were also in the field with Murad. So the moment was\r\npropitious. The two sons raised the standard of revolt against their\r\nfathers.[346] Murad, who hated his own son and feared him, crossed\r\nimmediately into Thrace. The army which was supporting the cause of the\r\nyoung princes abandoned them, and the rebels fled to shut themselves up\r\nin Demotika.[347]\r\n\r\nFaced with starvation, the inhabitants of Demotika opened the gates of\r\ntheir city to Murad. He exacted a most atrocious vengeance. The garrison\r\nwere bound hand and foot and thrown into the river. The young Osmanlis\r\nand Greeks who had been led astray by the princes, were put to death.\r\nWherever possible Murad compelled fathers to act as executioners of\r\ntheir sons. He set the example by tearing out Saoudji’s eyes, and then\r\ncutting off his head.[348]\r\n\r\nIt has been generally written that Murad intended that the same\r\npunishment should be meted out to Andronicus. For the sake of\r\nappearances, he did order John Palaeologos to have his son’s eyes put\r\nout. But there was no order for execution. John Palaeologos consented to\r\nthe blinding of Andronicus and of his grandson and namesake, who was\r\nonly five years old.[349] The operation was not successfully performed.\r\nBoth Andronicus and his son, even if temporarily blinded, recovered\r\ntheir eyesight. Some have explained this by stating that they were\r\nhealed by a Genoese physician.[350] There is recorded a beautiful story\r\nthat Andronicus owed the restoration of his sight to the empress, his\r\nmother, who visited him daily in the tower of Anemas and was prodigal in\r\nher efforts to heal him. He was in despair for some months, until one\r\nday he saw a lizard climbing on a wall.[351]\r\n\r\nIf Murad had really desired the death or total blindness of Andronicus,\r\nhe could easily have secured this result. While punishing his own son,\r\nhowever, he saw to it that Andronicus escaped the consequences of the\r\nsame crime. Here we have a revelation of the far-sightedness and\r\ncold-bloodedness of Murad. He killed his own son, because he feared his\r\nrivalry. He spared the son of John Palaeologos in order to perpetuate\r\nthe rivalry between the emperor and his son. To have killed or\r\nincapacitated Andronicus would have been from his view-point an act of\r\nfolly rather than of justice; for Andronicus, brilliant, adventurous,\r\nmagnetic, was at the same time a worthy exemplar of the name he bore, a\r\nname that stood for the acme of unscrupulous conduct and contempt for\r\nties of blood. Murad had only to wait, and history would repeat itself.\r\nInternal dissensions in the family of the Palaeologi had made the\r\nfortunes of Orkhan. Murad had no intention of getting rid of Andronicus,\r\nin whom he saw the means of still further enmeshing the Byzantine\r\nemperors.[352]\r\n\r\nThe Byzantine historians record for the year 1374 another event, which\r\nillustrates the power of Murad over John Palaeologos. Manuel, who had\r\nresumed the government of Salonika, tried to induce the inhabitants of\r\nSerres to recover their liberty by massacring the Ottoman garrison and\r\nthe Ottoman colonists. Serres, in spite of its prominent place in recent\r\nSerbian history, was regarded by the Byzantines (as it still is by the\r\nGreeks of to-day) as a city of their compatriots. We have no means of\r\nestablishing the grounds upon which Manuel believed it possible to\r\nrestore the Byzantine authority in the country between the Struma and\r\nthe Vardar. The sequel indicates that it was a wild and unfounded hope\r\nof a desperate man, and shows how thoroughly in two years the Osmanlis\r\nhad become masters of the situation in Macedonia.\r\n\r\nMurad, warned in time of the project, sent Khaïreddin pasha with a large\r\narmy to Serres. The Greeks implicated in the plot were promptly\r\nexecuted, and Khaïreddin moved against Salonika. At the approach of the\r\narmy, Manuel fled by sea to Constantinople. John Palaeologos was so\r\nfrightened that he did not dare to receive in the imperial city the\r\nbeloved son whom he had raised to the dignity of co-emperorship. Manuel\r\nthen went to Lesbos, whose Genoese lord was his uncle by marriage. But\r\nthe fear of Murad had reached the Aegaean Sea. The fugitive was turned\r\naway. Staking all upon the issue, Manuel went to Brusa and threw himself\r\nat Murad’s feet. The time was not yet ripe to destroy the Palaeologi.\r\nMurad pardoned Manuel, and sent him back to Constantinople. It was only\r\nafter Manuel had presented a letter from Murad, confirming the fact that\r\nforgiveness had been granted, that the emperor of Byzantium dared to\r\nreceive his son and heir within the walls of Constantinople.[353]\r\n\r\nPressed by the Venetians, John made in 1375 the mistake of giving them,\r\nin exchange for three thousand ducats and the jewels which had been\r\npledged for his debts after the visit to Rome, the island of\r\nTenedos.[354] The strategic importance of Tenedos was so vital that the\r\nGenoese could not allow this island to fall into the hands of their\r\nrivals. It is an axiom as old as history that who holds Tenedos controls\r\nthe entrance and exit to the Dardanelles. Until the Black Sea dries up\r\nand the wheat-fields of Russia fail to yield, there will be a ‘question\r\nof the Straits’.\r\n\r\nThe news of this grant to Venice meant but one thing to the Genoese.\r\nThere was feverish activity at Genoa. A fleet was manned, ostensibly for\r\nthe purpose of maintaining the Levant colonies against the Turks.[355]\r\nPope Gregory XI allowed the archbishop of Genoa to raise enormous sums\r\nby questionable means for equipping and increasing the fleet.[356]\r\nInstead of using this fleet to free the Aegaean and the Black Sea from\r\nthe ever-increasing Turkish pirates, or to attack the Osmanlis, the\r\nGenoese admiral sailed to Constantinople. Aided by the Genoese of Galata\r\nand by Bayezid, Andronicus had escaped from the tower of Anemas. When\r\nthe fleet arrived from Genoa, he gave to its admiral a golden bull,\r\nawarding Tenedos to Genoa.[357] To Murad he offered his sister in\r\nexchange for help.[358] The old story was repeated. After a month’s\r\nsiege, Andronicus, by the aid of his Ottoman and Genoese supporters,\r\nentered Constantinople. His father and his two brothers, Manuel and\r\nTheodore, were imprisoned in the Tower of Anemas, where he and his son\r\nhad been shut up for two years.[359] The foresight of Murad in regard to\r\nAndronicus was justified.\r\n\r\nWhile Andronicus was besieging Constantinople, John V managed to send\r\nword to the inhabitants of Tenedos to resist the Genoese and give\r\nthemselves to the Venetians. If this were not possible, they were to\r\nabandon the island to the Turks rather than allow the Genoese to occupy\r\nit.[360]\r\n\r\nAfter a year’s imprisonment, the emperor, through the wife of his\r\njailer, succeeded in perfecting with Venetians residing in\r\nConstantinople a plan of escape. But its execution was deferred when\r\nJohn discovered that his sons, who were confined to separate rooms,\r\ncould not be included in the rescue. Later, the efforts of the Venetians\r\nwere renewed upon the solemn promise that Tenedos should revert to\r\nVenice. The plot was discovered. The Venetians, availing themselves of\r\nthe lucky chance that a Venetian fleet had just arrived in the Golden\r\nHorn from the Black Sea, fled from Constantinople, abandoning John\r\nPalaeologos to his fate.[361] Andronicus IV was solemnly crowned in St.\r\nSophia sole emperor of Byzantium.\r\n\r\nAfter two more years of imprisonment,[362] John and his sons succeeded\r\nin escaping in June 1379. They got across the Bosphorus, and took refuge\r\nwith Bayezid, who was again watching the course of events at Scutari.\r\nMurad, still playing the game of pitting father against son, drove a\r\nhard bargain. Andronicus must be pardoned once more, and given the\r\ngovernment of several cities, probably including Salonika.[363] John and\r\nManuel, as a price for freedom and restoration to the imperial throne,\r\nagreed to pay an annual tribute of thirty thousand pieces of gold,\r\nfurnish a contingent of twelve thousand soldiers to the Ottoman army,\r\nand surrender to the Osmanlis Philadelphia, the last Byzantine\r\npossession in Asia.[364] When the Philadelphians refused to assent to\r\nthis shameful transaction, John and Manuel joined the Ottoman army and\r\nfought against their last Christian subjects in Asia to force upon them\r\nthe Moslem yoke.[365]\r\n\r\nThus did Murad hold to the lips of John Palaeologos the cup of\r\nhumiliation, nay, more, of degradation, until he drained the last bitter\r\ndregs. We do not need to pass judgement upon John and Manuel. It is\r\nsufficient to say that they drank and did not die!\r\n\r\nThe question of Tenedos brought Venice and Genoa into their most bitter\r\nconflict of the century. The Visconti of Milan were allied to the\r\nVenetians, while the Hungarians attacked them by land.[366] After\r\ninitial successes, the great Venetian admiral Pisani was beaten\r\ndecisively in 1379. The Genoese captured Chioggia, and held Venice at\r\nbay in her own lagoons. It was the timely arrival of Charles Zeno and\r\nthe fleet from the Levant that saved the Adriatic republic.[367] In\r\n1381, peace was made through the intermediary of Count Amadeo of Savoy,\r\non condition that the Senate surrendered Tenedos to Amadeo, who\r\nguaranteed to demolish the fortress within two years. It was also a\r\nstipulation of the treaty of Turin that Andronicus IV be recognized as\r\nheir to John V.[368] Did the influence of Murad reach as far as the\r\npeace negotiations in the capital of far-off Savoy? The Count of Savoy\r\nfulfilled his promise. In 1383, the fortifications of Tenedos were\r\nrased, and the inhabitants of the island removed to Crete and\r\nNegropont.[369]\r\n\r\nThe war over Tenedos had kept open the Straits, but it helped Murad in\r\nan inestimable degree to tighten the grip of the Osmanlis upon Thrace\r\nand Macedonia. The Italian republics thought no more of driving the\r\nOsmanlis out of Europe. From now on until they themselves see their\r\npossessions wrested from them and their commerce in the Levant ruined by\r\nthe successors of Murad, the Venetians and Genoese are suitors for\r\nfavours at the door of the tent of the Moslem conqueror.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nWhile the struggle between the Palaeologi and the Venetian war with\r\nGenoa and Hungary were strengthening Murad’s position in Europe, he\r\nbegan to turn his attention, for the first time since the expedition\r\nagainst Angora at the beginning of his reign, to the expansion of\r\nOttoman authority in Asia Minor. The antipathy of the South Slavs for\r\nthe Hungarians, the anarchy among the Serbians, the lack of leadership\r\namong the Bulgarians, and the civil strife in the Byzantine imperial\r\nfamily made the period from 1376 to 1381 peculiarly appropriate for\r\ninitiating a movement against the emirates on the confines of his own\r\nstate. Murad felt for the moment secure in Macedonia and Thrace. The\r\ninhabitants of the conquered countries could do nothing. There were no\r\nprospects of a crusade. Through the rapid increase of the Ottoman race\r\nduring the first fifteen years in Europe, and through the vassalage of\r\nthe Christian princes, which compelled them to furnish contingents for\r\nwar, Murad now had money and soldiers to confront his nearer Anatolian\r\nrivals.\r\n\r\nIn 1360, after the capture of Angora and the defeat of the Galatian\r\nvillage chiefs,[370] Murad did not lose his head. He was wise enough to\r\nfear an attack on Kermian. Now he had only to threaten, thanks to the\r\nprestige and actual power he had gained in Europe. The emir of Kermian\r\nwas too prudent to risk a war with the son of the rival whom he had\r\ndespised. In order to preserve his independence and at the same time his\r\npride, he agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Bayezid. The\r\nterritories which Murad coveted, and was ready to try to take by force,\r\nwent with her as her marriage portion. It was a munificent dot. The\r\nwestern and northern part of Kermian became Ottoman. The most important\r\ncity in the new territory was Kutayia, the ancient Cotýaeum, a strategic\r\npoint of great value. Its remarkable citadel of countless towers is\r\nstill standing.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of the emir of Kermian’s daughter to Bayezid was celebrated\r\nat Brusa with much splendour. For the first time we hear of the Osmanlis\r\ninterested in matters of court and luxury. The simple warriors, who had\r\nknown nothing but the village council and the camp fire, were becoming\r\naccustomed to the more formal and more complex life of the Greek cities.\r\nWith every victory and every extension of sovereignty, with every\r\naddition to the army and to the body of civilian officials, the distance\r\nbetween the sovereign and his people was widened. The ceremonial evolved\r\nby the Ottoman court was that of Byzantium; the customs of the higher\r\nclasses, who were just beginning to realize their self-made rank, were\r\nByzantine, even to the veiling of women.[371] The Osmanlis had not yet\r\ncome into touch with the Arabs or Egyptians. If they received anything\r\nfrom the Persians, it was by way of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman occupation of Kutayia was a grave blow to the security of\r\nthe emirates of Tekke and Hamid. The emir of Hamid saw the hopelessness\r\nof a struggle. He compounded with his pride by ‘selling’ to Murad, in\r\n1377, the territory between Tekke, Kermian, and Karamania. Several\r\ncities, including Sparta and Kara-Agatch, became Ottoman, but most\r\nimportant of all, Ak Sheïr, which brought the Osmanlis to the frontier\r\nof Karamania.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of this important territory extended the Ottoman state\r\nsouth to the border of Tekke. In 1378, Murad made his only conquest by\r\narms from a rival emir in Asia. He invaded Tekke, and annexed the\r\ndistricts at the south and south-west of the lake region. But he did not\r\ncross the mountains to the Mediterranean, so the emir of Tekke still\r\nretained Adalia, and Alaya was undisturbed.\r\n\r\nFor three years Murad devoted his energies to the pacification and\r\nassimilation of these slices of Kermian, Hamid and Tekke. But none of\r\nthe three principalities had been extinguished. And Sarukhan, Aïdin and\r\nMenteshe were untouched. There was still much to be accomplished in\r\nwestern Asia Minor. But Murad preferred to return to Adrianople. He\r\nwould increase his power and prestige in Europe, recruit his armies in\r\nthe Balkans, and then come once more into Anatolia.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTo assure to the Osmanlis their preponderant position in the Balkan\r\npeninsula, the possession of three cities was necessary. The capture of\r\nSofia meant the extension of Ottoman sovereignty over Bulgaria to the\r\nDanube. Nish was the key to Serbia. Monastir was indispensable, if the\r\nOsmanlis intended to be more than raiders west of the Vardar.\r\n\r\nIn 1380, Murad ordered the advance to the Vardar. Istip was captured,\r\nand colonized in the same thorough way as had been done at Drama and\r\nSerres. A large army under Timurtash crossed the Vardar, took Monastir\r\nby assault through the marshes, and pushed north to Prilep.[372]\r\nMonastir and Prilep became frontier fortresses of the empire. The\r\nconquest of Macedonia was now complete. These cities were excellent\r\nbases of operation against the Albanians to the west and the Epirotes to\r\nthe south-west.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Murad, the Osmanlis did not attempt a subjugation\r\nof Albania and Epirus. They were, however, invited into these countries\r\nby native princes.\r\n\r\nThomas, despot of Janina, used Ottoman mercenaries against the Souliotes\r\nin 1382.[373] Two years later, after the assassination of Thomas, the\r\nAlbanians besieged Janina with Ottoman aid.[374] The civil war that\r\narose around the widow of Thomas prepared the way for the Osmanlis to\r\nextend their rule to the Gulf of Arta.\r\n\r\nIn 1385, Khaïreddin pasha, who had occupied Okrida, the ancient\r\necclesiastical seat of the Bulgarians, a day’s journey west of Monastir,\r\nwas invited by Charles Thopia, lord of Durazzo, to aid him in his war\r\nagainst Balsa, the most powerful Frankish prince of Albania. Khaïreddin\r\nwas glad of the opportunity afforded by this overture. He crossed the\r\nmountains to Elbasan, and then turned southward to meet Balsa. The first\r\nbattle of the Osmanlis in Albania was fought in the salt-wastes of\r\nSavra, on the left bank of the river Devol. The Osmanlis faced fighting\r\nmen who were fully their equals in courage, in resourcefulness, in\r\nstrength, and in willingness to engage in a hand-to-hand struggle to\r\ndeath. The issue was long in doubt, and the victory costly. Balsa and\r\nhis ally and guest, Ivanitch, son of krai Vukasin, were killed.[375] The\r\nOsmanlis gained one important result from this battle. Albanian\r\nrenegades joined their army in great numbers.[376] From that day to this\r\nthe Albanian element in the Ottoman army, especially among its officers,\r\nhas been a source of strength which cannot be over-estimated.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if the Osmanlis withdrew from Albania, even temporarily,\r\nafter the battle of Savra; for in 1388 the princess of Valona (Avlona)\r\nwas so hard pressed by the Osmanlis that she put her domains under the\r\nprotection of Venice.[377]\r\n\r\nIn northern Albania, the invaders captured Croia and Scutari in 1386.\r\nScutari was given back by Murad in exchange for the addition of a member\r\nof the ruling family of Zenta to his harem. From Croia, also, the\r\nOsmanlis withdrew. Murad did not want to excite and alarm Venice at the\r\nmoment when Philippe de Mézières was preaching so vigorously and\r\nsuccessfully a new crusade.[378]\r\n\r\nThe plain in which four tributaries join the Isker is the very heart of\r\nthe Balkan peninsula, almost equidistant from the Adriatic, the Aegaean,\r\nand the Black Sea. Here the three great ranges of the West Balkan, the\r\nCentral Balkan, and the Rhodope Mountains converge, and three important\r\nrivers find their source. The Struma flows south through Macedonia, the\r\nIsker north-east through a canyon of the Balkans into the Danube, and\r\nthe Nisava north-west into the Morava. In the middle of the southern\r\nborder of this plain, under the shadow of a lofty mountain, lies Sofia.\r\n\r\nThe way to Sofia had been opened by the battle of Samakov. But its\r\noccupation was not the next logical step to Murad until the valleys of\r\nthe Vardar and the Struma had been conquered. The occupation of Sofia\r\nwas a temptation splendidly resisted in 1371. In 1381 it was a\r\nnecessity. For it opened the path to trans-Balkan Bulgaria and to\r\nSerbia, and Murad was now ready to extend his conquest to the Danube by\r\nway of the Isker and the Morava.\r\n\r\nThe Slavic chronicles are silent concerning the fall of Sofia. From the\r\nlate Ottoman accounts, it would seem that the city was intermittently\r\nbesieged for several years. Then a young Osmanli, who had entered the\r\ncity as refugee, and had become the confidant and falconer of its\r\ncommandant, betrayed him. He urged his master in a chase some distance\r\nin front of his followers, and fell upon him in a mountain gorge. The\r\ncommandant was bound to his horse, and taken a prisoner to Ishtiman.\r\nIndje Balaban, son of the general of Osman who had besieged Brusa for\r\nten years, brought his army from Philippopolis, and paraded the\r\ncommandant, garrotted, under the walls of Sofia. The Bulgarians,\r\ndiscouraged and despairing of aid, surrendered.[379] We can be certain\r\nneither of the name of the Bulgarian commandant nor of the date of the\r\nsurrender. But it was probably in 1385.[380] Bulgaria up to the main\r\nBalkan range was now Ottoman territory.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Nish, in the summer of 1386, marked the next extension of\r\nMurad’s empire.[381] The Serbians did not yield without a struggle, as\r\nthe Bulgarians had done. Nish was taken by assault. Lazar secured peace\r\nonly by increasing the amount of his tribute and adding one thousand\r\ncavaliers to his contingent in the Ottoman army.[382]\r\n\r\nNish was sixteen days by carriage from Constantinople. Murad was now\r\nmaster of four-fifths of the great Roman highway from Belgrade to the\r\nBosphorus; for Tchorlu, Demotika, Adrianople, Philippopolis, Ishtiman,\r\nSofia, and Nish were in his hands. Nish was also the point where the\r\nroad from Belgrade to Salonika turned southward. Practically all but the\r\nlast day’s journey of the road across the Balkan peninsula from\r\nConstantinople to Durazzo on the Adriatic was Ottoman territory. In Asia\r\nMinor, Murad held the ancient highway from Constantinople to Trebizond\r\nas far as Angora, and the road which the pilgrims and Crusaders,\r\nJerusalem-bent, had travelled as far as Ak Sheïr. From Angora to Nish\r\ntook twenty-five days; from Constantinople to Durazzo seventeen\r\ndays.[383] Twenty-five years before, when Murad came to the\r\nchieftainship of the Osmanlis, the Ottoman dominions could have been\r\ntraversed in any direction in three days.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nThe treaty concluded between the Byzantines and Genoese in 1386 affords\r\na striking illustration of Murad’s power after the Nish campaign. This\r\ntreaty, whose text has been preserved, was signed by John and Andronicus\r\nPalaeologos, the podesta of Pera, and the Genoese ambassador. John\r\nPalaeologos bound himself to live in peace with his son Andronicus, and\r\nto move his army against all the enemies of Genoa ‘except Morat bey and\r\nhis Turks’. The Genoese in turn promised to defend Constantinople\r\n‘against all enemies of whatever nationality except the said Morat bey\r\nand his Turks, who acted according to the will of the said Morat bey’!\r\nThroughout the treaty, Murad is carefully excepted on both sides.[384]\r\n\r\nGenoa made a formal treaty with Murad in 1385. Favours were granted to\r\nthe Osmanlis who did business in Pera, in return for liberty to Genoese\r\nmerchants to reside and conduct business in the states of Murad. The\r\ntreaty recalls the friendship of the Genoese for Orkhan, and speaks of\r\nMurad as ‘the magnificent and powerful lord of lords, Moratibei, grand\r\nadmiral[385] and lord of the admirals of Turchie’.[386] But in the very\r\nnext year Genoa secretly joined an offensive league with Cyprus, Scio\r\n(Chios) and Mytilene ‘against that Turk, son of unrighteousness and\r\nevil, and also of the Holy Cross Morat bey, and his sect, who are\r\nattempting so grievously to attack the Christian race’.[387]\r\n\r\nIn the first year of Murad’s reign, the Venetian energy had become so\r\nsapped by prosperity and luxury that the Senate passed a sumptuary\r\nlaw.[388] The recent triumph over Genoa had given them a belief in\r\ntheir invincibility. Their self-sufficiency, and the growing\r\ndisinclination to lay aside the pen and ledger for the sword and shield,\r\nwere alarming symptoms of decay. The lesson of the Genoese at Chioggia\r\nwas needed to teach the Venetians that the struggle for existence never\r\nceases.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their vital interest in the development of the Levant, and\r\nthe power that their wealth gave them in a generation when fighting\r\nstrength could be purchased so easily, Venice made no effort to oppose\r\nthe progress of Ottoman conquest. On the contrary, in 1368, long before\r\nan invasion of Albania was imminent, the Senate negotiated with the\r\nOsmanlis for the reddition of Scutari. This project was again taken up\r\nin 1384, in a tentative way, during negotiations to fix the\r\ncustoms-duties of Venetian merchant-vessels.[389] Following the example\r\nof Ragusa and Genoa, Venice concluded, in 1388, a commercial treaty with\r\nMurad.[390]\r\n\r\nThe traffic of the Italian republics with the Moslems had been denounced\r\nby Gregory X in 1272, by Boniface VIII in 1299, by Urban V in 1366, and\r\nby Gregory XI in 1372.[391] In vain the popes exhorted; in vain they\r\nthreatened interdict and excommunication; in vain they held up to\r\nexecration the abominable slave traffic. Trade interests alone decided\r\nthe policies of the maritime cities. Their citizens never hesitated to\r\ncut each other’s throats for the opportunity of selling goods. To them\r\nthe crusades were a purely commercial proposition. More than once the\r\narchives of Venice reveal the approval of the Senate upon the action of\r\nmerchants who warned Moslem princes of the crusaders’ intentions.\r\nGuillaume d’Adam declared with reason that the Saracens maintained their\r\nsupremacy in the Holy Land and Egypt through the support of the traders,\r\nwho furnished them with Christian slaves to keep up their armies.[392]\r\nGenoa passed laws in 1315 and in 1340 against the slave traffic of the\r\nBlack Sea,[393] but these laws were never enforced.[394]\r\n\r\nVenice and Genoa turned a deaf ear to papal remonstrances and to papal\r\nappeals for aid in crusades against the Osmanlis. For the sake of\r\npreserving their commerce, they flattered Murad, and aided him,\r\nindirectly at least, to subjugate the Christians of the Levant. Their\r\nchildren of the third and fourth generation paid to the descendants of\r\nMurad the penalty of their greed. They lost their commerce in trying to\r\nsave it.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1387 that Murad believed himself strong enough to\r\nmeasure arms with Karamania. His son-in-law, Alaeddin, whose name is\r\nreminiscent of the earlier glory of Konia, was emir of the most powerful\r\nstate in Anatolia. The Ottoman historians have represented Alaeddin’s\r\nresistance of the encroachment of the Osmanlis, and his defiance of\r\nMurad, as rebellion, and have been blindly followed in this by most of\r\nthe European historians. Such a conception of the conflict between the\r\nOsmanlis and the Karamanlis is far from the truth. There is no record of\r\nwhen and how Karamania had become subject to Murad. In fact, up to 1387,\r\nMurad had not yet extended his sovereignty over all of Tekke and Hamid,\r\nthe states which bordered Karamania on the west.\r\n\r\nNeither Alaeddin himself nor his predecessors had ever acknowledged the\r\nsuzerainty of the house of Osman. From the standpoint of the\r\nKaramanians, the Ottoman emir was not even _primus inter pares_ of the\r\nTurkish princes in Anatolia. Osman had probably not been known by name\r\nto the founder of the house of Karaman. Orkhan never came into direct\r\ncontact with the Karamanlis. Murad, at the beginning of his reign, had\r\nindirectly gained an advantage over the emir of Karaman in the\r\nsuccessful issue of his expedition against the Phrygian chiefs and the\r\ncapture of Angora. Fifteen years later his accessions of territory in\r\nKermian, Hamid, and Tekke brought him into rivalry with Alaeddin. But it\r\nwas the prestige and power gained by Murad in European conquests that\r\nmade him a rival to be reckoned with. The first acknowledgement of his\r\ngrowing strength was the marriage alliance between the houses of these\r\ntwo emirs. Alaeddin, however, did not by this marriage constitute\r\nhimself a vassal of his father-in-law. The letters of Murad to Alaeddin\r\nin the collection of Feridun are couched in terms of equality.\r\n\r\nMurad rallied his army at Kutayia for the first great Ottoman campaign\r\nin Asia. He could not muster enough Osmanlis to undertake so formidable\r\na feat as the invasion of Karamania, and had to rely upon large\r\ncontingents of Greeks and Serbians, who were sent to him, in accordance\r\nwith their conventions, by his vassals, the emperor John and the kral\r\nLazar.[395] The Balkan soldiers, under the command of Bayezid, formed\r\nthe left wing of the Ottoman army.\r\n\r\nBattle was joined in the great plain before Konia, which has so often\r\nbeen the scene of Ottoman triumphs and reverses. The Ottoman historians\r\ndeclare that Alaeddin was defeated, largely through the bravery of\r\nTimurtash, and represent the battle of Konia as a decisive victory,\r\nwhich ‘put down the rebellion’. According to them, Alaeddin ‘sued for\r\npeace’. Murad ‘forgave’ him, because he was moved by the tearful\r\npleadings of his daughter, Alaeddin’s wife.[396]\r\n\r\nBut the net result of the costly expedition was the reconciliation of\r\nthe two emirs. The only result recorded by the Ottoman historians is\r\nthat Alaeddin kissed Murad’s hands! Murad withdrew to Kutayia without\r\nannexing any portion of the Karamanian emirate, without booty, and\r\nwithout promise either of tribute or military contingents for the\r\nEuropean wars. Had Murad actually accomplished more than merely holding\r\nhis own in the battle of Konia, the campaign would not have ended so\r\nprofitlessly. Granting the Ottoman victory, Murad’s conduct after the\r\nbattle is inconsistent with his whole life and character. We are\r\ncompelled to discard the story of a decisive victory. It must be that\r\nMurad, who had been able to reduce to vassalage the Byzantines, the\r\nBulgarians, and the Serbians, found himself unable, even with the help\r\nof his European allies, to break the power of this rival Anatolian emir.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nDuring the Karamanian campaign, Murad adopted the policy of treating\r\nnon-combatants in a friendly fashion. Strict orders were given to\r\nrefrain from violence and looting. Murad hoped to win the Karamanlis by\r\nkindness, and to pave the way for a later assimilation. It was the first\r\ncampaign undertaken against fellow Moslems. The Serbian contingent, who\r\ncared nothing for the success of this policy, and who claimed that they\r\nhad been promised booty in return for their services, did not obey the\r\norder. A number of them were summarily executed.[397]\r\n\r\nWhen the survivors returned to their homes in the spring of 1388, they\r\ncomplained bitterly of the way they had been treated, and declared that\r\nservice in the Ottoman army, for the Christian all risk and no gain, was\r\nnothing less than a slavery leading to death. This discontent gave Lazar\r\nthe opportunity for which he had long been looking. He decided to profit\r\nby the resentment of the Serbians against Murad,[398] and make a supreme\r\neffort to free Serbia from the menace of the Ottoman yoke, which had\r\ngrown very real since the capture of Nish.\r\n\r\nThe Slavs of upper Serbia and of Bosnia realized the imminence of an\r\nOttoman invasion, and they were now ready--or at least they appeared to\r\nbe ready--to rally around Lazar. Up to this time the Serbians had never\r\nrecognized Lazar as the leader of the race.\r\n\r\nThe pan-Serbian alliance was made possible by the adhesion of Tvrtko,\r\nkral of Bosnia. He had come into prominence after the battle of Cernomen\r\nas a supporter of Lazar against the sons of Vukasin and other Serbian\r\nchieftains who were dissatisfied with the election of Lazar. But in\r\nreturn for his aid, he got under his control a large part of upper\r\nSerbia, including Milesevo, which was the burial-place of St. Sava,\r\napostle to the Serbians. In 1376, he crowned himself ‘king of Bosnia and\r\nSerbia’ on the tomb of St. Sava, placing upon his head the two crowns,\r\nand changing his name to Stephen. Neither Louis of Hungary nor Lazar was\r\nconsulted by Tvrtko, and he took no measures to secure their assent to\r\nhis pretensions. After his coronation, he conquered Cattaro, and fought\r\nsuccessfully with Balza of Albania.[399]\r\n\r\nIn 1383 Tvrtko had become so powerful on the Dalmatian coast that the\r\nSenate recognized him as ‘king of Serbia, Bosnia and the Riviera’, and\r\nbestowed upon him the privilege of Venetian citizenship.[400] It was\r\nevidently the intention of Venice to favour Tvrtko as an opponent to\r\nLouis of Hungary, who had himself taken in 1382 the title of ‘king of\r\nSerbia, Dalmatia and Bulgaria’.[401] Venice lost her grip upon or\r\ninterest in the east coast of the Adriatic for a few years immediately\r\nfollowing the treaty of Turin. We have already seen how in 1384 the\r\nSenate professed a willingness to treat with the Osmanlis on the basis\r\nof giving up Scutari. In 1385 they became indifferent to currying\r\nfurther the favour of Tvrtko, and sent an embassy to press him for the\r\npayment of money due to Venice.[402] Tvrtko continued to consolidate his\r\nposition on the Dalmatian coast, until the capture of Nish influenced\r\nhim to aid Lazar against the Osmanlis.\r\n\r\nIt was not a moment too soon. An Ottoman army had already crossed the\r\nVardar and was marching forward for the invasion of Bosnia. Thirty\r\nthousand Serbians and Bosnians under the command of Tvrtko and Lazar met\r\nthe invading army at Plochnik, in the valley of the Toplika. Of twenty\r\nthousand Osmanlis scarcely one-fifth escaped death or captivity.[403]\r\nThe Bosnians successfully opposed two other Ottoman armies at Rudnik and\r\nBiletchia.[404]\r\n\r\nA delirium of joy spread through the Slavic population of the Balkans at\r\nthe news of the battle of Plochnik. The uninterrupted chain of thirty\r\nyears of Ottoman victories had been broken. The slavery and horror of\r\nmilitary service with the Osmanlis, price of their vassalage, so vividly\r\ndepicted by the survivors of the Karamanian campaign, had made the Slavs\r\ndesperate. This victory, following closely upon the moral revolt against\r\nthe Osmanlis, gave them hope. The South Slavs are like children in the\r\nextremes of their emotions. Tears to laughter--laughter to tears: easily\r\ndespairing, as easily hopeful, and from as little cause. The slightest\r\nreverse brings distrust in their ability to cope with forces that have\r\nonce successfully opposed them. Slight success brings overwhelming\r\nconfidence, and leads to colossal mistakes of judgement. With this trait\r\nof character is coupled an intuitive distrust of one’s neighbour, of the\r\ndisinterestedness of his motives, and an intuitive resentment of ‘the\r\nother fellow’ doing something better than you do it. This makes\r\nimpossible solidarity and _esprit de corps_. The South Slavic character\r\nexplains the series of events which brought the Serbians to their final\r\nand irretrievable disaster.\r\n\r\nAround Lazar the Serbian nobles rallied as they had never rallied\r\nbefore. Kral Tvrtko of Bosnia, George Kastriota of Albania, and the\r\nminor princes of Albania and Serbia joined in an alliance against the\r\nOsmanlis. The two remaining successors of Alexander of Bulgaria, Sisman\r\nand Ivanko, son of Dobrotich, threw off their allegiance to Murad, and\r\npromised contingents for the common struggle. The prince of Wallachia\r\nassured Lazar of the co-operation of the Rumanians.\r\n\r\nVenice, fearing lest Murad fall upon the Peloponnesus to seek vengeance\r\nfor the defeat of Plochnik, tried to form a league of all the Greek and\r\nFrankish lords in the Morea and central Greece.[405] As far as one can\r\njudge from the records, the effort of Venice was an intention rather\r\nthan an action. It did not get beyond the paper stage. The Senate gave\r\nto the Slavic alliance no encouragement more substantial than words. On\r\nthe other hand, some of the border nobles of the Hungarian banats, of\r\ntheir own volition, informed Lazar of their intention to co-operate in\r\nan offensive movement against the Osmanlis.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nMurad did not set his army in motion against the Serbians immediately\r\nafter the disaster at Plochnik. There was none of that feverish haste\r\nwhich had characterized his movements when he received the news of the\r\nSerbian and Hungarian crusade in 1363. For while the victory had aroused\r\nin the Balkan Christians a determination that they must drive the\r\nOsmanlis out of Europe, and a feeling that they could accomplish this\r\nend, its immediate result had been merely to repel the projected Ottoman\r\ninvasion of Bosnia. Ali pasha disposed of sufficient forces to hold the\r\nconquests that had already been made. Murad had come to know the people\r\nwith whom he was dealing. It was not so much to recruit his own army as\r\nto give the allies time to fall out with each other that Murad remained\r\nin Asia during the early months of 1388. To strike in the first flush of\r\nenthusiasm and buoyant hope would have brought him face to face with a\r\nunited enemy. If he waited, he knew from past experience with the Balkan\r\nprinces that the poison of jealousy would permeate the ranks of his\r\nostensibly united enemies. The Osmanlis never made a mistake of\r\njudgement in dealing with Balkan alliances until the autumn of 1912.\r\n\r\nFar from planning an offensive movement against the Serbians, Murad\r\nallowed Evrenos of Yanitza to lead a band of Ottoman mercenaries into\r\nthe Morea, at the invitation of Theodore Palaeologos, to support the\r\nauthority of the Byzantine Empire against the Frankish barons.[406] At\r\nthe same time he ordered Ali pasha to cross the Balkans into northern\r\nBulgaria.\r\n\r\nAli pasha started from Adrianople in the spring of 1388 with thirty\r\nthousand men to complete the conquest of Bulgaria. He crossed the\r\nBalkans by the pass north of Aïtos, which has ever since been called by\r\nthe Osmanlis Nadir Derbend from the neighbouring town of Nadirkeuy.[407]\r\nProvadia was taken by surprise in the night. Shuman and the villages\r\naround it were next conquered. After an unsuccessful attack upon Varna,\r\nthe Osmanlis retraced their steps through Provadia and Shuman, following\r\nthe line of the modern railway from Varna to Sofia. Tirnovo, the ancient\r\ncapital of Bulgaria, capitulated after a short struggle.\r\n\r\nSisman withdrew to the Danube through the valley of the Osma, and shut\r\nhimself up in the fortress of Nicopolis. Owing to the ease of\r\nprovisioning from the river side, it was impossible to starve him out.\r\nAli pasha was compelled to call upon Murad, who had just crossed over\r\nfrom Asia to Thrace. When Murad arrived before Nicopolis, Sisman sued\r\nfor peace. The conditions of Murad, that he pay the tribute due from the\r\nprevious year and allow an Ottoman garrison to occupy the fortress of\r\nDrster as gage of future good conduct, were gladly accepted.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Murad started southward than Sisman decided upon a final\r\ndesperate resistance. He refused to give up Drster. But he had forgotten\r\nthat Ali pasha was master of Shuman and the route to Varna. The Osmanlis\r\ntook Drster by storm. Many villages along the Danube between Rustuk and\r\nNicopolis fell into the hands of the Osmanlis. Ali pasha besieged Sisman\r\nfor a second time in Nicopolis. The revelation of his own weakness and\r\nof the strength of the Osmanlis was a crushing blow to Sisman. He\r\nsurrendered without conditions, and was taken, with his wife and\r\nchildren, to Murad’s camp. For reasons which the chroniclers do not\r\nindicate, Sisman was able to secure forgiveness and restoration to his\r\nformer position as vassal prince of Bulgaria. But the Osmanlis were now\r\ninstalled in north-central Bulgaria up to the Danube River. Shuman and\r\nNicopolis were Ottoman fortresses. Sisman had been rendered impotent to\r\ngive effective aid in the great alliance.[408]\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nNot all the Christians were loyal to the cause of Balkan freedom. In\r\ntheir conquest of the Balkan peninsula, it is remarkable that the\r\nOsmanlis never fought a battle without the help of allies of the faith\r\nand blood of those whom they were putting under the Moslem yoke. At the\r\nbeginning of this chapter, it has been shown that there is no historical\r\nbasis for the assertion that the Osmanlis conquered the Balkan states by\r\nthe use of the janissaries. But they did have Christian aid of a far\r\nmore powerful kind than the janissaries could have given them. The old\r\nfiction of the janissaries won for the Balkan people the sympathies of\r\nwestern Europe. The truth concerning the Christian aid which the Moslem\r\nconquerors received alienates rather than wins our sympathies.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the spring of 1389, Murad found himself ready to exact\r\nvengeance for Plochnik, and started from Bulgaria on his punitive\r\nexpedition, he was joined by Constantine of Kustendil, by the Serbian\r\nDragash, to whom he had given Serres as fief, and even by the sons of\r\nVukasin, the Serbian kral who had been killed in 1371 at Cernomen.[409]\r\nBalsa, prince of Zenta (upper Albania), postponed his march to join the\r\nallies, and entered secretly into correspondence with Murad through a\r\nSerbian nobleman in the Ottoman camp. Lazar knew of this treachery. He\r\nknew also that some of his own lieutenants had in all probability\r\narranged to sell him out to the Ottoman emir.[410]\r\n\r\nKossovapol, the plain of the blackbirds, is the name given to the valley\r\nof the Sitnika River (an upper tributary of the Morava) west of Pristina\r\nand south of Mitrovitza.[411] Here the decisive battle for Serbian\r\nindependence was fought on June 20, 1389.[412]\r\n\r\nSerbian chronicles state that Murad had enjoined upon his soldiers that\r\nthey should neither destroy nor sack the rich castles, villages, and\r\ncities of this region after the battle. Only four castles in all were\r\ndestroyed.[413] This command shows that Murad was confident of the\r\noutcome. He was fighting for the possession of this country, for the\r\nwealth and the prestige that it would give him. He had no intention of\r\ndestroying what he knew would be his to enjoy, nor did he desire to\r\nalienate the Serbian peasantry by unnecessary harshness. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, new Osmanlis rather than Ottoman subjects were the\r\n_desiderata_: they could be won only by kindness. Since the clemency of\r\nthe Osmanlis in dealing with the vanquished after the battle is frankly\r\nrecorded by the Serbians themselves, we cannot doubt that the wise and\r\nfar-seeing provisions of the conqueror were carried out.\r\n\r\nOf Kossova much has been written. It was the culminating event in that\r\nlegendary period of Serbian history which had begun fifty years before\r\nwith the exploits of Stephen Dushan. Lazar, Serbian chieftain with no\r\nlong line of royal ancestors behind him, with no great weight of\r\nauthority among his contemporaries, who began his career by craven\r\nsubmission to Murad and, after eighteen years in which no deed to his\r\ncredit is recorded, survived a crushing defeat to be executed on the\r\nfield of battle--this is the Charlemagne of Serbian poetry. On the\r\nanniversary of Kossova, the Serbians pray for his soul. As a saint, he\r\ngets many more candles at his shrine than his namesake of Bethany who\r\nwas raised from the dead. Such is legend in history. But what amazes one\r\nis the curious fact that the very folksongs that glorify Saint Lazar and\r\nlament Kossova reveal a frank and true picture of the events, and prove\r\nhow little warrant there is for the legend!\r\n\r\nThe Serbians despaired of their cause before the battle. The enormous\r\nnumber of the enemy dismayed them.[414] Rumours of treachery were\r\ncurrent in the allied camp. Their lack of courage, and the spirit of\r\ndistrust of each other’s good faith, is strikingly voiced in the oration\r\nof Lazar at a banquet the evening before the battle. He pleaded for a\r\ncourage and confidence which he himself did not feel. He openly accused\r\nhis son-in-law, Milosh Obravitch, of treason. Gloom and hopelessness had\r\nsettled over the Serbian camp, reflected from leaders to the common\r\nsoldiery. The battle was already lost. For victory is never won by those\r\nwho feel that they are going to lose.[415]\r\n\r\nThe battle was begun by the Osmanlis. Murad sent forward an advance\r\nguard of two thousand archers.[416] The allies responded with a charge\r\nin which the left wing of the Ottoman army was broken through by Lazar.\r\nFor a while the issue seemed in doubt. Bayezid held out against the\r\nimpetuosity of the Serbians, but the Osmanlis made no attempt to take\r\nthe offensive. At this critical juncture, when the battle was by no\r\nmeans decided, Vuk Brankovitch, another son-in-law of Lazar, quietly\r\nwithdrew from the field with twelve thousand men. This desertion, which\r\nhad probably been arranged for with Murad, so weakened the Serbians that\r\nthey broke and fled. Lazar and many of his leading noblemen, and\r\nthousands of his soldiers, were taken prisoners. It was not a fight to\r\nthe bitter end.[417]\r\n\r\nMurad won the battle of Kossova at the cost of his own life. From the\r\nstory which Clavijo de Gonzáles heard fifteen years later, one might\r\ninfer that Murad was killed in the course of the battle, and that the\r\nfighting was renewed around his body.[418] It was then that Bayezid cut\r\ndown Lazar with his own sword. Pray declared that the two sovereigns\r\nwere mortally wounded in a personal combat.[419] The Ottoman historians\r\nbelieved that Murad met his death when walking across the field after\r\nthe battle. A wounded Serbian soldier, who was believed to be dead, rose\r\nwith a supreme effort to his knees and thrust his sword into Murad as he\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Serbian songs, whose testimony the Byzantine historians\r\ncorroborate, and whose story has been followed by some Osmanlis as well,\r\nMurad was assassinated after the battle, or perhaps while the battle was\r\nin progress, by Milosh Obravitch. Stung by the unjust accusation of\r\ntreason in the speech of Lazar on the eve of the battle,[420] Milosh\r\ndetermined to prove his loyalty beyond any question. He got through the\r\nOttoman ranks as a deserter, of whom there must have been many on that\r\nfatal day. His claim of high rank, which was attested by his princely\r\nbearing, secured for him an audience with Murad. When he was face to\r\nface with the emir, he plunged his dagger into the destroyer of his\r\ncountry’s liberties. It is a commentary on the Serbian character that\r\nthis questionable act has been held up to posterity as the most saintly\r\nand heroic deed of national history.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century it was believed, and this belief has been\r\nreproduced as a fact by some modern writers on the Ottoman Empire, that\r\nthe custom of holding a foreign ambassador’s arms when he entered the\r\npresence of the sultan, originated from a regulation to prevent the\r\nrecurrence of such a crime.[421] Like many other Ottoman customs,\r\nhowever, this consistorial ceremony is found among the usages of the\r\nByzantine court,[422] and has persisted in some oriental courts to the\r\npresent day. It has been explained on the ground that ‘a stranger before\r\nthe sovereign is so overwhelmed by the effulgence of his rays that he\r\ncannot stand without support’.[423]\r\n\r\nThe statements of the numbers engaged in the battle of Kossova are so\r\nconflicting that it is impossible to determine how many men took part in\r\nthe action, or which side was the stronger. The Serbian folksongs dwell\r\nupon the tremendous number of the enemy, while the Ottoman historians\r\nreport that the Osmanlis mustered so few in comparison with the reported\r\nstrength of the Serbians that there was serious question before the\r\nbattle of the advisability of taking so great a risk as to engage a foe\r\nwhose numerical advantage was so marked. Including the prisoners, who\r\nwere massacred when Murad’s death was learned by the soldiers, the\r\nSerbians calculated their loss at seventy-seven thousand killed, while\r\nonly twelve thousand of the Osmanlis fell. One important fact we do\r\nknow. The loss of life during the battle and subsequent massacre on the\r\npart of the Serbian nobility was so great that the nation, for the third\r\ntime within thirty years, found itself without leaders.\r\n\r\nTvrtko hurried away from Kossova so fast that he did not realize how\r\noverwhelming had been the defeat. In fact, when he learned of the death\r\nof Murad, he wrote to Florence announcing the glorious victory won under\r\nhis leadership, and the death of the arch enemy of Christendom.[424] The\r\nFlorentines, therefore, celebrated the news of Kossova with a _Te Deum_\r\nin the cathedral. Either this perverted account also reached France, or\r\ntoo great significance was placed upon the death of Murad, for Charles\r\nVI went to Notre Dame to render thanks to God in all solemnity for what\r\nhad happened at Kossova![425] The Serbians themselves were not deceived.\r\nTo them, Kossova was the death-knell to independence. The Hungarians,\r\nalso, awoke immediately to a sense of the danger that threatened them.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nFor thirty years Murad had guided the destinies of the Osmanlis with a\r\npolitical sagacity surpassed by no statesman of his age. It is only\r\nbecause we know so much more of Mohammed the Conqueror and of Soleiman\r\nthe Magnificent that Murad has never received his proper place as the\r\nmost remarkable and most successful statesman and warrior of the house\r\nof Osman. When we measure the difficulties which confronted him, the\r\nproblems which he solved, and the results of his reign, against the\r\ndeeds of his more dazzling successors, we see how easily he stands with\r\nthem, if not above them. The transformation effected in his lifetime is\r\none of the most wonderful records in all history. His conquests were to\r\nendure for five centuries, until the Treaty of Berlin, in 1878: some of\r\nthem have survived the cataclysm of the recent Balkan wars.\r\n\r\nHis energy and zeal for fighting, so like his father’s, and yet put to\r\nthe test of being extended over a field of action far wider than his\r\nfather ever dreamed of, did not flag. He never had a disagreement with\r\nany of his generals or administrators. His system of conquest and of\r\ngovernment, unsupported by tradition or the background of a gradual\r\ngrowth, fitted every condition for which it had been framed. His\r\ntreatment of the Greeks showed superb skill in estimating their\r\ncharacter. Although an infidel and enemy of Christ in the eyes of the\r\nByzantine ecclesiastics, he handled them so much better than the popes\r\nthat he won their sympathies. No more striking proof of his complete\r\nsuccess in a problem of assimilation, at once racial as well as\r\nreligious, can be found than the letter of the Orthodox patriarch\r\nwritten to Pope Urban VI in 1385, in which it is stated that Murad left\r\nto the Church entire liberty of action.[426] In the records of the Greek\r\npatriarchate from 1360 to 1389,[427] one does not find a single instance\r\nof complaint received of ill treatment of the priesthood by the\r\nOsmanlis.\r\n\r\nOsman gathered around him a race, Orkhan created a state, but it was\r\nMurad who founded the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBAYEZID\r\n\r\nTHE OSMANLIS INHERIT THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe death of Murad was immediately avenged upon the battle-field by the\r\nexecution of the prisoners of noble birth. Practically all the Serbian\r\naristocracy that had remained loyal to Lazar and the national cause\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this bloody work, Bayezid sent servants to seek out his\r\nbrother Yakub, who had distinguished himself during the battle, and was\r\nbeing acclaimed by his soldiers. Yakub was taken to Bayezid’s tent, and\r\nstrangled with a bowstring.[428] The new emir justified this crime by a\r\nverse conveniently found for him by his theologians in the Koran: ‘So\r\noften as they return to sedition, they shall be subverted therein; and\r\nif they depart not from you, and offer you peace and restrain their\r\nhands from warring against you, take them and kill them wheresoever ye\r\nfind them.’[429] They declared that the temptation to treason and revolt\r\nwas always present in the brothers of the ruler, and that murder was\r\nbetter than sedition. These doctors of the law might better have pointed\r\nout to Bayezid the admonition of the Prophet: ‘But his soul suffered him\r\nto slay his brother, and he slew him: wherefore he became of the number\r\nof those who perish.’[430] For the abominable practice of removing\r\npossible rival claimants by assassination, thus begun on the field of\r\nKossova, was elevated to the dignity of a law by Mohammed II,[431] and\r\nhas been until our own times a blot upon the house of Osman.\r\n\r\nBayezid, however, was only following the example of Christian princes of\r\nhis own century. Pedro of Castille killed his brother Don Fadrique;[432]\r\nAndronicus III Comnenos of Trebizond, killed his two brothers, Michael\r\nand George;[433] and Andronicus III Palaeologos assassinated his brother\r\nwhen his father was dying.[434]\r\n\r\nAn order was issued from the battle-field of Kossova to the Kadi of\r\nBrusa, enjoining him to keep secret the death of Murad, and to appear to\r\nbe occupied only with public rejoicing for the victory ‘won from the\r\n_Hungarians_’. With this order, Bayezid forwarded the bodies of his\r\nfather and brother for secret burial at Brusa.[435]\r\n\r\nAgents of the Italian cities came to seek Bayezid after the battle to\r\ncongratulate him, and to ask for the confirmation of the commercial\r\nprivileges granted by Murad. Bayezid showed himself proud and distant.\r\nHe declared that after he had conquered Hungary he would ride so far\r\nthat he would come to Rome and there give his horse oats to eat upon the\r\naltar of St. Peter’s.[436] A change of attitude towards Europe is\r\nstrikingly revealed in this boast. Murad, in spite of crusades projected\r\nagainst him, had been careful not to draw upon himself the attention,\r\nmuch less the ill-will, of the western Christian princes. He was\r\naggressive, but never any more so than he needed to be for the moment at\r\nhand: and he was never aggressively Mohammedan. Bayezid, from the very\r\nbeginning of his reign, took no pains to conceal his enmity to\r\nChristendom, and his desire to pose as the champion of Islam. He sought\r\nalliances with the Sultan of Egypt[437] and other Moslem rulers, and\r\nplaced the utmost importance upon the extension of Ottoman sovereignty\r\nin Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAfter the bloodthirst of Kossova had been satisfied and his father’s\r\ndeath avenged, Bayezid was eager to enter into friendly relations with\r\nStephen Bulcovitz, son and heir of Lazar. He felt that the Serbians had\r\nlearned their lesson, and that they would be more helpful to him as\r\nallies than as crushed and sullen foes. He needed their aid in the\r\nAnatolian campaign which he was contemplating, and they were essential\r\nto the safety of his European possessions as a buffer against the\r\nHungarians, who he knew would take the opportunity of his absence in\r\nAsia to move down the Danube. So he treated Stephen and the surviving\r\nSerbians with great kindness. Stephen received all the privileges that\r\nhad belonged to his father.[438] The Serbians were assured of an\r\nequitable share of the booty in the campaigns in which they would\r\nengage. On the other hand, Stephen agreed to allow Bayezid an annual\r\ntribute, secured by the revenues of the silver mines, to command a\r\ncontingent in person in the Ottoman army, and to give his sister to the\r\nOttoman emir.[439] Kossova was forgiven on both sides.\r\n\r\nBayezid took Despina, daughter of Lazar, as wife by a formal marriage\r\nact, which was read in the mosque of Aladja Hissar, near Krutchevatz,\r\nat the foot of Mount Iastrebatz, twenty miles north-west of Nish.[440]\r\nThis was the last marriage ever contracted by a sovereign of the house\r\nof Osman.[441] It sealed an alliance that proved very advantageous to\r\nBayezid. Throughout his life he was devoted to Despina, and his\r\nbrother-in-law Stephen in turn was a devoted and steadfast friend. The\r\nSerbians were faithful allies to the Osmanlis, and fought with them at\r\nNicopolis and Angora. On his side, Bayezid kept the allegiance of the\r\nSerbians by giving them opportunities for winning booty in the raids\r\nagainst the Albanians, Dalmatians, and Hungarians, and by favouring the\r\nOrthodox Church. When we see how complacently and cheerfully the\r\nSerbians--except the poets--took upon themselves the Ottoman yoke, we\r\nmust believe that Kossova was regarded as a terrible calamity only by\r\nthe generations of after centuries, who found the Ottoman rule harder\r\nthan it had been for their ancestors.\r\n\r\nBayezid placed a strong Ottoman colony in Uskub, and settled Moslems in\r\nthe country between Uskub and Nish.[442] There were probably many also\r\nwho saw that conversion was to their advantage. However that may be,\r\nBayezid never had any trouble from the Serbians during his reign.\r\n\r\nStephen Tvrtko, kral of Bosnia, did not consider Kossova a defeat.\r\nSeeing that his great enemy Murad and his great rival Lazar had found\r\ndeath on the battle-field, and that the Osmanlis did not follow up\r\ntheir victory, this view-point was natural. After Kossova, Tvrtko\r\nincreased in power and prestige. He called himself king of Bosnia,\r\nSerbia, Croatia, and Dalmatia. Like Stephen Dushan, he was planning ‘for\r\ngreat things’ when he died in March, 1391, after a reign of thirty-eight\r\nyears.[443]\r\n\r\nShortly before his death, Tvrtko had successfully resisted an Ottoman\r\ninvasion with the help of a Hungarian army sent to him by Sigismund. His\r\nsuccessor, Stephen Dabitcha, however, departed from this wise policy. He\r\nquarrelled with the Hungarians, and played into Bayezid’s hand by\r\nopposing Sigismund in his final effort to stem the tide of Ottoman\r\ninvasion. The Bosnians paid to the full the penalty of their king’s\r\nfolly. In 1398, Bosnia was invaded by a great army of Osmanlis and\r\nSerbians, who ‘destroyed almost all the country and led away the people\r\ninto slavery’.[444] In spite of the sweeping assertion of the\r\nchronicler, this must have been only a raid. For, from 1398 to 1415, the\r\nBosnians, still independent, were fighting with Ragusa and Hungary. In\r\n1415, they voluntarily allied themselves with the Osmanlis, and repeated\r\nthe same old story of the other Balkan races. Mohammed I was called in\r\nto help them against the Hungarians.[445] The Osmanlis came, and they\r\nremained.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn the second year of his reign, after he had arranged a suitable\r\n_status quo_ with the Serbians of upper Macedonia, Bayezid began that\r\npolicy of aggrandizement in Asia Minor which led finally to his\r\ndownfall. His first encroachment was against Isa bey of Aïdin. Isa was\r\ntoo weak to oppose Bayezid single-handed. Instead of seeking to ally the\r\nindependent emirs against the Osmanlis, Isa thought he could save\r\nhimself with less risk by becoming a vassal of Bayezid. He was compelled\r\nto give up Ayasoluk, and make Tyra his capital. Bayezid almost\r\nimmediately broke faith with Isa, and exiled him to Brusa or Nicaea,\r\nwhere he died.[446] His two sons, Isa and Omar, managed to escape to the\r\ncourt of Timur, who was rapidly becoming the most powerful Moslem ruler\r\nin Asia.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Ephesus aroused momentarily Bayezid’s ambition to take\r\npossession of Smyrna. In 1391, he did in fact make some efforts to\r\noverpower the garrison, which was greatly weakened by pestilence.[447]\r\nLater he occupied the passes around Smyrna to prevent the entrance of\r\nprovisions.[448] But Smyrna, like Constantinople, could not be starved\r\nout so long as the Osmanlis were not masters of the sea. Bayezid never\r\npressed this mild form of siege to a definite assault. His hands were\r\ntoo full elsewhere. An unsuccessful assault against Smyrna would have\r\ndestroyed his prestige in the new territory of Aïdin, which was not any\r\ntoo securely his by the suppression of its ruling family. Perhaps, also,\r\nhe realized that Smyrna, more than any other place in the Levant except\r\nRhodes, had become the city of promise to the Roman Church. He did not\r\nwant to stir up an active resistance on the part of the chevaliers of\r\nRhodes, for they might easily be induced to lend aid to the emirs whom\r\nhe was destroying.\r\n\r\nSarukhan and Menteshe, during the reign of Murad, had lost the most\r\nvirile element of their population in corsair expeditions. The Turks of\r\nwhom one reads as the roving and raiding adventurers in the Aegaean and\r\nMediterranean during the fourteenth century were largely from these\r\nemirates. Decades of outgo without a corresponding income in fighting\r\nmen so depleted the maritime emirates that they were not in a position\r\nto withstand Bayezid as they had done his father and grandfather. Their\r\npopulation was seafaring, and their princes were traders rather than\r\nwarriors. When the armies of Bayezid invaded Sarukhan and Menteshe, the\r\ntwo emirs attempted no resistance. They took refuge with Bayezid, emir\r\nof Kastemuni, and abandoned their emirates to the Osmanlis.[449]\r\n\r\nThe result of the acquisition of Sarukhan, Aïdin, and Menteshe was the\r\nimmediate appearance of the Osmanlis upon the Aegaean Sea. This is the\r\nbeginning of the Ottoman naval power, which did not, however, have any\r\ndevelopment during the reign of Bayezid. The first Ottoman naval\r\nexpedition started out in the late autumn of 1390. Sixty vessels made a\r\ndescent upon Chios, and devastated the island. Negropont (Euboea) and\r\nthe coast of Attica suffered the ravages of the raiders.[450] Bayezid\r\nnow forbade the exportation of grain from Asia to Lemnos, Lesbos, Chios,\r\nand Rhodes. But he was hardly yet in a position to enforce this embargo.\r\n\r\nThe Christians of the Aegaean islands and of the eastern Mediterranean\r\nsoon learned that a new design, which had before been lacking, animated\r\nthe Turkish expeditions. It was the desire not so much for booty as for\r\nthe permanent possession of land. Everywhere they went, the Osmanlis\r\nwent as settlers. They fought for homes and wives.\r\n\r\nIn the south, Bayezid took Adalia, the last city of the emir of Tekke.\r\nIt was in 1391 that the Osmanlis won this seaport, their first on the\r\nMediterranean. If we except the southern ports of the Peloponnesus, a\r\nwhole century passed before they added another on the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nFollowing up the pretext furnished him by a complaint against Alaeddin\r\nfrom his vassal, the emir of Hamid, Bayezid determined to measure his\r\nforces against the Karamanlis. As had been the case in the previous\r\nsimilar expeditions under his father, four years before, Bayezid called\r\nout the levies of his European Christian vassals. Among those who\r\nresponded to the call was Manuel Palaeologos, who passed the winter of\r\n1390-91 in the Ottoman camp at Angora. There he wrote his famous\r\ndialogues on the Christian religion, purporting to be discussions with a\r\nMoslem professor of theology.[451]\r\n\r\nBayezid invaded Karamania, and laid siege to Konia. Alaeddin, who had\r\nfled to the Taurus Mountains to escape being shut up in the city, saw\r\nsoon that Konia could hold out against Bayezid for an indefinite period.\r\nThe Ottoman emir was far from his base of supplies, and nervous about\r\nwhat was happening in Europe. So, when Alaeddin asked for terms of\r\npeace, Bayezid agreed to withdraw from Konia, if Alaeddin would formally\r\ncede to him the north-western corner of his dominions, including the\r\ncities of Aksheïr and Akseraï, which were already in the hands of the\r\nOsmanlis.[452] Bayezid left Timurtash as governor of the new\r\nacquisitions, and returned to Adrianople.\r\n\r\nWhile Bayezid was occupied in Bulgaria, in 1392, in his first defensive\r\ncampaign against Sigismund, Alaeddin decided upon a supreme effort to\r\nwrest from Bayezid the hegemony of Asia Minor. He reoccupied the ceded\r\ncities, and attacked by surprise the Ottoman army in Kermian. Timurtash\r\nwas taken prisoner. One column of the Karamanlis set out for Angora, and\r\nthe other for Brusa.\r\n\r\nBayezid earned for himself the nickname _yildirim_ (thunderbolt) by the\r\nrapidity with which he transported his army into Anatolia.[453] Fresh\r\nfrom a victory over the Hungarians, supported by the trained and\r\nhardened soldiery of his Christian vassals, Greeks, Serbians,\r\nBulgarians, and Wallachians, his sudden appearance at Brusa caused\r\nAlaeddin to try once more to treat with the rival who was rapidly\r\nbecoming more powerful than himself. He released Timurtash, and\r\nsuggested a return to the _status quo_ of the previous year.\r\n\r\nBayezid was not only convinced that a decisive struggle was now\r\nadvisable: he was also quick to see that for the first time the\r\nadvantage was all on the side of the Osmanlis. Instead of meeting the\r\nenemy in the heart of his own country, after a long journey across\r\nwind-swept plateaux where food was scarce, it was the enemy this time\r\nwho had made the journey and was far from home. Defeated, there would be\r\nno retreat possible for Alaeddin.\r\n\r\nWith characteristic celerity, Bayezid sent forward an army under\r\nTimurtash. Battle was joined in the plain of Ak Tchaï (the white river).\r\nOne cannot determine the exact location, but it was probably in Kermian\r\nnot far from Kutayia, for that is where the two retreating columns of\r\nthe Karamanlis would naturally have formed a junction. Alaeddin and his\r\nsons Ali and Mahommed were taken prisoners. When Alaeddin was brought\r\nbefore him, Timurtash could not restrain his anger until Bayezid\r\narrived. He remembered only that the one defeat of his long and\r\nbrilliant career had been administered by Alaeddin. Its disgrace, and\r\nhis feeling towards the emir of Karamania, was in no way palliated by\r\nthe fact that Alaeddin had voluntarily released him. Timurtash ordered\r\nthe prisoner to be hanged. When Bayezid arrived, his brother-in-law was\r\ndead. He was overjoyed that his rival had been removed so conveniently,\r\nand without any responsibility falling upon himself.\r\n\r\nKaramania lay open before the invaders. The Osmanlis occupied Ak Seraï,\r\nKonia, and Laranda. There was no organized resistance. But it is a\r\ncurious disregard of facts to record, as most historians have done,[454]\r\nthat the result of this campaign was the permanent incorporation of\r\nKaramania in the Ottoman Empire.[455] The battle of Ak Tchaï had been\r\ndecisive only to the extent that thereafter the Osmanlis, and not the\r\nKaramanlis, were to be the dominant race in Asia Minor. Konia and other\r\neastern Karamanian cities were occupied by the Osmanlis after the battle\r\nbecause their ruler had been killed and his sons taken into captivity.\r\nHad Alaeddin escaped from the field, he might have organized a\r\nsuccessful resistance to the Ottoman invaders. Bayezid conquered\r\nKaramania by the battle of Ak Tchaï no more than Napoleon conquered\r\nPrussia by Jena or von Moltke France by Sedan. To enter and occupy for\r\na while the capital of a country does not mean that the country is\r\n‘incorporated’ in the domains of the successful invader. The immediate\r\nrestoration of the Karamanian dynasty after the advent of Timur proves\r\nhow superficial had been the Ottoman occupation. While they were no\r\nlonger able to be a political factor in western Asia Minor, the\r\nKaramanlis continued until after the fall of Constantinople--for seventy\r\nyears after the battle of Ak Tchaï--to defy successfully the efforts of\r\nthe Osmanlis to destroy their independence and amalgamate them.[456]\r\n\r\nBurhaneddin, who had set up for himself a principality north-east of\r\nKaramania along the Halys River, which included Caesarea and Sivas, was\r\nthe next rival on the east to be attacked. Burhaneddin is reported to\r\nhave had twenty to thirty thousand followers.[457] This seems to be an\r\nexaggeration, for we read that he did not resist the Ottoman invasion.\r\nAt the approach of Bayezid, he retired into the mountains of Armenia\r\nnear Kharput. Here he was either killed by Kara Yuluk, founder of the\r\nfamous White Sheep dynasty, or put to death by order of Bayezid.[458]\r\nHis emirate was shared by Bayezid and Kara Yuluk, the Ottoman emir\r\ntaking Tokat, Caesarea, and Sivas. There is no certainty as to the date\r\nof this expedition. From the events which followed, it most probably\r\ntook place in 1395, the year before Nicopolis.[459]\r\n\r\nKastamuni, practically coterminous with the Roman province of\r\nPaphlagonia, stood between the Ottoman possessions and the Black Sea. In\r\nthe campaign of 1393, Samsun and the cities of the interior between\r\nSamsun and Angora, were captured by the Osmanlis. When the Ottoman army\r\nadvanced to attack Kastamuni, Bayezid offered to allow the emir to\r\nbecome his vassal, if he would surrender to him the emirs of Sarukhan\r\nand Menteshe. Whether the lesser Bayezid was unwilling to violate the\r\nlaws of hospitality, or put little faith in the promises of the\r\nconqueror after the fate which had overtaken the emir of Aïdin, it is\r\nimpossible to say. He and his guests fled to the court of Timur. The\r\noccupation of Sinope gave the Osmanlis an excellent port on the south\r\ncoast of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nBayezid was now master of the greater part of Anatolia, but master only\r\nin name. He had not assimilated these conquests. As later events proved,\r\nthe inhabitants of these territories were still loyal to their former\r\nrulers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAfter his return from the first Anatolian campaign, Bayezid ordered a\r\ngeneral advance along the northern and north-western frontiers. One band\r\ninvaded Bosnia, but did not make much headway. Three bands entered\r\nHungary, and initiated the system of rapid raiding that in time reached\r\nas far as Germany, and made the ‘Turks’ the nightmare of Slavic,\r\nTeutonic, and Italian Europe. The first battle on Hungarian soil was\r\nfought at Nagy-Olosz, in Syrmia, not far from Karlovitz, where three\r\ncenturies later the Osmanlis signed the death-warrant of their\r\n_Weltpolitik_.\r\n\r\nThe Danube was crossed also near Silistria. Before the terrible\r\nakindjis could penetrate far into his country, the hospodar Mircea\r\nsurrendered, or was made prisoner. After a short exile at Brusa, he\r\nregained his liberty by consenting to the payment of a tribute of three\r\nthousand ducats, thirty horses, and twenty falcons.[460] He agreed to\r\nhelp Bayezid against the Hungarians, who had long been asserting a\r\nsovereignty over Wallachia, and in return Bayezid promised to settle no\r\nMoslems and build no mosques north of the Danube. In the first Hungarian\r\ninvasion, Bayezid received more valuable aid from the Wallachians than\r\nfrom his janissaries. There were no better fighters in the Balkan\r\npeninsula than these descendants of the soldiers of Trajan. The\r\ninterference of Sigismund prevented an Ottoman invasion of Moldavia,\r\nwhose hospodars remained altogether independent of the Osmanlis until\r\nthe reign of Mohammed the Conqueror.[461]\r\n\r\nWhen Louis of Hungary died, he left two daughters. The younger, Hedwig,\r\nwas chosen as queen of Poland by the Polish nobles. Her marriage with\r\nJagello of Lithuania, who was converted to Christianity and baptized\r\nunder the name of Ladislas, definitely separated the crowns of Poland\r\nand Hungary, and had a far-reaching influence upon the subsequent\r\nfortunes of the Osmanlis. The crown of Hungary fell to Mary, whose\r\nsuccession was questioned by Charles of Durazzo, king of Naples, the\r\nnearest male heir. His invasion of Dalmatia, in 1385, brought into\r\nHungary Sigismund, second son of Charles IV of Luxemburg, the German\r\nEmperor. For Sigismund was betrothed to Mary, but had been slow to take\r\nupon himself the rôle of bridegroom, owing to his disappointment over\r\nHedwig’s election by the Poles. Now he entered into the struggle for the\r\nHungarian crown. In 1387, it was placed upon his head. The union between\r\nPoland and Hungary was broken, but the fortunes of Hungary and Bohemia,\r\nto which throne Sigismund succeeded by blood, were joined in a way that\r\nhas never been broken to the present time. The outside connexions of the\r\nnew Hungarian king were a most important factor in the growth of the\r\nOttoman Empire. A strong and vigorous king, whose sole interest lay in\r\nthe crown of Hungary, might have prevented the spread of the Osmanlis.\r\nIn fact, after Bayezid’s death, he might easily have destroyed the\r\nOttoman power in Europe. But Sigismund, called in 1411 to the larger\r\nrôle of Holy Roman Emperor, became engrossed in the Hussite controversy\r\nand the Church councils to end the great schism. While retaining the\r\ncrown of Hungary, he allowed the Osmanlis to make the preparations which\r\nwere to end in the Moslem subjugation of that kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn the early days, when Sigismund’s interests lay in his newly-acquired\r\nHungarian crown, he was alive to the menace of the Osmanlis. He sent a\r\nmessage to Bayezid, demanding by what right he was interfering with\r\nBulgaria, which was a country under Hungarian protection. Bayezid made\r\nno response to the address of the king’s ambassador. He merely pointed\r\nto the weapons hanging in his tent, and gave a sign that the audience\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nSigismund understood, and accepted the challenge. In 1392, he invaded\r\nBulgaria, won an initial battle from the Osmanlis, who would have been\r\nannihilated had it not been for their new allies, the Wallachians, and,\r\nafter a long siege, took Nicopolis on the Danube.[462] By this time\r\nBayezid was able to send a large army into Bulgaria. When Sigismund\r\nrealized how numerous were the forces coming against him, he saw that\r\nhis victory bade fair to be nothing more than the acquisition of a\r\nprison. Before the Osmanlis could surround him, he wisely abandoned\r\nNicopolis. The retreat became a rout.[463] It was on the return from\r\nthis expedition that Sigismund met Elisabeth Morsinay, in the county of\r\nHunyadi. From their union was born the great champion, who, while his\r\nimperial father was engrossed in theological disputes and the complex\r\ninterests of the empire, battled bravely against Mohammed I and Murad\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of 1392 demonstrated to Sigismund that Bayezid was a foe\r\nworthy of a European ruler, that he must be checked if Hungary were to\r\nbe saved, and that the Hungarians could not again take the offensive\r\nagainst the Osmanlis without aid from western Europe. For the\r\npretensions of Louis to the overlordship of the Balkan States, and the\r\nheartless propaganda of the Catholic faith, thinly disguising Louis’s\r\ninordinate ambitions, had turned the Balkan peoples against Hungary and\r\n‘crusaders’ from the west. They chose rather to stand on the side of\r\ntheir Moslem enslavers.\r\n\r\nSigismund’s invasion of Bulgaria determined Bayezid to put an end to the\r\narrangement concluded just before Kossova between Murad and Sisman.\r\nBulgaria, like Thrace and Macedonia, was to be an integral part of the\r\nempire, and to become converted to Islam and ottomanized, in so far as\r\nthat was possible. For Sisman, who had re-established himself in his old\r\ncapital, was too uncertain an ally to be trusted in the event of\r\nanother Hungarian invasion. In the spring of 1393, an army under\r\nSoleiman Tchelebi, Bayezid’s oldest son, to whom this was the first\r\ncommand, surrounded Tirnovo. The bulk of Soleiman’s army was composed of\r\nMacedonian Christians and renegades of the first generation. In\r\nmidsummer,[464] after a three months’ siege, Tirnovo was taken by storm\r\nfrom the side of the old castle, which is still, in part, standing.[465]\r\nThe inhabitants who escaped fire and sword were carried into captivity\r\nin Anatolia. Among them was the patriarch Euthymius.[466]\r\n\r\nThis was the end of the independence of Bulgaria and of the national\r\nchurch. The loss of the church was a more serious blow than the loss of\r\nindependence. For the Bulgarian nationality suffered an eclipse of\r\ncenturies. Under the laws of Mohammed the Conqueror for the\r\n‘self-government’ of the Christian elements of the empire, the\r\nBulgarians were included in the Greek _millet_ (nation). Enemy to every\r\ninfluence, every movement that tended to lessen its temporal power, the\r\nGreek patriarchate of Phanar never wearied in its endeavours, and never\r\nwithheld its approval of the foulest means, to stamp out the Bulgarian\r\nnational spirit. One cannot visit the old monastery of Rilo without\r\nrealizing that the Bulgarian sufferings have been more acute from\r\nChristian priests than from Moslem governors. One cannot follow the\r\ntrail of unending persecution in the mute witness of unchurched\r\ncommunities from Monastir to the Black Sea through Macedonia and Eastern\r\nRumelia, and to the Danube, through Bulgarian Serbia and trans-Rhodopian\r\nMoesia, without sympathizing with the Bulgarian aspirations of 1913, and\r\nwithout comprehending the wild rage and hatred that drove an ordinarily\r\nclear-headed and impassive people into the second Balkan war.[467]\r\n\r\nWhen Tirnovo fell, Sisman was not found in his palace. His fate was a\r\nmystery even when Schiltberger went through Bulgaria with the crusaders\r\nthree years later. Schiltberger believed that he died in captivity.[468]\r\nHis son, Alexander, became a Moslem to save his life, and was given the\r\ngovernorship of Samsun.[469] He was killed fighting under the Ottoman\r\nflag, in 1420, in the rebellion of Dédé-Sultan. The royal family of\r\nBulgaria had no other heirs.\r\n\r\nSilistria, Nicopolis, Widin, and the other Danube fortresses were\r\nstrongly garrisoned and fortified.[470] By conversion and immigration\r\nthe Moslem population was cultivated, and grew rapidly on this northern\r\nfrontier of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe battle of Kossova did not immediately affect Constantinople. Bayezid\r\nwas intent upon arranging the new _status quo_ in Serbia. After he had\r\nassured himself that Sigismund was not ready to attack him, he passed\r\nover into Asia Minor. There he devoted all his energies to the\r\ndestruction of the Turkish emirates.\r\n\r\nThe old family feud of the Palaeologi continued.[471] In April 1390,\r\nJohn, the son of Andronicus, entered Constantinople, and set himself up\r\nas emperor in opposition to his grandfather and uncle. But upon Manuel’s\r\nreturn from Asia in September, he was compelled to flee.[472] The\r\nobligations of Manuel as Ottoman vassal were stronger than the\r\nexigencies of his precarious position at Constantinople. Although his\r\nfather was in an enfeebled condition and the danger of a return of his\r\nnephew was very real, Manuel left again in November to follow Bayezid in\r\nthe war against Karamania.\r\n\r\nWe have a striking record from Manuel’s own pen of his humiliation.\r\nProper food was too dear for the purse of the heir of Constantine the\r\nGreat. He was on the verge of starvation. In sharp contrast to his own\r\nwretchedness, he describes the barbaric splendour of the court of\r\nBayezid, and the feasting in which he was too insignificant to have a\r\nshare. The Osmanlis treated him with studied insolence and\r\ncontempt.[473]\r\n\r\nWhile Bayezid was in Karamania, the old emperor repaired the walls of\r\nhis capital. Churches were torn down in order to rebuild the towers on\r\neither side of the Golden Gate. They were given an ornate appearance to\r\ndisguise the purpose of their having been repaired. Bayezid, informed\r\nthrough his couriers, sent word to John that the towers must be rased\r\nwithout delay, or Manuel would lose his eyes. The old emperor made haste\r\nto obey. Before the demolition was finished, he died in the arms of\r\nEudoxia Comnena, whom he had taken for his mistress after having asked\r\nher hand for his son. Gout and debauchery rather than grief and\r\nhumiliation ended his ignoble life; for he was only sixty-one, and, like\r\nhis father and grandfather, had never opposed the Osmanlis with enough\r\nenergy to undermine his constitution.[474]\r\n\r\nWhen Manuel, in the spring of 1391, returned to Brusa, he learned of his\r\nfather’s death, and of the threat that had been made concerning himself.\r\nEscaping in the night, he fled to Constantinople.\r\n\r\nAn ultimatum soon followed from Bayezid. Beyond the acknowledgement of\r\nvassalage and the payment of an increased tribute, Bayezid demanded the\r\nestablishment of a kadi in Constantinople to judge the Moslem\r\ninhabitants. Upon the heels of his messenger came the Ottoman army. The\r\nGreeks of southern Thrace who had remained Christian were exterminated\r\nor carried off into slavery in Asia. Like locusts, the Osmanlis swarmed\r\nin all directions, and no village missed their notice up to the very\r\nwalls of Constantinople.[475] The first Ottoman siege of Constantinople\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nThe close investment of the city ended after seven months. Bayezid,\r\nneeding his army in Bulgaria to oppose Sigismund, consented to lift the\r\nsiege on still harder conditions than had first been imposed. Manuel\r\nauthorized the establishment of a Mohammedan tribunal in the Sirkedji\r\nquarter, and to give seven hundred houses within the city walls to\r\nMoslem settlers. Half of Galata, from the Genoese Tower to the Sweet\r\nWaters, was ceded to Bayezid, who placed there a garrison of six\r\nthousand. The tribute was once more increased, and the Ottoman treasury\r\nwas allowed a tithe on the vineyards and vegetable gardens outside of\r\nthe city.[476] From the minarets of two mosques, the call to prayer\r\nechoed over the imperial city, which, from this time, began to be called\r\nby the Osmanlis Istambul.[477] This was the city of promise.\r\n\r\nFrom 1391 until the advent of Timur, Constantinople was blockaded on the\r\nland side.[478] The Galata garrison and the posts at Kutchuk and Buyuk\r\nTchekmedje were always alert to bully and harass travellers and\r\nprovision sellers.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Vizier, Ali pasha, used the grandson and namesake of John V\r\nPalaeologos to make trouble for Manuel. It was in his blood to become\r\nthe willing tool of the Osmanlis. In 1393, Ali pasha tried to get the\r\ninhabitants of the city to depose Manuel in order that John, as heir of\r\nthe older son of the late emperor, might take the place which was\r\nrightfully his.[479] Two years later John actually attacked the city\r\nwith Ottoman troops, but was repulsed.[480]\r\n\r\nThe overtures of Manuel for aid and money from Christian princes were\r\nreceived with little enthusiasm. On account of the schism in the Latin\r\nChurch, Manuel could look for no papal support. Venice refused his offer\r\nto sell Lemnos.[481] The time had passed when the Senate set even the\r\nslightest monetary value upon a Byzantine deed of sale to an Aegaean\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIn 1395, at Serres, Bayezid held his first court as heir of the Caesars.\r\nHe summoned before him Manuel and Theodore and John, the son of\r\nAndronicus. Theodore, who had been ruling in the Morea (Peloponnesus),\r\nsole remaining Byzantine theme, was charged with having encroached upon\r\nthe rights of the lord of Monembasia. The few remaining Serbian princes\r\nwere also present. Bayezid contemplated ridding himself altogether of\r\nthe Byzantine imperial family. In fact, he ordered the death of all the\r\nPalaeologi. Ali pasha succeeded in putting off the execution long enough\r\nfor Bayezid to change his mind. The sentence was revoked, but warning\r\nwas given by cutting off the hands and putting out the eyes of several\r\nByzantine dignitaries. The Palaeologi, and Constantinople, had been\r\nsaved only by the intervention of a creature of Bayezid’s, who did not\r\nwant to see the imperial family perish and the imperial city fall\r\nbecause these ghosts of princes were a source of revenue to him!\r\n\r\nThe peril at Serres had been so real that the Byzantine and Serbian\r\nprinces plotted immediately to throw off the Ottoman yoke, and swore to\r\neach other that they would never again answer a summons from Bayezid.\r\nThe compact was sealed by the marriage of Irene, daughter of\r\nConstantine Dragash, to Manuel.[482] But Dragash died shortly after the\r\nmarriage,[483] and Vuk Brankovitch died three years later.[484] They\r\nwere the last of the Serbians of Dushan’s following in Macedonia. The\r\ndisaster of Nicopolis soon crushed the hopes of the conspirators.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nUrban VI, the first Roman pope of the Great Schism, did practically\r\nnothing against the Osmanlis. He sent, in 1388, two armed galleys for\r\nthe defence of Constantinople, and issued letters broadcast promising\r\nindulgences to all who would take part in a crusade.[485] But he did not\r\nwork for a league of the states which recognized him. His successor,\r\nBoniface IX, whose reign covered the same period as that of Bayezid, was\r\ntoo occupied in combating the Angevin party in Naples, and in trying to\r\npreserve intact the papal states and cities, to pay much attention to\r\nthe Ottoman menace.\r\n\r\nIn 1391, Boniface urged George Stracimir, who called himself king of\r\nRascia (Serbia), to conquer Durazzo from the ‘schismatics’, and\r\ncommanded the Catholic archbishop of Antivari to prevent the Christians\r\nof Macedonia and Dalmatia from allying themselves with the\r\nOsmanlis.[486] Idle words these were, revealing at once the\r\nshort-sighted policy of Boniface and his bigotry. For the Osmanlis, in\r\nthe spring of 1393, were threatening Durazzo.[487] With warring\r\nChristian sects, their success was certain.\r\n\r\nIn Greece the interference of the Latin popes was becoming more and more\r\nbitterly resented. Ecclesiastics and laymen alike resented proselytizing\r\nand the invariable introduction of a bargaining clause in every appeal\r\nfor western aid. In March 1393, Dorotheus, metropolitan of Athens and\r\nexarch of Greece, who had been justly charged by the Duke of Athens with\r\nwanting to introduce into his duchy the Osmanlis, was a fugitive at\r\nConstantinople. Tried on the charge brought against him by the Duke, a\r\nsynod of eight bishops acquitted him.[488] This action was indicative of\r\nthe feeling throughout the Eastern Church,--better the Osmanlis than the\r\nFranks with their Catholic missionaries. Even the changed attitude of\r\nBayezid towards Christianity did little to modify this sentiment.\r\n\r\nAlthough France was supporting the Avignon papacy, Boniface wrote in\r\n1394 to Charles VI, asking him to help Sigismund or at least to allow\r\nhis subjects to fight under the Hungarian standards.[489] In the course\r\nof the same year he twice ordered a crusade to be preached.[490] This\r\nwas, however, rather an attempt to take under his wing, and give\r\nsanction to, a secular movement to help Hungary than an initiative which\r\nhad originated the movement. For most of Sigismund’s allies were\r\nadherents of the other papacy.\r\n\r\nAt Avignon, Benedict XIII, a Spaniard, mounted the throne in 1394. His\r\ninfluence with the Duke of Burgundy, who dominated the insane French\r\nking, was almost as negligible as that of his Roman rival.\r\n\r\nPhilippe de Mézières, who had taken up the work of Marino Sanudo, and\r\ngave his life to the promotion of a crusade, left Cyprus in 1378, and\r\nsettled in Paris, where he preached and wrote impassioned appeals to\r\nChristendom to rescue the Holy Sepulchre. His ‘Order of the Passion’,\r\nwhich was to furnish a race of fighters against the Moslem holders of\r\nJerusalem, had replaced the celibate vow of the earlier orders by a vow\r\nof marital fidelity, so that ‘defenders of the Holy Sepulchre’ might be\r\npropagated, and trained from infancy for their mission. The whole idea\r\nof Philippe de Mézières was an anachronism. The age of the crusades had\r\npassed. After 1390 the new order fell into oblivion.[491] Like Marino\r\nSanudo, Philippe de Mézières had actually contributed to the\r\naggrandizement of the Osmanlis; for he turned the minds of those who\r\nwere moved by his appeals from the real menace of Islam to a quixotic\r\nand wholly useless dream. The crusades had only emphasized the axiom of\r\nhistory that Syria, including Palestine, must be held either through\r\nMesopotamia or through Egypt.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Osmanlis as against the Moslems of the Holy Land, the Church\r\nwas no longer able to move Europe. The Nicopolis crusade was undertaken\r\nand carried through by secular agencies. It had neither religious motive\r\nnor religious backing.\r\n\r\nThe interest of Hungary in checking the progress of Ottoman conquest was\r\nhardly second to that of Venice and Genoa. To the two Italian republics,\r\nwho had not hesitated to stake their very existence a decade before upon\r\nthe mastery of the Aegaean Sea and the free passage of the Dardanelles,\r\none would suppose that the battle of Kossova would have been a salutary\r\nwarning, and that they would have seen the necessity of opposing the\r\nOsmanlis to the full extent of their resources. The archives of these\r\ncities, however, during the entire reign of Bayezid, reveal a record of\r\ndouble-dealing and insincere diplomacy which was as futile and\r\ndisastrous as it was shameful.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon hearing the news of Kossova, the Venetian Senate sent\r\nto Andrea Bembo, who had been negotiating with Murad, a letter\r\ninstructing him as to the course he should follow in view of the death\r\nof Murad. He was to seek out the son who had survived, or, if both sons\r\nwere alive, to be very cautious until one son had killed or defeated the\r\nother. In the meantime, he was to make overtures to both, telling each\r\none, without letting the other know, that the Senate ‘had heard of the\r\ndeath of his father, and on that account had great sorrow. For we have\r\nalways regarded him as a most particular friend, and we loved him and\r\nhis state. Likewise we have heard of his happy elevation to the power\r\nand lordship of his country, concerning which we have been very happy,\r\nbecause, in like manner as we have sincerely loved the father, we love\r\nand are disposed to love the son and his dominion, and to regard him as\r\na particular friend.’ Then Bembo was to speak of the commercial\r\nprivileges desired by the Senate, and to disclaim the action of the\r\nVenetian admiral, Pietro Zeno, who had attacked the galleys of\r\nMurad.[492]\r\n\r\nImmediately upon hearing which son had become the successor of Murad,\r\nthe Senate sent Francesco Quirini to Bayezid with gifts to secure the\r\nrenewal of the commercial treaty concluded several years before with\r\nMurad. Bayezid readily offered to protect Venetian commerce, but he\r\ngave no guarantee.[493]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Osmanlis on the Aegaean Sea, and their sacking of\r\nChios, Negropont,[494] and Attica, greatly alarmed the Senate. Fear was\r\nexpressed for the safety of the Venetian fortresses in Negropont and\r\nCrete.[495] All garrisons were ordered, provisioned, and\r\nreinforced.[496] In 1393, forgetting their sincere love for Bayezid, the\r\nSenate decided to treat with Sigismund for an offensive alliance against\r\nthe Osmanlis.[497] So it cannot be believed that the Venetians did not\r\nsee the growing danger.\r\n\r\nIn September of the next year they responded favourably, although\r\nvaguely, to a letter in which Sigismund notified them that in the coming\r\nspringtime he would ‘go against the Turks to their loss and\r\ndestruction’.[498] But when, in May 1396, a Hungarian embassy arrived in\r\nVenice to announce the readiness for a forward movement, and to secure\r\nthe promised aid, Venice pledged herself only to the extent of four\r\ngalleys, and that on condition that Rhodes, Chios, and Mytilene would\r\nco-operate with the Venetians.[499] A high-sounding letter was sent to\r\nTommaso Monicego, ordering him to move against the Osmanlis ‘for the\r\npreservation of the city of Constantinople and for the honour of the\r\nrepublic’.[500] Too weak and too inexperienced to withstand the hardened\r\nmariners of Italy, the Osmanlis disappeared from the sea for the moment.\r\nTheir navy was only six years old, and could not yet match itself\r\nagainst the _ghiaours_. Monicego fought no battle, for there was no\r\nenemy to oppose him. But he made no effort to hinder the passage of the\r\nOsmanlis from Asia to Europe and from Europe to Asia. The sincerity of\r\nthe naval co-operation in the Nicopolis crusade is open to the gravest\r\nsuspicion.[501]\r\n\r\nWhile the Senate was putting off Sigismund with assurances and promises\r\nthat never materialized, they continued to treat with Bayezid and\r\nManuel. In September 1394, the Osmanlis appeared in the Adriatic at the\r\nmouth of the Boyana, and seized Venetian subjects there. The danger to\r\nDurazzo was imminent, for the Osmanlis were now masters of the valley of\r\nthe Drin. When the Senate deliberated on measures for securing the\r\nrelease of the prisoners and for the defence of Durazzo, they decided to\r\nmake representations rather than threats to Bayezid.[502] He naturally\r\npaid no attention to the Venetians. They did not intend to apply force,\r\nso he continued the subjugation of Albania and Greece.\r\n\r\nTo Manuel the Senate wrote a letter in 1394, recommending him ‘to trust\r\nin God, to trust in the measures which the Christian princes would know\r\nhow to take, to write to the pope and to these (the Christian princes),\r\npromoting a general alliance’.[503] But one finds in the deliberations\r\nof the Senate no speech or motion or letter from which one could infer\r\nthat they themselves had any hope whatever of the efficacy of the\r\nprocedure suggested to Manuel. In fact, within six months, in spite of\r\nthe imminence of the Hungarian offensive campaign that was to ‘drive the\r\nTurks out of Europe’, the Senate actually decided to send ambassadors\r\nto Bayezid to urge upon him the advisability of an accord with the\r\nByzantine emperor.[504] It was only because the crusade of Sigismund was\r\nalready launched, and they realized the uselessness of it, that they\r\ngave up this questionable _démarche_, and discussed measures for the\r\nsafety of the Venetian fleet, and for preventing Constantinople from\r\nfalling into Bayezid’s hands without coming into any open rupture with\r\nthe Osmanlis.[505] Did Venice, while ostensibly co-operating with the\r\ncrusaders, fear that a victory at Nicopolis would bring about the\r\nhegemony of Hungary in the Balkan peninsula, and secretly wish for the\r\nsuccess of the Osmanlis?\r\n\r\nAs for Genoa, no other policy was considered than that of outbidding\r\nVenice for Bayezid’s favour. Fulsome congratulations upon his succession\r\nwere sent to Bayezid. In the autumn of 1390, a Genoese embassy appeared\r\nat Adrianople to remind Bayezid of the traditional friendship of the\r\nConsulta for his father and grandfather. Their assurances were backed up\r\nby valuable gifts.[506] While cultivating the friendship of the\r\nOsmanlis, the Consulta levied a compulsory tax upon all the communes\r\nwhere they could enforce their authority for the purpose of increasing\r\nthe Genoese fleets in the Aegaean Sea and at Constantinople.[507] A\r\nwatchful eye was kept on the Venetians and the Osmanlis. Neither\r\nSigismund nor Manuel received real aid from Genoa.\r\n\r\nFor the necessary outside support and assistance in the crusade which\r\nappeared to him indispensable for the safety of Hungary, Sigismund had\r\nto look elsewhere than to the divided papacy, and to the republics of\r\nVenice and Genoa. Whether Sigismund’s fears of the ability of the\r\nOsmanlis to destroy Hungary were well founded is open to question. But\r\nthere is no doubt that his activity prevented the capture of\r\nConstantinople in the early years of the reign of Bayezid.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAs early as 1384, the French Court was aware of the remarkable progress\r\nof the Ottoman conquest. The character and ambitions of Murad were\r\npresented to the boy-king Charles VI in a striking way. He was told that\r\nMurad, in a dream, had seen Apollon, one of his false gods, who offered\r\nhim a crown of gold before which were prostrated thirteen princes of the\r\nOccident.[508] This childhood impression was revived in 1391, when\r\nCharles was at the zenith of his emancipation under the Marmousets. He\r\nreceived an embassy of pilgrims from the Holy Land, who brought news of\r\na defeat they had experienced while fighting with the King of Hungary\r\n‘against the Turks of Lamorat Baxin’. When Charles asked them about the\r\ngenealogy and antecedents of the prince, whose name they confused with\r\nthat of his father, they knew nothing of him except that he was ‘a\r\nvassal of the King of Persia’.\r\n\r\nBut of his character and ambitions they made a statement which we are\r\njustified in quoting, because it throws light upon the notions\r\nprevailing in the minds of the French aristocracy who went to their\r\ndeath at Nicopolis. ‘He was’, said the pilgrims, ‘a man of wisdom and\r\ndiscretion, who feared God according to the superstitious traditions of\r\nthe Turks ... humane towards the conquered, because he oppressed them\r\nvery little with exactions, and did not expel them from their lands so\r\nlong as they were willing to promise allegiance under an annual tribute,\r\nhowever small. He kept his promises, and permitted them to live under\r\ntheir own laws.... His seal was so respected in his army that whoever\r\nsaw it fell upon his knees. He had interpreters and spies in Europe to\r\ninstruct him about the kings and their policies. _He told the pilgrims\r\nthat he would come to France after he had finished with Austria._’[509]\r\n\r\nThe chronicler from whom this report is taken added that Charles was\r\nmuch excited by this threat. He was anxious to make peace with England,\r\nin order that he could accept the challenge of Bayezid, and go to fight\r\nhim in single combat at the head of his army. But Charles, in the\r\nfollowing year, so completely lost his mental balance that he could no\r\nlonger maintain any personal power, and fell under the influence of the\r\nprinces of the lilies. But his sympathies remained steadfastly attached\r\nto every scheme for fighting the Osmanlis.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1395, the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy, uncles of the\r\nking, who had for the moment all the power of the French crown in their\r\nhands, received at Lyons ambassadors from Sigismund, who came to demand\r\naid against the Osmanlis. Philip of Burgundy was greatly interested in\r\nthis mission. It is extremely improbable that he had any interest\r\nwhatever in the Christians of the Balkan peninsula, the aggrandizement\r\nof Hungary, or even the preservation of Constantinople from Moslem\r\nsacrilege. But, since Flanders, Artois, and the county of Burgundy had\r\ncome to him through his wife on the death of Louis le Mâle, Philip had\r\nbegun to dream of establishing a new kingdom in Europe. It was the dream\r\nwhich was to plunge France into the most bitter of her civil wars, to\r\ncall forth Jeanne d’Arc from the seclusion of Domrémy, and end in the\r\ndeath of his great-grandson under the walls of Nancy.\r\n\r\nPhilip had every reason in the world to aid the project of Sigismund.\r\nApart from the fact that his immediate hold over the insane king,\r\nCharles VI, would be strengthened by the absence from France of the\r\nenergetic scions of noble families, who, if successful in the struggle\r\nagainst Bayezid, might push on to the Holy Land and find permanent\r\ninterests--or a grave--there, Sigismund was well worth cultivating. The\r\nelder brother of the king of Hungary, Wenceslaus, was Roman emperor, but\r\ninsecure in his position. At that very moment, Wenceslaus was\r\nnegotiating with Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti to create him Duke of Milan\r\nin exchange for his support.[510] Galeazzo was the father-in-law of\r\nLouis of Orleans, younger brother of the French king, and Philip’s\r\nformidable rival. The future of the Valois of Burgundy demanded an\r\n_entente_ with the German imperial family. As this could not be\r\nconcluded with Wenceslaus, and as Wenceslaus might at any moment be\r\ndeposed, it was policy for Philip of Burgundy to come into close contact\r\nwith Sigismund, whose future in Bohemia and in the empire Philip\r\nforesaw. At the very least, by lending aid to Sigismund, Philip had an\r\nexcellent chance of getting Luxemburg, which was essential to the\r\nconsolidation of the new Burgundy in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nAs earnest of the aid which would be forthcoming the following year, the\r\nDuke of Burgundy allowed the Comte d’Eu to proceed immediately to\r\nHungary with some nobles and six hundred horsemen.[511] After the\r\nHungarian envoys had gone through the formality of an audience with the\r\nking at Paris, they returned to Sigismund bearing a letter in which\r\nPhilip promised substantial aid in cavaliers and mercenaries, under the\r\ncommand of his own elder son, Jean Valois, Comte de Nevers.\r\n\r\nFrom England, the Netherlands, Savoy, Lombardy, and all parts of\r\nGermany, Sigismund received assurances that the cream of chivalry would\r\nflock to his standards, and that he could rely upon Europe to back him\r\nin the expedition which was to drive Bayezid out of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThe crusade which ended in the disaster of Nicopolis is one of the most\r\ninteresting events of the close of the Middle Ages, not only by reason\r\nof the historical importance of those who took part in it, but also\r\nbecause it was the last great international enterprise of feudal\r\nchivalry. It is the end of an epoch in the history of Europe. So\r\nwidespread was the interest in Sigismund’s call to arms against the\r\nOsmanlis that there came to meet him at Buda in the spring of 1396 not\r\nonly the French volunteers, but also scions of noble families from\r\nEngland, Scotland, Flanders, Lombardy, Savoy, Bohemia, and all parts of\r\nGermany and Austria. The English war in Normandy had ceased, Milan was\r\nsupreme in northern Italy, and for the moment there was peace in the\r\nHoly Roman Empire. It was a favourable time to attract adventurers to\r\nunknown lands.\r\n\r\nThis expedition furnishes the most absorbing pages in the last portion\r\nof Froissart;[512] it is mentioned in more or less detail in a number of\r\nother French, Italian, German, and Latin chronicles. Several\r\nparticipants have left graphic accounts of the gathering of the\r\nchevaliers, the march down the Danube, the battle and its aftermath of\r\nmassacre, the captivity and ransom of the prisoners. The archives of\r\nDijon and Lille tell the cost of the fitting out of the French\r\ncontingent and of the ransom of the prisoners. For this crowning event\r\nin Bayezid’s career, we have more source material than for any episode\r\nof Ottoman history until the fall of Constantinople.[513]\r\n\r\nThe French chevaliers numbered about a thousand. They were accompanied\r\nby six or seven thousand attendants and mercenaries. They gathered at\r\nDijon, under the command of Jean de Nevers, the oldest son of Duke\r\nPhilip of Burgundy, and grandson of King John, who had been captured in\r\nthe battle of Poitiers. He was only twenty-two, and had just won his\r\nknighthood. The fact, though, that he was heir to Burgundy, and a prince\r\nof the royal blood, gave him the command. Philip charged the Sieur de\r\nCoucy, one of the boldest and most experienced warriors in France, to\r\nhave an eye on the boy, and to guide the expedition with his\r\ncounsel.[514]\r\n\r\nProminent among the French chevaliers were Philippe d’Artois, Constable\r\nof France, Henri and Philippe de Bar, cousins of the king, the Sieur de\r\nCoucy, Guillaume de la Trémouille, Jacques Bourbon de Vienne, admiral of\r\nFrance and prince of the royal blood, Boucicaut, marshal of France, the\r\nSieur de Saint-Pol, and three Flemish princes who were the brothers of\r\nJean de Nevers’s mother. The heir to the duchy of Bavaria was anxious to\r\njoin the French chevaliers, but was restrained by the wise words of Duke\r\nAlbert: ‘William, since you have the desire to travel and go to Hungary\r\nand Turkey, and carry arms against people and countries which have never\r\ndone anything to us, and you have no reason for going there, except the\r\nvainglory of this world, let John of Burgundy and our cousins of France\r\ndo their enterprises, and you do yours, and go into Friesland and\r\nconquer our inheritance ... and in doing this I shall help you.’[515]\r\n\r\nThe chevaliers travelled through Germany and Bohemia, and were\r\nhospitably received by the Duke of Austria. ‘On the way they spoke of\r\nAmorath-Bacquin[516] and admired little his power.’ When they reached ‘a\r\ncity called Buda, the king made them a great reception and good cheer,\r\nand indeed he ought to have done so, for they had come far to see him\r\nand bear arms for him’.[517] At Buda they found the other chevaliers who\r\nhad responded to the invitation of Sigismund, among whom were the\r\nBastard of Savoy,[518] Frederick of Hohenzollern, grand prior of the\r\nTeutonic Order, Philibert de Naillac, grand master of Rhodes, with a\r\ncontingent of chevaliers of Saint-John, the Elector Palatine, and John,\r\nBurgrave of Nürnberg, ancestor of the House of Brandenburg.[519] A\r\nscholarly biographer of Henry IV of England has recorded that he, as\r\nCount of Lancaster, was one of the participants in the Nicopolis\r\nexpedition.[520] This error has found its way into one, at least, of our\r\nmost reliable modern historians.[521] Although the successor of Richard\r\nII was not, as a matter of fact, at Nicopolis,[522] the blood of the\r\nNicopolis crusaders is in the veins of the British royal house, as in\r\nthat of practically every ruling family of Europe.\r\n\r\nSigismund claimed to have been assured by Bayezid that the Osmanlis\r\nwould invade Hungary in the spring of 1396. When there were no signs of\r\nan Ottoman invasion, the crusaders decided that, as Bayezid did not come\r\nto seek them, they had best take advantage of the summer months to go\r\nand find the arch-enemy of Christendom.[523] Arrangements had been made\r\nwith Mircea, voïevode of Wallachia, to break with the Osmanlis and join\r\nthe coalition. Manuel, who had been invited to co-operate with the\r\ninvaders, prepared secretly to declare against Bayezid.[524]\r\n\r\nAccording to the chronicles, the invasion of Bulgaria was rather a\r\npicnic than a serious military operation. This was true, at least, for\r\nthe western chevaliers, who had brought with them wine and women in\r\nplenty. Their baggage contained all the luxuries to which they were\r\naccustomed at home. The French auxiliaries travelled from Buda to the\r\nDanube by way of Transylvania and Wallachia, crossing the Carpathians\r\nthrough the pass between Brassó (Karlstadt) and Sinaia.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarians, following the Danube, spread out into Serbia, pillaging\r\nand murdering the inoffensive Christian population more thoroughly than\r\nOttoman akindjis would have done.[525] In spite of a lack of opposition,\r\nthey persisted in acting as if they were in the enemy’s country. Widin\r\nsurrendered without a struggle, and Orsova after five days.[526] In\r\nSeptember, the armies joined before the fortress of Nicopolis, whose\r\nsurrender to the Osmanlis three years before had marked the\r\ndisappearance of Bulgarian independence. They were destined to go no\r\nfarther.[527]\r\n\r\nFor sixteen days Sigismund and his allies encamped in front of Nicopolis\r\nwithout giving assault.[528] They had no idea of the whereabouts of\r\nBayezid. It was believed among the French (whose ignorance of geography\r\nand of distances equalled ours of modern times) that Bayezid was in\r\nEgypt, gathering a great army of all the Moslem world to oppose the\r\ntriumphant march of the crusaders. One reads in Froissart that Bayezid\r\nwas ‘in Cairo in Babylonia [_sic_] with the sultan to get men’, that he\r\nleft the sultan there and rallied his forces at Alexandria and Damascus,\r\nthat ‘under the command and prayers of the khalif of Bagdad and Asia\r\nMinor’, whose mandate went forth ‘to Persia, to Media, and to Tarsus’,\r\nBayezid received a ‘mass of Saracens and miscreants’, and that in his\r\narmy were ‘people of Tartary, Persia, Media, Syria, Alexandria, and of\r\nmany far-off countries of the miscreants’.[529]\r\n\r\nSigismund made a speech to the chevaliers from western and central\r\nEurope, in which he declared: ‘Let him come or not come, in the summer\r\nwhich will return, if it pleases God, we shall get through the kingdom\r\nof Armenia and shall pass the Bras Saint-George and shall go into Syria\r\nand shall get from the Saracens the gates of Jaffa and Beirut and\r\nseveral other [cities] to go down into Syria, and we shall go to conquer\r\nthe city of Jerusalem and all the Holy Land. And if the Sultan, with all\r\nthe strength he can muster, comes before us, we shall fight him, and\r\nthere will be no going away without the battle, in God’s pleasure.’\r\nFroissart naïvely adds immediately after his report of this speech: ‘But\r\nit turned out very much in another way.’[530]\r\n\r\nIt certainly did. Bayezid, who had been directing the siege of\r\nConstantinople, knew no more about the khalif and the sultan and the\r\n‘far-off countries of the miscreants’ than did Froissart. Neither he nor\r\nhis ancestors had ever had dealings with the Moslem princes of Asia.\r\nPersians, ‘Saracens’ and Egyptians were lacking in his army. He\r\ngathered together his trained warriors, called upon his Christian\r\nvassals for their quotas, and set forth over the well-known route to the\r\nDanube. From several recent campaigns, he and his soldiers were\r\nthoroughly familiar with the country through which they passed, and in\r\nwhich the people were less afraid of him than they were of the\r\nChristians who had come to deliver them. When, after two weeks’ march,\r\nhe pitched his camp near Nicopolis, he was simply returning to a place\r\nwhere twice before the Ottoman arms had been victorious.\r\n\r\nSigismund was dismayed at the prompt appearance of Bayezid with an army\r\nwhich was reported to him in numbers varying from one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand to two hundred thousand. In spite of his brave words to the\r\nchevaliers, Sigismund knew the worth of the Osmanlis as fighting-men,\r\nand that they could not be brushed aside by a few impetuous cavalry\r\ncharges. So he begged Jean de Nevers and his companions to consult with\r\nhim, and to formulate a definite plan of action. He suggested, and won\r\nover to this opinion the Sieur de Coucy, who was the most experienced\r\nwarrior among the chevaliers, that a reconnaissance be made first of all\r\nto determine Bayezid’s position and intentions. Then, if Bayezid was\r\nactually moving to the attack, or on the point of moving, it would be\r\nthe part of wisdom for the westerners to allow the foot-soldiers of\r\nHungary and the Wallachians to sustain the first attack. The valiant\r\nhorsemen and western mercenaries should form a second line, whether it\r\nbe in attack or defence.\r\n\r\nThe chevaliers were furious at this suggestion. Philippe d’Artois, Comte\r\nd’Eu and Grand Constable of France, who knew Sigismund best from longer\r\nassociation with him, suspected him of an attempt to rob the chevaliers\r\nof the glory of defeating Bayezid. ‘Yes, yes,’ he cried, ‘the king of\r\nHungary wants to have the flower of the day and the honour. We have the\r\nadvance-guard, and already has he given it to us. So he wants to take it\r\naway from us and have the first battle. Whoever believes in this, I\r\nshall not.’ Then turning to the chevalier who carried his banner, he\r\ncalled out, ‘Forward banner, in the name of God and of Saint George, for\r\nthey will see me to-day a good chevalier’.[531] This action was\r\ncontagious. Without knowing where the enemy was, without thinking where\r\nor how far they were going, without waiting to agree upon a concerted\r\naction with the bulk of their army, the French, German, and English\r\nnoblemen rushed forward to make the last charge of European chivalry\r\nagainst the followers of Mohammed.\r\n\r\nThe outposts of Bayezid, taken by surprise, were cut down. The Osmanlis\r\nwho surrendered were massacred without mercy. Imagining that they were\r\nwinning a great victory, and that they were breaking through the only\r\nobstacle between them and the Holy Sepulchre, the chevaliers rode to\r\ndeath and disgrace. In the picturesque language of Rabbi Joseph, ‘they\r\nsaid “Aha! aha!”. But their joy was quickly gone, for the horsemen of\r\nBayezid and his hosts and chariots came against them, in battle array,\r\nlike the moon when she is new.’[532]\r\n\r\nThe chevaliers had put all their strength of man and horse into the\r\ncharge. Their swords ran blood. They thought the day was theirs, when\r\nsuddenly they found themselves confronting the army of Bayezid. As was\r\nhis invariable custom, Bayezid had sent out to meet the attack of the\r\nchevaliers, when he heard that they had commenced the battle, his\r\nworthless untrained levies to be cut down by the enemy and exhaust their\r\nstrength. With deliberation he drew his trusted divisions in battle\r\narray in an advantageous position, which he had ample time to choose.\r\nHis soldiers were intact and fresh. The Ottoman bowmen aimed their\r\narrows at the horses of the chevaliers. Unhorsed and quickly surrounded\r\nby sixty thousand soldiers, there was nothing for the proudest warriors\r\nin Europe to do but surrender to the foe whom they had despised.\r\n\r\nAs far as the chevaliers were concerned, the battle was over in three\r\nhours. Jacques Bourbon, admiral of France, lay on the field with the\r\nbanner of Notre-Dame clasped tightly in his hands. Guy de la Trémouille,\r\nPhilippe de Bar, and others of the noblest blood of France, Flanders,\r\nBavaria, and Savoy were killed in the charge. But the greater part of\r\nthe high-born auxiliaries of Sigismund were prisoners in the camp of\r\nBayezid. So handsomely were they accoutred that the Osmanlis believed\r\nthem all to be princes of the Occident, and saved them for Bayezid to\r\ndetermine their fate.[533]\r\n\r\nWhen Sigismund learned that the chevaliers had disregarded his advice,\r\nand had already ridden forth to find the army of Bayezid, he was greatly\r\nworried, for he knew the tactics of Bayezid, and feared the worst. He\r\nsaid to the grand master of Rhodes, ‘We shall lose the day through the\r\ngreat pride and folly of these French: if they had only believed me, we\r\nhad forces in plenty to fight our enemies’.[534]\r\n\r\nFrom a comparison of the chronicles, one does not get a clear idea of\r\nwhat happened after the failure of the assault of the chevaliers. A\r\nbattle in which the bulk of the forces on either side were engaged\r\nundoubtedly followed. But it is impossible to state whether Sigismund\r\nfollowed up the way opened for him through the Ottoman lines by the\r\nFrench charge, or whether the Hungarians and their auxiliaries were on\r\nthe defensive. Froissart and Morosini infer that Sigismund did not\r\nattempt to fight after the failure of the chevaliers, and it was\r\nbelieved in western Europe that the disaster of Nicopolis was due to the\r\nfailure of Sigismund to support the chevaliers rather than to their own\r\nfolly. The Hungarians and their king were bitterly denounced by the\r\nFrench survivors.[535] On the other hand, Schiltberger, who took part in\r\nthe battle, declares that the king of Hungary was advancing in force,\r\nand that Bayezid was preparing to retreat, when the Osmanlis received\r\nsudden and substantial support from the krai of Serbia.[536]\r\n\r\nThe Serbians were so completely under Ottoman control after the battle\r\nof Kossova, that they made no attempt to throw off the yoke of\r\nBayezid.[537] In Asia Minor as in the Balkan peninsula, against the\r\nKaramanians and Tartars as against the crusaders, at Nicopolis as at\r\nAngora, the Serbian auxiliaries were faithful supporters of Bayezid.\r\nNicopolis was certainly won with the aid of the Christians of the Balkan\r\npeninsula. It was not only the Serbian reinforcements which won the day\r\nfor the Osmanlis. As soon as Mircea of Wallachia saw how the battle was\r\ngoing, he quickly withdrew from the field, and got his forces across the\r\nDanube before the panic started.\r\n\r\nWhether the action of Mircea was actuated by treasonable motives or not\r\nis open to debate. He may have honestly believed that it was a case of\r\n_sauve qui peut_. If so, his action was not more reprehensible than that\r\nof Sigismund himself. The future Holy Roman Emperor, who was to play so\r\nimportant a part in the history of Europe during the early decades of\r\nthe fifteenth century, forgot his bold words of the previous week: ‘And\r\nif the Sultan, with all the strength he can muster, comes before us, we\r\nshall fight him, and there will be no going away without the battle, in\r\nGod’s pleasure.’ Sigismund and the grand master of Rhodes hurried to the\r\nDanube, got away in a small boat,[538] and boarded one of the galleys of\r\nMonicego, the Venetian admiral. Abandoning his army and his allies to\r\ntheir fate, the king of Hungary sailed for home. He had the shame, if he\r\nfelt it at all, when passing through the Dardanelles, of seeing the\r\nchevaliers and other prisoners of Nicopolis paraded before his eyes. One\r\nof these prisoners wrote: ‘The Osmanlis took us out of the tower of\r\nGallipoli, and led us to the sea, and one after the other they abused\r\nthe king of Hungary as he passed, and mocked him, and called to him to\r\ncome out of the boat and deliver his people: and this they did to make\r\nfun of him, and skirmished a long time with each other on the sea. But\r\nthey did not do him any harm, and so he went away.’[539]\r\n\r\nSigismund went to Modon, and then back to Hungary. This was the king who\r\nhad boasted that he would not only turn the Osmanlis out of Europe, but\r\nthat he had enough lances to support the sky, should it fall upon his\r\narmy.[540] Although his manhood had been put to the test, and had been\r\nfound wanting, he was saved to play a great, if unenviable, part in the\r\nclosing events of the Middle Ages.[541]\r\n\r\nAfter Sigismund’s escape, his great army, which was to redeem the Holy\r\nSepulchre, fled before the Osmanlis. Those who were not killed, or\r\ndrowned in the Danube, retreated through Wallachia. Froissart describes\r\ngraphically the hardships of the French, German, English, Scotch,\r\nBohemian, and Flemish crusaders in their painful march across the\r\nCarpathian Mountains. The chevaliers could secure a bare sustenance.\r\nTheir pages and men-at-arms were stripped of their clothes and beaten by\r\nthe peasants. It was not until they got into western Hungary that they\r\nfelt themselves safe.[542]\r\n\r\nOn the day following the battle of Nicopolis, Bayezid rode from his camp\r\nto inspect the battle-field.[543] Orders had been given that the bodies\r\nof the nobles who had fallen be put in a place apart from the common\r\ndead, so that the identity of those who had lost their lives might be\r\nascertained. An especial search for the body of Sigismund was ordered.\r\nThe Hungarian king was not among the captives: it did not occur to\r\nBayezid that he had fled. When Bayezid saw how heavy had been his\r\ncasualties, and learned the story of the massacre of prisoners by the\r\nchevaliers after they had ridden through the Ottoman outposts, he could\r\nnot control his anger. A general massacre of the prisoners was ordered.\r\n\r\nOnly because Bayezid hoped for a great ransom for the grandson of the\r\nFrench king was Jean de Nevers saved. There was in the suite of the\r\nComte de Nevers a Picard chevalier who knew a little Turkish. Through\r\nhim Jean was able to communicate with Bayezid, and to save twenty-four\r\nchevaliers who would bring heavy ransom. Among these were the Comte\r\nd’Eu, the Comte de la Marche, the Sieur de Coucy, Henri de Bar, and\r\nBoucicaut. But they were all forced to stand beside Bayezid and watch\r\nthe massacre of their companions.\r\n\r\nBecause of his youth, for none under twenty years was killed,\r\nSchiltberger was spared to leave a description of this terrible\r\nmassacre. ‘Then I saw the lord Hannsen Greiff, who was a noble of\r\nBavaria, and four others, bound with the same cord. When he saw the\r\ngreat revenge that was taking place, he cried with a loud voice, and\r\nconsoled the horse- and foot-soldiers who were standing there to die.\r\n“Stand firm”, he said, “when our blood this day is spilt for the\r\nChristian faith, and we by God’s help shall become the children of\r\nHeaven.” He knelt, and was beheaded together with his companions. Blood\r\nwas spilled from morning until vespers, and when the king’s counsellors\r\nsaw that so much blood was spilled and that still it did not stop, they\r\nrose and fell upon their knees before the king, and entreated him for\r\nthe sake of God that he would forget his rage, that he might not draw\r\ndown upon himself the vengeance of God, as enough blood was already\r\nspilled. He consented, and ordered that they should stop, and that the\r\nrest of the people should be brought together, and from them he took his\r\nshare, and left the rest to his people who had made them prisoners. The\r\npeople that were killed on that day were reckoned at ten thousand\r\nmen.’[544]\r\n\r\nSo ended the last crusade.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nImmediately after the battle, Bayezid sent part of his army across the\r\nDanube to hunt down the fugitives and to punish Mircea. This force was\r\ndefeated by the Wallachians in the plain of Rovine, and withdrew into\r\nBulgaria.[545]\r\n\r\nOther columns mounted the Danube through the Iron Gates, retaking on the\r\nway the fortresses captured by the crusaders, and made a raid into\r\nStyria. Everywhere the akindjis carried fire and death. The country was\r\nlaid waste. Peterwardein was burned, and sixteen thousand Styrians were\r\ncarried off into slavery in Macedonia and Anatolia.[546]\r\n\r\nThis invasion of Hungary made a deep impression upon the Slavic and\r\nTeutonic races, who believed that it was the beginning of a Moslem\r\nconquest of central Europe. The flagellants and the dancing processions\r\nof the plague days of 1348 and 1359 were revived. For a moment, even the\r\nVenetian Senate feared that Bayezid had led in person his army into\r\nHungary, and was engaged in an aggressive movement that might bring the\r\nOsmanlis to the head of the Adriatic.[547]\r\n\r\nBut Bayezid was not carried away by the ease of his victory. He let well\r\nenough alone. For the moment, he had absorbing interests in the ransom\r\nof his prisoners, the developments in the Greek peninsula, the question\r\nof Constantinople, and the temptation to licentious pleasures that had\r\ncome to him with success.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nBayezid announced his victory from the battle-field to the Kadi of\r\nBrusa, and later, from Adrianople, to the Moslem princes of Asia.[548]\r\nTo the Sultan of Egypt and other rulers he sent gifts of prisoners to\r\ncorroborate his letters.[549]\r\n\r\nThe intercession of Jean de Nevers had saved the more illustrious of the\r\nsurviving French chevaliers. They were taken to Brusa. While not treated\r\nroyally, they were allowed to hunt, and were given opportunities to see\r\nthe grandeur of Bayezid.[550] But they were not kept together long. For\r\nsome months, the heir to the Duchy of Burgundy was separated from his\r\ncompanions, and could talk with them only by the special permission of\r\nBayezid. Some of them were sent to Mikhalitch, where Philippe d’Artois,\r\ngrand marshal of France, died.[551] Enguerran de Coucy, worn out with\r\nanxiety for his family and the disgrace that had come to him at the\r\nclose of his brilliant career, soon followed the Comte d’Artois to the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Jacques Helly was sent by Bayezid to Paris to\r\ncommunicate to the Duke of Burgundy and the other relatives of the\r\ncaptives the conditions for their ransom--two hundred thousand pieces of\r\ngold, delivered to Bayezid at Brusa. Froissart describes the feeling\r\naroused at Paris by the first news of the disaster. The stories of the\r\nsurvivors were not believed, and the bearers of bad news narrowly\r\nescaped hanging or drowning. An order of the king’s council forbade any\r\nman to mention Nicopolis. The anxiety of the families of the chevaliers\r\nwas not set at rest until Jacques Helly reached Paris on Christmas\r\nnight, three months after the battle. Only then was it known who had\r\nbeen saved for ransom. What was joy to some was a crushing blow to\r\nothers. Not since the battle of Poitiers had such a calamity come to the\r\nnoble families of France. There was great lamentation throughout the\r\nkingdom. Chief among the mourners was the Duchess of Burgundy, who had\r\nlost her three brothers, and whose son was in the hands of Bayezid.[552]\r\n\r\nWhile Jacques Helly was in France, Marshal Boucicaut was given\r\npermission to go to Constantinople to try to raise the ransom. He spent\r\nthe Lenten season of 1397 there without success.[553] The Duke of\r\nBurgundy resorted to every expedient to raise the enormous sum demanded\r\nby Bayezid. For the ransom of his son ‘great taxes were laid upon all\r\nthe kingdom, and a large amount of money was gathered and transported to\r\nTurkey, which was a great and irreparable loss’.[554] It was not\r\nforgotten for many years. A decade later it was used as one of the\r\nindictments against the Duc d’Orléans, who met his death through the\r\nman he had helped to ransom.[555]\r\n\r\nWhen, a year after the battle of Nicopolis, the money was at last\r\ndelivered to Bayezid through the intermediation of Gattilusio of\r\nMytilene and the Genoese, Venetian, and Cypriote merchants who traded\r\nwith the Osmanlis, Bayezid gave the chevaliers their liberty. To the\r\nComte de Nevers, he said: ‘John, I know well and am informed that you\r\nare in your country a great lord. You are young, and, in the future, I\r\nhope you will be able to recover, with your courage, from the shame of\r\nthis misfortune which has come to you in your first knightly enterprise,\r\nand that, in the desire of getting rid of the reproach and recovering\r\nyour honour, you will assemble your power to come against me and give me\r\nbattle. If I were afraid of that, and wanted to, before your release I\r\nwould make you swear upon your faith and religion that you would never\r\nbear arms against me, nor those who are in your company here. But no:\r\nneither upon you nor any other of those here will I impose this oath,\r\nbecause I desire, when you will have returned to your home and will have\r\nleisure, that you assemble your power and come against me. You will find\r\nme always ready to meet you and your people on the field of battle. And\r\nwhat I say to you, you can say in like manner to those to whom you will\r\nhave the pleasure of speaking about it, because for this purpose was I\r\nborn, to carry arms and always to conquer what is ahead of me.’[556]\r\n\r\nIt is not true, however, as one would suppose and as Froissart records,\r\nthat ‘these lofty words were always remembered by Jean de Nevers and\r\nhis companions so long as they lived’. The French chevaliers went to\r\nRhodes, and then home by way of the Adriatic. The Comte de Nevers took\r\nto himself a title which he had not earned, unless one confuses folly\r\nwith valour. To the end of his days, he was known as _Jean sans Peur_.\r\nHe never burned with a desire to wipe out the disgrace of Nicopolis, but\r\nspent his whole life as a factional leader in the civil wars of France.\r\nAfter a career which continued as ingloriously as it had begun, he was\r\nstabbed to death on the Bridge of Montereau in 1420--tardy vengeance for\r\nhis own openly acknowledged instigation of the murder of the Duc\r\nd’Orléans.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nThere is recorded the capture of Thebes by the Turks in 1363,[557] and\r\nthe surrender of Patras in Thessaly to the Osmanlis in 1381.[558] The\r\nfirst Ottoman army, however, to enter Greece went to the Morea in 1388,\r\nupon the invitation of Theodore Palaeologos, to support his waning power\r\nas despot against the indigenous Greeks and the Frankish lords. The\r\nOsmanlis under Evrenos carried devastation everywhere they went, and did\r\nlittle to help Theodore.[559] They were soon recalled by Murad to\r\nco-operate in the Kossova campaign. When Theodore was hard pressed, in\r\n1391, by Amadeo of Savoy and the Venetians, he turned again to the\r\nOsmanlis. Once more Evrenos came to the Morea, and helped to destroy the\r\ncoast towns.[560]\r\n\r\nAfter the famous council of Ottoman vassals at Serres, in 1395,\r\nTheodore, who was one of the princes summoned by Bayezid to Serres, was\r\ncompelled to sign the cession of Argos and Monembasia to the Osmanlis.\r\nHe was then thrown into prison, and Bayezid contemplated having him\r\nassassinated. But before the cities could be delivered to the Ottoman\r\nemissaries, Theodore escaped, and declared the cession null and\r\nvoid.[561] The first impulse of Bayezid was to send an army upon the\r\nheels of Theodore. This punitive expedition was postponed on account of\r\nthe activity of Sigismund, and the necessity of defending the northern\r\nfrontiers against the Hungarians.[562]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1397, while Bayezid was superintending the construction\r\nof a mosque at Karaferia in Macedonia, he received a visit from the\r\nGreek bishop of Salona, who laid before him a formal accusation of\r\nadultery, sorcery, and oppression against Helena Cantacuzenos, who had\r\nbeen ruling the Duchy of Salona with her paramour after the death of her\r\nhusband, Louis Fadrique. The bishop invited Bayezid to enter Greece,\r\ndepicting to him the wonderful hunting he would have in a country full\r\nof game.[563]\r\n\r\nThe promise of good sport with the falcon was not needed. It had long\r\nbeen Bayezid’s intention to extend his sovereignty into the Greek\r\npeninsula. He had against Theodore not only the old count from Serres,\r\nbut also the complicity of the Morean despot in the Nicopolis crusade.\r\nAt the head of his army, he set out upon the first Ottoman invasion of\r\nGreece. In Thessaly, Larissa, Pharsala, and other strongholds\r\nsurrendered without striking a blow. For thirty years the Greeks of\r\nThessaly had felt that the Ottoman conquest was inevitable. When\r\nBayezid crossed the pass of Thermopylae without opposition, Helena\r\nhurried to meet him. She offered her principality, her daughter, and\r\nherself to the conqueror. Bayezid did not want the duchess. She was set\r\nat liberty immediately. But the beautiful grand-daughter of John\r\nCantacuzenos was sent to his harem. The duchy of Salona, in which was\r\nthe shrine of Apollo, with all of Phocis, Doris, and Locris, was added\r\nto Thessaly, and made an Ottoman province.[564]\r\n\r\nBayezid by this time had tired of the campaign. He felt an irresistible\r\ncall to return to the pleasures of the court. His military interests\r\nwere beginning more and more to be centred upon an extension of his\r\npower in Asia Minor--the policy that was soon to prove his undoing. But\r\nthere remained Theodore and the Morea to be dealt with. He left Yakub\r\nand Evrenos, with an army of fifty thousand, in charge of the invasion\r\nof the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nYakub struck south to Coron and Modon. The environs of Modon were\r\npillaged and burned. He defeated Theodore at Megalopolis, and forced him\r\nto become a tributary of the Osmanlis. In the meantime, Evrenos had held\r\nin check the papal mercenaries at Corinth, and had then taken Argos by\r\nassault, with a terrible loss of life, and a booty of fourteen thousand\r\nmale captives. Because the Venetians could so easily reinforce and\r\nreprovision it from the sea, the siege of Nauplia was abandoned. The two\r\ncommanders, when October came, gave their soldiers licence to pillage\r\nwherever they could as a reward for their services, and afterwards\r\nwithdrew to Macedonia.[565]\r\n\r\nThe population of the historic city of Argos was deported into Anatolia,\r\nand Moslem colonies settled in the north-eastern corner of the\r\nPeloponnesus. This was part of the general plan of Bayezid after\r\nNicopolis. His successes in Asia Minor had made possible, for the first\r\ntime, a movement of an unmixed Turkish element from Anatolia into the\r\nBalkan peninsula. While these colonists were arriving in Argos, there\r\nwas a similar immigration to Adrianople, Eski Zagora, Philippopolis, and\r\nSofia.[566]\r\n\r\nBayezid is credited by the Ottoman chroniclers with the capture of the\r\ntwo great cities of Hellenism, Athens and Salonika. Nowhere else than in\r\nthe Ottoman historians can one find a record of the acquisition of\r\nAthens in 1397 by the Osmanlis. If it were true, one would certainly\r\nfind this event in the Venetian archives, for Venice was particularly\r\ninterested in Athens at this time.[567] Had the Osmanlis entered Athens,\r\nwould they have restored it to the Acciajoli family? The fate of Argos\r\nin the same campaign makes this unlikely. Athens remained in Christian\r\nhands until after the fall of Constantinople.[568]\r\n\r\nAs for Salonika, one finds authority for its capture by the Osmanlis\r\nafter the attempt of Manuel to retake Serres,[569] after a four years’\r\nsiege, in 1387,[570] and in 1391 by Bayezid himself.[571] But since\r\nthere is neither record nor explanation of how the city returned to the\r\nByzantines, even the temporary occupation of so rich and important a\r\nmaritime city, and so strongly defended,[572] during the reigns of Murad\r\nand of Bayezid, is hardly possible. For in 1403 Salonika was sold by the\r\nByzantines to the Venetians,[573] and was not captured by the Osmanlis\r\nuntil 1430.\r\n\r\nEven if we cannot give to Bayezid the honour of the acquisition of\r\nAthens and Salonika, or of the conquest of the Morea, his campaign of\r\n1397 was the beginning of the subjugation of Greece. Important districts\r\nhad been added to the empire, and a permanent foothold gained in the\r\nMorea. The maritime character of the peninsula, however, made\r\nimpracticable its complete conquest, until the Osmanlis were able to\r\nhold their own against the Italians and Greeks upon the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nThe blockade of Constantinople, in spite of all the concessions that\r\nManuel had made to Bayezid,[574] had become an active and pressing siege\r\nbefore the Nicopolis expedition. In 1394, Bayezid had given orders from\r\nAdrianople to pursue the siege vigorously.[575] But it was not until the\r\nspring of 1396 that Bayezid contemplated seriously the taking of the\r\ncity by assault. He was diverted by the coming of the crusaders to\r\nNicopolis. After Sigismund and his allies had been defeated, Bayezid\r\nreturned to Constantinople and called upon Manuel to surrender the city.\r\n\r\nThe Constantinopolitans, stunned by the disaster which had attended the\r\nChristian arms on the Danube, urged Manuel to yield, in order that they\r\nmight be free from the calamities that would follow a successful\r\nassault. But Manuel had been cheered by the arrival of six hundred\r\nchevaliers and a small gift of money from France. He resisted his\r\npeople, and gave no answer to Bayezid.[576] He married his eldest son\r\nJohn to the daughter of the Russian prince Vassili, whose dowry was in\r\ngold pieces.[577] An inventory was made of the treasures of St.\r\nSophia.[578] Through the Patriarch, Manuel tried to get the Russian and\r\nPolish Christians interested in the fate of the seat of orthodoxy.[579]\r\n\r\nFrom Europe came the usual promises of aid. It is a merciful\r\ndispensation of Providence that men ground their hopes upon desires\r\nrather than upon realities. Manuel was merely human when he continued to\r\nreceive strength and inspiration from what experience should have taught\r\nhim were will-o’-the-wisps. Henry of Lancaster was projecting a new\r\ncrusade;[580] but his energies were very soon directed towards a crown\r\nrather than a cross. The Duc d’Orléans, in response to a letter from\r\nManuel to King Charles VI, answered for his insane brother by promising\r\nto come in person to the relief of Constantinople. Almost immediately\r\nafterwards he accepted rich presents from Bayezid.[581]\r\n\r\nVenice, in 1397, urged Manuel and the Genoese of Pera, ‘for the honour\r\nof Christianity’ and because the alternative ‘would be to the peril and\r\nshame of Christianity’, not to treat with Bayezid. This advice was\r\nweakened by a saving clause at the end of the letter to the effect that,\r\nif the Constantinopolitans and Perotes did treat with Bayezid, they\r\nshould include Venice, for ‘it would be too risky for the Venetians to\r\nbe at war alone with the Turks’.[582] Although Venice sent ten galleys\r\nto Constantinople, and Genoa five galleys,[583] the republics followed\r\nconsistently their policy of flattering Bayezid, and trying to make him\r\nbelieve that their dispositions towards him were altogether\r\nfriendly.[584]\r\n\r\nAt the time that he summoned Manuel to deliver Constantinople, Bayezid\r\nfortified the gulf of Nicomedia, and built at Scutari the castle called\r\nGuzel Hissar.[585] About the same time, the castle of Anatoli Hissar was\r\nbuilt at the mouth of the Sweet Waters of Asia, the narrowest point on\r\nthe Bosphorus. When Clavijo passed through the Bosphorus, in 1403, he\r\nspoke of this castle as strongly built and strongly fortified, in\r\nprophetic contrast to the ruined Byzantine fortress directly opposite on\r\nthe European shore.[586]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was because of the advice of Ali Pasha, who told him that the\r\ntaking of Constantinople would bring upon him a really effective\r\nEuropean intervention, or because he preferred to expend his energies in\r\nthe Greek peninsula and in Asia Minor, that Bayezid did not carry out\r\nhis threat to Manuel. These are the common explanations of the failure\r\nto follow up the victory of Nicopolis with the extinction of the\r\nByzantine Empire.[587] As far as the Greeks were concerned, the\r\ninheritance of the Caesars was his. He had successfully defended against\r\nEurope what he had won. Constantinople could have been taken by assault.\r\nIn fact, from his spies within the city, Bayezid knew that the\r\ninhabitants were favourable to surrender, and would probably force the\r\nhand of Manuel, if the Osmanlis made a show of beginning the assault.\r\nBayezid must have been deterred from this enterprise, however, by the\r\nrealization of his inability to hold the city without having the mastery\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nOne of Bayezid’s chief claims to greatness as a statesman is the way in\r\nwhich he handled Venice and Genoa. At any time during his reign, the\r\nItalian republics could have cut him off from Asia if he were in Europe,\r\nor from Europe if he were in Asia. Bayezid was master of most of the\r\nBalkan peninsula and of half of Anatolia; but he did not control the\r\npath from one portion of his empire to the other. Since he had come to\r\nthe throne, Genoa had fallen under the influence of France. There was a\r\nstrong anti-Ottoman sentiment in the Venetian Senate, which at any\r\ninstant might crystallize into open hostility.[588] Europe was for the\r\nmoment stirred over the fate of the Nicopolis crusaders. Bayezid knew\r\nthat this was not the time to take Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThen, too, after the great victories of Kossova and Nicopolis, and his\r\nsuccessful campaign against Karamania, Bayezid allowed himself to\r\nsuccumb to the insidious temptations that assail the warrior when he\r\npasses from the tent to the palace. It was not astonishing that the\r\npleasures of the table and of the harem proved irresistible to him.\r\nBayezid, who had the best qualities of his age, allowed himself to\r\nbecome debauched by indulgence in shameful and unspeakable vices. His\r\nbrilliant mental and physical qualities began to suffer the inevitable\r\neclipse. His example was contagious. For, as the Osmanlis say, ‘the fish\r\nbegins to corrupt at the head’.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nIn April 1398, and again in March 1399, Boniface IX ordered to be\r\npreached throughout Christendom a crusade for the defence of\r\nConstantinople.[589] His appeals fell on deaf ears. Wenceslaus was\r\napproaching the end of his power in the empire, Richard of England was\r\nfighting for his throne, Florence was in a struggle with the Visconti,\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy and the Duke of Orleans were disputing the regency\r\nin France. Only Venice and Genoa were vitally interested in the fate of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nBecause Genoa had put itself under the guardianship of the Duke of\r\nOrleans, brother of Charles VI of France, and son-in-law of Duke\r\nGiovanni Visconti of Milan, the interests of her Pera colony demanded\r\nsome attention from the powerful Valois and Visconti families. This made\r\npossible the sole response to the appeals of Manuel and the Pope, the\r\nexpedition of Marshal Boucicaut.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1399, a force of ten thousand Osmanlis, after coming\r\ninto more or less open conflict with the Genoese of Galata, attempted to\r\nenter Constantinople. The defenders were few; for the inhabitants, as at\r\nthe time of the final siege in 1453, were more likely to be found in the\r\nbazaars than on the city walls. They had little desire to prolong a\r\ncondition which was paralysing their business activities. Clavijo, who\r\nvisited Constantinople four years later, was informed that the attack\r\nfailed only because of the lack of skill and energy shown by the\r\nOsmanlis.[590] Until they had cannon to help them, the Osmanlis never\r\ndisplayed fighting ability in an assault upon fortifications. At this\r\ncritical moment, aid arrived from Europe.\r\n\r\nBoucicaut was the only one of the prisoners of Nicopolis that accepted\r\nthe challenge of Bayezid. He did not forget the biting words of the\r\naudience at Brusa at the time of their release. On June 26, 1399, with\r\nfour ships and two armed galleys, he set sail from Aiguesmortes. His\r\nforce of twelve hundred chevaliers and foot-soldiers had much more\r\ncohesion and experience than the volunteers who gathered round Jean de\r\nNevers at Dijon three years before. He was joined at Tenedos by several\r\nGenoese and Venetian galleys. After a victory in the Dardanelles over\r\nseventeen Ottoman galleys, the first recorded naval combat of the\r\nOsmanlis, Boucicaut reached Constantinople ‘just in time to save the\r\ncity’. He was received with great joy by Manuel, and given the rank of\r\nGrand Constable.[591]\r\n\r\nFor several weeks, Boucicaut and his followers spread terror among the\r\nOsmanlis in the Gulf of Nicomedia and the Bosphorus. The Ottoman\r\nsailors, no match for the Provençals and Italians, took to cover. An\r\nassault on Nicomedia failed, but the fearless marshal made several raids\r\ninto the interior,[592] and against the Ottoman settlements on the\r\nshores of the Marmora and gulfs of Nicomedia and Mudania. His one\r\nnotable success was against Riva, near the Black Sea entrance of the\r\nBosphorus, on the Asiatic shore.[593] After the castle had been stormed,\r\nand the garrison put to the sword, Boucicaut attained the objective of\r\nhis raid. In the mouth of the river Riva, from which the town takes its\r\nname, were hidden the Ottoman galleys and smaller vessels, which had\r\ntaken refuge there when Boucicaut first appeared in the Golden Horn. All\r\nthe Ottoman shipping was destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nIn order to remove the danger to which Constantinople was subjected by\r\nthe presence of John Palaeologos, son of Andronicus, at Silivria,\r\nconstantly intriguing with the Osmanlis, Boucicaut urged Manuel to\r\nbecome reconciled with his nephew. He went, himself--it was less than a\r\nday’s sail--to fetch John to Constantinople.[594]\r\n\r\nThis intervention of Boucicaut in the quarrels of the Palaeologi was\r\nmore helpful than his military aid. The expeditions in the neighbourhood\r\naccomplished little against Bayezid. The chronicler of Boucicaut would\r\nhave been astonished had he known that Bayezid considered the exploits\r\nof Boucicaut’s chevaliers and sailors of too little importance to\r\nnotice. Bayezid cared only that the Italian republics did not come out\r\nopenly against him, and lend to the crusaders the powerful and decisive\r\naid which they could have given. The enterprise of Boucicaut\r\ndemonstrated, however, the impotence of the Osmanlis on sea, and how\r\neasily a united effort of Christendom, or of Venice and Genoa alone,\r\ncould have limited the activities of Bayezid to either Europe or Asia.\r\n\r\nWhen John had been installed as co-emperor, Boucicaut pointed out to\r\nManuel that his force was exhausted, and that he would have to return to\r\nFrance to find recruits. According to some authorities, this action was\r\ndue to the inability or unwillingness of Manuel to pay the adventurers\r\nof Boucicaut for their services in his behalf.[595] Men of their kidney\r\nwere not fighting for fun or for a cause, and there was no booty to be\r\nhad from Ottoman sailors and fishermen. Before he left Constantinople,\r\nBoucicaut secured the consent of Venice, Genoa, and the chevaliers of\r\nRhodes to his suggestion that Manuel do homage to Charles VI for his\r\nempire. This honour the advisers of the French monarch refused to\r\naccept. They did not want the king of France bound by the obligation of\r\nprotecting a vassal whose position was so precarious.\r\n\r\nBoucicaut did not return. His restless energy found outlet later in\r\nCyprus, where, as French governor of Genoa, he forced the Cypriotes to\r\nraise the siege of Famagusta,[596] and in pillaging the Syrian ports,\r\nwhere his adventurers did far more damage to the Italian merchants than\r\nto the Saracens.[597] Even had he returned to Constantinople, and with\r\nthe highest motives personally, his followers would certainly have done\r\nthe Constantinopolitans more harm than good, as had been the case with\r\nthe Catalans, and, when money was not forthcoming, have ended by being\r\nin open conflict with those of whom they were posing as the defenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter humiliation for Manuel to share the imperial throne with\r\nthe nephew whom he hated and distrusted. With him, the case of John was\r\none of ‘like father, like son’, and certainly John had never given the\r\nemperor any cause to think that he was more patriotic, more loyal than\r\nAndronicus. But there was a strong party in the city in favour of John,\r\nand his association in governing Constantinople would remove the pretext\r\nof righting a wrong, which Bayezid had so skilfully used to interfere in\r\nthe politics of what was now no more than a city empire.\r\n\r\nWhen France refused to receive him as a vassal, Manuel decided upon a\r\nvoyage in person to solicit the intervention of Europe. In spite of his\r\nmisgivings, he felt that this was the only way of salvation left. His\r\nown sons were too young to raise to the purple, and Theodore had his\r\nhands full in the Morea. There was nothing to do but to leave the\r\ngovernment in John’s care.\r\n\r\nOn December 10, 1399, Manuel embarked on a Venetian galley to make his\r\nsupreme appeal to Europe. He stopped at Modon to leave the empress and\r\nhis sons with Theodore. The despot of the Morea was opposed to the\r\nproject. He told the emperor how the chevaliers of Rhodes, in\r\nconjunction with the Pope, were trying to get possession of the last\r\ntheme of the empire, and that this scheme would have been successful had\r\nit not been for the Greek hatred and fear of the Catholic Church. He\r\ndeclared that Manuel, like their father, was embarking upon a hopeless\r\nvoyage. Not only that, but he would run a risk of losing his empire\r\nentirely by leaving it in charge of John, who was more friendly to\r\nBayezid and the Osmanlis than to his own family and race.[598]\r\n\r\nManuel would listen to no remonstrances, to no arguments. He said that\r\nhis position was like that of Esther before she went in to the king: ‘If\r\nI perish, I perish.’ With that optimism which was one of his most\r\nredeeming traits, Manuel bade farewell to his family, and set out for\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nIn the only city of Europe that could rival his own capital in\r\nsplendour, he received a reception worthy of the cause for which he had\r\ncome. The Senate, as usual, promised much. But they had by this time\r\nbecome thoroughly won over to the policy of _quod vi armorum potest\r\nfieri, fiat arte et sagacitate_, to quote the words of a contemporary\r\nrecord in their archives.[599] At Padua, Vicenza, and Milan, Manuel\r\nreceived an imperial ovation. Giovanni Visconti, shocked at the wretched\r\nappearance of the emperor’s suite, gave him money to be used for apparel\r\nfitting to the successor of Constantine and his companions.[600]\r\n\r\nThere was no attempt to arrange a conference with Boniface IX. Manuel,\r\nat this stage of his career, could not play the hypocrite so easily as\r\nhis father had done. In fact, his orthodoxy was beyond suspicion. He did\r\nnot hesitate in Paris to celebrate high mass according to the eastern\r\nrite, and never allowed the reunion of the churches to be the basis of\r\nhis solicitations. In 1399, Boniface IX wrote a long burning letter to\r\nthe Bishop of Chalcedon, his nuncio in Hungary, ordering him to preach\r\nand cause to be preached a crusade against the Osmanlis for the relief\r\nof Constantinople.[601] In 1400, he had ordered a crusade, with increase\r\nof indulgences.[602] But, when the Byzantine Emperor came to Italy,\r\nBoniface seemed to be more interested in the Kingdom of Naples than in\r\nthe Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nFrom contemporary records, the reception of Manuel Palaeologos in France\r\nand in England was all that the proudest and most important sovereign of\r\nChristendom could wish for. This shadow of an emperor, who ten years\r\nbefore had been a retainer at the court of Bayezid too insignificant to\r\nbe bidden to the emir’s table, and who was not even undisputed ruler of\r\na single city, was treated by Charles VI and Henry IV as if he actually\r\nheld the dominions entrusted by Constantine to his successors. This was\r\nespecially true in England, where barons and peasants, in spite of the\r\ncrusades, were still uncouth and ignorant. To them the East stood for a\r\nsuperior civilization, to which they must bow. There was a glamour in\r\nthe name of Constantinople and in Manuel’s imperial title. Perhaps, even\r\nif they had realized the straits to which Manuel was reduced, it would\r\nhave been the same; for it was not to the intrinsic worth or power of\r\nthe man, but to the ten centuries of glory which he represented, that\r\nthey did homage. The cry of AVE IMPERATOR had outlived the empire.\r\n\r\nManuel did not appreciate this. Because his optimism could not grasp\r\nthe difference between what costs and what does not cost, he allowed\r\nhimself to be cradled with false hopes for two years.\r\n\r\nHenry IV had personally great sympathy with the mission of Manuel; for\r\nin Africa he had borne arms against the Moslems with the cross upon his\r\nbreast, and, until he succeeded Richard II, it had always been his dream\r\nto lead a crusade. He understood the peril of Constantinople, and in a\r\nletter from Westminster, in January, 1401, he called the attention of\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury to the necessity of helping Manuel, in\r\norder that Constantinople might not be lost, and authorized a collection\r\nin all the churches of his realm.[603] But Henry was not secure upon his\r\nthrone. In France, the Dukes of Burgundy and Orleans were still\r\nstruggling for the power that the insane king was unable to wield.\r\n\r\nManuel waited two years in western Europe. While he was making his heart\r\nsick with deferred hope, the great events that were to change the\r\npersonal fortune of Bayezid, if not that of his family and his race,\r\nwere shaping themselves in the East. It was a Moslem prince who was to\r\nafford a respite to Constantinople.\r\n\r\nAfter Manuel left for the west, only the small force of chevaliers under\r\nChâteaumorand, who had remained behind from the crusaders of Boucicaut,\r\nsaved Constantinople. The inhabitants of the city were so hungry that\r\nthey slipped over the walls by cords, and surrendered themselves to the\r\nOsmanlis. John did nothing. There was no money in the imperial treasury.\r\nThe crusaders got their own provisions by raids on the Asiatic shore of\r\nthe Bosphorus, and by intercepting galleys. After the shock of the fall\r\nof Sivas, Bayezid realized that he must expend the best of his force and\r\nenergy in solidifying his conquests in Europe and Asia, and in raising a\r\nlarger army to combat Timur, if he threatened again to invade Anatolia.\r\n\r\nAlthough the siege was not pushed with vigour, the city was on the point\r\nof yielding. The miserable John made a treaty to give up the city,\r\nshould Bayezid beat Timur.[604] Even the patriarch Matthew was supposed\r\nto have an understanding with Bayezid to retain his position if the city\r\nwere taken. In a proclamation, which vividly depicted the misery of the\r\ncity, afflicted by six years of siege and famine, Matthew urged the\r\ninhabitants to repent of their crimes, and defended himself from the\r\ncharge of having treated with Bayezid.[605]\r\n\r\nNot only against Constantinople was Bayezid preparing the final blow. In\r\nthe Morea, the Greeks feared for the safety of Modon, where Manuel had\r\nleft his family.[606] Since 1399, the Venetian Senate had been alarmed\r\nby the gradual Ottoman conquest of Albania, and finally for the safety\r\nof Corfu, because the Osmanlis had appeared in force in the\r\nAdriatic.[607]\r\n\r\nIn the early spring of 1402, Ottoman activities ceased in the Balkan\r\npeninsula, and every soldier that could be mustered--Christian as well\r\nas Moslem--was hurried into Asia Minor; for a greater than Djenghiz Khan\r\nwas marching westward.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nWhen the Tartars first saw iron, and their strongest warriors failed to\r\nbend it, they thought there must be a substance under the surface. So\r\nthey called it _timur_, which means something stuffed or filled.[608] It\r\nsoon became a custom to name their great leaders Timur. But even among\r\nprimitive peoples the qualities of leadership have not necessarily\r\nincluded purely physical strength. Many Samsons among the Tartars\r\nreceived the distinction of being called Iron. None of them made an\r\nindelible mark upon the history of the world, save the great Timur, who\r\nhad his left arm and left leg partially paralysed.[609] At the height of\r\nhis career, when his hordes marched against Bagdad, he was too weak to\r\nsit upon a horse, and was carried in a litter.[610]\r\n\r\nTimur claimed descent from the grand vizier of Djagataï, son and\r\nsuccessor of Djenghiz Khan. He came to the throne of Khorassan, with\r\nresidence at Samarkand, in 1369. In thirty years, while Murad and\r\nBayezid were winning an empire in the Balkan peninsula, Timur became\r\nmaster of the greater part of the Moslem world. Persia, Armenia, the\r\nupper valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, the steppes between the\r\nCaspian and Black Seas, Russia from the Volga to the Don and Dnieper,\r\nMesopotamia, the coasts of the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf, and\r\nwestern and northern India was his path of conquest.\r\n\r\nAfter he had captured Sivas, Bayezid had not been able to curb the\r\naltogether natural impulse that led him into the valley of the\r\nEuphrates. In his way stood Kara-Yussuf, a Turcoman prince of Kharput,\r\nwho was to be, after Timur’s death, the founder of the famous dynasty of\r\nthe Black Sheep.[611] In 1399, Bayezid had put his son Soleiman,\r\nassisted by several of his ablest generals, in charge of an advance\r\nmovement to the east. Sivas was the base of operations.\r\n\r\nKara-Yussuf, who had a claim upon Timur’s protection because he had\r\nguided him on his first expedition into Armenia, appealed to the Tartar\r\ncourt. Before Timur could remonstrate, Kara-Yussuf was captured by the\r\nOsmanlis. When Timur learned this, his anger was for the first time\r\ndirected specifically against Bayezid. There were old complaints against\r\nBayezid. The refugee emirs had not lived at his court for years without\r\nimpressing upon Timur their woes and the injustice that had been done to\r\nthem. But Timur was busy with other plans and other conquests. Bayezid’s\r\nformer activities had not directly touched him.\r\n\r\nIn his memoirs, Timur records that he tried first to bring Bayezid to\r\nreason. ‘I wrote to him a letter of which this is the substance: Praise\r\nto God, master of heaven and earth, who has submitted to my authority\r\nseveral of the seven climates and who has allowed the potentates and\r\nmasters of the world to bend their neck under my yoke. God have mercy\r\nupon his humble servant, who knows the limits which are prescribed for\r\nhim and who does not cross them by a single step. All the world knows\r\nyour origin, and it is not fitting for a man of your extraction to\r\nadvance the foot of pride; for you will be able to throw yourself into\r\nthe abyss of affliction and of misfortune: resist the suggestions of\r\nmiserable counsellors.... Refrain from opening to confusion and to evils\r\nthe door of your empire. Send me Kara-Yussuf: if not, by the coming\r\ntogether of our two armies all that is hidden under the veil of destiny\r\nwill be uncovered to you.’[612]\r\n\r\nInstead of paying attention to this letter, Bayezid deliberately\r\ncommitted another overt act by summoning Taharten, emir of Erzindjian,\r\nwhom he knew to be a vassal of Timur, to appear at the Ottoman court,\r\nbringing his treasures with him! When Timur again remonstrated with\r\nBayezid and reminded him of his duty ‘gently and like a friend’, Bayezid\r\nresponded by summoning Timur to appear before him, and threatening to\r\ndeprive him of his harem if he refused to come. In order to express his\r\ncontempt for the Tartar conqueror, Bayezid placed his own name first in\r\nletters of gold, and Timur’s name underneath in small black\r\nletters.[613]\r\n\r\nWhy Bayezid took this tack in dealing with Timur is inexplicable. It is\r\nimpossible to believe that he underrated the power of Timur. One can\r\nonly suppose that his informants and advisers, to whom Timur alluded in\r\nthe first warning to Bayezid, urged upon the Ottoman emir the\r\nimprobability of a Tartar invasion of Asia Minor; for, even after the\r\nterrible lesson of 1400, when Bayezid had two years of respite, he took\r\nno steps to placate Timur or to prepare adequately against an invasion.\r\nHe went on blindly to his doom, and displayed none of the consummate\r\ndiplomatic and military skill that had made the first eight years of his\r\nreign among the most brilliant of all Ottoman history.\r\n\r\nWhen Timur saw that Bayezid would not even treat with him, he took the\r\nfield immediately. Soleiman sent an appeal to Bayezid, who was in\r\nThessaly.[614] There was no response. With feverish haste, Soleiman\r\nattempted to put into condition the defences of Sivas, whose strong\r\nwalls had been admirably constructed by the Seljuk Sultan Alaeddin\r\nKaïkobad\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIMUR’S INVASION OF ASIA MINOR]\r\n\r\none hundred and sixty years before.[615] He then went boldly forth to\r\nmeet the Tartars, but, when he realized that his twenty thousand\r\nhorsemen could not hold their own against Timur, he withdrew to the\r\nnorth-west, abandoning the city to its fate.[616]\r\n\r\nIt took Timur eighteen days of incessant attack to weaken the defences\r\nof Sivas. The walls were sapped, and piles driven under them, which were\r\nsmeared with pitch and set on fire. Only after several of the towers had\r\nfallen did the garrison agree to surrender upon Timur’s promise that\r\ntheir lives should be spared and the whole city preserved. As far as the\r\nMoslems were concerned, this promise was partially fulfilled. They were\r\nallowed to pay for their freedom. The city, however, was pillaged and\r\nburned, and its Christian inhabitants were sold into slavery. Three or\r\nfour thousand Armenian horsemen, who had been bravest and most stubborn\r\nin the defence, were buried alive in the moats.[617]\r\n\r\nThe destruction of Sivas was in August, 1400.[618] The conduct of Timur\r\nafter this victory lends colour to the supposition that it was not at\r\nall in his mind to subdue Asia Minor and overthrow the Ottoman Empire.\r\nHe had come not to conquer, but merely to give Bayezid a salutary\r\nlesson. Instead of continuing his westward march, Timur withdrew to the\r\nEuphrates, and spent the next eighteen months in the famous campaigns\r\nthat ended in the destruction of Damascus and Bagdad.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1401-2, fresh from his triumphs in Syria and\r\nMesopotamia, Timur paused for several months on the confines of Asia\r\nMinor. He had not yet made up his mind to attack Bayezid.\r\n\r\nThrough a Dominican friar, who had been trying to convert him, he wrote\r\nto Charles VI of France, whom he believed to be the most powerful king\r\nof the Occident, making to him a proposal for sharing the world, such as\r\nno European sovereign had put before him again until Alexander met\r\nNapoleon on the raft at Tilsit.[619] There was also an exchange of gifts\r\nand embassies with Genoa. The Genoese ambassador pointed out to Timur\r\nthe necessity of destroying Bayezid. When the Tartar embassy went to\r\nPera, the standard of Timur was flown in its honour from the Galata\r\ntower.[620] Even the distant king of Castile had two ambassadors in the\r\ncamp of Timur, who were privileged to witness the battle of Angora from\r\nthe Tartar side.[621]\r\n\r\nThe fall of Sivas was the first set-back of Bayezid’s career. It came to\r\nhim as a heavy blow, if we are to believe the Ottoman chroniclers. But\r\nit did not result in spurring him on to immediate military and\r\ndiplomatic effort, as such a calamity would certainly have done in the\r\nearly days of his reign. He had become a voluptuary, debauched mentally\r\nand physically. His pride and self-confidence had increased in inverse\r\nratio to his ability to make good his arrogant assumptions.\r\n\r\nNegotiations were reopened between the two great sovereigns of Islam.\r\nThe letters became more menacing on the part of Timur and more insulting\r\non the part of Bayezid.[622] Timur’s earlier admiration for Bayezid as\r\nchampion of the Prophet against the infidels, and his earlier reluctance\r\nto make war against a nation of his own faith, had disappeared in the\r\ncourse of his last conquests. The fire at Damascus was one indication of\r\nTimur’s religious indifference: his willingness to treat with Christian\r\nEurope was another. At last determined to humble Bayezid, Timur brought\r\nhis huge army into camp near Sivas. He did not, however, definitely\r\ndecide upon the invasion of Ottoman territory until he heard that\r\nBayezid was starting for Tokat.\r\n\r\nTo strike at Bayezid directly was impracticable, owing to the hardships\r\nthat his large army would encounter in traversing the thickly wooded and\r\nmountainous country between him and the region in which his spies\r\nreported the Ottoman army to be. He followed the valley of the Halys to\r\nCaesarea. By keeping to the water-courses his army was enabled to live\r\noff the land. It was just harvest time, and the soldiers gathered in all\r\nthe grain in the valley of the Halys and its tributaries. It took six\r\ndays to get to Caesarea, and four days more to reach Kirsheïr. In the\r\nmeantime, the advance guard of the Osmanlis had fallen back from Tokat\r\nand Amassia to Angora. By a reconnaissance from Kirsheïr, Timur learned\r\nthat the bulk of the Ottoman forces were at Angora. Three days more\r\nbrought him to the Ottoman outposts.[623]\r\n\r\nThere was no further parley. Timur saw in Bayezid an enemy that must be\r\ncrushed. He had every confidence in his star. Bayezid had hardly\r\nrecovered from the awakening which came when he realized that Timur was\r\nactually marching against him. His resourcefulness, his coolness, his\r\nmarvellous judgement had left him. His soldiers were exhausted by forced\r\nmarches in the hot midsummer sun, for it was the last week of July.[624]\r\nHe could have withdrawn for several days to the mountains to recuperate,\r\nand let Timur do the seeking. Then Timur would have expended his\r\nstrength in an attack upon Angora under the broiling sun. Timur could\r\nnot have left Angora uncaptured behind him, or have moved westward in\r\npursuit of the Osmanlis without waiting to replenish his food supply.\r\nBut Bayezid, eager and lacking in self-control, as men sometimes are\r\nfrom the presentiment of disaster rather than the confidence of success,\r\ndecided upon an immediate battle. This was just what Timur wanted.\r\n\r\nBayezid’s second mistake was in putting his Tartar allies in the first\r\nline. He did this in accordance with the established Ottoman tactics,\r\nthat the enemy be allowed to expend his strength upon the untrained\r\nrabble, and to reach the second line exhausted. But he had not taken\r\ninto consideration the fact that these Tartars were kin to his enemy,\r\nand could easiest desert when placed in front.[625] A third mistake was\r\nin taking the offensive rather than waiting for Timur to attack;[626]\r\nfor Bayezid had the advantage in being able to choose his position. From\r\nNicopolis to Plevna, Tchataldja and Gallipoli, the Osmanlis have always\r\nshown their fighting qualities best in a defensive action.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing the matter with Bayezid’s army. Like the empire he had\r\nbeen building, it was composed of all the Moslem and Christian elements\r\nof Asia Minor and the Balkan peninsula. With the exception of the\r\nTartars, they were loyal to Bayezid, and had become accustomed to\r\nfighting together with a discipline and bravery fully equal to, if not\r\nsuperior to, that of Timur’s veteran warriors from central Asia. The\r\nright wing was under Stephen Lazarevitch, brother-in-law and faithful\r\nfriend of Bayezid. In addition to Serbian horsemen, Stephen’s command\r\ncontained the other European contingents, Moslem as well as\r\nChristian.[627] In the left wing were the troops of Anatolia, led by\r\nSoleiman Tchelebi, Bayezid’s eldest son. The emir himself was in the\r\ncentre, surrounded by his janissaries and his three sons, Mustafa, Isa,\r\nand Musa. To Mohammed, whose reliability and judgement Bayezid esteemed\r\nsecond only to Soleiman’s among his sons, was entrusted the rear\r\nguard.[628]\r\n\r\nElephants were used on both sides. Timur’s first line threw balls of\r\nGreek fire into the midst of the archers who were covering the Ottoman\r\nadvance. The desertion of the Tartar auxiliaries, who formed a quarter\r\nor more of Bayezid’s total strength, decided the battle before the\r\nfighting really started.[629] When Bayezid saw that he could not prevent\r\nthe Tartars from going over to Timur, he ordered the left wing to\r\nadvance to the attack.\r\n\r\nFifteen thousand men fell in a vain effort to pierce the Tartar lines.\r\nThe slaughter was so great that Soleiman was unable to rally his\r\nforces.[630] When they broke and fled, the offensive movement of the\r\nOsmanlis was at an end. Bayezid, now on the defensive, was driven back\r\nstep by step. His retreat was cut off. With his bodyguard and the\r\nrefugees from other battalions, he made a gallant fight upon a small\r\nhill, holding off the enemy for hours.[631] Long after nightfall, when\r\nthe main forces of Timur’s army, who had been pursuing the Osmanlis,\r\nreturned to the scene of victory, they learned that the Ottoman\r\nsovereign was still fighting on the hill. There was no more hope for\r\nBayezid. The last of the defenders were overwhelmed. ‘The Thunderbolt\r\ncontinued to wield a heavy battle-ax. As a starving wolf scatters a\r\nflock of sheep, he scattered the enemy. Each blow of his redoubtable ax\r\nstruck in such a way that there was no need of a second blow.’[632] At\r\nlast, as he tried to withdraw over the hill, he was overpowered,[633]\r\nhis hands were bound behind his back, and he was sent to Timur’s tent.\r\n\r\nWith Bayezid, his son Musa and several of his highest officials, one of\r\nwhom was Timurtash, were taken prisoners. Mustafa disappeared. Soleiman,\r\nMohammed, and Isa succeeded in escaping.[634]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Angora is memorable in Ottoman annals as the only crushing\r\ndefeat experienced by the Osmanlis in the first three centuries of their\r\nhistory, and as the one instance where a sovereign of the house of Osman\r\nhas been captured. But it cannot be placed among the memorable conflicts\r\nthat have changed the course of history; for it did not affect the\r\nfortunes of the nation that won or of the nation that lost. It was not\r\nlike Kossova and Nicopolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nBayezid was brought before his conqueror at midnight, when Timur was\r\nseeking relaxation from the strain of the combat in his favourite game\r\nof chess with his son, Shah-Rokh. Bayezid had lost nothing of his\r\nhaughty spirit, and did not try to win the good graces of Timur. He was\r\nnever more the sovereign than in this moment of humiliation. So\r\nimpressed was Timur with the manner and bearing of his prisoner, that he\r\naccorded him every honour due to his rank.\r\n\r\nBut this spirit of generosity quickly passed. Whether it was because\r\nBayezid tried to escape or that Timur feared an attempt at rescue as he\r\nmarched farther into Ottoman territory, Timur’s attitude soon changed.\r\nTo break Bayezid’s spirit he began to mock him and treat him with\r\ncontempt. He ordered him to be put in chains at night, and to be carried\r\non the march in a litter with bars, which was nothing less than a\r\ncage.[635] At Brusa, Bayezid’s harem was taken from him. It has been\r\nrecorded that Timur went so far as to use his unfortunate rival as a\r\nfootstool for mounting his horse and at the table, and that Bayezid was\r\ncompelled to witness the degradation of his wife, the Serbian princess\r\nDespina, who in a state of nudity served the Tartar conqueror with wine\r\nat his feasts.[636]\r\n\r\nThis disgraceful treatment, coupled with the fact that his sons made no\r\nattempt to bring another army to fight for their father’s freedom or\r\neven to ransom him, at last broke the spirit of Bayezid. For nine months\r\nhe had been held up to ridicule in the Tartar army. He had seen his\r\nharem violated. He had seen Timur pass with ease from one portion of the\r\nOttoman possessions in Asia to another. Smyrna, which he had never been\r\nable to attack, fell before the Tartars. The Turkish emirs whom he had\r\ndispossessed were settled again in their states. When Bayezid learned\r\nthat he was to be taken to Konia, and then to Samarkand, his mind gave\r\nway. He died of apoplexy at Ak Sheïr.[637] Timur allowed Musa to take\r\nhis father’s body to Brusa for burial.[638] He had by this time lost\r\ninterest in the Osmanlis and Asia Minor, and was dreaming of new fields\r\nof conquest.\r\n\r\nBayezid died a victim not ‘to his destiny’, as the Ottoman historians\r\nput it, but to his vices, and to his abandonment of the policy of his\r\npredecessors, that assimilation should keep pace with territorial\r\naggrandizement. There never need have been an Angora. Timur had no\r\ninclination to invade the Ottoman dominions. Bayezid goaded him into it.\r\nEven if the test of an Angora had been necessary, Bayezid would have\r\nsustained it and weathered the Tartar storm, had he been the same man he\r\nwas at Nicopolis. In facing a Tartar invasion, the advantage was all on\r\nBayezid’s side. He failed because his mental and physical faculties,\r\nwhich rivalled, if they did not surpass, those of any man of his age,\r\nhad become impaired by a life of debauchery.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nAfter the victory at Angora, the Tartar hordes swept across Asia Minor.\r\nTimur sent his grandson, Mohammed-Sultan, in pursuit of Soleiman, who\r\nsucceeded in escaping from Brusa just as the Tartar horsemen arrived at\r\nthe gates of the city. The Tartars stabled their horses in the mosques,\r\nwhile the city was ransacked for its treasures and its young girls. Fire\r\nfollowed pillage.[639] The sons of Alaeddin of Karamania were set free,\r\nand Bayezid’s wives and daughters, with one exception, were sent to\r\nTimur, who had established his residence at Kutayia.\r\n\r\nIn the search for Soleiman, of whose movements he was in ignorance,\r\nMohammed-Sultan sent soldiers north to Gemlik and Nicaea, and west to\r\nMikhalitch and Karasi. These cities were pillaged, and their inhabitants\r\nreduced to slavery. When Mohammed-Sultan learned that Soleiman had\r\nescaped to Europe, he sent an embassy to him demanding unconditional\r\nsurrender. There was no reply. The question of invading Europe was\r\nreferred to Timur. In the meantime, the advance guard of the Tartars\r\ndevastated the country which was the cradle of the Ottoman race, while\r\ntheir commander celebrated at Yeni Sheïr his marriage to the eldest\r\ndaughter of Bayezid. Thus were united the families of Timur and his\r\nvanquished foe.[640]\r\n\r\nMohammed-Sultan went into winter quarters at Magnesia.[641] Timur left\r\nKutayia in charge of Shah-Rokh, and moved on to Ephesus. He recalled the\r\ncolumns which had been devastating western Asia Minor, and concentrated\r\nhis forces against Smyrna. What Bayezid had been unable to accomplish in\r\nseven years, Timur did in two weeks.[642] The assault of Smyrna was\r\ncarried on with unceasing energy, and every possible measure was taken\r\nto bring it to a speedy conclusion. The walls were undermined, and\r\nbridges built out over the water in order that an attack might be made\r\nfrom the side of the sea. When the fortress which crowns the hill behind\r\nthe city was entered from the land side, the chevaliers of Rhodes fought\r\ntheir way down to their galleys. With lance and sword and oar they beat\r\noff the despairing inhabitants who would have swamped their boats. All\r\nexcept a thousand succeeded in escaping. These were decapitated, and of\r\ntheir heads Timur built a pyramid to commemorate his victory.[643]\r\n\r\nTimur returned to Ephesus. As he approached the city, children came out\r\nto meet him, singing songs to appease his wrath. ‘What is this noise?’\r\nhe asked. When his attendants told him, he ordered his horsemen to ride\r\nover the children. They were trampled to death.[644]\r\n\r\nSmyrna fell in December, 1402. Timur spent the rest of the winter in\r\nEphesus. He destroyed the work of Bayezid in Asia Minor by restoring to\r\nthe deposed emirs or their heirs the emirates of Karamania, Tekke,\r\nMenteshe, Sarukhan, Aïdin, Kastemuni, and Erzindjian. When he saw that\r\nthe sons of Bayezid were ready to quarrel about the succession of their\r\nfather, he began to treat with Isa, Musa and Mohammed, encouraging in\r\neach the hope of recognition as sole heir. To Soleiman he sent a\r\ndiploma, investing him with the Ottoman possessions in Europe as Tartar\r\nvassal.[645]\r\n\r\nTimur enjoyed the position he had won of arbiter of the destinies of the\r\nOttoman Empire. The princes of Europe were now seeking his favour more\r\ninsistently than before Angora. Henry IV of England wrote to him most\r\ncordially, and expressed the hope that he would be converted and become\r\nthe champion of Christianity.[646]\r\n\r\nManuel Palaeologos, who had learned from the Venetian Senate the news of\r\nBayezid’s defeat at Angora, hurried home from Europe.[647] He banished\r\nJohn to Lemnos, expelled the Ottoman colonists from Constantinople, and\r\nclosed their tribunal.[648] To Timur he sent an embassy offering to\r\nacknowledge his suzerainty, and expressing his willingness to pay to him\r\nthe tribute that had been given to Bayezid. But when Timur responded\r\nwith an order to prepare a fleet to help the Tartar hordes to pass into\r\nEurope, Manuel was seized with panic. Smyrna had just fallen, and he\r\nfelt that a similar fate was now reserved for Constantinople. An\r\nambassador was sent to Rome and Venice to implore the immediate aid of\r\nthe Vatican and the Senate.[649]\r\n\r\nTimur, however, had become tired of Asia Minor and the western campaign.\r\nHe had no constructive policy. He never attempted to organize his\r\nconquests into a world empire. Like the earlier conquerors of his race,\r\nTimur was a raider. Satiety came with destruction and victory, that is,\r\nsatiety for the particular conquest in which he was engaged. So he\r\nturned his back on Constantinople and the glittering possibilities of a\r\nEuropean invasion. He wanted to return to Samarkand to enjoy the fruits\r\nof his victories. Perhaps his character was only the reflection of that\r\nof his followers.\r\n\r\nThe march had hardly started when Bayezid died at Ak Sheïr, in March,\r\n1403. From this moment Timur forgot all about the Osmanlis. After a\r\nbrief sojourn at Konia, he left Asia Minor. Within two years he died of\r\nfever while on his way to conquer China.[650]\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nAfter Angora the Ottoman army could have been annihilated; for Timur\r\nsent his victorious Tartars hot upon the heels of the refugees. Not only\r\ndid they follow Soleiman to the Sea of Marmora, and the divisions which\r\nhad retreated to the Bosphorus, but they pursued closely the main body\r\nof the army, which, to the number of possibly forty thousand, had fled\r\nalong the customary line of march to the Dardanelles.[651] There Greeks\r\nand Latins vied in helping the refugees to cross.[652] A Venetian\r\neye-witness of the crossing of the Bosphorus wrote that the Venetians in\r\ngood faith offered to join with the Genoese in refusing to transport the\r\nOsmanlis who were crowded upon the Asiatic shore. But the Genoese\r\nstarted secretly to ferry them over to Europe, with the aid of the\r\nGreeks. Then the Venetians, fearing to lose favour with the Osmanlis,\r\nstarted in to help.[653] This testimony is corroborated by Clavijo, who\r\nvisited Constantinople in the following year. He adds that Timur was\r\ndisgusted with the way the Greeks and Latins failed to co-operate with\r\nhim in destroying the Ottoman army.[654]\r\n\r\nThe astonishing fact is then clearly demonstrated that Greeks,\r\nVenetians, and Genoese made no effort to take advantage of their great\r\nopportunity. Nor did they, during the ten years of civil war that\r\nfollowed the death of Bayezid, make any move, in concert or separately,\r\nto drive the Osmanlis out of Europe. When it was not yet certain what\r\nTimur would do in regard to Asia Minor, or even whether he would invade\r\nEurope,[655] the Venetians and Genoese established with Soleiman at\r\nAdrianople the same friendly relations that they had been so careful to\r\nmaintain with his father, and fought each other in the Bosphorus. Pope\r\nBoniface was straining every nerve to help Ladislas of Sicily to win the\r\ncrown of Hungary against Sigismund,[656] who, alone of the princes of\r\nEurope, had his hands been free, might have contested the Balkan\r\npeninsula with the warring factions of the Osmanlis.\r\n\r\nThe decade of civil war among the sons of Bayezid passed without\r\ninterference from the outside world, and without a single uprising on\r\nthe part of the subjugated Balkan Christians. The house of Osman,\r\nalthough divided against itself, did stand. In 1413, Mohammed I,\r\ntriumphing over his brothers, became sole sovereign of the Osmanlis. The\r\ncrisis was over, and the career of conquest, interrupted for the moment\r\nby Timur, was resumed.\r\n\r\nNicopolis had proved that the Osmanlis could hold against Europe what\r\nthey had won. Angora had proved that they were too firmly rooted in the\r\nBalkan peninsula and in north-western Asia Minor, as an indigenous race\r\nand as a nation, to be destroyed by the misfortunes of their dynasty.\r\nSince the test of possession is ability to hold, in foul weather as well\r\nas in fair, who can deny that the Osmanlis under Bayezid had inherited\r\nthe Byzantine Empire?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nTRADITIONAL MISCONCEPTIONS OF THE ORIGIN OF THE OSMANLIS AND THEIR\r\nEMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has been said in this book on the origin of Ottoman power and the\r\nfoundation of the empire is so different from statements which have\r\nfound acceptance up to this time, that I am under the obligation to\r\njustify my position by a more technical discussion, and by a fuller\r\ncitation of authorities, than has been given in Chapter I. I shall deal\r\nwith these misconceptions singly.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THAT OSMAN WAS A PRINCE OF ILLUSTRIOUS BIRTH.\r\n\r\nChalcocondylas is responsible for the first and widest diffusion of this\r\nerror in western Europe. He claims that Osman is the great-grandson of\r\nDuzalp, ‘chief of the Oghuzes’; grandson of Oguzalp, who, aspiring to\r\nsucceed his father, reached ‘in a brief time the highest fame in Asia’;\r\nand son of Ertogrul, who, in 1298,[657] with his fleet, devastated the\r\nPeloponnesus, Euboea, and Attika.[658] Closely allied to the account of\r\nChalcocondylas is that of Hussein Hezarfenn.[659] According to Ali\r\nMuhieddin,[660] Seadeddin,[661] and Hadji Khalfa,[662] the grandfather\r\nof Osman was Soleiman Shah, prince or bey of Mahan in the Khorassan, who\r\nwas compelled to leave his country at the approach of Djenghiz Khan, and\r\nlived seven years in Armenia. As he was returning home, he was drowned\r\nin the Euphrates. Two of his sons, Ertogrul and Dundar, turned back into\r\nAsia Minor, and were, through the kindness of the Seljuk Sultan,\r\nAlaeddin I, given a residence near Angora, and, later, on the confines\r\nof Bithynia. Neshri places the time of residence in Armenia as 170\r\nyears, and declares that Soleiman Shah was leader of 50,000\r\nfamilies.[663] Practically all of the European historians who have\r\nwritten later than the publication in Europe of Chalcocondylas, Ali and\r\nSeadeddin have followed closely these authorities.[664]\r\n\r\nThe western writers, whose works appeared before the translation and\r\npublication of the eastern historians, or who followed earlier western\r\nauthorities, are either vague or uncertain concerning the parentage of\r\nOsman,[665] or give an entirely different story of the rise of his\r\nfamily. He is supposed to be the son of a Tartar shepherd, called\r\nZich,[666] who rises to fame at the court of Alaeddin I by defeating in\r\nsingle combat a Greek cavalier that had killed many of the favourites of\r\nthe Seljuk Sultan.[667] According to others, who give nearly the same\r\nstory, the name of Osman’s father is ‘the madman Delis, a\r\nshepherd’.[668] For his success in killing the Greek, the Sultan rewards\r\nhim with the castle of Ottomanzich, which is often confused with Sugut,\r\nand is claimed to be the origin of Osman’s name.[669] By another story,\r\nwhich is asserted to be the invention of Mohammed II, who thus wanted to\r\nlegitimatize in the eyes of the world his claim to the throne of the\r\nCaesars, Osman is the descendant of a certain Isaac Comnenus, a member\r\nof the imperial Byzantine family, who fled to the court of the Seljuks\r\nof Konia, and became a Moslem.[670]\r\n\r\nIn this, as in the discussion of other misconceptions which follow, we\r\nare not at all justified in throwing out categorically the testimony of\r\nthe early western writers every time that they conflict with the eastern\r\nauthorities, or in ignoring them entirely, as Hammer, Zinkeisen, and\r\nJorga have done. We must remember that Chalcocondylas and all the\r\nOttoman historians are _very late_, that they cite no sources upon which\r\nto base their assertions or inferences, and that they write with the\r\nintention to please, and under the necessity of pleasing, the Ottoman\r\ncourt, at a time when its rulers had become so powerful that they could\r\nnot brook the recording of an humble origin for their royal house. The\r\nextravagant descriptions of Seadeddin, for example, when he speaks of\r\nOsman’s court, and his expressions such as ‘laying his petition humbly\r\nat the feet of his royal master’, &c., seem much out of place in a\r\nnarrative about primitive and exceedingly plain and simple people. The\r\nwestern writers claim to have sources for information which are as early\r\nand as good as those of Ali and Seadeddin. Some of them certainly\r\nhad.[671] We cannot claim for these writers that their stories be\r\naccepted as fact. But we can claim that they be accepted as an honest\r\nreflection of late fifteenth-and early sixteenth-century opinion\r\nconcerning the founder of the Ottoman royal house--opinion derived from\r\nstories which were current in Constantinople at that time, and which,\r\nfor lack of definite history, were circulated among the Osmanlis\r\nthemselves up to a very much later period.[672]\r\n\r\nThe later western historians have taken, without critical examination,\r\nthe Ottoman accounts of the origin of their royal family, as they have\r\nof the relationship with the Seljuks of Konia, practically at their face\r\nvalue. But it is not hard to prove a good case against the Ottoman\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nThe story of Soleiman Shah, prince of Mahan and leader of 50,000\r\nfamilies, living and ruling in the neighbourhood of Erzerum between 1224\r\nand 1232, is very easy to disprove. The name of Mahan is often given to\r\ntwo cities, Dinewer and Nehawend.[673] It is rather the designation of a\r\nplain in which these two cities lay. In 1229, Sultan Djelaleddin, after\r\nhis defeat by the Mongols at Mughan, passed the winter in the plain of\r\nMahan. A certain Izzeddin was lord of the fortress there. He had been\r\nrebellious _some years before_, but was ‘now serving Djelaleddin\r\ndevoutly’.[674] In the history of Djelaleddin, I find absolutely no\r\nmention of a Soleiman Shah in connexion with Mahan or any other place in\r\nthat region. With 50,000 families, Soleiman Shah would have been a\r\nfactor in Armenia between 1224 and 1232. For that is precisely the time\r\nwhen Djelaleddin, Sultan of Kharesm, his logical suzerain or his enemy,\r\nwas struggling with the Seljuks of Konia in that very region! In 1229,\r\nDjelaleddin was at Erzindjian, and ravaged the whole country.[675] At\r\nthe same time, a cousin of Alaeddin I, a very powerful ruler, Rokneddin,\r\nwas lord of Erzerum, and was strong enough to be at enmity at the same\r\ntime with Djelaleddin’s invading army and with Alaeddin of Konia.[676]\r\nOther Arabic historians, and the Seljuk historian of this period,\r\nconfirm the history of Mohammed-en-Nesawi in its leading points, but\r\nthey, no more than the historian of Djelaleddin, make any mention\r\nwhatever of a Soleiman Shah, or of an Ertogrul.[677] Nor is Soleiman\r\nShah and his family mentioned in any of the Arabic genealogies prior to\r\nthe seventeenth century, although these exist in great numbers.[678]\r\nThere is only one Ottoman genealogy prior to the tables of Hadji\r\nKhalfa.[679]\r\n\r\nThe best authority on the western Turks, the late Léon Cahun,\r\nconservator of the Mazarine Library in Paris, declares that the Turkish\r\ntribes of the time of the purported Soleiman Shah and Ertogrul had no\r\nfamily ties. They knew no rank other than that of a man higher up in the\r\narmy. In inheritance, the younger son got the land, and the older sons\r\nthe movable possessions of the father. There were no family names; there\r\nare none to this day. The Turks who came into Asia Minor were without\r\nname or family. They wandered far and sold their services to get\r\nestablished family ties.[680]\r\n\r\nThere is one more testimony concerning the humble origin of the Ottoman\r\nroyal house. The different historians of the relations between Timur and\r\nBayezid I all speak of the taunt flung by Timur at Bayezid concerning\r\nthe Ottoman ruler’s lack of royal ancestors.[681] Bayezid never made any\r\nresponse to this taunt, and confined his boasting, which was by no means\r\nof a modest sort, to his own and his father’s achievements, and to his\r\npower as a European ruler.\r\n\r\nWe cannot establish the ancestry of Osman. It is altogether probable\r\nthat he had none of note, but was what Americans would call ‘a self-made\r\nman’.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THAT OSMAN BEGAN HIS CAREER AS A VASSAL OF ALAEDDIN III, SULTAN OF\r\nICONIUM, UPON WHOSE DEATH, IN OR ABOUT 1300, OSMAN AND NINE OTHER\r\nTURKISH PRINCES DIVIDED THE INHERITANCE OF THE SELJUCIDES; THAT OSMAN\r\nPROVED MORE POWERFUL THAN THE OTHER PRINCES, AND FOUNDED AN EMPIRE UPON\r\nTHE RUINS OF THE SELJUCIDE EMPIRE.\r\n\r\nWhen I call this statement, in its entirety, a misconception, I realize\r\nthat I am attacking the idea of the founding of the Ottoman Empire which\r\nhas been voiced by the most eminent historians and has an accepted and\r\nunquestioned place in textbooks and encyclopaedias, and in general\r\nhistories.\r\n\r\nIn a French translation of Chalcocondylas, published in 1662, under the\r\nwoodcut of Osman, we find these four lines:\r\n\r\n    ‘De simple Capitaine en des Pays déserts,\r\n     Près du grand Saladin la Fortune m’attire;\r\n     Et là de ses débris je fonde cet Empire,\r\n     Qui menace aujourd’huy d’engloutir l’Univers.’\r\n\r\nI quote this verse because it seems to me to express concisely the\r\ncommonly accepted idea of the foundation of the Ottoman Empire, as I\r\nfind it written everywhere. Hammer, whose eighteen volumes contain a\r\nwealth of material upon the Ottoman Empire not elsewhere to be found,\r\nand who shows remarkable erudition as well as care and critical powers,\r\nperpetuates the tales about Ertogrul and Osman and the court of Konia.\r\nHe makes the categorical statement, ‘The empire of the Seljuks broke up,\r\nand on its ruins arose that of Osman’.[682] Creasy has popularized the\r\nopinion of Hammer in the English-speaking world.[683] Lane-Poole, who\r\nhas written the only general history of the Ottoman Empire in English in\r\nour generation, has tacitly accepted the common tradition.[684]\r\nZinkeisen and Jorga, the only later historians whose names can be\r\ncoupled for scholarly work with that of Hammer, are most unsatisfactory\r\nin their failure to take up critically the Ottoman traditions of the\r\nearly days of the Empire.[685] Leunclavius, the sole writer in Western\r\nEurope before Hammer, whose work might be called ‘scientific’, discusses\r\nexhaustively and compares critically all authorities existing at his\r\ntime (1590) on most minute points of early Ottoman history, but is\r\nalmost silent on the grave inconsistencies and contradictions arising\r\nfrom the question of the relation between the Osmanlis and the Seljuks\r\nof Konia.[686] There is the same silence in Cantemir and his\r\ntranslators.[687] The latest Ottoman historian says: ‘Osman’s military\r\nand political career naturally divides itself into two parts, that in\r\nwhich he was vassal of Alaeddin, and that in which he became\r\nsultan.’[688] An Oriental whose work has enjoyed great vogue in France\r\ndeclares: ‘Osman pursued through every obstacle the realization of his\r\nplan, which consisted in founding upon the ruins of the Seljuk Empire a\r\ngreat, free, and independent state.’[689]\r\n\r\nI find one German scholar who, briefly touching upon the foundation of\r\nOsman’s power, rejects or ignores the connexion with the Seljuks of\r\nKonia; but he goes further afield, and makes the astonishing statement\r\nthat Osman conquered Bagdad, allowed the Khalifs only spiritual power,\r\ncalled himself Sultan, and became master of the Moslem world, thereby\r\nconnecting the Mongol conquest of Mesopotamia with the Mameluke conquest\r\nof Egypt, and attributing it all to Osman![690]\r\n\r\nIf we had good ground for rejecting the princely origin of Osman, our\r\njustification for impugning and discarding the connexion of Osman with\r\nthe Seljuks of Konia is stronger still.\r\n\r\nKaï Kobad Alaeddin, the only Sultan to whom the name of Alaeddin is\r\ngiven by common consent,[691] died in 1236.[692] He was succeeded by Kaï\r\nKhosrew II, Giazzeddin, or Ghizatheddin, who was Sultan at the time of\r\nthe great Mongol invasion of Asia Minor. In the spring of 1243, Erzerum\r\nwas sacked without having received any help from Konia. Some months only\r\nafter this event did Kaï Khosrew move. He was defeated at Mughan, near\r\nErzindjian, in a decisive battle,[693] and fled to Angora, abandoning\r\nhis baggage. Erzindjian fell next. Then Kaï Khosrew withdrew to Sivas,\r\nand from that city sent an embassy to the Mongols, making his submission\r\nand promising an annual tribute of four hundred thousand pieces of\r\nsilver. The Mongol armies penetrated as far as Smyrna. Everywhere\r\nsubmission was complete, although no effort was made to provide a new\r\ngovernment for the conquered regions in the western part of the\r\npeninsula. The Emperor of Trebizond became a vassal of the Mongols.[694]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Mughan cost the Seljuk Empire its independence.[695] After\r\n1246, when Kaï Khosrew died, the situation of the Seljuks of Konia is\r\ndepicted by Shehabeddin in these words: ‘The princes of the family of\r\nSeljuk kept only the title of sovereign, without having any authority or\r\nany power. There was left to them only that which concerned their own\r\nperson and their houses, the insignia of royalty, and sufficient money\r\nfor expenses of an indispensable necessity. The power belonged to Tartar\r\ngovernors, who managed everything without opposition. It was in the name\r\nof the princes of the family of Djenghiz Khan that the public prayer\r\nwas made, and that gold and silver money was struck.[696] When the\r\ndynasty of the Seljucides had arrived at the last degree of weakness ...\r\nraces of Turks seized a large part of these countries.... The Turks\r\nrecognized the pre-eminence of the prince of Kermian.’[697] There is not\r\na word of any possible Ottoman supremacy even in his own day, fifty\r\nyears later. Every source on the latter half of the thirteenth century\r\nwhich I have consulted corroborates the testimony of Shehabeddin.[698] I\r\nhave space to give only a few of the facts which I have gathered\r\nconcerning the fortunes of the Sultans of Konia during the period\r\n1246-1300, when Ertogrul and Osman are pictured by the Ottoman\r\nhistorians, and by the European historians who have followed them, as\r\nbasking in the sunshine of Seljuk imperial favour.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Kaï Khosrew, the empire was divided between his three\r\nsons, who, however, seemed to rule in common as vassals of the Mongols,\r\nfor their names were asserted to appear together on coins in 1249.[699]\r\nDuring the decade after the conquest, the Mongols overran western Asia\r\nMinor. We read that Sultan Rokneddin went with the Mongol general,\r\nBaïchu, into winter quarters _in Bithynia_,[700] and that Baïchu\r\nreceived orders from Khulagu Khan in 1257 to pillage the entire Seljuk\r\ndominions. In 1264, Abulfeda gives Rum, with its capital as Konia, among\r\nthe provinces ruled by Khulagu.[701] Bibars, Sultan of Egypt, succeeded\r\nin occupying Konia for a brief time in 1276.[702] In 1278, Abaka Khan\r\nopened negotiations with Haython, king of Little Armenia, with the view\r\nof making him Sultan of Rum. In 1282, Bibars, writing to Ahmed Khan,\r\nsays: ‘At this moment Konghurataï’ (a Mongol general) ‘is in the land of\r\nRum, _which is subject to you and pays you taxes_.’[703] In 1283,\r\nGhizatheddin, who was ruling with the merest semblance of royalty in\r\nKonia, was deposed by Ahmed Khan, exiled to Erzindjian, and replaced by\r\nMasud. There was anarchy everywhere in Asia Minor at this time.[704] The\r\ndistinguished French Orientalist, M. Huart, who studied in Konia itself\r\nthe inscriptions of the Seljuk Sultans, could find nothing after this\r\nperiod to indicate that the two final sultans who followed Ghizatheddin\r\nwere more than playthings of the Mongols.[705]\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Marco Polo is most precious to us here. When he passed\r\nthrough this country in 1271 he says that Konia, Sivas, Caesarea and\r\nmany other cities of ‘Turquemanie’ were subject to the Tartars, who\r\nimposed their rule there.[706] It was his impression that the Turcomans\r\nwere subject to local rulers, and responded to no central authority.\r\n\r\nThe last days of the Seljuks are most obscure. Masud ruled until 1296,\r\nwhen he was deposed by Ahmed Khan. For two years there was no ruler.\r\nWhether Firamurs ever ruled is a matter of doubt.[707] The last Sultan\r\nis generally given as Kaï Kobad, who remained Sultan for four or ten\r\nyears.[708] However, there was no Sultan actually ruling as sovereign in\r\nKonia either in 1290 or in 1300. Neither Masud nor Kaï Kobad could have\r\ngiven Osman feudal rights or a charter of independence. There was no\r\ndissolution of the Seljuk Empire in 1300. In all except mere name, it\r\nhad become extinct before Osman was born.\r\n\r\nThe Mongol conquerors never extended their political system to western\r\nAsia Minor. But, from 1246 to 1278, the Anatolians, Moslem and Christian\r\nalike, were in constant terror of the Mongol hordes. After 1276, the\r\nMongols were too occupied with the Mamelukes of Egypt, and with the\r\ndissensions arising in the eastern part of their great empire, to pay\r\nmuch attention to the remote Turkish tribes of Rum. During the last\r\nquarter of the thirteenth century, there was no change in the _status\r\nquo_ of the Seljuks at Konia that affected in any way the fortunes of\r\nthese tribes. We can explain their rise into independent principalities,\r\nnot by the disappearance of the Seljuk Sultans, but by the diversion of\r\nMongol energy to other quarters.\r\n\r\nAmong early western writers there was great divergency of opinion about\r\nthe number of the ‘Seljuk heirs’. I have found them represented as\r\none,[709] three,[710] four,[711] five,[712] and seven.[713] Pachymeres,\r\nif we can trust the text of the Bonn edition,[714] is the earliest\r\nwriter to mention the traditional number of ten.[715] When the Seljuk\r\nEmpire fell before the Mongols, it had no heirs in Asia Minor. During\r\nthe latter half of the thirteenth century and the first quarter of the\r\nfourteenth century (1250-1325) an innumerable number of village\r\nchieftains endeavoured to form states. There were many more than ten.\r\nThe states which existed at the beginning of the reign of Orkhan I have\r\nput into another appendix.[716]\r\n\r\nThere is no record of Osman having attacked his Turkish neighbours. The\r\ntestimony of the best Ottoman authorities is categorical on this point.\r\nOrkhan extended his father’s dominions very little to the south: not at\r\nall towards the east. Murad’s activities in Asia Minor were the least\r\nsuccessful part of his career, and were by no means permanent.\r\nSherefeddin Ali, whom we may regard as the best contemporary source for\r\nthe end of the fourteenth century, states explicitly: ‘Bayezid reduced\r\nunder his dominion a large portion of the country of Rum, that is to\r\nsay, the provinces of Aïdin, of Menteshe, of Kermian and of Karamania, a\r\nthing which his ancestors had never been able to bring to an end.’[717]\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts of the case, it is strange that the idea of Osman\r\nas the powerful heir of the Seljuks, who mastered the other aspirants to\r\nthat honour, has had such a long lease of life through centuries. Many\r\nof the early writers made Osman master of all Asia Minor.[718] It is\r\ncommonly recorded that he captured Sivas.[719] One writer placed in that\r\ncity his capital.[720] Another credited him with the capture of\r\nKonia.[721] Misinformation of this sort was given to Charles VI of\r\nFrance by returning pilgrims,[722] and, a century and a quarter later,\r\nto Frances I.[723] The early idea of the Osmanlis as an Asiatic people,\r\nof large numbers,[724] who conquered Asia Minor and then overthrew the\r\nByzantine Empire,[725] has persisted to this day. One of the sanest\r\nOttoman writers of modern times, who has brought wide knowledge and\r\njudgement to bear upon the history of the Ottoman army, is led astray by\r\nthis misconception. He says, ‘It was the Arabic and Persian states that\r\nthe Ottoman Empire had to fight _before_ _any other_’. So it is natural\r\nthat he should be puzzled by finding in the military museum at\r\nConstantinople early Ottoman weapons on Byzantine and European models.\r\nHe explains this by saying that these weapons were not used by the\r\nOsmanlis, but must have been captured, for the Osmanlis, naturally,\r\nwould use Persian and Arabic models![726]\r\n\r\nBut Colonel Djevad is not more in error than the two greatest French\r\nauthorities on Ottoman architecture. Saladin, in his summary of Ottoman\r\nhistory, instructs his readers as follows: ‘Alaeddin III, conquered by\r\nthe Mongols, abandoned the sovereignty to Osman.... When the Osmanlis\r\npenetrated into Anatolia ... in proportion to the extension westward of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, we shall see the influence of Byzantine architecture\r\nincrease.... Little by little, as the Turks approached Constantinople,\r\nthis impregnation of the influence of Byzantium had an increasingly\r\ngreater importance in the development of Ottoman art.’[727] This\r\nmisconception of the origin of the Osmanlis leads him to state: ‘It is\r\nthen indispensable to study the Seljuk monuments of Konia, which have\r\n_necessarily_ served as models to the first Ottoman monuments.’[728]\r\nFrom his premisses, Saladin has argued rightly. But his historical facts\r\nare wrong. Even if they were not, his conclusion could still be proved\r\nwrong. The refutation of his statement exists in the two earliest\r\nOttoman buildings, the school and the kitchen for the poor at Nicaea,\r\nthe date of whose construction Seadeddin places in 1331.[729] Both of\r\nthese are typically Byzantine. In Brusa there is no Ottoman building of\r\nthe Seljuk type which can be proved to have been constructed prior to\r\nMohammed I (1413-21).[730] Parvillée, to whom the whole world owes a\r\ndebt of gratitude for his able reconstruction of the precious historic\r\nmonuments of Brusa, starts his scholarly work on Ottoman architecture in\r\nthe fifteenth century with these words: ‘Towards the end of the\r\nthirteenth century the Seljuk Empire disappeared. On its ruins arose\r\nthat of Osman.’ He not only follows Hammer: he uses his very words![731]\r\nFrom the historical point of view, I maintain that the Byzantine\r\ninfluence was an indissoluble factor in the evolution of Ottoman\r\narchitecture from the very beginning. In this I am supported, from the\r\nexpert architect’s point of view, by the two German authorities on this\r\nsubject.[732] The Seljuk, Arab, and Persian influences entered in at a\r\nconsiderably later period.\r\n\r\nThere exists in tradition and in law an intimate connexion between the\r\nHouse of Osman and the Grand Tchelebi of Konia. This has been pointed to\r\nas a confirmation of the hypothesis that the Ottoman sovereigns derived\r\ntheir authority originally from the Seljuks of Rum. I do not deny the\r\nforce of tradition. In the absence of early records, the beginning of\r\nthis connexion must remain a moot question. But the evidence from\r\noutside sources makes reasonable my doubt as to the existence of this\r\nconnexion before the reign of Mohammed I or Murad I.\r\n\r\nThere are two other arguments which might be adduced in this appendix,\r\nthe questions of Osman’s title as an independent ruler, and of the\r\nchieftainship as an elective office among the Turkish tribes. But both\r\nof these have already been discussed in the text and the foot-notes of\r\nthe chapter on Orkhan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\nTHE EMIRATES OF ASIA MINOR DURING THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to support the contention of this book, that the Ottoman Empire\r\nwas founded (in the durable sense of that word) upon the ruins of the\r\nByzantine Empire _as it existed at the time of Osman_ (1300), and gained\r\nits power and prestige in the Balkan peninsula rather than in Asia\r\nMinor, there must be set forth, as far as it is possible to do so within\r\nthe limits of an appendix, an _exposé_ of the extent and power of the\r\nother emirates of Asia Minor during the fourteenth century. Such a\r\nreview is useful, not only to prove the argument, but also to enable the\r\nreader to follow intelligently the development of Ottoman power; for\r\nthere are difficulties attendant upon the writing and the reading of a\r\nhistory where the geographical names are unfamiliar. The writer is faced\r\nwith the dilemma of making his work meaningless or uninteresting:\r\nmeaningless if he fails to enlighten his readers as to the places and\r\npeoples whom he mentions; uninteresting if he interrupts his narrative\r\nwith technical, encyclopaedic explanations.\r\n\r\nA special map accompanies this appendix. The list of emirates contains\r\nafter each name a number in brackets, which refers to the map. As in\r\nalmost all cases the geographical limits are vague, the general position\r\nonly of each emirate can be given. To put in definite boundary lines\r\nwould be mere conjecture. Then, too, at different times during the\r\nfourteenth century, independent emirates overlapped each other.\r\nSometimes they were confined to single cities or villages.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this appendix, I am indebted to several modern scholars\r\nwhose work is most suggestive.[733] But I believe that this\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EMIRATES OF ASIA MINOR IN THE 14^{TH} CENTURY]\r\n\r\nis the first attempt to compare the Asiatic possessions of Osman,\r\nOrkhan, Murad, and Bayezid with those of their Turkish rivals for the\r\npurpose of illustrating the slow growth of the Ottoman Empire in Asia\r\nMinor, and the first time that contemporary sources have been drawn upon\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\nFrom the eleventh to the thirteenth century, we are able to reconstruct\r\nthe political status of Asia Minor, in a general way, from the\r\nnarratives of pilgrims and the experiences of the Crusaders. From the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century on to the present day, we have a\r\nwealth of sources for the history of Asia Minor in the writings of\r\nEuropean travellers, which are valuable not only for their geographical\r\nindications and their observations on the life of the people, but also\r\nfor their testimony in corroborating or disproving the statements of\r\nOriental historians, who are so often lacking in precision and\r\nverisimilitude. For the fourteenth century, however, reliable European\r\nsources are lacking.\r\n\r\nThis lacuna is filled by the travel records of two Moslems of more than\r\nordinary intelligence and powers of observation.\r\n\r\nThe long-lost manuscript of the travels of Ibn Batutah was one of those\r\nimportant finds that made the French occupation of Algeria so memorable\r\nan event in the annals of the advancement of learning. Its translation\r\ninto French in 1843 made accessible for the first time a contemporary\r\nsource of the highest value for the political and social life of the\r\nwhole Moslem world during the first half of the fourteenth century. For\r\nIbn Batutah travelled from his home in Morocco to the confines of China.\r\nHe lived a while in each country that he visited, and wrote from the\r\nsympathetic and understanding point of view of a member of the Moslem\r\nclergy. Ibn Batutah visited Asia Minor between 1330 and 1340.[734]\r\n\r\nShehabeddin was an Arabic writer from Damascus,[735] who died in 1349.\r\nHe wrote a voluminous work of twenty volumes, called _Footpaths of the\r\nEyes in the Kingdoms of Different Countries_.[736] He was a contemporary\r\nof Ibn Batutah. Shehabeddin did not enjoy the advantage of visiting\r\npersonally the many emirates of western Asia Minor, as did Ibn Batutah;\r\nbut he states that he has based his record of these countries upon the\r\neye-witness information furnished to him by word of mouth by Sheik\r\nHaïdar of Sir Hissar.[737] The agreement between Ibn Batutah and\r\nShehabeddin on the state of affairs in Asia Minor during the first half\r\nof the fourteenth century is so general that one can claim for their\r\nstatements, which are, in large part, the basis of this appendix, most\r\nsubstantial grounding.\r\n\r\nThe other sources are the Byzantine historians, the chronicler of the\r\nCatalans, the Catalan Map of 1375,[738] the annalist of Trebizond, the\r\npoints of contact with the Cypriotes, the chevaliers of Rhodes, the\r\nItalian traders, the Osmanlis and the Mongols and Tartars. For a few of\r\nthe emirates there are coins extant. Inscriptions on public edifices,\r\nsuch as mosques, pious foundations, baths and fountains, are\r\nunfortunately lacking, not only for the history of the Turkish emirates\r\nbut for the Osmanlis as well.[739]\r\n\r\nIn the list that follows, twenty-six of the emirates existed during the\r\nreign of Orkhan, between the years 1330 and 1350. They are mentioned\r\neither by Ibn Batutah or by Shehabeddin, in most cases by _both_, as\r\nindependent in their day. The others are either earlier or later than\r\nOrkhan’s reign, and comprise a portion of earlier emirates, from which\r\nthey had become detached. After the Turkish emirates, given\r\nalphabetically, are placed the non-Turkish independent states in Asia\r\nMinor.\r\n\r\n    Adalia: _see_ Satalia\r\n    Adana (1)\r\n    Afion Kara Hissar: _see_ Karasar\r\n    Aïdin (2)\r\n    Akbara (3)\r\n    Akridur (4)\r\n    Akseraï (5)\r\n    Aksheïr (6)\r\n    Alaïa (7)\r\n    Altoluogo: _see_ Ayasoluk\r\n    Angora (8)\r\n    Armenia: _see_ Little Armenia (44)\r\n    Arzendjian: _see_ Erzindjian\r\n    Attaleia: _see_ Satalia\r\n    Ayasoluk (9)\r\n    Balikesri (10)\r\n    Berkeri (Birgui, Berki): _see_ Aïdin\r\n    Borlu (11)\r\n    Brusa (12)\r\n    Caesarea (13)\r\n    Cilicia: _see_ Little Armenia (44) and Adana (1)\r\n    Daouas: _see_ Tawas\r\n    Denizli (14)\r\n    Djanik: _see_ Kaouïa\r\n    Egherdir: _see_ Akridur\r\n    Ephesus: _see_ Ayasoluk\r\n    Erzindjian (15)\r\n    Fukeh (16)\r\n    Germian: _see_ Kermian\r\n    Gul Hissar (17)\r\n    Guzel Hissar: _see_ Aïdin\r\n    Halik (Halicarnassus): _see_ Fukeh\r\n    Hamid (18)\r\n    Iakshi(19)\r\n    Ionia: _see_ Aïdin\r\n    Kaïseriya: _see_ Caesarea\r\n    Kandelore: _see_ Alaïa\r\n    Kaouïa (20)\r\n    Karamania (21)\r\n    Karasar (22)\r\n    Karasi (23)\r\n    Kastemuni (24)\r\n    Keredeh (25)\r\n    Kermasti (26)\r\n    Kermian (27)\r\n    Konia: _see_ Karamania\r\n    Kul Hissar: _see_ Gul Hissar\r\n    Kutayia: _see_ Kermian\r\n    Ladik (Laodicea): _see_ Denizli\r\n    Larenda: _see_ Karamania\r\n    Limnia (28)\r\n    Lydia: _see_ Sarukhan\r\n    Magnesia: _see_ Sarukhan\r\n    Marash (29)\r\n    Marmora (30)\r\n    Menteshe (31)\r\n    Milas: _see_ Fukeh\r\n    Miletus: _see_ Palatchia\r\n    Mikhalitch (32)\r\n    Nazlu (33)\r\n    Nicaea (34)\r\n    Palatchia (35)\r\n    Pamphylia: _see_ Tekke\r\n    Pergama: _see_ Karasi\r\n    Sarukhan (36)\r\n    Satalia (37)\r\n    Sinope (38)\r\n    Sis: _see_ Adana\r\n    Sivas (39)\r\n    Sulkadir: _see_ Marash\r\n    Tawas (40)\r\n    Tekke (41)\r\n    Theologos: _see_ Ayasoluk\r\n    Tokat (42)\r\n    Tralles: _see_ Aïdin\r\n    Ulubad (Lopadion) (43)\r\n    Little Armenia (44)\r\n    Trebizond (45)\r\n    Phocaea (46)\r\n    Smyrna (47)\r\n    Byzantine possessions (48)\r\n    Cypriote possessions (49)\r\n    Mongol and Tartar possessions (50)\r\n    Rhodian possessions (51)\r\n    Egyptian possessions (52)\r\n    Catalan possessions (53)\r\n\r\nThe material that can be gathered about these Turkish emirates, the two\r\nindependent Christian states, and the spheres of influence of outside\r\nChristian and Moslem states in Asia Minor in the fourteenth century,\r\nwould make a book in itself. In this appendix I desire to give only\r\nenough to indicate the relative strength and vitality of each state. It\r\nmust be borne in mind that my object is not to write the history of\r\nthese emirates, or of Asia Minor as a whole, during the fourteenth\r\ncentury, but _to demonstrate how little of Asia Minor was really\r\nincorporated in the Ottoman possessions at the time that, and during the\r\nthirty years after, the capital of the new empire was established in\r\nAdrianople_.\r\n\r\n\r\nADANA (1)\r\n\r\nIn the Taurus Mountains, on the northern limits of Lesser Armenia, and\r\nto the south-east of Karamania, the Turcoman tribes through whom Marco\r\nPolo passed seemed to him to enjoy an independent existence. Up to the\r\ntime of Murad I, they formed no state, but between 1373 and 1375 the\r\nfamily of Ramazan took the chieftainship. When the Mamelukes destroyed\r\nthe Armenian kingdom (1375), the Ben-Ramazan dynasty established itself\r\nat Adana, on the Sarus, in the fertile Cilician plain.[740] The\r\nBen-Ramazan emirs managed to keep from being absorbed either by the\r\nKaramanians or the Egyptians. After the complete subjugation of\r\nKaramania by the Osmanlis, they submitted to Selim I about 1510, under\r\nthe stipulation, however, that the emir, Piri pasha, should hold office\r\nfor life as vali of Adana and Sis. Sis was frequently coupled with Adana\r\nin the title of the Ben-Ramazan.\r\n\r\n\r\nAÏDIN (2)\r\n\r\nAïdin comprised the greater part of Ionia, with a portion of Lydia, if\r\nwe take its boundaries to be those of the present vilayet of the same\r\nname. It comprised, at the time of its greatest extent, Smyrna, Ephesus,\r\nand Tralles. Smyrna was captured by the crusaders in 1344. Ephesus was\r\nat times independent under the name of Ayasoluk. Tralles, called Guzel\r\nHissar, and sometimes also Birgui or Berki, was the capital of Aïdin in\r\nthe time of Orkhan. Later, Ayasoluk, and, last of all, Tira, were the\r\nsuccessive capitals.\r\n\r\nThe emirate was founded by Aïdin, a contemporary of Osman, who was\r\nsucceeded by his son Mohammed about 1330. Ibn Batutah regarded Mohammed\r\nas a very powerful prince, who was especially strong on the sea. His\r\neldest son, Omar, who succeeded him in 1341, met death in an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to recapture Smyrna in 1348. His relations with\r\nCantacuzenos are given in the chapter on Orkhan. Isaac, fourth of the\r\nline, reigned from 1348, until he was dispossessed by Bayezid in 1390.\r\nHe died in exile at Nicaea. His sons, Isaac II and Omar II, were placed\r\nagain on the throne in 1403. The line of Aïdin became extinct soon\r\nafter. A usurper, Djuneïd, Ottoman governor of Smyrna, managed to keep\r\nthe power until he was assassinated in 1425. It was not until then that\r\nAïdin definitely passed into the hands of the Osmanlis.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Aïdin, the founder of the dynasty, the territory of\r\nthe emirate seems to have suffered some diminution, aside from the loss\r\nof Smyrna. One of the sons, Soleiman, married a daughter of Orkhan,\r\nwhile another, Khidr, ruled independently at Ayasoluk, which was lost\r\nfor a time to Rhodes twenty years later. Under Omar, the Turks of Aïdin\r\nwere very active in the Aegaean Sea, and made large invasions of Thrace\r\nand Macedonia in 1333 and 1334. They co-operated with the Genoese of\r\nPhocaea against the Greeks and the Osmanlis, and were at times allied\r\nwith the emirates of Sarukhan and Menteshe, with whom they are\r\nfrequently mixed by the Byzantine historians. The western historians\r\nalmost invariably gave credit to the Osmanlis for the maritime exploits\r\nof these emirates during the fourteenth century.[741]\r\n\r\n\r\nAKBARA (3)\r\n\r\nAt some time before 1340, a certain Demir Khan, son of Karasai, emir of\r\nPergama, ruled in Akbara, whose location is given by Shehabeddin as\r\n‘south of Brusa and Sinope, and north of Mount Kasis’. This emirate was\r\nprobably destroyed by Orkhan in the expedition of 1339-40. It was a\r\nregion along the borders of Mysia and Phrygia, which had been able to\r\nresist the encroachments of Kermian owing to the mountainous character\r\nof the country.[742]\r\n\r\n\r\nAKRIDUR (4)\r\n\r\nThis city was at the south end of the lake of the same name (to-day\r\ncalled Egherdir), and was within the limits of the emirate of Hamid.\r\nBut, like Nazlu, it had frequently a wholly independent existence, and\r\nboth Shehabeddin and Ibn Batutah, as well as other writers, mention its\r\nemirs as if independent of the emir of Hamid, and these rulers are given\r\nfrom the families of Tekke and Hamid. The Osmanlis first reached the\r\nnorthern end of Lake Egherdir in 1379, and incorporated Akridur about\r\n1390.[743]\r\n\r\n\r\nAKSERAÏ (5)\r\n\r\nThis is the ancient Archelaïs, and is three days north-east of Konia on\r\nthe road to Kaïsariya (Caesarea). In the time of Ibn Batutah, it was one\r\nof the most beautiful and most solidly built cities of Asia Minor, and\r\nwas ruled by the emir Artin, possibly an Armenian, who was vassal of the\r\nMongol ruler of Persia. Later, Ak Seraï was incorporated in Karamania,\r\nto which it belonged at the time that the Osmanlis, under Bayezid, first\r\nentered it.[744]\r\n\r\n\r\nAKSHEÏR (6)\r\n\r\nAksheïr, between Kutayia and Konia, belonged alternately to Kermian and\r\nKaramania--perhaps at times it recognized the suzerainty of the emir of\r\nHamid. Its position made it a border city, prey to the changing\r\nfortunes of the Osmanlis and Karamanlis for thirty years. In 1377, when\r\nMurad compelled the emir of Hamid to sell a portion of his dominions, he\r\nregarded Aksheïr as having been in Hamid. It was, however, at that time\r\npractically independent, using the rival pretensions of the emirs to the\r\neast, west, and south as a means of preserving a precarious\r\nautonomy.[745]\r\n\r\n\r\nALAÏA (7)\r\n\r\nThis city was sometimes called Kandelore, a corruption of its ancient\r\nname Coracesium. Its fortunate position at the east side of the Gulf of\r\nAdalia enabled it to play an important part in the commercial history of\r\nthe eastern Mediterranean for a century and a half. In the time of Ibn\r\nBatutah and Shehabeddin, Yussuf, brother of the emir of Karamania, was\r\nits ruler. During the fourteenth century Alaïa was more or less\r\ndependent upon Karamania, but sometimes upon Tekke. For many years it\r\npaid tribute to Cyprus, and negotiated its affairs independently of both\r\nKaramania and Tekke. In 1444 its prince, Latif, meditated a raid upon\r\nCyprus, from which he was deterred only by the defeat of the Egyptians\r\nbefore Rhodes. In 1450 Latif concluded a treaty of peace with the\r\nCypriotes through the medium of Rhodes. His successor, Arslan bey, got\r\nhelp from Cyprus against Mohammed II. Alaïa was subdued by the Osmanlis\r\nonly in 1472.[746]\r\n\r\n\r\nANGORA (8)\r\n\r\nThe history of Angora during the first half of the fourteenth century is\r\nobscure. It depended upon none of the emirates which arose after the\r\nbreak-up of the Seljuk Empire of Konia. Throughout Phrygia there were\r\nsmall village chieftains, such as Osman had been at Sugut. Angora may\r\nhave acknowledged Kermian for a short period, but the proprietors of\r\nthat region resisted the efforts of Karamania to incorporate them. The\r\nfortress of Angora was captured at the beginning of the reign of Murad,\r\nbut it was not until Bayezid broke the power of Kermian and Karamania\r\nthat the country round about the city became ottomanized.[747]\r\n\r\n\r\nAYASOLUK (9)\r\n\r\nThis is the Ottoman corruption of Altoluogo, the Genoese name for the\r\nByzantine Theologos (ἅγιος θεολόγος--St. John) which occupied nearly the\r\nsame site as the ancient Ephesus. This city has caused much confusion to\r\nwriters. It was captured from the Greeks by Sasan, who ruled there as\r\nits first Turkish emir in 1308.[748] Later it seems to have fallen into\r\nthe hands of Aïdin, and became the principal commercial city of his\r\nflourishing emirate. The emir’s coins were for a time struck there, but\r\nlater when Guzel Hissar (Tralles) was capital of Aïdin, Ayasoluk was\r\npractically independent under a younger brother of Mohammed, and uncle\r\nof Omar. In 1365 the chevaliers of Rhodes had evidently made a serious\r\nattempt to cut into the hinterland of Aïdin from Smyrna, for they struck\r\ncoins at Ayasoluk. Its later history is that of Aïdin and Palatchia.\r\nTimur directed the operations against Smyrna from Ephesus in December\r\n1402.[749]\r\n\r\n\r\nBALIKESRI (10)\r\n\r\nThis city is to the south-west of Brusa, on the road to Pergama. It\r\nwould naturally be included in the emirate of Karasi, but had an\r\nindependent sovereign, Demir-Khan, when Ibn Batutah visited it. It was\r\nannexed by the Osmanlis after the deposition of the emir of Balikesri.\r\nThe exact date of this acquisition cannot be determined.[750]\r\n\r\n\r\nBORLU (11)\r\n\r\nAn inland district south-west of Kastemuni and north of Angora, possibly\r\nthe same as Boli, where Ali, a son of Soleiman padishah, of Kastemuni\r\nand Sinope, ruled as independent sovereign between 1330 and 1340.[751]\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSA (12)\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of Orkhan’s realm, which to Ibn Batutah and Shehabeddin\r\nwas the emirate of Brusa, as it was seen through the eyes of his\r\ncontemporaries, have been cited in the text of this book. Until the end\r\nof the reign of Murad, the Ottoman possessions were small enough to be\r\ndistinguished under the name of Brusa, where the Osmanlis established an\r\nemirate at the death of Osman.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAESAREA (13)\r\n\r\nThis important city, in the east of Asia Minor, on the confines of\r\nArmenia, was during the first half of the fourteenth century under the\r\ncontrol of the Mongols, and, for a very few years, acknowledged the\r\noverlordship of Karamania. But, for the thirty years coincident with the\r\nreign of Murad, it had emirs of its own, as had Tokat and Sivas. For we\r\nknow that Burhaneddin, through whose misfortunes Bayezid became involved\r\nwith Timur, had been kadi of the emir of Caesarea, on whose death he\r\ndivided ‘with two other emirs’ his dominions. Caesarea fell into the\r\npower of the Osmanlis between 1392 and 1398.[752]\r\n\r\n\r\nDENIZLI (14)\r\n\r\nThis emirate was on the site of Laodicea on the Lycus, and was called\r\nLadik by the Arabs, and Denizli, or Denizlu, by the Turks. Mount Cadmus\r\nand Hieropolis were also within its limits. It was at the upper end of\r\nthe Maeander Valley, bounded on the west and north by Aïdin, and on the\r\nsouth by Menteshe and Tawas. In the fourteenth century, the city of its\r\nemir was probably on the Maeander and not on the Lycus. Shehabeddin\r\ncompared the gardens of Ladik, or Denizli, to those of Damascus. No\r\nhigher praise could have come from his lips. We know nothing of its\r\nlater history. About 1350 it was probably absorbed by Aïdin or\r\nMenteshe.[753]\r\n\r\n\r\nERZINDJIAN (15)\r\n\r\nErzindjian, like Erzerum, was subject to the Mongols in the early part\r\nof the reign of Orkhan. There was a prince named Aïnabey ruling there in\r\n1348, however, who, with two generals of Hamid, attacked Trebizond.[754]\r\nCoins were struck in the name of Alaeddin of Karamania in Erzindjian in\r\nthe decade following 1350. But coins of Mohammed Artin, emir of\r\nErzindjian, were struck there about 1360.[755] Bayezid pushed his\r\nconquests a day beyond Erzindjian to the castle of Kemath. He did not,\r\nhowever, conquer Erzindjian; for we have its emir, a vassal of Timur,\r\nappealing to his overlord for aid, when Bayezid summoned him to appear\r\nat Angora, bringing the treasures of his dependencies with him. His\r\nauthority extended to and included Erzerum about 1400.[756]\r\n\r\n\r\nFUKEH (16)\r\n\r\nIbn Batutah calls this country Milas. There were in fact two cities,\r\nFukeh and Milas, under one sovereign at the time of Ibn Batutah and\r\nShehabeddin. As Milas was near the site of Halicarnassus, or on that\r\nsite, and was sometimes called Halik, the geographical position of this\r\nemirate, on the coast opposite Cos, is immediately grasped. It was\r\ndependent, in a certain sense, upon Menteshe, and was later absorbed by\r\nMenteshe. Orkhan was the emir about 1330. Some years later, Shehabeddin\r\nestimated that the emir of Fukeh had fifty cities and ten thousand\r\nhorsemen. The last vestige of the independence of Fukeh was destroyed by\r\nthe Rhodians with whom they were continually in conflict, and who got a\r\nfoothold on the mainland and built a castle at Halik in 1399.[757]\r\n\r\n\r\nGUL HISSAR (17)\r\n\r\nAt the time of Ibn Batutah, Mohammed Tchelebi, brother of the emir of\r\nAkridur, was established here on the border of Pamphylia and Caria,\r\nbetween Satalia and the Maeander River.[758] The fact that in such a\r\nposition an independent prince could maintain himself as late as\r\n1330--perhaps later--demonstrates that the emirates of Tekke, Menteshe,\r\nand Hamid must have been of very slow growth, like that of Brusa, and\r\nthat these Turkish emirs who were rivals of the house of Osman evolved\r\nslowly, just as the Osmanlis did. The fiction of a tenfold division of\r\nthe Seljuk dominions becomes very apparent when we consider the position\r\nof Gul Hissar (often called Kul Hissar), Alaïa, Tawas, and Fukeh--to\r\ncite instances only from the south-western corner of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMID (18)\r\n\r\nThis emirate, of very late development in comparison with those of\r\nSarukhan and Aïdin, was formed by the absorption of a number of little\r\nstates--each hardly more than a village. The emir of Hamid started by\r\nincorporating Akridur and Nazlu. During the last decade of the reign of\r\nOrkhan, Hamid grew rapidly, until it extended from Aksheïr to the\r\nwestern end of the Taurus. It was entirely an inland emirate, and had\r\nlittle chance of resisting the Osmanlis under Murad. The last emir\r\nwilled his dominions to Murad in 1381, but the country had to be\r\nconquered step by step. Bayezid made it an Ottoman province in\r\n1391.[759]\r\n\r\n\r\nIAKSHI (19)\r\n\r\nA small emirate north-west of Sarukhan, on the sea-coast opposite\r\nMitylene. It is mentioned only by Shehabeddin, and for the purpose of\r\nfixing the boundaries of Sarukhan.[760]\r\n\r\n\r\nKAOUÏA (20)\r\n\r\nThis is the modern Djanik, on the Black Sea between Samsun and Sinope.\r\nIt had an independent line of four emirs, and probably maintained its\r\nindependence until after the Ottoman conquest of Kastemuni.[761]\r\n\r\nKARAMANIA (21)\r\n\r\nUntil after the campaign of 1386, Karamania was a far more powerful\r\nemirate in Asia Minor than that of the Osmanlis. The Karamanlis were\r\nthe actual successors of the Seljuks, and maintained themselves in\r\nKonia. While the Osmanlis were confined to a very small corner of\r\nAnatolia, the Karamanian dominions extended from the Euphrates and the\r\nAmanus to the Gulf of Adalia, on both slopes of the Taurus. Except in\r\nthe maritime emirates of the Aegaean Sea, the Karamanlis and their emir\r\nwere the great power in the peninsula of Asia Minor. Their independence\r\nwas not broken by Bayezid, for they recovered their former glory after\r\nthe intervention of Timur, and successfully withstood Mohammed I, Murad\r\nII, and Mohammed II. As in the latter half of the fourteenth century,\r\nthe Karamanian emirs of the first half of the fifteenth century were\r\nallied by marriage with the house of Osman, but refused to do homage to\r\nthe Ottoman sovereigns.[762]\r\n\r\nLimits of space prevent mentioning here the many grounds upon which the\r\nKaramanians were able to and did keep their independence in the face of\r\nboth Constantinople and Cairo. It was only at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury that we find the fiction of the Karamanian vassalage to the\r\nOsmanlis and of the connexion between the Seljuks and the Osmanlis\r\nappearing in the Ottoman chronicles, which on this count are, as I have\r\npointed out elsewhere, wholly unreliable. It is astonishing that their\r\nversion of the rise of the Osmanlis in Asia Minor has been accepted for\r\nso many centuries by western historians.[763]\r\n\r\n\r\nKARASAR (22)\r\n\r\nAn abbreviation of Kara Hissar. This is probably the modern Afion Kara\r\nHissar, a picturesque town between Eski Sheïr and Konia on southern\r\nlimit of the emirate of Kermian, of which its prince was a vassal. Its\r\nimportance was in its location at the junction point of the roads from\r\nthe north-west and west into Karamania.\r\n\r\n\r\nKARASI (23)\r\n\r\nThe emirate which lay between the possessions of Orkhan and Sarukhan was\r\ncalled, after the founder of its dynasty, Karasi. Its capital was\r\nPergama. There is a discrepancy between the accounts of Shehabeddin and\r\nIbn Batutah, the forming making Pergama subject to Balikesri, and the\r\nlatter giving Balikesri as independent. Ottoman historians make\r\nBalikesri the northernmost city of the emirate of Karasi. The limits of\r\nKarasi, outside of the immediate vicinity of Pergama, cannot be\r\ndetermined. There were several small independent emirates in the\r\nhinterland of the lower end of the Sea of Marmora and the Dardanelles.\r\nThe emir of Karasi was an ally of Aïdin and Sarukhan in the first\r\ncoalition formed to combat the growing power of the Osmanlis. Karasi was\r\nthe first emirate to be destroyed by the Osmanlis, and the only one of\r\nimportance incorporated under Orkhan. This was because it lay nearest to\r\nthe Ottoman emirate.[764]\r\n\r\n\r\nKASTEMUNI (24)\r\n\r\nThis emirate, at its zenith, comprised practically all of the ancient\r\nRoman province of Paphlagonia. It was formed by Ali Omar bey, who\r\nstarted as lord of the inland city of Kastemuni, and whose son Abdullah,\r\nin the lifetime of Osman, drove Ghazi Tchelebi from Sinope. The emirate\r\nhad many vicissitudes and changes in dynasty. In the time of Ibn\r\nBatutah, Soleiman padishah was the sovereign, and had extended his rule\r\nfrom Heraclea on the Black Sea coast almost to Trebizond. His son Ali\r\nruled at Borlu, and another son Ibrahim Shah, who succeeded Soleiman,\r\ncontested Samsun with the emperor of Trebizond. Ibrahim was the younger\r\nson, and was designated as his successor by Soleiman. Under the third\r\ndynasty of Kastemuni, the ben-Isfendiar, the emirate was at the height\r\nof its power. Its fleets swept the Black Sea, and did much harm to the\r\nGreeks of Trebizond and the Genoese of Kaffa. Kaouïa was absorbed, and\r\nits eastern boundaries included Osmandjik. The emirs of Menteshe and\r\nAïdin took refuge here, and the refusal of the emir of Kastemuni,\r\nBayezid, to give them up, led to the invasion of 1392. Bayezid and the\r\nfugitive princes fled to Timur, who restored them after the battle of\r\nAngora. Isfendiar, son of Bayezid, managed to retain Sinope, and a large\r\nportion of the interior, for thirty years. He was father-in-law of the\r\nOttoman sultan, Murad II. When Clavijo visited Sinope in 1404 Isfendiar\r\nhad forty thousand men to put in the field against the Osmanlis. It was\r\nnot until after the fall of Constantinople that Kastemuni finally lost\r\nits independence.[765] As the history of this emirate is involved with\r\nthat of Sinope, see also below under Sinope.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEREDEH (25)\r\n\r\nThis was a small emirate, sometimes called also Kerdeleh, between\r\nKastemuni and Boli, which was absorbed by the Osmanlis in the latter\r\npart of the reign of Orkhan. It was already in danger of Ottoman\r\naggression when Ibn Batutah visited it on his way from Brusa to\r\nKastemuni.[766]\r\n\r\n\r\nKERMASTI (26)\r\n\r\nOn the Adranos River, one day south of Mikhalitch, and two days west of\r\nBrusa, this city was conquered by Orkhan in his first campaign after the\r\nfall of Nicomedia.[767]\r\n\r\n\r\nKERMIAN (27)\r\n\r\nKermian, or Guermian, took its name from a Turcoman chief who held\r\nKutayia about 1300. It was the earliest definite emirate which arose in\r\nwestern Asia Minor after the dissolution of the Seljuk Empire.\r\nShehabeddin wrote: ‘Turkish tribes seized the greater part of the Seljuk\r\npossessions. The Turks recognized the pre-eminence of the emir of\r\nKermian.’ The great fortress which still crowns the hill of Kutayia is\r\nsupposed to have been erected by Kermian.[768] Kermian’s son Ali became\r\nmaster of all of Phrygia, possibly at one time including Angora in his\r\nemirate. Orkhan wrote to Ali as equal to equal, and gave him the title\r\nof ‘emir of Anatolia’.[769] Ali had forty thousand horsemen and seven\r\nhundred castles and villages. He was the equal of the emir of Karamania\r\nand more powerful than Orkhan.\r\n\r\nKermian was the first of the larger emirates to feel the change which\r\nthe successes in the Balkan peninsula had made in the fortune of the\r\nOsmanlis. A granddaughter of the older Ali, and great-granddaughter of\r\nKermian, was married to Bayezid, and Murad compelled the emir of Kermian\r\nto cede the north-western portion of his estates as his daughter’s\r\n_dot_. When Bayezid made his first campaign against Karamania he annexed\r\nthe remainder of Kermian. The emir, his brother-in-law Yakub, fled to\r\nTimur, and was restored. The Osmanlis definitely incorporated Kermian in\r\ntheir empire in the second decade of the fifteenth century.[770]\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMNIA (28)\r\n\r\nA small emirate in the mountains between Trebizond and Erzindjian, whose\r\nemir, Tasheddin, married the daughter of the emperor of Trebizond in\r\n1379. In 1386, Tasheddin could put an army of twelve thousand men into\r\nthe field. There were several other very small Turkish emirates around\r\nTrebizond. Not enough, however, is known of them to make it worth while\r\nto mention them.[771]\r\n\r\n\r\nMARASH (29)\r\n\r\nAn independent emirate was established here after the fall of the\r\nLusignans in Cilicia, which was also known by the name of the founder of\r\nthe dynasty, Sulkadir. It maintained its independence against the\r\nKaramanians, Egyptians, and Osmanlis until 1515, when its last prince\r\nfell in a battle with Selim.[772]\r\n\r\n\r\nMARMORA (30)\r\n\r\nAn emirate on the borders of the Sea of Marmora, between Cyzicus and the\r\nDardanelles, which had struggles and alliances with the Catalans,\r\nByzantines, and Turks of Balikesri. It became a vassal state of Karasi,\r\nand was ruled from Pergama. After the destruction of Karasi, its\r\nterritory was shared by the Catalans of Bigha and by Orkhan.[773]\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTESHE (31)\r\n\r\nLike Hamid, Menteshe was of late formation. The chief who gave his name\r\nto this emirate was a contemporary of Orkhan, and was sometimes known by\r\nthe same name. He was allied by marriage to Soleiman, son of Aïdin,\r\nthrough whom he gained the former possessions of Aïdin south of the\r\nMaeander River. The emirate probably started at Mughla, and did not have\r\nmuch importance until it had absorbed Tawas and most of Fukeh. The emir\r\nof Menteshe possessed great influence during the latter part of Orkhan’s\r\nreign and the reign of Murad, and, like Aïdin and Sarukhan, the Turks of\r\nMenteshe, through their trading, were more in contact with the outside\r\nworld than were the Osmanlis. Their port, known to the Venetians as\r\nPalatchia, was the ancient Miletus. The emirate of Menteshe suffered\r\ndecline in the latter days of Murad’s reign through the Venetian\r\nusurpation at Palatchia. At the time of Bayezid’s invasion, the emir\r\nfled to Sinope and then to Timur. The emirate was restored by Timur, and\r\nwas not definitely incorporated in the Ottoman empire until the reign of\r\nMurad II.[774] (_See_ Fukeh, Palatchia, and Tawas.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMIKHALITCH (32)\r\n\r\nThis was one day west of Brusa and a day south of Mudania. After the\r\nfall of Brusa, Turkish or Byzantine rulers maintained themselves in\r\nMikhalitch until the expedition of Orkhan against Karasi. After that it\r\nbecame Ottoman.[775] Some of the prisoners held for ransom after\r\nNicopolis were detained in Mikhalitch, and one of the most illustrious\r\nof them died there.[776]\r\n\r\n\r\nNAZLU (33)\r\n\r\nThis was a small emirate east of Denizli, which was absorbed by Hamid\r\nabout 1350.[777]\r\n\r\n\r\nNICAEA (34)\r\n\r\nShehabeddin says that Nicaea was the centre of an emirate whose ruler\r\npossessed eight cities, thirty fortresses and an army of eight thousand\r\nhorsemen. The emir was Ali, a brother and neighbour of Sarukhan. I have\r\nbeen unable to identify this place.[778]\r\n\r\n\r\nPALATCHIA (35)\r\n\r\nLike Ayasoluk in relation to Aïdin, Palatchia, the ancient Miletus, in\r\nrelation to Menteshe was at times independent, and at times the capital\r\nand seaport of the emirate. Clavijo confused Palatchia with Ayasoluk,\r\nand claimed that Timur summered (he means wintered) there. In another\r\nplace he speaks of having travelled with a brother of Alamanoglu,\r\nbrother of the emir of Altoluogo _and_ Palatchia.[779] When Menteshe had\r\nhis capital at Mughla, there was undoubtedly another emir at Palatchia,\r\nwho might also have been the man spoken of above as emir of Fukeh. But\r\nthere can be no certainty on this point. Venice, from 1345 to 1405--and\r\nlater--was interested in Palatchia, and had a consul and large\r\ncommercial interests there. Different negotiations and treaties, in\r\nwhich the Osmanlis do not figure, attest the interest of Venice, and the\r\nindependence--at least from the Osmanlis--of Palatchia throughout the\r\nfourteenth century.[780] Cyprus and Rhodes at times tried to get the\r\nsupremacy of Palatchia.[781]\r\n\r\n\r\nSARUKHAN (36)\r\n\r\nSarukhan was throughout the fourteenth century an emirate of far more\r\nimportance than its rather restricted territory would seem to indicate.\r\nThis was largely on account of the high qualities of its rulers and the\r\ndaring of its sailors. It extended from the Gulf of Smyrna on the south\r\nto the Aegaean coast opposite Mitylene on the north, and was wedged in\r\nbetween Aïdin and Karasi. The hinterland was indefinite, and did not\r\nmatter much as the Turks of Sarukhan were first and last mariners. They\r\nwere the most important factor in the triple alliance against Orkhan in\r\n1329 and 1336. After the Ottoman occupation of Pergama, and the\r\ndisappearance of Karasi, they held the Osmanlis back for a hundred years\r\n(with the exception of the few years of Bayezid’s invasion). They were\r\nfrequently in alliance with the Genoese of Phocaea and the Byzantines,\r\nand hired out as mercenaries and for transporting troops and food to\r\nChristian and Moslem alike. The long lease of life which Philadelphia\r\nenjoyed as a city of the Byzantine Empire is witness of their friendly\r\nrelations with the Greeks throughout the reigns of Osman, Orkhan, and\r\nMurad.[782] Magnesia was capital of this emirate. It was not destroyed\r\nuntil Smyrna fell into the hands of the Osmanlis in 1425.[783]\r\n\r\n\r\nSATALIA (37)\r\n\r\nSatalia is listed as an emirate separately from Tekke for the same\r\nreason that Ayasoluk is given separately from Aïdin, Palatchia\r\nseparately from Menteshe, and Sinope separately from Kastemuni. It began\r\nand ended as a separate and independent emirate, with its own lord. Its\r\nhistory is treated below under Tekke. The modern name of Satalia is\r\nAdalia, from _Attaleia_, and gives its name to the gulf on the southern\r\ncoast of Asia Minor. Nicolay has confused Satalia with Ayas, the ancient\r\nIssos.[784]\r\n\r\n\r\nSINOPE (38)\r\n\r\nAn emirate was founded about 1307 in Sinope by the last descendant of\r\nthe Seljuks of Rum, who was known as Ghazi Tchelebi[785] who in 1313,\r\nin co-operation with the Greeks of Trebizond, attacked Kaffa. But in\r\n1318 we find the Turks of Sinope burning almost all of the city of\r\nTrebizond, and in 1323 massacring the Genoese colony in their own city.\r\nSoon after this the emir of Kastemuni conquered Sinope.[786] The Turks\r\nof Sinope were to the Black Sea what those of Sarukhan were to the\r\nAegaean. In 1361 they nearly captured Kaffa.[787] Their later history is\r\nthat of Kastemuni.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIVAS (39)\r\n\r\nThe history of Sivas between the time of the Mongol withdrawal and the\r\naggression of the Osmanlis is not known. But that it must have had\r\nindependent princes can be inferred from the story of how Kadi\r\nBurhaneddin came to rule there (cf. above under Caesarea). Its\r\ndisastrous conquest by the Osmanlis, and then by Timur, has been told in\r\nthe chapter on Bayezid’s reign.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAWAS (40)\r\n\r\nThis was a maritime emirate extending east into Lycia and west as far as\r\nthe mainland opposite Rhodes. It was the only one of the early emirates\r\nto possess islands. Its pirates were true descendants of those whom\r\nPompey opposed, and were continually in conflict with the Rhodians and\r\nCypriotes. Tawas was absorbed by Tekke and Menteshe, but not before\r\n1340.[788]\r\n\r\n\r\nTEKKE (41)\r\n\r\nTekke grew up into a powerful emirate in Pamphylia and Lycia. Its\r\nexpansion to the north was stopped by the Taurus, and to the west by\r\nAlaïa and Karamania. Tawas, which it later absorbed, Menteshe, Rhodes,\r\nand Cyprus were its other great rivals. Its history is centred around\r\nthe city of Adalia, then called Satalia, in which there were merchants\r\nof the larger Italian cities. Adalia was taken from the emirs of Tekke\r\nin 1361, but they regained it when the Genoese were threatening\r\nFamagusta in 1373. The Osmanlis, under Murad, crossed the Taurus by way\r\nof Sparta, into Tekke, but failed to capture Adalia. It remained\r\nindependent until 1450.[789]\r\n\r\n\r\nTOKAT (42)\r\n\r\nThis city was either under the Mongols or independent throughout the\r\nfourteenth century. Its fortunes were similar to those of Caesarea and\r\nSivas.\r\n\r\n\r\nULUBAD (43)\r\n\r\nThis city, between Bithynia and Mysia, was conquered by Osman, and then\r\nlost. It came again into the power of the Osmanlis in Orkhan’s campaign\r\nof 1339. A relative or ally of Andronicus III lived there.[790]\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENT CHRISTIAN STATES\r\n\r\nThere were two Christian states in Asia Minor during the fourteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nLITTLE ARMENIA (44), so called to distinguish it from the classical\r\nArmenia of the upper Euphrates valley and the mountains between Asia\r\nMinor and the Azerbaïdjan, was a portion of Cilicia in the south-eastern\r\ncorner of Anatolia, south of the Taurus mountains. A dynasty of Armenian\r\nkings, who had successfully held off the Seljuks of Konia, and had\r\nmaintained its position in the fourteenth century by siding with the\r\nMongols and Tartars against the Egyptians, was overthrown between 1360\r\nand 1374 in three invasions by the Egyptians, who made Tarsus their\r\nfrontier fortress.[791] Ahmed ben Ramazan, however, in 1379 established\r\na Turkish emirate at Adana, which survived throughout the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The Osmanlis were masters of a portion of Hungary before their\r\npower was felt in Cilicia.\r\n\r\nTREBIZOND (45), in the north-eastern corner of the peninsula, in the\r\ncountry where Mithridates in his kingdom of Pontus had defied the\r\nRomans, came into no contact with the Osmanlis during the century. Nor\r\nwas it the object of aggression on the part of Timur.[792] It resisted\r\nsuccessfully, with its Greek and Laze population, on land and sea, the\r\nattacks of the Turks of its hinterland and of Sinope.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRITORIES DEPENDING ON OUTSIDE STATES\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the Gulf of Smyrna, on the northern promontory, was the\r\nGenoese self-governing colony of PHOCAEA (46), of which much has been\r\nsaid in the chapter on the reign of Orkhan. Phocaea had many\r\nvicissitudes, but maintained its independence as a Latin colony\r\nthroughout the fourteenth century, and knew how to turn aside the\r\npossible aggression of Timur. It was never even temporarily dependent\r\nupon the Osmanlis.[793]\r\n\r\nSMYRNA (47) was wrested from the emir of Aïdin by the crusaders of 1344,\r\nand, for the rest of the fourteenth century was a Christian city,\r\nindependent of the Osmanlis and the Turkish emirs alike. It was Timur\r\nwho brought it again under Moslem control. But it did not pass to the\r\nOsmanlis for many years after this reconquest.\r\n\r\nThe Byzantines, after they had been driven out of Bithynia and Mysia,\r\nmanaged to maintain PHILADELPHIA (48), through their friendship with\r\nSarukhan, until the end of Murad’s reign.\r\n\r\nThe CYPRIOTES (49) exercised a powerful influence in the southern\r\nportions of Asia Minor throughout the fourteenth century. As we have\r\nseen, they held Adalia for some years. In 1360, the emirs of southern\r\nAnatolia were so divided and opposed to each other, and needed so\r\ngreatly the help of Cyprus against the Karamanians, whom they feared\r\nmuch more than the Osmanlis, that they became for many years tributary\r\nto Cyprus.[794] The Cypriotes were also interested in Cilicia.\r\n\r\nIn 1327, the year after Osman’s death, the power of the MONGOLS (50)\r\nreached for a few years the Mediterranean. After Bahadur Khan’s death,\r\nin 1335, the Mongol Empire was divided up. Suzerainty in Asia Minor fell\r\nto the Sultan of Irak (Persia), who, until Timur’s coming, fought with\r\nthe Karamanians for some of the most important cities of eastern\r\nAnatolia. When Ibn Batutah went through the peninsula, Erzerum,\r\nErzindjian, Sivas, Caesarea, Amassia, Nigdeh, and Ak Seraï were ‘cities\r\nof the Sultan’.[795]\r\n\r\nThe chevaliers of RHODES (51) did not come into Asia Minor until 1310,\r\nwhen they won from the Turks and Greeks the island which was to give\r\nthem their most commonly used name. They were continually in conflict\r\nwith Tawas, Alaïa, Adalia, Tekke, Menteshe, Fukeh, and Aïdin. But they\r\nnever came into contact with the Osmanlis until after the fall of\r\nConstantinople. On the mainland, the chevaliers helped to take Smyrna in\r\n1344, and defended it against the Turks for sixty years. They wrested\r\nAyasoluk from Aïdin for a while about 1365. Several times they gained a\r\nfoothold in Fukeh and Menteshe, and in the last year of the century\r\nestablished a fortress at Halik (Halicarnassus).[796]\r\n\r\nThe Mamelukes of EGYPT (52) were not only interested in Cilicia, and\r\nheld that country from 1360 to 1379, and at other times, but also\r\ninvaded Karamania on different occasions. They reached Konia at the end\r\nof the thirteenth century, the beginning of the fifteenth century, and\r\nagain, under Ibrahim pasha, twice in the third decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. During the reign of Murad I, the Egyptians called Cilicia up to\r\nthe Taurus _Bab-el-Mulk_, the Royal Gateway. Konia was entered by an\r\nEgyptian Sultan in 1418. The Karamanians of that day, who, according to\r\nthe Ottoman historians, were vassals of the Osmanlis, had no interest in\r\nor fear of Mohammed I. They were engaged in a civil war which led to\r\nEgyptian intervention.[797] If Konia and the rest of Karamania was under\r\nthe Osmanlis, why was there not Ottoman intervention in the quarrel\r\nbetween Mohammed and Ali for the Karamanian throne?\r\n\r\nLast of all, the CATALANS (53), whose history is given in the chapter on\r\nOsman, did not all leave Asia Minor with the ‘Grand Company’. Throughout\r\nthe reign of Orkhan the principality established at Cyzicus left its\r\ntraces in the Marmora and Dardanelles coast and hinterland. Nothing more\r\nstrikingly illustrates the lack of Ottoman activity in Asia Minor during\r\nOrkhan’s day, even at the very threshold of Bithynia, than the fact that\r\nhe left the Catalans in possession of Bigha at his death. Murad, in\r\n1363, although his presence was urgently needed on the Maritza to defend\r\nhis new conquest of Adrianople against a Serbian invasion, was compelled\r\nto delay for months to eject the Catalans from Bigha.[798]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n_Orkhan’s emirate, then, was but one of more than thirty independent\r\nstates which existed in Asia Minor during the decade from 1330 to 1340._\r\nDuring his lifetime, and the lifetime of his father Osman, the other\r\nbetter-known emirates had been slowly forming by the absorption of small\r\nindependent villages and cities. Although several of the emirates that\r\nhave been given above were ephemeral, and some of them duplicated\r\npractically the same territory at different periods in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, others, such as Aïdin, Kermian, Karamania, Sarukhan, and Tekke,\r\nwere far more powerful in Asia Minor than Orkhan or than Murad. That\r\nBayezid had not crushed the life out of the larger emirates is proved by\r\nthe ease with which they were revived by Timur, and by their survival\r\nduring the first half of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nKaramania, for one, remained powerful and flourishing long after the\r\npolitical life of the Balkan states had become extinct. Karamania\r\ndemanded one hundred years of strenuous effort on the part of the\r\nconquerors of the Byzantine Empire before it could be subjugated. _The\r\nOsmanlis crossed the Balkans more than a century before they crossed the\r\nTaurus._\r\n\r\nThis exposé was written in order to show:\r\n\r\n1. That Osman fell heir to no part of the Seljuk dominions;\r\n\r\n2. That the Seljuks had many more heirs than the traditional ten;\r\n\r\n3. That Osman and Orkhan carved their state out of the remnants of the\r\nByzantine possessions along the upper end of the Sea of Marmora and in\r\nthe Valley of the Sangarius--a very small portion indeed of Asia Minor;\r\n\r\n4. That Murad, the wonderful conqueror of the Balkan peninsula, was only\r\none of several rulers in Asia Minor, and not the most powerful of these,\r\nand that there were large portions of Asia Minor with which neither he\r\nnor his successor Bayezid came into contact at all;\r\n\r\n5. That neither Bayezid, with his tremendous prestige in Europe, nor his\r\nbrilliant successors of the fifteenth century, gained undisputed\r\npossession of Asia Minor. The Osmanlis were not masters of Asia Minor\r\nuntil long after their inheritance of the Byzantine Empire was regarded\r\nin Europe as a _fait accompli_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL TABLES\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Schéfer, in preface to his translation of Riza Kouly’s\r\nembassy to Kharesm, _Bibl. de l’École des langues viv. orientales_,\r\n1re série, vol. iii., says that Kharesm in part was identical\r\nwith Khorassan. But Shehabeddin, trans. by Quatremère in _Notices et\r\nExtraits_, xiii. 289, declares that Kharesm is a country distinct from\r\nKhorassan. Hadji Khalfa, _Djihannuma_, MS. fr., Bibl. Nat., Paris,\r\nnouv. ac., no. 888, p. 815, supports this opinion. The very fact that\r\nthese writers are so careful to make this assertion shows, however,\r\nthat there was much confusion as to these terms. According to Vambéry,\r\nKharesm is still in Djagatai Turkish, the diplomatical and political\r\nname for the modern Khanate of Khiva. Howorth, _History of Mongols_,\r\nii. 78, says that the Turkish tribes remained in these countries after\r\nthe Mongol conquest. Is this the Organa or Urgheuz of Marco Polo?\r\n\r\n[14] Hussein Hezarfenn, ii. 287, and Chalcocondylas (_Patr. Graec._,\r\nMigne, vol. clix), 21, call the father of Ertogrul Oguzalp. For\r\ncritical discussion see Appendix A.\r\n\r\n[15] This title is invariably given by Neshri to every ruler in the\r\ndirect line of Osman, just as he calls the Christian opponents of the\r\nOsmanlis unbelievers.\r\n\r\n[16] Probably Sultan Inoenu, anticipating the later name of this\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n[17] Sagredo, the Italian historian, whose work was greatly esteemed by\r\nGibbon, makes the curious error of calling Alaeddin ‘Lord of Aleppo and\r\nDamascus’.\r\n\r\n[18] ‘A great mountain situated between Kutayia and Brusa’: Hadji\r\nKhalfa, _Djihannuma_, fol. 1975; ‘The paths up this mountain are so\r\ndifficult that one on foot has a thousand pains to reach the top’:\r\nibid., fol. 1850.\r\n\r\n[19] Rasmussen, _Annales Islamici_, p. 41, confuses this city with\r\nKutayia, and gives its capture by Ertogrul under date of 1285.\r\n\r\n[20] Thus in Ali and Neshri. Seadeddin attributes this dream to\r\nErtogrul. But the confusion between Ertogrul and Osman is marked in all\r\nthe Ottoman historians.\r\n\r\n[21] The Ottoman historians give as reason for the refusal the social\r\ndifference between his daughter and the ‘young prince’. This is an\r\nexcellent illustration of how, writing in the zenith of Ottoman\r\nprosperity, the historians lost their sense of proportion or were\r\nactually compelled to write in flattering terms of the founder of their\r\nroyal house.\r\n\r\n[22] Hammer, i. 67, in relating this dream, has transcribed with\r\nfidelity and felicity the Persian poetry of Idris.\r\n\r\n[23] Leunclavius, _Pandectes_, p. 113, following Ali, attributes the\r\nmoon dream to Ertogrul, and places it at Konia. Boecler, _Commentarius\r\nde rebus turcicis_, pp. 104-5, following Chalcocondylas, does likewise,\r\nbut relates the Koran dream of Osman. Seadeddin, p. 11, makes the\r\ndream distinctly religious, and while not mentioning the love story\r\nor Malkhatun by name, infers that Osman receives intimation of his\r\nmarriage with Edebali’s daughter only through Edebali’s interpretation\r\nof the dream. This failure to mention Malkhatun is all the more\r\nsignificant when we see later how much attention Seadeddin gives to\r\nNilufer. Evliya effendi, ii. 19, says that through the marriage of\r\nOsman to Malkhatun, the Ottoman sultans became descendants of the\r\nProphet!\r\n\r\n[24] I should except from this statement Rambaud, who, in _Hist.\r\ngénérale_, iii. 822-4, states that the conversion of the Osmanlis\r\nto Islam took place during the chieftainship of Osman. The general\r\ncharacter of the work to which he was contributing, and the limits\r\nof space, did not allow him to give any reasons in support of this\r\nposition. Vanell, _Histoire de l’Empire ottoman_, p. 357, says that\r\nErtogrul was a pagan until he became converted through reading the\r\nKoran.\r\n\r\n[25] From personal acquaintance with them, I can testify that these\r\nnomads (Yuruks) have remained up to the twentieth century with only the\r\nmost vague idea of Mohammed and with no idea at all of the Koran and\r\nthe ritual observances of Islam.\r\n\r\n[26] See Shehabeddin, MS. Paris, Bibl. Nat., fonds arabe 2325, fol. 69\r\nvº-70 rº, citing Mesoudi and earlier writers for the propagation of\r\nIslam among the Bulgarians.\r\n\r\n[27] Cf. Cahun’s masterly contribution to _Hist. générale_, ii. 887.\r\n\r\n[28] Abul Faradj, _Chronicon Syr._, pp. 606-8.\r\n\r\n[29] The Ottoman historians mention none, either of friendship or\r\nenmity, during the entire life of Osman.\r\n\r\n[30] The improbable connexion between Ertogrul and Osman and the\r\nSeljuk sovereigns of Konia has been accepted without question by\r\nEuropean historians, on the strength of the assertions of the\r\nOttoman historians. This is curious, because the evidence against\r\nthis connexion is overwhelming. The Seljuk Empire of Rum lost its\r\nindependence at the battle of Erzindjian, 1244 (cf. Heyd, _Histoire\r\ndu commerce dans le Levant_, i. 534). Neshri himself confesses that\r\nafter this date ‘now remained only the bare name of the Seljuk Kings’:\r\n_ZDMG._, xiii. 195. In view of the established facts of history, it\r\nis astonishing that European historians should have up to this time\r\nperpetuated, and given their sanction to, a fiction which was invented\r\nfor the purpose of helping Mohammed II to incorporate Karamania in his\r\nempire! The limits of a footnote forbidding the adequate discussion\r\nof this question and the citation of the authorities, I must refer my\r\nreaders to Appendix A.\r\n\r\n[31] Neshri, _ZDMG._, xiii. 196, says seventy years. But in his\r\nreckoning he constantly contradicts himself. _Sheïr_ means city, _eski_\r\nold, and _yeni_ new.\r\n\r\n[32] All the Ottoman historians agree upon this number.\r\n\r\n[33] ‘The unbelievers and believers of that land honoured Ertogrul and\r\nhis son’: Neshri, p. 197. That Christians lived everywhere without\r\nmolestation in the midst of non-converted Turkish tribes is asserted by\r\nHeyd, ii. 65.\r\n\r\n[34] It is altogether likely that Osman received his name at the time\r\nof his conversion. Is it not significant that his father, his brothers,\r\nhis son even, as well as most of his warriors, had purely pagan Turkish\r\nnames?\r\n\r\n[35] _Tableau de l’Empire ottoman_, iv. 373.\r\n\r\n[36] See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n[37] During the late war with the Balkan allies, the newspapers of the\r\nworld spoke of ‘driving the Turks back to Asia, where they belong’, and\r\nof the re-establishment of the Ottoman capital at Brusa or Konia!\r\n\r\n[38] See Armain’s translation of the _Djihannuma_ (Mirror of the\r\nWorld), a universal geography by Hadji Khalfa, in the Bibl. Nat.,\r\nParis, MS., fonds français, nouv. ac., nos. 888-9. The section on Asia\r\nMinor, although written in some detail, does not contain many of the\r\nnames which we find in the Ottoman historians. I wish to register a\r\nprotest against inflicting on students and readers of history lists of\r\nnames that can have no possible meaning to them. I have omitted from\r\nthis work the names of places and persons upon which I can get no light.\r\n\r\n[39] Hadji Khalfa, op. cit., fol. 1917, makes an error in giving the\r\ndistance from Brusa to Yeni Sheïr as two days. I have driven from Brusa\r\nto Nicaea in one day of not fast going. Yeni Sheïr is on the main road\r\nbetween these cities, six hours from Brusa and four hours from Nicaea.\r\n\r\n[40] The early European historians make the wildest statements about\r\nOsman’s field of action. Many of them call Ottomanjik, a place\r\nfour days or five north-east of Eski Sheïr, his first conquest:\r\nCuspianus (Antwerp ed., 1541), p. 6; Spandugino, in Sansovino, p.\r\n143; Egnatius, p. 28. Cf. Hadji Khalfa, op. cit., fol. 1789. But this\r\nplace was not captured by the Osmanlis until the reign of Bayezid:\r\nEvliya, op. cit., ii. 95. Paulo Giovio, an Italian historian greatly\r\nesteemed in his day, puts among the notable conquests of Osman the\r\ncity and district of Sivas, as does also Rabbi Joseph, in his famous\r\n_Chronicles_, Eng. trans. of Biallobotzky, ii. 505. Donado da Lezze,\r\n_Historia Turchesca_, Rumanian edition of Ursu, pp. 4 and 5, makes him\r\nconqueror of Rum, province of Sivas, Phoenicia, ‘et altri luoghi’!\r\nCuspianus, _De Turcarum Origine_, quotes Donado da Lezze almost\r\nliterally. Richer, _De Rebus Turcarum_, written for the information\r\nof Francis I of France, says, p. 11: ‘Circiter 1300, Ottomannus\r\nimpune invitis omnibus _summam imperii_, quod ante partitum tenebant\r\nfactiosi magistratus, _occupavit_, seseque Asiae minoris sive Anatoliae\r\n_imperatorem_ nominare sit aggressus. _Syvam_, quae eadem cum Sebaste\r\nest, _expugnavit_, et oppida ad Euxinum posita _non pauca_ cepit.’ (The\r\nitalics are mine.) Hussein Hezarfenn, one of the Ottoman historians\r\nwhose work has been most widely read and quoted in Europe, says of\r\nErtogrul, _who never saw the sea_, ‘He equipped several ships, with\r\nwhich he made a raid into the Aegaean Sea, pillaged the islands,\r\ndescended upon Greece, penetrated up to the Peloponnesus, and returned\r\nto his home (_the little village of Sugut!_) laden down with wealth\r\nand followed by a great army composed of experienced warriors of all\r\nsorts of nations whom the renown of his bravery and his good fortune\r\nattracted to his service: which increased so greatly his reputation in\r\nAsia that Sultan Alaeddin even found it to his advantage to cultivate\r\nhim’: trans. of _Petits de la Croix_, ii. 288-9.\r\n\r\n[41] I am not sure that I am justified in using the expression\r\n‘undisputed sway’ even for this small territory. Pachymeres, IV. 30,\r\npp. 345-7, speaks of a certain Soleiman pasha, who was threatening\r\nNicomedia in 1303; and V. 23, p. 427, of Alisur retiring to the\r\nSangarius after Roger had relieved Philadelphia in 1307.\r\n\r\n[42] Probably the first conquest of Osman. This city, on the Kara Su,\r\nis still a thriving place. Its situation is most picturesque. The\r\nauthor of the _Arabic History of the Kurds_ (Bibl. Nat., Paris, MS.\r\nof Ducaurroy, fol. 151 rº, 152 rº) makes Biledjik the city granted to\r\nErtogrul by Alaeddin, and declares that he captured Sugut (Sukidjeh)\r\nfrom the ‘infidels of Tekkur’.\r\n\r\n[43] Angelcoma of the Byzantines.\r\n\r\n[44] The only conquest of Osman not in the direction of Byzantium.\r\nHadji Khalfa, op. cit., fol. 1851.\r\n\r\n[45] ‘Situated between Yeni Sheïr, Brusa, and Aïnegoel. They count one\r\nday from Yeni Sheïr to Yar Hissar by the road which goes to Kutayia’:\r\nHadji Khalfa, fol. 1917.\r\n\r\n[46] The Ottomans name this place Kuyun Hissar. See Schéfer edition of\r\nSpandugino, p. 16 _n._\r\n\r\n[47] Pachymeres, IV. 25, p. 327, says the battle was fought July 27.\r\nJorga, _Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches_, i. 157, is in error in\r\nplacing date June 27; Hammer, i. 190, and Jorga both give year 1301.\r\nMuralt, _Chronographie Byzantine_, ii. 480, has this battle under 1302.\r\n\r\n[48] Pach., IV. 25, p. 335.\r\n\r\n[49] Cantemir, Rumanian ed., i. 20, seems to infer that Osman attacked\r\nNicomedia after this battle. He is certainly wrong in stating that\r\nOsman captured Kutayia. See pp. 274, 292-3.\r\n\r\n[50] Pach., V. 9; Gregoras, VII, i, p. 214.\r\n\r\n[51] Pach., in Stritter, _Memoriae Populorum_, iii. 1086-7; D’Ohsson,\r\n_Histoire des Mongols_, iv. 315.

When did the bishops of these\r\ndioceses begin to be appointed and consecrated _in partibus_?\r\n\r\n[72] Bosio, op. cit., ii. 37; Abbé Vertot, _Histoire des Chevaliers de\r\nMalte_, i. 106.\r\n\r\n[73] See Bosio, ii. 37 f., and Vertot, i. 101 f. With a view to\r\nglorifying the Order, and also the Duke of Savoy, this fiction has been\r\nfabricated and perpetuated. Even such a serious work as that of Muralt\r\ngives, upon the strength of Raynaldus, who merely quotes Bosio, Osman\r\nas leader of this attack upon Rhodes: see _Chronographie Byzantine_,\r\nii. 507. During the recent war between Italy and Turkey, when it was\r\na question of Rhodes, more than one leading Italian newspaper revived\r\nthis story of the founder of the Italian royal house defeating the\r\nfounder of the Ottoman royal house. There is, of course, no foundation\r\nwhatever for the statement.\r\n\r\n[74] So Clement V evidently believed. See his letter to the Genoese in\r\n_Epistola Comm._ vii. 10.\r\n\r\n[75] That the Sangarius used to run into the Gulf of Nicomedia instead\r\nof into the Black Sea is the opinion of many geographers, ancient as\r\nwell as modern. There have been a number of projects to connect the\r\nSangarius, Lake Sabandja, and the Gulf of Nicomedia by canals that\r\nwould give a deep waterway across the plain and prevent the frequent\r\noverflooding which has always been a source of loss to cultivators in\r\nthat region.\r\n\r\n[76] Idris, quoted by Hammer, i. 192.\r\n\r\n[77] Brusa is three hours by carriage from its port on the southern\r\nside of the Gulf of Mudania, or one hour by narrow-gauge railway. One\r\ncan reach Nicaea either from the Gulf of Mudania or that of Nicomedia.\r\n\r\n[78] Pach., VII. 18, pp. 597-9.\r\n\r\n[79] Pach., VII. 25, p. 620. The Turks call this castle Hodjahissar.\r\n\r\n[80] Ibid., loc. cit. But Pachymeres puts the number of these Tartars\r\nas 30,000, which must be at least a tenfold exaggeration.\r\n\r\n[81] Seadeddin, translation Brattuti, p. 27. Bratutti, whose\r\ntranscription of Turkish names is often unintelligible to me, calls\r\nKaradja Hissar ‘Codgia’.\r\n\r\n[82] Ibn Batutah, _Voyages_, ii. 320, speaks of buildings which must\r\nhave been erected at these baths by Orkhan within the decade following\r\nthe capture of Brusa. Earlier buildings, according to him, were\r\nconstructed ‘by a Turcoman king’: ibid., p. 318. Tchekirdje is still a\r\nfavourite resort for foreigners as well as for natives.\r\n\r\n[83] Cantacuzenos and Gregoras.\r\n\r\n[84] Greg., IX. 2, p. 401.\r\n\r\n[85] Cant., I. 42, pp. 204-6, 208; Greg., VIII. 15, p. 384; Greg., IX,\r\nc. 1, pp. 390-2, says it was the young Andronicus who first planned to\r\nbreak again with his grandfather. However that may be, the impression\r\namong the Greeks in Asia Minor who were endeavouring to hold back the\r\nenemies of the empire must have been the same!\r\n\r\n[86] Greg., IX. 1, p. 392.\r\n\r\n[87] In the volume on ‘L’Ancien Régime’ in Taine’s _Origines de la\r\nFrance contemporaine_, pp. 3-6, there is a wonderful analysis of the\r\neffect of early Latin Christianity upon the pagan mind. The Greek\r\nChurch of the fourteenth century could produce no such impression.\r\n\r\n[88] From the earliest Ottoman times to the present day religion and\r\nnationality have not been divorced. Osmanli and Moslem were synonymous\r\nterms, just as to-day in the Balkan peninsula, where the Ottoman\r\nEmpire was really founded, Turk and Moslem are synonymous terms. When\r\nonce this is understood, the student and traveller is freed from his\r\npreconceived notion that the ‘Turks’, as that expression is to-day\r\nunderstood in Turkey, are an Asiatic race, who have held the country as\r\nconquering invaders.\r\n\r\n[89] Jorga, i. 162, is mistaken in saying, ‘überall wurden die\r\nGoldmünzen Osmans gern angenommen.’ Hadji Khalfa says that Osman struck\r\nno money. Also Colonel Djevad bey, _Histoire militaire de l’Empire\r\nottoman_, i. 95. Save several silver pieces, which are not proven\r\ngenuine, of the collection of Abbé Sestini (Salaberry, _Hist. de l’Emp.\r\nott._, iv. 193), I can find record in numismatic collections of no\r\nmoney of Osman. For discussion of this question see Hammer, i. 117, who\r\ncites several Ottoman historians against coinage before Orkhan, and\r\nToderini, _Historia della letteratura ottomana_, French trans., iii.\r\n183.\r\n\r\n[90] Appendix B, on the Emirates of Asia Minor during the Fourteenth\r\nCentury, contains the identification and description of these\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n[91] See Shehabeddin, Paris MS., 139 vº, which is cited in part on p.\r\n70.\r\n\r\n[92] The chieftainship among the Turks was elective rather than\r\nhereditary. The Armenian Haython, who had excellent opportunities for\r\nobserving their customs at this period, wrote: ‘Puisque les Turcs\r\npristrent la seigneurie de Turquie, ilz ordonnerent un seigneur entre\r\neulx, lequel ilz appelerent le Soudan’: MS. Bibl. Nat., Paris, fonds\r\nfrançais, 2810, fol. 230 vº. Hussein Hezarfenn says (ii. 287-9) that\r\nErtogrul succeeded his father by election and, in turn, manœuvred\r\nto secure the election of Osman. Evliya effendi, i. 27, declares\r\nthat Osman was elected chief. This is also stated by Barletius, in\r\nLonicerus, vol. ii, fol. 231-2; Spandugino; Cantemir (Rumanian ed.), i.\r\n19; and Vanell, p. 359. Cf. Chalcocondylas (ed.

Cf. II. 13, p. 390.\r\n\r\n[107] I have gathered the account of this battle from Cant., II.\r\n6-8, pp. 341-60; Greg., IX. 9, pp. 433-5; Phr., I. 7, pp. 36-7;\r\nChalcocondylas (ed. Migne), I. 11, col. 32. It is interesting to note\r\nhow much space Cantacuzenos gives in contrast to the brevity of the\r\nother writers.\r\n\r\n[108] II, c. 8, 363. Seadeddin, Neshri, and Idris agree with Gregoras,\r\nIX. 13, p. 458, in putting the fall of Nicaea in 1330 or 1331. Gregoras\r\neuphemistically says the city was ‘pillaged by the Turks’. But\r\nLeunclavius, on the authority of Ali, gives A.H. 734, which would be\r\n1333 or 1334.\r\n\r\n[109] Phr., I. 7.\r\n\r\n[110] In _Djihannuma_, Paris MS., fol. 1934.\r\n\r\n[111] When I was in Nicaea in 1913, the imam of the Yeshil Djami told\r\nme that there were seventy thousand houses at the time of the Ottoman\r\nconquest. This is the local tradition.\r\n\r\n[112] Hammer, i. 146, makes this claim.\r\n\r\n[113] Ibn Batutah, ii. 322-3. For discussion of the value of Ibn\r\nBatutah’s testimony see Appendix B and Bibliography.\r\n\r\n[114] Miklositch-Müller, Act. LXXXII, anno 1339, and Act. XCII, anno\r\n1340.\r\n\r\n[115] There is no way of establishing the date of the fall of\r\nNicomedia. The Ottoman historians report that it was added to the\r\ndominions of Orkhan in 1326, the year of his accession and of the fall\r\nof Brusa. It is best here to follow the unanimous testimony of the\r\nByzantine sources, which is in accord with the natural inference that\r\nNicomedia fell some time after Nicaea: Greg., XI. 6, p. 545; Phr.,\r\nI. 8, p. 38. Hammer cannot disregard the testimony of Gregoras here.\r\nHe ingenuously suggests that the city might have been lost by the\r\nOsmanlis, and recaptured. Cantacuzenos (II. 24, p. 446, and 26, p. 459)\r\nsays that Andronicus III went twice to the aid of Nicomedia in 1331,\r\nbut he does not record the loss of either Brusa or Nicomedia. In the\r\ncollection of Feridun, Bibl. Nat., Paris, MS. anc. fonds turc 79, there\r\nis a diploma appointing Soleiman governor of Nicomedia in 1332, but the\r\nauthenticity of the earlier pieces in this collection is open to grave\r\nsuspicion (cf. Bibliography).\r\n\r\n[116] Howorth, iii. 613.\r\n\r\n[117] Canale, i. 215.\r\n\r\n[118] Not an actual defensive alliance against Orkhan, as Schlumberger,\r\n_Numismatique de l’Orient latin_, p. 480, supposes.

(1911), lxv. 105, basing his statement,\r\nlike Hammer, on Ashikpashazadé, Vatican MS., fol. 33, gives\r\nA.H. 735, 737, or 740. The earliest of these dates is\r\nprecluded by the testimony of Ibn Batutah, who found these places still\r\nindependent about A.H. 735. A.H. 737\r\nmight be possible, if we decide that Orkhan accomplished everything\r\nduring the one expedition against Pergama. Mordtmann, still quoting\r\nAshikpashazadé, says that these three cities were held by relatives\r\nof the Palaeologi. If this be true, it goes to prove that there must\r\nhave existed all along in the reigns of Osman and Orkhan quasi-friendly\r\nrelations between Moslem and Christian. There was certainly no\r\nreligious fanaticism during this period of Ottoman history.\r\n\r\n[125] ‘Les Osmanlis avaient étendu leur domination en Asie Mineure et\r\nabsorbé les états dont l’indépendance avait jusqu’alors empêché l’unité\r\npolitique de l’Empire musulman!’ Delaville-Leroulx, _France en Orient\r\nau XIVe siècle_, i. 118. ‘Osmans Sohn Orkhan Kleinasien unterworfen\r\nhatte’: Wüstenfeld, _Geschichte der Türken_, p. 16. ‘Orkan s’impadroni\r\ndi quasi tutta la Natolia’: Alberi, in preface (viii) to series III,\r\nvol. i, of _Relazione Ven. Amb._ One of the earliest western historians\r\ngives Orkhan’s ambition as ‘solus cupiens in minore Asia regnare’:\r\nCervarius, p. 5. Even Hammer, i. 150, is considerably ahead of time\r\nin saying, in one of his chapters on Orkhan, ‘Les hordes ottomanes se\r\nprécipitèrent du haut de l’Olympe comme une avalanche, franchissant\r\nmontagnes et vallées, ajoutant à leurs possessions les neuf royaumes\r\nnés des débris de l’Empire seljukide, inondant Asie Mineure depuis\r\nl’Olympe jusqu’au Taurus.’ Hammer does not mean to give this wrong\r\nimpression, but one has to read very closely not to get it. See\r\ndiscussion of this error in Appendix B.\r\n\r\n[126] Cant., IV. 37, p. 284. Is it on the strength of this evident\r\nerror of a Greek writer that Evliya effendi, ii. 229, says ‘Orkhan\r\ncaptured Angora from the Prince of Kutayia of the Kermian family’?\r\nHussein Hezarfenn, following Chalcocondylas, is an example of an\r\nOttoman historian basing his statements on a Greek authority.\r\n\r\n[127] For the time of Ibn Batutah and Shehabeddin see Appendix B, p.\r\n279. Mas-Latrie, _Trésor de Chronologie_, col. 1796, after careful\r\ncollation of Shehabeddin and Ibn Batutah, comes to the conclusion\r\nthat Orkhan added the emirates of Balikesri, Marmara, Akbara, Kaouïa,\r\nKeredek, Kul Hissar, and Thingizlu to his state between 1349 and 1360.\r\nThis, too, is discussed in Appendix B.\r\n\r\n[128] Marmara, for example, is given by the Ottoman historians as a\r\nconquest made by Osman. See Hammer, i. 89. But it is mentioned as an\r\nindependent principality by Shehabeddin, in _Notices et Extraits des\r\nMSS. de la Bibl. du roi_, xiii. 358, 366.\r\n\r\n[129] Ibn Batutah, ii. 321-2.\r\n\r\n[130] Shehabeddin, Paris MS., fonds arabe 2325, fol. 139 vº-140 rº.\r\n\r\n[131] Ibid., fol. 125 vº.\r\n\r\n[132] Hammer, i. 110-11, says that Alaeddin, ‘stranger to the\r\nprofession of arms, occupied himself solely with the cares of state’,\r\nbut on p. 133 he has Alaeddin commanding the troops in battle while\r\nOrkhan watches from the top of a hill!\r\n\r\n[133] For the derivation of vizier, with the double meaning of\r\nburden-bearer and the one who aids, see Ibn Khaldun, _Prolegomena_, in\r\n_Notices et Extraits_, xx. 4.\r\n\r\n[134] Gen. xxviii. 11-18.\r\n\r\n[135] Sale’s translation, c. 20, verse 30, p. 234.\r\n\r\n[136] Col. Djevad bey, p. 20, _n._ 2. Col. Djevad claims that von\r\nHammer’s derivation of the word ‘pasha’ from the Persian is wrong.\r\nBut he gives no reason which would satisfy the philologist when he\r\nasserts that this word is essentially Turkish. Nor does he attempt to\r\nexplain its original meaning. ‘Pasha’ is probably a shortened form of\r\n‘padishah’. See _Century Dictionary_, v. 4228.\r\n\r\n[137] According to the biographer of Brusa, cited by Hammer, i. 146,\r\n_n._ 4.\r\n\r\n[138] I do not understand what Hammer means when he says, i. 116, that\r\nthe _Kanunnamé_ must be taken in the sense of political rather than\r\necclesiastical law. The two cannot be separated in Islam. Or, perhaps,\r\nit is better to say that there is no political law. The very word\r\n_Kanun_ was taken from the Greeks, was used by them for ecclesiastical\r\nlaw, and its adoption by the Osmanlis (at a much later period than\r\nOrkhan) serves to emphasize the fact that there was no other land of\r\nlaw conceivable than the law of the Church. The word _Kanun_ had of\r\ncourse other meanings, but in its collective legal sense it seems\r\nto have stood only for rules or laws that had to do with things\r\necclesiastical or religious. See the various meanings of this word in\r\nA. Souter’s _Text and Canon of the New Testament_ (London, 1913), pp.\r\n154-5.\r\n\r\n[139] This petition is in the Litany of the Prayer Book of Edward VI.\r\nCf. Schaff, _Church History_, iv. 151.\r\n\r\n[140] I do not mean to assert that religious feeling has played no part\r\nin the massacres of our own day. But these massacres were arranged\r\nby the government, who incited the Moslems to attack their Christian\r\nneighbours, inflaming the ignorant mind more by an appeal to racial\r\nhatred, to loot, to lust, than to defence of the sacred faith. In the\r\nArmenian massacres it was represented to the ignorant village Moslem\r\nthat the Armenians were plotting to set up an independent government or\r\nto betray the fatherland to some European power. I was in Adana during\r\nthe terrible massacre of 1909, and make this statement from personal\r\nexperience and observation.\r\n\r\n[141] Michail Koëzé, Marco, and Evrenos were Greeks. Cf. Leunclavius,\r\n_Pandectes_, p. 125.\r\n\r\n[142] Up to the time of the Tanzimat, in 1849, Christians were called\r\n_raïas_. The original meaning of _raïa_ was a flock, and was not a\r\nterm of contempt, but a recognition of the fact that Christians were a\r\ntaxable asset to the nation, at so much per head.\r\n\r\n[143] In western Asia Minor, in Macedonia and Thrace, up to the present\r\nday the convert to Islam, no matter of what race, is immediately\r\nclassified before the law as a Turk. When the Sublime Porte, after\r\nthe reoccupation of Adrianople in the summer of 1913, laid a memorial\r\nbefore the Powers, it was claimed that the large majority of the\r\npopulation of the vilayet of Thrace was ‘Turkish’. This word had\r\nabsolutely no racial significance. Every Mohammedan in Thrace, no\r\nmatter what his race or language, would be considered a Turk. The\r\nYoung Turks, when they established the Constitution in 1908, tried to\r\nrevive the word ‘Osmanli’ as a term including all Ottoman subjects. But\r\nthey not only failed to convince the nation--they failed to convince\r\nthemselves--that a Christian could really be an Osmanli, with the full\r\nrights and privileges enjoyed by the Moslems.\r\n\r\n[144] Ricaut, ed. 1682, p. 148. For confusion of the name ‘Turk’ with\r\n‘Saracen’ by early western writers, see _Chronique latine de Guillaume\r\nde Nangis_, Géraud ed., i. 46, 86-8; _Mémoires d’Olivier de la Marche_,\r\nBeaune and d’Arbaumont ed., i. 22-5, iv. 83; _Gilles le Muisit_,\r\nLemaître ed., p. 196. The mistake of Ricaut is common with many of the\r\nfifteenth-to seventeenth-century writers on the Crusades.\r\n\r\n[145] Matthew of Edessa (Urfa), fol. 8 of MS. Bibl. Nat., Paris, fonds\r\narménien, No. 95, quoted in _Notices et Extraits_, ix, 1^[ère] partie,\r\np. 281, speaks of ‘les calamités que des peuples barbares et corrompus,\r\ntels que les Turcs et les Grecs, LEURS SEMBLABLES, ont\r\ncausées’.\r\n\r\n[146] This was true even of the conquest of Constantinople, which\r\ncaused much more dismay and regret in Europe than among the Greeks. See\r\nthe remarkable letter of Francis Fielphus to Mohammed II in _Bibl. de\r\nl’École des langues vivantes orientales_, série 3, xii. 63-6, 211-14.\r\n\r\n[147] Cf. Rambaud in _Hist. Générale_, ii. 816.\r\n\r\n[148] In Constantinople, Smyrna, Salonika, and the lesser coast\r\ncities of the Ottoman Empire, as well as in many of the cities of the\r\ninterior, one feels the atmosphere of Sabbath rest much more on a\r\nSunday than on a Friday.\r\n\r\n[149] Evliya effendi, ii. 241.\r\n\r\n[150] In the _Djihannuma_, p. 951.\r\n\r\n[151] In a popular Anatolian love-song, there is the line, ‘Benim\r\nsevdijimie din var iman yok’, ‘She whom I love has religion, but not\r\na bit of faith’, which illustrates the lack of deep religious feeling\r\nin the Osmanli. In this he is like the Greek, and different from the\r\nSlav, the Persian and Arab. See Kúnos, _Zeitschrift der deutschen\r\nmorgenländischen Gesellschaft_, liii. 237.\r\n\r\n[152] At Balikesri the sultan Dambur told Ibn Batutah that ‘the men\r\nfollow the religion of their king’: ii. 317. Here was the principle of\r\n_cuius regio eius religio_ two centuries before Augsburg!\r\n\r\n[153] Col. Djevad bey, pp. 18-19.\r\n\r\n[154] Edward III of England had created a sort of obligatory military\r\nservice. His organized infantry took part in the Battle of Crécy, 1346.\r\nLavisse-Rambaud, _Hist. générale_, iii. 76.\r\n\r\n[155] Halil Ganem, i. 39.\r\n\r\n[156] This still holds.

An instance of a careful modern historian making this\r\nerror is found in Romanin, _Historia documentata di Venezia_, iii. 147,\r\nwhere he says, ‘La lega ... per raffrenare l’ognor erescente potenza\r\n_ottomana_.’\r\n\r\n[160] In Bongars, _Gesta Dei per Francos_, ii. 313.\r\n\r\n[161] This letter, from the manuscript in the Bibliothèque Nationale,\r\nParis, is published in _Bibl. de l’École des Chartes_ (1906), lxvii.\r\n587.

The name of St. Stephen was\r\ninvoked when they went into battle.\r\n\r\n[169] Orbini, _Il Regno degli Slavi_, p. 259, gives a circumstantial\r\naccount of the assassination. He says that Stephen gave the order to\r\nmen who strangled the old king in his cell at midnight. This does not\r\nprevent Orbini from saying later of Stephen ‘fu huomo molto pio’!\r\nBorschgrave, p. 266, is not certain of Stephen’s connivance.\r\n\r\n[170] J.

Hammer, i. 384-5, n. viii, says that Ottoman\r\nhistorians are unanimous in this assertion as against Byzantine\r\nsources. Col. Djevad bey, the modern Ottoman authority on military\r\nhistory, is disappointing and unconvincing in his discussion of\r\nthis question. On p. 25 he gives 726 (1326) for the date, and on p.\r\n78 730 (1329). He cites no sources, for there are none, and has to\r\nadmit, p. 54, that Murad I made the laws for the janissaries. Among\r\nearly European historians there is much divergency. Spandugino, p.\r\n185, attributes their origin to Osman, and the name from the village\r\nof Sar: they are ‘the young men of Sar’. Ricaut, ed. 1682, p. 357,\r\nalso attributes to Osman. Reineccius, influencing the Latin editor\r\nof Chalcocondylas (see ed. Migne, p. 26, _n._ 11), makes Osman the\r\nfounder, and derives the name from ‘Januae’: they are the _custodes\r\ncorporis_. Leuncl., _Pandectes_, p. 129, discusses these theories\r\nwithout coming to any conclusion. Giovio, Geuffraeus, and Nicolay, p.\r\n83, attribute origin to Murad II. Certainly it was not earlier than his\r\nday that the janissaries attracted attention in Europe. D’Ohsson, vii.\r\n311, asserts that there was no definite organization until Mohammed II.\r\nMignot, i. 119-20, is in favour of the theory that Murad I created this\r\ncorps.\r\n\r\n[261] Seignobos, in _Hist. générale_, ii. 334.\r\n\r\n[262] Col.

But exhausting struggles had been no less frequent and\r\nno less severe in the Balkan peninsula. Gibbon’s suggestion, that the\r\nlevies were made in Europe because Moslem and Christian Anatolians\r\nwere not apt for war, shows how completely the great English historian\r\nmissed the _raison d’être_ of the janissaries.\r\n\r\n[263] Hammer, i. 126.\r\n\r\n[264] Col.

As for the women of the lower classes, I have seen them\r\nalso. One of them will be, for example, in a cart drawn by horses. Near\r\nher will be three or four young girls.... The windows of the cart will\r\nbe open and you can see the women’s faces: _for the women of the Turks\r\nare not veiled_.... Often the woman is accompanied by her husband, whom\r\nwhoever sees him takes for one of her servants’: ii. 377-9. No student\r\ncan have any doubt whatever upon the position of Turkish women during\r\nthe fourteenth century. As among all vigorous peoples, the women of the\r\nOsmanlis held a high place, and were never secluded. It was not until\r\nMurad II that even the sovereign had a harem. The Moslem conception of\r\nthe inferiority of women was not prevalent among the Osmanlis until\r\nafter the reign of Soleiman the Magnificent. Immediately it became\r\nprevalent, the race began its decline.\r\n\r\nSo universal did veiling become in the seventeenth century that it\r\nwas adopted by Christian and Jewish women in Turkey as well.

But the commandant could hardly have been carried by his\r\nfalconer in such a fashion as far as Philippopolis. The Ottoman\r\nhistorians probably forgot that Ishtiman, at the mouth of the pass, on\r\nthe road to Philippopolis from Sofia, contained an Ottoman garrison.\r\n\r\n[380] According to the anonymous _Ein gantz neu Reysebuch von Prag auss\r\nbiss gen Constantinopel_, Nürnberg, 1622, p. 33, Sofia was captured in\r\n1362. Hadji Khalfa, _Rumeli_, p. 51, with whom Schéfer, ed. Bertrandon\r\nde la Broquière, p. 202 n., seems to agree by citing, says Sofia\r\ncapitulated in 780 (1378). Seadeddin, i. 125, is followed by Hammer, i.\r\n250, Klaić, p. 237, and others in fixing the date as 1382. But these\r\nsame authorities give 1375 and 1376 for Nish, which is altogether\r\nimpossible. Phr., I. 26, p. 80, seems to place the capture of Sofia\r\nfor 1385. This is the most reasonable date. It is consistent both with\r\nthe topography of the places in question and with Murad’s methods of\r\ncampaigning, as exemplified by all his conquests, to place the taking\r\nof Sofia close to the end of his reign, and within a year or two\r\nbefore the capture of Nish. To corroborate this date, letters in the\r\ncollection of Feridun can be cited. Indje Balaban’s letter to Murad,\r\nannouncing the acquisition of Sofia, is not dated. But immediately\r\nafter it is the response of Murad, in which he gives to Indje Balaban\r\nfor life the government of the new province, and states that he is\r\nsending him a fine horse and robes of honour because of his success.\r\nThis letter is dated from Adrianople in the middle of the month of\r\nRedjeb, 788, which corresponds to 1386 in our era. These letters are in\r\nMS. Bibl. Nat., Paris, fonds turc, No. 79, pp. 31-2.\r\n\r\n[381] Nish, from its geographical position, could not have fallen\r\nin 1375, as Chalcocondylas says. Hammer, i. 241, and Zinkeisen, i.\r\n230, show an amazing nonchalance in transporting the Osmanlis from\r\nKavalla, Drama, and Serres in the course of this one year, 1375. Engel,\r\n_Geschichte von Serbien_, p. 341, who, according to Hammer, ‘deceives\r\nhimself by thirteen years in placing the capture of Nish in 1388’, is\r\neleven years nearer the truth than Hammer! Strumnitza, from a diploma\r\ndelivered in the name of the Serbian empress Eudoxia (Müller, _Acta\r\nSerbica_, CXXXI), was independent in 1379. Sofia did not fall before\r\n1382.

But Ricaut, p. 296, thinks that it was\r\nbecause of dowry expense and the desire of the Ottoman sovereigns to\r\nkeep free from family alliances. Naturally, the difference of religion\r\nin time prevented the Osmanlis from finding brides for their sovereigns\r\namong the European royal families. If they married among their\r\nsubjects, there was always fear of intrigues in the wife’s family. At a\r\ntime when family alliances meant so much in Europe, the Ottoman Empire\r\nsuffered greatly from this disability.\r\n\r\n[442] Seadeddin, i. 158.\r\n\r\n[443] Klaić, p. 248. I think Romanin, iii. 331, has confused Stephen\r\nBulcovitch with Stephen Tvrtko. For it is difficult to understand what\r\nhe means by the ‘pace vergognosa’ with Venice.\r\n\r\n[444] Old Servian chronicle, quoted by Klaić, p. 271: ‘quasi totaliter\r\ndestruxerunt Bosniam et populum abduxerunt.’\r\n\r\n[445] Klaić, pp. 324-5.\r\n\r\n[446] Accounts differ as to the place. There is some doubt as to\r\nwhether the independence of Aïdin was totally destroyed before\r\nthe restoration of Isa’s sons by Timur. Cf. Schlumberger, p. 484;\r\nMas-Latrie, _Trésor de Chronologie_, col. 1800. Hammer, i. 300, cites\r\nno authorities for his statements about this usurpation.\r\n\r\n[447] Bosio, ii. 143.\r\n\r\n[448] Ibid., ii. 148.\r\n\r\n[449] There is the same dearth of information about the details of\r\nthe destruction of the power of the emirs of Sarukhan and Menteshe as\r\nthere is about Aïdin. Hammer says simply, ‘Les principautés de S. et M.\r\nfurent incorporées à l’empire ottoman,’ i. 300. He gives no authorities.\r\n\r\n[450] Ducas, 13, p. 47.\r\n\r\n[451] _Dialogi XXVI cum Persa quodam de Christianae religionis\r\nveritate_, Bibl. Nat., Paris, fonds grec, No. 1253: partly printed in\r\n_Notices et Extraits_, vol. viii, 2e partie, and in Migne, 156, pp.\r\n111-74. In _Notices et Extraits_, loc. cit., C. B. Hase has given an\r\ninteresting critical account of the dialogues, and the circumstances\r\nunder which they were written.\r\n\r\n[452] Seadeddin, i. 163. In Hammer, i. 301, in the sentence ‘quoique,\r\ndepuis la paix renouvelée avec lui par Orkhan, les deux nations eussent\r\ncontinuellement vécu dans des relations de sincère amitié’, is not\r\nMurad meant instead of Orkhan?\r\n\r\n[453] Evliya effendi, ii. 21, tells how Bayezid passed _seven times in\r\none year_ from Anatolia to Wallachia.\r\n\r\n[454] In matters relating to the progress of Ottoman conquest in Asia\r\nMinor, French, German, and British writers have been content to repeat,\r\nwithout critical comment, what they have culled from Leunclavius or\r\nthe translations of Seadeddin. In many cases, they have gone back no\r\nfarther than Hammer, and have transcribed, often literally, Hammer’s\r\nwords. Hammer himself, in this early period of Ottoman history, in\r\nspite of his attainments as an orientalist, has relied mainly on\r\nLeunclavius, and on Bratutti’s Italian translation of Seadeddin.\r\n\r\n[455] ‘La principauté _fut pour toujours réunie à l’empire_,’ Hammer,\r\ni. 308. In speaking of this second campaign, Hammer starts by saying,\r\n‘Le prince de Karamanie avait de nouveau _levé l’étendard de la\r\nrévolte_’. This is hardly the expression to use for the action of an\r\nindependent prince. Alaeddin had never made himself the vassal of the\r\nOttoman emirs.\r\n\r\n[456] Striking testimony to the later power of the Karamanlis is given\r\nby Bertrandon de la Broquière, who visited the court of Ibrahim with\r\nthe Cypriote ambassador in 1443: cf. Schéfer’s edition of his voyage,\r\npp. 108-20. See Appendix B below, where the relations of the Osmanlis\r\nwith the emirates of Asia Minor during the fourteenth century are\r\ndiscussed in detail, with fuller citation of authorities.\r\n\r\n[457] Howorth, iii. 749.\r\n\r\n[458] Sherefeddin, iii. 256, who is the only contemporary authority,\r\nsays that Bayezid put him to death. This was one of the charges made by\r\nTimur against Bayezid.\r\n\r\n[459] The earliest possible date could be 1393. Perhaps the Osmanlis\r\nfirst appeared near Sivas at this time. But Bayezid would hardly have\r\nundertaken so long and perilous an expedition before his position was\r\nsecure in Karamania. Sherefeddin gives the more likely date 1395, while\r\nIbn-Hedjir places the death of Burhaneddin in 1396.\r\n\r\n[460] So d’Ohsson fils, vii. 442, says, but gives date 1390. Hammer\r\nmore correctly puts it in 1391. Xénopol, in his authoritative and\r\ncarefully documented history, gives a little different account of\r\nMircea’s early relations with Bayezid, and attributes to Mircea a\r\nlarger influence in the calculations of Murad than he deserves. But the\r\nexposition of Mircea’s policy in relation to Poland, Hungary, and the\r\nOsmanlis, as given by Xénopol, cannot be overlooked or disregarded by\r\nthe student of this period.\r\n\r\n[461] ‘Pierre Aron fut le premier des hospodars qui paya un tribut\r\naux Turcs’: Costin’s _Hist. de la Moldavie_, p. 367, in _Notices et\r\nExtraits_, vol. xi.\r\n\r\n[462] Phr., I. 13-14, pp. 58-9, and 26, p. 82; Bonfinius, iii. 2;\r\n_Chron.

Lützow, _Life and Times of Master John Hus_, p. 239).\r\nThis illustrates the Slavic conception of nationality, and explains\r\nin a nutshell the Austro-Hungarian and Balkan problems. To the Slav,\r\nthere can be no other test of nationality. The Bulgarian propaganda in\r\nMacedonia, carried on through the church and the schools, has been the\r\nresurrection of the nation through the language. The Greeks have used\r\nthe Orthodox Church to combat and stifle this movement. They claim as\r\nGreeks all members of the Orthodox Church, while the Bulgarians claim\r\nthat Bulgarophones, even if not attached to the exarchate, belong to\r\nthe Bulgarian nation.\r\n\r\n[468] Schiltberger, Neumann ed., p. 65. On this question cf. Jireček,\r\nop. cit., pp. 350-2; Miller, p. 189; and illuminating note of Rambaud,\r\nin _Hist. générale_, iii. 832 _n._ Also p. 143 of this book and\r\naccompanying foot-note.\r\n\r\n[469] Schiltberger, op. et loc. cit.\r\n\r\n[470] These cities, or rather, their fortresses, were captured and\r\nevacuated several times by the Osmanlis, especially Widin.\r\n\r\n[471] Hammer, at the beginning of the reign of Bayezid, i. 295-7,\r\nrelates the history of the quarrel between Andronicus and his father\r\nand Manuel, the rescue from the Tower of Anemas, &c., as if these\r\nevents happened in 1389 and 1390, and gives the capture of Philadelphia\r\nfor 1391. He has been led astray here by the story of Ducas, and by the\r\nfact that the Byzantine historians speak of Bayezid instead of Murad\r\nin connexion with the negotiations for restoration. By the internal\r\nevidence in the Byzantine historians themselves, the chronology of this\r\nperiod cannot be decided. But, by reading Phrantzes and Chalcocondylas\r\nin the light of Quirino, the continuation of Dandolo, and the archives\r\nof the colony of Pera, and also by piecing out the length of time of\r\nthese events and matching them with Bayezid’s occupations during the\r\nfirst two years of his reign, it is not difficult to decide to place\r\nthe Andronicus _versus_ John and Manuel struggles just before the\r\nChioggia war. At any rate, Andronicus died ten years before the date\r\nHammer gives to these events!\r\n\r\n[472] Poem cited by Muralt, ii. 738, No. 1.\r\n\r\n[473] MS. Bibl.

According to Schéfer, in his edition of\r\nBertrandon de la Broquière, p. 165, there was a provision that slaves\r\nescaping to Constantinople should be given back, but we cannot be\r\nsure that this stipulation was made under Bayezid I. The date of the\r\ninstallation of the cadi, &c., is open to question.

Wylie, i. 156, _n._ 2, gives the\r\ntime-worn popular derivation from εἰς τὴν πόλιν; also Telfer, in his\r\nedition of Schiltberger, p. 119. Why go so far afield? _Istambul_ is a\r\nnatural contraction of Constantinople. As the Greeks pronounced this\r\nlong word, the syllables _stan_ and _pol_ bore the stress, and were\r\nnaturally put together for a shortened form. As for the initial _I_,\r\nwhich has troubled the philologists, its explanation is easy to one who\r\nknows the Osmanlis. They cannot to this day pronounce an initial _St_\r\nwithout putting _I_ before it.\r\n\r\n[478] Neshri, trans.

Although the citations in the text of my\r\nnarrative are mostly from Froissart and Schiltberger, all chronicles\r\nand contemporary sources available have been used in the preparation\r\nof this section, especially Bellaguet’s edition of _Religieux de\r\nSaint-Denis_, ii. 425-30, 483-522 (Bellaguet’s notes, however, on these\r\nsections are very disappointing).\r\n\r\n[514] Froissart, pp. 218, 221, 223.\r\n\r\n[515] Ibid., pp. 227-8, 230, 394-8. A complete list of the chevaliers,\r\ncompiled from sources, is found in Buchon, and, in much more complete\r\nand accurate form, in Delaville Leroulx, ii. 78-86.\r\n\r\n[516] Froissart, and other earlier writers, have several ways of\r\ndesignating Bayezid. Froissart calls him Amorath-Baquin (p. 216),\r\nAmorath (p. 226), le roy Basaach, dit l’Amourath-Bacquin(p. 230),\r\nl’Amourath-Bacquin many times, and l’Amourath three times in one\r\nparagraph (p. 311). Chroniclers and writers of the fifteenth century\r\nwere continually confusing Bayezid with Murad (cf. Cuspianus,\r\nSecundinus, Sylvius Aeneas, Donado da Lezze, Paolo Giovio, _et\r\nal._). From the different ways Froissart designates Bayezid, it is\r\nvery clear that he is not mixing him with Murad, but that by ‘dit\r\nl’Amourath-Bacquin’ he means ‘_l’émir-pacha_’. The fact that he uses\r\nthe definite article so frequently and says several times ‘l’Amourath’\r\nis proof positive of this. His transcription of the title _emir_, and\r\nthat of many other western writers, led later historians to think the\r\nchroniclers meant Murad! It is merely a coincidence that the words are\r\nso similar. Froissart, however, would be capable of mistaking Murad\r\nfor Bayezid. On p. 216 he calls Sigismund Henry, and on p. 334 Louis!\r\nOlivier de la Marche (éd. Beaune et d’Arbuthnot), i. 83-4, speaks twice\r\nof ‘Lamourath-bahy’. Here, too, there is not a confusion of Murad and\r\nBayezid. He, like Froissart, means to say ‘l’amiral-pacha’. On ‘amiral’\r\nfor ‘emir’ see above, p. 163, _n._ 2.\r\n\r\n[517] Froissart, pp. 230-1, 242.\r\n\r\n[518] Donado da Lezze, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[519] Leunclavius, _Hist. Musul. Turc._, preface, p. 14, speaks of\r\nhow grateful Sigismund was later for the services rendered to him\r\npersonally by the Burgrave in the Nicopolis campaign, and that the\r\nfriendship formed then led to the later advancement of the house of\r\nBrandenburg.\r\n\r\n[520] Wylie, i. 6, 158, quoting Ducas, 13, and _Venetian State Papers_\r\n(Brown), i. 85. Ducas knew nothing of Nicopolis, while the Venetian\r\nreference is based on a misapprehension.\r\n\r\n[521] Lavisse, _Histoire de France_, iv. 311: ‘on l’avait vu à la\r\nbataille de Nicopoli sur les bords de la Baltique avec les chevaliers\r\n_teutoniques_.’ Lavisse has evidently mixed up the Nicopolis expedition\r\nwith the earlier Prussian one in which Henry did take part. His\r\nstatement on the same page that Henry IV took part in the Boucicaut\r\nexpedition is another error.\r\n\r\n[522] Conclusive proof of the whereabouts of Henry in the summer of\r\n1396 is found in the letter ‘escript ... le xxe jour d’augst’. This\r\nletter is in Arch. Nat., Paris, J. 644: 35^{11}. For the expeditions in\r\nwhich Henry _did_ take part, when he was Henry of Derby, see vol. lii\r\nof the Camden Society, edited by Lucy Toulmin Smith, London, 1894, 4to.\r\n\r\n[523] Froissart, p. 244.\r\n\r\n[524] Phr., I. 14, p. 59; Bontinius, III. 2.\r\n\r\n[525] Engel, _Geschichte der Bulgaren_, p. 468. According to the\r\nauthority who has made the most exhaustive study of the Nicopolis\r\nexpedition, Sigismund disposed of 120,000 men in all, including the\r\nwestern allies: Kiss, in _À Nikápolyi ülkozet_, p. 266. Kiss’s estimate\r\nis corroborated by the _Cronica Dolfina_, which says that Sigismund\r\nhad one hundred thousand men under arms in 1394. Sanuto quotes this in\r\nMuratori, xxii, col. 762.

Akademie_, 1869, ii. 271), tried to\r\nprove that the battle was fought, not at Nicopolis on the Danube, but\r\nnear the ancient Nicopolis of Trajan’s foundation. But in his notes to\r\nthe English translation of Schilt., Hakluyt, lviii. 108-9, he assents\r\nto the contention which Kanitz makes in _Donau-Bulgarien_, ii. 58-70,\r\nthat the battle was near Nicopolis-on-the-Danube. An examination of\r\nthe chronicles corroborates Kanitz’s hypothesis over against the\r\ningenuous argument of Jireček. Some historians have been so unmindful\r\nof geographical considerations as to put the battle at the ancient\r\nNicopolis _ad Haemum_, of which Ortellius, p. 225, speaks.\r\n\r\n[528] Schiltberger, p. 2.\r\n\r\n[529] Froissart, pp. 251, 262-3, 310, 329. ‘Miscreant’, of course, in\r\nits original sense.\r\n\r\n[530] Ibid., p. 310.\r\n\r\n[531] Ibid., pp. 311-17; _Relig. de St.-Denis_, pp. 490-7.\r\nSchiltberger, p. 3, attributes this initiative to Jean de Nevers, whom,\r\nlike many other writers on Nicopolis, he calls, by anticipation, Duke\r\nof Burgundy.

It is a pity that Hammer, in his description of the\r\nbattle of Nicopolis, relied so much on such an unreliable third-hand\r\nauthority as Abbé Vertot. Skentkláráy, _À dunai hajóhadak törtenéte_,\r\nsays that Jean de Vienne commanded the galleys.\r\n\r\n[539] Schiltberger, p. 6.\r\n\r\n[540] Bonfinius, one of the earliest Hungarian historians, recorded\r\nthat Sigismund had boasted that he would not only turn the Osmanlis out\r\nof Europe, but also that with the army under his command, if the sky\r\nfell, it could be held up on their lances: _Decades_, ii. 403.\r\n\r\n[541] ‘Sigismund was cruel and sensual, perjured and frivolous,\r\nrapacious and dissolute, fierce and pusillanimous, a byword and object\r\nof horror to the Bohemians, hated and despised by the Germans, a\r\nwarning to all rulers. His companion, John XXIII, lewd and murderous, a\r\nsimonist and an infidel, was a true comrade for Sigismund in all evil\r\ndeeds’: Dr. Flajshans, in _Mistr Jan Hus_: quotation translated by\r\nCount Lützow, _John Hus and his Times_, pp. 137-8.\r\n\r\n[542] Froissart, pp. 330-1.\r\n\r\n[543] But not until he ‘regracioit les dieux et les déesses selon la\r\nloy où il creoit et que les paiens croient’: Froissart, p. 321.

I have been unable to identify several of the\r\nplaces mentioned.\r\n\r\n[593] I have walked in one day from Riva to a point on the Bosphorus\r\nnot many miles above Constantinople.

Phr., 15, p.\r\n61, says that John, who had been in the court of Bayezid, fled to his\r\nuncle because he had been slandered to Bayezid, and was afraid for his\r\nlife; and Chalc., II, p. 84, that it was John who commanded the 10,000\r\nOsmanlis against the city, and that Manuel shared the throne with him\r\nin order to save the city.

Timur’s own\r\naccount of his march and the battle of Angora is very brief: ‘Je pris\r\nmoi-même le chemin d’Ancouriah. Bayezid, suivi de 400,000 hommes, tant\r\ncavaliers que fantassins, vint à ma rencontre; on livra la bataille, et\r\nje la gagnai. Ce Prince vaincu fut pris par mes troupes, et amené en\r\nma présence. Enfin ... je retournai victorieux à Samarcande’: Langlès\r\ntrans., p. 264.\r\n\r\n[624] A great deal has been written about the date of Angora, but all\r\nauthorities agree in putting it between July 20 and July 28, 1402. Cf.\r\n_Art de vérifier les Dates_, i. 193; Silvestre de Sacy, in _Mémoires\r\nde l’Académie des Inscriptions_, vi. 488-95; Moranvillé, in _Bibl. de\r\nl’École des Chartes_, lv. 437-8. A few early western writers have given\r\n1397 and 1403, while Petits de la Croix, in his French translation of\r\nSherefeddin, is a decade too late in all his dates. The latter part\r\nof July 1402 is fixed by all contemporary authorities on this battle.\r\nAbu’l-Mahasin, in his history of the reign of the Egyptian sultan\r\nBarkok, states that the greater part of Bayezid’s army perished by\r\nthirst before his capture.\r\n\r\n[625] On the nationality of the Tartars who betrayed Bayezid at Angora,\r\nsee the latter part of the note of Bruun on the ‘White Tartars’ in the\r\nHakluyt ed. of Schiltberger, pp. 114-17.\r\n\r\n[626] From the account of the Dominican Friar, pp. 458-9, it seems\r\nclear that Bayezid was the aggressor until after Soleiman’s command had\r\nbeen cut to pieces.\r\n\r\n[627] Sherefeddin, iv. 8-12; Dominican Friar, p. 458.\r\n\r\n[628] Afterwards Mohammed I. Many western writers have confused him\r\nwith his nickname of Kiritchelebi (Girigilibi in Rabbi Joseph, i. 257,\r\nand a variety of spellings in other early writers), and made him thus\r\nhis own father, to account for the later Sultan Mohammed.\r\n\r\n[629] In this battle I have used Sherefeddin, Arabshah, Dominican\r\nFriar, in _Bibl. de l’École des Chartes_, lv. 437-68, Schiltberger,\r\nClavijo, and the invaluable letters in Marino Sanuto, Muratori, xxii.\r\n794-7. The authorities for Angora and Timur are classified in the\r\nbibliography below.\r\n\r\n[630] Sherefeddin, iv. 15, says the carnage in this battle was seven\r\ntimes greater than in any of Timur’s previous victories. The Dominican\r\nFriar, p. 459, puts the Ottoman losses at 40,000.\r\n\r\n[631] Schiltberger, p. 21, says that he retreated to this hill with\r\n1,000 horsemen. Hammer is in error in saying that Bayezid ‘resisted\r\nlike a hero at the head of his _ten thousand_ janissaries with whom he\r\nhad occupied the slope of a hill’: ii. 91. There were never as many as\r\nten thousand janissaries enrolled in the Ottoman army until a century\r\nafter Bayezid’s death. See above, p. 119. In oriental historians\r\nnumbers are almost invariably exaggerated at least tenfold.\r\n\r\n[632] Solak-zadé, p. 63. Sherefeddin and Arabshah bear witness to\r\nBayezid’s personal courage.\r\n\r\n[633] The Ottoman historians explain the capture of Bayezid by the fact\r\nthat he was unhorsed. Some say that he was mounted on an inexperienced\r\nhorse. A great deal was written about the battle of Angora at a much\r\nlater date, but, as in describing the battles of Kossova and Nicopolis,\r\nI have limited myself to contemporary sources.\r\n\r\n[634] Mustafa’s fate was never cleared up. Mohammed and Isa fled naked,\r\naccording to the Dominican Friar, p. 450.\r\n\r\n[635] I am unable to agree with Alberi, _Rel. Ven. Ambasc._, 3rd\r\nser., vol. i, preface viii., ‘Secondo migliori testimonianze deve\r\nrigettarsi per falsa la tradizione’, and Bruun, Notes to Hakluyt ed. of\r\nSchiltberger, p. 21 _n._, ‘We are forced to conclude, after Hammer’s\r\nsearching inquiries, that there is no truth whatever in the story\r\nof Bayezid having been confined by Timur in an iron cage’. Hammer’s\r\narguments, ii. 96-101, do not seem to me at all convincing. From the\r\nphilological point of view, they have been refuted by Weil, _Gesch. der\r\nChalifen_, ii. 92. From the historical point of view, there is just\r\nas strong evidence for as against the litter with bars, which could\r\nhardly have been any different from a cage. If one argues that Timur\r\ndid not subject his prisoner to this indignity, and advances that the\r\ncage was really nothing more than a closed litter, such as was used for\r\nladies of the imperial harem, he is merely substituting one indignity\r\nfor another. From the character of Bayezid, one would infer that the\r\nhumiliation of being shut up like a lion in a cage would have been less\r\nthan that of being put into a harem litter like a woman, for whom the\r\nconqueror had contempt rather than fear. There is no mention of the\r\niron cage in Schiltberger, Clavijo, and the Dominican Friar. But their\r\nsilence signifies nothing. They are excellent witnesses for the battle\r\nof Angora itself, but knew little or nothing of what happened in Asia\r\nMinor after Angora. One might just as well argue from Schiltberger’s\r\nsilence that Timur did not capture Smyrna! Nor does Sherefeddin mention\r\nthe humiliation of Bayezid, and the iron cage. But the story is given\r\nin Arabshah, p. 210, who must be reckoned with as a contemporary\r\nsource. If, as de Salaberry, iv. 200-1, claims, the iron cage story was\r\ninserted in Arabshah by his Ottoman editor and translator, Nazmi-zadé,\r\nit only goes to show that the careful Ottoman students of his time\r\nbelieved the story. The Ottoman historians, who are _without exception_\r\ntoo late to be regarded as sources, and who had reasons for making\r\nthe degradation of the Ottoman sovereign as slight as possible, show\r\ntheir knowledge of the early and contemporary character of this record\r\nby trying to controvert it, and prove that Bayezid was carried on a\r\nlitter rather than in a cage, e. g. Seaddedin, i. 230. That the common\r\ntradition among the Osmanlis, outside of the court chroniclers who were\r\ncompelled to uphold at all costs the dignity of the house of Osman, was\r\nin favour of the cage story is proved conclusively by Ali Muhieddin,\r\nMigne ed., col. 597, who is earlier than Seadeddin, and by Evliya\r\neffendi, i. 29-30; ii. 21-22, who gives the story just as we find it\r\nin Arabshah and the western writers. Sagredo, who follows Spandugino,\r\nvigorously defends the cage story as opposed to the litter of the\r\nOttoman court chroniclers, and says that Bayezid died from striking\r\nhis head against the bars of his cage, pp. 25-6. In Lonicerus, fol.\r\n12 vº, is a picture of the cage. It is mentioned by Guazzo, fol. 275\r\nvº; Donato da Lezze, p. 10; Paolo Giovio; Geuffry, p. 283; Campana,\r\nfol. 8 vº; Egnatius, p. 30; Rabbi Joseph, i. 256; Sanuto, in Muratori,\r\nxxii. 791; Bonincontrius, col. 88; Formanti; and Timur’s early western\r\nbiographer, Perondino, p. 31, who, fifty years before Seadeddin, wrote\r\nthat Timur compelled Bayezid’s wife Despina to wait nude upon him and\r\nhis guests at table. The story is also found in Ducas, chapter 26.\r\n\r\n[636] Perondino, p. 31; Sagredo, p. 26; Campana, fol. 8 vº; Raynaldus\r\nand Spandugino; _Lettres d’un Solitaire turc_, i. 106-7. Exposure\r\nof women was a common symbol of conquest among the Mongols. It was\r\na formal ceremony at the sack of Pekin and Djenghiz Khan’s sack of\r\nSamarkand.\r\n\r\n[637] Many authorities declare that Bayezid committed suicide by\r\nstriking his head against the bars of his cage, being unable to support\r\nthe sight of his wife’s disgrace. The humiliation to which Despina was\r\nsubjected was often given in later times by the Osmanlis themselves as\r\na reason why the house of Osman does not contract marriages.

He answered that their law was a good one, and that they should\r\nassemble all their people in the chief synagogue. He promised that no\r\nharm would come to them. When the Tartars entered the city, they sealed\r\nfast the doors of this synagogue, and set fire to it.\r\n\r\n[640] Sherefeddin, iv. 37-48; Duc., 16, pp. 66-7.\r\n\r\n[641] Seadeddin, i. 235.\r\n\r\n[642] Sherefeddin, iv. 47, 52.\r\n\r\n[643] Accounts of the capture of Smyrna: Sherefeddin, iv. 47-53;\r\nChalc., III, p. 161; Duc., 18, p. 78; Hadji Khalfa, _Djihannuma_, fol.\r\n1949; Arabshah, ii. 24.

But this date is in Brunn’s note, p. 133, and not in\r\nSchiltberger’s narrative. According to Clavijo, fol. 57 rº, Timur died\r\nNovember 18, 1404, while Arabshah, p. 248, says ‘17 Saghan, 807’, which\r\nwould be in February 1405.

Chalcocondylas\r\nhimself is full of mistakes, and knew very little about the history of\r\nByzantium and the Osmanlis in the fourteenth century. But he is not\r\nas bad as his Latin translator, whom the historians have followed.\r\nIn order to trace some of the errors, I collated the Greek text of\r\nChalcocondylas with the Latin translation through the first two books\r\nof his history, which cover the period 1300-1403. The glosses and\r\nthe inexact translations are many. For example of glosses, in I. c.\r\n4 B, ‘quos Tartaros nominant’ after Scythis; I. c. 7 C, ‘Orthogulus\r\nadhibitus in colloquium’, at beginning of third sentence; I. c. 10 C,\r\n‘ex tribus, Orchanes nomine’, after ‘filius eius natu minimus’; I. c.\r\n12 C, ‘circiter viginti duo’ in the sentence ‘Orchanes cum regnasset\r\nannos mortem obiit’. For a very unfaithful translation compare Latin\r\nwith Greek original in I. c. 27, the end of A and beginning of B. In I.\r\nc. 28 C ἓξ καὶ τριάκοντα is translated ‘triginta _septem_’!

This is true also of\r\nHadji Khalfa, the famous bibliographer, in his _Djihannuma_, a work\r\nwhich I have tested and found incomplete and unreliable both in its\r\ngeographical and historical information about the region which gave\r\nbirth to Osman and his tribe.\r\n\r\n[673] Houdas, p. 374, foot-note 1.\r\n\r\n[674] Mohammed en Nesawi, p. 374.\r\n\r\n[675] Ibid., 394.\r\n\r\n[676] Ibid., 209, 328.\r\n\r\n[677] Shehabeddin, 230-9, 263-72, 289-91, in describing Khorussan,\r\nArmenia, and the strife between Djelaleddin and Alaeddin, makes no\r\nmention of Soleiman Shah or Ertogrul, or of a formidable invasion\r\nsuch as 50,000 families, under one ruler, would certainly have been\r\nregarded.

It does not appear for others than Kaï Kobad II in\r\nthe Arabic genealogies. Leunclavius is so confused by the discrepancy\r\nhere that he concludes that the Ottoman historians must have given\r\nthe name indiscriminately to all the Sultans! (_Pandectes_, 106).\r\nHadji Khalfa, _Djihannuma_, folio 1790, speaking of Amassia, says\r\nthat its fortress was repaired by ‘Sultan Alaeddin the Seljucide’. It\r\nis typically Ottoman to be vague about names as well as about dates.\r\nHadji Khalfa frequently speaks of an Ottoman Sultan, whose name is\r\nduplicated, without any following ordinal. There is often no clue in\r\nthe context to identify the Sultan to whom he refers.\r\n\r\n[692] As the year of the Hegira began in June in 1240, there is the\r\nalternative of reckoning the Christian era a year later during the\r\nmiddle period of this century. But I have not thought necessary to\r\nindicate this alternative each time.\r\n\r\n[693] Villani, book VI, c. 32, in Muratori, xiii, col. 175, describes\r\nthis battle; also _Vie de Saint Louis_, by Le Nain de Tillemont (ed.\r\nGaulle), iii. 4.\r\n\r\n[694] Abulfeda; Howorth, iii. 47.\r\n\r\n[695] This is the opinion of two of the ablest modern scholars, Heyd,\r\ni. 534, and Sarre, p. 41.\r\n\r\n[696] I can find no record of coins to controvert this statement.\r\nLane-Poole, _Mohammedan Coins in the Bodleian Library_, 41, gives only\r\none coin of the Bodleian collection after 641 of the Hegira, and to\r\nthis he assigns the date A.H. 663 with a question mark.\r\n\r\n[697] MS. Bib. Nat., Paris, fonds arabe, 583, folio 144 rº and vº.\r\n\r\n[698] The lists of coins in I. Ghalib Edhem’s _Monnaies turcomanes_\r\nalso bear eloquent testimony to the disappearance of Seljuk vassal\r\ndynasties during this period.\r\n\r\n[699] I have not heard of such a coin existing to-day, but make the\r\nstatement on the strength of Abulfaradj, _Chronicon Syr._, 527-8.\r\n\r\n[700] Abulfaradj, ibid., 542-3; Howorth, iii. 69.\r\n\r\n[701] Abulfeda, v. 15-16, under date of A.H. 662.\r\nVillani (in Muratori, xiii), VII. c. 40, column 261-2, describes how\r\nAbaka Khan chased the Saracens (_sic_) from ‘Turchia’, and also the ‘Re\r\nd’Erminia’, who ‘lasciò a’ Tartari la Turchia’.\r\n\r\n[702] Huart, _Souvenirs de voyage_, 164, speaks of the battle, but does\r\nnot mention occupation of Konia.\r\n\r\n[703] Abulfaradj, _Chronicon Arab._, 365-7; d’Ohsson, _Histoire des\r\nMongols_, ii. 570-80; Howorth, iii. 295.\r\n\r\n[704] Howorth, iii. 315.\r\n\r\n[705] _Konia, Ville des Derviches tourneurs_, 177.\r\n\r\n[706] ‘Ils sont souspost an Tartar de Levant, qui y met sa seigneurie.’\r\nEdition of Pauthier, 37. For status of this country at the beginning\r\nof the thirteenth century, see _Chronique d’Ernoul et de Bernard le\r\nTrésorier_ (ed. Mas-Latrie, Paris, 1871), pp. 377, 381.\r\n\r\n[707] Hadji Khalfa naïvely solves this doubt by rolling Masud and Kaï\r\nKobad into one and the same person. _Djihannuma_, folio 1752 _bis_.\r\n\r\n[708] There is no way of reaching certainty on this point. Rasmussen,\r\n_Annales Islamici_, pp. 34-8, reflects the confusion which attended\r\nthe scholar of the early nineteenth century who wanted to make a\r\nchronological table of the later Seljuk Sultans. The two best modern\r\ntables are to be found in Sarre and Huart, scholars who became\r\ninterested in the Seljuk problem through their archaeological travels\r\nin Asia Minor. The best account of the Seljuks is that of Houtsma in\r\nthe _Encyclopaedia Britannica_. It is to be regretted that Professor\r\nHoutsma has not published the French translation of Ibn Bibi, which he\r\npromised in his introduction to the 4th volume of the Leyden series of\r\nSeljuk texts. Three years ago, Professor Sir William Ramsay, who knows\r\nKonia better than any European scholar, told me that he felt there was\r\nrich reward for the research student in the Seljuk period. The history\r\nof the Seljuks of Konia has yet to be written.\r\n\r\n[709] Osman was the sole heir according to Boecler: also Donado da\r\nLezze, 4.\r\n\r\n[710] ‘Osman, Karaman, and Assam.

On p. 479, Saladin makes another curious statement\r\nto the effect that in 1300 the Osmanlis employed architects who had\r\nfortified the Seljuk strongholds. I have never been able to find in my\r\nreading or from observation of Ottoman constructions any authority for\r\nsuch an assertion.\r\n\r\n[729] i. 50. The _medressé_ is, as Seadeddin says, to the right after\r\nyou enter the Yeni Sheïr gate. The _imaret_ is near the Yeshil Djami,\r\nwhich is the oldest Ottoman mosque extant, dating from 1378. The imam\r\nof the Yeshil Djami told me that the imaret was built by Osman’s wife,\r\nMalkhatun. According to Seadeddin, however, Malkhatun died before Osman!\r\n\r\n[730] Parvillée, p. 6, says that the Oulou-Djami, which is attributed\r\nto Murad I in Brusa by popular consent, was not finished until the\r\nreign of Mahomet I.\r\n\r\n[731] Cf. preface of Parvillée; and Hammer, i. 83.\r\n\r\n[732] W.

There can be no doubt about this being an\r\nerror, for when Ibn Batutah visited the Ottoman domains, Orkhan was\r\nruling, and Nicaea had been captured. I put 1340 as latter limit,\r\nbecause Ibn Batutah speaks of some places captured by Orkhan before\r\n1340 as being still independent.\r\n\r\n[735] Quatremère, in _Notices et Extraits_, xiii. 152-3, cannot reach a\r\ndefinite conclusion as to whether Shehabeddin is from Damascus, Marash,\r\nor Morocco. But I find that Hadji Khalfa, _Dict. Bibl._, Paris MS.,\r\nfol. 1832, under no. 10874, records him as a ‘writer of Damascus’.\r\n\r\n[736] Bibl. Nat., Paris, fonds arabe 2325.

In the division of the Roman Empire\r\nin the fifth century, Cilicia is given under _Diocesis Oriens_ rather\r\nthan under _Diocesis Asiana_ with the rest of Asia Minor. To regard\r\nCilicia as belonging to Syria was common up to the days of Mehemet\r\nAli. Ibn Khaldun, _Notices et Extraits_, xix. 1^{ère} partie, p. 143,\r\nspeaks of Adana as being ‘at the extremity of Syria’, while Cilicia is\r\nincluded in Syria in Abdul Ali Bakri’s description of Africa, Bibl.\r\nNat., Paris, fonds arabe no. 2218, p. 103. Both the Latin and Orthodox\r\nChurches made Cilicia depend ecclesiastically upon Antioch: cf. Le\r\nQuien, _Oriens Christianus_, ii. col. 869, iii. col. 1181. But, in\r\nmodern times, we have come to regard this region as a portion of Asia\r\nMinor.\r\n\r\n[741] Shehabeddin, 339, 369; Ibn Batutah, ii. 295-310; Cant. ii. 28,\r\npp. 470-3; 25, p. 455, iii. 192; Greg. xvi. 6, p. 834; Ducas, 7, pp.\r\n29-30; 18, p. 79; Schlumberger, _Numismatique de l’Orient latin_,\r\n481-5; for Venice’s share in crusade against Smyrna, Romanin, iii. 147;\r\nfor complete list of princes, Karabeck, in _Numismatische Zeitschrift_,\r\nVienna, 1877, ix. 207.\r\n\r\n[742] Shehabeddin, 365.\r\n\r\n[743] Ibn Batutah, ii. 267.
