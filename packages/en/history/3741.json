This publisher was D. I. Eaton, who printed as\r\nthe first number of Paine's \"Crisis\" an essay taken from the London\r\npublication. But his prefatory note says: \"Since the printing of this\r\nbook, the publisher is informed that No. 1, or first Crisis in this\r\npublication, is not one of the thirteen which Paine wrote, but a\r\nletter previous to them.\" Unfortunately this correction is sufficiently\r\nequivocal to leave on some minds the notion that Paine did write the\r\nletter in question, albeit not as a number of his \"Crisis \"; especially\r\nas Eaton's editor unwarrantably appended the signature \"C. S.,\"\r\nsuggesting \"Common Sense.\" There are, however, no such letters in the\r\nLondon essay, which is signed \"Casca.\" It was published August, 1775,\r\nin the form of a letter to General Gage, in answer to his Proclamation\r\nconcerning the affair at Lexington. It was certainly not written by\r\nPaine. It apologizes for the Americans for having, on April 19, at\r\nLexington, made \"an attack upon the King's troops from behind walls and\r\nlurking holes.\" The writer asks: \"Have not the Americans been driven\r\nto this frenzy? Is it not common for an enemy to take every advantage?\"\r\nPaine, who was in America when the affair occurred at Lexington, would\r\nhave promptly denounced Gage's story as a falsehood, but the facts known\r\nto every one in America were as yet not before the London writer. The\r\nEnglish \"Crisis\" bears evidence throughout of having been written in\r\nLondon. It derived nothing from Paine, and he derived nothing from it,\r\nunless its title, and this is too obvious for its origin to require\r\ndiscussion. I have no doubt, however, that the title was suggested\r\nby the English publication, because Paine has followed its scheme in\r\nintroducing a \"Crisis Extraordinary.\" His work consists of thirteen\r\nnumbers, and, in addition to these, a \"Crisis Extraordinary\" and a\r\n\"Supernumerary Crisis.\" In some modern collections all of these have been\r\nserially numbered, and a brief newspaper article added, making sixteen\r\nnumbers. But Paine, in his Will, speaks of the number as thirteen,\r\nwishing perhaps, in his characteristic way, to adhere to the number\r\nof the American Colonies, as he did in the thirteen ribs of his iron\r\nbridge. His enumeration is therefore followed in the present volume, and\r\nthe numbers printed successively, although other writings intervened.\r\n\r\nThe first \"Crisis\" was printed in the Pennsylvania Journal, December\r\n19, 1776, and opens with the famous sentence, \"These are the times that\r\ntry men's souls\"; the last \"Crisis\" appeared April 19,1783, (eighth\r\nanniversary of the first gun of the war, at Lexington,) and opens with\r\nthe words, \"The times that tried men's souls are over.\" The great\r\neffect produced by Paine's successive publications has been attested by\r\nWashington and Franklin, by every leader of the American Revolution,\r\nby resolutions of Congress, and by every contemporary historian of the\r\nevents amid which they were written. The first \"Crisis\" is of especial\r\nhistorical interest. It was written during the retreat of Washington\r\nacross the Delaware, and by order of the Commander was read to groups of\r\nhis dispirited and suffering soldiers. Its opening sentence was adopted\r\nas the watchword of the movement on Trenton, a few days after its\r\npublication, and is believed to have inspired much of the courage which\r\nwon that victory, which, though not imposing in extent, was of great\r\nmoral effect on Washington's little army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS I. (THESE ARE THE TIMES THAT TRY MEN'S SOULS)\r\n\r\nTHESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the\r\nsunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their\r\ncountry; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man\r\nand woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this\r\nconsolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the\r\ntriumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness\r\nonly that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper\r\nprice upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an\r\narticle as FREEDOM should not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to\r\nenforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right (not only to TAX)\r\nbut \"to BIND us in ALL CASES WHATSOEVER,\" and if being bound in that\r\nmanner, is not slavery, then is there not such a thing as slavery upon\r\nearth. Even the expression is impious; for so unlimited a power can\r\nbelong only to God.\r\n\r\nWhether the independence of the continent was declared too soon, or\r\ndelayed too long, I will not now enter into as an argument; my own\r\nsimple opinion is, that had it been eight months earlier, it would have\r\nbeen much better. We did not make a proper use of last winter, neither\r\ncould we, while we were in a dependent state. However, the fault, if it\r\nwere one, was all our own*; we have none to blame but ourselves. But\r\nno great deal is lost yet. All that Howe has been doing for this month\r\npast, is rather a ravage than a conquest, which the spirit of the\r\nJerseys, a year ago, would have quickly repulsed, and which time and a\r\nlittle resolution will soon recover.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The present winter is worth an age, if rightly employed; but, if\r\nlost or neglected, the whole continent will partake of the evil; and\r\nthere is no punishment that man does not deserve, be he who, or what, or\r\nwhere he will, that may be the means of sacrificing a season so precious\r\nand useful.\r\n\r\nI have as little superstition in me as any man living, but my secret\r\nopinion has ever been, and still is, that God Almighty will not give up\r\na people to military destruction, or leave them unsupportedly to perish,\r\nwho have so earnestly and so repeatedly sought to avoid the calamities\r\nof war, by every decent method which wisdom could invent. Neither have I\r\nso much of the infidel in me, as to suppose that He has relinquished the\r\ngovernment of the world, and given us up to the care of devils; and as I\r\ndo not, I cannot see on what grounds the king of Britain can look up\r\nto heaven for help against us: a common murderer, a highwayman, or a\r\nhouse-breaker, has as good a pretence as he.\r\n\r\n'Tis surprising to see how rapidly a panic will sometimes run through\r\na country. All nations and ages have been subject to them. Britain has\r\ntrembled like an ague at the report of a French fleet of flat-bottomed\r\nboats; and in the fourteenth [fifteenth] century the whole English army,\r\nafter ravaging the kingdom of France, was driven back like men petrified\r\nwith fear; and this brave exploit was performed by a few broken forces\r\ncollected and headed by a woman, Joan of Arc. Would that heaven might\r\ninspire some Jersey maid to spirit up her countrymen, and save her fair\r\nfellow sufferers from ravage and ravishment! Yet panics, in some cases,\r\nhave their uses; they produce as much good as hurt. Their duration is\r\nalways short; the mind soon grows through them, and acquires a firmer\r\nhabit than before. But their peculiar advantage is, that they are the\r\ntouchstones of sincerity and hypocrisy, and bring things and men to\r\nlight, which might otherwise have lain forever undiscovered. In fact,\r\nthey have the same effect on secret traitors, which an imaginary\r\napparition would have upon a private murderer. They sift out the\r\nhidden thoughts of man, and hold them up in public to the world. Many\r\na disguised Tory has lately shown his head, that shall penitentially\r\nsolemnize with curses the day on which Howe arrived upon the Delaware.\r\n\r\nAs I was with the troops at Fort Lee, and marched with them to the edge\r\nof Pennsylvania, I am well acquainted with many circumstances, which\r\nthose who live at a distance know but little or nothing of. Our\r\nsituation there was exceedingly cramped, the place being a narrow\r\nneck of land between the North River and the Hackensack. Our force\r\nwas inconsiderable, being not one-fourth so great as Howe could bring\r\nagainst us. We had no army at hand to have relieved the garrison, had\r\nwe shut ourselves up and stood on our defence. Our ammunition, light\r\nartillery, and the best part of our stores, had been removed, on the\r\napprehension that Howe would endeavor to penetrate the Jerseys, in\r\nwhich case Fort Lee could be of no use to us; for it must occur to every\r\nthinking man, whether in the army or not, that these kind of field forts\r\nare only for temporary purposes, and last in use no longer than the\r\nenemy directs his force against the particular object which such forts\r\nare raised to defend. Such was our situation and condition at Fort Lee\r\non the morning of the 20th of November, when an officer arrived with\r\ninformation that the enemy with 200 boats had landed about seven miles\r\nabove; Major General [Nathaniel] Green, who commanded the garrison,\r\nimmediately ordered them under arms, and sent express to General\r\nWashington at the town of Hackensack, distant by the way of the ferry\r\n= six miles. Our first object was to secure the bridge over the\r\nHackensack, which laid up the river between the enemy and us, about six\r\nmiles from us, and three from them. General Washington arrived in about\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, and marched at the head of the troops towards\r\nthe bridge, which place I expected we should have a brush for; however,\r\nthey did not choose to dispute it with us, and the greatest part of our\r\ntroops went over the bridge, the rest over the ferry, except some which\r\npassed at a mill on a small creek, between the bridge and the ferry, and\r\nmade their way through some marshy grounds up to the town of Hackensack,\r\nand there passed the river. We brought off as much baggage as the wagons\r\ncould contain, the rest was lost. The simple object was to bring off\r\nthe garrison, and march them on till they could be strengthened by the\r\nJersey or Pennsylvania militia, so as to be enabled to make a stand.\r\nWe staid four days at Newark, collected our out-posts with some of\r\nthe Jersey militia, and marched out twice to meet the enemy, on being\r\ninformed that they were advancing, though our numbers were greatly\r\ninferior to theirs. Howe, in my little opinion, committed a great error\r\nin generalship in not throwing a body of forces off from Staten Island\r\nthrough Amboy, by which means he might have seized all our stores\r\nat Brunswick, and intercepted our march into Pennsylvania; but if we\r\nbelieve the power of hell to be limited, we must likewise believe that\r\ntheir agents are under some providential control.\r\n\r\nI shall not now attempt to give all the particulars of our retreat to\r\nthe Delaware; suffice it for the present to say, that both officers\r\nand men, though greatly harassed and fatigued, frequently without rest,\r\ncovering, or provision, the inevitable consequences of a long retreat,\r\nbore it with a manly and martial spirit. All their wishes centred in\r\none, which was, that the country would turn out and help them to drive\r\nthe enemy back. Voltaire has remarked that King William never appeared\r\nto full advantage but in difficulties and in action; the same remark may\r\nbe made on General Washington, for the character fits him. There is a\r\nnatural firmness in some minds which cannot be unlocked by trifles, but\r\nwhich, when unlocked, discovers a cabinet of fortitude; and I reckon it\r\namong those kind of public blessings, which we do not immediately see,\r\nthat God hath blessed him with uninterrupted health, and given him a\r\nmind that can even flourish upon care.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this paper with some miscellaneous remarks on the state\r\nof our affairs; and shall begin with asking the following question, Why\r\nis it that the enemy have left the New England provinces, and made these\r\nmiddle ones the seat of war? The answer is easy: New England is not\r\ninfested with Tories, and we are. I have been tender in raising the\r\ncry against these men, and used numberless arguments to show them their\r\ndanger, but it will not do to sacrifice a world either to their folly\r\nor their baseness. The period is now arrived, in which either they or\r\nwe must change our sentiments, or one or both must fall. And what is a\r\nTory? Good God! what is he? I should not be afraid to go with a hundred\r\nWhigs against a thousand Tories, were they to attempt to get into arms.\r\nEvery Tory is a coward; for servile, slavish, self-interested fear is\r\nthe foundation of Toryism; and a man under such influence, though he may\r\nbe cruel, never can be brave.\r\n\r\nBut, before the line of irrecoverable separation be drawn between us,\r\nlet us reason the matter together: Your conduct is an invitation to the\r\nenemy, yet not one in a thousand of you has heart enough to join him.\r\nHowe is as much deceived by you as the American cause is injured by you.\r\nHe expects you will all take up arms, and flock to his standard, with\r\nmuskets on your shoulders. Your opinions are of no use to him, unless\r\nyou support him personally, for 'tis soldiers, and not Tories, that he\r\nwants.\r\n\r\nI once felt all that kind of anger, which a man ought to feel, against\r\nthe mean principles that are held by the Tories: a noted one, who kept a\r\ntavern at Amboy, was standing at his door, with as pretty a child in his\r\nhand, about eight or nine years old, as I ever saw, and after speaking\r\nhis mind as freely as he thought was prudent, finished with this\r\nunfatherly expression, \"Well! give me peace in my day.\" Not a man lives\r\non the continent but fully believes that a separation must some time or\r\nother finally take place, and a generous parent should have said, \"If\r\nthere must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have\r\npeace;\" and this single reflection, well applied, is sufficient to\r\nawaken every man to duty. Not a place upon earth might be so happy as\r\nAmerica. Her situation is remote from all the wrangling world, and she\r\nhas nothing to do but to trade with them. A man can distinguish himself\r\nbetween temper and principle, and I am as confident, as I am that God\r\ngoverns the world, that America will never be happy till she gets clear\r\nof foreign dominion. Wars, without ceasing, will break out till that\r\nperiod arrives, and the continent must in the end be conqueror; for\r\nthough the flame of liberty may sometimes cease to shine, the coal can\r\nnever expire.\r\n\r\nAmerica did not, nor does not want force; but she wanted a proper\r\napplication of that force. Wisdom is not the purchase of a day, and it\r\nis no wonder that we should err at the first setting off. From an excess\r\nof tenderness, we were unwilling to raise an army, and trusted our\r\ncause to the temporary defence of a well-meaning militia. A summer's\r\nexperience has now taught us better; yet with those troops, while they\r\nwere collected, we were able to set bounds to the progress of the enemy,\r\nand, thank God! they are again assembling. I always considered militia\r\nas the best troops in the world for a sudden exertion, but they will not\r\ndo for a long campaign. Howe, it is probable, will make an attempt on\r\nthis city [Philadelphia]; should he fail on this side the Delaware, he\r\nis ruined. If he succeeds, our cause is not ruined. He stakes all on his\r\nside against a part on ours; admitting he succeeds, the consequence will\r\nbe, that armies from both ends of the continent will march to assist\r\ntheir suffering friends in the middle states; for he cannot go\r\neverywhere, it is impossible. I consider Howe as the greatest enemy the\r\nTories have; he is bringing a war into their country, which, had it not\r\nbeen for him and partly for themselves, they had been clear of. Should\r\nhe now be expelled, I wish with all the devotion of a Christian, that\r\nthe names of Whig and Tory may never more be mentioned; but should the\r\nTories give him encouragement to come, or assistance if he come, I\r\nas sincerely wish that our next year's arms may expel them from the\r\ncontinent, and the Congress appropriate their possessions to the relief\r\nof those who have suffered in well-doing. A single successful battle\r\nnext year will settle the whole. America could carry on a two years' war\r\nby the confiscation of the property of disaffected persons, and be made\r\nhappy by their expulsion. Say not that this is revenge, call it rather\r\nthe soft resentment of a suffering people, who, having no object in view\r\nbut the good of all, have staked their own all upon a seemingly doubtful\r\nevent. Yet it is folly to argue against determined hardness; eloquence\r\nmay strike the ear, and the language of sorrow draw forth the tear\r\nof compassion, but nothing can reach the heart that is steeled with\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\nQuitting this class of men, I turn with the warm ardor of a friend to\r\nthose who have nobly stood, and are yet determined to stand the matter\r\nout: I call not upon a few, but upon all: not on this state or that\r\nstate, but on every state: up and help us; lay your shoulders to the\r\nwheel; better have too much force than too little, when so great an\r\nobject is at stake. Let it be told to the future world, that in the\r\ndepth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that\r\nthe city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to\r\nmeet and to repulse it. Say not that thousands are gone, turn out your\r\ntens of thousands; throw not the burden of the day upon Providence, but\r\n\"show your faith by your works,\" that God may bless you. It matters not\r\nwhere you live, or what rank of life you hold, the evil or the blessing\r\nwill reach you all. The far and the near, the home counties and the\r\nback, the rich and the poor, will suffer or rejoice alike. The heart\r\nthat feels not now is dead; the blood of his children will curse his\r\ncowardice, who shrinks back at a time when a little might have saved the\r\nwhole, and made them happy. I love the man that can smile in trouble,\r\nthat can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection.\r\n'Tis the business of little minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm,\r\nand whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles\r\nunto death. My own line of reasoning is to myself as straight and clear\r\nas a ray of light. Not all the treasures of the world, so far as I\r\nbelieve, could have induced me to support an offensive war, for I think\r\nit murder; but if a thief breaks into my house, burns and destroys my\r\nproperty, and kills or threatens to kill me, or those that are in it,\r\nand to \"bind me in all cases whatsoever\" to his absolute will, am I to\r\nsuffer it? What signifies it to me, whether he who does it is a king or\r\na common man; my countryman or not my countryman; whether it be done by\r\nan individual villain, or an army of them? If we reason to the root\r\nof things we shall find no difference; neither can any just cause be\r\nassigned why we should punish in the one case and pardon in the other.\r\nLet them call me rebel and welcome, I feel no concern from it; but I\r\nshould suffer the misery of devils, were I to make a whore of my soul by\r\nswearing allegiance to one whose character is that of a sottish, stupid,\r\nstubborn, worthless, brutish man. I conceive likewise a horrid idea in\r\nreceiving mercy from a being, who at the last day shall be shrieking to\r\nthe rocks and mountains to cover him, and fleeing with terror from the\r\norphan, the widow, and the slain of America.\r\n\r\nThere are cases which cannot be overdone by language, and this is one.\r\nThere are persons, too, who see not the full extent of the evil which\r\nthreatens them; they solace themselves with hopes that the enemy, if he\r\nsucceed, will be merciful. It is the madness of folly, to expect\r\nmercy from those who have refused to do justice; and even mercy, where\r\nconquest is the object, is only a trick of war; the cunning of the\r\nfox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf, and we ought to guard\r\nequally against both. Howe's first object is, partly by threats and\r\npartly by promises, to terrify or seduce the people to deliver up their\r\narms and receive mercy. The ministry recommended the same plan to Gage,\r\nand this is what the tories call making their peace, \"a peace which\r\npasseth all understanding\" indeed! A peace which would be the immediate\r\nforerunner of a worse ruin than any we have yet thought of. Ye men of\r\nPennsylvania, do reason upon these things! Were the back counties to\r\ngive up their arms, they would fall an easy prey to the Indians, who are\r\nall armed: this perhaps is what some Tories would not be sorry for. Were\r\nthe home counties to deliver up their arms, they would be exposed to the\r\nresentment of the back counties who would then have it in their power to\r\nchastise their defection at pleasure. And were any one state to give up\r\nits arms, that state must be garrisoned by all Howe's army of Britons\r\nand Hessians to preserve it from the anger of the rest. Mutual fear is\r\nthe principal link in the chain of mutual love, and woe be to that state\r\nthat breaks the compact. Howe is mercifully inviting you to barbarous\r\ndestruction, and men must be either rogues or fools that will not see\r\nit. I dwell not upon the vapors of imagination; I bring reason to your\r\nears, and, in language as plain as A, B, C, hold up truth to your eyes.\r\n\r\nI thank God, that I fear not. I see no real cause for fear. I know\r\nour situation well, and can see the way out of it. While our army was\r\ncollected, Howe dared not risk a battle; and it is no credit to him\r\nthat he decamped from the White Plains, and waited a mean opportunity to\r\nravage the defenceless Jerseys; but it is great credit to us, that, with\r\na handful of men, we sustained an orderly retreat for near an hundred\r\nmiles, brought off our ammunition, all our field pieces, the greatest\r\npart of our stores, and had four rivers to pass. None can say that our\r\nretreat was precipitate, for we were near three weeks in performing it,\r\nthat the country might have time to come in. Twice we marched back to\r\nmeet the enemy, and remained out till dark. The sign of fear was not\r\nseen in our camp, and had not some of the cowardly and disaffected\r\ninhabitants spread false alarms through the country, the Jerseys had\r\nnever been ravaged. Once more we are again collected and collecting; our\r\nnew army at both ends of the continent is recruiting fast, and we shall\r\nbe able to open the next campaign with sixty thousand men, well armed\r\nand clothed. This is our situation, and who will may know it. By\r\nperseverance and fortitude we have the prospect of a glorious issue;\r\nby cowardice and submission, the sad choice of a variety of evils--a\r\nravaged country--a depopulated city--habitations without safety, and\r\nslavery without hope--our homes turned into barracks and bawdy-houses\r\nfor Hessians, and a future race to provide for, whose fathers we shall\r\ndoubt of. Look on this picture and weep over it! and if there yet\r\nremains one thoughtless wretch who believes it not, let him suffer it\r\nunlamented.\r\n\r\nCOMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nDecember 23, 1776.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS II. TO LORD HOWE.\r\n\r\n            \"What's in the name of lord, that I should fear\r\n              To bring my grievance to the public ear?\"\r\n                                              CHURCHILL.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSAL empire is the prerogative of a writer. His concerns are with\r\nall mankind, and though he cannot command their obedience, he can assign\r\nthem their duty. The Republic of Letters is more ancient than monarchy,\r\nand of far higher character in the world than the vassal court of\r\nBritain; he that rebels against reason is a real rebel, but he that in\r\ndefence of reason rebels against tyranny has a better title to \"Defender\r\nof the Faith,\" than George the Third.\r\n\r\nAs a military man your lordship may hold out the sword of war, and call\r\nit the \"ultima ratio regum\": the last reason of kings; we in return\r\ncan show you the sword of justice, and call it \"the best scourge of\r\ntyrants.\" The first of these two may threaten, or even frighten for a\r\nwhile, and cast a sickly languor over an insulted people, but reason\r\nwill soon recover the debauch, and restore them again to tranquil\r\nfortitude. Your lordship, I find, has now commenced author, and\r\npublished a proclamation; I have published a Crisis. As they stand, they\r\nare the antipodes of each other; both cannot rise at once, and one of\r\nthem must descend; and so quick is the revolution of things, that your\r\nlordship's performance, I see, has already fallen many degrees from\r\nits first place, and is now just visible on the edge of the political\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to what a pitch of infatuation, blind folly and\r\nobstinacy will carry mankind, and your lordship's drowsy proclamation\r\nis a proof that it does not even quit them in their sleep. Perhaps you\r\nthought America too was taking a nap, and therefore chose, like Satan\r\nto Eve, to whisper the delusion softly, lest you should awaken her. This\r\ncontinent, sir, is too extensive to sleep all at once, and too watchful,\r\neven in its slumbers, not to startle at the unhallowed foot of an\r\ninvader. You may issue your proclamations, and welcome, for we have\r\nlearned to \"reverence ourselves,\" and scorn the insulting ruffian that\r\nemploys you. America, for your deceased brother's sake, would gladly\r\nhave shown you respect and it is a new aggravation to her feelings,\r\nthat Howe should be forgetful, and raise his sword against those, who at\r\ntheir own charge raised a monument to his brother. But your master has\r\ncommanded, and you have not enough of nature left to refuse. Surely\r\nthere must be something strangely degenerating in the love of monarchy,\r\nthat can so completely wear a man down to an ingrate, and make him proud\r\nto lick the dust that kings have trod upon. A few more years, should you\r\nsurvive them, will bestow on you the title of \"an old man\": and in some\r\nhour of future reflection you may probably find the fitness of Wolsey's\r\ndespairing penitence--\"had I served my God as faithful as I have served\r\nmy king, he would not thus have forsaken me in my old age.\"\r\n\r\nThe character you appear to us in, is truly ridiculous. Your friends,\r\nthe Tories, announced your coming, with high descriptions of your\r\nunlimited powers; but your proclamation has given them the lie, by\r\nshowing you to be a commissioner without authority. Had your powers been\r\never so great they were nothing to us, further than we pleased; because\r\nwe had the same right which other nations had, to do what we thought\r\nwas best. \"The UNITED STATES of AMERICA,\" will sound as pompously in the\r\nworld or in history, as \"the kingdom of Great Britain\"; the character of\r\nGeneral Washington will fill a page with as much lustre as that of\r\nLord Howe: and the Congress have as much right to command the king and\r\nParliament in London to desist from legislation, as they or you have\r\nto command the Congress. Only suppose how laughable such an edict would\r\nappear from us, and then, in that merry mood, do but turn the tables\r\nupon yourself, and you will see how your proclamation is received here.\r\nHaving thus placed you in a proper position in which you may have a full\r\nview of your folly, and learn to despise it, I hold up to you, for\r\nthat purpose, the following quotation from your own lunarian\r\nproclamation.--\"And we (Lord Howe and General Howe) do command (and in\r\nhis majesty's name forsooth) all such persons as are assembled together,\r\nunder the name of general or provincial congresses, committees,\r\nconventions or other associations, by whatever name or names known and\r\ndistinguished, to desist and cease from all such treasonable actings and\r\ndoings.\"\r\n\r\nYou introduce your proclamation by referring to your declarations of\r\nthe 14th of July and 19th of September. In the last of these you sunk\r\nyourself below the character of a private gentleman. That I may not\r\nseem to accuse you unjustly, I shall state the circumstance: by a verbal\r\ninvitation of yours, communicated to Congress by General Sullivan, then\r\na prisoner on his parole, you signified your desire of conferring with\r\nsome members of that body as private gentlemen. It was beneath the\r\ndignity of the American Congress to pay any regard to a message that\r\nat best was but a genteel affront, and had too much of the ministerial\r\ncomplexion of tampering with private persons; and which might probably\r\nhave been the case, had the gentlemen who were deputed on the business\r\npossessed that kind of easy virtue which an English courtier is so truly\r\ndistinguished by. Your request, however, was complied with, for honest\r\nmen are naturally more tender of their civil than their political fame.\r\nThe interview ended as every sensible man thought it would; for\r\nyour lordship knows, as well as the writer of the Crisis, that it is\r\nimpossible for the King of England to promise the repeal, or even the\r\nrevisal of any acts of parliament; wherefore, on your part, you had\r\nnothing to say, more than to request, in the room of demanding, the\r\nentire surrender of the continent; and then, if that was complied with,\r\nto promise that the inhabitants should escape with their lives. This was\r\nthe upshot of the conference. You informed the conferees that you were\r\ntwo months in soliciting these powers. We ask, what powers? for as\r\ncommissioner you have none. If you mean the power of pardoning, it is\r\nan oblique proof that your master was determined to sacrifice all before\r\nhim; and that you were two months in dissuading him from his purpose.\r\nAnother evidence of his savage obstinacy! From your own account of the\r\nmatter we may justly draw these two conclusions: 1st, That you serve\r\na monster; and 2d, That never was a messenger sent on a more foolish\r\nerrand than yourself. This plain language may perhaps sound uncouthly to\r\nan ear vitiated by courtly refinements, but words were made for use,\r\nand the fault lies in deserving them, or the abuse in applying them\r\nunfairly.\r\n\r\nSoon after your return to New York, you published a very illiberal and\r\nunmanly handbill against the Congress; for it was certainly stepping out\r\nof the line of common civility, first to screen your national pride\r\nby soliciting an interview with them as private gentlemen, and in the\r\nconclusion to endeavor to deceive the multitude by making a handbill\r\nattack on the whole body of the Congress; you got them together under\r\none name, and abused them under another. But the king you serve, and the\r\ncause you support, afford you so few instances of acting the gentleman,\r\nthat out of pity to your situation the Congress pardoned the insult by\r\ntaking no notice of it.\r\n\r\nYou say in that handbill, \"that they, the Congress, disavowed every\r\npurpose for reconciliation not consonant with their extravagant and\r\ninadmissible claim of independence.\" Why, God bless me! what have you to\r\ndo with our independence? We ask no leave of yours to set it up; we ask\r\nno money of yours to support it; we can do better without your fleets\r\nand armies than with them; you may soon have enough to do to protect\r\nyourselves without being burdened with us. We are very willing to be at\r\npeace with you, to buy of you and sell to you, and, like young beginners\r\nin the world, to work for our living; therefore, why do you put\r\nyourselves out of cash, when we know you cannot spare it, and we do not\r\ndesire you to run into debt? I am willing, sir, that you should see\r\nyour folly in every point of view I can place it in, and for that reason\r\ndescend sometimes to tell you in jest what I wish you to see in earnest.\r\nBut to be more serious with you, why do you say, \"their independence?\"\r\nTo set you right, sir, we tell you, that the independency is ours, not\r\ntheirs. The Congress were authorized by every state on the continent to\r\npublish it to all the world, and in so doing are not to be considered as\r\nthe inventors, but only as the heralds that proclaimed it, or the office\r\nfrom which the sense of the people received a legal form; and it was as\r\nmuch as any or all their heads were worth, to have treated with you on\r\nthe subject of submission under any name whatever. But we know the men\r\nin whom we have trusted; can England say the same of her Parliament?\r\n\r\nI come now more particularly to your proclamation of the 30th of\r\nNovember last. Had you gained an entire conquest over all the armies\r\nof America, and then put forth a proclamation, offering (what you call)\r\nmercy, your conduct would have had some specious show of humanity; but\r\nto creep by surprise into a province, and there endeavor to terrify\r\nand seduce the inhabitants from their just allegiance to the rest by\r\npromises, which you neither meant nor were able to fulfil, is both cruel\r\nand unmanly: cruel in its effects; because, unless you can keep all\r\nthe ground you have marched over, how are you, in the words of your\r\nproclamation, to secure to your proselytes \"the enjoyment of their\r\nproperty?\" What is to become either of your new adopted subjects, or\r\nyour old friends, the Tories, in Burlington, Bordentown, Trenton, Mount\r\nHolly, and many other places, where you proudly lorded it for a few\r\ndays, and then fled with the precipitation of a pursued thief? What, I\r\nsay, is to become of those wretches? What is to become of those who went\r\nover to you from this city and State? What more can you say to them than\r\n\"shift for yourselves?\" Or what more can they hope for than to wander\r\nlike vagabonds over the face of the earth? You may now tell them to take\r\ntheir leave of America, and all that once was theirs. Recommend them,\r\nfor consolation, to your master's court; there perhaps they may make\r\na shift to live on the scraps of some dangling parasite, and choose\r\ncompanions among thousands like themselves. A traitor is the foulest\r\nfiend on earth.\r\n\r\nIn a political sense we ought to thank you for thus bequeathing estates\r\nto the continent; we shall soon, at this rate, be able to carry on a war\r\nwithout expense, and grow rich by the ill policy of Lord Howe, and the\r\ngenerous defection of the Tories. Had you set your foot into this city,\r\nyou would have bestowed estates upon us which we never thought of, by\r\nbringing forth traitors we were unwilling to suspect. But these men,\r\nyou'll say, \"are his majesty's most faithful subjects;\" let that honor,\r\nthen, be all their fortune, and let his majesty take them to himself.\r\n\r\nI am now thoroughly disgusted with them; they live in ungrateful ease,\r\nand bend their whole minds to mischief. It seems as if God had\r\ngiven them over to a spirit of infidelity, and that they are open to\r\nconviction in no other line but that of punishment. It is time to have\r\ndone with tarring, feathering, carting, and taking securities for their\r\nfuture good behavior; every sensible man must feel a conscious shame\r\nat seeing a poor fellow hawked for a show about the streets, when it is\r\nknown he is only the tool of some principal villain, biassed into his\r\noffence by the force of false reasoning, or bribed thereto, through sad\r\nnecessity. We dishonor ourselves by attacking such trifling characters\r\nwhile greater ones are suffered to escape; 'tis our duty to find\r\nthem out, and their proper punishment would be to exile them from the\r\ncontinent for ever. The circle of them is not so great as some imagine;\r\nthe influence of a few have tainted many who are not naturally corrupt.\r\nA continual circulation of lies among those who are not much in the way\r\nof hearing them contradicted, will in time pass for truth; and the crime\r\nlies not in the believer but the inventor. I am not for declaring\r\nwar with every man that appears not so warm as myself: difference of\r\nconstitution, temper, habit of speaking, and many other things, will go\r\na great way in fixing the outward character of a man, yet simple honesty\r\nmay remain at bottom. Some men have naturally a military turn, and can\r\nbrave hardships and the risk of life with a cheerful face; others have\r\nnot; no slavery appears to them so great as the fatigue of arms, and\r\nno terror so powerful as that of personal danger. What can we say? We\r\ncannot alter nature, neither ought we to punish the son because the\r\nfather begot him in a cowardly mood. However, I believe most men have\r\nmore courage than they know of, and that a little at first is enough\r\nto begin with. I knew the time when I thought that the whistling of a\r\ncannon ball would have frightened me almost to death; but I have since\r\ntried it, and find that I can stand it with as little discomposure, and,\r\nI believe, with a much easier conscience than your lordship. The same\r\ndread would return to me again were I in your situation, for my solemn\r\nbelief of your cause is, that it is hellish and damnable, and, under\r\nthat conviction, every thinking man's heart must fail him.\r\n\r\nFrom a concern that a good cause should be dishonored by the least\r\ndisunion among us, I said in my former paper, No. I. \"That should the\r\nenemy now be expelled, I wish, with all the sincerity of a Christian,\r\nthat the names of Whig and Tory might never more be mentioned;\" but\r\nthere is a knot of men among us of such a venomous cast, that they\r\nwill not admit even one's good wishes to act in their favor. Instead\r\nof rejoicing that heaven had, as it were, providentially preserved this\r\ncity from plunder and destruction, by delivering so great a part of the\r\nenemy into our hands with so little effusion of blood, they stubbornly\r\naffected to disbelieve it till within an hour, nay, half an hour, of\r\nthe prisoners arriving; and the Quakers put forth a testimony, dated the\r\n20th of December, signed \"John Pemberton,\" declaring their attachment to\r\nthe British government.* These men are continually harping on the great\r\nsin of our bearing arms, but the king of Britain may lay waste the world\r\nin blood and famine, and they, poor fallen souls, have nothing to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole societies\r\nof men, but as the paper referred to is put forth by an unknown set of\r\nmen, who claim to themselves the right of representing the whole:\r\nand while the whole Society of Quakers admit its validity by a silent\r\nacknowledgment, it is impossible that any distinction can be made by\r\nthe public: and the more so, because the New York paper of the 30th of\r\nDecember, printed by permission of our enemies, says that \"the Quakers\r\nbegin to speak openly of their attachment to the British Constitution.\"\r\nWe are certain that we have many friends among them, and wish to know\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn some future paper I intend to distinguish between the different kind\r\nof persons who have been denominated Tories; for this I am clear in,\r\nthat all are not so who have been called so, nor all men Whigs who\r\nwere once thought so; and as I mean not to conceal the name of any true\r\nfriend when there shall be occasion to mention him, neither will I that\r\nof an enemy, who ought to be known, let his rank, station or religion be\r\nwhat it may. Much pains have been taken by some to set your lordship's\r\nprivate character in an amiable light, but as it has chiefly been done\r\nby men who know nothing about you, and who are no ways remarkable for\r\ntheir attachment to us, we have no just authority for believing it.\r\nGeorge the Third has imposed upon us by the same arts, but time, at\r\nlength, has done him justice, and the same fate may probably attend your\r\nlordship. You avowed purpose here is to kill, conquer, plunder, pardon,\r\nand enslave: and the ravages of your army through the Jerseys have been\r\nmarked with as much barbarism as if you had openly professed yourself\r\nthe prince of ruffians; not even the appearance of humanity has been\r\npreserved either on the march or the retreat of your troops; no general\r\norder that I could ever learn, has ever been issued to prevent or\r\neven forbid your troops from robbery, wherever they came, and the only\r\ninstance of justice, if it can be called such, which has distinguished\r\nyou for impartiality, is, that you treated and plundered all alike; what\r\ncould not be carried away has been destroyed, and mahogany furniture has\r\nbeen deliberately laid on fire for fuel, rather than the men should be\r\nfatigued with cutting wood.* There was a time when the Whigs confided\r\nmuch in your supposed candor, and the Tories rested themselves in your\r\nfavor; the experiments have now been made, and failed; in every town,\r\nnay, every cottage, in the Jerseys, where your arms have been, is\r\na testimony against you. How you may rest under this sacrifice of\r\ncharacter I know not; but this I know, that you sleep and rise with the\r\ndaily curses of thousands upon you; perhaps the misery which the Tories\r\nhave suffered by your proffered mercy may give them some claim to their\r\ncountry's pity, and be in the end the best favor you could show them.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * As some people may doubt the truth of such wanton destruction, I\r\nthink it necessary to inform them that one of the people called Quakers,\r\nwho lives at Trenton, gave me this information at the house of Mr.\r\nMichael Hutchinson, (one of the same profession,) who lives near Trenton\r\nferry on the Pennsylvania side, Mr. Hutchinson being present.\r\n\r\nIn a folio general-order book belonging to Col. Rhal's battalion, taken\r\nat Trenton, and now in the possession of the council of safety for\r\nthis state, the following barbarous order is frequently repeated, \"His\r\nexcellency the Commander-in-Chief orders, that all inhabitants who\r\nshall be found with arms, not having an officer with them, shall be\r\nimmediately taken and hung up.\" How many you may thus have privately\r\nsacrificed, we know not, and the account can only be settled in another\r\nworld. Your treatment of prisoners, in order to distress them to enlist\r\nin your infernal service, is not to be equalled by any instance in\r\nEurope. Yet this is the humane Lord Howe and his brother, whom the\r\nTories and their three-quarter kindred, the Quakers, or some of them at\r\nleast, have been holding up for patterns of justice and mercy!\r\n\r\nA bad cause will ever be supported by bad means and bad men; and whoever\r\nwill be at the pains of examining strictly into things, will find that\r\none and the same spirit of oppression and impiety, more or less,\r\ngoverns through your whole party in both countries: not many days ago,\r\nI accidentally fell in company with a person of this city noted for\r\nespousing your cause, and on my remarking to him, \"that it appeared\r\nclear to me, by the late providential turn of affairs, that God Almighty\r\nwas visibly on our side,\" he replied, \"We care nothing for that you may\r\nhave Him, and welcome; if we have but enough of the devil on our side,\r\nwe shall do.\" However carelessly this might be spoken, matters not, 'tis\r\nstill the insensible principle that directs all your conduct and will at\r\nlast most assuredly deceive and ruin you.\r\n\r\nIf ever a nation was made and foolish, blind to its own interest and\r\nbent on its own destruction, it is Britain. There are such things as\r\nnational sins, and though the punishment of individuals may be reserved\r\nto another world, national punishment can only be inflicted in this\r\nworld. Britain, as a nation, is, in my inmost belief, the greatest and\r\nmost ungrateful offender against God on the face of the whole earth.\r\nBlessed with all the commerce she could wish for, and furnished, by\r\na vast extension of dominion, with the means of civilizing both the\r\neastern and western world, she has made no other use of both than\r\nproudly to idolize her own \"thunder,\" and rip up the bowels of whole\r\ncountries for what she could get. Like Alexander, she has made war her\r\nsport, and inflicted misery for prodigality's sake. The blood of India\r\nis not yet repaid, nor the wretchedness of Africa yet requited. Of\r\nlate she has enlarged her list of national cruelties by her butcherly\r\ndestruction of the Caribbs of St. Vincent's, and returning an answer by\r\nthe sword to the meek prayer for \"Peace, liberty and safety.\" These\r\nare serious things, and whatever a foolish tyrant, a debauched court,\r\na trafficking legislature, or a blinded people may think, the national\r\naccount with heaven must some day or other be settled: all countries\r\nhave sooner or later been called to their reckoning; the proudest\r\nempires have sunk when the balance was struck; and Britain, like an\r\nindividual penitent, must undergo her day of sorrow, and the sooner it\r\nhappens to her the better. As I wish it over, I wish it to come, but\r\nwithal wish that it may be as light as possible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your lordship has no taste for serious things; by your\r\nconnections in England I should suppose not; therefore I shall drop this\r\npart of the subject, and take it up in a line in which you will better\r\nunderstand me.\r\n\r\nBy what means, may I ask, do you expect to conquer America? If you could\r\nnot effect it in the summer, when our army was less than yours, nor\r\nin the winter, when we had none, how are you to do it? In point of\r\ngeneralship you have been outwitted, and in point of fortitude outdone;\r\nyour advantages turn out to your loss, and show us that it is in our\r\npower to ruin you by gifts: like a game of drafts, we can move out of\r\none square to let you come in, in order that we may afterwards take\r\ntwo or three for one; and as we can always keep a double corner for\r\nourselves, we can always prevent a total defeat. You cannot be so\r\ninsensible as not to see that we have two to one the advantage of you,\r\nbecause we conquer by a drawn game, and you lose by it. Burgoyne might\r\nhave taught your lordship this knowledge; he has been long a student in\r\nthe doctrine of chances.\r\n\r\nI have no other idea of conquering countries than by subduing the armies\r\nwhich defend them: have you done this, or can you do it? If you have\r\nnot, it would be civil in you to let your proclamations alone for the\r\npresent; otherwise, you will ruin more Tories by your grace and favor,\r\nthan you will Whigs by your arms.\r\n\r\nWere you to obtain possession of this city, you would not know what to\r\ndo with it more than to plunder it. To hold it in the manner you hold\r\nNew York, would be an additional dead weight upon your hands; and if a\r\ngeneral conquest is your object, you had better be without the city than\r\nwith it. When you have defeated all our armies, the cities will fall\r\ninto your hands of themselves; but to creep into them in the manner you\r\ngot into Princeton, Trenton, &c. is like robbing an orchard in the\r\nnight before the fruit be ripe, and running away in the morning. Your\r\nexperiment in the Jerseys is sufficient to teach you that you have\r\nsomething more to do than barely to get into other people's houses; and\r\nyour new converts, to whom you promised all manner of protection, and\r\nseduced into new guilt by pardoning them from their former virtues, must\r\nbegin to have a very contemptible opinion both of your power and your\r\npolicy. Your authority in the Jerseys is now reduced to the small circle\r\nwhich your army occupies, and your proclamation is no where else seen\r\nunless it be to be laughed at. The mighty subduers of the continent have\r\nretreated into a nutshell, and the proud forgivers of our sins are fled\r\nfrom those they came to pardon; and all this at a time when they were\r\ndespatching vessel after vessel to England with the great news of\r\nevery day. In short, you have managed your Jersey expedition so very\r\ndexterously, that the dead only are conquerors, because none will\r\ndispute the ground with them.\r\n\r\nIn all the wars which you have formerly been concerned in you had only\r\narmies to contend with; in this case you have both an army and a country\r\nto combat with. In former wars, the countries followed the fate of their\r\ncapitals; Canada fell with Quebec, and Minorca with Port Mahon or St.\r\nPhillips; by subduing those, the conquerors opened a way into, and\r\nbecame masters of the country: here it is otherwise; if you get\r\npossession of a city here, you are obliged to shut yourselves up in it,\r\nand can make no other use of it, than to spend your country's money in.\r\nThis is all the advantage you have drawn from New York; and you would\r\ndraw less from Philadelphia, because it requires more force to keep it,\r\nand is much further from the sea. A pretty figure you and the Tories\r\nwould cut in this city, with a river full of ice, and a town full of\r\nfire; for the immediate consequence of your getting here would be, that\r\nyou would be cannonaded out again, and the Tories be obliged to make\r\ngood the damage; and this sooner or later will be the fate of New York.\r\n\r\nI wish to see the city saved, not so much from military as from natural\r\nmotives. 'Tis the hiding place of women and children, and Lord Howe's\r\nproper business is with our armies. When I put all the circumstances\r\ntogether which ought to be taken, I laugh at your notion of conquering\r\nAmerica. Because you lived in a little country, where an army might run\r\nover the whole in a few days, and where a single company of soldiers\r\nmight put a multitude to the rout, you expected to find it the same\r\nhere. It is plain that you brought over with you all the narrow notions\r\nyou were bred up with, and imagined that a proclamation in the king's\r\nname was to do great things; but Englishmen always travel for knowledge,\r\nand your lordship, I hope, will return, if you return at all, much wiser\r\nthan you came.\r\n\r\nWe may be surprised by events we did not expect, and in that interval of\r\nrecollection you may gain some temporary advantage: such was the case\r\na few weeks ago, but we soon ripen again into reason, collect our\r\nstrength, and while you are preparing for a triumph, we come upon you\r\nwith a defeat. Such it has been, and such it would be were you to try\r\nit a hundred times over. Were you to garrison the places you might march\r\nover, in order to secure their subjection, (for remember you can do it\r\nby no other means,) your army would be like a stream of water running to\r\nnothing. By the time you extended from New York to Virginia, you would\r\nbe reduced to a string of drops not capable of hanging together; while\r\nwe, by retreating from State to State, like a river turning back upon\r\nitself, would acquire strength in the same proportion as you lost it,\r\nand in the end be capable of overwhelming you. The country, in the\r\nmeantime, would suffer, but it is a day of suffering, and we ought\r\nto expect it. What we contend for is worthy the affliction we may go\r\nthrough. If we get but bread to eat, and any kind of raiment to put on,\r\nwe ought not only to be contented, but thankful. More than that we ought\r\nnot to look for, and less than that heaven has not yet suffered us\r\nto want. He that would sell his birthright for a little salt, is as\r\nworthless as he who sold it for pottage without salt; and he that would\r\npart with it for a gay coat, or a plain coat, ought for ever to be\r\na slave in buff. What are salt, sugar and finery, to the inestimable\r\nblessings of \"Liberty and Safety!\" Or what are the inconveniences of\r\na few months to the tributary bondage of ages? The meanest peasant in\r\nAmerica, blessed with these sentiments, is a happy man compared with a\r\nNew York Tory; he can eat his morsel without repining, and when he has\r\ndone, can sweeten it with a repast of wholesome air; he can take his\r\nchild by the hand and bless it, without feeling the conscious shame of\r\nneglecting a parent's duty.\r\n\r\nIn publishing these remarks I have several objects in view.\r\n\r\nOn your part they are to expose the folly of your pretended authority\r\nas a commissioner; the wickedness of your cause in general; and the\r\nimpossibility of your conquering us at any rate. On the part of the\r\npublic, my intention is, to show them their true and sold interest;\r\nto encourage them to their own good, to remove the fears and falsities\r\nwhich bad men have spread, and weak men have encouraged; and to excite\r\nin all men a love for union, and a cheerfulness for duty.\r\n\r\nI shall submit one more case to you respecting your conquest of this\r\ncountry, and then proceed to new observations.\r\n\r\nSuppose our armies in every part of this continent were immediately to\r\ndisperse, every man to his home, or where else he might be safe, and\r\nengage to reassemble again on a certain future day; it is clear that you\r\nwould then have no army to contend with, yet you would be as much at\r\na loss in that case as you are now; you would be afraid to send your\r\ntroops in parties over to the continent, either to disarm or prevent us\r\nfrom assembling, lest they should not return; and while you kept them\r\ntogether, having no arms of ours to dispute with, you could not call it\r\na conquest; you might furnish out a pompous page in the London Gazette\r\nor a New York paper, but when we returned at the appointed time, you\r\nwould have the same work to do that you had at first.\r\n\r\nIt has been the folly of Britain to suppose herself more powerful than\r\nshe really is, and by that means has arrogated to herself a rank in the\r\nworld she is not entitled to: for more than this century past she\r\nhas not been able to carry on a war without foreign assistance. In\r\nMarlborough's campaigns, and from that day to this, the number of German\r\ntroops and officers assisting her have been about equal with her own;\r\nten thousand Hessians were sent to England last war to protect her\r\nfrom a French invasion; and she would have cut but a poor figure in her\r\nCanadian and West Indian expeditions, had not America been lavish both\r\nof her money and men to help her along. The only instance in which she\r\nwas engaged singly, that I can recollect, was against the rebellion in\r\nScotland, in the years 1745 and 1746, and in that, out of three battles,\r\nshe was twice beaten, till by thus reducing their numbers, (as we\r\nshall yours) and taking a supply ship that was coming to Scotland\r\nwith clothes, arms and money, (as we have often done,) she was at last\r\nenabled to defeat them. England was never famous by land; her officers\r\nhave generally been suspected of cowardice, have more of the air of a\r\ndancing-master than a soldier, and by the samples which we have taken\r\nprisoners, we give the preference to ourselves. Her strength, of late,\r\nhas lain in her extravagance; but as her finances and credit are now\r\nlow, her sinews in that line begin to fail fast. As a nation she is the\r\npoorest in Europe; for were the whole kingdom, and all that is in it, to\r\nbe put up for sale like the estate of a bankrupt, it would not fetch as\r\nmuch as she owes; yet this thoughtless wretch must go to war, and with\r\nthe avowed design, too, of making us beasts of burden, to support her in\r\nriot and debauchery, and to assist her afterwards in distressing those\r\nnations who are now our best friends. This ingratitude may suit a Tory,\r\nor the unchristian peevishness of a fallen Quaker, but none else.\r\n\r\n'Tis the unhappy temper of the English to be pleased with any war, right\r\nor wrong, be it but successful; but they soon grow discontented with ill\r\nfortune, and it is an even chance that they are as clamorous for peace\r\nnext summer, as the king and his ministers were for war last winter.\r\nIn this natural view of things, your lordship stands in a very critical\r\nsituation: your whole character is now staked upon your laurels; if they\r\nwither, you wither with them; if they flourish, you cannot live long to\r\nlook at them; and at any rate, the black account hereafter is not far\r\noff. What lately appeared to us misfortunes, were only blessings in\r\ndisguise; and the seeming advantages on your side have turned out to\r\nour profit. Even our loss of this city, as far as we can see, might be a\r\nprincipal gain to us: the more surface you spread over, the thinner\r\nyou will be, and the easier wiped away; and our consolation under that\r\napparent disaster would be, that the estates of the Tories would become\r\nsecurities for the repairs. In short, there is no old ground we can fail\r\nupon, but some new foundation rises again to support us. \"We have put,\r\nsir, our hands to the plough, and cursed be he that looketh back.\"\r\n\r\nYour king, in his speech to parliament last spring, declared, \"That\r\nhe had no doubt but the great force they had enabled him to send to\r\nAmerica, would effectually reduce the rebellious colonies.\" It has not,\r\nneither can it; but it has done just enough to lay the foundation of\r\nits own next year's ruin. You are sensible that you left England in a\r\ndivided, distracted state of politics, and, by the command you had here,\r\nyou became a principal prop in the court party; their fortunes rest on\r\nyours; by a single express you can fix their value with the public, and\r\nthe degree to which their spirits shall rise or fall; they are in your\r\nhands as stock, and you have the secret of the alley with you. Thus\r\nsituated and connected, you become the unintentional mechanical\r\ninstrument of your own and their overthrow. The king and his ministers\r\nput conquest out of doubt, and the credit of both depended on the proof.\r\nTo support them in the interim, it was necessary that you should make\r\nthe most of every thing, and we can tell by Hugh Gaine's New York\r\npaper what the complexion of the London Gazette is. With such a list\r\nof victories the nation cannot expect you will ask new supplies; and\r\nto confess your want of them would give the lie to your triumphs, and\r\nimpeach the king and his ministers of treasonable deception. If you make\r\nthe necessary demand at home, your party sinks; if you make it not, you\r\nsink yourself; to ask it now is too late, and to ask it before was too\r\nsoon, and unless it arrive quickly will be of no use. In short, the part\r\nyou have to act, cannot be acted; and I am fully persuaded that all you\r\nhave to trust to is, to do the best you can with what force you have\r\ngot, or little more. Though we have greatly exceeded you in point of\r\ngeneralship and bravery of men, yet, as a people, we have not entered\r\ninto the full soul of enterprise; for I, who know England and the\r\ndisposition of the people well, am confident, that it is easier for us\r\nto effect a revolution there, than you a conquest here; a few thousand\r\nmen landed in England with the declared design of deposing the present\r\nking, bringing his ministers to trial, and setting up the Duke of\r\nGloucester in his stead, would assuredly carry their point, while you\r\nare grovelling here, ignorant of the matter. As I send all my papers to\r\nEngland, this, like Common Sense, will find its way there; and though\r\nit may put one party on their guard, it will inform the other, and the\r\nnation in general, of our design to help them.\r\n\r\nThus far, sir, I have endeavored to give you a picture of present\r\naffairs: you may draw from it what conclusions you please. I wish\r\nas well to the true prosperity of England as you can, but I consider\r\nINDEPENDENCE as America's natural right and interest, and never could\r\nsee any real disservice it would be to Britain. If an English merchant\r\nreceives an order, and is paid for it, it signifies nothing to him who\r\ngoverns the country. This is my creed of politics. If I have any where\r\nexpressed myself over-warmly, 'tis from a fixed, immovable hatred I\r\nhave, and ever had, to cruel men and cruel measures. I have likewise an\r\naversion to monarchy, as being too debasing to the dignity of man; but\r\nI never troubled others with my notions till very lately, nor ever\r\npublished a syllable in England in my life. What I write is pure nature,\r\nand my pen and my soul have ever gone together. My writings I have\r\nalways given away, reserving only the expense of printing and paper, and\r\nsometimes not even that. I never courted either fame or interest, and my\r\nmanner of life, to those who know it, will justify what I say. My study\r\nis to be useful, and if your lordship loves mankind as well as I do,\r\nyou would, seeing you cannot conquer us, cast about and lend your hand\r\ntowards accomplishing a peace. Our independence with God's blessing\r\nwe will maintain against all the world; but as we wish to avoid\r\nevil ourselves, we wish not to inflict it on others. I am never\r\nover-inquisitive into the secrets of the cabinet, but I have some notion\r\nthat, if you neglect the present opportunity, it will not be in our\r\npower to make a separate peace with you afterwards; for whatever\r\ntreaties or alliances we form, we shall most faithfully abide by;\r\nwherefore you may be deceived if you think you can make it with us at\r\nany time. A lasting independent peace is my wish, end and aim; and to\r\naccomplish that, I pray God the Americans may never be defeated, and I\r\ntrust while they have good officers, and are well commanded, and willing\r\nto be commanded, that they NEVER WILL BE.\r\n\r\n                                     COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 13, 1777.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS III. (IN THE PROGRESS OF POLITICS)\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE progress of politics, as in the common occurrences of life,\r\nwe are not only apt to forget the ground we have travelled over, but\r\nfrequently neglect to gather up experience as we go. We expend, if I may\r\nso say, the knowledge of every day on the circumstances that produce it,\r\nand journey on in search of new matter and new refinements: but as it is\r\npleasant and sometimes useful to look back, even to the first periods of\r\ninfancy, and trace the turns and windings through which we have passed,\r\nso we may likewise derive many advantages by halting a while in our\r\npolitical career, and taking a review of the wondrous complicated\r\nlabyrinth of little more than yesterday.\r\n\r\nTruly may we say, that never did men grow old in so short a time! We\r\nhave crowded the business of an age into the compass of a few months,\r\nand have been driven through such a rapid succession of things, that\r\nfor the want of leisure to think, we unavoidably wasted knowledge as we\r\ncame, and have left nearly as much behind us as we brought with us: but\r\nthe road is yet rich with the fragments, and, before we finally lose\r\nsight of them, will repay us for the trouble of stopping to pick them\r\nup.\r\n\r\nWere a man to be totally deprived of memory, he would be incapable of\r\nforming any just opinion; every thing about him would seem a chaos:\r\nhe would have even his own history to ask from every one; and by not\r\nknowing how the world went in his absence, he would be at a loss to\r\nknow how it ought to go on when he recovered, or rather, returned to it\r\nagain. In like manner, though in a less degree, a too great inattention\r\nto past occurrences retards and bewilders our judgment in everything;\r\nwhile, on the contrary, by comparing what is past with what is present,\r\nwe frequently hit on the true character of both, and become wise with\r\nvery little trouble. It is a kind of counter-march, by which we get into\r\nthe rear of time, and mark the movements and meaning of things as we\r\nmake our return. There are certain circumstances, which, at the time\r\nof their happening, are a kind of riddles, and as every riddle is to be\r\nfollowed by its answer, so those kind of circumstances will be followed\r\nby their events, and those events are always the true solution. A\r\nconsiderable space of time may lapse between, and unless we continue our\r\nobservations from the one to the other, the harmony of them will pass\r\naway unnoticed: but the misfortune is, that partly from the pressing\r\nnecessity of some instant things, and partly from the impatience of our\r\nown tempers, we are frequently in such a hurry to make out the meaning\r\nof everything as fast as it happens, that we thereby never truly\r\nunderstand it; and not only start new difficulties to ourselves by so\r\ndoing, but, as it were, embarrass Providence in her good designs.\r\n\r\nI have been civil in stating this fault on a large scale, for, as it now\r\nstands, it does not appear to be levelled against any particular set of\r\nmen; but were it to be refined a little further, it might afterwards\r\nbe applied to the Tories with a degree of striking propriety: those men\r\nhave been remarkable for drawing sudden conclusions from single facts.\r\nThe least apparent mishap on our side, or the least seeming advantage\r\non the part of the enemy, have determined with them the fate of a whole\r\ncampaign. By this hasty judgment they have converted a retreat into\r\na defeat; mistook generalship for error; while every little advantage\r\npurposely given the enemy, either to weaken their strength by dividing\r\nit, embarrass their councils by multiplying their objects, or to secure\r\na greater post by the surrender of a less, has been instantly magnified\r\ninto a conquest. Thus, by quartering ill policy upon ill principles,\r\nthey have frequently promoted the cause they designed to injure, and\r\ninjured that which they intended to promote.\r\n\r\nIt is probable the campaign may open before this number comes from\r\nthe press. The enemy have long lain idle, and amused themselves with\r\ncarrying on the war by proclamations only. While they continue their\r\ndelay our strength increases, and were they to move to action now, it\r\nis a circumstantial proof that they have no reinforcement coming;\r\nwherefore, in either case, the comparative advantage will be ours. Like\r\na wounded, disabled whale, they want only time and room to die in; and\r\nthough in the agony of their exit, it may be unsafe to live within the\r\nflapping of their tail, yet every hour shortens their date, and lessens\r\ntheir power of mischief. If any thing happens while this number is in\r\nthe press, it will afford me a subject for the last pages of it. At\r\npresent I am tired of waiting; and as neither the enemy, nor the state\r\nof politics have yet produced any thing new, I am thereby left in\r\nthe field of general matter, undirected by any striking or particular\r\nobject. This Crisis, therefore, will be made up rather of variety than\r\nnovelty, and consist more of things useful than things wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe success of the cause, the union of the people, and the means of\r\nsupporting and securing both, are points which cannot be too much\r\nattended to. He who doubts of the former is a desponding coward, and\r\nhe who wilfully disturbs the latter is a traitor. Their characters are\r\neasily fixed, and under these short descriptions I leave them for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest degrees of sentimental union which America ever\r\nknew, was in denying the right of the British parliament \"to bind the\r\ncolonies in all cases whatsoever.\" The Declaration is, in its form, an\r\nalmighty one, and is the loftiest stretch of arbitrary power that ever\r\none set of men or one country claimed over another. Taxation was\r\nnothing more than the putting the declared right into practice; and\r\nthis failing, recourse was had to arms, as a means to establish both\r\nthe right and the practice, or to answer a worse purpose, which will be\r\nmentioned in the course of this number. And in order to repay themselves\r\nthe expense of an army, and to profit by their own injustice, the\r\ncolonies were, by another law, declared to be in a state of actual\r\nrebellion, and of consequence all property therein would fall to the\r\nconquerors.\r\n\r\nThe colonies, on their part, first, denied the right; secondly, they\r\nsuspended the use of taxable articles, and petitioned against the\r\npractice of taxation: and these failing, they, thirdly, defended their\r\nproperty by force, as soon as it was forcibly invaded, and, in answer\r\nto the declaration of rebellion and non-protection, published their\r\nDeclaration of Independence and right of self-protection.\r\n\r\nThese, in a few words, are the different stages of the quarrel; and the\r\nparts are so intimately and necessarily connected with each other as to\r\nadmit of no separation. A person, to use a trite phrase, must be a\r\nWhig or a Tory in a lump. His feelings, as a man, may be wounded; his\r\ncharity, as a Christian, may be moved; but his political principles must\r\ngo through all the cases on one side or the other. He cannot be a Whig\r\nin this stage, and a Tory in that. If he says he is against the united\r\nindependence of the continent, he is to all intents and purposes against\r\nher in all the rest; because this last comprehends the whole. And he may\r\njust as well say, that Britain was right in declaring us rebels; right\r\nin taxing us; and right in declaring her \"right to bind the colonies in\r\nall cases whatsoever.\" It signifies nothing what neutral ground, of his\r\nown creating, he may skulk upon for shelter, for the quarrel in no\r\nstage of it hath afforded any such ground; and either we or Britain are\r\nabsolutely right or absolutely wrong through the whole.\r\n\r\nBritain, like a gamester nearly ruined, has now put all her losses into\r\none bet, and is playing a desperate game for the total. If she wins\r\nit, she wins from me my life; she wins the continent as the forfeited\r\nproperty of rebels; the right of taxing those that are left as reduced\r\nsubjects; and the power of binding them slaves: and the single die\r\nwhich determines this unparalleled event is, whether we support our\r\nindependence or she overturn it. This is coming to the point at once.\r\nHere is the touchstone to try men by. He that is not a supporter of the\r\nindependent States of America in the same degree that his religious and\r\npolitical principles would suffer him to support the government of any\r\nother country, of which he called himself a subject, is, in the American\r\nsense of the word, A TORY; and the instant that he endeavors to bring\r\nhis toryism into practice, he becomes A TRAITOR. The first can only be\r\ndetected by a general test, and the law hath already provided for the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nIt is unnatural and impolitic to admit men who would root up our\r\nindependence to have any share in our legislation, either as electors\r\nor representatives; because the support of our independence rests, in\r\na great measure, on the vigor and purity of our public bodies. Would\r\nBritain, even in time of peace, much less in war, suffer an election to\r\nbe carried by men who professed themselves to be not her subjects, or\r\nallow such to sit in Parliament? Certainly not.\r\n\r\nBut there are a certain species of Tories with whom conscience or\r\nprinciple has nothing to do, and who are so from avarice only. Some\r\nof the first fortunes on the continent, on the part of the Whigs, are\r\nstaked on the issue of our present measures. And shall disaffection only\r\nbe rewarded with security? Can any thing be a greater inducement to a\r\nmiserly man, than the hope of making his Mammon safe? And though the\r\nscheme be fraught with every character of folly, yet, so long as he\r\nsupposes, that by doing nothing materially criminal against America\r\non one part, and by expressing his private disapprobation against\r\nindependence, as palliative with the enemy, on the other part, he stands\r\nin a safe line between both; while, I say, this ground be suffered to\r\nremain, craft, and the spirit of avarice, will point it out, and men\r\nwill not be wanting to fill up this most contemptible of all characters.\r\n\r\nThese men, ashamed to own the sordid cause from whence their\r\ndisaffection springs, add thereby meanness to meanness, by endeavoring\r\nto shelter themselves under the mask of hypocrisy; that is, they had\r\nrather be thought to be Tories from some kind of principle, than Tories\r\nby having no principle at all. But till such time as they can show\r\nsome real reason, natural, political, or conscientious, on which their\r\nobjections to independence are founded, we are not obliged to give them\r\ncredit for being Tories of the first stamp, but must set them down as\r\nTories of the last.\r\n\r\nIn the second number of the Crisis, I endeavored to show the\r\nimpossibility of the enemy's making any conquest of America, that\r\nnothing was wanting on our part but patience and perseverance, and\r\nthat, with these virtues, our success, as far as human speculation could\r\ndiscern, seemed as certain as fate. But as there are many among us, who,\r\ninfluenced by others, have regularly gone back from the principles\r\nthey once held, in proportion as we have gone forward; and as it is the\r\nunfortunate lot of many a good man to live within the neighborhood of\r\ndisaffected ones; I shall, therefore, for the sake of confirming the one\r\nand recovering the other, endeavor, in the space of a page or two, to go\r\nover some of the leading principles in support of independence. It is a\r\nmuch pleasanter task to prevent vice than to punish it, and, however our\r\ntempers may be gratified by resentment, or our national expenses eased\r\nby forfeited estates, harmony and friendship is, nevertheless, the\r\nhappiest condition a country can be blessed with.\r\n\r\nThe principal arguments in support of independence may be comprehended\r\nunder the four following heads.\r\n\r\n     1st, The natural right of the continent to independence.\r\n     2d, Her interest in being independent.\r\n     3d, The necessity,--and\r\n     4th, The moral advantages arising therefrom.\r\n\r\nI. The natural right of the continent to independence, is a point which\r\nnever yet was called in question. It will not even admit of a debate.\r\nTo deny such a right, would be a kind of atheism against nature: and the\r\nbest answer to such an objection would be, \"The fool hath said in his\r\nheart there is no God.\"\r\n\r\nII. The interest of the continent in being independent is a point as\r\nclearly right as the former. America, by her own internal industry,\r\nand unknown to all the powers of Europe, was, at the beginning of the\r\ndispute, arrived at a pitch of greatness, trade and population, beyond\r\nwhich it was the interest of Britain not to suffer her to pass, lest she\r\nshould grow too powerful to be kept subordinate. She began to view\r\nthis country with the same uneasy malicious eye, with which a covetous\r\nguardian would view his ward, whose estate he had been enriching himself\r\nby for twenty years, and saw him just arriving at manhood. And America\r\nowes no more to Britain for her present maturity, than the ward would\r\nto the guardian for being twenty-one years of age. That America hath\r\nflourished at the time she was under the government of Britain, is\r\ntrue; but there is every natural reason to believe, that had she been an\r\nindependent country from the first settlement thereof, uncontrolled by\r\nany foreign power, free to make her own laws, regulate and encourage her\r\nown commerce, she had by this time been of much greater worth than now.\r\nThe case is simply this: the first settlers in the different colonies\r\nwere left to shift for themselves, unnoticed and unsupported by any\r\nEuropean government; but as the tyranny and persecution of the old world\r\ndaily drove numbers to the new, and as, by the favor of heaven on their\r\nindustry and perseverance, they grew into importance, so, in a like\r\ndegree, they became an object of profit to the greedy eyes of Europe.\r\nIt was impossible, in this state of infancy, however thriving and\r\npromising, that they could resist the power of any armed invader that\r\nshould seek to bring them under his authority. In this situation,\r\nBritain thought it worth her while to claim them, and the continent\r\nreceived and acknowledged the claimer. It was, in reality, of no very\r\ngreat importance who was her master, seeing, that from the force and\r\nambition of the different powers of Europe, she must, till she acquired\r\nstrength enough to assert her own right, acknowledge some one. As well,\r\nperhaps, Britain as another; and it might have been as well to have been\r\nunder the states of Holland as any. The same hopes of engrossing and\r\nprofiting by her trade, by not oppressing it too much, would have\r\noperated alike with any master, and produced to the colonies the same\r\neffects. The clamor of protection, likewise, was all a farce; because,\r\nin order to make that protection necessary, she must first, by her own\r\nquarrels, create us enemies. Hard terms indeed!\r\n\r\nTo know whether it be the interest of the continent to be independent,\r\nwe need only ask this easy, simple question: Is it the interest of a man\r\nto be a boy all his life? The answer to one will be the answer to both.\r\nAmerica hath been one continued scene of legislative contention from\r\nthe first king's representative to the last; and this was unavoidably\r\nfounded in the natural opposition of interest between the old country\r\nand the new. A governor sent from England, or receiving his authority\r\ntherefrom, ought never to have been considered in any other light\r\nthan that of a genteel commissioned spy, whose private business was\r\ninformation, and his public business a kind of civilized oppression. In\r\nthe first of these characters he was to watch the tempers, sentiments,\r\nand disposition of the people, the growth of trade, and the increase of\r\nprivate fortunes; and, in the latter, to suppress all such acts of the\r\nassemblies, however beneficial to the people, which did not directly\r\nor indirectly throw some increase of power or profit into the hands of\r\nthose that sent him.\r\n\r\nAmerica, till now, could never be called a free country, because her\r\nlegislation depended on the will of a man three thousand miles distant,\r\nwhose interest was in opposition to ours, and who, by a single \"no,\"\r\ncould forbid what law he pleased.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of trade, likewise, is, to a trading country, an article of\r\nsuch importance, that the principal source of wealth depends upon it;\r\nand it is impossible that any country can flourish, as it otherwise\r\nmight do, whose commerce is engrossed, cramped and fettered by the\r\nlaws and mandates of another--yet these evils, and more than I can here\r\nenumerate, the continent has suffered by being under the government of\r\nEngland. By an independence we clear the whole at once--put\r\nan end to the business of unanswered petitions and fruitless\r\nremonstrances--exchange Britain for Europe--shake hands with the\r\nworld--live at peace with the world--and trade to any market where we\r\ncan buy and sell.\r\n\r\nIII. The necessity, likewise, of being independent, even before it was\r\ndeclared, became so evident and important, that the continent ran the\r\nrisk of being ruined every day that she delayed it. There was reason to\r\nbelieve that Britain would endeavor to make an European matter of it,\r\nand, rather than lose the whole, would dismember it, like Poland, and\r\ndispose of her several claims to the highest bidder. Genoa, failing in\r\nher attempts to reduce Corsica, made a sale of it to the French, and\r\nsuch trafficks have been common in the old world. We had at that time no\r\nambassador in any part of Europe, to counteract her negotiations, and\r\nby that means she had the range of every foreign court uncontradicted\r\non our part. We even knew nothing of the treaty for the Hessians till it\r\nwas concluded, and the troops ready to embark. Had we been independent\r\nbefore, we had probably prevented her obtaining them. We had no credit\r\nabroad, because of our rebellious dependency. Our ships could claim no\r\nprotection in foreign ports, because we afforded them no justifiable\r\nreason for granting it to us. The calling ourselves subjects, and at\r\nthe same time fighting against the power which we acknowledged, was\r\na dangerous precedent to all Europe. If the grievances justified the\r\ntaking up arms, they justified our separation; if they did not justify\r\nour separation, neither could they justify our taking up arms. All\r\nEurope was interested in reducing us as rebels, and all Europe (or the\r\ngreatest part at least) is interested in supporting us as independent\r\nStates. At home our condition was still worse: our currency had no\r\nfoundation, and the fall of it would have ruined Whig and Tory alike. We\r\nhad no other law than a kind of moderated passion; no other civil\r\npower than an honest mob; and no other protection than the temporary\r\nattachment of one man to another. Had independence been delayed a few\r\nmonths longer, this continent would have been plunged into irrecoverable\r\nconfusion: some violent for it, some against it, till, in the general\r\ncabal, the rich would have been ruined, and the poor destroyed. It is to\r\nindependence that every Tory owes the present safety which he lives\r\nin; for by that, and that only, we emerged from a state of dangerous\r\nsuspense, and became a regular people.\r\n\r\nThe necessity, likewise, of being independent, had there been no rupture\r\nbetween Britain and America, would, in a little time, have brought one\r\non. The increasing importance of commerce, the weight and perplexity of\r\nlegislation, and the entangled state of European politics, would daily\r\nhave shown to the continent the impossibility of continuing subordinate;\r\nfor, after the coolest reflections on the matter, this must be allowed,\r\nthat Britain was too jealous of America to govern it justly; too\r\nignorant of it to govern it well; and too far distant from it to govern\r\nit at all.\r\n\r\nIV. But what weigh most with all men of serious reflection are, the\r\nmoral advantages arising from independence: war and desolation have\r\nbecome the trade of the old world; and America neither could nor can be\r\nunder the government of Britain without becoming a sharer of her\r\nguilt, and a partner in all the dismal commerce of death. The spirit\r\nof duelling, extended on a national scale, is a proper character for\r\nEuropean wars. They have seldom any other motive than pride, or any\r\nother object than fame. The conquerors and the conquered are generally\r\nruined alike, and the chief difference at last is, that the one marches\r\nhome with his honors, and the other without them. 'Tis the natural\r\ntemper of the English to fight for a feather, if they suppose that\r\nfeather to be an affront; and America, without the right of asking why,\r\nmust have abetted in every quarrel, and abided by its fate. It is a\r\nshocking situation to live in, that one country must be brought into all\r\nthe wars of another, whether the measure be right or wrong, or whether\r\nshe will or not; yet this, in the fullest extent, was, and ever would\r\nbe, the unavoidable consequence of the connection. Surely the Quakers\r\nforgot their own principles when, in their late Testimony, they called\r\nthis connection, with these military and miserable appendages hanging to\r\nit--\"the happy constitution.\"\r\n\r\nBritain, for centuries past, has been nearly fifty years out of every\r\nhundred at war with some power or other. It certainly ought to be a\r\nconscientious as well political consideration with America, not to\r\ndip her hands in the bloody work of Europe. Our situation affords us\r\na retreat from their cabals, and the present happy union of the states\r\nbids fair for extirpating the future use of arms from one quarter of\r\nthe world; yet such have been the irreligious politics of the present\r\nleaders of the Quakers, that, for the sake of they scarce know what,\r\nthey would cut off every hope of such a blessing by tying this continent\r\nto Britain, like Hector to the chariot wheel of Achilles, to be dragged\r\nthrough all the miseries of endless European wars.\r\n\r\nThe connection, viewed from this ground, is distressing to every man\r\nwho has the feelings of humanity. By having Britain for our master, we\r\nbecame enemies to the greatest part of Europe, and they to us: and the\r\nconsequence was war inevitable. By being our own masters, independent of\r\nany foreign one, we have Europe for our friends, and the prospect of an\r\nendless peace among ourselves. Those who were advocates for the British\r\ngovernment over these colonies, were obliged to limit both their\r\narguments and their ideas to the period of an European peace only; the\r\nmoment Britain became plunged in war, every supposed convenience to us\r\nvanished, and all we could hope for was not to be ruined. Could this be\r\na desirable condition for a young country to be in?\r\n\r\nHad the French pursued their fortune immediately after the defeat of\r\nBraddock last war, this city and province had then experienced the woful\r\ncalamities of being a British subject. A scene of the same kind might\r\nhappen again; for America, considered as a subject to the crown\r\nof Britain, would ever have been the seat of war, and the bone of\r\ncontention between the two powers.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, if the future expulsion of arms from one quarter of the\r\nworld would be a desirable object to a peaceable man; if the freedom of\r\ntrade to every part of it can engage the attention of a man of business;\r\nif the support or fall of millions of currency can affect our interests;\r\nif the entire possession of estates, by cutting off the lordly claims\r\nof Britain over the soil, deserves the regard of landed property; and if\r\nthe right of making our own laws, uncontrolled by royal or ministerial\r\nspies or mandates, be worthy our care as freemen;--then are all men\r\ninterested in the support of independence; and may he that supports it\r\nnot, be driven from the blessing, and live unpitied beneath the servile\r\nsufferings of scandalous subjection!\r\n\r\nWe have been amused with the tales of ancient wonders; we have read,\r\nand wept over the histories of other nations: applauded, censured, or\r\npitied, as their cases affected us. The fortitude and patience of the\r\nsufferers--the justness of their cause--the weight of their oppressions\r\nand oppressors--the object to be saved or lost--with all the\r\nconsequences of a defeat or a conquest--have, in the hour of sympathy,\r\nbewitched our hearts, and chained it to their fate: but where is the\r\npower that ever made war upon petitioners? Or where is the war on which\r\na world was staked till now?\r\n\r\nWe may not, perhaps, be wise enough to make all the advantages we ought\r\nof our independence; but they are, nevertheless, marked and presented\r\nto us with every character of great and good, and worthy the hand of\r\nhim who sent them. I look through the present trouble to a time of\r\ntranquillity, when we shall have it in our power to set an example of\r\npeace to all the world. Were the Quakers really impressed and influenced\r\nby the quiet principles they profess to hold, they would, however\r\nthey might disapprove the means, be the first of all men to approve of\r\nindependence, because, by separating ourselves from the cities of Sodom\r\nand Gomorrah, it affords an opportunity never given to man before of\r\ncarrying their favourite principle of peace into general practice, by\r\nestablishing governments that shall hereafter exist without wars. O! ye\r\nfallen, cringing, priest-and-Pemberton-ridden people! What more can we\r\nsay of ye than that a religious Quaker is a valuable character, and a\r\npolitical Quaker a real Jesuit.\r\n\r\nHaving thus gone over some of the principal points in support of\r\nindependence, I must now request the reader to return back with me to\r\nthe period when it first began to be a public doctrine, and to examine\r\nthe progress it has made among the various classes of men. The area I\r\nmean to begin at, is the breaking out of hostilities, April 19th, 1775.\r\nUntil this event happened, the continent seemed to view the dispute as\r\na kind of law-suit for a matter of right, litigating between the old\r\ncountry and the new; and she felt the same kind and degree of horror,\r\nas if she had seen an oppressive plaintiff, at the head of a band of\r\nruffians, enter the court, while the cause was before it, and put the\r\njudge, the jury, the defendant and his counsel, to the sword. Perhaps a\r\nmore heart-felt convulsion never reached a country with the same\r\ndegree of power and rapidity before, and never may again. Pity for the\r\nsufferers, mixed with indignation at the violence, and heightened with\r\napprehensions of undergoing the same fate, made the affair of Lexington\r\nthe affair of the continent. Every part of it felt the shock, and all\r\nvibrated together. A general promotion of sentiment took place: those\r\nwho had drank deeply into Whiggish principles, that is, the right and\r\nnecessity not only of opposing, but wholly setting aside the power of\r\nthe crown as soon as it became practically dangerous (for in theory\r\nit was always so), stepped into the first stage of independence; while\r\nanother class of Whigs, equally sound in principle, but not so sanguine\r\nin enterprise, attached themselves the stronger to the cause, and fell\r\nclose in with the rear of the former; their partition was a mere point.\r\nNumbers of the moderate men, whose chief fault, at that time, arose from\r\nentertaining a better opinion of Britain than she deserved, convinced\r\nnow of their mistake, gave her up, and publicly declared themselves\r\ngood Whigs. While the Tories, seeing it was no longer a laughing matter,\r\neither sank into silent obscurity, or contented themselves with coming\r\nforth and abusing General Gage: not a single advocate appeared to\r\njustify the action of that day; it seemed to appear to every one with\r\nthe same magnitude, struck every one with the same force, and created in\r\nevery one the same abhorrence. From this period we may date the growth\r\nof independence.\r\n\r\nIf the many circumstances which happened at this memorable time, be\r\ntaken in one view, and compared with each other, they will justify a\r\nconclusion which seems not to have been attended to, I mean a fixed\r\ndesign in the king and ministry of driving America into arms, in order\r\nthat they might be furnished with a pretence for seizing the whole\r\ncontinent, as the immediate property of the crown. A noble plunder for\r\nhungry courtiers!\r\n\r\nIt ought to be remembered, that the first petition from the Congress\r\nwas at this time unanswered on the part of the British king. That the\r\nmotion, called Lord North's motion, of the 20th of February, 1775,\r\narrived in America the latter end of March. This motion was to be laid,\r\nby the several governors then in being, before, the assembly of each\r\nprovince; and the first assembly before which it was laid, was the\r\nassembly of Pennsylvania, in May following. This being a just state of\r\nthe case, I then ask, why were hostilities commenced between the time\r\nof passing the resolve in the House of Commons, of the 20th of February,\r\nand the time of the assemblies meeting to deliberate upon it? Degrading\r\nand famous as that motion was, there is nevertheless reason to believe\r\nthat the king and his adherents were afraid the colonies would agree\r\nto it, and lest they should, took effectual care they should not, by\r\nprovoking them with hostilities in the interim. They had not the least\r\ndoubt at that time of conquering America at one blow; and what they\r\nexpected to get by a conquest being infinitely greater than any thing\r\nthey could hope to get either by taxation or accommodation, they seemed\r\ndetermined to prevent even the possibility of hearing each other, lest\r\nAmerica should disappoint their greedy hopes of the whole, by listening\r\neven to their own terms. On the one hand they refused to hear the\r\npetition of the continent, and on the other hand took effectual care the\r\ncontinent should not hear them.\r\n\r\nThat the motion of the 20th February and the orders for commencing\r\nhostilities were both concerted by the same person or persons, and not\r\nthe latter by General Gage, as was falsely imagined at first, is evident\r\nfrom an extract of a letter of his to the administration, read among\r\nother papers in the House of Commons; in which he informs his masters,\r\n\"That though their idea of his disarming certain counties was a right\r\none, yet it required him to be master of the country, in order to enable\r\nhim to execute it.\" This was prior to the commencement of hostilities,\r\nand consequently before the motion of the 20th February could be\r\ndeliberated on by the several assemblies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be asked, why was the motion passed, if there was at the\r\nsame time a plan to aggravate the Americans not to listen to it? Lord\r\nNorth assigned one reason himself, which was a hope of dividing them.\r\nThis was publicly tempting them to reject it; that if, in case the\r\ninjury of arms should fail in provoking them sufficiently, the insult\r\nof such a declaration might fill it up. But by passing the motion and\r\ngetting it afterwards rejected in America, it enabled them, in their\r\nwicked idea of politics, among other things, to hold up the colonies to\r\nforeign powers, with every possible mark of disobedience and rebellion.\r\nThey had applied to those powers not to supply the continent with arms,\r\nammunition, etc., and it was necessary they should incense them against\r\nus, by assigning on their own part some seeming reputable reason why.\r\nBy dividing, it had a tendency to weaken the States, and likewise to\r\nperplex the adherents of America in England. But the principal scheme,\r\nand that which has marked their character in every part of their\r\nconduct, was a design of precipitating the colonies into a state which\r\nthey might afterwards deem rebellion, and, under that pretence, put an\r\nend to all future complaints, petitions and remonstrances, by seizing\r\nthe whole at once. They had ravaged one part of the globe, till it could\r\nglut them no longer; their prodigality required new plunder, and through\r\nthe East India article tea they hoped to transfer their rapine from that\r\nquarter of the world to this. Every designed quarrel had its pretence;\r\nand the same barbarian avarice accompanied the plant to America, which\r\nruined the country that produced it.\r\n\r\nThat men never turn rogues without turning fools is a maxim, sooner or\r\nlater, universally true. The commencement of hostilities, being in the\r\nbeginning of April, was, of all times the worst chosen: the Congress\r\nwere to meet the tenth of May following, and the distress the continent\r\nfelt at this unparalleled outrage gave a stability to that body which\r\nno other circumstance could have done. It suppressed too all inferior\r\ndebates, and bound them together by a necessitous affection, without\r\ngiving them time to differ upon trifles. The suffering likewise softened\r\nthe whole body of the people into a degree of pliability, which laid the\r\nprincipal foundation-stone of union, order, and government; and which,\r\nat any other time, might only have fretted and then faded away\r\nunnoticed and unimproved. But Providence, who best knows how to time her\r\nmisfortunes as well as her immediate favors, chose this to be the time,\r\nand who dare dispute it?\r\n\r\nIt did not seem the disposition of the people, at this crisis, to\r\nheap petition upon petition, while the former remained unanswered. The\r\nmeasure however was carried in Congress, and a second petition was sent;\r\nof which I shall only remark that it was submissive even to a dangerous\r\nfault, because the prayer of it appealed solely to what it called the\r\nprerogative of the crown, while the matter in dispute was confessedly\r\nconstitutional. But even this petition, flattering as it was, was\r\nstill not so harmonious as the chink of cash, and consequently not\r\nsufficiently grateful to the tyrant and his ministry. From every\r\ncircumstance it is evident, that it was the determination of the British\r\ncourt to have nothing to do with America but to conquer her fully and\r\nabsolutely. They were certain of success, and the field of battle was\r\nthe only place of treaty. I am confident there are thousands and tens of\r\nthousands in America who wonder now that they should ever have thought\r\notherwise; but the sin of that day was the sin of civility; yet it\r\noperated against our present good in the same manner that a civil\r\nopinion of the devil would against our future peace.\r\n\r\nIndependence was a doctrine scarce and rare, even towards the conclusion\r\nof the year 1775; all our politics had been founded on the hope of\r\nexpectation of making the matter up--a hope, which, though general on\r\nthe side of America, had never entered the head or heart of the British\r\ncourt. Their hope was conquest and confiscation. Good heavens! what\r\nvolumes of thanks does America owe to Britain? What infinite obligation\r\nto the tool that fills, with paradoxical vacancy, the throne! Nothing\r\nbut the sharpest essence of villany, compounded with the strongest\r\ndistillation of folly, could have produced a menstruum that would have\r\neffected a separation. The Congress in 1774 administered an abortive\r\nmedicine to independence, by prohibiting the importation of goods,\r\nand the succeeding Congress rendered the dose still more dangerous by\r\ncontinuing it. Had independence been a settled system with America, (as\r\nBritain has advanced,) she ought to have doubled her importation, and\r\nprohibited in some degree her exportation. And this single circumstance\r\nis sufficient to acquit America before any jury of nations, of having\r\na continental plan of independence in view; a charge which, had it been\r\ntrue, would have been honorable, but is so grossly false, that either\r\nthe amazing ignorance or the wilful dishonesty of the British court is\r\neffectually proved by it.\r\n\r\nThe second petition, like the first, produced no answer; it was\r\nscarcely acknowledged to have been received; the British court were too\r\ndetermined in their villainy even to act it artfully, and in their rage\r\nfor conquest neglected the necessary subtleties for obtaining it. They\r\nmight have divided, distracted and played a thousand tricks with us, had\r\nthey been as cunning as they were cruel.\r\n\r\nThis last indignity gave a new spring to independence. Those who knew\r\nthe savage obstinacy of the king, and the jobbing, gambling spirit of\r\nthe court, predicted the fate of the petition, as soon as it was sent\r\nfrom America; for the men being known, their measures were easily\r\nforeseen. As politicians we ought not so much to ground our hopes on\r\nthe reasonableness of the thing we ask, as on the reasonableness of\r\nthe person of whom we ask it: who would expect discretion from a fool,\r\ncandor from a tyrant, or justice from a villain?\r\n\r\nAs every prospect of accommodation seemed now to fail fast, men began to\r\nthink seriously on the matter; and their reason being thus stripped of\r\nthe false hope which had long encompassed it, became approachable by\r\nfair debate: yet still the bulk of the people hesitated; they startled\r\nat the novelty of independence, without once considering that our\r\ngetting into arms at first was a more extraordinary novelty, and that\r\nall other nations had gone through the work of independence before\r\nus. They doubted likewise the ability of the continent to support\r\nit, without reflecting that it required the same force to obtain an\r\naccommodation by arms as an independence. If the one was acquirable, the\r\nother was the same; because, to accomplish either, it was necessary that\r\nour strength should be too great for Britain to subdue; and it was too\r\nunreasonable to suppose, that with the power of being masters, we should\r\nsubmit to be servants.* Their caution at this time was exceedingly\r\nmisplaced; for if they were able to defend their property and maintain\r\ntheir rights by arms, they, consequently, were able to defend and\r\nsupport their independence; and in proportion as these men saw the\r\nnecessity and correctness of the measure, they honestly and openly\r\ndeclared and adopted it, and the part that they had acted since has done\r\nthem honor and fully established their characters. Error in opinion has\r\nthis peculiar advantage with it, that the foremost point of the contrary\r\nground may at any time be reached by the sudden exertion of a thought;\r\nand it frequently happens in sentimental differences, that some striking\r\ncircumstance, or some forcible reason quickly conceived, will effect in\r\nan instant what neither argument nor example could produce in an age.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * In this state of political suspense the pamphlet Common Sense made\r\nits appearance, and the success it met with does not become me to\r\nmention. Dr. Franklin, Mr. Samuel and John Adams, were severally spoken\r\nof as the supposed author. I had not, at that time, the pleasure either\r\nof personally knowing or being known to the two last gentlemen. The\r\nfavor of Dr. Franklin's friendship I possessed in England, and my\r\nintroduction to this part of the world was through his patronage. I\r\nhappened, when a school-boy, to pick up a pleasing natural history of\r\nVirginia, and my inclination from that day of seeing the western side\r\nof the Atlantic never left me. In October, 1775, Dr. Franklin proposed\r\ngiving me such materials as were in his hands, towards completing a\r\nhistory of the present transactions, and seemed desirous of having the\r\nfirst volume out the next Spring. I had then formed the outlines of\r\nCommon Sense, and finished nearly the first part; and as I supposed the\r\ndoctor's design in getting out a history was to open the new year with\r\na new system, I expected to surprise him with a production on that\r\nsubject, much earlier than he thought of; and without informing him what\r\nI was doing, got it ready for the press as fast as I conveniently could,\r\nand sent him the first pamphlet that was printed off.\r\n\r\nI find it impossible in the small compass I am limited to, to trace out\r\nthe progress which independence has made on the minds of the different\r\nclasses of men, and the several reasons by which they were moved. With\r\nsome, it was a passionate abhorrence against the king of England and his\r\nministry, as a set of savages and brutes; and these men, governed by\r\nthe agony of a wounded mind, were for trusting every thing to hope and\r\nheaven, and bidding defiance at once. With others, it was a growing\r\nconviction that the scheme of the British court was to create, ferment\r\nand drive on a quarrel, for the sake of confiscated plunder: and men\r\nof this class ripened into independence in proportion as the evidence\r\nincreased. While a third class conceived it was the true interest of\r\nAmerica, internally and externally, to be her own master, and gave their\r\nsupport to independence, step by step, as they saw her abilities to\r\nmaintain it enlarge. With many, it was a compound of all these reasons;\r\nwhile those who were too callous to be reached by either, remained, and\r\nstill remain Tories.\r\n\r\nThe legal necessity of being independent, with several collateral\r\nreasons, is pointed out in an elegant masterly manner, in a charge to\r\nthe grand jury for the district of Charleston, by the Hon. William\r\nHenry Drayton, chief justice of South Carolina, [April 23, 1776]. This\r\nperformance, and the address of the convention of New York, are pieces,\r\nin my humble opinion, of the first rank in America.\r\n\r\nThe principal causes why independence has not been so universally\r\nsupported as it ought, are fear and indolence, and the causes why it\r\nhas been opposed, are, avarice, down-right villany, and lust of personal\r\npower. There is not such a being in America as a Tory from conscience;\r\nsome secret defect or other is interwoven in the character of all those,\r\nbe they men or women, who can look with patience on the brutality,\r\nluxury and debauchery of the British court, and the violations of their\r\narmy here. A woman's virtue must sit very lightly on her who can even\r\nhint a favorable sentiment in their behalf. It is remarkable that the\r\nwhole race of prostitutes in New York were tories; and the schemes for\r\nsupporting the Tory cause in this city, for which several are now\r\nin jail, and one hanged, were concerted and carried on in common\r\nbawdy-houses, assisted by those who kept them.\r\n\r\nThe connection between vice and meanness is a fit subject for satire,\r\nbut when the satire is a fact, it cuts with the irresistible power of a\r\ndiamond. If a Quaker, in defence of his just rights, his property,\r\nand the chastity of his house, takes up a musket, he is expelled the\r\nmeeting; but the present king of England, who seduced and took into\r\nkeeping a sister of their society, is reverenced and supported by\r\nrepeated Testimonies, while, the friendly noodle from whom she was taken\r\n(and who is now in this city) continues a drudge in the service of his\r\nrival, as if proud of being cuckolded by a creature called a king.\r\n\r\nOur support and success depend on such a variety of men and\r\ncircumstances, that every one who does but wish well, is of some use:\r\nthere are men who have a strange aversion to arms, yet have hearts to\r\nrisk every shilling in the cause, or in support of those who have better\r\ntalents for defending it. Nature, in the arrangement of mankind, has\r\nfitted some for every service in life: were all soldiers, all would\r\nstarve and go naked, and were none soldiers, all would be slaves. As\r\ndisaffection to independence is the badge of a Tory, so affection to\r\nit is the mark of a Whig; and the different services of the Whigs, down\r\nfrom those who nobly contribute every thing, to those who have nothing\r\nto render but their wishes, tend all to the same center, though with\r\ndifferent degrees of merit and ability. The larger we make the circle,\r\nthe more we shall harmonize, and the stronger we shall be. All we want\r\nto shut out is disaffection, and, that excluded, we must accept from\r\neach other such duties as we are best fitted to bestow. A narrow system\r\nof politics, like a narrow system of religion, is calculated only to\r\nsour the temper, and be at variance with mankind.\r\n\r\nAll we want to know in America is simply this, who is for independence,\r\nand who is not? Those who are for it, will support it, and the remainder\r\nwill undoubtedly see the reasonableness of paying the charges; while\r\nthose who oppose or seek to betray it, must expect the more rigid fate\r\nof the jail and the gibbet. There is a bastard kind of generosity, which\r\nbeing extended to all men, is as fatal to society, on one hand, as the\r\nwant of true generosity is on the other. A lax manner of administering\r\njustice, falsely termed moderation, has a tendency both to dispirit\r\npublic virtue, and promote the growth of public evils. Had the late\r\ncommittee of safety taken cognizance of the last Testimony of the\r\nQuakers and proceeded against such delinquents as were concerned\r\ntherein, they had, probably, prevented the treasonable plans which\r\nhave been concerted since. When one villain is suffered to escape, it\r\nencourages another to proceed, either from a hope of escaping likewise,\r\nor an apprehension that we dare not punish. It has been a matter of\r\ngeneral surprise, that no notice was taken of the incendiary publication\r\nof the Quakers, of the 20th of November last; a publication evidently\r\nintended to promote sedition and treason, and encourage the enemy, who\r\nwere then within a day's march of this city, to proceed on and possess\r\nit. I here present the reader with a memorial which was laid before the\r\nboard of safety a few days after the Testimony appeared. Not a member of\r\nthat board, that I conversed with, but expressed the highest detestation\r\nof the perverted principles and conduct of the Quaker junto, and a wish\r\nthat the board would take the matter up; notwithstanding which, it was\r\nsuffered to pass away unnoticed, to the encouragement of new acts of\r\ntreason, the general danger of the cause, and the disgrace of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        To the honorable the Council of Safety of the State of\r\n                            Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of a reputable number of the inhabitants of the city of\r\nPhiladelphia, impressed with a proper sense of the justice of the cause\r\nwhich this continent is engaged in, and animated with a generous fervor\r\nfor supporting the same, it was resolved, that the following be laid\r\nbefore the board of safety:\r\n\r\n\"We profess liberality of sentiment to all men; with this distinction\r\nonly, that those who do not deserve it would become wise and seek\r\nto deserve it. We hold the pure doctrines of universal liberty of\r\nconscience, and conceive it our duty to endeavor to secure that sacred\r\nright to others, as well as to defend it for ourselves; for we undertake\r\nnot to judge of the religious rectitude of tenets, but leave the whole\r\nmatter to Him who made us.\r\n\r\n\"We persecute no man, neither will we abet in the persecution of any\r\nman for religion's sake; our common relation to others being that of\r\nfellow-citizens and fellow-subjects of one single community; and in this\r\nline of connection we hold out the right hand of fellowship to all men.\r\nBut we should conceive ourselves to be unworthy members of the free and\r\nindependent States of America, were we unconcernedly to see or to suffer\r\nany treasonable wound, public or private, directly or indirectly, to be\r\ngiven against the peace and safety of the same. We inquire not into the\r\nrank of the offenders, nor into their religious persuasion; we have no\r\nbusiness with either, our part being only to find them out and exhibit\r\nthem to justice.\r\n\r\n\"A printed paper, dated the 20th of November, and signed 'John\r\nPemberton,' whom we suppose to be an inhabitant of this city, has lately\r\nbeen dispersed abroad, a copy of which accompanies this. Had the framers\r\nand publishers of that paper conceived it their duty to exhort the youth\r\nand others of their society, to a patient submission under the present\r\ntrying visitations, and humbly to wait the event of heaven towards them,\r\nthey had therein shown a Christian temper, and we had been silent; but\r\nthe anger and political virulence with which their instructions are\r\ngiven, and the abuse with which they stigmatize all ranks of men not\r\nthinking like themselves, leave no doubt on our minds from what spirit\r\ntheir publication proceeded: and it is disgraceful to the pure cause of\r\ntruth, that men can dally with words of the most sacred import, and play\r\nthem off as mechanically as if religion consisted only in contrivance.\r\nWe know of no instance in which the Quakers have been compelled to bear\r\narms, or to do any thing which might strain their conscience; wherefore\r\ntheir advice, 'to withstand and refuse to submit to the arbitrary\r\ninstructions and ordinances of men,' appear to us a false alarm, and\r\ncould only be treasonably calculated to gain favor with our enemies,\r\nwhen they are seemingly on the brink of invading this State, or, what\r\nis still worse, to weaken the hands of our defence, that their entrance\r\ninto this city might be made practicable and easy.\r\n\r\n\"We disclaim all tumult and disorder in the punishment of offenders;\r\nand wish to be governed, not by temper but by reason, in the manner of\r\ntreating them. We are sensible that our cause has suffered by the two\r\nfollowing errors: first, by ill-judged lenity to traitorous persons in\r\nsome cases; and, secondly, by only a passionate treatment of them in\r\nothers. For the future we disown both, and wish to be steady in our\r\nproceedings, and serious in our punishments.\r\n\r\n\"Every State in America has, by the repeated voice of its inhabitants,\r\ndirected and authorized the Continental Congress to publish a formal\r\nDeclaration of Independence of, and separation from, the oppressive king\r\nand Parliament of Great Britain; and we look on every man as an\r\nenemy, who does not in some line or other, give his assistance towards\r\nsupporting the same; at the same time we consider the offence to be\r\nheightened to a degree of unpardonable guilt, when such persons,\r\nunder the show of religion, endeavor, either by writing, speaking, or\r\notherwise, to subvert, overturn, or bring reproach upon the independence\r\nof this continent as declared by Congress.\r\n\r\n\"The publishers of the paper signed 'John Pemberton,' have called in a\r\nloud manner to their friends and connections, 'to withstand or refuse'\r\nobedience to whatever 'instructions or ordinances' may be published, not\r\nwarranted by (what they call) 'that happy Constitution under which they\r\nand others long enjoyed tranquillity and peace.' If this be not treason,\r\nwe know not what may properly be called by that name.\r\n\r\n\"To us it is a matter of surprise and astonishment, that men with the\r\nword 'peace, peace,' continually on their lips, should be so fond of\r\nliving under and supporting a government, and at the same time calling\r\nit 'happy,' which is never better pleased than when a war--that has\r\nfilled India with carnage and famine, Africa with slavery, and tampered\r\nwith Indians and negroes to cut the throats of the freemen of America.\r\nWe conceive it a disgrace to this State, to harbor or wink at such\r\npalpable hypocrisy. But as we seek not to hurt the hair of any man's\r\nhead, when we can make ourselves safe without, we wish such persons to\r\nrestore peace to themselves and us, by removing themselves to some part\r\nof the king of Great Britain's dominions, as by that means they may live\r\nunmolested by us and we by them; for our fixed opinion is, that those\r\nwho do not deserve a place among us, ought not to have one.\r\n\r\n\"We conclude with requesting the Council of Safety to take into\r\nconsideration the paper signed 'John Pemberton,' and if it shall appear\r\nto them to be of a dangerous tendency, or of a treasonable nature, that\r\nthey would commit the signer, together with such other persons as they\r\ncan discover were concerned therein, into custody, until such time as\r\nsome mode of trial shall ascertain the full degree of their guilt and\r\npunishment; in the doing of which, we wish their judges, whoever\r\nthey may be, to disregard the man, his connections, interest, riches,\r\npoverty, or principles of religion, and to attend to the nature of his\r\noffence only.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most cavilling sectarian cannot accuse the foregoing with containing\r\nthe least ingredient of persecution. The free spirit on which the\r\nAmerican cause is founded, disdains to mix with such an impurity, and\r\nleaves it as rubbish fit only for narrow and suspicious minds to grovel\r\nin. Suspicion and persecution are weeds of the same dunghill, and\r\nflourish together. Had the Quakers minded their religion and their\r\nbusiness, they might have lived through this dispute in enviable ease,\r\nand none would have molested them. The common phrase with these people\r\nis, 'Our principles are peace.' To which may be replied, and your\r\npractices are the reverse; for never did the conduct of men oppose their\r\nown doctrine more notoriously than the present race of the Quakers. They\r\nhave artfully changed themselves into a different sort of people to what\r\nthey used to be, and yet have the address to persuade each other that\r\nthey are not altered; like antiquated virgins, they see not the havoc\r\ndeformity has made upon them, but pleasantly mistaking wrinkles for\r\ndimples, conceive themselves yet lovely and wonder at the stupid world\r\nfor not admiring them.\r\n\r\nDid no injury arise to the public by this apostacy of the Quakers from\r\nthemselves, the public would have nothing to do with it; but as both the\r\ndesign and consequences are pointed against a cause in which the whole\r\ncommunity are interested, it is therefore no longer a subject confined\r\nto the cognizance of the meeting only, but comes, as a matter of\r\ncriminality, before the authority either of the particular State in\r\nwhich it is acted, or of the continent against which it operates. Every\r\nattempt, now, to support the authority of the king and Parliament of\r\nGreat Britain over America, is treason against every State; therefore\r\nit is impossible that any one can pardon or screen from punishment an\r\noffender against all.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed: while the infatuated Tories of this and other States\r\nwere last spring talking of commissioners, accommodation, making the\r\nmatter up, and the Lord knows what stuff and nonsense, their good king\r\nand ministry were glutting themselves with the revenge of reducing\r\nAmerica to unconditional submission, and solacing each other with the\r\ncertainty of conquering it in one campaign. The following quotations are\r\nfrom the parliamentary register of the debate's of the House of Lords,\r\nMarch 5th, 1776:\r\n\r\n\"The Americans,\" says Lord Talbot,* \"have been obstinate, undutiful, and\r\nungovernable from the very beginning, from their first early and infant\r\nsettlements; and I am every day more and more convinced that this people\r\nnever will be brought back to their duty, and the subordinate relation\r\nthey stand in to this country, till reduced to unconditional, effectual\r\nsubmission; no concession on our part, no lenity, no endurance, will\r\nhave any other effect but that of increasing their insolence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Steward of the king's household.\r\n\r\n\"The struggle,\" says Lord Townsend,* \"is now a struggle for power; the\r\ndie is cast, and the only point which now remains to be determined is,\r\nin what manner the war can be most effectually prosecuted and speedily\r\nfinished, in order to procure that unconditional submission, which has\r\nbeen so ably stated by the noble Earl with the white staff\" (meaning\r\nLord Talbot;) \"and I have no reason to doubt that the measures now\r\npursuing will put an end to the war in the course of a single campaign.\r\nShould it linger longer, we shall then have reason to expect that\r\nsome foreign power will interfere, and take advantage of our domestic\r\ntroubles and civil distractions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Formerly General Townsend, at Quebec, and late lord-lieutenant of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nLord Littleton. \"My sentiments are pretty well known. I shall only\r\nobserve now that lenient measures have had no other effect than to\r\nproduce insult after insult; that the more we conceded, the higher\r\nAmerica rose in her demands, and the more insolent she has grown. It\r\nis for this reason that I am now for the most effective and decisive\r\nmeasures; and am of opinion that no alternative is left us, but to\r\nrelinquish America for ever, or finally determine to compel her to\r\nacknowledge the legislative authority of this country; and it is the\r\nprinciple of an unconditional submission I would be for maintaining.\"\r\n\r\nCan words be more expressive than these? Surely the Tories will believe\r\nthe Tory lords! The truth is, they do believe them and know as fully as\r\nany Whig on the continent knows, that the king and ministry never had\r\nthe least design of an accommodation with America, but an absolute,\r\nunconditional conquest. And the part which the Tories were to act, was,\r\nby downright lying, to endeavor to put the continent off its guard, and\r\nto divide and sow discontent in the minds of such Whigs as they might\r\ngain an influence over. In short, to keep up a distraction here, that\r\nthe force sent from England might be able to conquer in \"one campaign.\"\r\nThey and the ministry were, by a different game, playing into each\r\nother's hands. The cry of the Tories in England was, \"No reconciliation,\r\nno accommodation,\" in order to obtain the greater military force;\r\nwhile those in America were crying nothing but \"reconciliation and\r\naccommodation,\" that the force sent might conquer with the less\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nBut this \"single campaign\" is over, and America not conquered. The\r\nwhole work is yet to do, and the force much less to do it with. Their\r\ncondition is both despicable and deplorable: out of cash--out of heart,\r\nand out of hope. A country furnished with arms and ammunition as America\r\nnow is, with three millions of inhabitants, and three thousand miles\r\ndistant from the nearest enemy that can approach her, is able to look\r\nand laugh them in the face.\r\n\r\nHowe appears to have two objects in view, either to go up the North\r\nRiver, or come to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nBy going up the North River, he secures a retreat for his army through\r\nCanada, but the ships must return if they return at all, the same way\r\nthey went; as our army would be in the rear, the safety of their passage\r\ndown is a doubtful matter. By such a motion he shuts himself from all\r\nsupplies from Europe, but through Canada, and exposes his army and\r\nnavy to the danger of perishing. The idea of his cutting off the\r\ncommunication between the eastern and southern states, by means of\r\nthe North River, is merely visionary. He cannot do it by his shipping;\r\nbecause no ship can lay long at anchor in any river within reach of the\r\nshore; a single gun would drive a first rate from such a station. This\r\nwas fully proved last October at Forts Washington and Lee, where one\r\ngun only, on each side of the river, obliged two frigates to cut and\r\nbe towed off in an hour's time. Neither can he cut it off by his army;\r\nbecause the several posts they must occupy would divide them almost\r\nto nothing, and expose them to be picked up by ours like pebbles on a\r\nriver's bank; but admitting that he could, where is the injury? Because,\r\nwhile his whole force is cantoned out, as sentries over the water, they\r\nwill be very innocently employed, and the moment they march into the\r\ncountry the communication opens.\r\n\r\nThe most probable object is Philadelphia, and the reasons are many.\r\nHowe's business is to conquer it, and in proportion as he finds himself\r\nunable to the task, he will employ his strength to distress women and\r\nweak minds, in order to accomplish through their fears what he cannot\r\naccomplish by his own force. His coming or attempting to come to\r\nPhiladelphia is a circumstance that proves his weakness: for no general\r\nthat felt himself able to take the field and attack his antagonist would\r\nthink of bringing his army into a city in the summer time; and this mere\r\nshifting the scene from place to place, without effecting any thing,\r\nhas feebleness and cowardice on the face of it, and holds him up in a\r\ncontemptible light to all who can reason justly and firmly. By several\r\ninformations from New York, it appears that their army in general, both\r\nofficers and men, have given up the expectation of conquering America;\r\ntheir eye now is fixed upon the spoil. They suppose Philadelphia to be\r\nrich with stores, and as they think to get more by robbing a town than\r\nby attacking an army, their movement towards this city is probable. We\r\nare not now contending against an army of soldiers, but against a band\r\nof thieves, who had rather plunder than fight, and have no other hope of\r\nconquest than by cruelty.\r\n\r\nThey expect to get a mighty booty, and strike another general panic, by\r\nmaking a sudden movement and getting possession of this city; but unless\r\nthey can march out as well as in, or get the entire command of the\r\nriver, to remove off their plunder, they may probably be stopped with\r\nthe stolen goods upon them. They have never yet succeeded wherever they\r\nhave been opposed, but at Fort Washington. At Charleston their defeat\r\nwas effectual. At Ticonderoga they ran away. In every skirmish at\r\nKingsbridge and the White Plains they were obliged to retreat, and the\r\ninstant that our arms were turned upon them in the Jerseys, they turned\r\nlikewise, and those that turned not were taken.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of always fitting our internal police to the circumstances\r\nof the times we live in, is something so strikingly obvious, that no\r\nsufficient objection can be made against it. The safety of all\r\nsocieties depends upon it; and where this point is not attended to,\r\nthe consequences will either be a general languor or a tumult. The\r\nencouragement and protection of the good subjects of any state, and the\r\nsuppression and punishment of bad ones, are the principal objects for\r\nwhich all authority is instituted, and the line in which it ought to\r\noperate. We have in this city a strange variety of men and characters,\r\nand the circumstances of the times require that they should be publicly\r\nknown; it is not the number of Tories that hurt us, so much as the not\r\nfinding out who they are; men must now take one side or the other, and\r\nabide by the consequences: the Quakers, trusting to their short-sighted\r\nsagacity, have, most unluckily for them, made their declaration in their\r\nlast Testimony, and we ought now to take them at their word. They have\r\ninvoluntarily read themselves out of the continental meeting, and cannot\r\nhope to be restored to it again but by payment and penitence. Men whose\r\npolitical principles are founded on avarice, are beyond the reach\r\nof reason, and the only cure of Toryism of this cast is to tax it.\r\nA substantial good drawn from a real evil, is of the same benefit to\r\nsociety, as if drawn from a virtue; and where men have not public spirit\r\nto render themselves serviceable, it ought to be the study of government\r\nto draw the best use possible from their vices. When the governing\r\npassion of any man, or set of men, is once known, the method of managing\r\nthem is easy; for even misers, whom no public virtue can impress, would\r\nbecome generous, could a heavy tax be laid upon covetousness.\r\n\r\nThe Tories have endeavored to insure their property with the enemy, by\r\nforfeiting their reputation with us; from which may be justly inferred,\r\nthat their governing passion is avarice. Make them as much afraid of\r\nlosing on one side as on the other, and you stagger their Toryism; make\r\nthem more so, and you reclaim them; for their principle is to worship\r\nthe power which they are most afraid of.\r\n\r\nThis method of considering men and things together, opens into a large\r\nfield for speculation, and affords me an opportunity of offering some\r\nobservations on the state of our currency, so as to make the support\r\nof it go hand in hand with the suppression of disaffection and the\r\nencouragement of public spirit.\r\n\r\nThe thing which first presents itself in inspecting the state of the\r\ncurrency, is, that we have too much of it, and that there is a necessity\r\nof reducing the quantity, in order to increase the value. Men are daily\r\ngrowing poor by the very means that they take to get rich; for in the\r\nsame proportion that the prices of all goods on hand are raised, the\r\nvalue of all money laid by is reduced. A simple case will make this\r\nclear; let a man have 100 L. in cash, and as many goods on hand as will\r\nto-day sell for 20 L.; but not content with the present market price,\r\nhe raises them to 40 L. and by so doing obliges others, in their own\r\ndefence, to raise cent. per cent. likewise; in this case it is evident\r\nthat his hundred pounds laid by, is reduced fifty pounds in value;\r\nwhereas, had the market lowered cent. per cent., his goods would have\r\nsold but for ten, but his hundred pounds would have risen in value to\r\ntwo hundred; because it would then purchase as many goods again, or\r\nsupport his family as long again as before. And, strange as it may seem,\r\nhe is one hundred and fifty pounds the poorer for raising his goods, to\r\nwhat he would have been had he lowered them; because the forty pounds\r\nwhich his goods sold for, is, by the general raise of the market cent.\r\nper cent., rendered of no more value than the ten pounds would be had\r\nthe market fallen in the same proportion; and, consequently, the whole\r\ndifference of gain or loss is on the difference in value of the hundred\r\npounds laid by, viz. from fifty to two hundred. This rage for raising\r\ngoods is for several reasons much more the fault of the Tories than the\r\nWhigs; and yet the Tories (to their shame and confusion ought they to\r\nbe told of it) are by far the most noisy and discontented. The greatest\r\npart of the Whigs, by being now either in the army or employed in some\r\npublic service, are buyers only and not sellers, and as this evil has\r\nits origin in trade, it cannot be charged on those who are out of it.\r\n\r\nBut the grievance has now become too general to be remedied by partial\r\nmethods, and the only effectual cure is to reduce the quantity of money:\r\nwith half the quantity we should be richer than we are now, because\r\nthe value of it would be doubled, and consequently our attachment to it\r\nincreased; for it is not the number of dollars that a man has, but how\r\nfar they will go, that makes him either rich or poor. These two points\r\nbeing admitted, viz. that the quantity of money is too great, and that\r\nthe prices of goods can only be effectually reduced by, reducing the\r\nquantity of the money, the next point to be considered is, the method\r\nhow to reduce it.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the times, as before observed, require that the\r\npublic characters of all men should now be fully understood, and the\r\nonly general method of ascertaining it is by an oath or affirmation,\r\nrenouncing all allegiance to the king of Great Britain, and to support\r\nthe independence of the United States, as declared by Congress. Let, at\r\nthe same time, a tax of ten, fifteen, or twenty per cent. per annum, to\r\nbe collected quarterly, be levied on all property. These alternatives,\r\nby being perfectly voluntary, will take in all sorts of people. Here\r\nis the test; here is the tax. He who takes the former, conscientiously\r\nproves his affection to the cause, and binds himself to pay his quota\r\nby the best services in his power, and is thereby justly exempt from the\r\nlatter; and those who choose the latter, pay their quota in money, to be\r\nexcused from the former, or rather, it is the price paid to us for their\r\nsupposed, though mistaken, insurance with the enemy.\r\n\r\nBut this is only a part of the advantage which would arise by knowing\r\nthe different characters of men. The Whigs stake everything on the issue\r\nof their arms, while the Tories, by their disaffection, are sapping and\r\nundermining their strength; and, of consequence, the property of the\r\nWhigs is the more exposed thereby; and whatever injury their estates\r\nmay sustain by the movements of the enemy, must either be borne by\r\nthemselves, who have done everything which has yet been done, or by the\r\nTories, who have not only done nothing, but have, by their disaffection,\r\ninvited the enemy on.\r\n\r\nIn the present crisis we ought to know, square by square and house by\r\nhouse, who are in real allegiance with the United Independent States,\r\nand who are not. Let but the line be made clear and distinct, and all\r\nmen will then know what they are to trust to. It would not only be\r\ngood policy but strict justice, to raise fifty or one hundred thousand\r\npounds, or more, if it is necessary, out of the estates and property\r\nof the king of England's votaries, resident in Philadelphia, to be\r\ndistributed, as a reward to those inhabitants of the city and State, who\r\nshould turn out and repulse the enemy, should they attempt to march this\r\nway; and likewise, to bind the property of all such persons to make\r\ngood the damages which that of the Whigs might sustain. In the\r\nundistinguishable mode of conducting a war, we frequently make reprisals\r\nat sea, on the vessels of persons in England, who are friends to our\r\ncause compared with the resident Tories among us.\r\n\r\nIn every former publication of mine, from Common Sense down to the last\r\nCrisis, I have generally gone on the charitable supposition, that the\r\nTories were rather a mistaken than a criminal people, and have applied\r\nargument after argument, with all the candor and temper which I was\r\ncapable of, in order to set every part of the case clearly and fairly\r\nbefore them, and if possible to reclaim them from ruin to reason. I have\r\ndone my duty by them and have now done with that doctrine, taking it for\r\ngranted, that those who yet hold their disaffection are either a set\r\nof avaricious miscreants, who would sacrifice the continent to save\r\nthemselves, or a banditti of hungry traitors, who are hoping for\r\na division of the spoil. To which may be added, a list of crown or\r\nproprietary dependants, who, rather than go without a portion of power,\r\nwould be content to share it with the devil. Of such men there is no\r\nhope; and their obedience will only be according to the danger set\r\nbefore them, and the power that is exercised over them.\r\n\r\nA time will shortly arrive, in which, by ascertaining the characters of\r\npersons now, we shall be guarded against their mischiefs then; for in\r\nproportion as the enemy despair of conquest, they will be trying the\r\narts of seduction and the force of fear by all the mischiefs which they\r\ncan inflict. But in war we may be certain of these two things, viz. that\r\ncruelty in an enemy, and motions made with more than usual parade, are\r\nalways signs of weakness. He that can conquer, finds his mind too free\r\nand pleasant to be brutish; and he that intends to conquer, never makes\r\ntoo much show of his strength.\r\n\r\nWe now know the enemy we have to do with. While drunk with the\r\ncertainty of victory, they disdained to be civil; and in proportion as\r\ndisappointment makes them sober, and their apprehensions of an European\r\nwar alarm them, they will become cringing and artful; honest they cannot\r\nbe. But our answer to them, in either condition they may be in, is short\r\nand full--\"As free and independent States we are willing to make peace\r\nwith you to-morrow, but we neither can hear nor reply in any other\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nIf Britain cannot conquer us, it proves that she is neither able to\r\ngovern nor protect us, and our particular situation now is such, that\r\nany connection with her would be unwisely exchanging a half-defeated\r\nenemy for two powerful ones. Europe, by every appearance, is now on the\r\neve, nay, on the morning twilight of a war, and any alliance with George\r\nthe Third brings France and Spain upon our backs; a separation from him\r\nattaches them to our side; therefore, the only road to peace, honor and\r\ncommerce is Independence.\r\n\r\nWritten this fourth year of the UNION, which God preserve.\r\n\r\n                                            COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, April 19, 1777.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS IV. (THOSE WHO EXPECT TO REAP THE BLESSINGS OF FREEDOM)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOSE who expect to reap the blessings of freedom, must, like men,\r\nundergo the fatigues of supporting it. The event of yesterday was one\r\nof those kind of alarms which is just sufficient to rouse us to duty,\r\nwithout being of consequence enough to depress our fortitude. It is not\r\na field of a few acres of ground, but a cause, that we are defending,\r\nand whether we defeat the enemy in one battle, or by degrees, the\r\nconsequences will be the same.\r\n\r\nLook back at the events of last winter and the present year, there you\r\nwill find that the enemy's successes always contributed to reduce them.\r\nWhat they have gained in ground, they paid so dearly for in numbers,\r\nthat their victories have in the end amounted to defeats. We have always\r\nbeen masters at the last push, and always shall be while we do our duty.\r\nHowe has been once on the banks of the Delaware, and from thence driven\r\nback with loss and disgrace: and why not be again driven from the\r\nSchuylkill? His condition and ours are very different. He has everybody\r\nto fight, we have only his one army to cope with, and which wastes away\r\nat every engagement: we can not only reinforce, but can redouble our\r\nnumbers; he is cut off from all supplies, and must sooner or later\r\ninevitably fall into our hands.\r\n\r\nShall a band of ten or twelve thousand robbers, who are this day fifteen\r\nhundred or two thousand men less in strength than they were yesterday,\r\nconquer America, or subdue even a single state? The thing cannot be,\r\nunless we sit down and suffer them to do it. Another such a brush,\r\nnotwithstanding we lost the ground, would, by still reducing the enemy,\r\nput them in a condition to be afterwards totally defeated. Could our\r\nwhole army have come up to the attack at one time, the consequences\r\nhad probably been otherwise; but our having different parts of\r\nthe Brandywine creek to guard, and the uncertainty which road to\r\nPhiladelphia the enemy would attempt to take, naturally afforded them an\r\nopportunity of passing with their main body at a place where only a\r\npart of ours could be posted; for it must strike every thinking man with\r\nconviction, that it requires a much greater force to oppose an enemy in\r\nseveral places, than is sufficient to defeat him in any one place.\r\n\r\nMen who are sincere in defending their freedom, will always feel concern\r\nat every circumstance which seems to make against them; it is the\r\nnatural and honest consequence of all affectionate attachments, and the\r\nwant of it is a vice. But the dejection lasts only for a moment; they\r\nsoon rise out of it with additional vigor; the glow of hope, courage and\r\nfortitude, will, in a little time, supply the place of every inferior\r\npassion, and kindle the whole heart into heroism.\r\n\r\nThere is a mystery in the countenance of some causes, which we have not\r\nalways present judgment enough to explain. It is distressing to see an\r\nenemy advancing into a country, but it is the only place in which we can\r\nbeat them, and in which we have always beaten them, whenever they made\r\nthe attempt. The nearer any disease approaches to a crisis, the nearer\r\nit is to a cure. Danger and deliverance make their advances together,\r\nand it is only the last push, in which one or the other takes the lead.\r\n\r\nThere are many men who will do their duty when it is not wanted; but a\r\ngenuine public spirit always appears most when there is most occasion\r\nfor it. Thank God! our army, though fatigued, is yet entire. The attack\r\nmade by us yesterday, was under many disadvantages, naturally arising\r\nfrom the uncertainty of knowing which route the enemy would take; and,\r\nfrom that circumstance, the whole of our force could not be brought\r\nup together time enough to engage all at once. Our strength is yet\r\nreserved; and it is evident that Howe does not think himself a gainer by\r\nthe affair, otherwise he would this morning have moved down and attacked\r\nGeneral Washington.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the city and country, it is in your power, by a spirited\r\nimprovement of the present circumstance, to turn it to a real advantage.\r\nHowe is now weaker than before, and every shot will contribute to reduce\r\nhim. You are more immediately interested than any other part of the\r\ncontinent: your all is at stake; it is not so with the general cause;\r\nyou are devoted by the enemy to plunder and destruction: it is the\r\nencouragement which Howe, the chief of plunderers, has promised his\r\narmy. Thus circumstanced, you may save yourselves by a manly resistance,\r\nbut you can have no hope in any other conduct. I never yet knew our\r\nbrave general, or any part of the army, officers or men, out of heart,\r\nand I have seen them in circumstances a thousand times more trying than\r\nthe present. It is only those that are not in action, that feel languor\r\nand heaviness, and the best way to rub it off is to turn out, and make\r\nsure work of it.\r\n\r\nOur army must undoubtedly feel fatigue, and want a reinforcement of rest\r\nthough not of valor. Our own interest and happiness call upon us to\r\ngive them every support in our power, and make the burden of the day, on\r\nwhich the safety of this city depends, as light as possible. Remember,\r\ngentlemen, that we have forces both to the northward and southward of\r\nPhiladelphia, and if the enemy be but stopped till those can arrive,\r\nthis city will be saved, and the enemy finally routed. You have too much\r\nat stake to hesitate. You ought not to think an hour upon the matter,\r\nbut to spring to action at once. Other states have been invaded, have\r\nlikewise driven off the invaders. Now our time and turn is come, and\r\nperhaps the finishing stroke is reserved for us. When we look back on\r\nthe dangers we have been saved from, and reflect on the success we have\r\nbeen blessed with, it would be sinful either to be idle or to despair.\r\n\r\nI close this paper with a short address to General Howe. You, sir, are\r\nonly lingering out the period that shall bring with it your defeat.\r\nYou have yet scarce began upon the war, and the further you enter, the\r\nfaster will your troubles thicken. What you now enjoy is only a respite\r\nfrom ruin; an invitation to destruction; something that will lead on to\r\nour deliverance at your expense. We know the cause which we are engaged\r\nin, and though a passionate fondness for it may make us grieve at every\r\ninjury which threatens it, yet, when the moment of concern is over, the\r\ndetermination to duty returns. We are not moved by the gloomy smile of a\r\nworthless king, but by the ardent glow of generous patriotism. We fight\r\nnot to enslave, but to set a country free, and to make room upon the\r\nearth for honest men to live in. In such a case we are sure that we are\r\nright; and we leave to you the despairing reflection of being the tool\r\nof a miserable tyrant.\r\n\r\n                                           COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 12, 1777.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS. V. TO GEN. SIR WILLIAM HOWE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason,\r\nand whose philosophy consists in holding humanity in contempt, is like\r\nadministering medicine to the dead, or endeavoring to convert an atheist\r\nby scripture. Enjoy, sir, your insensibility of feeling and reflecting.\r\nIt is the prerogative of animals. And no man will envy you these honors,\r\nin which a savage only can be your rival and a bear your master.\r\n\r\nAs the generosity of this country rewarded your brother's services\r\nin the last war, with an elegant monument in Westminster Abbey, it is\r\nconsistent that she should bestow some mark of distinction upon you. You\r\ncertainly deserve her notice, and a conspicuous place in the catalogue\r\nof extraordinary persons. Yet it would be a pity to pass you from the\r\nworld in state, and consign you to magnificent oblivion among the tombs,\r\nwithout telling the future beholder why. Judas is as much known as John,\r\nyet history ascribes their fame to very different actions.\r\n\r\nSir William has undoubtedly merited a monument; but of what kind, or\r\nwith what inscription, where placed or how embellished, is a question\r\nthat would puzzle all the heralds of St. James's in the profoundest mood\r\nof historical deliberation. We are at no loss, sir, to ascertain your\r\nreal character, but somewhat perplexed how to perpetuate its identity,\r\nand preserve it uninjured from the transformations of time or mistake.\r\nA statuary may give a false expression to your bust, or decorate it with\r\nsome equivocal emblems, by which you may happen to steal into reputation\r\nand impose upon the hereafter traditionary world. Ill nature or ridicule\r\nmay conspire, or a variety of accidents combine to lessen, enlarge, or\r\nchange Sir William's fame; and no doubt but he who has taken so much\r\npains to be singular in his conduct, would choose to be just as singular\r\nin his exit, his monument and his epitaph.\r\n\r\nThe usual honors of the dead, to be sure, are not sufficiently sublime\r\nto escort a character like you to the republic of dust and ashes; for\r\nhowever men may differ in their ideas of grandeur or of government here,\r\nthe grave is nevertheless a perfect republic. Death is not the monarch\r\nof the dead, but of the dying. The moment he obtains a conquest he loses\r\na subject, and, like the foolish king you serve, will, in the end, war\r\nhimself out of all his dominions.\r\n\r\nAs a proper preliminary towards the arrangement of your funeral honors,\r\nwe readily admit of your new rank of knighthood. The title is perfectly\r\nin character, and is your own, more by merit than creation. There are\r\nknights of various orders, from the knight of the windmill to the knight\r\nof the post. The former is your patron for exploits, and the latter will\r\nassist you in settling your accounts. No honorary title could be more\r\nhappily applied! The ingenuity is sublime! And your royal master has\r\ndiscovered more genius in fitting you therewith, than in generating the\r\nmost finished figure for a button, or descanting on the properties of a\r\nbutton mould.\r\n\r\nBut how, sir, shall we dispose of you? The invention of a statuary is\r\nexhausted, and Sir William is yet unprovided with a monument. America is\r\nanxious to bestow her funeral favors upon you, and wishes to do it in\r\na manner that shall distinguish you from all the deceased heroes of the\r\nlast war. The Egyptian method of embalming is not known to the\r\npresent age, and hieroglyphical pageantry hath outlived the science\r\nof deciphering it. Some other method, therefore, must be thought of to\r\nimmortalize the new knight of the windmill and post. Sir William, thanks\r\nto his stars, is not oppressed with very delicate ideas. He has no\r\nambition of being wrapped up and handed about in myrrh, aloes and\r\ncassia. Less expensive odors will suffice; and it fortunately happens\r\nthat the simple genius of America has discovered the art of preserving\r\nbodies, and embellishing them too, with much greater frugality than\r\nthe ancients. In balmage, sir, of humble tar, you will be as secure\r\nas Pharaoh, and in a hieroglyphic of feathers, rival in finery all the\r\nmummies of Egypt.\r\n\r\nAs you have already made your exit from the moral world, and by\r\nnumberless acts both of passionate and deliberate injustice engraved an\r\n\"here lieth\" on your deceased honor, it must be mere affectation in you\r\nto pretend concern at the humors or opinions of mankind respecting you.\r\nWhat remains of you may expire at any time. The sooner the better. For\r\nhe who survives his reputation, lives out of despite of himself, like a\r\nman listening to his own reproach.\r\n\r\nThus entombed and ornamented, I leave you to the inspection of the\r\ncurious, and return to the history of your yet surviving actions. The\r\ncharacter of Sir William has undergone some extraordinary revolutions.\r\nsince his arrival in America. It is now fixed and known; and we\r\nhave nothing to hope from your candor or to fear from your capacity.\r\nIndolence and inability have too large a share in your composition, ever\r\nto suffer you to be anything more than the hero of little villainies and\r\nunfinished adventures. That, which to some persons appeared moderation\r\nin you at first, was not produced by any real virtue of your own, but\r\nby a contrast of passions, dividing and holding you in perpetual\r\nirresolution. One vice will frequently expel another, without the least\r\nmerit in the man; as powers in contrary directions reduce each other to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIt became you to have supported a dignified solemnity of character;\r\nto have shown a superior liberality of soul; to have won respect by an\r\nobstinate perseverance in maintaining order, and to have exhibited on\r\nall occasions such an unchangeable graciousness of conduct, that while\r\nwe beheld in you the resolution of an enemy, we might admire in you the\r\nsincerity of a man. You came to America under the high sounding titles\r\nof commander and commissioner; not only to suppress what you call\r\nrebellion, by arms, but to shame it out of countenance by the excellence\r\nof your example. Instead of which, you have been the patron of low and\r\nvulgar frauds, the encourager of Indian cruelties; and have imported a\r\ncargo of vices blacker than those which you pretend to suppress.\r\n\r\nMankind are not universally agreed in their determination of right and\r\nwrong; but there are certain actions which the consent of all nations\r\nand individuals has branded with the unchangeable name of meanness. In\r\nthe list of human vices we find some of such a refined constitution,\r\nthey cannot be carried into practice without seducing some virtue to\r\ntheir assistance; but meanness has neither alliance nor apology. It is\r\ngenerated in the dust and sweepings of other vices, and is of such a\r\nhateful figure that all the rest conspire to disown it. Sir William, the\r\ncommissioner of George the Third, has at last vouchsafed to give it\r\nrank and pedigree. He has placed the fugitive at the council board, and\r\ndubbed it companion of the order of knighthood.\r\n\r\nThe particular act of meanness which I allude to in this description, is\r\nforgery. You, sir, have abetted and patronized the forging and uttering\r\ncounterfeit continental bills. In the same New York newspapers in which\r\nyour own proclamation under your master's authority was published,\r\noffering, or pretending to offer, pardon and protection to these states,\r\nthere were repeated advertisements of counterfeit money for sale, and\r\npersons who have come officially from you, and under the sanction of\r\nyour flag, have been taken up in attempting to put them off.\r\n\r\nA conduct so basely mean in a public character is without precedent or\r\npretence. Every nation on earth, whether friends or enemies, will unite\r\nin despising you. 'Tis an incendiary war upon society, which nothing can\r\nexcuse or palliate,--an improvement upon beggarly villany--and shows an\r\ninbred wretchedness of heart made up between the venomous malignity of a\r\nserpent and the spiteful imbecility of an inferior reptile.\r\n\r\nThe laws of any civilized country would condemn you to the gibbet\r\nwithout regard to your rank or titles, because it is an action foreign\r\nto the usage and custom of war; and should you fall into our hands,\r\nwhich pray God you may, it will be a doubtful matter whether we are to\r\nconsider you as a military prisoner or a prisoner for felony.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is exceedingly unwise and impolitic in you, or any other\r\npersons in the English service, to promote or even encourage, or wink\r\nat the crime of forgery, in any case whatever. Because, as the riches of\r\nEngland, as a nation, are chiefly in paper, and the far greater part of\r\ntrade among individuals is carried on by the same medium, that is, by\r\nnotes and drafts on one another, they, therefore, of all people in the\r\nworld, ought to endeavor to keep forgery out of sight, and, if possible,\r\nnot to revive the idea of it. It is dangerous to make men familiar with\r\na crime which they may afterwards practise to much greater advantage\r\nagainst those who first taught them. Several officers in the English\r\narmy have made their exit at the gallows for forgery on their agents;\r\nfor we all know, who know any thing of England, that there is not a more\r\nnecessitous body of men, taking them generally, than what the English\r\nofficers are. They contrive to make a show at the expense of the\r\ntailors, and appear clean at the charge of the washer-women.\r\n\r\nEngland, has at this time, nearly two hundred million pounds sterling\r\nof public money in paper, for which she has no real property: besides a\r\nlarge circulation of bank notes, bank post bills, and promissory notes\r\nand drafts of private bankers, merchants and tradesmen. She has the\r\ngreatest quantity of paper currency and the least quantity of gold and\r\nsilver of any nation in Europe; the real specie, which is about sixteen\r\nmillions sterling, serves only as change in large sums, which are always\r\nmade in paper, or for payment in small ones. Thus circumstanced, the\r\nnation is put to its wit's end, and obliged to be severe almost to\r\ncriminality, to prevent the practice and growth of forgery. Scarcely\r\na session passes at the Old Bailey, or an execution at Tyburn, but\r\nwitnesses this truth, yet you, sir, regardless of the policy which her\r\nnecessity obliges her to adopt, have made your whole army intimate with\r\nthe crime. And as all armies at the conclusion of a war, are too apt to\r\ncarry into practice the vices of the campaign, it will probably happen,\r\nthat England will hereafter abound in forgeries, to which art the\r\npractitioners were first initiated under your authority in America. You,\r\nsir, have the honor of adding a new vice to the military catalogue; and\r\nthe reason, perhaps, why the invention was reserved for you, is, because\r\nno general before was mean enough even to think of it.\r\n\r\nThat a man whose soul is absorbed in the low traffic of vulgar vice, is\r\nincapable of moving in any superior region, is clearly shown in you by\r\nthe event of every campaign. Your military exploits have been without\r\nplan, object or decision. Can it be possible that you or your employers\r\nsuppose that the possession of Philadelphia will be any ways equal\r\nto the expense or expectation of the nation which supports you? What\r\nadvantages does England derive from any achievements of yours? To her it\r\nis perfectly indifferent what place you are in, so long as the business\r\nof conquest is unperformed and the charge of maintaining you remains the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nIf the principal events of the three campaigns be attended to, the\r\nbalance will appear against you at the close of each; but the last, in\r\npoint of importance to us, has exceeded the former two. It is pleasant\r\nto look back on dangers past, and equally as pleasant to meditate on\r\npresent ones when the way out begins to appear. That period is now\r\narrived, and the long doubtful winter of war is changing to the sweeter\r\nprospects of victory and joy. At the close of the campaign, in 1775, you\r\nwere obliged to retreat from Boston. In the summer of 1776, you appeared\r\nwith a numerous fleet and army in the harbor of New York. By what\r\nmiracle the continent was preserved in that season of danger is a\r\nsubject of admiration! If instead of wasting your time against Long\r\nIsland you had run up the North River, and landed any where above\r\nNew York, the consequence must have been, that either you would have\r\ncompelled General Washington to fight you with very unequal numbers, or\r\nhe must have suddenly evacuated the city with the loss of nearly all\r\nthe stores of his army, or have surrendered for want of provisions; the\r\nsituation of the place naturally producing one or the other of these\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe preparations made to defend New York were, nevertheless, wise and\r\nmilitary; because your forces were then at sea, their numbers uncertain;\r\nstorms, sickness, or a variety of accidents might have disabled their\r\ncoming, or so diminished them on their passage, that those which\r\nsurvived would have been incapable of opening the campaign with\r\nany prospect of success; in which case the defence would have been\r\nsufficient and the place preserved; for cities that have been raised\r\nfrom nothing with an infinitude of labor and expense, are not to be\r\nthrown away on the bare probability of their being taken. On these\r\ngrounds the preparations made to maintain New York were as judicious\r\nas the retreat afterwards. While you, in the interim, let slip the very\r\nopportunity which seemed to put conquest in your power.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole of that campaign you had nearly double the forces\r\nwhich General Washington immediately commanded. The principal plan at\r\nthat time, on our part, was to wear away the season with as little loss\r\nas possible, and to raise the army for the next year. Long Island, New\r\nYork, Forts Washington and Lee were not defended after your superior\r\nforce was known under any expectation of their being finally maintained,\r\nbut as a range of outworks, in the attacking of which your time might be\r\nwasted, your numbers reduced, and your vanity amused by possessing them\r\non our retreat. It was intended to have withdrawn the garrison from Fort\r\nWashington after it had answered the former of those purposes, but\r\nthe fate of that day put a prize into your hands without much honor to\r\nyourselves.\r\n\r\nYour progress through the Jerseys was accidental; you had it not even\r\nin contemplation, or you would not have sent a principal part of your\r\nforces to Rhode Island beforehand. The utmost hope of America in the\r\nyear 1776, reached no higher than that she might not then be conquered.\r\nShe had no expectation of defeating you in that campaign. Even the\r\nmost cowardly Tory allowed, that, could she withstand the shock of that\r\nsummer, her independence would be past a doubt. You had then greatly\r\nthe advantage of her. You were formidable. Your military knowledge\r\nwas supposed to be complete. Your fleets and forces arrived without an\r\naccident. You had neither experience nor reinforcements to wait for.\r\nYou had nothing to do but to begin, and your chance lay in the first\r\nvigorous onset.\r\n\r\nAmerica was young and unskilled. She was obliged to trust her defence to\r\ntime and practice; and has, by mere dint of perseverance, maintained her\r\ncause, and brought the enemy to a condition, in which she is now capable\r\nof meeting him on any grounds.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that in the campaign of 1776 you gained no more,\r\nnotwithstanding your great force, than what was given you by consent of\r\nevacuation, except Fort Washington; while every advantage obtained by\r\nus was by fair and hard fighting. The defeat of Sir Peter Parker was\r\ncomplete. The conquest of the Hessians at Trenton, by the remains of a\r\nretreating army, which but a few days before you affected to despise, is\r\nan instance of their heroic perseverance very seldom to be met with.\r\nAnd the victory over the British troops at Princeton, by a harassed and\r\nwearied party, who had been engaged the day before and marched all night\r\nwithout refreshment, is attended with such a scene of circumstances and\r\nsuperiority of generalship, as will ever give it a place in the first\r\nrank in the history of great actions.\r\n\r\nWhen I look back on the gloomy days of last winter, and see America\r\nsuspended by a thread, I feel a triumph of joy at the recollection of\r\nher delivery, and a reverence for the characters which snatched her\r\nfrom destruction. To doubt now would be a species of infidelity, and to\r\nforget the instruments which saved us then would be ingratitude.\r\n\r\nThe close of that campaign left us with the spirit of conquerors. The\r\nnorthern districts were relieved by the retreat of General Carleton over\r\nthe lakes. The army under your command were hunted back and had their\r\nbounds prescribed. The continent began to feel its military importance,\r\nand the winter passed pleasantly away in preparations for the next\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nHowever confident you might be on your first arrival, the result of the\r\nyear 1776 gave you some idea of the difficulty, if not impossibility of\r\nconquest. To this reason I ascribe your delay in opening the campaign of\r\n1777. The face of matters, on the close of the former year, gave you\r\nno encouragement to pursue a discretionary war as soon as the spring\r\nadmitted the taking the field; for though conquest, in that case, would\r\nhave given you a double portion of fame, yet the experiment was too\r\nhazardous. The ministry, had you failed, would have shifted the whole\r\nblame upon you, charged you with having acted without orders, and\r\ncondemned at once both your plan and execution.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the misfortunes, which might have involved you and your money\r\naccounts in perplexity and suspicion, you prudently waited the arrival\r\nof a plan of operations from England, which was that you should proceed\r\nfor Philadelphia by way of the Chesapeake, and that Burgoyne, after\r\nreducing Ticonderoga, should take his route by Albany, and, if\r\nnecessary, join you.\r\n\r\nThe splendid laurels of the last campaign have flourished in the north.\r\nIn that quarter America has surprised the world, and laid the foundation\r\nof this year's glory. The conquest of Ticonderoga, (if it may be called\r\na conquest) has, like all your other victories, led on to ruin. Even the\r\nprovisions taken in that fortress (which by General Burgoyne's return\r\nwas sufficient in bread and flour for nearly 5000 men for ten weeks, and\r\nin beef and pork for the same number of men for one month) served only\r\nto hasten his overthrow, by enabling him to proceed to Saratoga, the\r\nplace of his destruction. A short review of the operations of the last\r\ncampaign will show the condition of affairs on both sides.\r\n\r\nYou have taken Ticonderoga and marched into Philadelphia. These are all\r\nthe events which the year has produced on your part. A trifling campaign\r\nindeed, compared with the expenses of England and the conquest of the\r\ncontinent. On the other side, a considerable part of your northern force\r\nhas been routed by the New York militia under General Herkemer. Fort\r\nStanwix has bravely survived a compound attack of soldiers and savages,\r\nand the besiegers have fled. The Battle of Bennington has put a thousand\r\nprisoners into our hands, with all their arms, stores, artillery and\r\nbaggage. General Burgoyne, in two engagements, has been defeated;\r\nhimself, his army, and all that were his and theirs are now ours.\r\nTiconderoga and Independence [forts] are retaken, and not the shadow of\r\nan enemy remains in all the northern districts. At this instant we\r\nhave upwards of eleven thousand prisoners, between sixty and seventy\r\n[captured] pieces of brass ordnance, besides small arms, tents, stores,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn order to know the real value of those advantages, we must reverse\r\nthe scene, and suppose General Gates and the force he commanded to be at\r\nyour mercy as prisoners, and General Burgoyne, with his army of soldiers\r\nand savages, to be already joined to you in Pennsylvania. So dismal a\r\npicture can scarcely be looked at. It has all the tracings and colorings\r\nof horror and despair; and excites the most swelling emotions of\r\ngratitude by exhibiting the miseries we are so graciously preserved\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nI admire the distribution of laurels around the continent. It is the\r\nearnest of future union. South Carolina has had her day of sufferings\r\nand of fame; and the other southern States have exerted themselves in\r\nproportion to the force that invaded or insulted them. Towards the close\r\nof the campaign, in 1776, these middle States were called upon and did\r\ntheir duty nobly. They were witnesses to the almost expiring flame of\r\nhuman freedom. It was the close struggle of life and death, the line of\r\ninvisible division; and on which the unabated fortitude of a Washington\r\nprevailed, and saved the spark that has since blazed in the north with\r\nunrivalled lustre.\r\n\r\nLet me ask, sir, what great exploits have you performed? Through all the\r\nvariety of changes and opportunities which the war has produced, I know\r\nno one action of yours that can be styled masterly. You have moved in\r\nand out, backward and forward, round and round, as if valor consisted in\r\na military jig. The history and figure of your movements would be truly\r\nridiculous could they be justly delineated. They resemble the labors of\r\na puppy pursuing his tail; the end is still at the same distance, and\r\nall the turnings round must be done over again.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of affairs at Ticonderoga wore such an unpromising\r\naspect, that it was necessary, in July, to detach a part of the forces\r\nto the support of that quarter, which were otherwise destined or\r\nintended to act against you; and this, perhaps, has been the means of\r\npostponing your downfall to another campaign. The destruction of one\r\narmy at a time is work enough. We know, sir, what we are about, what we\r\nhave to do, and how to do it.\r\n\r\nYour progress from the Chesapeake, was marked by no capital stroke of\r\npolicy or heroism. Your principal aim was to get General Washington\r\nbetween the Delaware and Schuylkill, and between Philadelphia and your\r\narmy. In that situation, with a river on each of his flanks, which\r\nunited about five miles below the city, and your army above him, you\r\ncould have intercepted his reinforcements and supplies, cut off all\r\nhis communication with the country, and, if necessary, have despatched\r\nassistance to open a passage for General Burgoyne. This scheme was too\r\nvisible to succeed: for had General Washington suffered you to command\r\nthe open country above him, I think it a very reasonable conjecture that\r\nthe conquest of Burgoyne would not have taken place, because you could,\r\nin that case, have relieved him. It was therefore necessary, while that\r\nimportant victory was in suspense, to trepan you into a situation in\r\nwhich you could only be on the defensive, without the power of\r\naffording him assistance. The manoeuvre had its effect, and Burgoyne was\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nThere has been something unmilitary and passive in you from the time of\r\nyour passing the Schuylkill and getting possession of Philadelphia,\r\nto the close of the campaign. You mistook a trap for a conquest, the\r\nprobability of which had been made known to Europe, and the edge of your\r\ntriumph taken off by our own information long before.\r\n\r\nHaving got you into this situation, a scheme for a general attack upon\r\nyou at Germantown was carried into execution on the 4th of October, and\r\nthough the success was not equal to the excellence of the plan, yet the\r\nattempting it proved the genius of America to be on the rise, and her\r\npower approaching to superiority. The obscurity of the morning was your\r\nbest friend, for a fog is always favorable to a hunted enemy. Some weeks\r\nafter this you likewise planned an attack on General Washington while\r\nat Whitemarsh. You marched out with infinite parade, but on finding him\r\npreparing to attack you next morning, you prudently turned about, and\r\nretreated to Philadelphia with all the precipitation of a man conquered\r\nin imagination.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the battle of Germantown, the probability of\r\nBurgoyne's defeat gave a new policy to affairs in Pennsylvania, and it\r\nwas judged most consistent with the general safety of America, to wait\r\nthe issue of the northern campaign. Slow and sure is sound work. The\r\nnews of that victory arrived in our camp on the 18th of October, and\r\nno sooner did that shout of joy, and the report of the thirteen cannon\r\nreach your ears, than you resolved upon a retreat, and the next day,\r\nthat is, on the 19th, you withdrew your drooping army into Philadelphia.\r\nThis movement was evidently dictated by fear; and carried with it a\r\npositive confession that you dreaded a second attack. It was hiding\r\nyourself among women and children, and sleeping away the choicest part\r\nof the campaign in expensive inactivity. An army in a city can never\r\nbe a conquering army. The situation admits only of defence. It is mere\r\nshelter: and every military power in Europe will conclude you to be\r\neventually defeated.\r\n\r\nThe time when you made this retreat was the very time you ought to have\r\nfought a battle, in order to put yourself in condition of recovering in\r\nPennsylvania what you had lost in Saratoga. And the reason why you did\r\nnot, must be either prudence or cowardice; the former supposes your\r\ninability, and the latter needs no explanation. I draw no conclusions,\r\nsir, but such as are naturally deduced from known and visible facts,\r\nand such as will always have a being while the facts which produced them\r\nremain unaltered.\r\n\r\nAfter this retreat a new difficulty arose which exhibited the power of\r\nBritain in a very contemptible light; which was the attack and defence\r\nof Mud Island. For several weeks did that little unfinished fortress\r\nstand out against all the attempts of Admiral and General Howe. It was\r\nthe fable of Bender realized on the Delaware. Scheme after scheme, and\r\nforce upon force were tried and defeated. The garrison, with scarce\r\nanything to cover them but their bravery, survived in the midst of mud,\r\nshot and shells, and were at last obliged to give it up more to the\r\npowers of time and gunpowder than to military superiority of the\r\nbesiegers.\r\n\r\nIt is my sincere opinion that matters are in much worse condition with\r\nyou than what is generally known. Your master's speech at the opening of\r\nParliament, is like a soliloquy on ill luck. It shows him to be coming\r\na little to his reason, for sense of pain is the first symptom of\r\nrecovery, in profound stupefaction. His condition is deplorable. He is\r\nobliged to submit to all the insults of France and Spain, without daring\r\nto know or resent them; and thankful for the most trivial evasions to\r\nthe most humble remonstrances. The time was when he could not deign an\r\nanswer to a petition from America, and the time now is when he dare not\r\ngive an answer to an affront from France. The capture of Burgoyne's army\r\nwill sink his consequence as much in Europe as in America. In his speech\r\nhe expresses his suspicions at the warlike preparations of France and\r\nSpain, and as he has only the one army which you command to support his\r\ncharacter in the world with, it remains very uncertain when, or in what\r\nquarter it will be most wanted, or can be best employed; and this will\r\npartly account for the great care you take to keep it from action and\r\nattacks, for should Burgoyne's fate be yours, which it probably will,\r\nEngland may take her endless farewell not only of all America but of all\r\nthe West Indies.\r\n\r\nNever did a nation invite destruction upon itself with the eagerness and\r\nthe ignorance with which Britain has done. Bent upon the ruin of a\r\nyoung and unoffending country, she has drawn the sword that has wounded\r\nherself to the heart, and in the agony of her resentment has applied a\r\npoison for a cure. Her conduct towards America is a compound of rage and\r\nlunacy; she aims at the government of it, yet preserves neither dignity\r\nnor character in her methods to obtain it. Were government a mere\r\nmanufacture or article of commerce, immaterial by whom it should be made\r\nor sold, we might as well employ her as another, but when we consider\r\nit as the fountain from whence the general manners and morality of a\r\ncountry take their rise, that the persons entrusted with the execution\r\nthereof are by their serious example an authority to support these\r\nprinciples, how abominably absurd is the idea of being hereafter\r\ngoverned by a set of men who have been guilty of forgery, perjury,\r\ntreachery, theft and every species of villany which the lowest wretches\r\non earth could practise or invent. What greater public curse can befall\r\nany country than to be under such authority, and what greater blessing\r\nthan to be delivered therefrom. The soul of any man of sentiment would\r\nrise in brave rebellion against them, and spurn them from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe malignant and venomous tempered General Vaughan has amused his\r\nsavage fancy in burning the whole town of Kingston, in York government,\r\nand the late governor of that state, Mr. Tryon, in his letter to General\r\nParsons, has endeavored to justify it and declared his wish to burn the\r\nhouses of every committeeman in the country. Such a confession from\r\none who was once intrusted with the powers of civil government, is a\r\nreproach to the character. But it is the wish and the declaration of a\r\nman whom anguish and disappointment have driven to despair, and who is\r\ndaily decaying into the grave with constitutional rottenness.\r\n\r\nThere is not in the compass of language a sufficiency of words to\r\nexpress the baseness of your king, his ministry and his army. They\r\nhave refined upon villany till it wants a name. To the fiercer vices of\r\nformer ages they have added the dregs and scummings of the most finished\r\nrascality, and are so completely sunk in serpentine deceit, that there\r\nis not left among them one generous enemy.\r\n\r\nFrom such men and such masters, may the gracious hand of Heaven preserve\r\nAmerica! And though the sufferings she now endures are heavy, and\r\nsevere, they are like straws in the wind compared to the weight of evils\r\nshe would feel under the government of your king, and his pensioned\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThere is something in meanness which excites a species of resentment\r\nthat never subsides, and something in cruelty which stirs up the heart\r\nto the highest agony of human hatred; Britain has filled up both these\r\ncharacters till no addition can be made, and has not reputation left\r\nwith us to obtain credit for the slightest promise. The will of God has\r\nparted us, and the deed is registered for eternity. When she shall be\r\na spot scarcely visible among the nations, America shall flourish the\r\nfavorite of heaven, and the friend of mankind.\r\n\r\nFor the domestic happiness of Britain and the peace of the world, I\r\nwish she had not a foot of land but what is circumscribed within her own\r\nisland. Extent of dominion has been her ruin, and instead of civilizing\r\nothers has brutalized herself. Her late reduction of India, under Clive\r\nand his successors, was not so properly a conquest as an extermination\r\nof mankind. She is the only power who could practise the prodigal\r\nbarbarity of tying men to mouths of loaded cannon and blowing them away.\r\nIt happens that General Burgoyne, who made the report of that horrid\r\ntransaction, in the House of Commons, is now a prisoner with us,\r\nand though an enemy, I can appeal to him for the truth of it, being\r\nconfident that he neither can nor will deny it. Yet Clive received the\r\napprobation of the last Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhen we take a survey of mankind, we cannot help cursing the wretch,\r\nwho, to the unavoidable misfortunes of nature, shall wilfully add the\r\ncalamities of war. One would think there were evils enough in the world\r\nwithout studying to increase them, and that life is sufficiently short\r\nwithout shaking the sand that measures it. The histories of Alexander,\r\nand Charles of Sweden, are the histories of human devils; a good man\r\ncannot think of their actions without abhorrence, nor of their deaths\r\nwithout rejoicing. To see the bounties of heaven destroyed, the\r\nbeautiful face of nature laid waste, and the choicest works of creation\r\nand art tumbled into ruin, would fetch a curse from the soul of piety\r\nitself. But in this country the aggravation is heightened by a new\r\ncombination of affecting circumstances. America was young, and, compared\r\nwith other countries, was virtuous. None but a Herod of uncommon malice\r\nwould have made war upon infancy and innocence: and none but a people\r\nof the most finished fortitude, dared under those circumstances, have\r\nresisted the tyranny. The natives, or their ancestors, had fled from the\r\nformer oppressions of England, and with the industry of bees had changed\r\na wilderness into a habitable world. To Britain they were indebted for\r\nnothing. The country was the gift of heaven, and God alone is their Lord\r\nand Sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe time, sir, will come when you, in a melancholy hour, shall reckon up\r\nyour miseries by your murders in America. Life, with you, begins to wear\r\na clouded aspect. The vision of pleasurable delusion is wearing away,\r\nand changing to the barren wild of age and sorrow. The poor reflection\r\nof having served your king will yield you no consolation in your\r\nparting moments. He will crumble to the same undistinguished ashes with\r\nyourself, and have sins enough of his own to answer for. It is not the\r\nfarcical benedictions of a bishop, nor the cringing hypocrisy of a court\r\nof chaplains, nor the formality of an act of Parliament, that can change\r\nguilt into innocence, or make the punishment one pang the less. You may,\r\nperhaps, be unwilling to be serious, but this destruction of the goods\r\nof Providence, this havoc of the human race, and this sowing the world\r\nwith mischief, must be accounted for to him who made and governs it.\r\nTo us they are only present sufferings, but to him they are deep\r\nrebellions.\r\n\r\nIf there is a sin superior to every other, it is that of wilful and\r\noffensive war. Most other sins are circumscribed within narrow limits,\r\nthat is, the power of one man cannot give them a very general extension,\r\nand many kinds of sins have only a mental existence from which no\r\ninfection arises; but he who is the author of a war, lets loose the\r\nwhole contagion of hell, and opens a vein that bleeds a nation to death.\r\nWe leave it to England and Indians to boast of these honors; we feel no\r\nthirst for such savage glory; a nobler flame, a purer spirit animates\r\nAmerica. She has taken up the sword of virtuous defence; she has bravely\r\nput herself between Tyranny and Freedom, between a curse and a blessing,\r\ndetermined to expel the one and protect the other.\r\n\r\nIt is the object only of war that makes it honorable. And if there was\r\never a just war since the world began, it is this in which America is\r\nnow engaged. She invaded no land of yours. She hired no mercenaries to\r\nburn your towns, nor Indians to massacre their inhabitants. She\r\nwanted nothing from you, and was indebted for nothing to you: and thus\r\ncircumstanced, her defence is honorable and her prosperity is certain.\r\n\r\nYet it is not on the justice only, but likewise on the importance of\r\nthis cause that I ground my seeming enthusiastical confidence of our\r\nsuccess. The vast extension of America makes her of too much value in\r\nthe scale of Providence, to be cast like a pearl before swine, at the\r\nfeet of an European island; and of much less consequence would it be\r\nthat Britain were sunk in the sea than that America should miscarry.\r\nThere has been such a chain of extraordinary events in the discovery of\r\nthis country at first, in the peopling and planting it afterwards, in\r\nthe rearing and nursing it to its present state, and in the protection\r\nof it through the present war, that no man can doubt, but Providence\r\nhas some nobler end to accomplish than the gratification of the petty\r\nelector of Hanover, or the ignorant and insignificant king of Britain.\r\n\r\nAs the blood of the martyrs has been the seed of the Christian church,\r\nso the political persecutions of England will and have already enriched\r\nAmerica with industry, experience, union, and importance. Before the\r\npresent era she was a mere chaos of uncemented colonies, individually\r\nexposed to the ravages of the Indians and the invasion of any power that\r\nBritain should be at war with. She had nothing that she could call her\r\nown. Her felicity depended upon accident. The convulsions of Europe\r\nmight have thrown her from one conqueror to another, till she had been\r\nthe slave of all, and ruined by every one; for until she had spirit\r\nenough to become her own master, there was no knowing to which master\r\nshe should belong. That period, thank God, is past, and she is no longer\r\nthe dependent, disunited colonies of Britain, but the independent and\r\nUnited States of America, knowing no master but heaven and herself. You,\r\nor your king, may call this \"delusion,\" \"rebellion,\" or what name you\r\nplease. To us it is perfectly indifferent. The issue will determine the\r\ncharacter, and time will give it a name as lasting as his own.\r\n\r\nYou have now, sir, tried the fate of three campaigns, and can fully\r\ndeclare to England, that nothing is to be got on your part, but blows\r\nand broken bones, and nothing on hers but waste of trade and credit, and\r\nan increase of poverty and taxes. You are now only where you might have\r\nbeen two years ago, without the loss of a single ship, and yet not a\r\nstep more forward towards the conquest of the continent; because, as I\r\nhave already hinted, \"an army in a city can never be a conquering army.\"\r\nThe full amount of your losses, since the beginning of the war, exceeds\r\ntwenty thousand men, besides millions of treasure, for which you have\r\nnothing in exchange. Our expenses, though great, are circulated within\r\nourselves. Yours is a direct sinking of money, and that from both ends\r\nat once; first, in hiring troops out of the nation, and in paying them\r\nafterwards, because the money in neither case can return to Britain. We\r\nare already in possession of the prize, you only in pursuit of it. To\r\nus it is a real treasure, to you it would be only an empty triumph. Our\r\nexpenses will repay themselves with tenfold interest, while yours entail\r\nupon you everlasting poverty.\r\n\r\nTake a review, sir, of the ground which you have gone over, and let\r\nit teach you policy, if it cannot honesty. You stand but on a very\r\ntottering foundation. A change of the ministry in England may probably\r\nbring your measures into question, and your head to the block. Clive,\r\nwith all his successes, had some difficulty in escaping, and yours being\r\nall a war of losses, will afford you less pretensions, and your enemies\r\nmore grounds for impeachment.\r\n\r\nGo home, sir, and endeavor to save the remains of your ruined country,\r\nby a just representation of the madness of her measures. A few moments,\r\nwell applied, may yet preserve her from political destruction. I am not\r\none of those who wish to see Europe in a flame, because I am persuaded\r\nthat such an event will not shorten the war. The rupture, at present,\r\nis confined between the two powers of America and England. England finds\r\nthat she cannot conquer America, and America has no wish to conquer\r\nEngland. You are fighting for what you can never obtain, and we\r\ndefending what we never mean to part with. A few words, therefore,\r\nsettle the bargain. Let England mind her own business and we will mind\r\nours. Govern yourselves, and we will govern ourselves. You may then\r\ntrade where you please unmolested by us, and we will trade where we\r\nplease unmolested by you; and such articles as we can purchase of each\r\nother better than elsewhere may be mutually done. If it were possible\r\nthat you could carry on the war for twenty years you must still come to\r\nthis point at last, or worse, and the sooner you think of it the better\r\nit will be for you.\r\n\r\nMy official situation enables me to know the repeated insults which\r\nBritain is obliged to put up with from foreign powers, and the wretched\r\nshifts that she is driven to, to gloss them over. Her reduced strength\r\nand exhausted coffers in a three years' war with America, has given a\r\npowerful superiority to France and Spain. She is not now a match\r\nfor them. But if neither councils can prevail on her to think, nor\r\nsufferings awaken her to reason, she must e'en go on, till the honor of\r\nEngland becomes a proverb of contempt, and Europe dub her the Land of\r\nFools.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, with every wish for an honorable peace,\r\n\r\n            Your friend, enemy, and countryman,\r\n\r\n                                       COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TO THE INHABITANTS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWITH all the pleasure with which a man exchanges bad company for good,\r\nI take my leave of Sir William and return to you. It is now nearly three\r\nyears since the tyranny of Britain received its first repulse by the\r\narms of America. A period which has given birth to a new world, and\r\nerected a monument to the folly of the old.\r\n\r\nI cannot help being sometimes surprised at the complimentary references\r\nwhich I have seen and heard made to ancient histories and transactions.\r\nThe wisdom, civil governments, and sense of honor of the states of\r\nGreece and Rome, are frequently held up as objects of excellence and\r\nimitation. Mankind have lived to very little purpose, if, at this period\r\nof the world, they must go two or three thousand years back for lessons\r\nand examples. We do great injustice to ourselves by placing them in such\r\na superior line. We have no just authority for it, neither can we tell\r\nwhy it is that we should suppose ourselves inferior.\r\n\r\nCould the mist of antiquity be cleared away, and men and things be\r\nviewed as they really were, it is more than probable that they would\r\nadmire us, rather than we them. America has surmounted a greater variety\r\nand combination of difficulties, than, I believe, ever fell to the share\r\nof any one people, in the same space of time, and has replenished the\r\nworld with more useful knowledge and sounder maxims of civil government\r\nthan were ever produced in any age before. Had it not been for America,\r\nthere had been no such thing as freedom left throughout the whole\r\nuniverse. England has lost hers in a long chain of right reasoning from\r\nwrong principles, and it is from this country, now, that she must learn\r\nthe resolution to redress herself, and the wisdom how to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThe Grecians and Romans were strongly possessed of the spirit of liberty\r\nbut not the principle, for at the time that they were determined not to\r\nbe slaves themselves, they employed their power to enslave the rest of\r\nmankind. But this distinguished era is blotted by no one misanthropical\r\nvice. In short, if the principle on which the cause is founded, the\r\nuniversal blessings that are to arise from it, the difficulties that\r\naccompanied it, the wisdom with which it has been debated, the fortitude\r\nby which it has been supported, the strength of the power which we had\r\nto oppose, and the condition in which we undertook it, be all taken\r\nin one view, we may justly style it the most virtuous and illustrious\r\nrevolution that ever graced the history of mankind.\r\n\r\nA good opinion of ourselves is exceedingly necessary in private life,\r\nbut absolutely necessary in public life, and of the utmost importance in\r\nsupporting national character. I have no notion of yielding the palm of\r\nthe United States to any Grecians or Romans that were ever born. We\r\nhave equalled the bravest in times of danger, and excelled the wisest in\r\nconstruction of civil governments.\r\n\r\nFrom this agreeable eminence let us take a review of present affairs.\r\nThe spirit of corruption is so inseparably interwoven with British\r\npolitics, that their ministry suppose all mankind are governed by the\r\nsame motives. They have no idea of a people submitting even to temporary\r\ninconvenience from an attachment to rights and privileges. Their plans\r\nof business are calculated by the hour and for the hour, and are uniform\r\nin nothing but the corruption which gives them birth. They never had,\r\nneither have they at this time, any regular plan for the conquest of\r\nAmerica by arms. They know not how to go about it, neither have they\r\npower to effect it if they did know. The thing is not within the compass\r\nof human practicability, for America is too extensive either to be fully\r\nconquered or passively defended. But she may be actively defended by\r\ndefeating or making prisoners of the army that invades her. And this is\r\nthe only system of defence that can be effectual in a large country.\r\n\r\nThere is something in a war carried on by invasion which makes it differ\r\nin circumstances from any other mode of war, because he who conducts it\r\ncannot tell whether the ground he gains be for him, or against him, when\r\nhe first obtains it. In the winter of 1776, General Howe marched with\r\nan air of victory through the Jerseys, the consequence of which was his\r\ndefeat; and General Burgoyne at Saratoga experienced the same fate from\r\nthe same cause. The Spaniards, about two years ago, were defeated by\r\nthe Algerines in the same manner, that is, their first triumphs became\r\na trap in which they were totally routed. And whoever will attend to\r\nthe circumstances and events of a war carried on by invasion, will find,\r\nthat any invader, in order to be finally conquered must first begin to\r\nconquer.\r\n\r\nI confess myself one of those who believe the loss of Philadelphia to\r\nbe attended with more advantages than injuries. The case stood thus:\r\nThe enemy imagined Philadelphia to be of more importance to us than it\r\nreally was; for we all know that it had long ceased to be a port: not a\r\ncargo of goods had been brought into it for near a twelvemonth, nor any\r\nfixed manufactories, nor even ship-building, carried on in it; yet as\r\nthe enemy believed the conquest of it to be practicable, and to that\r\nbelief added the absurd idea that the soul of all America was centred\r\nthere, and would be conquered there, it naturally follows that their\r\npossession of it, by not answering the end proposed, must break up the\r\nplans they had so foolishly gone upon, and either oblige them to form a\r\nnew one, for which their present strength is not sufficient, or to give\r\nover the attempt.\r\n\r\nWe never had so small an army to fight against, nor so fair an\r\nopportunity of final success as now. The death wound is already given.\r\nThe day is ours if we follow it up. The enemy, by his situation, is\r\nwithin our reach, and by his reduced strength is within our power. The\r\nministers of Britain may rage as they please, but our part is to conquer\r\ntheir armies. Let them wrangle and welcome, but let, it not draw our\r\nattention from the one thing needful. Here, in this spot is our own\r\nbusiness to be accomplished, our felicity secured. What we have now to\r\ndo is as clear as light, and the way to do it is as straight as a\r\nline. It needs not to be commented upon, yet, in order to be perfectly\r\nunderstood I will put a case that cannot admit of a mistake.\r\n\r\nHad the armies under Generals Howe and Burgoyne been united, and taken\r\npost at Germantown, and had the northern army under General Gates been\r\njoined to that under General Washington, at Whitemarsh, the consequence\r\nwould have been a general action; and if in that action we had killed\r\nand taken the same number of officers and men, that is, between nine and\r\nten thousand, with the same quantity of artillery, arms, stores, etc.,\r\nas have been taken at the northward, and obliged General Howe with the\r\nremains of his army, that is, with the same number he now commands, to\r\ntake shelter in Philadelphia, we should certainly have thought ourselves\r\nthe greatest heroes in the world; and should, as soon as the season\r\npermitted, have collected together all the force of the continent and\r\nlaid siege to the city, for it requires a much greater force to besiege\r\nan enemy in a town than to defeat him in the field. The case now is just\r\nthe same as if it had been produced by the means I have here supposed.\r\nBetween nine and ten thousand have been killed and taken, all their\r\nstores are in our possession, and General Howe, in consequence of that\r\nvictory, has thrown himself for shelter into Philadelphia. He, or his\r\ntrifling friend Galloway, may form what pretences they please, yet no\r\njust reason can be given for their going into winter quarters so early\r\nas the 19th of October, but their apprehensions of a defeat if they\r\ncontinued out, or their conscious inability of keeping the field with\r\nsafety. I see no advantage which can arise to America by hunting the\r\nenemy from state to state. It is a triumph without a prize, and wholly\r\nunworthy the attention of a people determined to conquer. Neither can\r\nany state promise itself security while the enemy remains in a condition\r\nto transport themselves from one part of the continent to another. Howe,\r\nlikewise, cannot conquer where we have no army to oppose, therefore any\r\nsuch removals in him are mean and cowardly, and reduces Britain to a\r\ncommon pilferer. If he retreats from Philadelphia, he will be despised;\r\nif he stays, he may be shut up and starved out, and the country, if he\r\nadvances into it, may become his Saratoga. He has his choice of evils\r\nand we of opportunities. If he moves early, it is not only a sign but a\r\nproof that he expects no reinforcement, and his delay will prove that he\r\neither waits for the arrival of a plan to go upon, or force to execute\r\nit, or both; in which case our strength will increase more than his,\r\ntherefore in any case we cannot be wrong if we do but proceed.\r\n\r\nThe particular condition of Pennsylvania deserves the attention of all\r\nthe other States. Her military strength must not be estimated by\r\nthe number of inhabitants. Here are men of all nations, characters,\r\nprofessions and interests. Here are the firmest Whigs, surviving,\r\nlike sparks in the ocean, unquenched and uncooled in the midst of\r\ndiscouragement and disaffection. Here are men losing their all with\r\ncheerfulness, and collecting fire and fortitude from the flames of their\r\nown estates. Here are others skulking in secret, many making a market\r\nof the times, and numbers who are changing to Whig or Tory with the\r\ncircumstances of every day.\r\n\r\nIt is by a mere dint of fortitude and perseverance that the Whigs of\r\nthis State have been able to maintain so good a countenance, and do even\r\nwhat they have done. We want help, and the sooner it can arrive the more\r\neffectual it will be. The invaded State, be it which it may, will always\r\nfeel an additional burden upon its back, and be hard set to support its\r\ncivil power with sufficient authority; and this difficulty will rise or\r\nfall, in proportion as the other states throw in their assistance to the\r\ncommon cause.\r\n\r\nThe enemy will most probably make many manoeuvres at the opening of this\r\ncampaign, to amuse and draw off the attention of the several States from\r\nthe one thing needful. We may expect to hear of alarms and pretended\r\nexpeditions to this place and that place, to the southward, the\r\neastward, and the northward, all intended to prevent our forming\r\ninto one formidable body. The less the enemy's strength is, the more\r\nsubtleties of this kind will they make use of. Their existence depends\r\nupon it, because the force of America, when collected, is sufficient\r\nto swallow their present army up. It is therefore our business to make\r\nshort work of it, by bending our whole attention to this one principal\r\npoint, for the instant that the main body under General Howe is\r\ndefeated, all the inferior alarms throughout the continent, like so many\r\nshadows, will follow his downfall.\r\n\r\nThe only way to finish a war with the least possible bloodshed, or\r\nperhaps without any, is to collect an army, against the power of which\r\nthe enemy shall have no chance. By not doing this, we prolong the war,\r\nand double both the calamities and expenses of it. What a rich and happy\r\ncountry would America be, were she, by a vigorous exertion, to reduce\r\nHowe as she has reduced Burgoyne. Her currency would rise to millions\r\nbeyond its present value. Every man would be rich, and every man would\r\nhave it in his power to be happy. And why not do these things? What\r\nis there to hinder? America is her own mistress and can do what she\r\npleases.\r\n\r\nIf we had not at this time a man in the field, we could, nevertheless,\r\nraise an army in a few weeks sufficient to overwhelm all the force\r\nwhich General Howe at present commands. Vigor and determination will do\r\nanything and everything. We began the war with this kind of spirit, why\r\nnot end it with the same? Here, gentlemen, is the enemy. Here is the\r\narmy. The interest, the happiness of all America, is centred in this\r\nhalf ruined spot. Come and help us. Here are laurels, come and share\r\nthem. Here are Tories, come and help us to expel them. Here are Whigs\r\nthat will make you welcome, and enemies that dread your coming.\r\n\r\nThe worst of all policies is that of doing things by halves. Penny-wise\r\nand pound-foolish, has been the ruin of thousands. The present spring,\r\nif rightly improved, will free us from our troubles, and save us\r\nthe expense of millions. We have now only one army to cope with. No\r\nopportunity can be fairer; no prospect more promising. I shall conclude\r\nthis paper with a few outlines of a plan, either for filling up the\r\nbattalions with expedition, or for raising an additional force, for any\r\nlimited time, on any sudden emergency.\r\n\r\nThat in which every man is interested, is every man's duty to support.\r\nAnd any burden which falls equally on all men, and from which every\r\nman is to receive an equal benefit, is consistent with the most perfect\r\nideas of liberty. I would wish to revive something of that virtuous\r\nambition which first called America into the field. Then every man was\r\neager to do his part, and perhaps the principal reason why we have in\r\nany degree fallen therefrom, is because we did not set a right value by\r\nit at first, but left it to blaze out of itself, instead of regulating\r\nand preserving it by just proportions of rest and service.\r\n\r\nSuppose any State whose number of effective inhabitants was 80,000,\r\nshould be required to furnish 3,200 men towards the defence of the\r\ncontinent on any sudden emergency.\r\n\r\n1st, Let the whole number of effective inhabitants be divided into\r\nhundreds; then if each of those hundreds turn out four men, the whole\r\nnumber of 3,200 will be had.\r\n\r\n2d, Let the name of each hundred men be entered in a book, and let four\r\ndollars be collected from each man, with as much more as any of the\r\ngentlemen, whose abilities can afford it, shall please to throw in,\r\nwhich gifts likewise shall be entered against the names of the donors.\r\n\r\n3d, Let the sums so collected be offered as a present, over and above\r\nthe bounty of twenty dollars, to any four who may be inclined to propose\r\nthemselves as volunteers: if more than four offer, the majority of the\r\nsubscribers present shall determine which; if none offer, then four out\r\nof the hundred shall be taken by lot, who shall be entitled to the said\r\nsums, and shall either go, or provide others that will, in the space of\r\nsix days.\r\n\r\n4th, As it will always happen that in the space of ground on which a\r\nhundred men shall live, there will be always a number of persons who, by\r\nage and infirmity, are incapable of doing personal service, and as such\r\npersons are generally possessed of the greatest part of property in any\r\ncountry, their portion of service, therefore, will be to furnish each\r\nman with a blanket, which will make a regimental coat, jacket, and\r\nbreeches, or clothes in lieu thereof, and another for a watch cloak,\r\nand two pair of shoes; for however choice people may be of these things\r\nmatters not in cases of this kind; those who live always in houses can\r\nfind many ways to keep themselves warm, but it is a shame and a sin to\r\nsuffer a soldier in the field to want a blanket while there is one in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nShould the clothing not be wanted, the superannuated or infirm persons\r\npossessing property, may, in lieu thereof, throw in their money\r\nsubscriptions towards increasing the bounty; for though age will\r\nnaturally exempt a person from personal service, it cannot exempt him\r\nfrom his share of the charge, because the men are raised for the defence\r\nof property and liberty jointly.\r\n\r\nThere never was a scheme against which objections might not be raised.\r\nBut this alone is not a sufficient reason for rejection. The only line\r\nto judge truly upon is to draw out and admit all the objections which\r\ncan fairly be made, and place against them all the contrary qualities,\r\nconveniences and advantages, then by striking a balance you come at the\r\ntrue character of any scheme, principle or position.\r\n\r\nThe most material advantages of the plan here proposed are, ease,\r\nexpedition, and cheapness; yet the men so raised get a much larger\r\nbounty than is any where at present given; because all the expenses,\r\nextravagance, and consequent idleness of recruiting are saved or\r\nprevented. The country incurs no new debt nor interest thereon; the\r\nwhole matter being all settled at once and entirely done with. It is\r\na subscription answering all the purposes of a tax, without either the\r\ncharge or trouble of collecting. The men are ready for the field with\r\nthe greatest possible expedition, because it becomes the duty of the\r\ninhabitants themselves, in every part of the country, to find their\r\nproportion of men instead of leaving it to a recruiting sergeant, who,\r\nbe he ever so industrious, cannot know always where to apply.\r\n\r\nI do not propose this as a regular digested plan, neither will the\r\nlimits of this paper admit of any further remarks upon it. I believe it\r\nto be a hint capable of much improvement, and as such submit it to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n                                       COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nLANCASTER, March 21, 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS VI. (TO THE EARL OF CARLISLE AND GENERAL CLINTON)\r\n\r\n\r\n            TO THE EARL OF CARLISLE, GENERAL CLINTON, AND\r\n              WILLIAM EDEN, ESQ., BRITISH COMMISSIONERS\r\n                             AT NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is a dignity in the warm passions of a Whig, which is never to be\r\nfound in the cold malice of a Tory. In the one nature is only heated--in\r\nthe other she is poisoned. The instant the former has it in his power to\r\npunish, he feels a disposition to forgive; but the canine venom of the\r\nlatter knows no relief but revenge. This general distinction will, I\r\nbelieve, apply in all cases, and suits as well the meridian of England\r\nas America.\r\n\r\nAs I presume your last proclamation will undergo the strictures of other\r\npens, I shall confine my remarks to only a few parts thereof. All that\r\nyou have said might have been comprised in half the compass. It is\r\ntedious and unmeaning, and only a repetition of your former follies,\r\nwith here and there an offensive aggravation. Your cargo of pardons will\r\nhave no market. It is unfashionable to look at them--even speculation\r\nis at an end. They have become a perfect drug, and no way calculated for\r\nthe climate.\r\n\r\nIn the course of your proclamation you say, \"The policy as well as the\r\nbenevolence of Great Britain have thus far checked the extremes of war,\r\nwhen they tended to distress a people still considered as their fellow\r\nsubjects, and to desolate a country shortly to become again a source of\r\nmutual advantage.\" What you mean by \"the benevolence of Great Britain\"\r\nis to me inconceivable. To put a plain question; do you consider\r\nyourselves men or devils? For until this point is settled, no\r\ndeterminate sense can be put upon the expression. You have already\r\nequalled and in many cases excelled, the savages of either Indies; and\r\nif you have yet a cruelty in store you must have imported it, unmixed\r\nwith every human material, from the original warehouse of hell.\r\n\r\nTo the interposition of Providence, and her blessings on our endeavors,\r\nand not to British benevolence are we indebted for the short chain that\r\nlimits your ravages. Remember you do not, at this time, command a foot\r\nof land on the continent of America. Staten Island, York Island, a small\r\npart of Long Island, and Rhode Island, circumscribe your power; and even\r\nthose you hold at the expense of the West Indies. To avoid a defeat, or\r\nprevent a desertion of your troops, you have taken up your quarters in\r\nholes and corners of inaccessible security; and in order to conceal what\r\nevery one can perceive, you now endeavor to impose your weakness upon\r\nus for an act of mercy. If you think to succeed by such shadowy devices,\r\nyou are but infants in the political world; you have the A, B, C, of\r\nstratagem yet to learn, and are wholly ignorant of the people you have\r\nto contend with. Like men in a state of intoxication, you forget that\r\nthe rest of the world have eyes, and that the same stupidity which\r\nconceals you from yourselves exposes you to their satire and contempt.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph which I have quoted, stands as an introduction to the\r\nfollowing: \"But when that country [America] professes the unnatural\r\ndesign, not only of estranging herself from us, but of mortgaging\r\nherself and her resources to our enemies, the whole contest is changed:\r\nand the question is how far Great Britain may, by every means in her\r\npower, destroy or render useless, a connection contrived for her ruin,\r\nand the aggrandizement of France. Under such circumstances, the laws\r\nof self-preservation must direct the conduct of Britain, and, if the\r\nBritish colonies are to become an accession to France, will direct her\r\nto render that accession of as little avail as possible to her enemy.\"\r\n\r\nI consider you in this declaration, like madmen biting in the hour of\r\ndeath. It contains likewise a fraudulent meanness; for, in order to\r\njustify a barbarous conclusion, you have advanced a false position. The\r\ntreaty we have formed with France is open, noble, and generous. It is\r\ntrue policy, founded on sound philosophy, and neither a surrender\r\nor mortgage, as you would scandalously insinuate. I have seen every\r\narticle, and speak from positive knowledge. In France, we have found an\r\naffectionate friend and faithful ally; in Britain, we have found nothing\r\nbut tyranny, cruelty, and infidelity.\r\n\r\nBut the happiness is, that the mischief you threaten, is not in your\r\npower to execute; and if it were, the punishment would return upon you\r\nin a ten-fold degree. The humanity of America has hitherto restrained\r\nher from acts of retaliation, and the affection she retains for\r\nmany individuals in England, who have fed, clothed and comforted her\r\nprisoners, has, to the present day, warded off her resentment, and\r\noperated as a screen to the whole. But even these considerations\r\nmust cease, when national objects interfere and oppose them. Repeated\r\naggravations will provoke a retort, and policy justify the measure. We\r\nmean now to take you seriously up upon your own ground and principle,\r\nand as you do, so shall you be done by.\r\n\r\nYou ought to know, gentlemen, that England and Scotland, are far more\r\nexposed to incendiary desolation than America, in her present state, can\r\npossibly be. We occupy a country, with but few towns, and whose riches\r\nconsist in land and annual produce. The two last can suffer but little,\r\nand that only within a very limited compass. In Britain it is otherwise.\r\nHer wealth lies chiefly in cities and large towns, the depositories\r\nof manufactures and fleets of merchantmen. There is not a nobleman's\r\ncountry seat but may be laid in ashes by a single person. Your own\r\nmay probably contribute to the proof: in short, there is no evil which\r\ncannot be returned when you come to incendiary mischief. The ships in\r\nthe Thames, may certainly be as easily set on fire, as the temporary\r\nbridge was a few years ago; yet of that affair no discovery was ever\r\nmade; and the loss you would sustain by such an event, executed at a\r\nproper season, is infinitely greater than any you can inflict. The East\r\nIndia House and the Bank, neither are nor can be secure from this sort\r\nof destruction, and, as Dr. Price justly observes, a fire at the latter\r\nwould bankrupt the nation. It has never been the custom of France and\r\nEngland when at war, to make those havocs on each other, because the\r\nease with which they could retaliate rendered it as impolitic as if each\r\nhad destroyed his own.\r\n\r\nBut think not, gentlemen, that our distance secures you, or our\r\ninvention fails us. We can much easier accomplish such a point than any\r\nnation in Europe. We talk the same language, dress in the same habit,\r\nand appear with the same manners as yourselves. We can pass from\r\none part of England to another unsuspected; many of us are as well\r\nacquainted with the country as you are, and should you impolitically\r\nprovoke us, you will most assuredly lament the effects of it. Mischiefs\r\nof this kind require no army to execute them. The means are obvious, and\r\nthe opportunities unguardable. I hold up a warning to our senses, if you\r\nhave any left, and \"to the unhappy people likewise, whose affairs are\r\ncommitted to you.\"* I call not with the rancor of an enemy, but the\r\nearnestness of a friend, on the deluded people of England, lest, between\r\nyour blunders and theirs, they sink beneath the evils contrived for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * General [Sir H.] Clinton's letter to Congress.\r\n\r\n\"He who lives in a glass house,\" says a Spanish proverb, \"should never\r\nbegin throwing stones.\" This, gentlemen, is exactly your case, and you\r\nmust be the most ignorant of mankind, or suppose us so, not to see on\r\nwhich side the balance of accounts will fall. There are many other modes\r\nof retaliation, which, for several reasons, I choose not to mention. But\r\nbe assured of this, that the instant you put your threat into execution,\r\na counter-blow will follow it. If you openly profess yourselves savages,\r\nit is high time we should treat you as such, and if nothing but distress\r\ncan recover you to reason, to punish will become an office of charity.\r\n\r\nWhile your fleet lay last winter in the Delaware, I offered my service\r\nto the Pennsylvania Navy Board then at Trenton, as one who would make\r\na party with them, or any four or five gentlemen, on an expedition down\r\nthe river to set fire to it, and though it was not then accepted, nor\r\nthe thing personally attempted, it is more than probable that your own\r\nfolly will provoke a much more ruinous act. Say not when mischief is\r\ndone, that you had not warning, and remember that we do not begin it,\r\nbut mean to repay it. Thus much for your savage and impolitic threat.\r\n\r\nIn another part of your proclamation you say, \"But if the honors of\r\na military life are become the object of the Americans, let them seek\r\nthose honors under the banners of their rightful sovereign, and in\r\nfighting the battles of the united British Empire, against our late\r\nmutual and natural enemies.\" Surely! the union of absurdity with madness\r\nwas never marked in more distinguishable lines than these. Your rightful\r\nsovereign, as you call him, may do well enough for you, who dare not\r\ninquire into the humble capacities of the man; but we, who estimate\r\npersons and things by their real worth, cannot suffer our judgments to\r\nbe so imposed upon; and unless it is your wish to see him exposed, it\r\nought to be your endeavor to keep him out of sight. The less you have\r\nto say about him the better. We have done with him, and that ought to\r\nbe answer enough. You have been often told so. Strange! that the answer\r\nmust be so often repeated. You go a-begging with your king as with a\r\nbrat, or with some unsaleable commodity you were tired of; and though\r\nevery body tells you no, no, still you keep hawking him about. But\r\nthere is one that will have him in a little time, and as we have no\r\ninclination to disappoint you of a customer, we bid nothing for him.\r\n\r\nThe impertinent folly of the paragraph that I have just quoted, deserves\r\nno other notice than to be laughed at and thrown by, but the principle\r\non which it is founded is detestable. We are invited to submit to a man\r\nwho has attempted by every cruelty to destroy us, and to join him in\r\nmaking war against France, who is already at war against him for our\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nCan Bedlam, in concert with Lucifer, form a more mad and devilish\r\nrequest? Were it possible a people could sink into such apostacy they\r\nwould deserve to be swept from the earth like the inhabitants of Sodom\r\nand Gomorrah. The proposition is an universal affront to the rank which\r\nman holds in the creation, and an indignity to him who placed him\r\nthere. It supposes him made up without a spark of honor, and under no\r\nobligation to God or man.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of men or Christians must you suppose the Americans to be,\r\nwho, after seeing their most humble petitions insultingly rejected;\r\nthe most grievous laws passed to distress them in every quarter; an\r\nundeclared war let loose upon them, and Indians and negroes invited to\r\nthe slaughter; who, after seeing their kinsmen murdered, their fellow\r\ncitizens starved to death in prisons, and their houses and property\r\ndestroyed and burned; who, after the most serious appeals to heaven, the\r\nmost solemn abjuration by oath of all government connected with you, and\r\nthe most heart-felt pledges and protestations of faith to each other;\r\nand who, after soliciting the friendship, and entering into alliances\r\nwith other nations, should at last break through all these obligations,\r\ncivil and divine, by complying with your horrid and infernal proposal.\r\nOught we ever after to be considered as a part of the human race? Or\r\nought we not rather to be blotted from the society of mankind, and\r\nbecome a spectacle of misery to the world? But there is something in\r\ncorruption, which, like a jaundiced eye, transfers the color of itself\r\nto the object it looks upon, and sees every thing stained and impure;\r\nfor unless you were capable of such conduct yourselves, you would never\r\nhave supposed such a character in us. The offer fixes your infamy. It\r\nexhibits you as a nation without faith; with whom oaths and treaties\r\nare considered as trifles, and the breaking them as the breaking of a\r\nbubble. Regard to decency, or to rank, might have taught you better; or\r\npride inspired you, though virtue could not. There is not left a step in\r\nthe degradation of character to which you can now descend; you have put\r\nyour foot on the ground floor, and the key of the dungeon is turned upon\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThat the invitation may want nothing of being a complete monster,\r\nyou have thought proper to finish it with an assertion which has no\r\nfoundation, either in fact or philosophy; and as Mr. Ferguson, your\r\nsecretary, is a man of letters, and has made civil society his study,\r\nand published a treatise on that subject, I address this part to him.\r\n\r\nIn the close of the paragraph which I last quoted, France is styled the\r\n\"natural enemy\" of England, and by way of lugging us into some strange\r\nidea, she is styled \"the late mutual and natural enemy\" of both\r\ncountries. I deny that she ever was the natural enemy of either; and\r\nthat there does not exist in nature such a principle. The expression\r\nis an unmeaning barbarism, and wholly unphilosophical, when applied to\r\nbeings of the same species, let their station in the creation be what\r\nit may. We have a perfect idea of a natural enemy when we think of the\r\ndevil, because the enmity is perpetual, unalterable and unabateable. It\r\nadmits, neither of peace, truce, or treaty; consequently the warfare is\r\neternal, and therefore it is natural. But man with man cannot arrange\r\nin the same opposition. Their quarrels are accidental and equivocally\r\ncreated. They become friends or enemies as the change of temper, or the\r\ncast of interest inclines them. The Creator of man did not constitute\r\nthem the natural enemy of each other. He has not made any one order of\r\nbeings so. Even wolves may quarrel, still they herd together. If any two\r\nnations are so, then must all nations be so, otherwise it is not nature\r\nbut custom, and the offence frequently originates with the accuser.\r\nEngland is as truly the natural enemy of France, as France is of\r\nEngland, and perhaps more so. Separated from the rest of Europe, she\r\nhas contracted an unsocial habit of manners, and imagines in others the\r\njealousy she creates in herself. Never long satisfied with peace,\r\nshe supposes the discontent universal, and buoyed up with her own\r\nimportance, conceives herself the only object pointed at. The expression\r\nhas been often used, and always with a fraudulent design; for when the\r\nidea of a natural enemy is conceived, it prevents all other inquiries,\r\nand the real cause of the quarrel is hidden in the universality of the\r\nconceit. Men start at the notion of a natural enemy, and ask no other\r\nquestion. The cry obtains credit like the alarm of a mad dog, and is\r\none of those kind of tricks, which, by operating on the common passions,\r\nsecures their interest through their folly.\r\n\r\nBut we, sir, are not to be thus imposed upon. We live in a large world,\r\nand have extended our ideas beyond the limits and prejudices of an\r\nisland. We hold out the right hand of friendship to all the universe,\r\nand we conceive that there is a sociality in the manners of France,\r\nwhich is much better disposed to peace and negotiation than that of\r\nEngland, and until the latter becomes more civilized, she cannot expect\r\nto live long at peace with any power. Her common language is vulgar\r\nand offensive, and children suck in with their milk the rudiments of\r\ninsult--\"The arm of Britain! The mighty arm of Britain! Britain that\r\nshakes the earth to its center and its poles! The scourge of France! The\r\nterror of the world! That governs with a nod, and pours down vengeance\r\nlike a God.\" This language neither makes a nation great or little; but\r\nit shows a savageness of manners, and has a tendency to keep national\r\nanimosity alive. The entertainments of the stage are calculated to the\r\nsame end, and almost every public exhibition is tinctured with insult.\r\nYet England is always in dread of France,--terrified at the apprehension\r\nof an invasion, suspicious of being outwitted in a treaty, and privately\r\ncringing though she is publicly offending. Let her, therefore, reform\r\nher manners and do justice, and she will find the idea of a natural\r\nenemy to be only a phantom of her own imagination.\r\n\r\nLittle did I think, at this period of the war, to see a proclamation\r\nwhich could promise you no one useful purpose whatever, and tend only\r\nto expose you. One would think that you were just awakened from a four\r\nyears' dream, and knew nothing of what had passed in the interval.\r\nIs this a time to be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgotten\r\nsubjects of charters and taxation? Is it worth your while, after every\r\nforce has failed you, to retreat under the shelter of argument and\r\npersuasion? Or can you think that we, with nearly half your army\r\nprisoners, and in alliance with France, are to be begged or threatened\r\ninto submission by a piece of paper? But as commissioners at a hundred\r\npounds sterling a week each, you conceive yourselves bound to do\r\nsomething, and the genius of ill-fortune told you, that you must write.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I have not put pen to paper these several months.\r\nConvinced of our superiority by the issue of every campaign, I was\r\ninclined to hope, that that which all the rest of the world now see,\r\nwould become visible to you, and therefore felt unwilling to ruffle your\r\ntemper by fretting you with repetitions and discoveries. There have been\r\nintervals of hesitation in your conduct, from which it seemed a pity to\r\ndisturb you, and a charity to leave you to yourselves. You have often\r\nstopped, as if you intended to think, but your thoughts have ever been\r\ntoo early or too late.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when Britain disdained to answer, or even hear\r\na petition from America. That time is past and she in her turn is\r\npetitioning our acceptance. We now stand on higher ground, and offer\r\nher peace; and the time will come when she, perhaps in vain, will ask\r\nit from us. The latter case is as probable as the former ever was. She\r\ncannot refuse to acknowledge our independence with greater obstinacy\r\nthan she before refused to repeal her laws; and if America alone could\r\nbring her to the one, united with France she will reduce her to the\r\nother. There is something in obstinacy which differs from every other\r\npassion; whenever it fails it never recovers, but either breaks like\r\niron, or crumbles sulkily away like a fractured arch. Most other\r\npassions have their periods of fatigue and rest; their suffering and\r\ntheir cure; but obstinacy has no resource, and the first wound is\r\nmortal. You have already begun to give it up, and you will, from the\r\nnatural construction of the vice, find yourselves both obliged and\r\ninclined to do so.\r\n\r\nIf you look back you see nothing but loss and disgrace. If you look\r\nforward the same scene continues, and the close is an impenetrable\r\ngloom. You may plan and execute little mischiefs, but are they worth the\r\nexpense they cost you, or will such partial evils have any effect on the\r\ngeneral cause? Your expedition to Egg Harbor, will be felt at a distance\r\nlike an attack upon a hen-roost, and expose you in Europe, with a sort\r\nof childish frenzy. Is it worth while to keep an army to protect you\r\nin writing proclamations, or to get once a year into winter quarters?\r\nPossessing yourselves of towns is not conquest, but convenience, and\r\nin which you will one day or other be trepanned. Your retreat from\r\nPhiladelphia, was only a timely escape, and your next expedition may be\r\nless fortunate.\r\n\r\nIt would puzzle all the politicians in the universe to conceive what you\r\nstay for, or why you should have stayed so long. You are prosecuting\r\na war in which you confess you have neither object nor hope, and that\r\nconquest, could it be effected, would not repay the charges: in the mean\r\nwhile the rest of your affairs are running to ruin, and a European war\r\nkindling against you. In such a situation, there is neither doubt nor\r\ndifficulty; the first rudiments of reason will determine the choice, for\r\nif peace can be procured with more advantages than even a conquest can\r\nbe obtained, he must be an idiot indeed that hesitates.\r\n\r\nBut you are probably buoyed up by a set of wretched mortals, who, having\r\ndeceived themselves, are cringing, with the duplicity of a spaniel, for\r\na little temporary bread. Those men will tell you just what you\r\nplease. It is their interest to amuse, in order to lengthen out their\r\nprotection. They study to keep you amongst them for that very purpose;\r\nand in proportion as you disregard their advice, and grow callous to\r\ntheir complaints, they will stretch into improbability, and season their\r\nflattery the higher. Characters like these are to be found in every\r\ncountry, and every country will despise them.\r\n\r\n                                            COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Oct. 20, 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS VII. TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are stages in the business of serious life in which to amuse is\r\ncruel, but to deceive is to destroy; and it is of little consequence, in\r\nthe conclusion, whether men deceive themselves, or submit, by a kind of\r\nmutual consent, to the impositions of each other. That England has long\r\nbeen under the influence of delusion or mistake, needs no other proof\r\nthan the unexpected and wretched situation that she is now involved in:\r\nand so powerful has been the influence, that no provision was ever made\r\nor thought of against the misfortune, because the possibility of its\r\nhappening was never conceived.\r\n\r\nThe general and successful resistance of America, the conquest of\r\nBurgoyne, and a war in France, were treated in parliament as the dreams\r\nof a discontented opposition, or a distempered imagination. They were\r\nbeheld as objects unworthy of a serious thought, and the bare intimation\r\nof them afforded the ministry a triumph of laughter. Short triumph\r\nindeed! For everything which has been predicted has happened, and all\r\nthat was promised has failed. A long series of politics so remarkably\r\ndistinguished by a succession of misfortunes, without one alleviating\r\nturn, must certainly have something in it systematically wrong. It is\r\nsufficient to awaken the most credulous into suspicion, and the most\r\nobstinate into thought. Either the means in your power are insufficient,\r\nor the measures ill planned; either the execution has been bad, or the\r\nthing attempted impracticable; or, to speak more emphatically, either\r\nyou are not able or heaven is not willing. For, why is it that you have\r\nnot conquered us? Who, or what has prevented you? You have had every\r\nopportunity that you could desire, and succeeded to your utmost wish in\r\nevery preparatory means. Your fleets and armies have arrived in America\r\nwithout an accident. No uncommon fortune has intervened. No foreign\r\nnation has interfered until the time which you had allotted for victory\r\nwas passed. The opposition, either in or out of parliament, neither\r\ndisconcerted your measures, retarded or diminished your force. They only\r\nforetold your fate. Every ministerial scheme was carried with as high a\r\nhand as if the whole nation had been unanimous. Every thing wanted was\r\nasked for, and every thing asked for was granted.\r\n\r\nA greater force was not within the compass of your abilities to send,\r\nand the time you sent it was of all others the most favorable. You were\r\nthen at rest with the whole world beside. You had the range of every\r\ncourt in Europe uncontradicted by us. You amused us with a tale of\r\ncommissioners of peace, and under that disguise collected a numerous\r\narmy and came almost unexpectedly upon us. The force was much greater\r\nthan we looked for; and that which we had to oppose it with, was unequal\r\nin numbers, badly armed, and poorly disciplined; beside which, it was\r\nembodied only for a short time, and expired within a few months after\r\nyour arrival. We had governments to form; measures to concert; an\r\narmy to train, and every necessary article to import or to create. Our\r\nnon-importation scheme had exhausted our stores, and your command by sea\r\nintercepted our supplies. We were a people unknown, and unconnected with\r\nthe political world, and strangers to the disposition of foreign\r\npowers. Could you possibly wish for a more favorable conjunction of\r\ncircumstances? Yet all these have happened and passed away, and, as\r\nit were, left you with a laugh. There are likewise, events of such an\r\noriginal nativity as can never happen again, unless a new world should\r\narise from the ocean.\r\n\r\nIf any thing can be a lesson to presumption, surely the circumstances\r\nof this war will have their effect. Had Britain been defeated by\r\nany European power, her pride would have drawn consolation from the\r\nimportance of her conquerors; but in the present case, she is excelled\r\nby those that she affected to despise, and her own opinions retorting\r\nupon herself, become an aggravation of her disgrace. Misfortune and\r\nexperience are lost upon mankind, when they produce neither reflection\r\nnor reformation. Evils, like poisons, have their uses, and there are\r\ndiseases which no other remedy can reach. It has been the crime and\r\nfolly of England to suppose herself invincible, and that, without\r\nacknowledging or perceiving that a full third of her strength was drawn\r\nfrom the country she is now at war with. The arm of Britain has been\r\nspoken of as the arm of the Almighty, and she has lived of late as if\r\nshe thought the whole world created for her diversion. Her politics,\r\ninstead of civilizing, has tended to brutalize mankind, and under the\r\nvain, unmeaning title of \"Defender of the Faith,\" she has made war like\r\nan Indian against the religion of humanity. Her cruelties in the East\r\nIndies will never be forgotten, and it is somewhat remarkable that the\r\nproduce of that ruined country, transported to America, should there\r\nkindle up a war to punish the destroyer. The chain is continued,\r\nthough with a mysterious kind of uniformity both in the crime and the\r\npunishment. The latter runs parallel with the former, and time and fate\r\nwill give it a perfect illustration.\r\n\r\nWhen information is withheld, ignorance becomes a reasonable excuse; and\r\none would charitably hope that the people of England do not encourage\r\ncruelty from choice but from mistake. Their recluse situation,\r\nsurrounded by the sea, preserves them from the calamities of war, and\r\nkeeps them in the dark as to the conduct of their own armies. They see\r\nnot, therefore they feel not. They tell the tale that is told them and\r\nbelieve it, and accustomed to no other news than their own, they receive\r\nit, stripped of its horrors and prepared for the palate of the nation,\r\nthrough the channel of the London Gazette. They are made to believe that\r\ntheir generals and armies differ from those of other nations, and have\r\nnothing of rudeness or barbarity in them. They suppose them what\r\nthey wish them to be. They feel a disgrace in thinking otherwise, and\r\nnaturally encourage the belief from a partiality to themselves. There\r\nwas a time when I felt the same prejudices, and reasoned from the\r\nsame errors; but experience, sad and painful experience, has taught me\r\nbetter. What the conduct of former armies was, I know not, but what the\r\nconduct of the present is, I well know. It is low, cruel, indolent and\r\nprofligate; and had the people of America no other cause for separation\r\nthan what the army has occasioned, that alone is cause sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe field of politics in England is far more extensive than that of\r\nnews. Men have a right to reason for themselves, and though they cannot\r\ncontradict the intelligence in the London Gazette, they may frame upon\r\nit what sentiments they please. But the misfortune is, that a general\r\nignorance has prevailed over the whole nation respecting America. The\r\nministry and the minority have both been wrong. The former was always\r\nso, the latter only lately so. Politics, to be executively right, must\r\nhave a unity of means and time, and a defect in either overthrows the\r\nwhole. The ministry rejected the plans of the minority while they were\r\npracticable, and joined in them when they became impracticable. From\r\nwrong measures they got into wrong time, and have now completed the\r\ncircle of absurdity by closing it upon themselves.\r\n\r\nI happened to come to America a few months before the breaking out of\r\nhostilities. I found the disposition of the people such, that they might\r\nhave been led by a thread and governed by a reed. Their suspicion was\r\nquick and penetrating, but their attachment to Britain was obstinate,\r\nand it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it. They\r\ndisliked the ministry, but they esteemed the nation. Their idea of\r\ngrievance operated without resentment, and their single object was\r\nreconciliation. Bad as I believed the ministry to be, I never conceived\r\nthem capable of a measure so rash and wicked as the commencing of\r\nhostilities; much less did I imagine the nation would encourage it.\r\nI viewed the dispute as a kind of law-suit, in which I supposed the\r\nparties would find a way either to decide or settle it. I had no\r\nthoughts of independence or of arms. The world could not then have\r\npersuaded me that I should be either a soldier or an author. If I had\r\nany talents for either, they were buried in me, and might ever have\r\ncontinued so, had not the necessity of the times dragged and driven them\r\ninto action. I had formed my plan of life, and conceiving myself happy,\r\nwished every body else so. But when the country, into which I had just\r\nset my foot, was set on fire about my ears, it was time to stir. It\r\nwas time for every man to stir. Those who had been long settled had\r\nsomething to defend; those who had just come had something to pursue;\r\nand the call and the concern was equal and universal. For in a country\r\nwhere all men were once adventurers, the difference of a few years in\r\ntheir arrival could make none in their right.\r\n\r\nThe breaking out of hostilities opened a new suspicion in the politics\r\nof America, which, though at that time very rare, has since been proved\r\nto be very right. What I allude to is, \"a secret and fixed determination\r\nin the British Cabinet to annex America to the crown of England as a\r\nconquered country.\" If this be taken as the object, then the whole\r\nline of conduct pursued by the ministry, though rash in its origin and\r\nruinous in its consequences, is nevertheless uniform and consistent in\r\nits parts. It applies to every case and resolves every difficulty.\r\nBut if taxation, or any thing else, be taken in its room, there is no\r\nproportion between the object and the charge. Nothing but the whole\r\nsoil and property of the country can be placed as a possible equivalent\r\nagainst the millions which the ministry expended. No taxes raised in\r\nAmerica could possibly repay it. A revenue of two millions sterling a\r\nyear would not discharge the sum and interest accumulated thereon, in\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\nReconciliation never appears to have been the wish or the object of the\r\nadministration; they looked on conquest as certain and infallible, and,\r\nunder that persuasion, sought to drive the Americans into what they\r\nmight style a general rebellion, and then, crushing them with arms\r\nin their hands, reap the rich harvest of a general confiscation, and\r\nsilence them for ever. The dependents at court were too numerous to be\r\nprovided for in England. The market for plunder in the East Indies was\r\nover; and the profligacy of government required that a new mine should\r\nbe opened, and that mine could be no other than America, conquered\r\nand forfeited. They had no where else to go. Every other channel was\r\ndrained; and extravagance, with the thirst of a drunkard, was gaping for\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nIf the ministry deny this to have been their plan, it becomes them to\r\nexplain what was their plan. For either they have abused us in coveting\r\nproperty they never labored for, or they have abused you in expending an\r\namazing sum upon an incompetent object. Taxation, as I mentioned before,\r\ncould never be worth the charge of obtaining it by arms; and any kind of\r\nformal obedience which America could have made, would have weighed with\r\nthe lightness of a laugh against such a load of expense. It is therefore\r\nmost probable that the ministry will at last justify their policy by\r\ntheir dishonesty, and openly declare, that their original design was\r\nconquest: and, in this case, it well becomes the people of England to\r\nconsider how far the nation would have been benefited by the success.\r\n\r\nIn a general view, there are few conquests that repay the charge of\r\nmaking them, and mankind are pretty well convinced that it can never be\r\nworth their while to go to war for profit's sake. If they are made war\r\nupon, their country invaded, or their existence at stake, it is their\r\nduty to defend and preserve themselves, but in every other light, and\r\nfrom every other cause, is war inglorious and detestable. But to return\r\nto the case in question--\r\n\r\nWhen conquests are made of foreign countries, it is supposed that the\r\ncommerce and dominion of the country which made them are extended. But\r\nthis could neither be the object nor the consequence of the present\r\nwar. You enjoyed the whole commerce before. It could receive no possible\r\naddition by a conquest, but on the contrary, must diminish as the\r\ninhabitants were reduced in numbers and wealth. You had the same\r\ndominion over the country which you used to have, and had no complaint\r\nto make against her for breach of any part of the contract between\r\nyou or her, or contending against any established custom, commercial,\r\npolitical or territorial. The country and commerce were both your own\r\nwhen you began to conquer, in the same manner and form as they had been\r\nyour own a hundred years before. Nations have sometimes been induced to\r\nmake conquests for the sake of reducing the power of their enemies, or\r\nbringing it to a balance with their own. But this could be no part of\r\nyour plan. No foreign authority was claimed here, neither was any such\r\nauthority suspected by you, or acknowledged or imagined by us. What\r\nthen, in the name of heaven, could you go to war for? Or what chance\r\ncould you possibly have in the event, but either to hold the same\r\ncountry which you held before, and that in a much worse condition, or\r\nto lose, with an amazing expense, what you might have retained without a\r\nfarthing of charges?\r\n\r\nWar never can be the interest of a trading nation, any more than\r\nquarrelling can be profitable to a man in business. But to make war with\r\nthose who trade with us, is like setting a bull-dog upon a customer at\r\nthe shop-door. The least degree of common sense shows the madness of\r\nthe latter, and it will apply with the same force of conviction to the\r\nformer. Piratical nations, having neither commerce or commodities of\r\ntheir own to lose, may make war upon all the world, and lucratively\r\nfind their account in it; but it is quite otherwise with Britain: for,\r\nbesides the stoppage of trade in time of war, she exposes more of her\r\nown property to be lost, than she has the chance of taking from others.\r\nSome ministerial gentlemen in parliament have mentioned the greatness of\r\nher trade as an apology for the greatness of her loss. This is miserable\r\npolitics indeed! Because it ought to have been given as a reason for her\r\nnot engaging in a war at first. The coast of America commands the West\r\nIndia trade almost as effectually as the coast of Africa does that of\r\nthe Straits; and England can no more carry on the former without the\r\nconsent of America, than she can the latter without a Mediterranean\r\npass.\r\n\r\nIn whatever light the war with America is considered upon commercial\r\nprinciples, it is evidently the interest of the people of England not to\r\nsupport it; and why it has been supported so long, against the clearest\r\ndemonstrations of truth and national advantage, is, to me, and must be\r\nto all the reasonable world, a matter of astonishment. Perhaps it may\r\nbe said that I live in America, and write this from interest. To this\r\nI reply, that my principle is universal. My attachment is to all the\r\nworld, and not to any particular part, and if what I advance is right,\r\nno matter where or who it comes from. We have given the proclamation of\r\nyour commissioners a currency in our newspapers, and I have no doubt you\r\nwill give this a place in yours. To oblige and be obliged is fair.\r\n\r\nBefore I dismiss this part of my address, I shall mention one more\r\ncircumstance in which I think the people of England have been equally\r\nmistaken: and then proceed to other matters.\r\n\r\nThere is such an idea existing in the world, as that of national honor,\r\nand this, falsely understood, is oftentimes the cause of war. In a\r\nChristian and philosophical sense, mankind seem to have stood still\r\nat individual civilization, and to retain as nations all the original\r\nrudeness of nature. Peace by treaty is only a cessation of violence for\r\na reformation of sentiment. It is a substitute for a principle that\r\nis wanting and ever will be wanting till the idea of national honor be\r\nrightly understood. As individuals we profess ourselves Christians, but\r\nas nations we are heathens, Romans, and what not. I remember the late\r\nAdmiral Saunders declaring in the House of Commons, and that in the time\r\nof peace, \"That the city of Madrid laid in ashes was not a sufficient\r\natonement for the Spaniards taking off the rudder of an English sloop\r\nof war.\" I do not ask whether this is Christianity or morality, I ask\r\nwhether it is decency? whether it is proper language for a nation to\r\nuse? In private life we call it by the plain name of bullying, and\r\nthe elevation of rank cannot alter its character. It is, I think,\r\nexceedingly easy to define what ought to be understood by national\r\nhonor; for that which is the best character for an individual is the\r\nbest character for a nation; and wherever the latter exceeds or\r\nfalls beneath the former, there is a departure from the line of true\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\nI have thrown out this observation with a design of applying it to Great\r\nBritain. Her ideas of national honor seem devoid of that benevolence of\r\nheart, that universal expansion of philanthropy, and that triumph over\r\nthe rage of vulgar prejudice, without which man is inferior to himself,\r\nand a companion of common animals. To know who she shall regard or\r\ndislike, she asks what country they are of, what religion they profess,\r\nand what property they enjoy. Her idea of national honor seems to\r\nconsist in national insult, and that to be a great people, is to be\r\nneither a Christian, a philosopher, or a gentleman, but to threaten with\r\nthe rudeness of a bear, and to devour with the ferocity of a lion. This\r\nperhaps may sound harsh and uncourtly, but it is too true, and the more\r\nis the pity.\r\n\r\nI mention this only as her general character. But towards America she\r\nhas observed no character at all; and destroyed by her conduct what she\r\nassumed in her title. She set out with the title of parent, or mother\r\ncountry. The association of ideas which naturally accompany this\r\nexpression, are filled with everything that is fond, tender and\r\nforbearing. They have an energy peculiar to themselves, and, overlooking\r\nthe accidental attachment of common affections, apply with infinite\r\nsoftness to the first feelings of the heart. It is a political term\r\nwhich every mother can feel the force of, and every child can judge of.\r\nIt needs no painting of mine to set it off, for nature only can do it\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nBut has any part of your conduct to America corresponded with the title\r\nyou set up? If in your general national character you are unpolished and\r\nsevere, in this you are inconsistent and unnatural, and you must have\r\nexceeding false notions of national honor to suppose that the world can\r\nadmire a want of humanity or that national honor depends on the\r\nviolence of resentment, the inflexibility of temper, or the vengeance of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nI would willingly convince you, and that with as much temper as the\r\ntimes will suffer me to do, that as you opposed your own interest by\r\nquarrelling with us, so likewise your national honor, rightly conceived\r\nand understood, was no ways called upon to enter into a war with\r\nAmerica; had you studied true greatness of heart, the first and fairest\r\nornament of mankind, you would have acted directly contrary to all that\r\nyou have done, and the world would have ascribed it to a generous cause.\r\nBesides which, you had (though with the assistance of this country)\r\nsecured a powerful name by the last war. You were known and dreaded\r\nabroad; and it would have been wise in you to have suffered the world to\r\nhave slept undisturbed under that idea. It was to you a force existing\r\nwithout expense. It produced to you all the advantages of real power;\r\nand you were stronger through the universality of that charm, than any\r\nfuture fleets and armies may probably make you. Your greatness was so\r\nsecured and interwoven with your silence that you ought never to have\r\nawakened mankind, and had nothing to do but to be quiet. Had you been\r\ntrue politicians you would have seen all this, and continued to draw\r\nfrom the magic of a name, the force and authority of a nation.\r\n\r\nUnwise as you were in breaking the charm, you were still more unwise\r\nin the manner of doing it. Samson only told the secret, but you have\r\nperformed the operation; you have shaven your own head, and wantonly\r\nthrown away the locks. America was the hair from which the charm was\r\ndrawn that infatuated the world. You ought to have quarrelled with no\r\npower; but with her upon no account. You had nothing to fear from any\r\ncondescension you might make. You might have humored her, even if there\r\nhad been no justice in her claims, without any risk to your reputation;\r\nfor Europe, fascinated by your fame, would have ascribed it to your\r\nbenevolence, and America, intoxicated by the grant, would have slumbered\r\nin her fetters.\r\n\r\nBut this method of studying the progress of the passions, in order to\r\nascertain the probable conduct of mankind, is a philosophy in politics\r\nwhich those who preside at St. James's have no conception of. They know\r\nno other influence than corruption and reckon all their probabilities\r\nfrom precedent. A new case is to them a new world, and while they are\r\nseeking for a parallel they get lost. The talents of Lord Mansfield can\r\nbe estimated at best no higher than those of a sophist. He understands\r\nthe subtleties but not the elegance of nature; and by continually\r\nviewing mankind through the cold medium of the law, never thinks of\r\npenetrating into the warmer region of the mind. As for Lord North, it\r\nis his happiness to have in him more philosophy than sentiment, for he\r\nbears flogging like a top, and sleeps the better for it. His punishment\r\nbecomes his support, for while he suffers the lash for his sins,\r\nhe keeps himself up by twirling about. In politics, he is a good\r\narithmetician, and in every thing else nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThere is one circumstance which comes so much within Lord North's\r\nprovince as a financier, that I am surprised it should escape him,\r\nwhich is, the different abilities of the two countries in supporting the\r\nexpense; for, strange as it may seem, England is not a match for America\r\nin this particular. By a curious kind of revolution in accounts, the\r\npeople of England seem to mistake their poverty for their riches; that\r\nis, they reckon their national debt as a part of their national wealth.\r\nThey make the same kind of error which a man would do, who after\r\nmortgaging his estate, should add the money borrowed, to the full value\r\nof the estate, in order to count up his worth, and in this case he would\r\nconceive that he got rich by running into debt. Just thus it is with\r\nEngland. The government owed at the beginning of this war one hundred\r\nand thirty-five millions sterling, and though the individuals to whom it\r\nwas due had a right to reckon their shares as so much private property,\r\nyet to the nation collectively it was so much poverty. There are as\r\neffectual limits to public debts as to private ones, for when once the\r\nmoney borrowed is so great as to require the whole yearly revenue to\r\ndischarge the interest thereon, there is an end to further borrowing;\r\nin the same manner as when the interest of a man's debts amounts to\r\nthe yearly income of his estate, there is an end to his credit. This is\r\nnearly the case with England, the interest of her present debt being\r\nat least equal to one half of her yearly revenue, so that out of ten\r\nmillions annually collected by taxes, she has but five that she can call\r\nher own.\r\n\r\nThe very reverse of this was the case with America; she began the war\r\nwithout any debt upon her, and in order to carry it on, she neither\r\nraised money by taxes, nor borrowed it upon interest, but created it;\r\nand her situation at this time continues so much the reverse of yours\r\nthat taxing would make her rich, whereas it would make you poor. When we\r\nshall have sunk the sum which we have created, we shall then be out of\r\ndebt, be just as rich as when we began, and all the while we are doing\r\nit shall feel no difference, because the value will rise as the quantity\r\ndecreases.\r\n\r\nThere was not a country in the world so capable of bearing the expense\r\nof a war as America; not only because she was not in debt when she\r\nbegan, but because the country is young and capable of infinite\r\nimprovement, and has an almost boundless tract of new lands in store;\r\nwhereas England has got to her extent of age and growth, and has not\r\nunoccupied land or property in reserve. The one is like a young heir\r\ncoming to a large improvable estate; the other like an old man whose\r\nchances are over, and his estate mortgaged for half its worth.\r\n\r\nIn the second number of the Crisis, which I find has been republished\r\nin England, I endeavored to set forth the impracticability of conquering\r\nAmerica. I stated every case, that I conceived could possibly happen,\r\nand ventured to predict its consequences. As my conclusions were drawn\r\nnot artfully, but naturally, they have all proved to be true. I was upon\r\nthe spot; knew the politics of America, her strength and resources, and\r\nby a train of services, the best in my power to render, was honored with\r\nthe friendship of the congress, the army and the people. I considered\r\nthe cause a just one. I know and feel it a just one, and under that\r\nconfidence never made my own profit or loss an object. My endeavor was\r\nto have the matter well understood on both sides, and I conceived\r\nmyself tendering a general service, by setting forth to the one the\r\nimpossibility of being conquered, and to the other the impossibility\r\nof conquering. Most of the arguments made use of by the ministry for\r\nsupporting the war, are the very arguments that ought to have been used\r\nagainst supporting it; and the plans, by which they thought to conquer,\r\nare the very plans in which they were sure to be defeated. They have\r\ntaken every thing up at the wrong end. Their ignorance is astonishing,\r\nand were you in my situation you would see it. They may, perhaps,\r\nhave your confidence, but I am persuaded that they would make very\r\nindifferent members of Congress. I know what England is, and what\r\nAmerica is, and from the compound of knowledge, am better enabled to\r\njudge of the issue than what the king or any of his ministers can be.\r\n\r\nIn this number I have endeavored to show the ill policy and\r\ndisadvantages of the war. I believe many of my remarks are new. Those\r\nwhich are not so, I have studied to improve and place in a manner that\r\nmay be clear and striking. Your failure is, I am persuaded, as certain\r\nas fate. America is above your reach. She is at least your equal in the\r\nworld, and her independence neither rests upon your consent, nor can it\r\nbe prevented by your arms. In short, you spend your substance in vain,\r\nand impoverish yourselves without a hope.\r\n\r\nBut suppose you had conquered America, what advantages, collectively or\r\nindividually, as merchants, manufacturers, or conquerors, could you\r\nhave looked for? This is an object you seemed never to have attended to.\r\nListening for the sound of victory, and led away by the frenzy of arms,\r\nyou neglected to reckon either the cost or the consequences. You must\r\nall pay towards the expense; the poorest among you must bear his share,\r\nand it is both your right and your duty to weigh seriously the matter.\r\nHad America been conquered, she might have been parcelled out in grants\r\nto the favorites at court, but no share of it would have fallen to you.\r\nYour taxes would not have been lessened, because she would have been\r\nin no condition to have paid any towards your relief. We are rich by\r\ncontrivance of our own, which would have ceased as soon as you became\r\nmasters. Our paper money will be of no use in England, and silver and\r\ngold we have none. In the last war you made many conquests, but were any\r\nof your taxes lessened thereby? On the contrary, were you not taxed to\r\npay for the charge of making them, and has not the same been the case in\r\nevery war?\r\n\r\nTo the Parliament I wish to address myself in a more particular manner.\r\nThey appear to have supposed themselves partners in the chase, and to\r\nhave hunted with the lion from an expectation of a right in the booty;\r\nbut in this it is most probable they would, as legislators, have\r\nbeen disappointed. The case is quite a new one, and many unforeseen\r\ndifficulties would have arisen thereon. The Parliament claimed a\r\nlegislative right over America, and the war originated from that\r\npretence. But the army is supposed to belong to the crown, and if\r\nAmerica had been conquered through their means, the claim of the\r\nlegislature would have been suffocated in the conquest. Ceded, or\r\nconquered, countries are supposed to be out of the authority of\r\nParliament. Taxation is exercised over them by prerogative and not by\r\nlaw. It was attempted to be done in the Grenadas a few years ago, and\r\nthe only reason why it was not done was because the crown had made a\r\nprior relinquishment of its claim. Therefore, Parliament have been all\r\nthis while supporting measures for the establishment of their authority,\r\nin the issue of which, they would have been triumphed over by the\r\nprerogative. This might have opened a new and interesting opposition\r\nbetween the Parliament and the crown. The crown would have said that it\r\nconquered for itself, and that to conquer for Parliament was an unknown\r\ncase. The Parliament might have replied, that America not being a\r\nforeign country, but a country in rebellion, could not be said to be\r\nconquered, but reduced; and thus continued their claim by disowning\r\nthe term. The crown might have rejoined, that however America might\r\nbe considered at first, she became foreign at last by a declaration of\r\nindependence, and a treaty with France; and that her case being, by that\r\ntreaty, put within the law of nations, was out of the law of Parliament,\r\nwho might have maintained, that as their claim over America had never\r\nbeen surrendered, so neither could it be taken away. The crown might\r\nhave insisted, that though the claim of Parliament could not be taken\r\naway, yet, being an inferior, it might be superseded; and that, whether\r\nthe claim was withdrawn from the object, or the object taken from the\r\nclaim, the same separation ensued; and that America being subdued after\r\na treaty with France, was to all intents and purposes a regal conquest,\r\nand of course the sole property of the king. The Parliament, as the\r\nlegal delegates of the people, might have contended against the term\r\n\"inferior,\" and rested the case upon the antiquity of power, and this\r\nwould have brought on a set of very interesting and rational questions.\r\n\r\n  1st, What is the original fountain of power and honor in any country?\r\n  2d, Whether the prerogative does not belong to the people?\r\n  3d, Whether there is any such thing as the English constitution?\r\n  4th, Of what use is the crown to the people?\r\n  5th, Whether he who invented a crown was not an enemy to mankind?\r\n  6th, Whether it is not a shame for a man to spend a million a year\r\n  and do no good for it, and whether the money might not be better\r\n  applied? 7th, Whether such a man is not better dead than alive?\r\n  8th, Whether a Congress, constituted like that of America, is not the\r\n  most happy and consistent form of government in the world?--With a\r\n  number of others of the same import.\r\n\r\nIn short, the contention about the dividend might have distracted the\r\nnation; for nothing is more common than to agree in the conquest and\r\nquarrel for the prize; therefore it is, perhaps, a happy circumstance,\r\nthat our successes have prevented the dispute.\r\n\r\nIf the Parliament had been thrown out in their claim, which it is most\r\nprobable they would, the nation likewise would have been thrown out in\r\ntheir expectation; for as the taxes would have been laid on by the crown\r\nwithout the Parliament, the revenue arising therefrom, if any could\r\nhave arisen, would not have gone into the exchequer, but into the privy\r\npurse, and so far from lessening the taxes, would not even have been\r\nadded to them, but served only as pocket money to the crown. The more I\r\nreflect on this matter, the more I am satisfied at the blindness and\r\nill policy of my countrymen, whose wisdom seems to operate without\r\ndiscernment, and their strength without an object.\r\n\r\nTo the great bulwark of the nation, I mean the mercantile and\r\nmanufacturing part thereof, I likewise present my address. It is your\r\ninterest to see America an independent, and not a conquered country. If\r\nconquered, she is ruined; and if ruined, poor; consequently the\r\ntrade will be a trifle, and her credit doubtful. If independent, she\r\nflourishes, and from her flourishing must your profits arise. It\r\nmatters nothing to you who governs America, if your manufactures find\r\na consumption there. Some articles will consequently be obtained from\r\nother places, and it is right that they should; but the demand for\r\nothers will increase, by the great influx of inhabitants which a state\r\nof independence and peace will occasion, and in the final event you may\r\nbe enriched. The commerce of America is perfectly free, and ever will\r\nbe so. She will consign away no part of it to any nation. She has not\r\nto her friends, and certainly will not to her enemies; though it is\r\nprobable that your narrow-minded politicians, thinking to please you\r\nthereby, may some time or other unnecessarily make such a proposal.\r\nTrade flourishes best when it is free, and it is weak policy to attempt\r\nto fetter it. Her treaty with France is on the most liberal and generous\r\nprinciples, and the French, in their conduct towards her, have proved\r\nthemselves to be philosophers, politicians, and gentlemen.\r\n\r\nTo the ministry I likewise address myself. You, gentlemen, have studied\r\nthe ruin of your country, from which it is not within your abilities to\r\nrescue her. Your attempts to recover her are as ridiculous as your plans\r\nwhich involved her are detestable. The commissioners, being about to\r\ndepart, will probably bring you this, and with it my sixth number,\r\naddressed to them; and in so doing they carry back more Common Sense\r\nthan they brought, and you likewise will have more than when you sent\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHaving thus addressed you severally, I conclude by addressing you\r\ncollectively. It is a long lane that has no turning. A period of sixteen\r\nyears of misconduct and misfortune, is certainly long enough for any one\r\nnation to suffer under; and upon a supposition that war is not declared\r\nbetween France and you, I beg to place a line of conduct before you\r\nthat will easily lead you out of all your troubles. It has been hinted\r\nbefore, and cannot be too much attended to.\r\n\r\nSuppose America had remained unknown to Europe till the present year,\r\nand that Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, in another voyage round the world,\r\nhad made the first discovery of her, in the same condition that she is\r\nnow in, of arts, arms, numbers, and civilization. What, I ask, in that\r\ncase, would have been your conduct towards her? For that will point out\r\nwhat it ought to be now. The problems and their solutions are equal,\r\nand the right line of the one is the parallel of the other. The question\r\ntakes in every circumstance that can possibly arise. It reduces politics\r\nto a simple thought, and is moreover a mode of investigation, in which,\r\nwhile you are studying your interest the simplicity of the case will\r\ncheat you into good temper. You have nothing to do but to suppose that\r\nyou have found America, and she appears found to your hand, and while\r\nin the joy of your heart you stand still to admire her, the path of\r\npolitics rises straight before you.\r\n\r\nWere I disposed to paint a contrast, I could easily set off what you\r\nhave done in the present case, against what you would have done in that\r\ncase, and by justly opposing them, conclude a picture that would make\r\nyou blush. But, as, when any of the prouder passions are hurt, it is\r\nmuch better philosophy to let a man slip into a good temper than to\r\nattack him in a bad one, for that reason, therefore, I only state the\r\ncase, and leave you to reflect upon it.\r\n\r\nTo go a little back into politics, it will be found that the true\r\ninterest of Britain lay in proposing and promoting the independence of\r\nAmerica immediately after the last peace; for the expense which Britain\r\nhad then incurred by defending America as her own dominions, ought to\r\nhave shown her the policy and necessity of changing the style of the\r\ncountry, as the best probable method of preventing future wars and\r\nexpense, and the only method by which she could hold the commerce\r\nwithout the charge of sovereignty. Besides which, the title which she\r\nassumed, of parent country, led to, and pointed out the propriety,\r\nwisdom and advantage of a separation; for, as in private life, children\r\ngrow into men, and by setting up for themselves, extend and secure the\r\ninterest of the whole family, so in the settlement of colonies large\r\nenough to admit of maturity, the same policy should be pursued, and the\r\nsame consequences would follow. Nothing hurts the affections both of\r\nparents and children so much, as living too closely connected, and\r\nkeeping up the distinction too long. Domineering will not do over those,\r\nwho, by a progress in life, have become equal in rank to their parents,\r\nthat is, when they have families of their own; and though they may\r\nconceive themselves the subjects of their advice, will not suppose them\r\nthe objects of their government. I do not, by drawing this parallel,\r\nmean to admit the title of parent country, because, if it is due any\r\nwhere, it is due to Europe collectively, and the first settlers from\r\nEngland were driven here by persecution. I mean only to introduce the\r\nterm for the sake of policy and to show from your title the line of your\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nWhen you saw the state of strength and opulence, and that by her own\r\nindustry, which America arrived at, you ought to have advised her to set\r\nup for herself, and proposed an alliance of interest with her, and in\r\nso doing you would have drawn, and that at her own expense, more real\r\nadvantage, and more military supplies and assistance, both of ships and\r\nmen, than from any weak and wrangling government that you could exercise\r\nover her. In short, had you studied only the domestic politics of a\r\nfamily, you would have learned how to govern the state; but, instead of\r\nthis easy and natural line, you flew out into every thing which was\r\nwild and outrageous, till, by following the passion and stupidity of the\r\npilot, you wrecked the vessel within sight of the shore.\r\n\r\nHaving shown what you ought to have done, I now proceed to show why it\r\nwas not done. The caterpillar circle of the court had an interest\r\nto pursue, distinct from, and opposed to yours; for though by the\r\nindependence of America and an alliance therewith, the trade would have\r\ncontinued, if not increased, as in many articles neither country can go\r\nto a better market, and though by defending and protecting herself,\r\nshe would have been no expense to you, and consequently your\r\nnational charges would have decreased, and your taxes might have been\r\nproportionably lessened thereby; yet the striking off so many places\r\nfrom the court calendar was put in opposition to the interest of the\r\nnation. The loss of thirteen government ships, with their appendages,\r\nhere and in England, is a shocking sound in the ear of a hungry\r\ncourtier. Your present king and ministry will be the ruin of you; and\r\nyou had better risk a revolution and call a Congress, than be thus led\r\non from madness to despair, and from despair to ruin. America has set\r\nyou the example, and you may follow it and be free.\r\n\r\nI now come to the last part, a war with France. This is what no man in\r\nhis senses will advise you to, and all good men would wish to prevent.\r\nWhether France will declare war against you, is not for me in this place\r\nto mention, or to hint, even if I knew it; but it must be madness in you\r\nto do it first. The matter is come now to a full crisis, and peace is\r\neasy if willingly set about. Whatever you may think, France has behaved\r\nhandsomely to you. She would have been unjust to herself to have acted\r\notherwise than she did; and having accepted our offer of alliance she\r\ngave you genteel notice of it. There was nothing in her conduct reserved\r\nor indelicate, and while she announced her determination to support her\r\ntreaty, she left you to give the first offence. America, on her part,\r\nhas exhibited a character of firmness to the world. Unprepared and\r\nunarmed, without form or government, she, singly opposed a nation\r\nthat domineered over half the globe. The greatness of the deed demands\r\nrespect; and though you may feel resentment, you are compelled both to\r\nwonder and admire.\r\n\r\nHere I rest my arguments and finish my address. Such as it is, it is a\r\ngift, and you are welcome. It was always my design to dedicate a Crisis\r\nto you, when the time should come that would properly make it a Crisis;\r\nand when, likewise, I should catch myself in a temper to write it, and\r\nsuppose you in a condition to read it. That time has now arrived, and\r\nwith it the opportunity for conveyance. For the commissioners--poor\r\ncommissioners! having proclaimed, that \"yet forty days and Nineveh shall\r\nbe overthrown,\" have waited out the date, and, discontented with their\r\nGod, are returning to their gourd. And all the harm I wish them is, that\r\nit may not wither about their ears, and that they may not make their\r\nexit in the belly of a whale.\r\n\r\nCOMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Nov. 21, 1778.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Though in the tranquillity of my mind I have concluded with a\r\nlaugh, yet I have something to mention to the commissioners, which, to\r\nthem, is serious and worthy their attention. Their authority is derived\r\nfrom an Act of Parliament, which likewise describes and limits their\r\nofficial powers. Their commission, therefore, is only a recital, and\r\npersonal investiture, of those powers, or a nomination and description\r\nof the persons who are to execute them. Had it contained any thing\r\ncontrary to, or gone beyond the line of, the written law from which\r\nit is derived, and by which it is bound, it would, by the English\r\nconstitution, have been treason in the crown, and the king been subject\r\nto an impeachment. He dared not, therefore, put in his commission what\r\nyou have put in your proclamation, that is, he dared not have authorised\r\nyou in that commission to burn and destroy any thing in America. You are\r\nboth in the act and in the commission styled commissioners for restoring\r\npeace, and the methods for doing it are there pointed out. Your last\r\nproclamation is signed by you as commissioners under that act. You\r\nmake Parliament the patron of its contents. Yet, in the body of it, you\r\ninsert matters contrary both to the spirit and letter of the act, and\r\nwhat likewise your king dared not have put in his commission to you. The\r\nstate of things in England, gentlemen, is too ticklish for you to run\r\nhazards. You are accountable to Parliament for the execution of that act\r\naccording to the letter of it. Your heads may pay for breaking it, for\r\nyou certainly have broke it by exceeding it. And as a friend, who would\r\nwish you to escape the paw of the lion, as well as the belly of the\r\nwhale, I civilly hint to you, to keep within compass.\r\n\r\nSir Harry Clinton, strictly speaking, is as accountable as the rest; for\r\nthough a general, he is likewise a commissioner, acting under a superior\r\nauthority. His first obedience is due to the act; and his plea of being\r\na general, will not and cannot clear him as a commissioner, for that\r\nwould suppose the crown, in its single capacity, to have a power of\r\ndispensing with an Act of Parliament. Your situation, gentlemen, is nice\r\nand critical, and the more so because England is unsettled. Take heed!\r\nRemember the times of Charles the First! For Laud and Stafford fell by\r\ntrusting to a hope like yours.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown you the danger of your proclamation, I now show you\r\nthe folly of it. The means contradict your design: you threaten to lay\r\nwaste, in order to render America a useless acquisition of alliance to\r\nFrance. I reply, that the more destruction you commit (if you could do\r\nit) the more valuable to France you make that alliance. You can destroy\r\nonly houses and goods; and by so doing you increase our demand upon her\r\nfor materials and merchandise; for the wants of one nation, provided it\r\nhas freedom and credit, naturally produce riches to the other; and,\r\nas you can neither ruin the land nor prevent the vegetation, you would\r\nincrease the exportation of our produce in payment, which would be to\r\nher a new fund of wealth. In short, had you cast about for a plan on\r\npurpose to enrich your enemies, you could not have hit upon a better.\r\n\r\n                                           C. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS VIII. ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"TRUSTING (says the king of England in his speech of November last,)\r\nin the divine providence, and in the justice of my cause, I am firmly\r\nresolved to prosecute the war with vigor, and to make every exertion\r\nin order to compel our enemies to equitable terms of peace and\r\naccommodation.\" To this declaration the United States of America, and\r\nthe confederated powers of Europe will reply, if Britain will have war,\r\nshe shall have enough of it.\r\n\r\nFive years have nearly elapsed since the commencement of hostilities,\r\nand every campaign, by a gradual decay, has lessened your ability to\r\nconquer, without producing a serious thought on your condition or your\r\nfate. Like a prodigal lingering in an habitual consumption, you feel\r\nthe relics of life, and mistake them for recovery. New schemes, like\r\nnew medicines, have administered fresh hopes, and prolonged the disease\r\ninstead of curing it. A change of generals, like a change of physicians,\r\nserved only to keep the flattery alive, and furnish new pretences for\r\nnew extravagance.\r\n\r\n\"Can Britain fail?\"* has been proudly asked at the undertaking of every\r\nenterprise; and that \"whatever she wills is fate,\"*(2) has been given\r\nwith the solemnity of prophetic confidence; and though the question\r\nhas been constantly replied to by disappointment, and the prediction\r\nfalsified by misfortune, yet still the insult continued, and your\r\ncatalogue of national evils increased therewith. Eager to persuade\r\nthe world of her power, she considered destruction as the minister of\r\ngreatness, and conceived that the glory of a nation like that of an\r\n[American] Indian, lay in the number of its scalps and the miseries\r\nwhich it inflicts.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Whitehead's New Year's ode for 1776.\r\n*(2) Ode at the installation of Lord North, for Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity of Oxford.\r\n\r\nFire, sword and want, as far as the arms of Britain could extend them,\r\nhave been spread with wanton cruelty along the coast of America; and\r\nwhile you, remote from the scene of suffering, had nothing to lose\r\nand as little to dread, the information reached you like a tale of\r\nantiquity, in which the distance of time defaces the conception, and\r\nchanges the severest sorrows into conversable amusement.\r\n\r\nThis makes the second paper, addressed perhaps in vain, to the people\r\nof England. That advice should be taken wherever example has failed,\r\nor precept be regarded where warning is ridiculed, is like a picture\r\nof hope resting on despair: but when time shall stamp with universal\r\ncurrency the facts you have long encountered with a laugh, and the\r\nirresistible evidence of accumulated losses, like the handwriting on\r\nthe wall, shall add terror to distress, you will then, in a conflict of\r\nsuffering, learn to sympathize with others by feeling for yourselves.\r\n\r\nThe triumphant appearance of the combined fleets in the channel and at\r\nyour harbor's mouth, and the expedition of Captain Paul Jones, on the\r\nwestern and eastern coasts of England and Scotland, will, by placing\r\nyou in the condition of an endangered country, read to you a stronger\r\nlecture on the calamities of invasion, and bring to your minds a truer\r\npicture of promiscuous distress, than the most finished rhetoric can\r\ndescribe or the keenest imagination conceive.\r\n\r\nHitherto you have experienced the expenses, but nothing of the miseries\r\nof war. Your disappointments have been accompanied with no immediate\r\nsuffering, and your losses came to you only by intelligence. Like fire\r\nat a distance you heard not even the cry; you felt not the danger, you\r\nsaw not the confusion. To you every thing has been foreign but the taxes\r\nto support it. You knew not what it was to be alarmed at midnight with\r\nan armed enemy in the streets. You were strangers to the distressing\r\nscene of a family in flight, and to the thousand restless cares and\r\ntender sorrows that incessantly arose. To see women and children\r\nwandering in the severity of winter, with the broken remains of a well\r\nfurnished house, and seeking shelter in every crib and hut, were matters\r\nthat you had no conception of. You knew not what it was to stand by and\r\nsee your goods chopped for fuel, and your beds ripped to pieces to make\r\npackages for plunder. The misery of others, like a tempestuous night,\r\nadded to the pleasures of your own security. You even enjoyed the storm,\r\nby contemplating the difference of conditions, and that which carried\r\nsorrow into the breasts of thousands served but to heighten in you a\r\nspecies of tranquil pride. Yet these are but the fainter sufferings\r\nof war, when compared with carnage and slaughter, the miseries of a\r\nmilitary hospital, or a town in flames.\r\n\r\nThe people of America, by anticipating distress, had fortified their\r\nminds against every species you could inflict. They had resolved to\r\nabandon their homes, to resign them to destruction, and to seek new\r\nsettlements rather than submit. Thus familiarized to misfortune, before\r\nit arrived, they bore their portion with the less regret: the justness\r\nof their cause was a continual source of consolation, and the hope of\r\nfinal victory, which never left them, served to lighten the load and\r\nsweeten the cup allotted them to drink.\r\n\r\nBut when their troubles shall become yours, and invasion be transferred\r\nupon the invaders, you will have neither their extended wilderness\r\nto fly to, their cause to comfort you, nor their hope to rest upon.\r\nDistress with them was sharpened by no self-reflection. They had not\r\nbrought it on themselves. On the contrary, they had by every proceeding\r\nendeavored to avoid it, and had descended even below the mark of\r\ncongressional character, to prevent a war. The national honor or the\r\nadvantages of independence were matters which, at the commencement of\r\nthe dispute, they had never studied, and it was only at the last moment\r\nthat the measure was resolved on. Thus circumstanced, they naturally\r\nand conscientiously felt a dependence upon providence. They had a clear\r\npretension to it, and had they failed therein, infidelity had gained a\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nBut your condition is the reverse of theirs. Every thing you suffer you\r\nhave sought: nay, had you created mischiefs on purpose to inherit\r\nthem, you could not have secured your title by a firmer deed. The world\r\nawakens with no pity it your complaints. You felt none for others; you\r\ndeserve none for yourselves. Nature does not interest herself in cases\r\nlike yours, but, on the contrary, turns from them with dislike, and\r\nabandons them to punishment. You may now present memorials to what court\r\nyou please, but so far as America is the object, none will listen.\r\nThe policy of Europe, and the propensity there in every mind to curb\r\ninsulting ambition, and bring cruelty to judgment, are unitedly against\r\nyou; and where nature and interest reinforce with each other, the\r\ncompact is too intimate to be dissolved.\r\n\r\nMake but the case of others your own, and your own theirs, and you\r\nwill then have a clear idea of the whole. Had France acted towards her\r\ncolonies as you have done, you would have branded her with every epithet\r\nof abhorrence; and had you, like her, stepped in to succor a struggling\r\npeople, all Europe must have echoed with your own applauses. But\r\nentangled in the passion of dispute you see it not as you ought, and\r\nform opinions thereon which suit with no interest but your own. You\r\nwonder that America does not rise in union with you to impose on herself\r\na portion of your taxes and reduce herself to unconditional submission.\r\nYou are amazed that the southern powers of Europe do not assist you\r\nin conquering a country which is afterwards to be turned against\r\nthemselves; and that the northern ones do not contribute to reinstate\r\nyou in America who already enjoy the market for naval stores by the\r\nseparation. You seem surprised that Holland does not pour in her succors\r\nto maintain you mistress of the seas, when her own commerce is suffering\r\nby your act of navigation; or that any country should study her own\r\ninterest while yours is on the carpet.\r\n\r\nSuch excesses of passionate folly, and unjust as well as unwise\r\nresentment, have driven you on, like Pharaoh, to unpitied miseries, and\r\nwhile the importance of the quarrel shall perpetuate your disgrace, the\r\nflag of America will carry it round the world. The natural feelings of\r\nevery rational being will be against you, and wherever the story shall\r\nbe told, you will have neither excuse nor consolation left. With an\r\nunsparing hand, and an insatiable mind, you have desolated the world,\r\nto gain dominion and to lose it; and while, in a frenzy of avarice and\r\nambition, the east and the west are doomed to tributary bondage, you\r\nrapidly earned destruction as the wages of a nation.\r\n\r\nAt the thoughts of a war at home, every man amongst you ought to\r\ntremble. The prospect is far more dreadful there than in America. Here\r\nthe party that was against the measures of the continent were in general\r\ncomposed of a kind of neutrals, who added strength to neither army.\r\nThere does not exist a being so devoid of sense and sentiment as to\r\ncovet \"unconditional submission,\" and therefore no man in America could\r\nbe with you in principle. Several might from a cowardice of mind, prefer\r\nit to the hardships and dangers of opposing it; but the same disposition\r\nthat gave them such a choice, unfitted them to act either for or against\r\nus. But England is rent into parties, with equal shares of resolution.\r\nThe principle which produced the war divides the nation. Their\r\nanimosities are in the highest state of fermentation, and both sides, by\r\na call of the militia, are in arms. No human foresight can discern, no\r\nconclusion can be formed, what turn a war might take, if once set on\r\nfoot by an invasion. She is not now in a fit disposition to make a\r\ncommon cause of her own affairs, and having no conquests to hope for\r\nabroad, and nothing but expenses arising at home, her everything is\r\nstaked upon a defensive combat, and the further she goes the worse she\r\nis off.\r\n\r\nThere are situations that a nation may be in, in which peace or war,\r\nabstracted from every other consideration, may be politically right or\r\nwrong. When nothing can be lost by a war, but what must be lost without\r\nit, war is then the policy of that country; and such was the situation\r\nof America at the commencement of hostilities: but when no security can\r\nbe gained by a war, but what may be accomplished by a peace, the case\r\nbecomes reversed, and such now is the situation of England.\r\n\r\nThat America is beyond the reach of conquest, is a fact which experience\r\nhas shown and time confirmed, and this admitted, what, I ask, is now the\r\nobject of contention? If there be any honor in pursuing self-destruction\r\nwith inflexible passion--if national suicide be the perfection of\r\nnational glory, you may, with all the pride of criminal happiness,\r\nexpire unenvied and unrivalled. But when the tumult of war shall cease,\r\nand the tempest of present passions be succeeded by calm reflection, or\r\nwhen those, who, surviving its fury, shall inherit from you a legacy\r\nof debts and misfortunes, when the yearly revenue scarcely be able to\r\ndischarge the interest of the one, and no possible remedy be left for\r\nthe other, ideas far different from the present will arise, and embitter\r\nthe remembrance of former follies. A mind disarmed of its rage feels no\r\npleasure in contemplating a frantic quarrel. Sickness of thought, the\r\nsure consequence of conduct like yours, leaves no ability for enjoyment,\r\nno relish for resentment; and though, like a man in a fit, you feel\r\nnot the injury of the struggle, nor distinguish between strength and\r\ndisease, the weakness will nevertheless be proportioned to the violence,\r\nand the sense of pain increase with the recovery.\r\n\r\nTo what persons or to whose system of politics you owe your present\r\nstate of wretchedness, is a matter of total indifference to America.\r\nThey have contributed, however unwillingly, to set her above themselves,\r\nand she, in the tranquillity of conquest, resigns the inquiry. The case\r\nnow is not so properly who began the war, as who continues it. That\r\nthere are men in all countries to whom a state of war is a mine of\r\nwealth, is a fact never to be doubted. Characters like these naturally\r\nbreed in the putrefaction of distempered times, and after fattening\r\non the disease, they perish with it, or, impregnated with the stench,\r\nretreat into obscurity.\r\n\r\nBut there are several erroneous notions to which you likewise owe a\r\nshare of your misfortunes, and which, if continued, will only increase\r\nyour trouble and your losses. An opinion hangs about the gentlemen\r\nof the minority, that America would relish measures under their\r\nadministration, which she would not from the present cabinet. On this\r\nrock Lord Chatham would have split had he gained the helm, and several\r\nof his survivors are steering the same course. Such distinctions in\r\nthe infancy of the argument had some degree of foundation, but they now\r\nserve no other purpose than to lengthen out a war, in which the limits\r\nof a dispute, being fixed by the fate of arms, and guaranteed by\r\ntreaties, are not to be changed or altered by trivial circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe ministry, and many of the minority, sacrifice their time in\r\ndisputing on a question with which they have nothing to do, namely,\r\nwhether America shall be independent or not. Whereas the only question\r\nthat can come under their determination is, whether they will accede to\r\nit or not. They confound a military question with a political one, and\r\nundertake to supply by a vote what they lost by a battle. Say she shall\r\nnot be independent, and it will signify as much as if they voted\r\nagainst a decree of fate, or say that she shall, and she will be no more\r\nindependent than before. Questions which, when determined, cannot be\r\nexecuted, serve only to show the folly of dispute and the weakness of\r\ndisputants.\r\n\r\nFrom a long habit of calling America your own, you suppose her governed\r\nby the same prejudices and conceits which govern yourselves. Because you\r\nhave set up a particular denomination of religion to the exclusion of\r\nall others, you imagine she must do the same, and because you, with an\r\nunsociable narrowness of mind, have cherished enmity against France and\r\nSpain, you suppose her alliance must be defective in friendship.\r\nCopying her notions of the world from you, she formerly thought as you\r\ninstructed, but now feeling herself free, and the prejudice removed, she\r\nthinks and acts upon a different system. It frequently happens that\r\nin proportion as we are taught to dislike persons and countries, not\r\nknowing why, we feel an ardor of esteem upon the removal of the mistake:\r\nit seems as if something was to be made amends for, and we eagerly give\r\nin to every office of friendship, to atone for the injury of the error.\r\nBut, perhaps, there is something in the extent of countries, which,\r\namong the generality of people, insensibly communicates extension of the\r\nmind. The soul of an islander, in its native state, seems bounded by\r\nthe foggy confines of the water's edge, and all beyond affords to him\r\nmatters only for profit or curiosity, not for friendship. His island\r\nis to him his world, and fixed to that, his every thing centers in it;\r\nwhile those who are inhabitants of a continent, by casting their eye\r\nover a larger field, take in likewise a larger intellectual circuit,\r\nand thus approaching nearer to an acquaintance with the universe, their\r\natmosphere of thought is extended, and their liberality fills a wider\r\nspace. In short, our minds seem to be measured by countries when we are\r\nmen, as they are by places when we are children, and until something\r\nhappens to disentangle us from the prejudice, we serve under it without\r\nperceiving it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, it may be remarked, that men who study any\r\nuniversal science, the principles of which are universally known, or\r\nadmitted, and applied without distinction to the common benefit of all\r\ncountries, obtain thereby a larger share of philanthropy than those\r\nwho only study national arts and improvements. Natural philosophy,\r\nmathematics and astronomy, carry the mind from the country to the\r\ncreation, and give it a fitness suited to the extent. It was not\r\nNewton's honor, neither could it be his pride, that he was an\r\nEnglishman, but that he was a philosopher, the heavens had liberated him\r\nfrom the prejudices of an island, and science had expanded his soul as\r\nboundless as his studies.\r\n\r\n                                          COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, March, 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS IX. (HAD AMERICA PURSUED HER ADVANTAGES)\r\n\r\n\r\nHAD America pursued her advantages with half the spirit that she\r\nresisted her misfortunes, she would, before now, have been a conquering\r\nand a peaceful people; but lulled in the lap of soft tranquillity, she\r\nrested on her hopes, and adversity only has convulsed her into action.\r\nWhether subtlety or sincerity at the close of the last year induced the\r\nenemy to an appearance for peace, is a point not material to know; it is\r\nsufficient that we see the effects it has had on our politics, and that\r\nwe sternly rise to resent the delusion.\r\n\r\nThe war, on the part of America, has been a war of natural feelings.\r\nBrave in distress; serene in conquest; drowsy while at rest; and in\r\nevery situation generously disposed to peace; a dangerous calm, and\r\na most heightened zeal have, as circumstances varied, succeeded each\r\nother. Every passion but that of despair has been called to a tour\r\nof duty; and so mistaken has been the enemy, of our abilities\r\nand disposition, that when she supposed us conquered, we rose the\r\nconquerors. The extensiveness of the United States, and the variety of\r\ntheir resources; the universality of their cause, the quick operation of\r\ntheir feelings, and the similarity of their sentiments, have, in every\r\ntrying situation, produced a something, which, favored by providence,\r\nand pursued with ardor, has accomplished in an instant the business of\r\na campaign. We have never deliberately sought victory, but snatched it;\r\nand bravely undone in an hour the blotted operations of a season.\r\n\r\nThe reported fate of Charleston, like the misfortunes of 1776, has at\r\nlast called forth a spirit, and kindled up a flame, which perhaps\r\nno other event could have produced. If the enemy has circulated a\r\nfalsehood, they have unwisely aggravated us into life, and if they have\r\ntold us the truth, they have unintentionally done us a service. We were\r\nreturning with folded arms from the fatigues of war, and thinking and\r\nsitting leisurely down to enjoy repose. The dependence that has been\r\nput upon Charleston threw a drowsiness over America. We looked on the\r\nbusiness done--the conflict over--the matter settled--or that all which\r\nremained unfinished would follow of itself. In this state of dangerous\r\nrelaxation, exposed to the poisonous infusions of the enemy, and having\r\nno common danger to attract our attention, we were extinguishing, by\r\nstages, the ardor we began with, and surrendering by piece-meal the\r\nvirtue that defended us.\r\n\r\nAfflicting as the loss of Charleston may be, yet if it universally rouse\r\nus from the slumber of twelve months past, and renew in us the spirit of\r\nformer days, it will produce an advantage more important than its loss.\r\nAmerica ever is what she thinks herself to be. Governed by sentiment,\r\nand acting her own mind, she becomes, as she pleases, the victor or the\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nIt is not the conquest of towns, nor the accidental capture of\r\ngarrisons, that can reduce a country so extensive as this. The\r\nsufferings of one part can never be relieved by the exertions of\r\nanother, and there is no situation the enemy can be placed in that does\r\nnot afford to us the same advantages which he seeks himself. By dividing\r\nhis force, he leaves every post attackable. It is a mode of war that\r\ncarries with it a confession of weakness, and goes on the principle of\r\ndistress rather than conquest.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the enemy is visible, not only in their operations, but\r\nin their plans; Charleston originally made but a secondary object in the\r\nsystem of attack, and it is now become their principal one, because\r\nthey have not been able to succeed elsewhere. It would have carried a\r\ncowardly appearance in Europe had they formed their grand expedition, in\r\n1776, against a part of the continent where there was no army, or not\r\na sufficient one to oppose them; but failing year after year in their\r\nimpressions here, and to the eastward and northward, they deserted their\r\ncapital design, and prudently contenting themselves with what they can\r\nget, give a flourish of honor to conceal disgrace.\r\n\r\nBut this piece-meal work is not conquering the continent. It is a\r\ndiscredit in them to attempt it, and in us to suffer it. It is now full\r\ntime to put an end to a war of aggravations, which, on one side, has\r\nno possible object, and on the other has every inducement which honor,\r\ninterest, safety and happiness can inspire. If we suffer them much\r\nlonger to remain among us, we shall become as bad as themselves.\r\nAn association of vice will reduce us more than the sword. A nation\r\nhardened in the practice of iniquity knows better how to profit by it,\r\nthan a young country newly corrupted. We are not a match for them in the\r\nline of advantageous guilt, nor they for us on the principles which we\r\nbravely set out with. Our first days were our days of honor. They have\r\nmarked the character of America wherever the story of her wars are told;\r\nand convinced of this, we have nothing to do but wisely and unitedly to\r\ntread the well known track. The progress of a war is often as ruinous\r\nto individuals, as the issue of it is to a nation; and it is not only\r\nnecessary that our forces be such that we be conquerors in the end,\r\nbut that by timely exertions we be secure in the interim. The present\r\ncampaign will afford an opportunity which has never presented itself\r\nbefore, and the preparations for it are equally necessary, whether\r\nCharleston stand or fall. Suppose the first, it is in that case only\r\na failure of the enemy, not a defeat. All the conquest that a besieged\r\ntown can hope for, is, not to be conquered; and compelling an enemy\r\nto raise the siege, is to the besieged a victory. But there must be\r\na probability amounting almost to a certainty, that would justify a\r\ngarrison marching out to attack a retreat. Therefore should Charleston\r\nnot be taken, and the enemy abandon the siege, every other part of the\r\ncontinent should prepare to meet them; and, on the contrary, should it\r\nbe taken, the same preparations are necessary to balance the loss, and\r\nput ourselves in a position to co-operate with our allies, immediately\r\non their arrival.\r\n\r\nWe are not now fighting our battles alone, as we were in 1776; England,\r\nfrom a malicious disposition to America, has not only not declared war\r\nagainst France and Spain, but, the better to prosecute her passions\r\nhere, has afforded those powers no military object, and avoids them,\r\nto distress us. She will suffer her West India islands to be overrun by\r\nFrance, and her southern settlements to be taken by Spain, rather than\r\nquit the object that gratifies her revenge. This conduct, on the part\r\nof Britain, has pointed out the propriety of France sending a naval and\r\nland force to co-operate with America on the spot. Their arrival cannot\r\nbe very distant, nor the ravages of the enemy long. The recruiting the\r\narmy, and procuring the supplies, are the two things most necessary to\r\nbe accomplished, and a capture of either of the enemy's divisions will\r\nrestore to America peace and plenty.\r\n\r\nAt a crisis, big, like the present, with expectation and events, the\r\nwhole country is called to unanimity and exertion. Not an ability ought\r\nnow to sleep, that can produce but a mite to the general good, nor even\r\na whisper to pass that militates against it. The necessity of the case,\r\nand the importance of the consequences, admit no delay from a friend,\r\nno apology from an enemy. To spare now, would be the height of\r\nextravagance, and to consult present ease, would be to sacrifice it\r\nperhaps forever.\r\n\r\nAmerica, rich in patriotism and produce, can want neither men nor\r\nsupplies, when a serious necessity calls them forth. The slow\r\noperation of taxes, owing to the extensiveness of collection, and their\r\ndepreciated value before they arrived in the treasury, have, in many\r\ninstances, thrown a burden upon government, which has been artfully\r\ninterpreted by the enemy into a general decline throughout the\r\ncountry. Yet this, inconvenient as it may at first appear, is not only\r\nremediable, but may be turned to an immediate advantage; for it makes no\r\nreal difference, whether a certain number of men, or company of militia\r\n(and in this country every man is a militia-man), are directed by law\r\nto send a recruit at their own expense, or whether a tax is laid on them\r\nfor that purpose, and the man hired by government afterwards. The first,\r\nif there is any difference, is both cheapest and best, because it saves\r\nthe expense which would attend collecting it as a tax, and brings the\r\nman sooner into the field than the modes of recruiting formerly used;\r\nand, on this principle, a law has been passed in this state, for\r\nrecruiting two men from each company of militia, which will add upwards\r\nof a thousand to the force of the country.\r\n\r\nBut the flame which has broken forth in this city since the report from\r\nNew York, of the loss of Charleston, not only does honor to the place,\r\nbut, like the blaze of 1776, will kindle into action the scattered\r\nsparks throughout America. The valor of a country may be learned by the\r\nbravery of its soldiery, and the general cast of its inhabitants, but\r\nconfidence of success is best discovered by the active measures pursued\r\nby men of property; and when the spirit of enterprise becomes so\r\nuniversal as to act at once on all ranks of men, a war may then, and not\r\ntill then, be styled truly popular.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, the ardor of the enterprising part was considerably checked by\r\nthe real revolt of some, and the coolness of others. But in the present\r\ncase, there is a firmness in the substance and property of the country\r\nto the public cause. An association has been entered into by\r\nthe merchants, tradesmen, and principal inhabitants of the city\r\n[Philadelphia], to receive and support the new state money at the value\r\nof gold and silver; a measure which, while it does them honor, will\r\nlikewise contribute to their interest, by rendering the operations of\r\nthe campaign convenient and effectual.\r\n\r\nNor has the spirit of exertion stopped here. A voluntary subscription is\r\nlikewise begun, to raise a fund of hard money, to be given as bounties,\r\nto fill up the full quota of the Pennsylvania line. It has been the\r\nremark of the enemy, that every thing in America has been done by the\r\nforce of government; but when she sees individuals throwing in their\r\nvoluntary aid, and facilitating the public measures in concert with the\r\nestablished powers of the country, it will convince her that the cause\r\nof America stands not on the will of a few but on the broad foundation\r\nof property and popularity.\r\n\r\nThus aided and thus supported, disaffection will decline, and the\r\nwithered head of tyranny expire in America. The ravages of the enemy\r\nwill be short and limited, and like all their former ones, will produce\r\na victory over themselves.\r\n\r\n                                       COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, June 9, 1780.\r\n\r\nP. S. At the time of writing this number of the Crisis, the loss of\r\nCharleston, though believed by some, was more confidently disbelieved\r\nby others. But there ought to be no longer a doubt upon the matter.\r\nCharleston is gone, and I believe for the want of a sufficient supply of\r\nprovisions. The man that does not now feel for the honor of the best\r\nand noblest cause that ever a country engaged in, and exert himself\r\naccordingly, is no longer worthy of a peaceable residence among a people\r\ndetermined to be free.\r\n\r\n                                             C. S.\r\n\r\n                       THE CRISIS EXTRAORDINARY\r\n\r\n                      ON THE SUBJECT OF TAXATION.\r\n\r\nIT IS impossible to sit down and think seriously on the affairs of\r\nAmerica, but the original principles upon which she resisted, and\r\nthe glow and ardor which they inspired, will occur like the undefaced\r\nremembrance of a lovely scene. To trace over in imagination the purity\r\nof the cause, the voluntary sacrifices that were made to support it,\r\nand all the various turnings of the war in its defence, is at once both\r\npaying and receiving respect. The principles deserve to be remembered,\r\nand to remember them rightly is repossessing them. In this indulgence\r\nof generous recollection, we become gainers by what we seem to give, and\r\nthe more we bestow the richer we become.\r\n\r\nSo extensively right was the ground on which America proceeded, that it\r\nnot only took in every just and liberal sentiment which could impress\r\nthe heart, but made it the direct interest of every class and order\r\nof men to defend the country. The war, on the part of Britain, was\r\noriginally a war of covetousness. The sordid and not the splendid\r\npassions gave it being. The fertile fields and prosperous infancy of\r\nAmerica appeared to her as mines for tributary wealth. She viewed the\r\nhive, and disregarding the industry that had enriched it, thirsted for\r\nthe honey. But in the present stage of her affairs, the violence of\r\ntemper is added to the rage of avarice; and therefore, that which at\r\nthe first setting out proceeded from purity of principle and public\r\ninterest, is now heightened by all the obligations of necessity; for it\r\nrequires but little knowledge of human nature to discern what would\r\nbe the consequence, were America again reduced to the subjection of\r\nBritain. Uncontrolled power, in the hands of an incensed, imperious, and\r\nrapacious conqueror, is an engine of dreadful execution, and woe be to\r\nthat country over which it can be exercised. The names of Whig and Tory\r\nwould then be sunk in the general term of rebel, and the oppression,\r\nwhatever it might be, would, with very few instances of exception, light\r\nequally on all.\r\n\r\nBritain did not go to war with America for the sake of dominion, because\r\nshe was then in possession; neither was it for the extension of trade\r\nand commerce, because she had monopolized the whole, and the country\r\nhad yielded to it; neither was it to extinguish what she might call\r\nrebellion, because before she began no resistance existed. It could then\r\nbe from no other motive than avarice, or a design of establishing, in\r\nthe first instance, the same taxes in America as are paid in England\r\n(which, as I shall presently show, are above eleven times heavier than\r\nthe taxes we now pay for the present year, 1780) or, in the second\r\ninstance, to confiscate the whole property of America, in case of\r\nresistance and conquest of the latter, of which she had then no doubt.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to show what the taxes in England are, and what\r\nthe yearly expense of the present war is to her--what the taxes of\r\nthis country amount to, and what the annual expense of defending it\r\neffectually will be to us; and shall endeavor concisely to point out\r\nthe cause of our difficulties, and the advantages on one side, and the\r\nconsequences on the other, in case we do, or do not, put ourselves in\r\nan effectual state of defence. I mean to be open, candid, and sincere.\r\nI see a universal wish to expel the enemy from the country, a murmuring\r\nbecause the war is not carried on with more vigor, and my intention is\r\nto show, as shortly as possible, both the reason and the remedy.\r\n\r\nThe number of souls in England (exclusive of Scotland and Ireland) is\r\nseven millions,* and the number of souls in America is three millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * This is taking the highest number that the people of England have\r\nbeen, or can be rated at.\r\n\r\nThe amount of taxes in England (exclusive of Scotland and Ireland)\r\nwas, before the present war commenced, eleven millions six hundred and\r\nforty-two thousand six hundred and fifty-three pounds sterling; which,\r\non an average, is no less a sum than one pound thirteen shillings and\r\nthree-pence sterling per head per annum, men, women, and children;\r\nbesides county taxes, taxes for the support of the poor, and a tenth of\r\nall the produce of the earth for the support of the bishops and clergy.*\r\nNearly five millions of this sum went annually to pay the interest of\r\nthe national debt, contracted by former wars, and the remaining sum of\r\nsix millions six hundred and forty-two thousand six hundred pounds\r\nwas applied to defray the yearly expense of government, the peace\r\nestablishment of the army and navy, placemen, pensioners, etc.;\r\nconsequently the whole of the enormous taxes being thus appropriated,\r\nshe had nothing to spare out of them towards defraying the expenses\r\nof the present war or any other. Yet had she not been in debt at the\r\nbeginning of the war, as we were not, and, like us, had only a land and\r\nnot a naval war to carry on, her then revenue of eleven millions and a\r\nhalf pounds sterling would have defrayed all her annual expenses of\r\nwar and government within each year. * The following is taken from Dr.\r\nPrice's state of the taxes of England.\r\n\r\nAn account of the money drawn from the public by taxes, annually, being\r\nthe medium of three years before the year 1776.\r\n\r\n    Amount of customs in England                         2,528,275 L.\r\n    Amount of the excise in England                      4,649,892\r\n    Land tax at 3s.                                      1,300,000\r\n    Land tax at 1s. in the pound                           450,000\r\n    Salt duties                                            218,739\r\n    Duties on stamps, cards, dice, advertisements,\r\n      bonds, leases, indentures, newspapers,\r\n      almanacks, etc.                                      280,788\r\n    Duties on houses and windows                           385,369\r\n    Post office, seizures, wine licences, hackney\r\n      coaches, etc.                                        250,000\r\n    Annual profits from lotteries                          150,000\r\n    Expense of collecting the excise in England            297,887\r\n    Expense of collecting the customs in England           468,703\r\n    Interest of loans on the land tax at 4s. expenses\r\n      of collection, militia, etc.                         250,000\r\n    Perquisites, etc. to custom-house officers, &c.\r\n      supposed                                             250,000\r\n    Expense of collecting the salt duties in England\r\n      10 1/2 per cent.                                      27,000\r\n    Bounties on fish exported                               18,000\r\n    Expense of collecting the duties on stamps, cards,\r\n      advertisements, etc. at 5 and 1/4 per cent.           18,000\r\n\r\n                                                  Total 11,642,653 L.\r\n\r\nBut this not being the case with her, she is obliged to borrow about ten\r\nmillions pounds sterling, yearly, to prosecute the war that she is now\r\nengaged in, (this year she borrowed twelve) and lay on new taxes to\r\ndischarge the interest; allowing that the present war has cost her only\r\nfifty millions sterling, the interest thereon, at five per cent., will\r\nbe two millions and an half; therefore the amount of her taxes now\r\nmust be fourteen millions, which on an average is no less than forty\r\nshillings sterling, per head, men, women and children, throughout the\r\nnation. Now as this expense of fifty millions was borrowed on the hopes\r\nof conquering America, and as it was avarice which first induced her to\r\ncommence the war, how truly wretched and deplorable would the condition\r\nof this country be, were she, by her own remissness, to suffer an\r\nenemy of such a disposition, and so circumstanced, to reduce her to\r\nsubjection.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to the revenues of America.\r\n\r\nI have already stated the number of souls in America to be three\r\nmillions, and by a calculation that I have made, which I have every\r\nreason to believe is sufficiently correct, the whole expense of the\r\nwar, and the support of the several governments, may be defrayed for\r\ntwo million pounds sterling annually; which, on an average, is thirteen\r\nshillings and four pence per head, men, women, and children, and the\r\npeace establishment at the end of the war will be but three quarters of\r\na million, or five shillings sterling per head. Now, throwing out of\r\nthe question everything of honor, principle, happiness, freedom, and\r\nreputation in the world, and taking it up on the simple ground of\r\ninterest, I put the following case:\r\n\r\nSuppose Britain was to conquer America, and, as a conqueror, was to lay\r\nher under no other conditions than to pay the same proportion towards\r\nher annual revenue which the people of England pay: our share, in that\r\ncase, would be six million pounds sterling yearly. Can it then be\r\na question, whether it is best to raise two millions to defend the\r\ncountry, and govern it ourselves, and only three quarters of a million\r\nafterwards, or pay six millions to have it conquered, and let the enemy\r\ngovern it?\r\n\r\nCan it be supposed that conquerors would choose to put themselves in a\r\nworse condition than what they granted to the conquered? In England, the\r\ntax on rum is five shillings and one penny sterling per gallon, which is\r\none silver dollar and fourteen coppers. Now would it not be laughable to\r\nimagine, that after the expense they have been at, they would let either\r\nWhig or Tory drink it cheaper than themselves? Coffee, which is so\r\ninconsiderable an article of consumption and support here, is there\r\nloaded with a duty which makes the price between five and six shillings\r\nper pound, and a penalty of fifty pounds sterling on any person detected\r\nin roasting it in his own house. There is scarcely a necessary of life\r\nthat you can eat, drink, wear, or enjoy, that is not there loaded with\r\na tax; even the light from heaven is only permitted to shine into their\r\ndwellings by paying eighteen pence sterling per window annually; and the\r\nhumblest drink of life, small beer, cannot there be purchased without a\r\ntax of nearly two coppers per gallon, besides a heavy tax upon the malt,\r\nand another on the hops before it is brewed, exclusive of a land-tax on\r\nthe earth which produces them. In short, the condition of that country,\r\nin point of taxation, is so oppressive, the number of her poor so great,\r\nand the extravagance and rapaciousness of the court so enormous, that,\r\nwere they to effect a conquest of America, it is then only that the\r\ndistresses of America would begin. Neither would it signify anything\r\nto a man whether he be Whig or Tory. The people of England, and the\r\nministry of that country, know us by no such distinctions. What they\r\nwant is clear, solid revenue, and the modes which they would take to\r\nprocure it, would operate alike on all. Their manner of reasoning would\r\nbe short, because they would naturally infer, that if we were able to\r\ncarry on a war of five or six years against them, we were able to pay\r\nthe same taxes which they do.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that the expense of conducting the present war,\r\nand the government of the several states, may be done for two millions\r\nsterling, and the establishment in the time of peace, for three quarters\r\nof a million.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * I have made the calculations in sterling, because it is a rate\r\ngenerally known in all the states, and because, likewise, it admits of\r\nan easy comparison between our expenses to support the war, and those\r\nof the enemy. Four silver dollars and a half is one pound sterling, and\r\nthree pence over.\r\n\r\nAs to navy matters, they flourish so well, and are so well attended to\r\nby individuals, that I think it consistent on every principle of real\r\nuse and economy, to turn the navy into hard money (keeping only three or\r\nfour packets) and apply it to the service of the army. We shall not have\r\na ship the less; the use of them, and the benefit from them, will be\r\ngreatly increased, and their expense saved. We are now allied with a\r\nformidable naval power, from whom we derive the assistance of a navy.\r\nAnd the line in which we can prosecute the war, so as to reduce the\r\ncommon enemy and benefit the alliance most effectually, will be by\r\nattending closely to the land service.\r\n\r\nI estimate the charge of keeping up and maintaining an army, officering\r\nthem, and all expenses included, sufficient for the defence of the\r\ncountry, to be equal to the expense of forty thousand men at thirty\r\npounds sterling per head, which is one million two hundred thousand\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nI likewise allow four hundred thousand pounds for continental expenses\r\nat home and abroad.\r\n\r\nAnd four hundred thousand pounds for the support of the several state\r\ngovernments--the amount will then be:\r\n\r\n    For the army                                         1,200,000 L.\r\n    Continental expenses at home and abroad                400,000\r\n    Government of the several states                       400,000\r\n\r\n                                                   Total 2,000,000 L.\r\n\r\nI take the proportion of this state, Pennsylvania, to be an eighth part\r\nof the thirteen United States; the quota then for us to raise will be\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling; two hundred thousand\r\nof which will be our share for the support and pay of the army, and\r\ncontinental expenses at home and abroad, and fifty thousand pounds for\r\nthe support of the state government.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain an idea of the proportion in which the raising such a\r\nsum will fall, I make the following calculation:\r\n\r\nPennsylvania contains three hundred and seventy-five thousand\r\ninhabitants, men, women and children; which is likewise an eighth of the\r\nnumber of inhabitants of the whole United States: therefore, two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand pounds sterling to be raised among three hundred and\r\nseventy-five thousand persons, is, on an average, thirteen shillings\r\nand four pence per head, per annum, or something more than one shilling\r\nsterling per month. And our proportion of three quarters of a\r\nmillion for the government of the country, in time of peace, will be\r\nninety-three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds sterling; fifty\r\nthousand of which will be for the government expenses of the state,\r\nand forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds for continental\r\nexpenses at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe peace establishment then will, on an average, be five shillings\r\nsterling per head. Whereas, was England now to stop, and the war cease,\r\nher peace establishment would continue the same as it is now, viz. forty\r\nshillings per head; therefore was our taxes necessary for carrying on\r\nthe war, as much per head as hers now is, and the difference to be\r\nonly whether we should, at the end of the war, pay at the rate of five\r\nshillings per head, or forty shillings per head, the case needs no\r\nthinking of. But as we can securely defend and keep the country for\r\none third less than what our burden would be if it was conquered, and\r\nsupport the governments afterwards for one eighth of what Britain would\r\nlevy on us, and could I find a miser whose heart never felt the emotion\r\nof a spark of principle, even that man, uninfluenced by every love but\r\nthe love of money, and capable of no attachment but to his interest,\r\nwould and must, from the frugality which governs him, contribute to the\r\ndefence of the country, or he ceases to be a miser and becomes an idiot.\r\nBut when we take in with it every thing that can ornament mankind; when\r\nthe line of our interest becomes the line of our happiness; when all\r\nthat can cheer and animate the heart, when a sense of honor, fame,\r\ncharacter, at home and abroad, are interwoven not only with the security\r\nbut the increase of property, there exists not a man in America, unless\r\nhe be an hired emissary, who does not see that his good is connected\r\nwith keeping up a sufficient defence.\r\n\r\nI do not imagine that an instance can be produced in the world, of a\r\ncountry putting herself to such an amazing charge to conquer and enslave\r\nanother, as Britain has done. The sum is too great for her to think of\r\nwith any tolerable degree of temper; and when we consider the burden\r\nshe sustains, as well as the disposition she has shown, it would be the\r\nheight of folly in us to suppose that she would not reimburse herself by\r\nthe most rapid means, had she America once more within her power. With\r\nsuch an oppression of expense, what would an empty conquest be to her!\r\nWhat relief under such circumstances could she derive from a victory\r\nwithout a prize? It was money, it was revenue she first went to war for,\r\nand nothing but that would satisfy her. It is not the nature of avarice\r\nto be satisfied with any thing else. Every passion that acts upon\r\nmankind has a peculiar mode of operation. Many of them are temporary\r\nand fluctuating; they admit of cessation and variety. But avarice is a\r\nfixed, uniform passion. It neither abates of its vigor nor changes its\r\nobject; and the reason why it does not, is founded in the nature of\r\nthings, for wealth has not a rival where avarice is a ruling passion.\r\nOne beauty may excel another, and extinguish from the mind of man the\r\npictured remembrance of a former one: but wealth is the phoenix of\r\navarice, and therefore it cannot seek a new object, because there is not\r\nanother in the world.\r\n\r\nI now pass on to show the value of the present taxes, and compare them\r\nwith the annual expense; but this I shall preface with a few explanatory\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct things which make the payment of taxes difficult;\r\nthe one is the large and real value of the sum to be paid, and the other\r\nis the scarcity of the thing in which the payment is to be made; and\r\nalthough these appear to be one and the same, they are in several\r\ninstances riot only different, but the difficulty springs from different\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nSuppose a tax to be laid equal to one half of what a man's yearly income\r\nis, such a tax could not be paid, because the property could not be\r\nspared; and on the other hand, suppose a very trifling tax was laid, to\r\nbe collected in pearls, such a tax likewise could not be paid, because\r\nthey could not be had. Now any person may see that these are distinct\r\ncases, and the latter of them is a representation of our own.\r\n\r\nThat the difficulty cannot proceed from the former, that is, from the\r\nreal value or weight of the tax, is evident at the first view to any\r\nperson who will consider it.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the quota of taxes for this State for the year, 1780, (and\r\nso in proportion for every other State,) is twenty millions of dollars,\r\nwhich at seventy for one, is but sixty-four thousand two hundred and\r\neighty pounds three shillings sterling, and on an average, is no more\r\nthan three shillings and five pence sterling per head, per annum, per\r\nman, woman and child, or threepence two-fifths per head per month. Now\r\nhere is a clear, positive fact, that cannot be contradicted, and which\r\nproves that the difficulty cannot be in the weight of the tax, for in\r\nitself it is a trifle, and far from being adequate to our quota of the\r\nexpense of the war. The quit-rents of one penny sterling per acre on\r\nonly one half of the state, come to upwards of fifty thousand pounds,\r\nwhich is almost as much as all the taxes of the present year, and\r\nas those quit-rents made no part of the taxes then paid, and are now\r\ndiscontinued, the quantity of money drawn for public-service this year,\r\nexclusive of the militia fines, which I shall take notice of in the\r\nprocess of this work, is less than what was paid and payable in any year\r\npreceding the revolution, and since the last war; what I mean is, that\r\nthe quit-rents and taxes taken together came to a larger sum then, than\r\nthe present taxes without the quit-rents do now.\r\n\r\nMy intention by these arguments and calculations is to place the\r\ndifficulty to the right cause, and show that it does not proceed from\r\nthe weight or worth of the tax, but from the scarcity of the medium in\r\nwhich it is paid; and to illustrate this point still further, I shall\r\nnow show, that if the tax of twenty millions of dollars was of four\r\ntimes the real value it now is, or nearly so, which would be about two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, and would be our full quota,\r\nthis sum would have been raised with more ease, and have been less felt,\r\nthan the present sum of only sixty-four thousand two hundred and eighty\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe convenience or inconvenience of paying a tax in money arises from\r\nthe quantity of money that can be spared out of trade.\r\n\r\nWhen the emissions stopped, the continent was left in possession of\r\ntwo hundred millions of dollars, perhaps as equally dispersed as it was\r\npossible for trade to do it. And as no more was to be issued, the rise\r\nor fall of prices could neither increase nor diminish the quantity. It\r\ntherefore remained the same through all the fluctuations of trade and\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\nNow had the exchange stood at twenty for one, which was the rate\r\nCongress calculated upon when they arranged the quota of the several\r\nstates, the latter end of last year, trade would have been carried on\r\nfor nearly four times less money than it is now, and consequently the\r\ntwenty millions would have been spared with much greater ease, and when\r\ncollected would have been of almost four times the value that they now\r\nare. And on the other hand, was the depreciation to be ninety or one\r\nhundred for one, the quantity required for trade would be more than at\r\nsixty or seventy for one, and though the value of them would be less,\r\nthe difficulty of sparing the money out of trade would be greater. And\r\non these facts and arguments I rest the matter, to prove that it is\r\nnot the want of property, but the scarcity of the medium by which the\r\nproportion of property for taxation is to be measured out, that makes\r\nthe embarrassment which we lie under. There is not money enough, and,\r\nwhat is equally as true, the people will not let there be money enough.\r\n\r\nWhile I am on the subject of the currency, I shall offer one remark\r\nwhich will appear true to everybody, and can be accounted for by nobody,\r\nwhich is, that the better the times were, the worse the money grew;\r\nand the worse the times were, the better the money stood. It never\r\ndepreciated by any advantage obtained by the enemy. The troubles of\r\n1776, and the loss of Philadelphia in 1777, made no sensible impression\r\non it, and every one knows that the surrender of Charleston did not\r\nproduce the least alteration in the rate of exchange, which, for long\r\nbefore, and for more than three months after, stood at sixty for one. It\r\nseems as if the certainty of its being our own, made us careless of its\r\nvalue, and that the most distant thoughts of losing it made us hug\r\nit the closer, like something we were loth to part with; or that we\r\ndepreciate it for our pastime, which, when called to seriousness by the\r\nenemy, we leave off to renew again at our leisure. In short, our good\r\nluck seems to break us, and our bad makes us whole.\r\n\r\nPassing on from this digression, I shall now endeavor to bring into one\r\nview the several parts which I have already stated, and form thereon\r\nsome propositions, and conclude.\r\n\r\nI have placed before the reader, the average tax per head, paid by the\r\npeople of England; which is forty shillings sterling.\r\n\r\nAnd I have shown the rate on an average per head, which will defray\r\nall the expenses of the war to us, and support the several governments\r\nwithout running the country into debt, which is thirteen shillings and\r\nfour pence.\r\n\r\nI have shown what the peace establishment may be conducted for, viz., an\r\neighth part of what it would be, if under the government of Britain.\r\n\r\nAnd I have likewise shown what the average per head of the present\r\ntaxes is, namely, three shillings and fivepence sterling, or threepence\r\ntwo-fifths per month; and that their whole yearly value, in sterling,\r\nis only sixty-four thousand two hundred and eighty pounds. Whereas our\r\nquota, to keep the payments equal with the expenses, is two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand pounds. Consequently, there is a deficiency of one\r\nhundred and eighty-five thousand seven hundred and twenty pounds, and\r\nthe same proportion of defect, according to the several quotas, happens\r\nin every other state. And this defect is the cause why the army has been\r\nso indifferently fed, clothed and paid. It is the cause, likewise, of\r\nthe nerveless state of the campaign, and the insecurity of the country.\r\nNow, if a tax equal to thirteen and fourpence per head, will remove all\r\nthese difficulties, and make people secure in their homes, leave them to\r\nfollow the business of their stores and farms unmolested, and not only\r\ndrive out but keep out the enemy from the country; and if the neglect of\r\nraising this sum will let them in, and produce the evils which might be\r\nprevented--on which side, I ask, does the wisdom, interest and policy\r\nlie? Or, rather, would it not be an insult to reason, to put the\r\nquestion? The sum, when proportioned out according to the several\r\nabilities of the people, can hurt no one, but an inroad from the enemy\r\nruins hundreds of families.\r\n\r\nLook at the destruction done in this city [Philadelphia]. The many\r\nhouses totally destroyed, and others damaged; the waste of fences in\r\nthe country round it, besides the plunder of furniture, forage,\r\nand provisions. I do not suppose that half a million sterling would\r\nreinstate the sufferers; and, does this, I ask, bear any proportion to\r\nthe expense that would make us secure? The damage, on an average, is\r\nat least ten pounds sterling per head, which is as much as thirteen\r\nshillings and fourpence per head comes to for fifteen years. The same\r\nhas happened on the frontiers, and in the Jerseys, New York, and other\r\nplaces where the enemy has been--Carolina and Georgia are likewise\r\nsuffering the same fate.\r\n\r\nThat the people generally do not understand the insufficiency of the\r\ntaxes to carry on the war, is evident, not only from common observation,\r\nbut from the construction of several petitions which were presented to\r\nthe Assembly of this state, against the recommendation of Congress of\r\nthe 18th of March last, for taking up and funding the present currency\r\nat forty to one, and issuing new money in its stead. The prayer of the\r\npetition was, that the currency might be appreciated by taxes (meaning\r\nthe present taxes) and that part of the taxes be applied to the support\r\nof the army, if the army could not be otherwise supported. Now it could\r\nnot have been possible for such a petition to have been presented,\r\nhad the petitioners known, that so far from part of the taxes being\r\nsufficient for the support of the whole of them falls three-fourths\r\nshort of the year's expenses.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to propose methods by which a sufficiency of money\r\nmay be raised, I shall take a short view of the general state of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the weight of the war, the ravages of the enemy, and the\r\nobstructions she has thrown in the way of trade and commerce, so soon\r\ndoes a young country outgrow misfortune, that America has already\r\nsurmounted many that heavily oppressed her. For the first year or two\r\nof the war, we were shut up within our ports, scarce venturing to look\r\ntowards the ocean. Now our rivers are beautified with large and valuable\r\nvessels, our stores filled with merchandise, and the produce of the\r\ncountry has a ready market, and an advantageous price. Gold and silver,\r\nthat for a while seemed to have retreated again within the bowels of\r\nthe earth, have once more risen into circulation, and every day adds new\r\nstrength to trade, commerce and agriculture. In a pamphlet, written\r\nby Sir John Dalrymple, and dispersed in America in the year 1775, he\r\nasserted that two twenty-gun ships, nay, says he, tenders of those\r\nships, stationed between Albermarle sound and Chesapeake bay, would shut\r\nup the trade of America for 600 miles. How little did Sir John Dalrymple\r\nknow of the abilities of America!\r\n\r\nWhile under the government of Britain, the trade of this country was\r\nloaded with restrictions. It was only a few foreign ports which we were\r\nallowed to sail to. Now it is otherwise; and allowing that the quantity\r\nof trade is but half what it was before the war, the case must show the\r\nvast advantage of an open trade, because the present quantity under her\r\nrestrictions could not support itself; from which I infer, that if half\r\nthe quantity without the restrictions can bear itself up nearly, if not\r\nquite, as well as the whole when subject to them, how prosperous must\r\nthe condition of America be when the whole shall return open with all\r\nthe world. By the trade I do not mean the employment of a merchant only,\r\nbut the whole interest and business of the country taken collectively.\r\n\r\nIt is not so much my intention, by this publication, to propose\r\nparticular plans for raising money, as it is to show the necessity and\r\nthe advantages to be derived from it. My principal design is to form the\r\ndisposition of the people to the measures which I am fully persuaded it\r\nis their interest and duty to adopt, and which need no other force to\r\naccomplish them than the force of being felt. But as every hint may\r\nbe useful, I shall throw out a sketch, and leave others to make such\r\nimprovements upon it as to them may appear reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe annual sum wanted is two millions, and the average rate in which it\r\nfalls, is thirteen shillings and fourpence per head.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, that we raise half the sum and sixty thousand pounds\r\nover. The average rate thereof will be seven shillings per head.\r\n\r\nIn this case we shall have half the supply that we want, and an annual\r\nfund of sixty thousand pounds whereon to borrow the other million;\r\nbecause sixty thousand pounds is the interest of a million at six per\r\ncent.; and if at the end of another year we should be obliged, by the\r\ncontinuance of the war, to borrow another million, the taxes will be\r\nincreased to seven shillings and sixpence; and thus for every million\r\nborrowed, an additional tax, equal to sixpence per head, must be levied.\r\n\r\nThe sum to be raised next year will be one million and sixty thousand\r\npounds: one half of which I would propose should be raised by duties on\r\nimported goods, and prize goods, and the other half by a tax on landed\r\nproperty and houses, or such other means as each state may devise.\r\n\r\nBut as the duties on imports and prize goods must be the same in all the\r\nstates, therefore the rate per cent., or what other form the duty shall\r\nbe laid, must be ascertained and regulated by Congress, and ingrafted in\r\nthat form into the law of each state; and the monies arising therefrom\r\ncarried into the treasury of each state. The duties to be paid in gold\r\nor silver.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why a duty on imports is the most convenient\r\nduty or tax that can be collected; one of which is, because the whole is\r\npayable in a few places in a country, and it likewise operates with the\r\ngreatest ease and equality, because as every one pays in proportion to\r\nwhat he consumes, so people in general consume in proportion to what\r\nthey can afford; and therefore the tax is regulated by the abilities\r\nwhich every man supposes himself to have, or in other words, every man\r\nbecomes his own assessor, and pays by a little at a time, when it suits\r\nhim to buy. Besides, it is a tax which people may pay or let alone\r\nby not consuming the articles; and though the alternative may have no\r\ninfluence on their conduct, the power of choosing is an agreeable thing\r\nto the mind. For my own part, it would be a satisfaction to me was there\r\na duty on all sorts of liquors during the war, as in my idea of things\r\nit would be an addition to the pleasures of society to know, that when\r\nthe health of the army goes round, a few drops, from every glass becomes\r\ntheirs. How often have I heard an emphatical wish, almost accompanied by\r\na tear, \"Oh, that our poor fellows in the field had some of this!\" Why\r\nthen need we suffer under a fruitless sympathy, when there is a way to\r\nenjoy both the wish and the entertainment at once.\r\n\r\nBut the great national policy of putting a duty upon imports is, that it\r\neither keeps the foreign trade in our own hands, or draws something for\r\nthe defence of the country from every foreigner who participates in it\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nThus much for the first half of the taxes, and as each state will best\r\ndevise means to raise the other half, I shall confine my remarks to the\r\nresources of this state.\r\n\r\nThe quota, then, of this state, of one million and sixty thousand\r\npounds, will be one hundred and thirty-three thousand two hundred and\r\nfifty pounds, the half of which is sixty-six thousand six hundred\r\nand twenty-five pounds; and supposing one fourth part of Pennsylvania\r\ninhabited, then a tax of one bushel of wheat on every twenty acres of\r\nland, one with another, would produce the sum, and all the present taxes\r\nto cease. Whereas, the tithes of the bishops and clergy in England,\r\nexclusive of the taxes, are upwards of half a bushel of wheat on every\r\nsingle acre of land, good and bad, throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the former part of this paper, I mentioned the militia fines, but\r\nreserved speaking of the matter, which I shall now do. The ground I\r\nshall put it upon is, that two millions sterling a year will support\r\na sufficient army, and all the expenses of war and government, without\r\nhaving recourse to the inconvenient method of continually calling men\r\nfrom their employments, which, of all others, is the most expensive and\r\nthe least substantial. I consider the revenues created by taxes as the\r\nfirst and principal thing, and fines only as secondary and accidental\r\nthings. It was not the intention of the militia law to apply the fines\r\nto anything else but the support of the militia, neither do they produce\r\nany revenue to the state, yet these fines amount to more than all the\r\ntaxes: for taking the muster-roll to be sixty thousand men, the fine\r\non forty thousand who may not attend, will be sixty thousand pounds\r\nsterling, and those who muster, will give up a portion of time equal\r\nto half that sum, and if the eight classes should be called within the\r\nyear, and one third turn out, the fine on the remaining forty thousand\r\nwould amount to seventy-two millions of dollars, besides the fifteen\r\nshillings on every hundred pounds of property, and the charge of seven\r\nand a half per cent. for collecting, in certain instances which, on\r\nthe whole, would be upwards of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nNow if those very fines disable the country from raising a sufficient\r\nrevenue without producing an equivalent advantage, would it not be for\r\nthe ease and interest of all parties to increase the revenue, in the\r\nmanner I have proposed, or any better, if a better can be devised, and\r\ncease the operation of the fines? I would still keep the militia as an\r\norganized body of men, and should there be a real necessity to call them\r\nforth, pay them out of the proper revenues of the state, and increase\r\nthe taxes a third or fourth per cent. on those who do not attend. My\r\nlimits will not allow me to go further into this matter, which I shall\r\ntherefore close with this remark; that fines are, of all modes of\r\nrevenue, the most unsuited to the minds of a free country. When a\r\nman pays a tax, he knows that the public necessity requires it, and\r\ntherefore feels a pride in discharging his duty; but a fine seems\r\nan atonement for neglect of duty, and of consequence is paid with\r\ndiscredit, and frequently levied with severity.\r\n\r\nI have now only one subject more to speak of, with which I shall\r\nconclude, which is, the resolve of Congress of the 18th of March last,\r\nfor taking up and funding the present currency at forty for one, and\r\nissuing new money in its stead.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that I am not the flatterer of Congress, but in this\r\ninstance they are right; and if that measure is supported, the currency\r\nwill acquire a value, which, without it, it will not. But this is not\r\nall: it will give relief to the finances until such time as they can be\r\nproperly arranged, and save the country from being immediately doubled\r\ntaxed under the present mode. In short, support that measure, and it\r\nwill support you.\r\n\r\nI have now waded through a tedious course of difficult business, and\r\nover an untrodden path. The subject, on every point in which it could be\r\nviewed, was entangled with perplexities, and enveloped in obscurity, yet\r\nsuch are the resources of America, that she wants nothing but system to\r\nsecure success.\r\n\r\n                                          COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Oct. 4, 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS X. ON THE KING OF ENGLAND'S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF all the innocent passions which actuate the human mind there is none\r\nmore universally prevalent than curiosity. It reaches all mankind, and\r\nin matters which concern us, or concern us not, it alike provokes in us\r\na desire to know them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the situation of America, superior to every effort to enslave\r\nher, and daily rising to importance and opulence, has placed her above\r\nthe region of anxiety, it has still left her within the circle of\r\ncuriosity; and her fancy to see the speech of a man who had proudly\r\nthreatened to bring her to his feet, was visibly marked with that\r\ntranquil confidence which cared nothing about its contents. It was\r\ninquired after with a smile, read with a laugh, and dismissed with\r\ndisdain.\r\n\r\nBut, as justice is due, even to an enemy, it is right to say, that the\r\nspeech is as well managed as the embarrassed condition of their affairs\r\ncould well admit of; and though hardly a line of it is true, except the\r\nmournful story of Cornwallis, it may serve to amuse the deluded commons\r\nand people of England, for whom it was calculated.\r\n\r\n\"The war,\" says the speech, \"is still unhappily prolonged by that\r\nrestless ambition which first excited our enemies to commence it, and\r\nwhich still continues to disappoint my earnest wishes and diligent\r\nexertions to restore the public tranquillity.\"\r\n\r\nHow easy it is to abuse truth and language, when men, by habitual\r\nwickedness, have learned to set justice at defiance. That the very man\r\nwho began the war, who with the most sullen insolence refused to answer,\r\nand even to hear the humblest of all petitions, who has encouraged\r\nhis officers and his army in the most savage cruelties, and the most\r\nscandalous plunderings, who has stirred up the Indians on one side, and\r\nthe negroes on the other, and invoked every aid of hell in his behalf,\r\nshould now, with an affected air of pity, turn the tables from himself,\r\nand charge to another the wickedness that is his own, can only be\r\nequalled by the baseness of the heart that spoke it.\r\n\r\nTo be nobly wrong is more manly than to be meanly right, is an\r\nexpression I once used on a former occasion, and it is equally\r\napplicable now. We feel something like respect for consistency even in\r\nerror. We lament the virtue that is debauched into a vice, but the\r\nvice that affects a virtue becomes the more detestable: and amongst the\r\nvarious assumptions of character, which hypocrisy has taught, and men\r\nhave practised, there is none that raises a higher relish of disgust,\r\nthan to see disappointed inveteracy twisting itself, by the most visible\r\nfalsehoods, into an appearance of piety which it has no pretensions to.\r\n\r\n\"But I should not,\" continues the speech, \"answer the trust committed\r\nto the sovereign of a free people, nor make a suitable return to my\r\nsubjects for their constant, zealous, and affectionate attachment to my\r\nperson, family and government, if I consented to sacrifice, either to\r\nmy own desire of peace, or to their temporary ease and relief, those\r\nessential rights and permanent interests, upon the maintenance and\r\npreservation of which, the future strength and security of this country\r\nmust principally depend.\"\r\n\r\nThat the man whose ignorance and obstinacy first involved and still\r\ncontinues the nation in the most hopeless and expensive of all wars,\r\nshould now meanly flatter them with the name of a free people, and make\r\na merit of his crime, under the disguise of their essential rights and\r\npermanent interests, is something which disgraces even the character of\r\nperverseness. Is he afraid they will send him to Hanover, or what does\r\nhe fear? Why is the sycophant thus added to the hypocrite, and the man\r\nwho pretends to govern, sunk into the humble and submissive memorialist?\r\n\r\nWhat those essential rights and permanent interests are, on which the\r\nfuture strength and security of England must principally depend, are not\r\nso much as alluded to. They are words which impress nothing but the ear,\r\nand are calculated only for the sound.\r\n\r\nBut if they have any reference to America, then do they amount to\r\nthe disgraceful confession, that England, who once assumed to be her\r\nprotectress, has now become her dependant. The British king and ministry\r\nare constantly holding up the vast importance which America is of\r\nto England, in order to allure the nation to carry on the war: now,\r\nwhatever ground there is for this idea, it ought to have operated as a\r\nreason for not beginning it; and, therefore, they support their present\r\nmeasures to their own disgrace, because the arguments which they now\r\nuse, are a direct reflection on their former policy.\r\n\r\n\"The favorable appearance of affairs,\" continues the speech, \"in the\r\nEast Indies, and the safe arrival of the numerous commercial fleets of\r\nmy kingdom, must have given you satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nThat things are not quite so bad every where as in America may be some\r\ncause of consolation, but can be none for triumph. One broken leg\r\nis better than two, but still it is not a source of joy: and let the\r\nappearance of affairs in the East Indies be ever so favorable, they are\r\nnevertheless worse than at first, without a prospect of their ever being\r\nbetter. But the mournful story of Cornwallis was yet to be told, and it\r\nwas necessary to give it the softest introduction possible.\r\n\r\n\"But in the course of this year,\" continues the speech, \"my assiduous\r\nendeavors to guard the extensive dominions of my crown have not been\r\nattended with success equal to the justice and uprightness of my\r\nviews.\"--What justice and uprightness there was in beginning a war with\r\nAmerica, the world will judge of, and the unequalled barbarity with\r\nwhich it has been conducted, is not to be worn from the memory by the\r\ncant of snivelling hypocrisy.\r\n\r\n\"And it is with great concern that I inform you that the events of war\r\nhave been very unfortunate to my arms in Virginia, having ended in the\r\nloss of my forces in that province.\"--And our great concern is that they\r\nare not all served in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\"No endeavors have been wanted on my part,\" says the speech, \"to\r\nextinguish that spirit of rebellion which our enemies have found means\r\nto foment and maintain in the colonies; and to restore to my deluded\r\nsubjects in America that happy and prosperous condition which they\r\nformerly derived from a due obedience to the laws.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression of deluded subjects is become so hacknied and\r\ncontemptible, and the more so when we see them making prisoners of whole\r\narmies at a time, that the pride of not being laughed at would induce a\r\nman of common sense to leave it off. But the most offensive falsehood\r\nin the paragraph is the attributing the prosperity of America to a\r\nwrong cause. It was the unremitted industry of the settlers and their\r\ndescendants, the hard labor and toil of persevering fortitude, that\r\nwere the true causes of the prosperity of America. The former tyranny\r\nof England served to people it, and the virtue of the adventurers to\r\nimprove it. Ask the man, who, with his axe, has cleared a way in the\r\nwilderness, and now possesses an estate, what made him rich, and he will\r\ntell you the labor of his hands, the sweat of his brow, and the blessing\r\nof heaven. Let Britain but leave America to herself and she asks no\r\nmore. She has risen into greatness without the knowledge and against the\r\nwill of England, and has a right to the unmolested enjoyment of her own\r\ncreated wealth.\r\n\r\n\"I will order,\" says the speech, \"the estimates of the ensuing year to\r\nbe laid before you. I rely on your wisdom and public spirit for such\r\nsupplies as the circumstances of our affairs shall be found to require.\r\nAmong the many ill consequences which attend the continuation of the\r\npresent war, I most sincerely regret the additional burdens which it\r\nmust unavoidably bring upon my faithful subjects.\"\r\n\r\nIt is strange that a nation must run through such a labyrinth of\r\ntrouble, and expend such a mass of wealth to gain the wisdom which an\r\nhour's reflection might have taught. The final superiority of America\r\nover every attempt that an island might make to conquer her, was as\r\nnaturally marked in the constitution of things, as the future ability of\r\na giant over a dwarf is delineated in his features while an infant.\r\nHow far providence, to accomplish purposes which no human wisdom could\r\nforesee, permitted such extraordinary errors, is still a secret in the\r\nwomb of time, and must remain so till futurity shall give it birth.\r\n\r\n\"In the prosecution of this great and important contest,\" says the\r\nspeech, \"in which we are engaged, I retain a firm confidence in the\r\nprotection of divine providence, and a perfect conviction in the justice\r\nof my cause, and I have no doubt, but, that by the concurrence and\r\nsupport of my Parliament, by the valour of my fleets and armies, and by\r\na vigorous, animated, and united exertion of the faculties and resources\r\nof my people, I shall be enabled to restore the blessings of a safe and\r\nhonorable peace to all my dominions.\"\r\n\r\nThe King of England is one of the readiest believers in the world. In\r\nthe beginning of the contest he passed an act to put America out of the\r\nprotection of the crown of England, and though providence, for seven\r\nyears together, has put him out of her protection, still the man has no\r\ndoubt. Like Pharaoh on the edge of the Red Sea, he sees not the plunge\r\nhe is making, and precipitately drives across the flood that is closing\r\nover his head.\r\n\r\nI think it is a reasonable supposition, that this part of the speech was\r\ncomposed before the arrival of the news of the capture of Cornwallis:\r\nfor it certainly has no relation to their condition at the time it was\r\nspoken. But, be this as it may, it is nothing to us. Our line is\r\nfixed. Our lot is cast; and America, the child of fate, is arriving at\r\nmaturity. We have nothing to do but by a spirited and quick exertion,\r\nto stand prepared for war or peace. Too great to yield, and too noble\r\nto insult; superior to misfortune, and generous in success, let us\r\nuntaintedly preserve the character which we have gained, and show to\r\nfuture ages an example of unequalled magnanimity. There is something in\r\nthe cause and consequence of America that has drawn on her the attention\r\nof all mankind. The world has seen her brave. Her love of liberty; her\r\nardour in supporting it; the justice of her claims, and the constancy\r\nof her fortitude have won her the esteem of Europe, and attached to her\r\ninterest the first power in that country.\r\n\r\nHer situation now is such, that to whatever point, past, present or to\r\ncome, she casts her eyes, new matter rises to convince her that she is\r\nright. In her conduct towards her enemy, no reproachful sentiment lurks\r\nin secret. No sense of injustice is left upon the mind. Untainted with\r\nambition, and a stranger to revenge, her progress has been marked by\r\nprovidence, and she, in every stage of the conflict, has blest her with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBut let not America wrap herself up in delusive hope and suppose the\r\nbusiness done. The least remissness in preparation, the least relaxation\r\nin execution, will only serve to prolong the war, and increase\r\nexpenses. If our enemies can draw consolation from misfortune, and\r\nexert themselves upon despair, how much more ought we, who are to win a\r\ncontinent by the conquest, and have already an earnest of success?\r\n\r\nHaving, in the preceding part, made my remarks on the several matters\r\nwhich the speech contains, I shall now make my remarks on what it does\r\nnot contain.\r\n\r\nThere is not a syllable in its respecting alliances. Either the\r\ninjustice of Britain is too glaring, or her condition too desperate, or\r\nboth, for any neighboring power to come to her support. In the beginning\r\nof the contest, when she had only America to contend with, she hired\r\nassistance from Hesse, and other smaller states of Germany, and\r\nfor nearly three years did America, young, raw, undisciplined and\r\nunprovided, stand against the power of Britain, aided by twenty thousand\r\nforeign troops, and made a complete conquest of one entire army. The\r\nremembrance of those things ought to inspire us with confidence and\r\ngreatness of mind, and carry us through every remaining difficulty with\r\ncontent and cheerfulness. What are the little sufferings of the present\r\nday, compared with the hardships that are past? There was a time, when\r\nwe had neither house nor home in safety; when every hour was the hour of\r\nalarm and danger; when the mind, tortured with anxiety, knew no repose,\r\nand every thing, but hope and fortitude, was bidding us farewell.\r\n\r\nIt is of use to look back upon these things; to call to mind the times\r\nof trouble and the scenes of complicated anguish that are past and gone.\r\nThen every expense was cheap, compared with the dread of conquest and\r\nthe misery of submission. We did not stand debating upon trifles, or\r\ncontending about the necessary and unavoidable charges of defence. Every\r\none bore his lot of suffering, and looked forward to happier days, and\r\nscenes of rest.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the greatest dangers which any country can be exposed\r\nto, arises from a kind of trifling which sometimes steals upon the mind,\r\nwhen it supposes the danger past; and this unsafe situation marks at\r\nthis time the peculiar crisis of America. What would she once have given\r\nto have known that her condition at this day should be what it now is?\r\nAnd yet we do not seem to place a proper value upon it, nor vigorously\r\npursue the necessary measures to secure it. We know that we cannot be\r\ndefended, nor yet defend ourselves, without trouble and expense. We have\r\nno right to expect it; neither ought we to look for it. We are a people,\r\nwho, in our situation, differ from all the world. We form one common\r\nfloor of public good, and, whatever is our charge, it is paid for our\r\nown interest and upon our own account.\r\n\r\nMisfortune and experience have now taught us system and method; and the\r\narrangements for carrying on the war are reduced to rule and order. The\r\nquotas of the several states are ascertained, and I intend in a future\r\npublication to show what they are, and the necessity as well as the\r\nadvantages of vigorously providing for them.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I shall conclude this paper with an instance of\r\nBritish clemency, from Smollett's History of England, vol. xi., printed\r\nin London. It will serve to show how dismal the situation of a conquered\r\npeople is, and that the only security is an effectual defence.\r\n\r\nWe all know that the Stuart family and the house of Hanover opposed each\r\nother for the crown of England. The Stuart family stood first in the\r\nline of succession, but the other was the most successful.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1745, Charles, the son of the exiled king, landed in Scotland,\r\ncollected a small force, at no time exceeding five or six thousand\r\nmen, and made some attempts to re-establish his claim. The late Duke of\r\nCumberland, uncle to the present King of England, was sent against him,\r\nand on the 16th of April following, Charles was totally defeated at\r\nCulloden, in Scotland. Success and power are the only situations in\r\nwhich clemency can be shown, and those who are cruel, because they\r\nare victorious, can with the same facility act any other degenerate\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after the decisive action at Culloden, the Duke of\r\nCumberland took possession of Inverness; where six and thirty deserters,\r\nconvicted by a court martial, were ordered to be executed: then he\r\ndetached several parties to ravage the country. One of these apprehended\r\nThe Lady Mackintosh, who was sent prisoner to Inverness, plundered her\r\nhouse, and drove away her cattle, though her husband was actually in the\r\nservice of the government. The castle of Lord Lovat was destroyed.\r\nThe French prisoners were sent to Carlisle and Penrith: Kilmarnock,\r\nBalmerino, Cromartie, and his son, The Lord Macleod, were conveyed by\r\nsea to London; and those of an inferior rank were confined in different\r\nprisons. The Marquis of Tullibardine, together with a brother of the\r\nEarl of Dunmore, and Murray, the pretender's secretary, were seized and\r\ntransported to the Tower of London, to which the Earl of Traquaire\r\nhad been committed on suspicion; and the eldest son of Lord Lovat was\r\nimprisoned in the castle of Edinburgh. In a word, all the jails in\r\nGreat Britain, from the capital, northwards, were filled with those\r\nunfortunate captives; and great numbers of them were crowded together in\r\nthe holds of ships, where they perished in the most deplorable manner,\r\nfor want of air and exercise. Some rebel chiefs escaped in two French\r\nfrigates that arrived on the coast of Lochaber about the end of April,\r\nand engaged three vessels belonging to his Britannic majesty, which\r\nthey obliged to retire. Others embarked on board a ship on the coast\r\nof Buchan, and were conveyed to Norway, from whence they travelled to\r\nSweden. In the month of May, the Duke of Cumberland advanced with the\r\narmy into the Highlands, as far as Fort Augustus, where he encamped; and\r\nsent off detachments on all hands, to hunt down the fugitives, and\r\nlay waste the country with fire and sword. The castles of Glengary and\r\nLochiel were plundered and burned; every house, hut, or habitation,\r\nmet with the same fate, without distinction; and all the cattle and\r\nprovision were carried off; the men were either shot upon the mountains,\r\nlike wild beasts, or put to death in cold blood, without form of trial;\r\nthe women, after having seen their husbands and fathers murdered, were\r\nsubjected to brutal violation, and then turned out naked, with their\r\nchildren, to starve on the barren heaths. One whole family was enclosed\r\nin a barn, and consumed to ashes. Those ministers of vengeance were so\r\nalert in the execution of their office, that in a few days there was\r\nneither house, cottage, man, nor beast, to be seen within the compass of\r\nfifty miles; all was ruin, silence, and desolation.\"\r\n\r\nI have here presented the reader with one of the most shocking instances\r\nof cruelty ever practised, and I leave it, to rest on his mind, that he\r\nmay be fully impressed with a sense of the destruction he has escaped,\r\nin case Britain had conquered America; and likewise, that he may see\r\nand feel the necessity, as well for his own personal safety, as for the\r\nhonor, the interest, and happiness of the whole community, to omit or\r\ndelay no one preparation necessary to secure the ground which we so\r\nhappily stand upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TO THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n          On the expenses, arrangements and disbursements for\r\n           carrying on the war, and finishing it with honor\r\n                            and advantage\r\n\r\nWHEN any necessity or occasion has pointed out the convenience of\r\naddressing the public, I have never made it a consideration whether the\r\nsubject was popular or unpopular, but whether it was right or wrong; for\r\nthat which is right will become popular, and that which is wrong, though\r\nby mistake it may obtain the cry or fashion of the day, will soon lose\r\nthe power of delusion, and sink into disesteem.\r\n\r\nA remarkable instance of this happened in the case of Silas Deane; and\r\nI mention this circumstance with the greater ease, because the poison\r\nof his hypocrisy spread over the whole country, and every man, almost\r\nwithout exception, thought me wrong in opposing him. The best friends\r\nI then had, except Mr. [Henry] Laurens, stood at a distance, and this\r\ntribute, which is due to his constancy, I pay to him with respect, and\r\nthat the readier, because he is not here to hear it. If it reaches him\r\nin his imprisonment, it will afford him an agreeable reflection.\r\n\r\n\"As he rose like a rocket, he would fall like a stick,\" is a metaphor\r\nwhich I applied to Mr. Deane, in the first piece which I published\r\nrespecting him, and he has exactly fulfilled the description. The credit\r\nhe so unjustly obtained from the public, he lost in almost as short a\r\ntime. The delusion perished as it fell, and he soon saw himself stripped\r\nof popular support. His more intimate acquaintances began to doubt, and\r\nto desert him long before he left America, and at his departure, he saw\r\nhimself the object of general suspicion. When he arrived in France,\r\nhe endeavored to effect by treason what he had failed to accomplish by\r\nfraud. His plans, schemes and projects, together with his expectation of\r\nbeing sent to Holland to negotiate a loan of money, had all miscarried.\r\nHe then began traducing and accusing America of every crime, which could\r\ninjure her reputation. \"That she was a ruined country; that she only\r\nmeant to make a tool of France, to get what money she could out of her,\r\nand then to leave her and accommodate with Britain.\" Of all which and\r\nmuch more, Colonel Laurens and myself, when in France, informed Dr.\r\nFranklin, who had not before heard of it. And to complete the character\r\nof traitor, he has, by letters to his country since, some of which, in\r\nhis own handwriting, are now in the possession of Congress, used every\r\nexpression and argument in his power, to injure the reputation of\r\nFrance, and to advise America to renounce her alliance, and surrender up\r\nher independence.* Thus in France he abuses America, and in his letters\r\nto America he abuses France; and is endeavoring to create disunion\r\nbetween two countries, by the same arts of double-dealing by which he\r\ncaused dissensions among the commissioners in Paris, and distractions in\r\nAmerica. But his life has been fraud, and his character has been that of\r\na plodding, plotting, cringing mercenary, capable of any disguise that\r\nsuited his purpose. His final detection has very happily cleared up\r\nthose mistakes, and removed that uneasiness, which his unprincipled\r\nconduct occasioned. Every one now sees him in the same light; for\r\ntowards friends or enemies he acted with the same deception and\r\ninjustice, and his name, like that of Arnold, ought now to be forgotten\r\namong us. As this is the first time that I have mentioned him since my\r\nreturn from France, it is my intention that it shall be the last. From\r\nthis digression, which for several reasons I thought necessary to give,\r\nI now proceed to the purport of my address.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Mr. William Marshall, of this city [Philadelphia], formerly a\r\npilot, who had been taken at sea and carried to England, and got from\r\nthence to France, brought over letters from Mr. Deane to America, one of\r\nwhich was directed to \"Robert Morris, Esq.\" Mr. Morris sent it unopened\r\nto Congress, and advised Mr. Marshall to deliver the others there, which\r\nhe did. The letters were of the same purport with those which have been\r\nalready published under the signature of S. Deane, to which they had\r\nfrequent reference.\r\n\r\nI consider the war of America against Britain as the country's war,\r\nthe public's war, or the war of the people in their own behalf, for\r\nthe security of their natural rights, and the protection of their own\r\nproperty. It is not the war of Congress, the war of the assemblies, or\r\nthe war of government in any line whatever. The country first, by\r\nmutual compact, resolved to defend their rights and maintain their\r\nindependence, at the hazard of their lives and fortunes; they elected\r\ntheir representatives, by whom they appointed their members of Congress,\r\nand said, act you for us, and we will support you. This is the\r\ntrue ground and principle of the war on the part of America, and,\r\nconsequently, there remains nothing to do, but for every one to fulfil\r\nhis obligation.\r\n\r\nIt was next to impossible that a new country, engaged in a new\r\nundertaking, could set off systematically right at first. She saw not\r\nthe extent of the struggle that she was involved in, neither could she\r\navoid the beginning. She supposed every step that she took, and every\r\nresolution which she formed, would bring her enemy to reason and close\r\nthe contest. Those failing, she was forced into new measures; and these,\r\nlike the former, being fitted to her expectations, and failing in their\r\nturn, left her continually unprovided, and without system. The\r\nenemy, likewise, was induced to prosecute the war, from the temporary\r\nexpedients we adopted for carrying it on. We were continually expecting\r\nto see their credit exhausted, and they were looking to see our currency\r\nfail; and thus, between their watching us, and we them, the hopes of\r\nboth have been deceived, and the childishness of the expectation has\r\nserved to increase the expense.\r\n\r\nYet who, through this wilderness of error, has been to blame? Where is\r\nthe man who can say the fault, in part, has not been his? They were the\r\nnatural, unavoidable errors of the day. They were the errors of a whole\r\ncountry, which nothing but experience could detect and time remove.\r\nNeither could the circumstances of America admit of system, till either\r\nthe paper currency was fixed or laid aside. No calculation of a finance\r\ncould be made on a medium failing without reason, and fluctuating\r\nwithout rule.\r\n\r\nBut there is one error which might have been prevented and was not; and\r\nas it is not my custom to flatter, but to serve mankind, I will speak it\r\nfreely. It certainly was the duty of every assembly on the continent to\r\nhave known, at all times, what was the condition of its treasury, and\r\nto have ascertained at every period of depreciation, how much the real\r\nworth of the taxes fell short of their nominal value. This knowledge,\r\nwhich might have been easily gained, in the time of it, would have\r\nenabled them to have kept their constituents well informed, and this is\r\none of the greatest duties of representation. They ought to have studied\r\nand calculated the expenses of the war, the quota of each state, and\r\nthe consequent proportion that would fall on each man's property for\r\nhis defence; and this must have easily shown to them, that a tax of one\r\nhundred pounds could not be paid by a bushel of apples or an hundred of\r\nflour, which was often the case two or three years ago. But instead of\r\nthis, which would have been plain and upright dealing, the little line\r\nof temporary popularity, the feather of an hour's duration, was too much\r\npursued; and in this involved condition of things, every state, for the\r\nwant of a little thinking, or a little information, supposed that it\r\nsupported the whole expenses of the war, when in fact it fell, by the\r\ntime the tax was levied and collected, above three-fourths short of its\r\nown quota.\r\n\r\nImpressed with a sense of the danger to which the country was exposed by\r\nthis lax method of doing business, and the prevailing errors of the day,\r\nI published, last October was a twelvemonth, the Crisis Extraordinary,\r\non the revenues of America, and the yearly expense of carrying on\r\nthe war. My estimation of the latter, together with the civil list of\r\nCongress, and the civil list of the several states, was two million\r\npounds sterling, which is very nearly nine millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nSince that time, Congress have gone into a calculation, and have\r\nestimated the expenses of the War Department and the civil list of\r\nCongress (exclusive of the civil list of the several governments) at\r\neight millions of dollars; and as the remaining million will be\r\nfully sufficient for the civil list of the several states, the two\r\ncalculations are exceedingly near each other.\r\n\r\nThe sum of eight millions of dollars have called upon the states to\r\nfurnish, and their quotas are as follows, which I shall preface with the\r\nresolution itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             \"By the United States in Congress assembled.\r\n\r\n                          \"October 30, 1781.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the respective states be called upon to furnish the\r\ntreasury of the United States with their quotas of eight millions of\r\ndollars, for the War Department and civil list for the ensuing year, to\r\nbe paid quarterly, in equal proportions, the first payment to be made on\r\nthe first day of April next.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That a committee, consisting of a member from each state, be\r\nappointed to apportion to the several states the quota of the above sum.\r\n\r\n\"November 2d. The committee appointed to ascertain the proportions of\r\nthe several states of the monies to be raised for the expenses of the\r\nensuing year, report the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"That the sum of eight millions of dollars, as required to be raised by\r\nthe resolutions of the 30th of October last, be paid by the states in\r\nthe following proportion:\r\n\r\n               New Hampshire....... $  373,598\r\n               Massachusetts.......  1,307,596\r\n               Rhode Island........    216,684\r\n               Connecticut.........    747,196\r\n               New York............    373,598\r\n               New Jersey..........    485,679\r\n               Pennsylvania........  1,120,794\r\n               Delaware............    112,085\r\n               Maryland............    933,996\r\n               Virginia............  1,307,594\r\n               North Carolina......    622,677\r\n               South Carolina......    373,598\r\n               Georgia.............     24,905\r\n\r\n                                    $8,000,000\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That it be recommended to the several states, to lay taxes\r\nfor raising their quotas of money for the United States, separate from\r\nthose laid for their own particular use.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn these resolutions I shall offer several remarks.\r\n\r\n   1st, On the sum itself, and the ability of the country.\r\n   2d, On the several quotas, and the nature of a union. And,\r\n   3d, On the manner of collection and expenditure.\r\n\r\n1st, On the sum itself, and the ability of the country. As I know my\r\nown calculation is as low as possible, and as the sum called for by\r\ncongress, according to their calculation, agrees very nearly therewith,\r\nI am sensible it cannot possibly be lower. Neither can it be done for\r\nthat, unless there is ready money to go to market with; and even in that\r\ncase, it is only by the utmost management and economy that it can be\r\nmade to do.\r\n\r\nBy the accounts which were laid before the British Parliament last\r\nspring, it appeared that the charge of only subsisting, that is, feeding\r\ntheir army in America, cost annually four million pounds sterling, which\r\nis very nearly eighteen millions of dollars. Now if, for eight millions,\r\nwe can feed, clothe, arm, provide for, and pay an army sufficient for\r\nour defence, the very comparison shows that the money must be well laid\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt may be of some use, either in debate or conversation, to attend to\r\nthe progress of the expenses of an army, because it will enable us to\r\nsee on what part any deficiency will fall.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is, to feed them and prepare for the sick.\r\n\r\n  _Second_, to clothe them.\r\n  _Third_, to arm and furnish them.\r\n  _Fourth_, to provide means for removing them from place to place. And,\r\n  _Fifth_, to pay them.\r\n\r\nThe first and second are absolutely necessary to them as men. The third\r\nand fourth are equally as necessary to them as an army. And the fifth is\r\ntheir just due. Now if the sum which shall be raised should fall short,\r\neither by the several acts of the states for raising it, or by the\r\nmanner of collecting it, the deficiency will fall on the fifth head, the\r\nsoldiers' pay, which would be defrauding them, and eternally disgracing\r\nourselves. It would be a blot on the councils, the country, and the\r\nrevolution of America, and a man would hereafter be ashamed to own that\r\nhe had any hand in it.\r\n\r\nBut if the deficiency should be still shorter, it would next fall on the\r\nfourth head, the means of removing the army from place to place; and, in\r\nthis case, the army must either stand still where it can be of no use,\r\nor seize on horses, carts, wagons, or any means of transportation which\r\nit can lay hold of; and in this instance the country suffers. In short,\r\nevery attempt to do a thing for less than it can he done for, is sure to\r\nbecome at last both a loss and a dishonor.\r\n\r\nBut the country cannot bear it, say some. This has been the most\r\nexpensive doctrine that ever was held out, and cost America millions\r\nof money for nothing. Can the country bear to be overrun, ravaged,\r\nand ruined by an enemy? This will immediately follow where defence is\r\nwanting, and defence will ever be wanting, where sufficient revenues\r\nare not provided. But this is only one part of the folly. The second is,\r\nthat when the danger comes, invited in part by our not preparing against\r\nit, we have been obliged, in a number of instances, to expend double the\r\nsums to do that which at first might have been done for half the money.\r\nBut this is not all. A third mischief has been, that grain of all sorts,\r\nflour, beef fodder, horses, carts, wagons, or whatever was absolutely or\r\nimmediately wanted, have been taken without pay. Now, I ask, why was all\r\nthis done, but from that extremely weak and expensive doctrine, that\r\nthe country could not bear it? That is, that she could not bear, in the\r\nfirst instance, that which would have saved her twice as much at last;\r\nor, in proverbial language, that she could not bear to pay a penny to\r\nsave a pound; the consequence of which has been, that she has paid a\r\npound for a penny. Why are there so many unpaid certificates in almost\r\nevery man's hands, but from the parsimony of not providing sufficient\r\nrevenues? Besides, the doctrine contradicts itself; because, if the\r\nwhole country cannot bear it, how is it possible that a part should?\r\nAnd yet this has been the case: for those things have been had; and they\r\nmust be had; but the misfortune is, that they have been obtained in\r\na very unequal manner, and upon expensive credit, whereas, with ready\r\nmoney, they might have been purchased for half the price, and nobody\r\ndistressed.\r\n\r\nBut there is another thought which ought to strike us, which is, how is\r\nthe army to bear the want of food, clothing and other necessaries? The\r\nman who is at home, can turn himself a thousand ways, and find as many\r\nmeans of ease, convenience or relief: but a soldier's life admits of\r\nnone of those: their wants cannot be supplied from themselves: for an\r\narmy, though it is the defence of a state, is at the same time the child\r\nof a country, or must be provided for in every thing.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the doctrine is false. There are not three millions of\r\npeople in any part of the universe, who live so well, or have such a\r\nfund of ability, as in America. The income of a common laborer, who is\r\nindustrious, is equal to that of the generality of tradesmen in England.\r\nIn the mercantile line, I have not heard of one who could be said to be\r\na bankrupt since the war began, and in England they have been without\r\nnumber. In America almost every farmer lives on his own lands, and in\r\nEngland not one in a hundred does. In short, it seems as if the poverty\r\nof that country had made them furious, and they were determined to risk\r\nall to recover all.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding those advantages on the part of America, true it\r\nis, that had it not been for the operation of taxes for our necessary\r\ndefence, we had sunk into a state of sloth and poverty: for there was\r\nmore wealth lost by neglecting to till the earth in the years 1776,\r\n'77, and '78, than the quota of taxes amounts to. That which is lost by\r\nneglect of this kind, is lost for ever: whereas that which is paid, and\r\ncontinues in the country, returns to us again; and at the same time that\r\nit provides us with defence, it operates not only as a spur, but as a\r\npremium to our industry.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to the second head, viz., on the several quotas, and\r\nthe nature of a union.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when America had no other bond of union, than that of\r\ncommon interest and affection. The whole country flew to the relief of\r\nBoston, and, making her cause, their own, participated in her cares and\r\nadministered to her wants. The fate of war, since that day, has carried\r\nthe calamity in a ten-fold proportion to the southward; but in the mean\r\ntime the union has been strengthened by a legal compact of the states,\r\njointly and severally ratified, and that which before was choice, or the\r\nduty of affection, is now likewise the duty of legal obligation.\r\n\r\nThe union of America is the foundation-stone of her independence;\r\nthe rock on which it is built; and is something so sacred in her\r\nconstitution, that we ought to watch every word we speak, and every\r\nthought we think, that we injure it not, even by mistake. When a\r\nmultitude, extended, or rather scattered, over a continent in the manner\r\nwe were, mutually agree to form one common centre whereon the whole\r\nshall move to accomplish a particular purpose, all parts must act\r\ntogether and alike, or act not at all, and a stoppage in any one is a\r\nstoppage of the whole, at least for a time.\r\n\r\nThus the several states have sent representatives to assemble together\r\nin Congress, and they have empowered that body, which thus becomes their\r\ncentre, and are no other than themselves in representation, to conduct\r\nand manage the war, while their constituents at home attend to the\r\ndomestic cares of the country, their internal legislation, their farms,\r\nprofessions or employments, for it is only by reducing complicated\r\nthings to method and orderly connection that they can be understood\r\nwith advantage, or pursued with success. Congress, by virtue of this\r\ndelegation, estimates the expense, and apportions it out to the several\r\nparts of the empire according to their several abilities; and here the\r\ndebate must end, because each state has already had its voice, and the\r\nmatter has undergone its whole portion of argument, and can no more be\r\naltered by any particular state, than a law of any state, after it has\r\npassed, can be altered by any individual. For with respect to those\r\nthings which immediately concern the union, and for which the union was\r\npurposely established, and is intended to secure, each state is to the\r\nUnited States what each individual is to the state he lives in. And\r\nit is on this grand point, this movement upon one centre, that our\r\nexistence as a nation, our happiness as a people, and our safety as\r\nindividuals, depend.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that some state or other may be somewhat over or under\r\nrated, but this cannot be much. The experience which has been had upon\r\nthe matter, has nearly ascertained their several abilities. But even\r\nin this case, it can only admit of an appeal to the United States, but\r\ncannot authorise any state to make the alteration itself, any more than\r\nour internal government can admit an individual to do so in the case of\r\nan act of assembly; for if one state can do it, then may another do the\r\nsame, and the instant this is done the whole is undone.\r\n\r\nNeither is it supposable that any single state can be a judge of all the\r\ncomparative reasons which may influence the collective body in arranging\r\nthe quotas of the continent. The circumstances of the several states are\r\nfrequently varying, occasioned by the accidents of war and commerce, and\r\nit will often fall upon some to help others, rather beyond what their\r\nexact proportion at another time might be; but even this assistance is\r\nas naturally and politically included in the idea of a union as that of\r\nany particular assigned proportion; because we know not whose turn\r\nit may be next to want assistance, for which reason that state is the\r\nwisest which sets the best example.\r\n\r\nThough in matters of bounden duty and reciprocal affection, it is rather\r\na degeneracy from the honesty and ardor of the heart to admit any thing\r\nselfish to partake in the government of our conduct, yet in cases where\r\nour duty, our affections, and our interest all coincide, it may be of\r\nsome use to observe their union. The United States will become heir to\r\nan extensive quantity of vacant land, and their several titles to\r\nshares and quotas thereof, will naturally be adjusted according to their\r\nrelative quotas, during the war, exclusive of that inability which may\r\nunfortunately arise to any state by the enemy's holding possession of\r\na part; but as this is a cold matter of interest, I pass it by,\r\nand proceed to my third head, viz., on the manner of collection and\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nIt has been our error, as well as our misfortune, to blend the affairs\r\nof each state, especially in money matters, with those of the United\r\nStates; whereas it is our case, convenience and interest, to keep them\r\nseparate. The expenses of the United States for carrying on the war, and\r\nthe expenses of each state for its own domestic government, are distinct\r\nthings, and to involve them is a source of perplexity and a cloak for\r\nfraud. I love method, because I see and am convinced of its beauty and\r\nadvantage. It is that which makes all business easy and understood, and\r\nwithout which, everything becomes embarrassed and difficult.\r\n\r\nThere are certain powers which the people of each state have delegated\r\nto their legislative and executive bodies, and there are other powers\r\nwhich the people of every state have delegated to Congress, among\r\nwhich is that of conducting the war, and, consequently, of managing the\r\nexpenses attending it; for how else can that be managed, which concerns\r\nevery state, but by a delegation from each? When a state has furnished\r\nits quota, it has an undoubted right to know how it has been applied,\r\nand it is as much the duty of Congress to inform the state of the one,\r\nas it is the duty of the state to provide the other.\r\n\r\nIn the resolution of Congress already recited, it is recommended to the\r\nseveral states to lay taxes for raising their quotas of money for the\r\nUnited States, separate from those laid for their own particular use.\r\n\r\nThis is a most necessary point to be observed, and the distinction\r\nshould follow all the way through. They should be levied, paid and\r\ncollected, separately, and kept separate in every instance. Neither have\r\nthe civil officers of any state, nor the government of that state, the\r\nleast right to touch that money which the people pay for the support of\r\ntheir army and the war, any more than Congress has to touch that which\r\neach state raises for its own use.\r\n\r\nThis distinction will naturally be followed by another. It will occasion\r\nevery state to examine nicely into the expenses of its civil list, and\r\nto regulate, reduce, and bring it into better order than it has hitherto\r\nbeen; because the money for that purpose must be raised apart, and\r\naccounted for to the public separately. But while the, monies of both\r\nwere blended, the necessary nicety was not observed, and the poor\r\nsoldier, who ought to have been the first, was the last who was thought\r\nof.\r\n\r\nAnother convenience will be, that the people, by paying the taxes\r\nseparately, will know what they are for; and will likewise know that\r\nthose which are for the defence of the country will cease with the war,\r\nor soon after. For although, as I have before observed, the war is their\r\nown, and for the support of their own rights and the protection of their\r\nown property, yet they have the same right to know, that they have\r\nto pay, and it is the want of not knowing that is often the cause of\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis regulation of keeping the taxes separate has given rise to a\r\nregulation in the office of finance, by which it is directed:\r\n\r\n\"That the receivers shall, at the end of every month, make out an exact\r\naccount of the monies received by them respectively, during such month,\r\nspecifying therein the names of the persons from whom the same shall\r\nhave been received, the dates and the sums; which account they shall\r\nrespectively cause to be published in one of the newspapers of the\r\nstate; to the end that every citizen may know how much of the monies\r\ncollected from him, in taxes, is transmitted to the treasury of the\r\nUnited States for the support of the war; and also, that it may be known\r\nwhat monies have been at the order of the superintendent of finance. It\r\nbeing proper and necessary, that, in a free country, the people should\r\nbe as fully informed of the administration of their affairs as the\r\nnature of things will admit.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an agreeable thing to see a spirit of order and economy taking\r\nplace, after such a series of errors and difficulties. A government or\r\nan administration, who means and acts honestly, has nothing to fear, and\r\nconsequently has nothing to conceal; and it would be of use if a monthly\r\nor quarterly account was to be published, as well of the expenditures\r\nas of the receipts. Eight millions of dollars must be husbanded with an\r\nexceeding deal of care to make it do, and, therefore, as the management\r\nmust be reputable, the publication would be serviceable.\r\n\r\nI have heard of petitions which have been presented to the assembly of\r\nthis state (and probably the same may have happened in other states)\r\npraying to have the taxes lowered. Now the only way to keep taxes low\r\nis, for the United States to have ready money to go to market with: and\r\nthough the taxes to be raised for the present year will fall heavy,\r\nand there will naturally be some difficulty in paying them, yet the\r\ndifficulty, in proportion as money spreads about the country, will every\r\nday grow less, and in the end we shall save some millions of dollars by\r\nit. We see what a bitter, revengeful enemy we have to deal with, and\r\nany expense is cheap compared to their merciless paw. We have seen the\r\nunfortunate Carolineans hunted like partridges on the mountains, and it\r\nis only by providing means for our defence, that we shall be kept from\r\nthe same condition. When we think or talk about taxes, we ought to\r\nrecollect that we lie down in peace and sleep in safety; that we\r\ncan follow our farms or stores or other occupations, in prosperous\r\ntranquillity; and that these inestimable blessings are procured to us\r\nby the taxes that we pay. In this view, our taxes are properly our\r\ninsurance money; they are what we pay to be made safe, and, in strict\r\npolicy, are the best money we can lay out.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to offer some remarks on the impost law of five per\r\ncent. recommended by Congress, and to be established as a fund for the\r\npayment of the loan-office certificates, and other debts of the United\r\nStates; but I have already extended my piece beyond my intention. And\r\nas this fund will make our system of finance complete, and is strictly\r\njust, and consequently requires nothing but honesty to do it, there\r\nneeds but little to be said upon it.\r\n\r\n                                              COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, March 5, 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS. XI. ON THE PRESENT STATE OF NEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE the arrival of two, if not three packets in quick succession, at\r\nNew York, from England, a variety of unconnected news has circulated\r\nthrough the country, and afforded as great a variety of speculation.\r\n\r\nThat something is the matter in the cabinet and councils of our enemies,\r\non the other side of the water, is certain--that they have run their\r\nlength of madness, and are under the necessity of changing their\r\nmeasures may easily be seen into; but to what this change of measures\r\nmay amount, or how far it may correspond with our interest, happiness\r\nand duty, is yet uncertain; and from what we have hitherto experienced,\r\nwe have too much reason to suspect them in every thing. I do not address\r\nthis publication so much to the people of America as to the British\r\nministry, whoever they may be, for if it is their intention to promote\r\nany kind of negotiation, it is proper they should know beforehand, that\r\nthe United States have as much honor as bravery; and that they are no\r\nmore to be seduced from their alliance than their allegiance; that their\r\nline of politics is formed and not dependent, like that of their enemy,\r\non chance and accident. On our part, in order to know, at any time, what\r\nthe British government will do, we have only to find out what they ought\r\nnot to do, and this last will be their conduct. Forever changing and\r\nforever wrong; too distant from America to improve in circumstances, and\r\ntoo unwise to foresee them; scheming without principle, and executing\r\nwithout probability, their whole line of management has hitherto been\r\nblunder and baseness. Every campaign has added to their loss, and every\r\nyear to their disgrace; till unable to go on, and ashamed to go back,\r\ntheir politics have come to a halt, and all their fine prospects to a\r\nhalter.\r\n\r\nCould our affections forgive, or humanity forget the wounds of an\r\ninjured country--we might, under the influence of a momentary oblivion,\r\nstand still and laugh. But they are engraven where no amusement can\r\nconceal them, and of a kind for which there is no recompense. Can ye\r\nrestore to us the beloved dead? Can ye say to the grave, give up the\r\nmurdered? Can ye obliterate from our memories those who are no more?\r\nThink not then to tamper with our feelings by an insidious contrivance,\r\nnor suffocate our humanity by seducing us to dishonor.\r\n\r\nIn March 1780, I published part of the Crisis, No. VIII., in the\r\nnewspapers, but did not conclude it in the following papers, and the\r\nremainder has lain by me till the present day. There appeared about\r\nthat time some disposition in the British cabinet to cease the further\r\nprosecution of the war, and as I had formed my opinion that whenever\r\nsuch a design should take place, it would be accompanied by a\r\ndishonorable proposition to America, respecting France, I had suppressed\r\nthe remainder of that number, not to expose the baseness of any such\r\nproposition. But the arrival of the next news from England, declared her\r\ndetermination to go on with the war, and consequently as the political\r\nobject I had then in view was not become a subject, it was unnecessary\r\nin me to bring it forward, which is the reason it was never published.\r\nThe matter which I allude to in the unpublished part, I shall now make a\r\nquotation of, and apply it as the more enlarged state of things, at this\r\nday, shall make convenient or necessary. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"By the speeches which have appeared from the British Parliament, it is\r\neasy to perceive to what impolitic and imprudent excesses their passions\r\nand prejudices have, in every instance, carried them during the present\r\nwar. Provoked at the upright and honorable treaty between America and\r\nFrance, they imagined that nothing more was necessary to be done to\r\nprevent its final ratification, than to promise, through the agency of\r\ntheir commissioners (Carlisle, Eden, and Johnstone) a repeal of their\r\nonce offensive acts of Parliament. The vanity of the conceit, was as\r\nunpardonable as the experiment was impolitic. And so convinced am I of\r\ntheir wrong ideas of America, that I shall not wonder, if, in their last\r\nstage of political frenzy, they propose to her to break her alliance\r\nwith France, and enter into one with them. Such a proposition, should\r\nit ever be made, and it has been already more than once hinted at in\r\nParliament, would discover such a disposition to perfidiousness, and\r\nsuch disregard of honor and morals, as would add the finishing vice to\r\nnational corruption.--I do not mention this to put America on the watch,\r\nbut to put England on her guard, that she do not, in the looseness of\r\nher heart, envelop in disgrace every fragment of reputation.\"--Thus far\r\nthe quotation.\r\n\r\nBy the complection of some part of the news which has transpired through\r\nthe New York papers, it seems probable that this insidious era in the\r\nBritish politics is beginning to make its appearance. I wish it may\r\nnot; for that which is a disgrace to human nature, throws something of a\r\nshade over all the human character, and each individual feels his share\r\nof the wound that is given to the whole. The policy of Britain has ever\r\nbeen to divide America in some way or other. In the beginning of the\r\ndispute, she practised every art to prevent or destroy the union of the\r\nstates, well knowing that could she once get them to stand singly, she\r\ncould conquer them unconditionally. Failing in this project in America,\r\nshe renewed it in Europe; and, after the alliance had taken place, she\r\nmade secret offers to France to induce her to give up America; and what\r\nis still more extraordinary, she at the same time made propositions to\r\nDr. Franklin, then in Paris, the very court to which she was secretly\r\napplying, to draw off America from France. But this is not all. On the\r\n14th of September, 1778, the British court, through their secretary,\r\nLord Weymouth, made application to the Marquis d'Almadovar, the Spanish\r\nambassador at London, to \"ask the mediation,\" for these were the words,\r\nof the court of Spain, for the purpose of negotiating a peace with\r\nFrance, leaving America (as I shall hereafter show) out of the question.\r\nSpain readily offered her mediation, and likewise the city of Madrid as\r\nthe place of conference, but withal, proposed, that the United States of\r\nAmerica should be invited to the treaty, and considered as independent\r\nduring the time the business was negotiating. But this was not the\r\nview of England. She wanted to draw France from the war, that she might\r\nuninterruptedly pour out all her force and fury upon America; and being\r\ndisappointed in this plan, as well through the open and generous conduct\r\nof Spain, as the determination of France, she refused the mediation\r\nwhich she had solicited. I shall now give some extracts from the\r\njustifying memorial of the Spanish court, in which she has set the\r\nconduct and character of Britain, with respect to America, in a clear\r\nand striking point of light.\r\n\r\nThe memorial, speaking of the refusal of the British court to meet in\r\nconference with commissioners from the United States, who were to be\r\nconsidered as independent during the time of the conference, says,\r\n\r\n\"It is a thing very extraordinary and even ridiculous, that the court of\r\nLondon, who treats the colonies as independent, not only in acting, but\r\nof right, during the war, should have a repugnance to treat them as\r\nsuch only in acting during a truce, or suspension of hostilities.\r\nThe convention of Saratoga; the reputing General Burgoyne as a lawful\r\nprisoner, in order to suspend his trial; the exchange and liberation of\r\nother prisoners made from the colonies; the having named commissioners\r\nto go and supplicate the Americans, at their own doors, request peace of\r\nthem, and treat with them and the Congress: and, finally, by a thousand\r\nother acts of this sort, authorized by the court of London, which have\r\nbeen, and are true signs of the acknowledgment of their independence.\r\n\r\n\"In aggravation of all the foregoing, at the same time the British\r\ncabinet answered the King of Spain in the terms already mentioned, they\r\nwere insinuating themselves at the court of France by means of secret\r\nemissaries, and making very great offers to her, to abandon the colonies\r\nand make peace with England. But there is yet more; for at this same\r\ntime the English ministry were treating, by means of another certain\r\nemissary, with Dr. Franklin, minister plenipotentiary from the colonies,\r\nresiding at Paris, to whom they made various proposals to disunite them\r\nfrom France, and accommodate matters with England.\r\n\r\n\"From what has been observed, it evidently follows, that the whole\r\nof the British politics was, to disunite the two courts of Paris and\r\nMadrid, by means of the suggestions and offers which she separately\r\nmade to them; and also to separate the colonies from their treaties and\r\nengagements entered into with France, and induce them to arm against the\r\nhouse of Bourbon, or more probably to oppress them when they found,\r\nfrom breaking their engagements, that they stood alone and without\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\"This, therefore, is the net they laid for the American states; that is\r\nto say, to tempt them with flattering and very magnificent promises to\r\ncome to an accommodation with them, exclusive of any intervention of\r\nSpain or France, that the British ministry might always remain the\r\narbiters of the fate of the colonies. But the Catholic king (the King\r\nof Spain) faithful on the one part of the engagements which bind him\r\nto the Most Christian king (the King of France) his nephew; just and\r\nupright on the other, to his own subjects, whom he ought to protect\r\nand guard against so many insults; and finally, full of humanity and\r\ncompassion for the Americans and other individuals who suffer in the\r\npresent war; he is determined to pursue and prosecute it, and to make\r\nall the efforts in his power, until he can obtain a solid and permanent\r\npeace, with full and satisfactory securities that it shall be observed.\"\r\n\r\nThus far the memorial; a translation of which into English, may be seen\r\nin full, under the head of State Papers, in the Annual Register, for\r\n1779.\r\n\r\nThe extracts I have here given, serve to show the various endeavors\r\nand contrivances of the enemy, to draw France from her connection with\r\nAmerica, and to prevail on her to make a separate peace with England,\r\nleaving America totally out of the question, and at the mercy of a\r\nmerciless, unprincipled enemy. The opinion, likewise, which Spain\r\nhas formed of the British cabinet's character for meanness and\r\nperfidiousness, is so exactly the opinion of America respecting it,\r\nthat the memorial, in this instance, contains our own statements and\r\nlanguage; for people, however remote, who think alike, will unavoidably\r\nspeak alike.\r\n\r\nThus we see the insidious use which Britain endeavored to make of the\r\npropositions of peace under the mediation of Spain. I shall now proceed\r\nto the second proposition under the mediation of the Emperor of Germany\r\nand the Empress of Russia; the general outline of which was, that a\r\ncongress of the several powers at war should meet at Vienna, in 1781,\r\nto settle preliminaries of peace. I could wish myself at liberty to make\r\nuse of all the information which I am possessed of on this subject, but\r\nas there is a delicacy in the matter, I do not conceive it prudent, at\r\nleast at present, to make references and quotations in the same manner\r\nas I have done with respect to the mediation of Spain, who published the\r\nwhole proceedings herself; and therefore, what comes from me, on this\r\npart of the business, must rest on my own credit with the public,\r\nassuring them, that when the whole proceedings, relative to the proposed\r\nCongress of Vienna shall appear, they will find my account not only\r\ntrue, but studiously moderate.\r\n\r\nWe know at the time this mediation was on the carpet, the expectation of\r\nthe British king and ministry ran high with respect to the conquest of\r\nAmerica. The English packet which was taken with the mail on board,\r\nand carried into l'Orient, in France, contained letters from Lord G.\r\nGermaine to Sir Henry Clinton, which expressed in the fullest terms the\r\nministerial idea of a total conquest. Copies of those letters were sent\r\nto congress and published in the newspapers of last year. Colonel\r\n[John] Laurens brought over the originals, some of which, signed in the\r\nhandwriting of the then secretary, Germaine, are now in my possession.\r\n\r\nFilled with these high ideas, nothing could be more insolent towards\r\nAmerica than the language of the British court on the proposed\r\nmediation. A peace with France and Spain she anxiously solicited; but\r\nAmerica, as before, was to be left to her mercy, neither would she hear\r\nany proposition for admitting an agent from the United States into the\r\ncongress of Vienna.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, France, with an open, noble and manly determination,\r\nand a fidelity of a good ally, would hear no proposition for a separate\r\npeace, nor even meet in congress at Vienna, without an agent from\r\nAmerica: and likewise that the independent character of the United\r\nStates, represented by the agent, should be fully and unequivocally\r\ndefined and settled before any conference should be entered on. The\r\nreasoning of the court of France on the several propositions of the\r\ntwo imperial courts, which relate to us, is rather in the style of an\r\nAmerican than an ally, and she advocated the cause of America as if she\r\nhad been America herself.--Thus the second mediation, like the first,\r\nproved ineffectual. But since that time, a reverse of fortune has\r\novertaken the British arms, and all their high expectations are dashed\r\nto the ground. The noble exertions to the southward under General\r\n[Nathaniel] Greene; the successful operations of the allied arms in the\r\nChesapeake; the loss of most of their islands in the West Indies, and\r\nMinorca in the Mediterranean; the persevering spirit of Spain against\r\nGibraltar; the expected capture of Jamaica; the failure of making a\r\nseparate peace with Holland, and the expense of an hundred millions\r\nsterling, by which all these fine losses were obtained, have read them\r\na loud lesson of disgraceful misfortune and necessity has called on them\r\nto change their ground.\r\n\r\nIn this situation of confusion and despair, their present councils have\r\nno fixed character. It is now the hurricane months of British politics.\r\nEvery day seems to have a storm of its own, and they are scudding under\r\nthe bare poles of hope. Beaten, but not humble; condemned, but not\r\npenitent; they act like men trembling at fate and catching at a straw.\r\nFrom this convulsion, in the entrails of their politics, it is more than\r\nprobable, that the mountain groaning in labor, will bring forth a mouse,\r\nas to its size, and a monster in its make. They will try on America the\r\nsame insidious arts they tried on France and Spain.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes experience sensations to which language is not equal.\r\nThe conception is too bulky to be born alive, and in the torture of\r\nthinking, we stand dumb. Our feelings, imprisoned by their magnitude,\r\nfind no way out--and, in the struggle of expression, every finger tries\r\nto be a tongue. The machinery of the body seems too little for the mind,\r\nand we look about for helps to show our thoughts by. Such must be the\r\nsensation of America, whenever Britain, teeming with corruption, shall\r\npropose to her to sacrifice her faith.\r\n\r\nBut, exclusive of the wickedness, there is a personal offence contained\r\nin every such attempt. It is calling us villains: for no man asks the\r\nother to act the villain unless he believes him inclined to be one.\r\nNo man attempts to seduce the truly honest woman. It is the supposed\r\nlooseness of her mind that starts the thoughts of seduction, and he who\r\noffers it calls her a prostitute. Our pride is always hurt by the same\r\npropositions which offend our principles; for when we are shocked at the\r\ncrime, we are wounded by the suspicion of our compliance.\r\n\r\nCould I convey a thought that might serve to regulate the public mind,\r\nI would not make the interest of the alliance the basis of defending\r\nit. All the world are moved by interest, and it affords them nothing to\r\nboast of. But I would go a step higher, and defend it on the ground of\r\nhonor and principle. That our public affairs have flourished under the\r\nalliance--that it was wisely made, and has been nobly executed--that by\r\nits assistance we are enabled to preserve our country from conquest, and\r\nexpel those who sought our destruction--that it is our true interest to\r\nmaintain it unimpaired, and that while we do so no enemy can conquer\r\nus, are matters which experience has taught us, and the common good of\r\nourselves, abstracted from principles of faith and honor, would lead us\r\nto maintain the connection.\r\n\r\nBut over and above the mere letter of the alliance, we have been nobly\r\nand generously treated, and have had the same respect and attention paid\r\nto us, as if we had been an old established country. To oblige and\r\nbe obliged is fair work among mankind, and we want an opportunity of\r\nshowing to the world that we are a people sensible of kindness and\r\nworthy of confidence. Character is to us, in our present circumstances,\r\nof more importance than interest. We are a young nation, just stepping\r\nupon the stage of public life, and the eye of the world is upon us\r\nto see how we act. We have an enemy who is watching to destroy our\r\nreputation, and who will go any length to gain some evidence against\r\nus, that may serve to render our conduct suspected, and our character\r\nodious; because, could she accomplish this, wicked as it is, the world\r\nwould withdraw from us, as from a people not to be trusted, and our task\r\nwould then become difficult. There is nothing which sets the character\r\nof a nation in a higher or lower light with others, than the faithfully\r\nfulfilling, or perfidiously breaking, of treaties. They are things not\r\nto be tampered with: and should Britain, which seems very probable,\r\npropose to seduce America into such an act of baseness, it would\r\nmerit from her some mark of unusual detestation. It is one of those\r\nextraordinary instances in which we ought not to be contented with the\r\nbare negative of Congress, because it is an affront on the multitude as\r\nwell as on the government. It goes on the supposition that the public\r\nare not honest men, and that they may be managed by contrivance, though\r\nthey cannot be conquered by arms. But, let the world and Britain know,\r\nthat we are neither to be bought nor sold; that our mind is great and\r\nfixed; our prospect clear; and that we will support our character as\r\nfirmly as our independence.\r\n\r\nBut I will go still further; General Conway, who made the motion, in\r\nthe British Parliament, for discontinuing offensive war in America, is a\r\ngentleman of an amiable character. We have no personal quarrel with him.\r\nBut he feels not as we feel; he is not in our situation, and that alone,\r\nwithout any other explanation, is enough. The British Parliament suppose\r\nthey have many friends in America, and that, when all chance of conquest\r\nis over, they will be able to draw her from her alliance with France.\r\nNow, if I have any conception of the human heart, they will fail in this\r\nmore than in any thing that they have yet tried.\r\n\r\nThis part of the business is not a question of policy only, but of honor\r\nand honesty; and the proposition will have in it something so visibly\r\nlow and base, that their partisans, if they have any, will be ashamed of\r\nit. Men are often hurt by a mean action who are not startled at a wicked\r\none, and this will be such a confession of inability, such a declaration\r\nof servile thinking, that the scandal of it will ruin all their hopes.\r\n\r\nIn short, we have nothing to do but to go on with vigor and\r\ndetermination. The enemy is yet in our country. They hold New York,\r\nCharleston, and Savannah, and the very being in those places is an\r\noffence, and a part of offensive war, and until they can be driven from\r\nthem, or captured in them, it would be folly in us to listen to an idle\r\ntale. I take it for granted that the British ministry are sinking under\r\nthe impossibility of carrying on the war. Let them then come to a fair\r\nand open peace with France, Spain, Holland and America, in the manner\r\nthey ought to do; but until then, we can have nothing to say to them.\r\n\r\n                                     COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\n                    PHILADELPHIA, May 22, 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A SUPERNUMERARY CRISIS\r\n\r\n                         TO SIR GUY CARLETON.\r\n\r\nIT is the nature of compassion to associate with misfortune; and I\r\naddress this to you in behalf even of an enemy, a captain in the British\r\nservice, now on his way to the headquarters of the American army, and\r\nunfortunately doomed to death for a crime not his own. A sentence so\r\nextraordinary, an execution so repugnant to every human sensation, ought\r\nnever to be told without the circumstances which produced it: and as the\r\ndestined victim is yet in existence, and in your hands rests his life or\r\ndeath, I shall briefly state the case, and the melancholy consequence.\r\n\r\nCaptain Huddy, of the Jersey militia, was attacked in a small fort on\r\nTom's River, by a party of refugees in the British pay and service, was\r\nmade prisoner, together with his company, carried to New York and lodged\r\nin the provost of that city: about three weeks after which, he was taken\r\nout of the provost down to the water-side, put into a boat, and brought\r\nagain upon the Jersey shore, and there, contrary to the practice of all\r\nnations but savages, was hung up on a tree, and left hanging till found\r\nby our people who took him down and buried him. The inhabitants of that\r\npart of the country where the murder was committed, sent a deputation\r\nto General Washington with a full and certified statement of the fact.\r\nStruck, as every human breast must be, with such brutish outrage, and\r\ndetermined both to punish and prevent it for the future, the General\r\nrepresented the case to General Clinton, who then commanded, and\r\ndemanded that the refugee officer who ordered and attended the\r\nexecution, and whose name is Lippencott, should be delivered up as\r\na murderer; and in case of refusal, that the person of some British\r\nofficer should suffer in his stead. The demand, though not refused, has\r\nnot been complied with; and the melancholy lot (not by selection, but by\r\ncasting lots) has fallen upon Captain Asgill, of the Guards, who, as I\r\nhave already mentioned, is on his way from Lancaster to camp, a\r\nmartyr to the general wickedness of the cause he engaged in, and the\r\ningratitude of those whom he served.\r\n\r\nThe first reflection which arises on this black business is, what sort\r\nof men must Englishmen be, and what sort of order and discipline do\r\nthey preserve in their army, when in the immediate place of their\r\nheadquarters, and under the eye and nose of their commander-in-chief,\r\na prisoner can be taken at pleasure from his confinement, and his death\r\nmade a matter of sport.\r\n\r\nThe history of the most savage Indians does not produce instances\r\nexactly of this kind. They, at least, have a formality in their\r\npunishments. With them it is the horridness of revenge, but with your\r\narmy it is a still greater crime, the horridness of diversion. The\r\nBritish generals who have succeeded each other, from the time of General\r\nGage to yourself, have all affected to speak in language that they have\r\nno right to. In their proclamations, their addresses, their letters\r\nto General Washington, and their supplications to Congress (for they\r\ndeserve no other name) they talk of British honor, British generosity,\r\nand British clemency, as if those things were matters of fact; whereas,\r\nwe whose eyes are open, who speak the same language with yourselves,\r\nmany of whom were born on the same spot with you, and who can no more\r\nbe mistaken in your words than in your actions, can declare to all the\r\nworld, that so far as our knowledge goes, there is not a more detestable\r\ncharacter, nor a meaner or more barbarous enemy, than the present\r\nBritish one. With us, you have forfeited all pretensions to reputation,\r\nand it is only by holding you like a wild beast, afraid of your keepers,\r\nthat you can be made manageable. But to return to the point in question.\r\n\r\nThough I can think no man innocent who has lent his hand to destroy\r\nthe country which he did not plant, and to ruin those that he could not\r\nenslave, yet, abstracted from all ideas of right and wrong on the\r\noriginal question, Captain Asgill, in the present case, is not the\r\nguilty man. The villain and the victim are here separated characters.\r\nYou hold the one and we the other. You disown, or affect to disown and\r\nreprobate the conduct of Lippincut, yet you give him a sanctuary; and by\r\nso doing you as effectually become the executioner of Asgill, as if you\r\nhad put the rope on his neck, and dismissed him from the world. Whatever\r\nyour feelings on this interesting occasion may be are best known to\r\nyourself. Within the grave of your own mind lies buried the fate of\r\nAsgill. He becomes the corpse of your will, or the survivor of your\r\njustice. Deliver up the one, and you save the other; withhold the one,\r\nand the other dies by your choice.\r\n\r\nOn our part the case is exceeding plain; an officer has been taken from\r\nhis confinement and murdered, and the murderer is within your lines.\r\nYour army has been guilty of a thousand instances of equal cruelty,\r\nbut they have been rendered equivocal, and sheltered from personal\r\ndetection. Here the crime is fixed; and is one of those extraordinary\r\ncases which can neither be denied nor palliated, and to which the custom\r\nof war does not apply; for it never could be supposed that such a brutal\r\noutrage would ever be committed. It is an original in the history\r\nof civilized barbarians, and is truly British. On your part you are\r\naccountable to us for the personal safety of the prisoners within your\r\nwalls. Here can be no mistake; they can neither be spies nor suspected\r\nas such; your security is not endangered, nor your operations subjected\r\nto miscarriage, by men immured within a dungeon. They differ in every\r\ncircumstance from men in the field, and leave no pretence for severity\r\nof punishment. But if to the dismal condition of captivity with you must\r\nbe added the constant apprehensions of death; if to be imprisoned is\r\nso nearly to be entombed; and if, after all, the murderers are to be\r\nprotected, and thereby the crime encouraged, wherein do you differ from\r\n[American] Indians either in conduct or character?\r\n\r\nWe can have no idea of your honor, or your justice, in any future\r\ntransaction, of what nature it may be, while you shelter within your\r\nlines an outrageous murderer, and sacrifice in his stead an officer of\r\nyour own. If you have no regard to us, at least spare the blood which\r\nit is your duty to save. Whether the punishment will be greater on him,\r\nwho, in this case, innocently dies, or on him whom sad necessity forces\r\nto retaliate, is, in the nicety of sensation, an undecided question? It\r\nrests with you to prevent the sufferings of both. You have nothing to do\r\nbut to give up the murderer, and the matter ends.\r\n\r\nBut to protect him, be he who he may, is to patronize his crime, and to\r\ntrifle it off by frivolous and unmeaning inquiries, is to promote it.\r\nThere is no declaration you can make, nor promise you can give that will\r\nobtain credit. It is the man and not the apology that is demanded.\r\n\r\nYou see yourself pressed on all sides to spare the life of your own\r\nofficer, for die he will if you withhold justice. The murder of Captain\r\nHuddy is an offence not to be borne with, and there is no security which\r\nwe can have, that such actions or similar ones shall not be repeated,\r\nbut by making the punishment fall upon yourselves. To destroy the last\r\nsecurity of captivity, and to take the unarmed, the unresisting prisoner\r\nto private and sportive execution, is carrying barbarity too high for\r\nsilence. The evil must be put an end to; and the choice of persons rests\r\nwith you. But if your attachment to the guilty is stronger than to the\r\ninnocent, you invent a crime that must destroy your character, and if\r\nthe cause of your king needs to be so supported, for ever cease, sir,\r\nto torture our remembrance with the wretched phrases of British honor,\r\nBritish generosity and British clemency.\r\n\r\nFrom this melancholy circumstance, learn, sir, a lesson of morality. The\r\nrefugees are men whom your predecessors have instructed in wickedness,\r\nthe better to fit them to their master's purpose. To make them useful,\r\nthey have made them vile, and the consequence of their tutored villany\r\nis now descending on the heads of their encouragers. They have been\r\ntrained like hounds to the scent of blood, and cherished in every\r\nspecies of dissolute barbarity. Their ideas of right and wrong are\r\nworn away in the constant habitude of repeated infamy, till, like men\r\npractised in execution, they feel not the value of another's life.\r\n\r\nThe task before you, though painful, is not difficult; give up the\r\nmurderer, and save your officer, as the first outset of a necessary\r\nreformation.                                             COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA May 31, 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS. XII. TO THE EARL OF SHELBURNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY LORD,--A speech, which has been printed in several of the British and\r\nNew York newspapers, as coming from your lordship, in answer to one from\r\nthe Duke of Richmond, of the 10th of July last, contains expressions and\r\nopinions so new and singular, and so enveloped in mysterious reasoning,\r\nthat I address this publication to you, for the purpose of giving them a\r\nfree and candid examination. The speech I allude to is in these words:\r\n\r\n\"His lordship said, it had been mentioned in another place, that he had\r\nbeen guilty of inconsistency. To clear himself of this, he asserted that\r\nhe still held the same principles in respect to American independence\r\nwhich he at first imbibed. He had been, and yet was of opinion, whenever\r\nthe Parliament of Great Britain acknowledges that point, the sun of\r\nEngland's glory is set forever. Such were the sentiments he possessed on\r\na former day, and such the sentiments he continued to hold at this\r\nhour. It was the opinion of Lord Chatham, as well as many other able\r\nstatesmen. Other noble lords, however, think differently, and as the\r\nmajority of the cabinet support them, he acquiesced in the measure,\r\ndissenting from the idea; and the point is settled for bringing\r\nthe matter into the full discussion of Parliament, where it will be\r\ncandidly, fairly, and impartially debated. The independence of America\r\nwould end in the ruin of England; and that a peace patched up with\r\nFrance, would give that proud enemy the means of yet trampling on this\r\ncountry. The sun of England's glory he wished not to see set forever; he\r\nlooked for a spark at least to be left, which might in time light us\r\nup to a new day. But if independence was to be granted, if Parliament\r\ndeemed that measure prudent, he foresaw, in his own mind, that England\r\nwas undone. He wished to God that he had been deputed to Congress, that\r\nbe might plead the cause of that country as well as of this, and that he\r\nmight exercise whatever powers he possessed as an orator, to save both\r\nfrom ruin, in a conviction to Congress, that, if their independence was\r\nsigned, their liberties were gone forever.\r\n\r\n\"Peace, his lordship added, was a desirable object, but it must be an\r\nhonorable peace, and not an humiliating one, dictated by France, or\r\ninsisted on by America. It was very true, that this kingdom was not in a\r\nflourishing state, it was impoverished by war. But if we were not\r\nrich, it was evident that France was poor. If we were straitened in our\r\nfinances, the enemy were exhausted in their resources. This was a great\r\nempire; it abounded with brave men, who were able and willing to fight\r\nin a common cause; the language of humiliation should not, therefore, be\r\nthe language of Great Britain. His lordship said, that he was not afraid\r\nnor ashamed of those expressions going to America. There were numbers,\r\ngreat numbers there, who were of the same way of thinking, in respect\r\nto that country being dependent on this, and who, with his lordship,\r\nperceived ruin and independence linked together.\"\r\n\r\nThus far the speech; on which I remark--That his lordship is a total\r\nstranger to the mind and sentiments of America; that he has wrapped\r\nhimself up in fond delusion, that something less than independence, may,\r\nunder his administration, be accepted; and he wishes himself sent to\r\nCongress, to prove the most extraordinary of all doctrines, which is,\r\nthat independence, the sublimest of all human conditions, is loss of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nIn answer to which we may say, that in order to know what the contrary\r\nword dependence means, we have only to look back to those years of\r\nsevere humiliation, when the mildest of all petitions could obtain no\r\nother notice than the haughtiest of all insults; and when the base\r\nterms of unconditional submission were demanded, or undistinguishable\r\ndestruction threatened. It is nothing to us that the ministry have been\r\nchanged, for they may be changed again. The guilt of a government is\r\nthe crime of a whole country; and the nation that can, though but for\r\na moment, think and act as England has done, can never afterwards be\r\nbelieved or trusted. There are cases in which it is as impossible to\r\nrestore character to life, as it is to recover the dead. It is a phoenix\r\nthat can expire but once, and from whose ashes there is no resurrection.\r\nSome offences are of such a slight composition, that they reach no\r\nfurther than the temper, and are created or cured by a thought. But the\r\nsin of England has struck the heart of America, and nature has not left\r\nin our power to say we can forgive.\r\n\r\nYour lordship wishes for an opportunity to plead before Congress the\r\ncause of England and America, and to save, as you say, both from ruin.\r\n\r\nThat the country, which, for more than seven years has sought our\r\ndestruction, should now cringe to solicit our protection, is adding the\r\nwretchedness of disgrace to the misery of disappointment; and if England\r\nhas the least spark of supposed honor left, that spark must be darkened\r\nby asking, and extinguished by receiving, the smallest favor from\r\nAmerica; for the criminal who owes his life to the grace and mercy of\r\nthe injured, is more executed by living, than he who dies.\r\n\r\nBut a thousand pleadings, even from your lordship, can have no effect.\r\nHonor, interest, and every sensation of the heart, would plead against\r\nyou. We are a people who think not as you think; and what is equally\r\ntrue, you cannot feel as we feel. The situations of the two countries\r\nare exceedingly different. Ours has been the seat of war; yours has seen\r\nnothing of it. The most wanton destruction has been committed in our\r\nsight; the most insolent barbarity has been acted on our feelings. We\r\ncan look round and see the remains of burnt and destroyed houses, once\r\nthe fair fruit of hard industry, and now the striking monuments of\r\nBritish brutality. We walk over the dead whom we loved, in every part of\r\nAmerica, and remember by whom they fell. There is scarcely a village but\r\nbrings to life some melancholy thought, and reminds us of what we have\r\nsuffered, and of those we have lost by the inhumanity of Britain. A\r\nthousand images arise to us, which, from situation, you cannot see, and\r\nare accompanied by as many ideas which you cannot know; and therefore\r\nyour supposed system of reasoning would apply to nothing, and all your\r\nexpectations die of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe question whether England shall accede to the independence of\r\nAmerica, and which your lordship says is to undergo a parliamentary\r\ndiscussion, is so very simple, and composed of so few cases, that it\r\nscarcely needs a debate.\r\n\r\nIt is the only way out of an expensive and ruinous war, which has no\r\nobject, and without which acknowledgment there can be no peace.\r\n\r\nBut your lordship says, the sun of Great Britain will set whenever she\r\nacknowledges the independence of America.--Whereas the metaphor would\r\nhave been strictly just, to have left the sun wholly out of the figure,\r\nand have ascribed her not acknowledging it to the influence of the moon.\r\n\r\nBut the expression, if true, is the greatest confession of disgrace\r\nthat could be made, and furnishes America with the highest notions of\r\nsovereign independent importance. Mr. Wedderburne, about the year 1776,\r\nmade use of an idea of much the same kind,--Relinquish America! says\r\nhe--What is it but to desire a giant to shrink spontaneously into a\r\ndwarf.\r\n\r\nAlas! are those people who call themselves Englishmen, of so little\r\ninternal consequence, that when America is gone, or shuts her eyes\r\nupon them, their sun is set, they can shine no more, but grope about in\r\nobscurity, and contract into insignificant animals? Was America, then,\r\nthe giant of the empire, and England only her dwarf in waiting! Is the\r\ncase so strangely altered, that those who once thought we could not live\r\nwithout them, are now brought to declare that they cannot exist without\r\nus? Will they tell to the world, and that from their first minister of\r\nstate, that America is their all in all; that it is by her importance\r\nonly that they can live, and breathe, and have a being? Will they, who\r\nlong since threatened to bring us to their feet, bow themselves to\r\nours, and own that without us they are not a nation? Are they become so\r\nunqualified to debate on independence, that they have lost all idea of\r\nit themselves, and are calling to the rocks and mountains of America to\r\ncover their insignificance? Or, if America is lost, is it manly to sob\r\nover it like a child for its rattle, and invite the laughter of the\r\nworld by declarations of disgrace? Surely, a more consistent line of\r\nconduct would be to bear it without complaint; and to show that England,\r\nwithout America, can preserve her independence, and a suitable rank with\r\nother European powers. You were not contented while you had her, and to\r\nweep for her now is childish.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Shelburne thinks something may yet be done. What that something\r\nis, or how it is to be accomplished, is a matter in obscurity. By arms\r\nthere is no hope. The experience of nearly eight years, with the expense\r\nof an hundred million pounds sterling, and the loss of two armies,\r\nmust positively decide that point. Besides, the British have lost their\r\ninterest in America with the disaffected. Every part of it has been\r\ntried. There is no new scene left for delusion: and the thousands\r\nwho have been ruined by adhering to them, and have now to quit the\r\nsettlements which they had acquired, and be conveyed like transports to\r\ncultivate the deserts of Augustine and Nova Scotia, has put an end to\r\nall further expectations of aid.\r\n\r\nIf you cast your eyes on the people of England, what have they\r\nto console themselves with for the millions expended? Or, what\r\nencouragement is there left to continue throwing good money after bad?\r\nAmerica can carry on the war for ten years longer, and all the charges\r\nof government included, for less than you can defray the charges of war\r\nand government for one year. And I, who know both countries, know well,\r\nthat the people of America can afford to pay their share of the expense\r\nmuch better than the people of England can. Besides, it is their own\r\nestates and property, their own rights, liberties and government, that\r\nthey are defending; and were they not to do it, they would deserve to\r\nlose all, and none would pity them. The fault would be their own, and\r\ntheir punishment just.\r\n\r\nThe British army in America care not how long the war lasts. They enjoy\r\nan easy and indolent life. They fatten on the folly of one country and\r\nthe spoils of another; and, between their plunder and their prey, may go\r\nhome rich. But the case is very different with the laboring farmer, the\r\nworking tradesman, and the necessitous poor in England, the sweat of\r\nwhose brow goes day after day to feed, in prodigality and sloth, the\r\narmy that is robbing both them and us. Removed from the eye of that\r\ncountry that supports them, and distant from the government that employs\r\nthem, they cut and carve for themselves, and there is none to call them\r\nto account.\r\n\r\nBut England will be ruined, says Lord Shelburne, if America is\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nThen I say, is England already ruined, for America is already\r\nindependent: and if Lord Shelburne will not allow this, he immediately\r\ndenies the fact which he infers. Besides, to make England the mere\r\ncreature of America, is paying too great a compliment to us, and too\r\nlittle to himself.\r\n\r\nBut the declaration is a rhapsody of inconsistency. For to say, as Lord\r\nShelburne has numberless times said, that the war against America is\r\nruinous, and yet to continue the prosecution of that ruinous war for\r\nthe purpose of avoiding ruin, is a language which cannot be understood.\r\nNeither is it possible to see how the independence of America is to\r\naccomplish the ruin of England after the war is over, and yet not affect\r\nit before. America cannot be more independent of her, nor a greater\r\nenemy to her, hereafter than she now is; nor can England derive less\r\nadvantages from her than at present: why then is ruin to follow in the\r\nbest state of the case, and not in the worst? And if not in the worst,\r\nwhy is it to follow at all?\r\n\r\nThat a nation is to be ruined by peace and commerce, and fourteen or\r\nfifteen millions a-year less expenses than before, is a new doctrine in\r\npolitics. We have heard much clamor of national savings and economy; but\r\nsurely the true economy would be, to save the whole charge of a silly,\r\nfoolish, and headstrong war; because, compared with this, all other\r\nretrenchments are baubles and trifles.\r\n\r\nBut is it possible that Lord Shelburne can be serious in supposing that\r\nthe least advantage can be obtained by arms, or that any advantage can\r\nbe equal to the expense or the danger of attempting it? Will not\r\nthe capture of one army after another satisfy him, must all become\r\nprisoners? Must England ever be the sport of hope, and the victim of\r\ndelusion? Sometimes our currency was to fail; another time our army was\r\nto disband; then whole provinces were to revolt. Such a general said\r\nthis and that; another wrote so and so; Lord Chatham was of this\r\nopinion; and lord somebody else of another. To-day 20,000 Russians and\r\n20 Russian ships of the line were to come; to-morrow the empress was\r\nabused without mercy or decency. Then the Emperor of Germany was to\r\nbe bribed with a million of money, and the King of Prussia was to do\r\nwonderful things. At one time it was, Lo here! and then it was, Lo\r\nthere! Sometimes this power, and sometimes that power, was to engage in\r\nthe war, just as if the whole world was mad and foolish like Britain.\r\nAnd thus, from year to year, has every straw been catched at, and every\r\nWill-with-a-wisp led them a new dance.\r\n\r\nThis year a still newer folly is to take place. Lord Shelburne wishes to\r\nbe sent to Congress, and he thinks that something may be done.\r\n\r\nAre not the repeated declarations of Congress, and which all America\r\nsupports, that they will not even hear any proposals whatever, until the\r\nunconditional and unequivocal independence of America is recognised; are\r\nnot, I say, these declarations answer enough?\r\n\r\nBut for England to receive any thing from America now, after so many\r\ninsults, injuries and outrages, acted towards us, would show such\r\na spirit of meanness in her, that we could not but despise her for\r\naccepting it. And so far from Lord Shelburne's coming here to solicit\r\nit, it would be the greatest disgrace we could do them to offer it.\r\nEngland would appear a wretch indeed, at this time of day, to ask or owe\r\nany thing to the bounty of America. Has not the name of Englishman blots\r\nenough upon it, without inventing more? Even Lucifer would scorn to\r\nreign in heaven by permission, and yet an Englishman can creep for only\r\nan entrance into America. Or, has a land of liberty so many charms, that\r\nto be a doorkeeper in it is better than to be an English minister of\r\nstate?\r\n\r\nBut what can this expected something be? Or, if obtained, what can it\r\namount to, but new disgraces, contentions and quarrels? The people\r\nof America have for years accustomed themselves to think and speak so\r\nfreely and contemptuously of English authority, and the inveteracy is\r\nso deeply rooted, that a person invested with any authority from that\r\ncountry, and attempting to exercise it here, would have the life of a\r\ntoad under a harrow. They would look on him as an interloper, to whom\r\ntheir compassion permitted a residence. He would be no more than the\r\nMungo of a farce; and if he disliked that, he must set off. It would\r\nbe a station of degradation, debased by our pity, and despised by our\r\npride, and would place England in a more contemptible situation than\r\nany she has yet been in during the war. We have too high an opinion\r\nof ourselves, even to think of yielding again the least obedience to\r\noutlandish authority; and for a thousand reasons, England would be the\r\nlast country in the world to yield it to. She has been treacherous, and\r\nwe know it. Her character is gone, and we have seen the funeral.\r\n\r\nSurely she loves to fish in troubled waters, and drink the cup of\r\ncontention, or she would not now think of mingling her affairs with\r\nthose of America. It would be like a foolish dotard taking to his arms\r\nthe bride that despises him, or who has placed on his head the ensigns\r\nof her disgust. It is kissing the hand that boxes his ears, and\r\nproposing to renew the exchange. The thought is as servile as the war is\r\nwicked, and shows the last scene of the drama to be as inconsistent as\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nAs America is gone, the only act of manhood is to let her go. Your\r\nlordship had no hand in the separation, and you will gain no honor\r\nby temporising politics. Besides, there is something so exceedingly\r\nwhimsical, unsteady, and even insincere in the present conduct of\r\nEngland, that she exhibits herself in the most dishonorable colors. On\r\nthe second of August last, General Carleton and Admiral Digby wrote to\r\nGeneral Washington in these words:\r\n\r\n\"The resolution of the House of Commons, of the 27th of February last,\r\nhas been placed in Your Excellency's hands, and intimations given at\r\nthe same time that further pacific measures were likely to follow. Since\r\nwhich, until the present time, we have had no direct communications\r\nwith England; but a mail is now arrived, which brings us very important\r\ninformation. We are acquainted, sir, by authority, that negotiations for\r\na general peace have already commenced at Paris, and that Mr. Grenville\r\nis invested with full powers to treat with all the parties at war, and\r\nis now at Paris in execution of his commission. And we are further, sir,\r\nmade acquainted, that His Majesty, in order to remove any obstacles to\r\nthis peace which he so ardently wishes to restore, has commanded his\r\nministers to direct Mr. Grenville, that the independence of the Thirteen\r\nUnited Provinces, should be proposed by him in the first instance,\r\ninstead of making it a condition of a general treaty.\"\r\n\r\nNow, taking your present measures into view, and comparing them with the\r\ndeclaration in this letter, pray what is the word of your king, or his\r\nministers, or the Parliament, good for? Must we not look upon you as a\r\nconfederated body of faithless, treacherous men, whose assurances are\r\nfraud, and their language deceit? What opinion can we possibly form of\r\nyou, but that you are a lost, abandoned, profligate nation, who sport\r\neven with your own character, and are to be held by nothing but the\r\nbayonet or the halter?\r\n\r\nTo say, after this, that the sun of Great Britain will be set whenever\r\nshe acknowledges the independence of America, when the not doing it is\r\nthe unqualified lie of government, can be no other than the language of\r\nridicule, the jargon of inconsistency. There were thousands in America\r\nwho predicted the delusion, and looked upon it as a trick of treachery,\r\nto take us from our guard, and draw off our attention from the only\r\nsystem of finance, by which we can be called, or deserve to be called,\r\na sovereign, independent people. The fraud, on your part, might be worth\r\nattempting, but the sacrifice to obtain it is too high.\r\n\r\nThere are others who credited the assurance, because they thought it\r\nimpossible that men who had their characters to establish, would begin\r\nwith a lie. The prosecution of the war by the former ministry was savage\r\nand horrid; since which it has been mean, trickish, and delusive.\r\nThe one went greedily into the passion of revenge, the other into the\r\nsubtleties of low contrivance; till, between the crimes of both, there\r\nis scarcely left a man in America, be he Whig or Tory, who does not\r\ndespise or detest the conduct of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe management of Lord Shelburne, whatever may be his views, is a\r\ncaution to us, and must be to the world, never to regard British\r\nassurances. A perfidy so notorious cannot be hid. It stands even in the\r\npublic papers of New York, with the names of Carleton and Digby affixed\r\nto it. It is a proclamation that the king of England is not to be\r\nbelieved; that the spirit of lying is the governing principle of the\r\nministry. It is holding up the character of the House of Commons to\r\npublic infamy, and warning all men not to credit them. Such are the\r\nconsequences which Lord Shelburne's management has brought upon his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAfter the authorized declarations contained in Carleton and Digby's\r\nletter, you ought, from every motive of honor, policy and prudence,\r\nto have fulfilled them, whatever might have been the event. It was\r\nthe least atonement that you could possibly make to America, and the\r\ngreatest kindness you could do to yourselves; for you will save millions\r\nby a general peace, and you will lose as many by continuing the war.\r\n\r\nCOMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Oct. 29, 1782.\r\n\r\nP. S. The manuscript copy of this letter is sent your lordship, by the\r\nway of our head-quarters, to New York, inclosing a late pamphlet of\r\nmine, addressed to the Abbe Raynal, which will serve to give your\r\nlordship some idea of the principles and sentiments of America.\r\n\r\n                                                 C.

THOUGHTS ON THE PEACE, AND PROBABLE ADVANTAGES\r\nTHEREOF.\r\n\r\n\"THE times that tried men's souls,\"* are over--and the greatest and\r\ncompletest revolution the world ever knew, gloriously and happily\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * \"These are the times that try men's souls,\" The Crisis No. I.\r\npublished December, 1776.\r\n\r\nBut to pass from the extremes of danger to safety--from the tumult\r\nof war to the tranquillity of peace, though sweet in contemplation,\r\nrequires a gradual composure of the senses to receive it. Even calmness\r\nhas the power of stunning, when it opens too instantly upon us. The long\r\nand raging hurricane that should cease in a moment, would leave us in a\r\nstate rather of wonder than enjoyment; and some moments of recollection\r\nmust pass, before we could be capable of tasting the felicity of repose.\r\nThere are but few instances, in which the mind is fitted for sudden\r\ntransitions: it takes in its pleasures by reflection and comparison\r\nand those must have time to act, before the relish for new scenes is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nIn the present case--the mighty magnitude of the object--the various\r\nuncertainties of fate it has undergone--the numerous and complicated\r\ndangers we have suffered or escaped--the eminence we now stand on,\r\nand the vast prospect before us, must all conspire to impress us with\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nTo see it in our power to make a world happy--to teach mankind the art\r\nof being so--to exhibit, on the theatre of the universe a character\r\nhitherto unknown--and to have, as it were, a new creation intrusted to\r\nour hands, are honors that command reflection, and can neither be too\r\nhighly estimated, nor too gratefully received.\r\n\r\nIn this pause then of recollection--while the storm is ceasing, and the\r\nlong agitated mind vibrating to a rest, let us look back on the scenes\r\nwe have passed, and learn from experience what is yet to be done.\r\n\r\nNever, I say, had a country so many openings to happiness as this. Her\r\nsetting out in life, like the rising of a fair morning, was unclouded\r\nand promising. Her cause was good. Her principles just and liberal. Her\r\ntemper serene and firm. Her conduct regulated by the nicest steps, and\r\neverything about her wore the mark of honor. It is not every country\r\n(perhaps there is not another in the world) that can boast so fair\r\nan origin. Even the first settlement of America corresponds with the\r\ncharacter of the revolution. Rome, once the proud mistress of the\r\nuniverse, was originally a band of ruffians. Plunder and rapine made her\r\nrich, and her oppression of millions made her great. But America need\r\nnever be ashamed to tell her birth, nor relate the stages by which she\r\nrose to empire.\r\n\r\nThe remembrance, then, of what is past, if it operates rightly, must\r\ninspire her with the most laudable of all ambition, that of adding to\r\nthe fair fame she began with. The world has seen her great in adversity;\r\nstruggling, without a thought of yielding, beneath accumulated\r\ndifficulties, bravely, nay proudly, encountering distress, and rising\r\nin resolution as the storm increased. All this is justly due to her, for\r\nher fortitude has merited the character. Let, then, the world see that\r\nshe can bear prosperity: and that her honest virtue in time of peace, is\r\nequal to the bravest virtue in time of war.\r\n\r\nShe is now descending to the scenes of quiet and domestic life. Not\r\nbeneath the cypress shade of disappointment, but to enjoy in her own\r\nland, and under her own vine, the sweet of her labors, and the reward of\r\nher toil.--In this situation, may she never forget that a fair national\r\nreputation is of as much importance as independence. That it possesses\r\na charm that wins upon the world, and makes even enemies civil. That it\r\ngives a dignity which is often superior to power, and commands reverence\r\nwhere pomp and splendor fail.\r\n\r\nIt would be a circumstance ever to be lamented and never to be\r\nforgotten, were a single blot, from any cause whatever, suffered to fall\r\non a revolution, which to the end of time must be an honor to the age\r\nthat accomplished it: and which has contributed more to enlighten the\r\nworld, and diffuse a spirit of freedom and liberality among mankind,\r\nthan any human event (if this may be called one) that ever preceded it.\r\n\r\nIt is not among the least of the calamities of a long continued war,\r\nthat it unhinges the mind from those nice sensations which at other\r\ntimes appear so amiable. The continual spectacle of woe blunts the\r\nfiner feelings, and the necessity of bearing with the sight, renders it\r\nfamiliar. In like manner, are many of the moral obligations of society\r\nweakened, till the custom of acting by necessity becomes an apology,\r\nwhere it is truly a crime. Yet let but a nation conceive rightly of\r\nits character, and it will be chastely just in protecting it. None\r\never began with a fairer than America and none can be under a greater\r\nobligation to preserve it.\r\n\r\nThe debt which America has contracted, compared with the cause she\r\nhas gained, and the advantages to flow from it, ought scarcely to be\r\nmentioned. She has it in her choice to do, and to live as happily as\r\nshe pleases. The world is in her hands. She has no foreign power\r\nto monopolize her commerce, perplex her legislation, or control her\r\nprosperity. The struggle is over, which must one day have happened, and,\r\nperhaps, never could have happened at a better time.* And instead of a\r\ndomineering master, she has gained an ally whose exemplary greatness,\r\nand universal liberality, have extorted a confession even from her\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * That the revolution began at the exact period of time best fitted\r\nto the purpose, is sufficiently proved by the event.--But the great\r\nhinge on which the whole machine turned, is the Union of the States: and\r\nthis union was naturally produced by the inability of any one state to\r\nsupport itself against any foreign enemy without the assistance of the\r\nrest. Had the states severally been less able than they were when\r\nthe war began, their united strength would not have been equal to the\r\nundertaking, and they must in all human probability have failed.--And,\r\non the other hand, had they severally been more able, they might not\r\nhave seen, or, what is more, might not have felt, the necessity\r\nof uniting: and, either by attempting to stand alone or in small\r\nconfederacies, would have been separately conquered. Now, as we cannot\r\nsee a time (and many years must pass away before it can arrive) when the\r\nstrength of any one state, or several united, can be equal to the whole\r\nof the present United States, and as we have seen the extreme difficulty\r\nof collectively prosecuting the war to a successful issue, and\r\npreserving our national importance in the world, therefore, from the\r\nexperience we have had, and the knowledge we have gained, we must,\r\nunless we make a waste of wisdom, be strongly impressed with the\r\nadvantage, as well as the necessity of strengthening that happy union\r\nwhich had been our salvation, and without which we should have been\r\na ruined people. While I was writing this note, I cast my eye on the\r\npamphlet, Common Sense, from which I shall make an extract, as it\r\nexactly applies to the case. It is as follows: \"I have never met with\r\na man, either in England or America, who has not confessed it as his\r\nopinion that a separation between the countries would take place one\r\ntime or other; and there is no instance in which we have shown less\r\njudgment, than in endeavoring to describe what we call the ripeness\r\nor fitness of the continent for independence. As all men allow the\r\nmeasure, and differ only in their opinion of the time, let us, in order\r\nto remove mistakes, take a general survey of things, and endeavor, if\r\npossible, to find out the very time. But we need not to go far,\r\nthe inquiry ceases at once, for, the time has found us. The general\r\nconcurrence, the glorious union of all things prove the fact. It is not\r\nin numbers, but in a union, that our great strength lies. The continent\r\nis just arrived at that pitch of strength, in which no single colony is\r\nable to support itself, and the whole, when united, can accomplish\r\nthe matter; and either more or less than this, might be fatal in its\r\neffects.\"\r\n\r\nWith the blessings of peace, independence, and an universal commerce,\r\nthe states, individually and collectively, will have leisure and\r\nopportunity to regulate and establish their domestic concerns, and to\r\nput it beyond the power of calumny to throw the least reflection on\r\ntheir honor. Character is much easier kept than recovered, and that man,\r\nif any such there be, who, from sinister views, or littleness of soul,\r\nlends unseen his hand to injure it, contrives a wound it will never be\r\nin his power to heal.\r\n\r\nAs we have established an inheritance for posterity, let that\r\ninheritance descend, with every mark of an honorable conveyance.\r\nThe little it will cost, compared with the worth of the states, the\r\ngreatness of the object, and the value of the national character, will\r\nbe a profitable exchange.\r\n\r\nBut that which must more forcibly strike a thoughtful, penetrating mind,\r\nand which includes and renders easy all inferior concerns, is the UNION\r\nOF THE STATES. On this our great national character depends. It is this\r\nwhich must give us importance abroad and security at home. It is through\r\nthis only that we are, or can be, nationally known in the world; it is\r\nthe flag of the United States which renders our ships and commerce safe\r\non the seas, or in a foreign port. Our Mediterranean passes must be\r\nobtained under the same style. All our treaties, whether of alliance,\r\npeace, or commerce, are formed under the sovereignty of the United\r\nStates, and Europe knows us by no other name or title.\r\n\r\nThe division of the empire into states is for our own convenience, but\r\nabroad this distinction ceases. The affairs of each state are local.\r\nThey can go no further than to itself. And were the whole worth of even\r\nthe richest of them expended in revenue, it would not be sufficient to\r\nsupport sovereignty against a foreign attack. In short, we have no other\r\nnational sovereignty than as United States. It would even be fatal\r\nfor us if we had--too expensive to be maintained, and impossible to be\r\nsupported. Individuals, or individual states, may call themselves what\r\nthey please; but the world, and especially the world of enemies, is\r\nnot to be held in awe by the whistling of a name. Sovereignty must have\r\npower to protect all the parts that compose and constitute it: and as\r\nUNITED STATES we are equal to the importance of the title, but otherwise\r\nwe are not. Our union, well and wisely regulated and cemented, is the\r\ncheapest way of being great--the easiest way of being powerful, and the\r\nhappiest invention in government which the circumstances of America can\r\nadmit of.--Because it collects from each state, that which, by being\r\ninadequate, can be of no use to it, and forms an aggregate that serves\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\nThe states of Holland are an unfortunate instance of the effects of\r\nindividual sovereignty. Their disjointed condition exposes them to\r\nnumerous intrigues, losses, calamities, and enemies; and the almost\r\nimpossibility of bringing their measures to a decision, and that\r\ndecision into execution, is to them, and would be to us, a source of\r\nendless misfortune.\r\n\r\nIt is with confederated states as with individuals in society; something\r\nmust be yielded up to make the whole secure. In this view of things\r\nwe gain by what we give, and draw an annual interest greater than the\r\ncapital.--I ever feel myself hurt when I hear the union, that great\r\npalladium of our liberty and safety, the least irreverently spoken of.\r\nIt is the most sacred thing in the constitution of America, and that\r\nwhich every man should be most proud and tender of. Our citizenship\r\nin the United States is our national character. Our citizenship in any\r\nparticular state is only our local distinction. By the latter we\r\nare known at home, by the former to the world. Our great title is\r\nAMERICANS--our inferior one varies with the place.\r\n\r\nSo far as my endeavors could go, they have all been directed to\r\nconciliate the affections, unite the interests, and draw and keep\r\nthe mind of the country together; and the better to assist in this\r\nfoundation work of the revolution, I have avoided all places of profit\r\nor office, either in the state I live in, or in the United States; kept\r\nmyself at a distance from all parties and party connections, and even\r\ndisregarded all private and inferior concerns: and when we take into\r\nview the great work which we have gone through, and feel, as we ought\r\nto feel, the just importance of it, we shall then see, that the\r\nlittle wranglings and indecent contentions of personal parley, are as\r\ndishonorable to our characters, as they are injurious to our repose.\r\n\r\nIt was the cause of America that made me an author. The force with which\r\nit struck my mind and the dangerous condition the country appeared to me\r\nin, by courting an impossible and an unnatural reconciliation with those\r\nwho were determined to reduce her, instead of striking out into the only\r\nline that could cement and save her, A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, made\r\nit impossible for me, feeling as I did, to be silent: and if, in the\r\ncourse of more than seven years, I have rendered her any service, I have\r\nlikewise added something to the reputation of literature, by freely and\r\ndisinterestedly employing it in the great cause of mankind, and showing\r\nthat there may be genius without prostitution.\r\n\r\nIndependence always appeared to me practicable and probable, provided\r\nthe sentiment of the country could be formed and held to the object:\r\nand there is no instance in the world, where a people so extended,\r\nand wedded to former habits of thinking, and under such a variety of\r\ncircumstances, were so instantly and effectually pervaded, by a turn\r\nin politics, as in the case of independence; and who supported their\r\nopinion, undiminished, through such a succession of good and ill\r\nfortune, till they crowned it with success.\r\n\r\nBut as the scenes of war are closed, and every man preparing for home\r\nand happier times, I therefore take my leave of the subject. I have most\r\nsincerely followed it from beginning to end, and through all its turns\r\nand windings: and whatever country I may hereafter be in, I shall always\r\nfeel an honest pride at the part I have taken and acted, and a gratitude\r\nto nature and providence for putting it in my power to be of some use to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n                                                COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, April 19, 1783.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUPERNUMERARY CRISIS: TO THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nIN \"_Rivington's New York Gazette_,\" of December 6th, is a publication,\r\nunder the appearance of a letter from London, dated September 30th; and\r\nis on a subject which demands the attention of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe public will remember that a treaty of commerce between the United\r\nStates and England was set on foot last spring, and that until the\r\nsaid treaty could be completed, a bill was brought into the British\r\nParliament by the then chancellor of the exchequer, Mr. Pitt, to admit\r\nand legalize (as the case then required) the commerce of the United\r\nStates into the British ports and dominions. But neither the one nor the\r\nother has been completed. The commercial treaty is either broken off, or\r\nremains as it began; and the bill in Parliament has been thrown aside.\r\nAnd in lieu thereof, a selfish system of English politics has started\r\nup, calculated to fetter the commerce of America, by engrossing to\r\nEngland the carrying trade of the American produce to the West India\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nAmong the advocates for this last measure is Lord Sheffield, a member\r\nof the British Parliament, who has published a pamphlet entitled\r\n\"Observations on the Commerce of the American States.\" The pamphlet\r\nhas two objects; the one is to allure the Americans to purchase British\r\nmanufactures; and the other to spirit up the British Parliament to\r\nprohibit the citizens of the United States from trading to the West\r\nIndia islands.\r\n\r\nViewed in this light, the pamphlet, though in some parts dexterously\r\nwritten, is an absurdity. It offends, in the very act of endeavoring\r\nto ingratiate; and his lordship, as a politician, ought not to have\r\nsuffered the two objects to have appeared together. The latter alluded\r\nto, contains extracts from the pamphlet, with high encomiums on Lord\r\nSheffield, for laboriously endeavoring (as the letter styles it) \"to\r\nshow the mighty advantages of retaining the carrying trade.\"\r\n\r\nSince the publication of this pamphlet in England, the commerce of\r\nthe United States to the West Indies, in American vessels, has been\r\nprohibited; and all intercourse, except in British bottoms, the property\r\nof and navigated by British subjects, cut off.\r\n\r\nThat a country has a right to be as foolish as it pleases, has been\r\nproved by the practice of England for many years past: in her island\r\nsituation, sequestered from the world, she forgets that her whispers are\r\nheard by other nations; and in her plans of politics and commerce she\r\nseems not to know, that other votes are necessary besides her own.\r\nAmerica would be equally as foolish as Britain, were she to suffer so\r\ngreat a degradation on her flag, and such a stroke on the freedom of her\r\ncommerce, to pass without a balance.\r\n\r\nWe admit the right of any nation to prohibit the commerce of another\r\ninto its own dominions, where there are no treaties to the contrary; but\r\nas this right belongs to one side as well as the other, there is always\r\na way left to bring avarice and insolence to reason.\r\n\r\nBut the ground of security which Lord Sheffield has chosen to erect his\r\npolicy upon, is of a nature which ought, and I think must, awaken\r\nin every American a just and strong sense of national dignity. Lord\r\nSheffield appears to be sensible, that in advising the British nation\r\nand Parliament to engross to themselves so great a part of the carrying\r\ntrade of America, he is attempting a measure which cannot succeed, if\r\nthe politics of the United States be properly directed to counteract the\r\nassumption.\r\n\r\nBut, says he, in his pamphlet, \"It will be a long time before the\r\nAmerican states can be brought to act as a nation, neither are they to\r\nbe feared as such by us.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is this more or less than to tell us, that while we have no\r\nnational system of commerce, the British will govern our trade by their\r\nown laws and proclamations as they please. The quotation discloses\r\na truth too serious to be overlooked, and too mischievous not to be\r\nremedied.\r\n\r\nAmong other circumstances which led them to this discovery none could\r\noperate so effectually as the injudicious, uncandid and indecent\r\nopposition made by sundry persons in a certain state, to the\r\nrecommendations of Congress last winter, for an import duty of five per\r\ncent. It could not but explain to the British a weakness in the national\r\npower of America, and encourage them to attempt restrictions on her\r\ntrade, which otherwise they would not have dared to hazard. Neither is\r\nthere any state in the union, whose policy was more misdirected to its\r\ninterest than the state I allude to, because her principal support is\r\nthe carrying trade, which Britain, induced by the want of a well-centred\r\npower in the United States to protect and secure, is now attempting to\r\ntake away. It fortunately happened (and to no state in the union more\r\nthan the state in question) that the terms of peace were agreed on\r\nbefore the opposition appeared, otherwise, there cannot be a doubt, that\r\nif the same idea of the diminished authority of America had occurred\r\nto them at that time as has occurred to them since, but they would have\r\nmade the same grasp at the fisheries, as they have done at the carrying\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that an authority which can be supported with so much\r\nease, and so little expense, and capable of such extensive advantages\r\nto the country, should be cavilled at by those whose duty it is to watch\r\nover it, and whose existence as a people depends upon it. But this,\r\nperhaps, will ever be the case, till some misfortune awakens us into\r\nreason, and the instance now before us is but a gentle beginning of what\r\nAmerica must expect, unless she guards her union with nicer care and\r\nstricter honor. United, she is formidable, and that with the least\r\npossible charge a nation can be so; separated, she is a medley of\r\nindividual nothings, subject to the sport of foreign nations.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that the ingenuity of commerce may have found out\r\na method to evade and supersede the intentions of the British, in\r\ninterdicting the trade with the West India islands. The language of both\r\nbeing the same, and their customs well understood, the vessels of one\r\ncountry may, by deception, pass for those of another. But this would\r\nbe a practice too debasing for a sovereign people to stoop to, and too\r\nprofligate not to be discountenanced. An illicit trade, under any shape\r\nit can be placed, cannot be carried on without a violation of truth.\r\nAmerica is now sovereign and independent, and ought to conduct her\r\naffairs in a regular style of character. She has the same right to\r\nsay that no British vessel shall enter ports, or that no British\r\nmanufactures shall be imported, but in American bottoms, the property\r\nof, and navigated by American subjects, as Britain has to say the same\r\nthing respecting the West Indies. Or she may lay a duty of ten, fifteen,\r\nor twenty shillings per ton (exclusive of other duties) on every\r\nBritish vessel coming from any port of the West Indies, where she is not\r\nadmitted to trade, the said tonnage to continue as long on her side as\r\nthe prohibition continues on the other.\r\n\r\nBut it is only by acting in union, that the usurpations of foreign\r\nnations on the freedom of trade can be counteracted, and security\r\nextended to the commerce of America. And when we view a flag, which to\r\nthe eye is beautiful, and to contemplate its rise and origin inspires\r\na sensation of sublime delight, our national honor must unite with our\r\ninterest to prevent injury to the one, or insult to the other.\r\n\r\n                                                COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, December 9, 1783.",
