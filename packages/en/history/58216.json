The work was undertaken with the\r\nidea of compiling a narrative plainly told, of the people and the\r\ninstitutions here. I was interested in putting in permanent form\r\nchronologically the events that have transpired in the past sixty years,\r\nthat have made for the political, social, moral and commercial\r\ndevelopment of the county, but, had I realized in advance the many hours\r\nof labor and patient study it required, the work of completing the task\r\nin six months would not have been attempted. I am very deeply conscious\r\nof the imperfections of the completed work, but had there been more time\r\nfor research and study, much might have been included that does not\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nIt would be ingratitude if no acknowledgment were made at the outset, of\r\nthe obligation I am under to George J. Remsburg for the assistance he\r\nhas rendered me. Without his unfailing courtesy, kindness and help I\r\nshould never have been able to do the work at all. His ability as a\r\nlocal historian is truly marvelous. He wrote two chapters of the history\r\nand contributed most of the matter touching upon the founding of cities\r\nand towns. It is to be regretted that the condition of his health\r\nprevented him from undertaking the work which I have so imperfectly\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgment is also due George A. Root of the State Historical\r\nSociety, who has rendered me invaluable assistance, and to the _Atchison\r\nDaily Globe_, from whose files I gathered much important data. Nor can I\r\nfail to give proper credit to Andreas’ History of Kansas, from which a\r\nwealth of information has been secured. D. Anna Speer, county\r\nsuperintendent, collected for me most of the historical matter relative\r\nto the schools of the county and Professor Nathan T. Veatch was more\r\nthan kind in preparing for me a sketch of the Atchison city schools.\r\n\r\nAnd my dear mother, a loyal resident of Atchison since July, 1859,\r\nintimately identified with its history and growth for fifty-seven years,\r\nhas visualized to me as no other could, the story of the early days.\r\nRemarkable as a mother, loved and adored by all her children, she is no\r\nless remarkable\r\n\r\nas a woman, stalwart, rugged and buoyant. She lived her young life with\r\nthe pioneers of Atchison, and now in the fullness of her years she looks\r\nover the past, so full of pleasures, tribulations and sorrows, with\r\ngladness and resignation, and faces the future with a determined spirit\r\nand a brave heart.\r\n\r\nTo the ministers of the various churches of Atchison and to Professor\r\nErasmus Haworth and Charles H. Taylor, the county farm agent, and to\r\nmany other good people of Atchison, I entertain sentiments of the\r\ndeepest appreciation, and if any of them ever undertakes the work of\r\nwriting a history, I shall gladly render them any service in my power.\r\n\r\n                                                      SHEFFIELD INGALLS.\r\n\r\n Atchison, Kan., March 6, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Abell, P.

These denizens of long\r\nago, by their lives, made it possible for later and better citizens to\r\nlive and flourish in the happy and contented homes of her best citizens\r\nof the present day. Long before man ever saw Atchison county—long before\r\nman lived anywhere upon this earth, the seas swarmed with animal life\r\nand the dry lands supported a fauna and a flora substantially as great\r\nas those of the present time.\r\n\r\nIn character the animals and plants of those early days were very\r\ndifferent from those of the present time. Almost all of their kind long\r\nago became extinct. It is only the few who have living representatives\r\nanywhere in the world today, and they are degraded in form and size as\r\nthough they had long outlived their usefulness. Some of the animals live\r\nin the waters of distant oceans, such as the brachiopods and other shell\r\nfish; the crinoids or sea lilies, and others of like character. On the\r\ndry land we find a few insects of the cock-roach type and other creeping\r\nthings which inhabit dark and damp places, animals of gloom on whose\r\nforms the sunshine of day rarely falls.\r\n\r\nThe plants, likewise, are degraded in size and form. The modern bull-\r\nrushes of our swamps are descendants of ancient giants of their kind\r\nwhich grew to ten or twenty times the size of their modern\r\nrepresentatives. The little creeping vines sometimes found in the shaded\r\nforest are lineal descendants of the mighty trees of the forests in the\r\nlong ago while materials were gathering for the rock masses constituting\r\nAtchison county.\r\n\r\nIn order to converse rationally about geological time it has been found\r\nmost convenient to divide time into periods in accordance with great\r\nnatural events, and to give a name to each period that in some way\r\nexpresses something desirable to be known and remembered. Usually\r\ngeographic names of areas where rock masses are exposed to the surface\r\nof the ground are chosen, or some favorite geographic term may be used,\r\nand in rare instances some quality name expressive of the character or\r\ncomposition of the rocks.\r\n\r\nFollowing the best usage of geologists the rocks exposed at the surface\r\nall belong to the age known as the Carboniferous, which lies at the top\r\nof the Palaeozoic, or ancient life rocks. The Carboniferous is divided\r\nand subdivided into a number of divisions, the lowermost of which has\r\nbeen named the Mississippian on account of their great abundance\r\nthroughout the Mississippi valley. Above the Mississippian we find a\r\nmass of alternating beds of shale and limestone and sandstone\r\naggregating about 2,500 feet in thickness, called the Pennsylvanians, a\r\nterm borrowed from the State of Pennsylvania, where rocks of the same\r\nage so abound. Rocks formed during the remainder of geologic time are\r\nnot found in Atchison county, except the covering of soil and clay so\r\nabundant throughout the county. An old-time name for the Pennsylvanian\r\nrocks is the coal-measures, a term now on the decline because the newer\r\nnames—well, it is newer.\r\n\r\nIt appears that from the close of the Pennsylvanian time to the present\r\nAtchison county has been dry land. At one time, quite recently, as\r\ngeologists reckon time, climatic conditions changed so that the snow\r\nfalling during the winter could not be melted during the summer, so that\r\nto the far north great quantities of snow and ice accumulated and\r\ngradually spread over the surface of a large part of North America. One\r\nlimb of this ice mass moved slowly southward and covered all of Atchison\r\ncounty, and much adjacent territory, and brought with it vast quantities\r\nof soil and clay and gravel that the ice sheet, as a great scraper,\r\npicked up from the surface as it came along. When the ice finally melted\r\nthis debris was left, like a mantle of snow, covering the entire surface\r\nof Atchison county.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of Pennsylvanian age have within them much of value\r\neconomically. Here and there inter-stratified with the sandstone and\r\nshale are large and valuable beds of coal, as is abundantly shown by the\r\ndrilled wells and coal shafts within the county. It is probable that\r\nalmost the entire county is underlaid with this same bed of coal, and if\r\nso it is worth substantially as much to the county as is the surface\r\nsoil. It lies at so great a depth that it may be mined without any\r\ndanger whatever of disturbing the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Main Building State Orphans’ Home, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe large amount of good hard limestone in the county guarantees an\r\neverlasting supply of stone for road making, railroad ballast, crushed\r\nrock for concrete works and all other uses to which such limestone may\r\nbe put. With the Missouri river on the eastern boundary carrying\r\nunlimited amounts of sand Atchison county is well supplied with every\r\nmaterial needed for unlimited amounts of mortar construction of all\r\nkinds. Recently, since Portland cement construction has so effectually\r\nreplaced stone masonry, this becomes a very important matter.\r\n\r\nShould market conditions ever become favorable it is also possible to\r\nmanufacture the best grades of Portland cement by properly combining the\r\nlimestones and shales of the county. Their chemical and physical\r\nproperties are admirably suited for such purposes.\r\n\r\nThere is a possibility that somewhere within the county oil and gas may\r\nbe found by proper prospecting. As no search for these materials has yet\r\nbeen made it is impossible to say what the results might be. Atchison\r\ncounty, however, lies within the oil zone that has been proven to be so\r\nmuch farther south, and until proper search has been made no one can say\r\nthat oil and gas cannot be found here also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                          PRE-HISTORIC PERIOD.\r\n\r\n  EVIDENCES OF PALEOLITHIC MAN—AN ANCIENT FORTIFICATION—ABORIGINAL\r\n      VILLAGE AND CAMP SITES—THE INGALLS AND OTHER BURIAL MOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long the region embraced in Atchison county has been the home of man\r\nis not known, but the finding of a prehistoric human skeleton, computed\r\nby the highest anthropological and geological authorities to be at least\r\n10,000 years old, in the adjoining county of Leavenworth, favors the\r\npresumption that what is now Atchison county was occupied by man at an\r\nequally remote period. Evidences of a very early human existence here\r\nhave been found at various times. Near Potter, in this county, the\r\nwriter found deep in the undisturbed gravel and clay, a rude flint\r\nimplement that unquestionably had been fashioned by prehistoric man,\r\nevidently, of what is known as the Paleolithic period. In drilling the\r\nwell at the power house of the Atchison Street Railway, Light and Power\r\nCompany, the late T. J. Ingels, of Atchison, encountered at a great\r\ndepth, several fragments of fossilized bone, intermingled with charcoal,\r\nevidently the remains of a very ancient fireplace. About 1880, M. M.\r\nTrimmer, an Atchison contractor, in opening a stone quarry at the\r\nnortheast point of the Branchtown hill, near the confluence of White\r\nClay and Brewery creeks, in Atchison, unexpectedly encountered a pit or\r\nexcavation, eighty feet long, sixty feet wide, and eighteen feet deep,\r\nin the solid rock formation of the hill. The surface of the hill is\r\ncomposed of drift or gravel, and the pit had become filled with this\r\ngravel to the original surface, thus obliterating all external evidences\r\nof its existence. The lower layer of stone, about six inches thick, had\r\nbeen left for a floor in the pit, and in the northwest corner this lower\r\nstrata of stone for about four feet square had been removed. Water\r\nissued from the ground at this point indicating that a spring or well,\r\nor source of water supply, had been located here. A careful examination\r\nof the place at the time showed unmistakably that this excavation had\r\nbeen made by human hands at a very early period and was probably used as\r\na fortification or defensive work. Prehistoric excavations of this\r\ncharacter, made in the solid rock, are common in Europe, but almost\r\nunknown in America, except in the cases of ancient flint and steatite\r\nquarries, and the absence of either in the Atchison formation, except an\r\noccasional flint nodule, precludes the possibility that this was just an\r\naboriginal quarry. The Smithsonian authorities at Washington pronounced\r\nthe work worthy of careful study, but unfortunately it was obliterated\r\nby the progress of the quarrying. Many weapons and implements of the\r\nstone age have been found in the vicinity of this pit.\r\n\r\nAlmost the entire surface of Atchison county, particularly where\r\nbordering streams, presents various traces of aboriginal occupancy, from\r\nthe silent sepulchers of the dead and the mouldy rubbish of the wigwam,\r\nto the solitary arrowhead lost on the happy chase or the sanguinary war\r\npath. In many places these remains blend into the prehistoric, semi-\r\nhistoric and historic periods, showing evidences of a succession of\r\noccupancy. For instance we find the Neolithic stone celts or hatchets,\r\nthe Neoeric iron tomahawks; fragments of fragile earthenware, mixed and\r\nmoulded by the prehistoric potter, and bits of modern decorated\r\nporcelain made by some pale-faced patterner of Palissy; ornaments of\r\nstone, bone and shell; trinkets of brass and beads of glass,\r\nintermingled in confusion and profusion. These numerous relics of\r\ndifferent peoples and periods, showing, as they do, diverse stages of\r\nculture and advancement, warrant the opinion that Atchison county, with\r\nits many natural advantages, was a favorite resort of successive peoples\r\nfrom time immemorial. Favorably situated at the great western bend of\r\nthe Missouri river and at the outskirts of which was one of the richest\r\nIndian hunting grounds in the great wild West, embracing and surrounded\r\nby every natural advantage that would make it the prospective and wonted\r\nhaunt of a wild-race, it was a prehistoric paradise, as it is today, a\r\nmodern Arcadia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  State Orphans’ Home, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe writer has personally examined hundreds of ancient Indian village,\r\ncamp and workshop sites, and opened a number of mounds in Atchison\r\ncounty. The first ancient mounds ever opened in the county were on a\r\nvery rugged hill known as the “Devil’s Backbone,” bordering Owl creek,\r\nand overlooking the Missouri river, in 1891. There were two of them, and\r\nthey contained stone sepulchers in which the Indians had cremated their\r\ndead. Other stone grave mounds have been opened on the farms of John\r\nMyers, on Independence creek, in the northeastern part of the county;\r\nMaurice Fiehley, on Stranger creek, near Potter; George Storch, on\r\nAlcorn or Whiskey creek, just south of Atchison, and in several other\r\nplaces. The most interesting mound ever excavated in the county,\r\nhowever, was what is known as the Ingalls Mound, on land belonging to\r\nthe estate of the late United States Senator John J. Ingalls, on a bluff\r\nof the Missouri river, at the mouth of Walnut creek, about five miles\r\nbelow Atchison. This mound was discovered by Senator Ingalls at an early\r\nday, and opened by the writer in 1907. It was fifteen feet in diameter,\r\nand was composed of alternate layers of stone and earth one on top of\r\nthe other, the remains of several Indians being imbedded in the earth\r\nbetween the layers of stone. These remains were in a bad state of decay,\r\nmost of the bones crumbling while being removed. The bones of each\r\nperson had been placed in the mound in compact bundles, which seems to\r\nindicate that they had been removed from some temporary place of\r\ninterment, perhaps from dilapidated scaffold burials, and deposited here\r\nin final sepulture. In some of the layers not only the bones but the\r\nrocks and earth were considerably burned, indicating incendiary funeral\r\nrites, while in others there were not the least marks of fire. The\r\nundermost layer, about three feet from the top, was a veritable cinder\r\npit, being a burned mass or conglomerate of charcoal and charred and\r\ncalcined human remains, showing no regularity or outline of skeletons,\r\nbut all in utter confusion. A solitary pearl bead was the only object\r\nthat withstood the terrible heat to which the lower tier of remains had\r\nbeen subjected. In one of the upper tiers were the bones of two infants.\r\nWith one of them was a necklace of small shells of a species not native\r\nhere. With another bundle of bones were two small, neatly chipped flint\r\nknives, a flint scraper, a bone whistle or “call,” several deer horn\r\nimplements, and a large flint implement of doubtful usage, known to\r\narchaeologists as a “turtle-back,” because of its shape. With another\r\nbundle of bones, and which they seemed to be clasping, were several\r\nmussel shells, badly decomposed. One small ornament of an animal or bird\r\nclaw, several flint arrowheads, and some fragments of pottery, were also\r\nfound. In one of the skulls was embedded the flint blade of a war-club.\r\nThirty-one yards northwest of this mound was found another of less\r\nprominence. It contained a burned mass of human remains, covered with a\r\nlayer of about six inches of clay, baked almost to the consistency of\r\nbrick. Lack of space forbids a mention of many other interesting\r\narchaeological discoveries made in this county from time to time.\r\nSuffice to say that there is ample evidence that within the borders of\r\nAtchison county there lived and thrived and passed away a considerable\r\naboriginal population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                            INDIAN HISTORY.\r\n\r\n  HARAHEY, AN INDIAN PROVINCE OF CORONADO’S TIME—THE KANSA NATION—\r\n      BOURGMONT’S VISIT IN 1724—COUNCIL ON COW ISLAND IN 1819—THE\r\n      KICKAPOO INDIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing definite to show that Coronado ever reached the\r\nconfines of what is now Atchison county in 1541, as some historical\r\nwriters have seen fit to state, but there is a probability that the\r\nIndian province of Harahey, which the natives thereof told him was just\r\nbeyond Quivira, embraced our present county and most of the region of\r\nnortheastern Kansas. Mark F. Zimmerman, an intelligent and painstaking\r\nstudent of Kansas archaeology and Indian history, has given this matter\r\nmuch consideration, and is confident that the Harahey chieftain,\r\nTatarrax, immortalized in Coronado’s chronicles, ruled over this\r\nterritory nearly four centuries ago. Until this fact is established,\r\nhowever, it remains that the Indian history of what is now Atchison\r\ncounty begins with the Kansa Indians in the early part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. At the time of the Bourgmont expedition in 1724, and for some\r\ntime before, this nation owned all of what is now northeastern Kansas,\r\nand maintained several villages along the Missouri river, the principal\r\none being near the mouth of Independence creek, or at the present site\r\nof Doniphan. Here they had a large town. The writer made a careful\r\nexamination and fully identified the site of this old town in 1904. The\r\nresults of this exploration are given in a pamphlet entitled “An Old\r\nKansas Indian Town on the Missouri,” published by the writer in 1914.\r\nAnother important village of the Kansa was located at the mouth of what\r\nis now Salt creek, in Leavenworth county. Both of these historic\r\nvillages were situated right near and at about the same distance from\r\nthe present borders of Atchison county. There were several old Indian\r\nvillages within the confines of Atchison county, as already stated in\r\nthe preceding pages, but whether they belonged to the Kansa or to the\r\nHarahey (Pawnee) is yet a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nOne of these old Kansa towns, evidently the one at Salt creek, was the\r\nsite of an important French post. Bougainville on French Posts in 1757,\r\nsays: “_Kanses._ In ascending this stream (the Missouri river) we meet\r\nthe village of the Kanses. We have there a garrison with a commandant,\r\nappointed as in the case with Pimiteoui and Fort Chartres, by New\r\nOrleans. This post produces one hundred bundles of furs.” Lewis and\r\nClark, in 1804, noted the ruins of this old post and Kansa village. They\r\nwere just outside of the southern borders of Atchison county, near the\r\npresent site of Kickapoo.\r\n\r\nThe Independence creek town, or what is generally referred to by the\r\nearly French as “Grand village des Canzes,” seems to have been a Jesuit\r\nMissionary station as early as 1727, according to Hon. George P.\r\nMorehouse, the historian of the Kansa Indians, who recently found in\r\nsome old French-Canadian records of the province of Ontario an\r\ninteresting fact not before recognized in Kansas history, that the name\r\n“Kansas” was a well known geographical term to designate a place on the\r\nMissouri river, within the present borders of our State, where the\r\nFrench government and its official church, nearly 200 years ago, had an\r\nimportant missionary center. Mr. Morehouse says: “It is significant as\r\nto the standing of this Mission station of the Jesuits at Kanzas, away\r\nout in the heart of the continent, that in this document it was classed\r\nalong with their other important Indian Missions, such as the Iroquois,\r\nAbenaquis, and Tadoussac, and that the same amount per missionary was\r\nexpended. It was ‘Kansas,’ a mission charge on the rolls of the Jesuit\r\nFathers, for which annual appropriations of money were made as early as\r\n1727. Here some of the saintly, self-sacrificing missionary pioneers of\r\nthe Cross must have come from distant Quebec and Montreal, or from the\r\nfaraway cloisters of sunny France. What zeal and sacrifice for others!\r\nIs it any wonder that the Kansa Indians always spoke reverently of the\r\n‘black robes,’ who were the first to labor for their welfare in that\r\nlong period in the wilderness.”\r\n\r\nJust when the Kansa Indians established themselves at the “Grand\r\nVillage” at Doniphan, or at “Fort Village” at Kickapoo, is not known.\r\nThe first recorded mention of a Kansa village along this section of the\r\nMissouri river is by Bourgmont in 1724. Onate met the Kansa on a hunting\r\nexpedition on the prairies of Kansas in 1601, but does not state where\r\ntheir villages were located. The “Grand Village” was an old one,\r\nhowever, at the time of Bourgmont’s visit. Bourgmont does not mention\r\nthe “Fort Village” at Salt creek, as he surely would had it been in\r\nexistence at that time, and it is believed that it was established\r\nlater, as it was in existence in 1757, as stated by Bourgainville.\r\n\r\nAs is a well known historical fact the Spanish attempted to invade and\r\ncolonize the Missouri valley early in the eighteenth century. The French\r\nhad come into possession of this region in 1682, and M. de Bourgmont was\r\ncommissioned military commander on the Missouri in 1720, the French\r\ngovernment becoming alarmed at the attempted Spanish invasion.\r\nEstablishing friendly relations with the Indians of this region in order\r\nto have their assistance in repelling any further Spanish advance was\r\nthe object of the Bourgmont expedition to the Kansa and Padouca Indians\r\nin 1724. Bourgmont’s party, consisting of himself, M. Bellerive, Sieur\r\nRenaudiere, two soldiers and five other Frenchmen, besides 177 Missouri\r\nand Osage Indians in charge of their own chiefs, marched overland from\r\nFort Orleans, on the lower Missouri, and arrived at the “Grand village\r\ndes Cansez” on July 7, 1724. Here they held a celebration of two weeks,\r\nconsisting of pow-wows, councils, trading horses or merchandise, and\r\nmaking presents to the Indians, several boat loads of the latter, in\r\ncharge of Lieutenant Saint Ange, having arrived by river route. On July\r\n24 they “put themselves in battle array on the village height, the drum\r\nbegan to beat, and they marched away” on their journey to the Padoucas.\r\nThe incidents of their march across what is now Atchison county, and\r\nother facts pertaining to this expedition will be found in the chapter\r\non early explorations in this volume.\r\n\r\nAccording to a tradition handed down from prehistoric times the Kansa,\r\nOsage, Omaha, Ponca and Kwapa were originally one people and lived along\r\nthe Wabash and Ohio rivers. In their migrations they arrived at the\r\nmouth of the Ohio where there was a separation. Those who went down the\r\nMississippi became known as the Kwapa, or “down stream people,” while\r\nthose going up were called Omaha, or “up stream people.” At the mouth of\r\nthe Missouri another division took place, the Omaha and Ponka proceeding\r\nfar up that stream. The Osage located on the stream which bears their\r\nname, and the Kansa at the mouth of what is now the Kansas river. Later\r\nthey moved on up the Missouri and established several villages, the most\r\nnorthern of which was at Independence Creek. At about the close of the\r\nRevolutionary war they were driven away from the Missouri by the Iowa\r\nand Sauk tribes, and they took up a permanent residence on the Kansas\r\nriver, where Major Long’s expedition visited them in 1810. They\r\ncontinued to make predatory visits to the Missouri, however. They\r\ncommitted many depredations on traders and explorers passing up the\r\nriver and even fired on the United States troops encamped at Cow Island.\r\nIt was to prevent the recurrence of such outrages that Major O’Fallon\r\narranged a council with the Kansa Nation. This council was held on Cow\r\nIsland August 24, 1819, under an arbor built for the occasion. Major\r\nO’Fallon made a speech in which he set forth the cause of complaint\r\nwhich the Kansa had given by their repeated insults and depredations,\r\ngiving them notice of the approach of a military force sufficient to\r\nchastise their insolence, and advising them to seize the present\r\nopportunity of averting the vengeance they deserved, by proper\r\nconcessions, and by their future good behavior to conciliate those whose\r\nfriendship they would have so much occasion to desire. The replies of\r\nthe chiefs were simple and short, expressive of their conviction of the\r\njustice of the complaints against them, and of their acquiescence in the\r\nterms of the reconciliation proposed by the agent.\r\n\r\nThere were present at this council 161 Kansa Indians, including chiefs\r\nand warriors, and thirteen Osages. It was afterwards learned that the\r\ndelegation would have been larger but for a quarrel that arose among the\r\nchiefs after they had started, in regard to precedence in rank, in\r\nconsequence of which ten or twelve returned to the village on the Kansas\r\nriver. Among those at the council were Na-he-da-ba, or Long Neck, one of\r\nthe principal chiefs of the Kansas; Ka-he-ga-wa-to-ning-ga, or Little\r\nChief, second in rank; Shen-ga-ne-ga, an ex-principal chief; Wa-ha-che-\r\nra, or Big Knife, a war chief, and Wam-pa-wa-ra, or White Plume,\r\nafterwards a noted chief. Major O’Fallon had with him the officers of\r\nthe garrison of Cow Island, or Cantonment Martin, and a few of those\r\nconnected with Major Long’s exploring party. “The ceremonies,” says one\r\naccount, “were enlivened by a military display, such as the firing of\r\ncannon, hoisting of flags, and an exhibition of rockets and shells, the\r\nlatter evidently making a deeper impression on the Indians than the\r\neloquence of Major O’Fallon.” A description of Major Long’s steamboat,\r\nbuilt to impress the Indians on this occasion, will be found in the\r\nfollowing chapter on early explorations.\r\n\r\nFrom the Kansa Indians our State derived its name. For more than 300\r\nyears they dwelt upon our soil. At their very advent in this region what\r\nis now Atchison county became a part of their heritage and for\r\ngenerations it was a part of their imperial home.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Castor Hill, Mo., October 24, 1832, the Kickapoo\r\nIndians were assigned to a reservation in northeastern Kansas, which\r\nincluded most of what is now Atchison county. They settled on their new\r\nlands shortly after the treaty was made. Their principal settlement at\r\nthat time was at the present site of Kickapoo, in Leavenworth county,\r\nwhere a Methodist mission was established among them by Rev. Jerome C.\r\nBerryman, in 1833. There is said to have been a mission station among\r\nthe Kickapoos where Oak Mills, in Atchison county, now stands, at an\r\nearly day, but nothing definite is known regarding its history, except\r\nthat we have it from early settlers that an Indian known as Jim Corn\r\nseemed to be the head man of the band of Kickapoos that lived there, and\r\nthat the white pioneers frequently attended services in the old mission\r\nhouse which stood in the hollow a short distance southwest of the\r\npresent site of Oak Mills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Wards of the State of Kansas, State Orphans’ Home, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDuring the time that the Kickapoos owned and occupied what is now\r\nAtchison county, they were ruled over by two very distinguished\r\nchieftains—Keannakuk, the Prophet, and Masheena, or the Elk Horns. Both\r\nof these Indians were noted in Illinois long before they migrated\r\nwestward and were prominently mentioned by Washington Irving, George\r\nCatlin, Charles Augustus Murray and other distinguished travelers and\r\nauthors. Catlin painted their pictures in 1831, and these are included\r\nin the famous Catlin gallery in Washington. Keannakuk was both a noted\r\nchief and prophet of the tribe. He was a professed preacher of an order\r\nwhich he claimed to have originated at a very early day and his\r\ninfluence was very great among his people. He died at Kickapoo in 1852\r\nand was buried there. Masheena was a really noted Indian. He led a band\r\nof Kickapoos at the battle of Tippecanoe. He died and was buried in\r\nAtchison county, near the old town of Kennekuk, in 1857. He was born in\r\nIllinois about 1770.\r\n\r\nImportant seats of Kickapoo occupancy in Atchison county in the early\r\ndays were Kapioma, Muscotah and Kennekuk. Kapioma was named for a chief\r\nof that name who lived there. The present township of Kapioma gets its\r\nname from this source. Father John Baptiste Duerinck, a Jesuit, was a\r\nmissionary among the Kickapoos at Kapioma in 1855–57. Muscotah was for a\r\nlong time the seat of the Kickapoo agency. It is a Kickapoo name meaning\r\n“Beautiful Prairie,” or “Prairie of Fire.” Kennekuk was named for John\r\nKennekuk, a Kickapoo chief, and son of Keannakuk, the Prophet.\r\n\r\nBy treaty of 1854 the Kickapoo reservation was diminished and the tribe\r\nwas assigned to lands along the Grasshopper or Delaware river. Still\r\nlater it was again diminished and they were given their present\r\nterritory within the confines of Brown county.\r\n\r\nThe Kickapoos are a tribe of the central Algonquian group, forming a\r\ndivision with the Sauk and Foxes, with whom they have close ethnic and\r\nlinguistic connection. The first definite appearance of this tribe in\r\nhistory was about 1667–70, when they were found by Allouez near the\r\nportage between Fox and Wisconsin rivers, in Wisconsin. About 1765 they\r\nmoved down into the Illinois country, and later to Missouri and Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                          EARLY EXPLORATIONS.\r\n\r\n  CORONADO IN 1541—THE BOURGMONT EXPEDITION IN 1724—PERIN DU LAC—LEWIS\r\n      AND CLARK—FIRST FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION—MAJOR STEPHEN H. LONG—\r\n      CANTONMENT MARTIN—ISLE AU VACHE—OTHER EXPLORERS—PASCHAL PENSONEAU—\r\n      THE OLD MILITARY ROAD—THE MORMONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome historians (notably General Simpson) in their studies of the famous\r\nmarch of Coronado in search of the land of Quivira, in 1541, have\r\nbrought the great Spanish explorer to the Missouri river, in\r\nnortheastern Kansas. The more recent researches of Hodge, Bandalier and\r\nBrower, however, have proven beyond question that Coronado’s line of\r\nmarch through Kansas was north from Clark county to the Great Bend of\r\nthe Arkansas river, and thence to the region northeastward from\r\nMcPherson to the Kansas river, between the junction of its two main\r\nforks and Deep creek, in Riley county, where the long lost province of\r\nQuivira was located. Hence, it is no longer even probable that the great\r\nSpaniard on this famous march ever saw the Missouri river region in\r\nnortheastern Kansas, much less to have ever set foot upon the soil of\r\nwhat is now Atchison county, as many have heretofore believed.\r\n\r\nThe first white men, of whom we have definite record, to visit what is\r\nnow Atchison county, were those who composed the expedition of Capt.\r\nEtienne Vengard de Bourgmont, military commander of the French colony of\r\nLouisiana, who, in the summer of 1724, arrived at the Kansa Indian\r\nvillage where Doniphan now stands, crossed what is now Atchison county,\r\nand made several encampments on our soil. Leaving the Kansa village at\r\nDoniphan on the morning of July 24, en route to the province of the\r\nPadoucas, or what is now known as the Comanche tribe of Indians, in\r\nnorth central Kansas, Bourgmont and party marched a league and a half\r\nalong what is now Deer creek, and went into camp, where they spent the\r\nday. The next day they passed Stranger creek, or what they designated “a\r\nsmall river,” and stopped on account of rain, until the 26th, when they\r\nproceeded a few miles further, and again went into camp. A thunder-\r\nstorm, lasting all the afternoon, compelled them to remain encamped\r\nhere. On the 27th they reached a river, which was doubtless the\r\nGrasshopper or Delaware, about four or five miles below Muscotah, where\r\nthey again camped, and, on the 28th marched out of Atchison county\r\nsomewhere along the southwest border, in Kapioma township. This strange\r\nprocession, besides Bourgmont’s force of white men, consisted of 300\r\nIndian warriors, with two grand chiefs and fourteen war chiefs, 300\r\nIndian squaws, 500 Indian children, and 500 dogs, carrying and dragging\r\nprovisions and equipments. The object of the expedition was to promote a\r\ngeneral peace among, and effect an alliance between, the different\r\ntribes inhabitating this region. Shortly after leaving Atchison county,\r\nBourgmont was taken very ill, and was obliged to return to Fort Orleans,\r\non the lower Missouri. He was carried back across Atchison county to the\r\nKansa village, on a hand-barrow, and then transported down the Missouri\r\nin a canoe. Upon his recovery he resumed his journey to the Padoucas in\r\nthe fall of 1724, coming back by way of the Kansa village and Atchison\r\ncounty. No doubt other French explorers, traders and trappers, visited\r\nthis county at an earlier date than did Bourgmont, but information\r\nconcerning them is vague and uncertain.\r\n\r\nPerin du Lac, a French explorer, set foot upon the soil of Atchison\r\ncounty while on an exploring trip up the Missouri in 1802–03. In his\r\njournal, published soon after his return to France, Du Lac mentions that\r\n“three miles below the old Kances Indian village they perceived some\r\niron ore.” As the “old Kances village” was the one already referred to\r\nas having been at Doniphan, the iron ore discovered by Du Lac must have\r\nbeen in Atchison county, somewhere in the vicinity of Luther Dickerson’s\r\nold home, where the rocks are known to be strongly impregnated with\r\niron. Du Lac gathered some specimens of the Atchison county ore, which\r\nhe must have lost, for he says in his journal: “I intended to have\r\nassayed it on my return, but an accident unfortunately happening\r\nprevented me.”\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1804 the famous “Louisiana Purchase exploring\r\nexpedition” of Lewis and Clark passed up the Missouri river, arriving at\r\nthe southeast corner of Atchison county on July 3. They passed Isle Au\r\nVache, or Cow Island, opposite Oak Mills, stopped at a deserted trader’s\r\nhouse at or near the site of Port William, where they picked up a stray\r\nhorse (the first recorded mention of a horse in what is now Atchison\r\ncounty) and camped that night somewhere in the vicinity of Walnut creek.\r\nThe next morning they announced the “glorious Fourth” with a shot from\r\ntheir gun boat, and there began the first celebration of our Nation’s\r\nbirthday on Kansas soil. That day they took dinner on the bank of White\r\nClay creek, or what they called “Fourth of July creek.” Here Joe Fields,\r\na member of the party, was bitten by a snake, and Sergeant Floyd, in\r\ncommemoration of the incident, named the prairie on which Atchison now\r\nstands, “Joe Fields’ Snake Prairie.” Above the creek, they state, “was a\r\nhigh mound, where three Indian paths centered, and from which was a very\r\nextensive prospect.” This, undoubtedly, was the commanding elevation\r\nwhere the Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home now stands. On the evening of the\r\nFourth they discovered and named Independence creek in honor of the day,\r\nand closed the day’s observances with “an evening gun and an additional\r\ngill of whiskey to the men.”\r\n\r\nA detachment of Maj. Stephen H. Long’s Yellowstone exploring expedition,\r\nunder command of Capt. Wyley Martin, spent the winter of 1818–19 on Cow\r\nIsland, which now belongs to Atchison county, and established a post\r\nknown as Cantonment Martin. This was the first United States military\r\npost established above Ft. Osage, and west of Missouri Territory. During\r\nthat winter Captain Martin’s men killed between 2,000 and 3,000 deer,\r\nbesides great numbers of bears, turkeys and other game. The troops that\r\nestablished this frontier post were a part of the First Rifle regiment,\r\nthe “crack” organization of the United States army at that time. In\r\nJuly, 1819, Major Long arrived at Cow Island. His steamboats were the\r\nfirst to ascend the Missouri river above Ft. Osage. The next day Colonel\r\nChambers and a detachment of infantry arrived. Thomas Say and his party\r\nof naturalists, under command of Major Biddle, at about the same time\r\ncrossed Atchison county en route from the Kansa Indian village where\r\nManhattan now stands, and joined Major Long’s party at Cow Island.\r\nMessrs. Say and Jessup, naturalists of the expedition, were taken very\r\nill and had to remain at the island for some time. Col. Henry Atkinson,\r\nthe founder of Ft. Atkinson, and commander of the western department for\r\nmore than twenty years, arrived at Cow Island shortly after Major Long.\r\nMaj. John O’Fallon was sutler of the post and Indian agent for the upper\r\nMissouri. On July 4, 1819, the Nation’s birthday was celebrated on Cow\r\nIsland. The flags were raised at full mast, guns were fired, and they\r\nhad “pig with divers tarts to grace the table.” On August 24 an\r\nimportant council with the Kansa Indians was held on the island. An\r\naccount of this council will be found in the chapter on Indian history\r\nin this volume.\r\n\r\nOne of the captains who was stationed on Cow Island—Bennett Riley—\r\nafterwards became a distinguished man in the history of this country. He\r\nwas the man for whom Ft. Riley was named. He served with gallantry in\r\nthe Indian country, the Northwest and Florida. In the Florida war he was\r\npromoted to colonel. In the war with Mexico he became a major-general,\r\nand was subsequently military governor of California. Col. John O’Fallon\r\nentered the army from Kentucky and fought in the Battle of Tippecanoe\r\nunder Harrison, where he was severely wounded and carried the scar to\r\nhis grave. He had a brilliant military record, and afterwards became one\r\nof the wealthiest and most public-spirited citizens of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nMajor Willoughby Morgan assumed command of the Cow Island post April 13,\r\n1819. He was also a distinguished officer. When Cantonment Martin was\r\nabandoned in September, 1819, it required a month to transport the\r\ntroops from there to Council Bluffs on the steamboats.\r\n\r\nOne of these boats, the “Western Engineer,” the first that ever touched\r\nthe shore of Atchison county, was of unique construction, having been\r\nexpressly built for the expedition and calculated to impress the\r\nIndians. On her bow was the exhaust pipe, made in the form of a huge\r\nserpent, with wide open mouth and tongue painted a fiery red. The steam,\r\nescaping through the mouth, made a loud, wheezing noise that could be\r\nheard for miles. The Indians recognized in it the power of the great\r\nManitou and were overcome with fear.\r\n\r\nCow Island has been a prominent landmark in the West from a very early\r\nperiod. It was discovered by the early French explorers and called by\r\nthem Isle au Vache, meaning Isle of Cow or Cow Island. It was so named\r\nbecause a stray cow was found wandering about on the island. It is\r\nsupposed that this cow was stolen by the Indians from one of the early\r\nFrench settlements and placed on this island to prevent her escape.\r\nThere is a coincidence in the fact that the first horse and the first\r\ncow in what is now Atchison county, of which we have any record, were\r\nfound in the same locality. The stray horse picked up by Lewis and\r\nClark, mention of which is made on a preceding page of this chapter, was\r\nfound almost opposite the upper end of Cow Island, on the Kansas shore.\r\nThere is a tradition that the French had a trading post on Cow Island at\r\na very early day.\r\n\r\nIn 1810, John Bradbury, a renowned English botanist, made a trip up the\r\nMissouri river, and was the first scientist to make a systematic study\r\nof the plants and geological formations of this region. He touched the\r\nshore of what is now Atchison county, and in his book, “Travels in the\r\nInterior of America,” speaks about the great fertility of our soil. He\r\nshipped the specimens collected on this trip to the botanical gardens of\r\nLiverpool, and no doubt many Atchison county specimens were included in\r\nthese shipments. The next year H. M. Brackenridge, another explorer,\r\ncame up the Missouri and made some observations along our shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Postoffice, Atchison, Kansas\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first permanent white settler of what is now Atchison county was a\r\nFrenchman, Paschal Pensoneau, who, about 1839, married a Kickapoo Indian\r\nwoman and about 1844 settled on the bank of Stranger creek, near the\r\npresent site of Potter, where he established a trading-house and opened\r\nthe first farm in Atchison county on land which had been allotted him by\r\nthe Government for services in the Black Hawk and Mexican wars.\r\nPensoneau had long lived among the Kickapoo Indians, following them in\r\ntheir migrations from Illinois to Missouri and Kansas, generally\r\npursuing the vocation of trader and interpreter. As early as 1833 or\r\n1834 he was established on the Missouri river at the old Kickapoo town,\r\nlater removing to Stranger creek, as aforestated. He became a very\r\nprominent and influential man among the Kickapoos. He long held the\r\nposition of Government interpreter that tribe. After the treaty of 1854,\r\ndiminishing the Kickapoo reserve, Pensoneau moved to the new lands\r\nassigned the tribe along the Grasshopper river, where he lived for many\r\nyears. About 1875 he settled among a band of Kickapoo Indians, near\r\nShawnee, Indian Territory, where he died some years later. He was born\r\nat Cahokia, Ill., April 17, 1796, his parents having been among the\r\nemigrants from Canada to the early French settlements of Illinois.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the military road from Ft. Leavenworth to Ft. Laramie was laid\r\nout by Colonel Ogden. It crossed Atchison county, and over it passed\r\nmany important expeditions to the Western plains and mountains, and to\r\nOregon and California. Before this road was laid out as a Government\r\nhighway, the same route had long been traveled as a trail. It was a\r\ngreat natural highway, being on the “dividing ridge” between the\r\nMissouri and Kansas rivers. Charles Augustus Murray, Francis Parkman,\r\nCaptain Stansbury and other noted travelers journeyed over this trail\r\nduring the thirties and forties, and in the fascinating volumes they\r\nhave left, we find much of interest pertaining to the region of which\r\nAtchison county is now a part. During the gold excitement in California\r\nthis old trail swarmed with emigrants seeking a fortune in the West. The\r\nMormons, the soldiers, the overland freighters, the stage drivers, the\r\nhundred and one other picturesque types of character in the early West\r\nhave helped to make the history of this famous old branch of the “Oregon\r\nand California Trail” immortalized by Parkman.\r\n\r\nDuring the days of Mormon emigration a Mormon settlement sprang up a few\r\nmiles west of Atchison, and immediately east of the present site of\r\nShannon, which became known as “Mormon Grove.” The settlement was\r\nenclosed by trenches, which served as fences to prevent the stock from\r\ngoing astray, and traces of these old ditches may be seen to this day.\r\nMany of the Mormons here died of cholera and were buried near the\r\nsettlement, but all traces of the old burial ground have been\r\nobliterated by cultivation of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                           TERRITORIAL TIMES.\r\n\r\n  TERRITORY ACQUIRED FROM FRANCE IN 1803—ORGANIZATION OF TERRITORY—\r\n      KANSAS-NEBRASKA ACT—IMMIGRATION TO KANSAS—TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT—\r\n      FREE STATE AND PRO-SLAVERY CONFLICT—FIRST ELECTION—SECRET\r\n      POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS—BORDER WAR ACTIVITIES AND OUTRAGES—\r\n      CONTESTS OVER ADOPTION OF CONSTITUTION—KANSAS ADMITTED TO THE\r\n      UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nKansas is as rich in historic lore and resources as any other region of\r\nthe great West. George J. Remsburg, who has contributed two chapters of\r\nthis history, has, with great care and accuracy, put into readable form\r\nan account of prehistoric times, Indian occupancy and the record of\r\nearlier explorers in northeastern Kansas. It is a tale of absorbing\r\ninterest to those who would go back to the dawn of civilization here and\r\nstudy the force and character of men who paved the way for the\r\ndevelopments that came after. To the intrepid Spanish conquerors of\r\nMexico of the sixteenth century, and the hardy French explorers, two\r\ncenturies later, we are indebted for the opening up of the Great\r\nAmerican Desert, into which American pioneers, the century following,\r\nfound their way. Thousands of years before these came, Atchison county\r\nhad been the abode of hunting tribes and the feasting place of wild\r\nanimals. Then came the ceaseless flow of the tide of civilization, which\r\nswept these earlier denizens from the field, to clear it for the\r\n“momentous conflict between the two opposing systems of American\r\ncivilization, then struggling for mastery and supremacy over the\r\nRepublic.” It was in Kansas that the war of rebellion began, and it was\r\nin the northeastern corner along the shores of the Missouri river—in\r\nAtchison county—“that the spark of conflict which had irritated a Nation\r\nfor decades burst into devastating flames.”\r\n\r\nIt is a delicate task to convey anything approaching a truthful account\r\nof the storm and stress of opinions and emotions which accompanied the\r\norganization of Kansas as one of the great American commonwealths, and\r\nthe part played by the citizens of Atchison county in that tremendous\r\nwork, but sixty years have served to mellow the animosities and\r\nbitternesses of the past, and it is easier now to comprehend the strife\r\nof that distant day and pass unbiased judgment upon it.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States acquired from France, in 1803, the territory of\r\nwhich Atchison county is a part, slavery was a legalized institution,\r\nand many of the residents held slaves. In the treaty of cession, there\r\nwas incorporated an expressed stipulation that the inhabitants of\r\nLouisiana “should be incorporated into the Union of the United States\r\nand admitted as soon as possible, according to the principles of the\r\nFederal Constitution, to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages and\r\nimmunities of citizens of the United States, and in the meantime they\r\nshould be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their\r\nliberty, property and the religion which they professed.” Thus it came\r\nto pass for over fifty years after the time that vast empire was\r\nacquired from France the bitter contest between the anti-slavery and the\r\npro-slavery advocates ebbed and flowed, and amidst a continual clash of\r\nideas and finally after the shedding of blood, Kansas, and Atchison\r\ncounty, were born.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Thirty-second Congress that petitions were presented for\r\nthe organization of the Territory of the Platte, viz: all that tract\r\nlying west of Iowa and Missouri and extending west to the Rocky\r\nmountains, but no action on the petitions was taken at that time.\r\nDecember 13, 1852, Willard P. Hall, a congressman from Missouri,\r\nsubmitted to the House of Representatives a bill organizing this region.\r\nThis bill was referred to the committee on territories, which reported\r\nFebruary 22, 1853, through its chairman, William A. Richardson, of\r\nIllinois. A bill organizing the territory of Nebraska, which covered the\r\nsame territory as the bill of Mr. Hall, was met by unexpected and strong\r\nopposition from the southern members of Congress, and was rejected in\r\nthe committee of the whole. The House, however, did not adopt the action\r\nof the committee, but passed the bill and sent it to the Senate, where\r\nit was defeated March 3, 1853, by six votes. On the fourteenth day of\r\nDecember, 1853, Senator Dodge, of Iowa, submitted to that body a new\r\nbill for the organization of the territory of Nebraska, embracing the\r\nsame region as the bill which was defeated in the first session of the\r\nThirty-second Congress. It was referred to the committee on territories,\r\nof which Stephen A. Douglas was chairman, on January 4, 1854.\r\n\r\nIt was during the discussion of this bill that the abrogation of the\r\nMissouri Compromise was foreshadowed. The story of the action of Senator\r\nDouglas in connection with the slavery question has appeared in every\r\nhistory since the Civil war. It is neither necessary nor proper to dwell\r\nat length upon his career in connection with the history of Atchison\r\ncounty. However, it was following a bitter discussion of the slavery\r\nquestion that the bill was passed, creating Kansas a territory. The\r\nprovisions of the bill, as presented, were known to be in accordance\r\nwith the wishes and designs of all the Southern members to have been\r\naccepted before being presented by President Pierce by a majority of the\r\nmembers of his cabinet, and to have the assured support of a sufficient\r\nnumber of Northern administration Democrats, to insure its passage\r\nbeyond a doubt. The contest over the measure ended May 27, 1854, by the\r\npassage of the bill, which was approved May 30, 1854, by President\r\nPierce.\r\n\r\nThe act organizing Nebraska and Kansas contained thirty-seven sections.\r\nThe provisions relating to Kansas were embodied in the last eighteen\r\nsections, summarized as follow:\r\n\r\nSection 19 defines the boundaries of the territory; gives it the name of\r\nKansas, and prescribes that when admitted as a State, or States, the\r\nsaid territory, or any portion of the same, shall be received into the\r\nUnion with or without slavery, as their constitution may prescribe at\r\nthe time of their admission. Also provides for holding the rights of all\r\nIndian tribes inviolable, until such time as they shall be extinguished\r\nby treaty.\r\n\r\nSection 20. The executive power and authority is vested in a governor,\r\nappointed by the President, to hold his office for the term of four\r\nyears, or until his successor is appointed and qualified, unless sooner\r\nremoved by the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nSection 21. The secretary of State is appointed and subject to removal\r\nby the President of the United States, and to be acting governor with\r\nfull powers and functions of the governor in case of the absence of the\r\ngovernor from the territory, or a vacancy occurring.\r\n\r\nSection 22. Legislative power and authority of territory is vested in\r\nthe governor and a legislative body, consisting of two branches, a\r\ncouncil and a house of representatives.\r\n\r\nSection 23 prescribes qualifications of voters; giving the right to\r\nevery free white male inhabitant, above the age of 21 years, who shall\r\nbe an actual resident of the territory, to vote at the first election.\r\n\r\nSection 24 limits the scope of territorial legislation, and defines the\r\nveto power of the governor.\r\n\r\nSection 25 prescribes the manner of appointing and electing officers,\r\nnot otherwise provided for.\r\n\r\nSection 26 precludes members from holding any office created or the\r\nemoluments of which are increased during any session of the legislature\r\nof which they are a member, and prescribes qualifications for members of\r\nthe legislative assembly.\r\n\r\nSection 27 vests the judicial power in the supreme court, district\r\ncourts, probate courts and in justices of the peace.\r\n\r\nSection 28 declares the fugitive slave law of 1850 to be in full force\r\nin the territory.\r\n\r\nSection 29 provides for the appointment of an attorney and marshal for\r\nthe territory.\r\n\r\nSection 30 treats with the nomination of the President, chief justice,\r\nassociate justices, attorney and marshal, and their confirmation by the\r\nSenate, and prescribes the duties of these officers and fixes their\r\nsalaries.\r\n\r\nSection 31 locates the temporary seat of government of the territory at\r\nFt. Leavenworth, and authorizes the use of the Government buildings\r\nthere for public purposes.\r\n\r\nSection 32 provides for the election of a delegate to Congress, and\r\nabrogates the Missouri Compromise.\r\n\r\nSection 33 prescribes the manner and the amount of appropriations for\r\nthe erection of public buildings, and other territorial purposes.\r\n\r\nSection 34 reserves for the benefit of schools in the territory and\r\nstates and territories hereafter to be erected out of the same, sections\r\nnumber 16 and 30 in each township, as they are surveyed.\r\n\r\nSection 35 prescribes the mode of defining the judicial districts of the\r\nterritory, and appointing the times and places of holding the various\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nSection 36 requires officers to give official bonds, in such manner as\r\nthe secretary of treasury may prescribe.\r\n\r\nSection 37 declares all treaties, laws and other engagements made by the\r\nUnited States Government with the Indian tribes inhabiting the territory\r\nto remain inviolate, notwithstanding anything contained in the\r\nprovisions of the act.\r\n\r\nIt was under the provisions of the above act that those coming to Kansas\r\nto civilize it and to erect their homes were to be guided.\r\n\r\nEdward Everett Hale, in his history of Kansas and Nebraska, published in\r\n1854, says, “Up to the summer of 1834, Kansas and Nebraska have had no\r\ncivilized residents, except the soldiers sent to keep the Indian tribes\r\nin order; the missionaries sent to convert them; the traders who bought\r\nfurs of them, and those of the natives who may be considered to have\r\nattained some measure of civilization from their connection with the\r\nwhites.” So it will be seen that at the time of the passage of the\r\nKansas-Nebraska act, Atchison county was very sparsely settled.\r\n\r\nAll movements in the territory, or elsewhere, made for its organization,\r\nwere provisional, as they were subject to the rights of the various\r\nIndian tribes, whose reservations covered, by well defined boundaries,\r\nevery acre of northeastern Kansas, except such tracts as were reserved\r\nby the Government about Ft. Leavenworth, and other military stations,\r\nbut with the move for the organization of the territory came an effort\r\nto extinguish the Indian’s title to the lands and thus open them to\r\nwhite settlers. One of the most interesting books bearing upon the\r\nhistory of Kansas of that time was “Greeley’s Conflict.” He makes the\r\nfollowing statement with reference to this subject:\r\n\r\n“When the bill organizing Kansas and Nebraska was first submitted to\r\nCongress in 1853, all that portion of Kansas which adjoins the State of\r\nMissouri, and, in fact, nearly all the accessible portion of both\r\nterritories, was covered by Indian reservations, on which settlement by\r\nwhites was strictly forbidden. The only exception was in favor of\r\nGovernment agents and religious missionaries; and these, especially the\r\nformer, were nearly all Democrats and violent partisans of slavery.\r\n* * * * Within three months immediately preceding the passage of the\r\nKansas bill aforesaid, treaties were quietly made at Washington with the\r\nDelawares, Otoes, Kickapoos, Kaskaskias, Shawnees, Sacs, Foxes and other\r\ntribes, whereby the greater part of the soil of Kansas, lying within one\r\nor two hundred miles of the Missouri border, was suddenly opened to\r\nwhite appropriation and settlement. These simultaneous purchases of the\r\nIndian land by the Government, though little was known of them\r\nelsewhere, were thoroughly understood and appreciated by the Missourians\r\nof the western border, who had for some time been organizing ‘Blue\r\nLodges,’ ‘Social Bands,’ ‘Sons of the South,’ and other societies, with\r\nintent to take possession of Kansas in behalf of slavery. They were well\r\nassured and they fully believed that the object contemplated and\r\ndesired, in lifting, by the terms of the Kansas-Nebraska bill, the\r\ninterdict of slavery from Kansas, was to authorize and facilitate the\r\nlegal extension of slavery into that region. Within a few days after the\r\npassage of the Kansas-Nebraska act, hundreds of leading Missourians\r\ncrossed into the adjacent territory, selected each his quarter section,\r\nor a larger area of land, put some sort of mark on it, and then united\r\nwith his fellow-adventurers in a meeting, or meetings, intended to\r\nestablish a sort of Missouri preëmption upon all this region.”\r\n\r\nImmediately following the passage of the territorial act the immigration\r\nof Missourians to Kansas began, and, indeed, before its final passage\r\nthe best of the lands had been located and marked for preëmption by the\r\nMissourians. This was true, apparently, in the case of George M.\r\nMillion, whom the records disclose was the first settler in Atchison\r\ncounty, after Kansas was made a territory. Mr. Million was of German\r\ndescent and came to the vicinity of Rushville in the hills east of\r\nAtchison from Coal county, Missouri, prior to 1841, where he was married\r\nto Sarah E. Dixon before she was fifteen years old. In 1841 Million\r\noccupied the present site of East Atchison as a farm. At that time the\r\nbottom land just east of Atchison was covered with tall rushes and was\r\nknown as Rush bottom. The town of Rushville was originally known as\r\nColumbus, but the name was subsequently changed to Rushville because of\r\nthe character of the country in which it was located. During the winter\r\nMillion eked out his livelihood by cutting wood and hauling it to the\r\nriver bank, selling it in the spring and summer to the steamboats that\r\nplied up and down the Missouri river. Sometime subsequent to 1841,\r\nMillion built a flat-boat ferry and operated it for seven or eight years\r\nand did a thriving business during the great gold rush to California. He\r\naccumulated considerable money and later operated a store, trading with\r\nthe Indians for furs and buying hemp, which he shipped down the river.\r\nIn June, 1854, he “squatted” on the present townsite of Atchison, and\r\nbuilt a log house at the foot of Atchison street, near his ferry\r\nlanding, and just opposite his cabin on the Missouri side of the river.\r\nFollowing Million, in June, 1854 came a colony of emigrants from Iatan,\r\nMo., and took up claims in the neighborhood of Oak Mills. They were F.\r\nP. Goddard, G. B. Goddard, James Douglass, Allen Hanson and George A.\r\nWright, but the actual settlers and founders of Atchison county did not\r\nenter the territory of Kansas until July, 1854. On the twentieth day of\r\nthat month Dr. J. H. Stringfellow with Ira Norris, Leonidas Oldham,\r\nJames B. Martin and Neil Owens left Platte City, Mo., to decide\r\ndefinitely upon a good location for a town. With the exception of Dr.\r\nStringfellow they all took claims about four miles southwest of the\r\npresent city of Atchison. Traveling in a southwesterly direction from\r\nPlatte City the party reached the river opposite Ft. Leavenworth and\r\ncrossed to the Kansas side. They went north until they reached the mouth\r\nof Walnut creek, “and John Alcorn’s lonely cabin upon its banks.” They\r\ncontinued their course up the river until they came to the “south edge\r\nof the rim of the basin which circles around from the south line of the\r\ncity, extending west by gradual incline to the divide between White Clay\r\nand Stranger creek, then north and east around to the northern limits of\r\nthe city.” It was at this point that the Missouri river made the bend\r\nfrom the northeast, throwing the point where Atchison is now located,\r\ntwelve miles west of any locality, north, and twenty miles west of\r\nLeavenworth, and thirty-five miles west of Kansas City. When they\r\ndescended into the valley, of which Commercial street is now the lowest\r\npoint, Dr. Stringfellow and his companions found George M. Million and\r\nSamuel Dickson. Mr. Dickson followed Million to Kansas from Rushville,\r\nand while there is some dispute as to who was the second resident in\r\nAtchison county after the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska bill, the best\r\nauthorities lead to the conclusion that to Samuel Dickson belongs that\r\nhonor. Mr. Dickson erected a small shanty near the spring, which bore\r\nhis name for so many years, on the east side of South Sixth street,\r\nbetween Park and Spring streets. His house is described as a structure\r\ntwelve feet square, having one door and one window and a large stone\r\nchimney running up the outside. As soon as Dr. Stringfellow arrived he\r\nat once commenced negotiations with Mr. Million for the purchase of his\r\nclaim. Mr. Million, apparently, was a shrewd real estate speculator and\r\nonly surrendered his claim upon the payment of $1,000. Dr. Stringfellow\r\nconsidered this a very fancy figure for the land, but he and his\r\nassociates were firm in their decision of founding a city at this point\r\non the Missouri river and they gave Mr. Million his price. The\r\norganization of a town company which followed will be discussed in a\r\nsubsequent chapter of this territory.\r\n\r\nThe first territorial appointment for the purpose of inaugurating a\r\nlocal government in Kansas was made in June, 1854. Governor Andrew. H.\r\nReeder, of Easton, Pa., was appointed on that date. He took the oath of\r\noffice in Washington, D. C., July 7, and arrived in Kansas at Ft.\r\nLeavenworth October 7, becoming at once the executive head of the Kansas\r\ngovernment. Governor Reeder was a stranger to Kansas. With the exception\r\nof Senator Atchison he scarcely knew anybody in Kansas. He was a lawyer\r\nby profession, one of the ablest in the State of Pennsylvania. From\r\nearly manhood he had been an ardent and loyal Democrat and had defended\r\nwith vigor and great power the principle of squatter sovereignty and the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill. He was not a politician and was an able, honest,\r\nclear-thinking Democrat. Upon his arrival in Kansas he set himself at\r\nonce to the task of inaugurating the government in the territory.\r\nAccording to his own testimony before the special congressional\r\ncommittee appointed by Congress to investigate the troubles in Kansas in\r\n1856, he made it his first business to obtain information of the\r\ngeography, settlements, population and general condition of the\r\nterritory, with a view to its division into districts; the defining of\r\ntheir boundary; the location of suitable and central places for\r\nelections, and the full names of men in each district for election\r\nofficers, persons to take the census, justices of the peace, and\r\nconstables. He accordingly made a tour of the territory, and although he\r\ndid not come to Atchison county his tour included many important and\r\nremote settlements in the territory. Upon his return he concluded that\r\nif the election for a delegate to Congress should be postponed until an\r\nelection could be had for the legislature, which, in the one case\r\nrequired no previous census, and in the other a census was required, the\r\ngreater part of the session of Congress, which would terminate on the\r\nfourth of March, would expire before a congressional delegate from the\r\nterritory could reach Washington. He, therefore, ordered an election for\r\na delegate to Congress, and postponed the taking of the census until\r\nafter that election. He prepared, without unnecessary delay, a division\r\nof the territory into election districts, fixed a place of election in\r\neach, appointed election officers and ordered that the election should\r\ntake place November 29, 1854. Atchison county was in the fifteenth\r\nelection district, which comprised the following territory: Commencing\r\nat the mouth of Salt creek on the Missouri river; thence up said creek\r\nto the military road and along the middle of said road to the lower\r\ncrossing of Stranger creek: thence up said creek to the line of the\r\nKickapoo reservation, and thence along the southern and western line\r\nthereof to the line of the fourteenth district: thence between same, and\r\ndown Independence creek to the mouth thereof, and thence down the\r\nMissouri river to the place of beginning. The place of the election was\r\nat the house of Pascal Pensoneau, on the Ft. Leavenworth and Oregon\r\nroad, near what is now the town site of Potter. The election which\r\nfollowed was an exciting one. Public meetings were held in all of the\r\ntowns and villages, at which resolutions were passed against the eastern\r\nabolitionists, the _Platte County Argus_ sounding the following alarm:\r\n\r\n“We know we speak the sentiments of some of the most distinguished\r\nstatesmen of Missouri when we advise that counter-organizations be made,\r\nboth in Kansas and Missouri, to thwart the reckless course of the\r\nabolitionists. We must meet them at their very threshold and scourge\r\nthem back to their covers of darkness. They have made the issue, and it\r\nis for us to meet and repel them.”\r\n\r\nThe secret organizations, of which Greeley spoke, known as the “Blue\r\nLodges,” “Social Bands,” and “Sons of the South,” became very active,\r\nand knowing the condition of affairs along the Missouri border, and\r\nhaving learned the needs and wishes of the actual settlers in the\r\nterritory, Governor Reeder decided that their rights should not be\r\njeopardized. Therefore, in ordering an election of a congressional\r\ndelegate only, with the idea of a later proclamation ordering a\r\nterritorial election of a legislature, he knew that much trouble would\r\nbe spared. In his proclamation for the congressional election, provision\r\nwas made for defining the qualifications of legal voters, and providing\r\nagainst fraud, both of which provisions were received with alarm by the\r\nleaders of the slavery Democracy, who, up to that time had hoped that\r\nthe administration at Washington had sent them an ally. It was not long\r\nuntil they discovered that they were mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe actual settlers of the territory did not evince much interest in the\r\nelection. They were all engaged in what appeared to them to be the more\r\nimportant business of building their homes and otherwise providing\r\nnecessities before the approach of winter. There were no party\r\norganizations in the territory. The slavery question was not generally\r\nunderstood to be an issue. The first candidates to announce themselves\r\nwere James N. Burnes, whose name has for sixty years been prominently\r\nidentified with the social, political and business history of Atchison\r\ncounty, and J. B. Chapman. These two candidates subsequently withdrew\r\nfrom the campaign, and the names finally submitted to the voters were:\r\nGen. John W. Whitfield, Robert P. Flenneken, Judge John A. Wakefield.\r\nWhitfield ignored the slavery issue during his canvass, but his cause\r\nwas openly espoused by the Missourians. Flenneken was a friend of\r\nGovernor Reeder, with Free Soil proclivities. Wakefield was an outspoken\r\nFree-Soiler. Hon. David R. Atchison, then a United States senator, and\r\nfor whom Atchison county was named, was the head and front of the pro-\r\nslavery movement. He had a national reputation and was a power in the\r\nUnited States Senate, and won for himself the highest position in the\r\ngift of the Senate, having been chosen president protempore of that body\r\nafter the death of Vice-President King. He was loyal to the southern\r\nviews regarding slavery and this made him the unquestioned leader of the\r\nparty which believed, as Senator Atchison himself believed, that the\r\npassage of the Kansas-Nebraska bill would inevitably result in a slave\r\nState west of Missouri. It was to Senator Atchison that Dr. J. H.\r\nStringfellow, himself one of the strong leaders of the pro-slavery\r\nforces, looked for inspiration and direction. In a speech Senator\r\nAtchison made in Weston, Mo., November 6, 1854, which was just prior to\r\nthe congressional election in Kansas, he said:\r\n\r\n“My mission here today is, if possible, to awaken the people of this\r\ncountry to the danger ahead and to suggest the means to avoid it. The\r\npeople of Kansas in their first elections will decide the question\r\nwhether or not the slave-holder was to be excluded, and it depends upon\r\na majority of the votes cast at the polls. Now, if a set of fanatics and\r\ndemagogues a thousand miles off could afford to advance their money and\r\nexert every nerve to abolitionize the territory and exclude the slave-\r\nholder, when they have not the least personal interest in the matter,\r\nwhat is your duty? When you reside within one day’s journey of the\r\nterritory, and when your peace, your quiet, and your property depend\r\nupon this action you can without any exertion send five hundred of your\r\nyoung men who will vote in favor of your institutions.”\r\n\r\nOn November 28, the day preceding the election, the secret society\r\nvoters in Missouri began to cross over into Kansas. They came organized\r\nto carry the election and in such overwhelming numbers as to completely\r\nover-awe and out-number the legal voters of the territory at many of the\r\nprecincts. They took possession of the polls, elected many of the\r\njudges, intimidated others to resign and refusing to take the oath\r\nqualifying themselves as voters and prescribe to the regulations of the\r\nelection, cast their ballots for General John W. Whitfield and hastily\r\nbeat their retreat to Missouri. The whole number of votes cast in that\r\nelection was 2,233, of which number Whitfield received 2,258; Wakefield,\r\n248; Flenneken, 305, with twenty-two scattering votes. The frauds which\r\nwere at first denied by both the pro-slavery newspapers and General\r\nWhitfield himself, were not long in being discovered.\r\n\r\nIn the Fifteenth district, of which Atchison county was a part, the\r\ntotal number of votes cast was 306, of which Wakefield got none;\r\nFlenneken, 39, and Whitfield, 267. The total number of votes given by\r\nthe census was 308, and in the majority report of the congressional\r\ncommittee of the following year 206 illegal votes were shown to have\r\nbeen cast in that district. However, there was little immediate\r\ndisturbance following the election. The settlers continued to busy\r\nthemselves in completing their homes and were more interested in\r\nsecuring titles to their lands than in the future destiny of the\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIn the following January and February Governor Reeder caused an\r\nenumeration of the inhabitants to be taken preparatory to calling an\r\nelection for a legislature. H. B. Jolly was named as enumerator for the\r\nFifteenth district and Mr. Jolly found a total of 873 persons in the\r\ndistrict, divided as follows: Males, 492; females, 381; voters, 308;\r\nminors, 448; natives of the United States, 846; foreign born, sixteen;\r\nnegroes, fifteen; slaves, fifteen. The date appointed for the\r\nlegislative election was March 30, 1855. The proclamation of the\r\ngovernor defined the election districts; appointed the voting precincts;\r\nnamed the judges of the election, defined the duties of the judges, and\r\nthe qualifications of voters. Thirteen members of the council and\r\ntwenty-six members of the house of representatives were to constitute\r\nthe legislative assembly of the territory. Atchison was in the Ninth\r\ncouncil district and in the Thirteenth representative district.\r\nFollowing the precedent established in the election for congressional\r\ndelegate the November before the blue lodges of Missouri became active\r\nand large numbers of members of the secret societies of Missouri were\r\nsent into every council and representative district in the territory for\r\nthe purpose of controlling the election. They were armed and came with\r\nprovisions and tents. They overpowered and intimidated the resident\r\nvoters to such an extent that only 1,410 legal votes were cast in the\r\nterritory out of 2,905 enumerated in the census.\r\n\r\nD. A. N. Grover was the pro-slavery candidate for councilman in the\r\nNinth Council district with no opposition and he received 411 votes\r\nwhich was the total number of votes enumerated for that district. H. B.\r\nC. Harris and J. Weddell were the pro-slavery candidates for\r\nrepresentative in the Thirteenth district with no opposition. They each\r\nreceived 412 votes, being the total number of votes enumerated in the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nIt was another victory for the pro-slavery sympathizers and the Free\r\nState men were indignant, while on the other hand the pro-slavery\r\nresidents, with their Missouri allies, did not conceal their joy, at the\r\nsame time admitting frankly the outrages which were practiced at the\r\npolls. The _Leavenworth Herald_ of April 6 headed its election returns\r\nwith the following:\r\n\r\n               “All Hail.\r\n               Pro-Slavery Party Victorious.\r\n               We have met the enemy, and they are ours.\r\n               Veni Vidi Vici!\r\n               Free White State Party used up.\r\n\r\n“The triumph of the pro-slavery party is complete and overwhelming. Come\r\non, Southern men; bring your slaves and fill up the territory. Kansas is\r\nSaved! Abolitionism is rebuked. Her fortress stormed. Her flag is\r\ndragging in the dust. The tri-colored platform has fallen with a crash.\r\nThe rotten timbers of its structure were not sufficient to sustain the\r\nsmall fragments of the party.”\r\n\r\nThe _Parkville Luminary_ which was published in Platte county, Missouri,\r\nvery mildly protested against the manner of carrying the election and\r\nspoke in friendly terms of the Free Soil settlers. The following week\r\nits office and place was destroyed by a mob and forced its editors to\r\nflee the country for their lives.\r\n\r\nThe election of November 29, 1854, so incensed the Anti-Slavery element\r\nthat the Free State movement was given a great impetus. A convention of\r\nFree State men at Lawrence June 8, 1855, and the Big Springs convention\r\nSeptember 5, 1855, were the result, and from that date many other public\r\nmeetings of Free State men followed. The Free State sentiment fully\r\ncrystalized itself in the momentous election of October 9, 1855,\r\nfollowing eight days after the date set by the pro-slavery legislature\r\nfor an election of delegate to Congress to succeed J. W. Whitfield, who\r\nhad been elected the year before. The first election in 1855 was held\r\nOctober 1 but was participated in only by pro-slavery men. The abstract\r\nof the poll books showed that 2,738 votes were cast in the territory and\r\nWhitfield received 2,721, of which it is only fair to say that 857 were\r\ndeclared illegal. In the Free State election Ex-Governor Andrew H.\r\nReeder received 2,849 votes, of which 101 were cast in Atchison county.\r\nOn the same day an election for delegates to a constitutional convention\r\nto be held at Topeka took place and R. H. Crosby, a merchant of Oceana,\r\nAtchison county, and Caleb May, a farmer, near the same place, were\r\nelected delegates.\r\n\r\nThe returns of the pro-slavery election having been made according to\r\nlaw, the governor granted the certificate of election to Whitfield, who\r\nreturned to Washington as the duly elected delegate from Kansas. The\r\nterritorial executive committee, elected at the Big Springs convention,\r\ngave a certificate of election to Reeder. The Topeka constitutional\r\nconvention subsequently convened October 23, 1855, and was in session\r\nuntil November 11. This body of Free State men framed a constitution,\r\nand among other things memorialized Congress to admit Kansas as a State.\r\nIt was understood by all that the validity of the work of the convention\r\nwas contingent upon the admission of Kansas as a State. Meanwhile the\r\nexecutive committee of Kansas Territory appointed at the Topeka primary,\r\nSeptember 19, 1855, under the leadership of James H. Lane, continued to\r\ndirect and inspire the work for a State government.\r\n\r\nAs a counter-irritant to the activities of the Free State men, and for\r\nthe purpose of allaying the insane excitement of the territorial\r\nlegislature, the pro-slavery followers organized a Law and Order party,\r\nwhich was pledged to the establishment of slavery in Kansas. From\r\nthenceforth it was open warfare between the two great forces contending\r\nfor supremacy in the territory. Atchison was the stronghold of the Law\r\nand Order party, as Lawrence was the stronghold of the Free State party.\r\nThe Free State party was looked upon by the Law and Order advocates as\r\nmade up of revolutionists and the Law and Order party was determined to\r\nbring them to time as soon as possible, but as the members of the Free\r\nState party held themselves apart from the legal machinery devised for\r\nthe government of the territory, bringing no suits in its courts;\r\nattending no elections; paying no attention to its county organizations;\r\noffering no estates to its probate judges, and paying no tax levies made\r\nby authority of the legislature, they were careful to commit no act\r\nwhich would lay themselves liable to the laws which they abhorred. They\r\nsettled all their disputes by arbitration in order to avoid litigation,\r\nbut as they could build, manufacture, buy and sell and establish schools\r\nand churches without coming under the domination of the pro-slavery\r\nforces, they managed to do tolerably well. Where the inhabitants were\r\nmostly Free State, as in Lawrence and Topeka, conditions were reasonably\r\nsatisfactory, but in localities like Atchison and Leavenworth, where the\r\nLaw and Order party dominated affairs, the Free State inhabitants were\r\nforced to suffer many indignities and insults.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of August, 1855, a negro woman belonging to Grafton\r\nThomassen, who ran a sawmill in Atchison, was found drowned in the\r\nMissouri river. J. W. B. Kelley, a rabid anti-slavery lawyer, from\r\nCincinnati, who became a resident of Atchison, expressed the opinion\r\nthat if Thomassen’s negro woman had been treated better by her master\r\nshe would not have committed suicide by jumping into the river.\r\nThomassen was greatly angered at this personal illusion and deluded\r\nhimself into believing that if he satisfied his own vengeance he would\r\nat the same time be rendering the pro-slavery party a service. He\r\ntherefore picked a quarrel with Kelley and they came to blows, after\r\nwhich Thomassen’s conduct was sustained by a largo meeting of Atchison\r\npeople. While it is said that Thomassen was a larger and more powerful\r\nman than Kelley, the people did not consider this fact, but rather\r\nconsidered the principle involved, and as a result they commended the\r\nact in the following resolution:\r\n\r\n“1. Resolved. That one J. W. B. Kelley, hailing from Cincinnati, having\r\nupon sundry occasions denounced our institutions and declared all pro-\r\nslavery men ruffians, we deem it an act of kindness and hereby command\r\nhim to leave the town of Atchison one hour after being informed of the\r\npassage of this resolution never more to show himself in this vicinity.\r\n\r\n2. Resolved. That in case he fails to obey this reasonable command, we\r\ninflict upon him such punishment as the nature of the case may require.\r\n\r\n3. Resolved. That other emissaries of this ‘Aid Society’ now in our\r\nmidst, tampering with our slaves, are warned to leave, else they too\r\nwill meet the reward which their nefarious designs so justly merit.—\r\nHemp.\r\n\r\n4. Resolved. That we approve and applaud our fellow-townsman, Grafton\r\nThomassen, for the castigation administered to said J. W. B. Kelley,\r\nwhose presence among us is a libel upon our good standing and a disgrace\r\nto our community.\r\n\r\n5. Resolved. That we commend the good work of purging our town of all\r\nresident abolitionists, and after cleaning our town of such nuisances\r\nshall do the same for the settlers on Walnut and Independence creeks\r\nwhose propensities for cattle stealing are well known to many.\r\n\r\n6. Resolved. That the chairman appoint a committee of three to wait upon\r\nsaid Kelley and acquaint him with the actions of this meeting.\r\n\r\n7. Resolved. That the proceedings of this meeting be published, that the\r\nworld may know our determination.”\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of these resolutions they were circulated throughout\r\nAtchison and all citizens were asked to sign the same and if any person\r\nrefused he was deemed and treated as an abolitionist. A few days after\r\nthis incident Rev. Pardee Butler, a minister of the Christian church,\r\nwho was living at that time near the now abandoned townsite of Pardee,\r\nwest of Atchison, about twelve miles, came to town to do some trading.\r\nButler was an uncompromising anti-slavery advocate and never overlooked\r\nan opportunity to make his sentiments known. He had strong convictions\r\nbacked by courage, and while he did not seek controversies, he never\r\nshowed a desire to avoid them. He was well known in the community as a\r\nFree State man, and so when he came into Atchison after these\r\nresolutions were passed and the town was all excited about them it did\r\nnot take him long to get into the controversy and he condemned in strong\r\nterms the outrage upon Kelley and also the resolutions which were\r\npassed. In the course of a conversation which he had at the postoffice\r\nwith Robert S. Kelley, the postmaster and assistant editor of the\r\n_Squatter Sovereign_, he informed Mr. Kelley that he long since would\r\nhave become a subscriber to his paper had he not disliked the violent\r\nsentiments which appeared in its columns. Mr. Kelley replied: “I look\r\nupon all Free Soilers as rogues and they ought to be treated as such.”\r\nMr. Butler responded: “I am a Free Soiler and expect to vote for Kansas\r\nas a Free State.” “I do not expect you will be allowed to vote,” was Mr.\r\nKelley’s reply. On the following morning Mr. Kelley called at the\r\nNational hotel, corner of Second and Atchison streets, where Mr. Butler\r\nhad spent the night, accompanied by a number of friends and demanded\r\nButler to sign the resolutions, which of course Mr. Butler refused to\r\ndo, and walked down stairs into the street. A crowd gathered and seized\r\nMr. Butler, dragging him towards the river, shouting that they intended\r\nto drown him. The mob increased in size as they proceeded with the\r\nvictim. A vote was taken as to the kind of punishment which ought to be\r\ngiven him and a verdict of death by hanging was rendered. It was not\r\ndiscovered until forty years afterwards that Mr. Kelley, the teller,\r\nsaved Mr. Butler’s life by making false returns to the excited mob. Mr.\r\nKelley subsequently was a resident of Montana and gave this information\r\nwhile stopping in St. Joseph with Dr. J. H. Stringfellow, the former\r\neditor of the _Squatter Sovereign_. Instead of returning a verdict of\r\ndeath by hanging Mr. Kelley announced that it was the decision of the\r\nmob to send Mr. Butler down the Missouri river on a raft, and an account\r\nof what followed is best given by Rev. Pardee Butler himself:\r\n\r\n“When we arrived at the bank Mr. Kelley painted my face with black\r\npaint, marked upon it the letter “R.” The company had increased to some\r\nthirty or forty persons. Without any trial, witness, judge, counsel or\r\njury, for about two hours I was a sort of target at which were hurled\r\nimprecations, curses, arguments, entreaties, accusations and\r\ninterrogations. They constructed a raft of three cottonwood sawlogs,\r\nfastened together with inch plank nailed to the logs, upon which they\r\nput me and sent me down the Missouri river. The raft was towed out to\r\nthe middle of the stream with a canoe. Robert S. Kelley held the rope\r\nthat towed the raft. They gave me neither rudder, oar nor anything else\r\nto manage my raft with. They put up a flag on the raft with the\r\nfollowing inscription on it:\r\n\r\n  ‘Eastern Emigrant Aid Express.\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Pardee Butler again for the underground road;\r\n\r\n  The way they are served in Kansas: Shipped for Boston; Cargo insured.\r\n      Unavoidable danger of the Missourians and Missouri river excepted.\r\n\r\n  Let future emissaries from the north Beware.\r\n\r\n  Our Hemp crop is sufficient to reward all such scoundrels.’\r\n\r\n“They threatened to shoot me if I pulled the flag down. I pulled it\r\ndown, cut the flag off the flag staff, made a paddle out of the flag\r\nstaff and ultimately got ashore about six miles below.”\r\n\r\nThe mob was considerate enough to provide Mr. Butler a loaf of bread and\r\npermitted him to take his baggage on board, afterwards escorting him\r\ndown the river for some distance.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Butler landed he returned overland to his home near Pardee. On\r\nApril 30, 1856, he again ventured to make his appearance in Atchison,\r\nwhere he says: “I spoke to no one in town save two merchants of the\r\nplace with whom I had business transactions since my first arrival in\r\nthe territory. Having remained only a few minutes I went to my buggy to\r\nresume my journey when I was assaulted by Robert S. Kelley, junior\r\neditor of the _Squatter Sovereign_; was dragged into a grocery and there\r\nsurrounded by a company of South Carolinians who are reported to have\r\nbeen sent out by a Southern Emigrant Aid Society. After exposing me to\r\nevery sort of indignity they stripped me to the waist, covered my body\r\nwith tar and then for the want of feathers applied cotton wool, having\r\nappointed a committee of three to certainly hang me the next time I\r\nshould come to Atchison. They tossed my clothes into the buggy, put me\r\ntherein, accompanying me to the suburbs of the town and sent me naked\r\nupon the prairie. I adjusted my attire about me as best I could and\r\nhastened to rejoin my wife and two little sons on the banks of Stranger\r\ncreek. It was rather a sorrowful meeting after so long a parting.”\r\n\r\nThe above incident gives some idea of the prevailing sentiment in\r\nAtchison county during the period beginning in 1854 and ending in 1857.\r\n\r\nThere was little chance of Free State settlers to avoid trouble except\r\nby discreet silence. It would not be just, however, to fail to disclose\r\nthe fact that the Free State men also had their secret organizations.\r\nThe Kansas Legion was a military organization for defensive purposes\r\nonly. Its members were organized into companies, battalions and\r\nregiments and were officered and armed with rifles and pistols sent from\r\nthe East. These organizations were the natural result of the secret pro-\r\nslavery organizations of Missouri and were known to exist to protect the\r\nFree State settlers against the attacks of the Blue Lodges, Sons of the\r\nSouth, and the Social Bands.\r\n\r\nA man by the name of Pat Laughlin became a member of the Kansas Legion\r\nand was very active in organizing companies of that organization at\r\ndifferent points in the territory. He subsequently became a traitor to\r\nhis associates and gave out information to the enemy, thereby creating\r\ngreat indignation among his former friends whom he had betrayed. Later\r\nLaughlin and Samuel Collins, of Doniphan county, became engaged in a\r\nfierce altercation and friends of both parties to the dispute were\r\npresent and armed. Laughlin shot Collins and killed him on the spot and\r\nwas slightly wounded himself. This affair occurred October 25, 1855. No\r\nattempt was made by the appointed peace officers of the territory to\r\nbring the guilty parties participating in the Pardee Butler outrage or\r\nthe murder of Collins to justice. Shortly after Laughlin recovered from\r\nhis wound he secured a position in a store in Atchison and lived there\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\nThis condition of affairs could not long exist without an open rupture\r\nbetween the two opposing forces and from this time on there was a\r\nsuccession of personal encounters of wide significance, and in addition\r\nthere was the war along the border in which Atchison county played a\r\nconspicuous but not a glorious part. The activities here at that crucial\r\nperiod were largely in the interest of the pro-slavery forces. It was at\r\nthis juncture that the immortal John Brown appeared on the scene to\r\nbegin his work of driving the slavery advocates from Kansas and making\r\nit and the Nation free. His first appearance among the Free State men\r\nwas December 7, 1855, but he had been in the territory several months\r\nbefore that with his four sons. John Brown did not reach Atchison county\r\nduring his stormy career in Kansas. The nearest he ever came was in 1857\r\nwhen he passed through Jackson county with a party of slaves which he\r\nwas taking from Missouri to Nebraska for the purpose of setting them\r\nfree. In the historical edition of the Atchison _Daily Globe_ of July\r\n16, 1894, there appears the following short reference to this excursion:\r\n\r\n“In 1857 John Brown made a trip from Missouri into Nebraska with a party\r\nof slave negroes which he intended to set free. His route was through\r\nJackson county, Kansas, and up by where the town of Centralia now\r\nstands. A lot of the pro-slavery enthusiasts in Atchison heard of the\r\naffair and went out to intercept Brown. They came up with him near\r\nCentralia, but Brown had heard of their coming and captured the entire\r\nparty. One of the men in the pro-slavery party was named George Ringo;\r\nafterwards he soldiered with Dwight Merlin in the Thirteenth Kansas and\r\noften talked of the trip to Merwin around their camp fires. Ringo says\r\nthat James T. Herford was another member of the pro-slavery party, and a\r\nman named Cook was another. John Brown looked at Cook critically after\r\nthe capture and asked his name. Cook said his name was Thomas Porter. “I\r\nbelieve you are lying. I believe your name is Cook and if I was certain\r\nof it I would kill you,” Brown said. Cook was one of the men accused of\r\nkilling Brown’s son at Osawatomie, but Brown was not certain of his\r\nidentity and let him go with the others. George Ringo says that Brown\r\nheld a prayer meeting in his camp every evening and asked a blessing at\r\nevery meal.\r\n\r\n“One night when the Atchison party was in the custody of Brown, Brown\r\nasked Jim Herford to pray. ‘I can’t pray,’ Herford replied. ‘Didn’t your\r\nmother teach you to pray?’ Brown inquired. ‘She taught me to say, “Now I\r\nlay me down to sleep,” that was all,’ Herford answered. ‘All right,’\r\nBrown said, ‘get down on your knees and say, “Now I lay me down to\r\nsleep.”’ Herford did as he was requested, being afraid to refuse and\r\nBrown soon rolled himself in a blanket and went to sleep.”\r\n\r\nAs the activities of Brown increased so likewise the activities of the\r\npro-slavery forces increased under the leadership of Senator Atchison,\r\nof Missouri, and Dr. Stringfellow, editor of the _Squatter Sovereign_.\r\nThe _Squatter Sovereign_, about which more will appear in a subsequent\r\nchapter, was published in Atchison and was largely supported by\r\ngovernment advertising patronage. It was the leading pro-slavery\r\nnewspaper organ of the territory. Senator Atchison’s activities were of\r\nthe most pronounced sort. He not only urged his Missouri constituents to\r\ninvade the territory in all their might and capture the Yankees, but he\r\nwent himself. At Platte City, Mo., February 4, 1856, Senator Atchison\r\nmade a speech which gives some idea of the language he employed in\r\nurging the people of western Missouri to join in the invading of Kansas.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n“I was a prominent agent in repealing the Missouri Compromise and\r\nopening the territory for settlement. The abolition traitors drummed up\r\ntheir forces and whistled them onto the cars, and whistled them off\r\nagain at Kansas City: some of them had ‘Kansas and Liberty’ on their\r\nhats. I saw this with my own eyes. These men came with the avowed\r\npurpose of driving or expelling you from the territory. What did I\r\nadvise you to do? Why, to beat them at their own game. When the first\r\nelection came off I told you to go over and vote. You did so and beat\r\nthem. Well, what next? Why, an election of members of the legislature to\r\norganize the territory must be held. What did I advise you to do then?\r\nWhy, meet them on their own ground and at their own game again: and,\r\ncold and inclement as the weather was, I went over with a company of\r\nmen. The abolitionists of the North said, and published it abroad, that\r\nAtchison was there with bowie-knives, and by God, it was true. I never\r\ndid go into that territory—I never intend to go into that territory—\r\nwithout being prepared for all such kinds of cattle.\r\n\r\n“They held an election on the fifteenth of last month and they intend to\r\nput the machinery of the State in motion on the fourth of March. Now you\r\nare entitled to my advice, and you shall have it. I say, _prepare\r\nyourselves. Go over there._ Send your young men, and if they attempt to\r\ndrive you out, then, damn them, drive _them_ out. Fifty of you with your\r\nshotguns are worth 250 of them with their Sharpe’s rifles. Get ready—arm\r\nyourselves; for, if they abolitionize Kansas you lose one million\r\ndollars of your property. I am satisfied that I can justify every act of\r\nyou before God and a jury.”\r\n\r\nAll of the pro-slavery papers were open in their advocacy of an\r\nimmediate war of extermination. The _Squatter Sovereign_ in its issue\r\njust after the election of January 15, commenting on certain\r\ndisturbances at Easton and a murder at Leavenworth, did not condemn what\r\ntook place at Easton and had no word of apology or pity to offer for the\r\nmurdered man. On the contrary it upheld those who committed the murder\r\nand gave them encouragement in their campaign of killing abolitionists.\r\nDr. Stringfellow employed his violent rhetoric to give vent to his\r\nfeelings and the opening paragraph of his leading editorial in the issue\r\nof the _Squatter Sovereign_ he used the following language:\r\n\r\n“It seems now to be certain that we will have to give the abolitionists\r\nat least one good thrashing before political matters are settled in this\r\nterritory. To do so we must have arms; we have the men. I propose to\r\nraise funds to furnish Colt’s revolvers for those who are without them.\r\nWe say if the abolitionists are able to whip us and overturn the\r\ngovernment that has been set up here, the sooner it is known the better,\r\nand we want to see it settled.”\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the following winter preparations for attack and\r\ndefense went quietly on. There was drilling along the border and\r\ndisquieting rumors came from time to time of companies that had been\r\norganized and equipped to move into Kansas as soon as spring opened to\r\nuphold the rights of the Southerners.\r\n\r\nAtchison county took a prominent part in the border warfare. The bold\r\nattitude assumed by the Free State forces in and around Lawrence; the\r\nWakarusa war; the Free State elections, and the determination of the\r\nFree State party to convene their legislature in March, 1856, kept the\r\npartisan pro-slavery sentiment in Atchison in a constant tumult. In\r\nMarch large numbers of South Carolina emigrants, armed and equipped with\r\nthe avowed purpose of enforcing southern rights in Kansas, arrived on\r\nall the incoming steamboats. Capt. F. G. Palmer, of Atchison, commanded\r\none of the earliest if not the earliest company of these emigrants.\r\nRobert De Treville was first lieutenant. The home company had been\r\nformed prior to the arrival of the South Carolinians. Dr. John H.\r\nStringfellow was captain; Robert S. Kelley, first lieutenant; A. J. G.\r\nWestbrook, second lieutenant, and John H. Blassingame, third lieutenant.\r\nTheir arms were supplied from Ft. Leavenworth and by the last of April\r\nthey were ready and waiting for the assault and the subsequent “sacking”\r\nof Lawrence. The whole countryside was aflame with the passion of war.\r\nBy May 1 quite a large army of pro-slavery sympathizers was organized.\r\nThe South Carolinian Company, from Atchison, was among the first to\r\nstart the assault upon Lawrence and it was not long before “its flag was\r\nplanted upon the rifle pit of the enemy.” Dr. Stringfellow was there and\r\nRobert S. Kelley, his able assistant on the _Squatter Sovereign_, was\r\nalso there. In an account of the assault the following appeared in the\r\n_Squatter Sovereign_.\r\n\r\n“The flag was carried by its brave bearer and stationed upon the Herald\r\nof Freedom Printing office, and from thence to the large hotel and\r\nfortress of the Yankees, where it proudly waived until the artillery\r\ncommenced battering down the building. Our company was composed mostly\r\nof South Carolinians, under command of Capt. Robert De Treville, late of\r\nCharleston, S. C. and we venture the prediction that a braver set of men\r\nthan are found in its ranks never bore arms.”\r\n\r\nThe _Squatter Sovereign_ continued to be without fear the most bitter\r\nand uncompromising pro-slavery organ in the territory. Its watch-word\r\nwas “Death to all Yankees and traitors in Kansas.” At a large mass\r\nmeeting at Atchison, held in June, 1856, Robert S. Kelley, its assistant\r\neditor, was nominated as the “Commander-in-Chief of the forces in town,”\r\nbut for some reason now lost to view Kelley declined the honor and it\r\nwas passed on to Capt. F. G. Palmer who accepted it without remorse and\r\nwithout apologies. Senator Atchison was present at this mass meeting and\r\nmade a speech, and so was Col. Peter T. Abell, afterwards president of\r\nthe Atchison Town Company, and Captain De Treville, and others not so\r\nfamous, and they all made speeches.\r\n\r\nDuring that summer, because of the continued activities of old John\r\nBrown and the agitation which those activities created in the breasts of\r\nthe pro-slavery sympathizers in Atchison, another military company was\r\nformed, called the Atchison Guards, of which John Robertson was the\r\ncommander, who was so prominent in the Battle of Hickory Point, and\r\nAtchison county continued to take a prominent part in the border warfare\r\nwhich continued for sometime thereafter. During all of this time the\r\nFree State settlers of Atchison were very quiet and undemonstrative.\r\nThey were not strong in number and aside from a few virile souls like\r\nPardee Butler, they held their tongues and kept their own counsel. They\r\nwere treated with scant courtesy and consideration by their pro-slavery\r\nneighbors, and it can be said to their credit that no set of men ever\r\ndisplayed greater self-restraint or suffered more for the cause of peace\r\nthan the Free State settlers of this county. It doubtless unsettled\r\ntheir minds and disturbed their slumbers to read from time to time\r\nsentiments such as these taken from the _Squatter Sovereign_ of June 10,\r\n1856:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  (Upper) Atchison Hospital. (Center) Atchison County Court House.\r\n    (Lower) Y. M. C. A.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Hundreds of Free State men who have committed no overt act, but have\r\nonly given countenance to those reckless murderers, assassins and\r\nthieves, will, of necessity, share the same fate of their brethren. If\r\nCivil war is to be the result of such a conflict, there cannot be, and\r\nwill not be any neutrals recognized. ‘He that is not for us is against\r\nus,’ will of necessity be the motto, and those who are not willing to\r\ntake either one side or the other are the most unfortunate men in Kansas\r\nand had better flee to other regions as expeditiously as possible. They\r\nare not the men for Kansas.”\r\n\r\nIn another issue Dr. Stringfellow said:\r\n\r\n“The abolitionists shoot down our men without provocation wherever they\r\nmeet them. Let us retaliate in the same manner. A free fight is all we\r\ndesire. If murder and assassination is the program of the day we are in\r\nfavor of filling the bill. Let not the knives of the pro-slavery men be\r\nsheathed while there is one abolitionist in the territory. As they have\r\nshown no quarters to our men they deserve none from us. Let our motto be\r\nwritten in blood upon our flags. ‘_Death to all Yankees and Traitors in\r\nKansas._’ We have 150 men in Atchison ready to start in an hour’s\r\nnotice. All we lack is horses and provisions.”\r\n\r\nAnd then follows an exhortation from Dr. Stringfellow to his friends in\r\nMissouri to contribute something that will enable his constituents to\r\nprotect their lives and their families from the outrages of the\r\nassassins of the North, and ends by stating that the war will not cease\r\nuntil Kansas has been purged of abolitionists.\r\n\r\nPro-slavery committees from Doniphan, Atchison and Leavenworth counties\r\nwere organized to call on their friends in the South for arms,\r\nammunition and provisions, and a circular letter appeared in the\r\n_Leavenworth Herald_, and an urgent invitation was issued to all the\r\npro-slavery papers to give the circular wide publicity. It read, in\r\npart, as follows:\r\n\r\n“To our friends throughout the United States:\r\n\r\n“The undersigned, having been appointed a committee by our fellow\r\ncitizens of the counties of Leavenworth, Doniphan and Atchison, in\r\nKansas Territory, to consult together and to adopt measures for mutual\r\nprotection and the advancement of the interests of the pro-slavery party\r\nin Kansas Territory, this day assembled at the town of Atchison, to\r\nundertake the responsible duty assigned us; and in our present emergency\r\ndeem it expedient to address this circular to our friends throughout the\r\nunion, but more particularly in the slave-holding states. * * * * The\r\ntime has arrived when prompt action is required and the interior of\r\nKansas can easily be supplied from various points in the above named\r\ncounties. The pro-slavery party is the only one in Kansas which pretends\r\nto uphold the Government or abide by the laws. Our party from the\r\nbeginning has sought to make Kansas a slave state, only by legal means.\r\nWe have been slandered and vilified almost beyond endurance, yet we have\r\nnot resorted to violence, but steadily pursued the law for the\r\naccomplishment of our objects. * * * * We have proclaimed to the world\r\nthat we recognize the principle of the Kansas Bill as just and right,\r\nand although we preferred Kansas being made a negro slave state, yet we\r\nnever dreamed of making it so by the aid of bowie-knives, revolvers and\r\nSharpe rifles, until we were threatened to be driven out of the\r\nterritory by a band of hired abolitionists, brought up and sent here to\r\ncontrol our elections and steal our slaves. We are still ready and\r\nintend to continue so, if our friends abroad stand by and assist us. Our\r\npeople are poor and their labor is their capital. Deprive them of that,\r\nwhich we are now compelled to do, and they must be supported from\r\nabroad, or give up the cause of the South. The Northern Abolitionists\r\ncan raise millions of dollars, and station armed bands of fanatics\r\nthroughout the territory and support them, in order to deprive Southern\r\nmen of their constitutional rights. We address this to our friends only,\r\nfor the purpose of letting them know our true condition and our wants.\r\nWe know that our call will meet a ready, willing and liberal response.\r\n* * * * Heaven and earth is being moved in all the free states to induce\r\noverwhelming armies to march here to drive us from the land. We are able\r\nto take care of those already here, but let our brethren in the states\r\ntake care of the outsiders. Watch them, and if our enemies march for\r\nKansas let our friends come along to take care of them, and if nothing\r\nbut a fight can bring about peace, let us have a fight that will amount\r\nto something. Send us the money and other articles mentioned as soon as\r\npracticable, and if the abolitionists find it convenient to _bring_\r\ntheir supplies, let our friends _come_ with ours. Arrangements have been\r\nmade with Messrs. Majors, Russell & Company, Leavenworth, K. T.; J. W.\r\nForeman & Company, Doniphan, K. T., and C. E. Woolfolk & Company,\r\nAtchison, K. T., to receive any money or other articles sent for our\r\nrelief, and will report to the undersigned, and we pledge ourselves that\r\nall will be distributed for the benefit of the cause. Horses, we greatly\r\nneed—footmen being useless in running down midnight assassins and\r\nrobbers.”\r\n\r\nThe following residents of Atchison county signed the circular: P. T.\r\nAbell, chairman; J. A. Headley, A. J. Frederick, J. F. Green, Jr., C. E.\r\nMason.\r\n\r\nThis circular was signed June 6, 1856, and was published in the\r\n_Lawrence Herald of Freedom_, June 14, 1856.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the conflagration spread with ever increasing\r\nfury, and not only did the appeals for aid from the pro-slavery forces\r\nfind immediate response, but likewise the anti-slavery forces throughout\r\nthe whole North came to the rescue of the Free Soilers in Kansas, and\r\nduring all of this great excitement Atchison county was the focal point\r\nof pro-slavery activities. The news of the “sacking” of Lawrence served\r\nto awaken the Nation in the North. It was at this time that Henry Ward\r\nBeecher, with all of the great eloquence at his command, advocated from\r\nhis Brooklyn pulpit the sending of Sharpe rifles instead of Bibles to\r\nKansas, and pledged his own parish to supply a definite number. And on\r\nand on they came to Kansas out of the North with determination in their\r\nhearts and Sharpe rifles in their hands, to help the Free Soilers in\r\ntheir battles against the forces of Atchison and Stringfellow and Abell.\r\nThen came Lane’s “Army of the North,” which sounded more terrible than\r\nit really was, following in quick succession the second battle of\r\nFranklin; the siege and capitulation of Ft. Titus, and the famous battle\r\nof Osawatomie. At last the mobilization of the forces of Atchison and\r\nStringfellow not far from the outskirts at Lawrence in September, 1856,\r\nfor the purpose of a final assault on that Free State stronghold, marked\r\nthe collapse of the Atchison-Stringfellow military campaign. It was a\r\ncritical hour for Lane. Old John Brown was there, and the citizens were\r\nready for whatever might befall them, but further hostilities were\r\naverted by the action of Governor Geary on the morning of September 15,\r\n1856, when he appeared in person in the midst of the Missouri camp\r\nseveral hours after issuing a proclamation for the Missourians to\r\ndisband. He found both Senator Atchison and Gen. B. F. Stringfellow\r\n(brother of Dr. Stringfellow) there, and in the course of his speech\r\nseverely reprimanded Atchison, who “from his high estate as Vice-\r\nPresident of the United States, had fallen so low as to be the leader of\r\nan army of men with uncontrollable passions, determined upon wholesale\r\nslaughter and destruction.”\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Geary had concluded his remarks his proclamation and order\r\nto disband the army were read and the more judicious obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe troops thus disbanded, marched homeward. Those enlisting at Atchison\r\nreturned to Missouri by way of Lecompton. This was the last organized\r\nmilitary invasion from Missouri and ended the attempts of the pro-\r\nslavery forces to rule Kansas by martial law.\r\n\r\nIt must not be concluded, however, that the Stringfellows and other pro-\r\nslavery leaders in Atchison county were not law-abiding citizens. They\r\nbelieved in the institution of slavery, as many good men of that day\r\ndid, and they had the same rights to peacefully enter the territory of\r\nKansas and endeavor to make it a slave State under the principle of\r\nSquatter sovereignty, as Dr. Charles Robinson, and Lane, and John Brown\r\ndid to make the territory a free State. It would not only be unjust to\r\nthe memory of the Stringfellows and their compatriots, but unjust to\r\nposterity also to leave the impression that they had no semblance of\r\njustification, for many of their acts, which the impartial historian\r\nwill admit, were very frequently in retaliation of wrongs and outrages\r\nsuffered. The terrible stress and strain under which good men on both\r\nsides labored in those critical days led them to extremes, and in the\r\nmidst of the discordant passions of good men, the bad men—those who are\r\nthe lawless of every age and clime—flourished and their lawlessness only\r\nserved to complicate the dangerous and ever threatening situation. Calm\r\njudgment may not have been lacking in the territory in and around\r\nAtchison and Lawrence in the days between 1854 and 1857, but if it\r\nexisted at all it was lost in the riot of partisan feeling and did not\r\nevince itself until later.\r\n\r\nFollowing the disbanding of the “Territorial” militia before Lawrence,\r\nGeneral Atchison seemed to have somewhat recovered his composure and in\r\nan address to the troops after Governor Geary had retired, he said:\r\n\r\n“As was well known to all present the gentlemen composing this meeting\r\nhad just been in conference with Governor Geary, who in the strongest\r\nlanguage had deprecated the inhuman outrages perpetrated by those whom\r\nhe characterized as bandits, now roving through the territory, and\r\npledged himself in the most solemn manner to employ actively all of the\r\nforce at his command in executing the laws of the territory and giving\r\nprotection to his beloved citizens, and who had also appealed to us to\r\ndissolve our present organization and stand by and co-operate with him\r\nin holding up the hands of his power against all evil doers, and who had\r\nalso retired from the meeting, with a request that he would consult and\r\ndetermine what course would be taken. Now the object of the meeting was\r\nthus to consult and determine what should be done.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Atchison also impressed the meeting with the solemnity and\r\nimportance of the occasion and said that it was time for men to exercise\r\ntheir reason and not yield to their passions and also to keep on the\r\nside of the law which alone constitutes our strength and protection.\r\nThese words of General Atchison breathed a far different message than\r\nhis strong language of a few years before and indicated more plainly\r\nthan anything else the general trend of pro-slavery sentiment.\r\n\r\nAfter the cessation of military movements in the territory, more or less\r\npeaceful elections, sessions of the legislature and conventions, at\r\nwhich constitutions were framed and voted upon, took place, and the work\r\nof preparing the territory to become a State went forward.\r\n\r\nFour constitutions were framed before Kansas was admitted to the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Topeka constitution, which was the first in order, was adopted by\r\nthe convention which framed it November 11, 1855, and by the people of\r\nthe territory at an election December 15, 1855.\r\n\r\nThe Lecompton constitution was adopted by the convention which framed it\r\nNovember 7, 1857, and was submitted to a vote of the people December 21,\r\n1857, and the form of the vote prescribed was: “For the constitution,\r\nwith slavery,” and “For the constitution, without slavery.” As no\r\nopportunity was afforded at this election to vote against the\r\nconstitution the Free State people did not participate in it. The\r\nTerritorial legislature was summoned in extra session and passed it\r\nwithout submitting this constitution to a vote of the people, January 4,\r\n1858, and at that election 138 votes were cast for it and 10,226 against\r\nit. In spite of this overwhelming vote against the constitution it was\r\nsent to Washington and was transmitted by President Buchanan to the\r\nSenate who urged the admission of Kansas under it, thus starting the\r\ngreat contest which divided the Democratic party, the election of\r\nAbraham Lincoln as President, and the final overthrow of the slave\r\nparty. The bill to admit Kansas under this constitution failed, but a\r\nbill finally passed Congress, under the provisions of which the\r\nconstitution was again submitted to the people August 4, 1858, with the\r\nresult that there were 1,788 votes cast for it and 11,300 votes cast\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nThe convention which framed the Leavenworth constitution was provided\r\nfor by an act of the Territorial legislature, passed in February, 1858,\r\nat which time the Lecompton constitution was pending in Congress. The\r\nLeavenworth constitution was adopted by the convention April 3, 1858,\r\nand by the people May 18, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe Wyandotte constitution was adopted by the convention which framed it\r\nJuly 29, 1859, and adopted by the people October 4, 1859. It was under\r\nthe Wyandotte constitution that the State was admitted into the Union\r\nJanuary 29, 1861.\r\n\r\nIn this last convention Atchison county played a very important part.\r\nThree members were sent from this county: Caleb May, to whom reference\r\nhas been made before, a farmer, born in Kentucky, and residing near the\r\nnow abandoned townsite of Pardee; John J. Ingalls, a lawyer at Sumner,\r\nwho arrived in Kansas from Massachusetts, October 4, 1858, exactly one\r\nyear previous to the adoption of the constitution by the people of the\r\nTerritory, and Robert Graham, a merchant at Atchison, who was born in\r\nIreland. John A. Martin, the editor of _Freedom’s Champion_, the\r\nsuccessor to the _Squatter Sovereign_, at Atchison, was secretary of the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nCaleb May remained a successful farmer and leading citizen of the county\r\nfor many years after this convention, subsequently drifting to the\r\nIndian Territory, where he died.\r\n\r\nJohn J. Ingalls became United States senator from Kansas, where he\r\nremained for eighteen years, part of the time as president protempore of\r\nthat body.\r\n\r\nJohn A. Martin became one of the leading military heroes of Kansas, and\r\nserved as governor of the State from 1886 to 1888. He played an\r\nimportant part as an officer of the convention, as also did Mr. Ingalls,\r\nwho, Samuel A. Stinson says, was the “recognized scholar of the\r\nconvention, and authority on all questions connected with the\r\narrangement and phraseology of the instrument.” For this reason he was\r\nmade chairman of the committee on phraseology and arrangements. Robert\r\nGraham was chairman of the committee on corporations and banking, and on\r\nthe ballot to locate a temporary capital of the State Atchison received\r\nsix votes. Topeka received twenty-nine and was chosen as the temporary\r\ncapital and afterwards became the permanent capital of Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n              ORGANIZATION OF COUNTY AND CITY OF ATCHISON.\r\n\r\n  ONE OF THE THIRTY-THREE ORIGINAL COUNTIES—THE CITY OF ATCHISON\r\n      LOCATED—TOWN COMPANY—SALE OF LOTS—INCORPORATION OF TOWN—EARLY\r\n      BUSINESS ENTERPRISES—ORGANIZATION OF COUNTY—COMMERCIAL GROWTH—\r\n      FREIGHTING—FIRST OFFICERS—FREE STATE AND PRO-SLAVERY CLASHES—\r\n      HORACE GREELEY VISITS ATCHISON—ABRAHAM LINCOLN MAKES A SPEECH\r\n      HERE—GREAT DROUGHT OF 1860—CITY OFFICIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtchison was one of the thirty-three original counties created by the\r\nfirst territorial legislature, which convened at Pawnee, July 2, 1855,\r\nand subsequently adjourned to Shawnee Mission, July 6, 1855, and was\r\nnamed for Senator David R. Atchison, United States senator from\r\nMissouri, concerning whom much has been said in previous chapters. The\r\ncounty was surveyed in 1855 and divided into three townships,\r\nGrasshopper township comprising all that section lying west of the old\r\nPottawatomie road; Mount Pleasant township, all east of the old\r\nPottawatomie road, and south of Walnut creek, from its confluence with\r\nthe Missouri river to the source of the creek and a parallel line west\r\nto the old Pottawatomie road, and Shannon township, all that section of\r\nthe county north of Mount Pleasant township. Subsequently, this sub-\r\ndivision was further divided into eight townships, now comprising the\r\ncounty, to-wit: Grasshopper, Mount Pleasant, Shannon, Lancaster,\r\nKapioma, Center, Walnut and Benton. The county is located in the extreme\r\nnortheastern part of Kansas, save one, Doniphan county, by which it is\r\nbounded on the north, together with Brown county, and on the west by\r\nJackson county, and on the south by Jefferson and Leavenworth counties.\r\nIt has an area of 409 square miles, or 271,360 acres.\r\n\r\nThe site of the city of Atchison, the first town in the county, was\r\nselected because of its conspicuous geographical location on the river.\r\nSenator Atchison and his associates attached great importance to the\r\nfact that the river bent boldly inland at this point. They felt that it\r\nwould be of great commercial advantage to a town to be thus located, so\r\nJuly 4, 1854, after a careful consideration of the matter, in all of its\r\nphases, Senator Atchison and his Platte county, Missouri, friends\r\ndedicated the new town. They felt that they had located the natural\r\ngateway through which all the overland traffic to Utah, Oregon and\r\nCalifornia would pass. After they had settled with George Million, the\r\nfirst known white settler of the territory, and attended to other\r\nunimportant preliminaries Dr. J. H. Stringfellow made a claim just north\r\nof the Million claim, and with Ira Norris, James T. Darnell, Leonidas\r\nOldham, James B. Martin, George Million and Samuel Dickson, agreed to\r\nform a town company, and they received into their organization David R.\r\nAtchison, Elijah Green, E. H. Norton, Peter T. Abell, B. F.\r\nStringfellow, Lewis Burnes, Daniel D. Burnes, James N. Burnes, Calvin F.\r\nBurnes and Stephen Johnson. A week later these men gathered under a\r\nlarge cottonwood tree, near Atchison street, on the river, and organized\r\nby electing Peter T. Abell, president; Dr. J. H. Stringfellow,\r\nsecretary, and Col. James N. Burnes, treasurer. Peter T. Abell,\r\npresident of the town company, was an able lawyer, and a Southern man,\r\nwith pronounced views on the question of slavery. But he was a man of\r\njudgment, and a natural boomer. He was a very large man, being over six\r\nfeet tall and weighed almost 300 pounds. When he became president of the\r\ntown company he was a resident of Weston, Mo., and lived there until a\r\nyear after Atchison had been surveyed. Subsequently, Senator Atchison\r\nassigned his interests in the town company to his nephew, James Headley,\r\nwho afterwards became one of the leading lawyers of the town. Jesse\r\nMorris also became a member.\r\n\r\nThe town company, having been regularly organized, the townsite was\r\ndivided into 100 shares. Each of its members retained five shares; the\r\nbalance of thirty being held for general distribution. Abell, B. F.\r\nStringfellow and all of the Burnes brothers were received as two\r\nparties. Henry Kuhn, a surveyor, surveyed 480 acres, which comprised the\r\noriginal townsite. Mr. Kuhn and his son returned to Atchison forty-five\r\nyears later, and for a short time ran the _Atchison Champion_. On\r\nSeptember 21, the first sale of town lots was held, amidst great\r\nexcitement and general interest. It was a gathering which had both\r\npolitical and business significance. Senator Atchison, from Missouri,\r\nwith a large number of his constituents, was there, and Atchison made a\r\nspeech, in which one reporter quotes him as having said:\r\n\r\n“People of every quarter should be welcome to the Territory, and treated\r\nwith civility as long as they showed themselves peaceable men.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A View in Commercial Street. Looking East, Atchison, Kansas\r\n]\r\n\r\nSomeone in the crowd called out, “What shall we do with those who run\r\noff with our negroes?” “Hang ’em,” cried a voice in the crowd. To this\r\nMr. Atchison replied, “No, I would not hang them, but I would get them\r\nout of the Territory, get rid of them.” One version of the speech was to\r\nthe effect that Senator Atchison answered his questioners by saying, “By\r\nG—d, sir, hang every abolitionist you find in the Territory.” But the\r\nbest account of the meeting was printed in a Parkville, Mo., newspaper,\r\nand was reported by an eye witness, who said:\r\n\r\n“We arrived at Atchison in the forenoon. Among the company was our\r\ndistinguished senator, in honor of whom the new city was named. There\r\nwas a large assemblage on the ground, with plenty of tables set for\r\ndinner, where the crowd could be accommodated with bacon and bread, and\r\na drink at the branch, at fifty cents a head. The survey of the town had\r\njust been completed the evening before. Stockholders held a meeting, to\r\narrange particulars of sale, and afterwards, as had been previously\r\nannounced, General Atchison mounted an old wagon and made a speech. He\r\ncommenced by mentioning the bountiful country that was beginning to be\r\nsettled; to some of the circumstances under which a territorial\r\ngovernment was organized, and in the course of his remarks, mentioned\r\nhow Douglass came to introduce the Nebraska bill, with a repeal clause\r\nin it. He told of how Judge Douglass requested twenty-four hours in\r\nwhich to consider the question of introducing a bill for Nebraska, like\r\nthe one he had promised to vote for, and said that if, at the expiration\r\nof that time, he could not introduce such a bill, which would not at the\r\nsame time accord with his own sense of right and justice to the South,\r\nhe would resign as chairman of the territorial committee, and Democratic\r\ncaucus, and exert his influence to get Atchison appointed. At the\r\nexpiration of the given time, Judge Douglass signified his intention to\r\nreport such a bill.\r\n\r\n“General Atchison next spoke of those who had supported and those who\r\nhad opposed the bill in the Senate, and ended by saying that the\r\nAmerican people loved honesty and could appreciate the acts of a man who\r\nopenly and above-board voted according to the will of his constituents,\r\nwithout political regard or favor. He expressed his profound contempt\r\nfor abolitionists, and said if he had his way he would hang everyone of\r\nthem that dared to show his face, but he knew that Northern men settling\r\nin the Territory were sensible and honest, and that the right feeling\r\nmen among them would be as far from stealing a negro as a Southern man\r\nwould.\r\n\r\n“When Senator Atchison concluded his remarks, the sale of town lots\r\nbegan, and thirty-four were sold that afternoon, at an average of $63.00\r\neach. Most of those that were sold were some distance back from the\r\nriver, and speculators were not present, so far as it could be\r\ndetermined, and lots that were sold were bought mostly by owners of the\r\ntown. Prices ranged from $35.00 to $200.00.”\r\n\r\nAt this meeting the projects of building a hotel and establishing a\r\nnewspaper were discussed, and as a result, each of the original 100\r\nshares was assessed $25.00, and in the following spring the National\r\nHotel, corner of Second and Atchison streets, was built. Dr. J. H.\r\nStringfellow and Robert S. Kelley received a donation of $400.00 from\r\nthe town company, to buy a printing office and in February, 1855, the\r\n_Squatter Sovereign_, which subsequently did so much for the pro-slavery\r\ncause, was born.\r\n\r\nThe town company required each settler to build a house at least sixteen\r\nfeet square upon his lot, so that when the survey was made in 1855 many\r\nfound themselves upon school lands. Among those who put up homes in 1854\r\nand 1855 were James T. Darnell, Archibald Elliott, Thomas J. C. Duncan,\r\nAndrew W. Pebler, R. S. Kelley, F. B. Wilson, Henry Kline and William\r\nHassett. The titles to the lands owned by these residents remained\r\nunsettled until 1857, when titles to all lands within the townsite and\r\nopen to settlement were acquired from the federal government, and\r\nsubsequently the title to school lands was secured by patents from the\r\nTerritory, and in this way the town company secured a clear title to all\r\nlands which they had heretofore conveyed, and re-conveyed the same to\r\nthe settlers and purchasers. Dr. J. H. Stringfellow, proprietor of North\r\nAtchison, an addition to the city of Atchison, employed J. J. Pratt to\r\nsurvey that addition in October, 1857. It consisted of the northeast\r\nquarter of the northeast quarter of section 36, township 5, range 20.\r\nSamuel Dickson, who was the proprietor of South Atchison, had that\r\naddition platted in May, 1858, and John Roberts, who was the proprietor\r\nof West Atchison, had his addition surveyed in February, 1858, a few\r\nmonths before Samuel Dickson surveyed South Atchison. C. L. Challiss’\r\naddition was surveyed about the same time. Other additions to the\r\ncorporate limits of Atchison have been made, and are as follows:\r\nBranchton, Bird’s addition, Brandner’s addition, Bakewell Heights,\r\nBatiste addition, Florence Park, Forest Park, Goodhue Place, Garfield\r\nPark, Highland Park, Home Place, Howard Heights, LaGrande addition,\r\nLincoln Park, Llewellyn Heights, Lutheran Church addition, Mapleton\r\nPlace, Merkles addition, Parker’s addition, Park Place, Price Villa\r\naddition, River View addition, Spring Garden, Style’s addition, Bellvue\r\nHeights, and Talbott & Company’s addition.\r\n\r\nAtchison was incorporated as a town by act of the Territorial\r\nlegislature, August 30, 1855, but it was not incorporated as a city\r\nuntil February 12, 1858, after which the charter was approved by the\r\npeople by special election, March 2, 1858. In the fall of 1856, Atchison\r\nhad obtained a great many advantages over other towns along the river,\r\nby a judicious system of advertising. The _Squatter Sovereign_ printed a\r\ncircular November 22, 1856, which was scattered broadcast. The circular\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n“To the public, generally, but particularly to those persons living\r\nnorth of the Kansas river, in Kansas Territory:\r\n\r\n“It is well known to many, and should be to all interested, that the\r\ntown of Atchison is nearer to most persons living north of the Kansas\r\nriver, than any other point on the Missouri river. The country, too,\r\nsouth of the Kansas river above Lecompton, is also as near Atchison as\r\nany other Missouri river town. The roads to Atchison in every direction\r\nare very fine, and always in good repair for wagon and other modes of\r\ntravel. The country opposite Atchison is not excelled by any section of\r\nMissouri, it being portions of Buchanan and Platte counties, in a high\r\nstate of cultivation, and at a considerable distance from any important\r\ntown in Missouri, making grain, fruit, provisions and all kinds of\r\nmarketing easily procured at fair prices; a matter of no small\r\nconsideration to settlers in a new country.\r\n\r\n“The great fresh water lake, from which the fish markets of St. Joseph\r\nand Weston are supplied, is also within three miles of Atchison.\r\n\r\n“Atchison is now well supplied with all kinds of goods: groceries,\r\nflour, corn, meal, provisions and marketing of all kinds are abundant,\r\nand at fair prices. To show the compatibility of Atchison to supply the\r\ndemands of the country, we here enumerate some of the business houses,\r\nviz: Six large dry goods and grocery stores, wholesale and retail; six\r\nfamily grocery and provision stores, wholesale and retail; one large\r\nclothing store; one extensive furniture store, with mattresses and\r\nbedding of all sorts; one stove, sheet iron and tinware establishment,\r\nwhere articles in that line are sold at St. Louis prices; several large\r\nwarehouses sufficient to store all the goods of emigrants and traders\r\nacross the plains, and to Kansas Territory; one weekly newspaper—_The\r\nSquatter Sovereign_—having the largest circulation of any newspaper in\r\nKansas, with press, type and materials to execute all kinds of job work;\r\ntwo commodious hotels, and several boarding houses; one bakery and\r\nconfectionery; three blacksmith shops; two wagon makers, and several\r\ncarpenter shops; one cabinet maker; two boot and shoe maker shops, and\r\nsaddle and harness maker shops; one extensive butcher and meat market; a\r\nfirst rate ferry, on which is kept a magnificent new steam ferry boat\r\nand excellent horse boat, propelled by horses; a good flat boat, and\r\nseveral skiffs; saw mills, two propelled by steam and one by horse-\r\npower; two brick yards, and two lime kilns.\r\n\r\n“A fine supply of professional gentlemen of all branches constantly on\r\nhand equal to the demand.\r\n\r\n“A good grist mill is much needed, and would make money for the owner.”\r\n\r\nThe first business house in Atchison was established by George T.\r\nChalliss, at the corner of the Levee and Commercial streets, in August,\r\n1854. The National Hotel was not built at that time, so Mr. Challiss\r\nestablished a temporary camp, and his workmen were accommodated under an\r\nelm tree near the river. The Challiss store building was torn down in\r\n1872. George T. Challiss and his brother, Luther C. Challiss, were\r\nclerking in a dry goods store at Booneville, Mo., in the spring of 1854.\r\nGeorge T. Challiss returned to his old home in New Jersey on a visit,\r\nand upon his return, in August, he came direct to Atchison. He came by\r\nboat to Weston, Mo., where he met P. T. Abell, president of the town\r\ncompany, and Abell prevailed upon him to come to Atchison in a buggy,\r\ncrossing the river here on George Million’s ferry. Mr. Abell donated Mr.\r\nChalliss the lot upon which he built his store, and he went to Rushville\r\nand bought enough cottonwood lumber to build it. When he arrived in\r\nAtchison, he had $4.50 in money, but later on borrowed $150.00 from his\r\nbrother, Luther C. Challiss, at Boonville. He enjoyed a good business\r\nfrom the beginning, and carried a large stock of both dry goods and\r\ngroceries.\r\n\r\nThe town of Atchison was the one big outstanding factor in Atchison\r\ncounty when the territory was organized, but at the same time that Abell\r\nand Stringfellow and others “were shaping up the town,” others were busy\r\norganizing the county. As the city was named for General Atchison, so\r\nlikewise was the county at the time of its creation by the first\r\nTerritorial legislature that assembled at Pawnee. The first board of\r\ncounty commissioners was selected and appointed by the Territorial\r\nlegislature, August 31, 1855, and was composed of William J. Young,\r\nJames M. Givens and James A. Headley. The first meeting of the board was\r\nheld September 17, 1855, at the home of O. B. Dickerson, in the city of\r\nAtchison. At this meeting Ira Norris was appointed clerk and recorder;\r\nSamuel Dickson, treasurer; Samuel Walters, assessor. William McVay had\r\nreceived an appointment as sheriff of the county prior to the meeting of\r\nthe board, direct from the governor, to fill the office temporarily\r\nuntil his successor was subsequently appointed and qualified. On the\r\n18th of September, 1855, being the second day of the session of the\r\nfirst board of county commissioners, Eli C. Mason was appointed as\r\nsheriff to succeed McVay, and Dudley McVay was appointed coroner. Voting\r\nprecincts were established in three townships preparatory to an election\r\nof a delegate to Congress, which was to take place the first Monday in\r\nOctober, 1855. At the October meeting of the board of county\r\ncommissioners, block 10, in what is now known as Old Atchison, was\r\naccepted by the board as a location upon which to erect a court house.\r\nThis property was offered to the county by the Atchison town company for\r\nthe purpose of influencing the board to make Atchison the county seat.\r\nThe conditions of the gift were that the court house was to be built of\r\nbrick and to be at least forty feet square. In the following spring the\r\ntown company donated fifty town lots, and the proceeds of these lots\r\nwere to be used in the construction of the court house. In June, 1857,\r\nthe court house was ordered built and it was to be two stories high, the\r\nfirst story to be of rock and the second story of wood. It was 24×18\r\nfeet square: however, the plans were subsequently changed, and, because\r\nof the gift of an additional fourteen lots by the town company, of a\r\nvalue of $6,000.00, a more pretentious building was erected in 1859,\r\nwith a county jail adjoining it. Prior to the erection of the court\r\nhouse, there was a spirited contest between Mt. Pleasant, Monrovia,\r\nLancaster and Sumner over the question of the county seat. In an\r\nelection to determine the location, Atchison received a majority of 252\r\nvotes over all competitors for the county seat. The estimated total\r\npopulation of the county at the time was 2,745.\r\n\r\nIn the next few years Atchison grew rapidly and the dreams of Senator\r\nAtchison and his associates bade fair to be realized on a large scale.\r\nThe population of the town was about 500, and yet there were eight\r\nhardware stores, twelve dry goods stores, eight wholesale grocery\r\nstores, nineteen retail grocery stores, and twenty-six law firms. The\r\nbanking business was controlled by the contracting firms of A. Majors &\r\nCompany and Smoot, Russell & Company. The Atchison branch of the Kansas\r\nValley Bank was the first in the State to be formed under the\r\nlegislative act, authorized February 19, 1857, with a capital stock of\r\n$300,000.00. In the act, John H. Stringfellow, Joseph Plean and Samuel\r\nDickson were named to open subscription books. An organization was\r\neffected in the spring of 1858, and the capital stock of the local\r\norganization was $52,000.00. The board of directors was composed of\r\nSamuel C. Pomeroy, president; W. H. Russell, L. R. Smoot, W. B. Waddell,\r\nF. G. Adams, Samuel Dickson and W. E. Gaylord. There was considerable\r\nrivalry between Sumner and Doniphan at the time, and shortly after the\r\norganization of the bank, a rumor, which was supposed to have started in\r\nSumner, to the effect that the bank was about to suspend, caused the\r\ndirectors to publish a statement of its condition, showing that its\r\nassets were $36,638.00 and its liabilities $20,118.00. S. C. Pomeroy\r\nresigned as president before the year was out and was succeeded by\r\nWilliam H. Russell. The bank subsequently had its name changed by the\r\nlegislature to the Bank of the State of Kansas. Mr. Russell, the second\r\npresident of the bank, made his home in Leavenworth and was an active\r\npro-slavery man, being treasurer of the executive committee in 1856 to\r\nraise funds to make Kansas a slave State. This bank continued until\r\n1866, when it went into voluntary liquidation and its stockholders wound\r\nup its affairs.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important institutions in Atchison in the early days was\r\nthe Massasoit House, opened for business September 1, 1858, in charge of\r\nTom Murphy, a genial proprietor, who conducted it for many years. At the\r\nsame time there were three other hotels in operation in the city.\r\nReference has heretofore been made to the National Hotel, which was\r\nelected in 1855 by popular subscription. It was a plain log structure on\r\nthe north side of Atchison street, just east of Second, overlooking the\r\nriver. The Tremont House was a two-story frame structure at the\r\nsoutheast corner of Second and Main, and the Planters’ House was at the\r\nsouthwest corner of Commercial and Sixth streets on the site now\r\noccupied by the Exchange National Bank, but the Massasoit House was the\r\nleading hotel of this section and it was a substantial, somewhat\r\nimposing frame building erected at the northwest corner of Second and\r\nMain streets on the site now occupied by the Wherrett-Mize Wholesale\r\nDrug House. It was three stories high with a basement and was handsomely\r\nfurnished. It did a large business and was the headquarters for the\r\noverland staging crowds. All the lines, which ran in every direction,\r\nout of Atchison at that time departed from the Massasoit House. It was a\r\nfavorite place for political gatherings, and from its balconies many\r\nspeeches were made by leaders of the political parties of that day. It\r\nat one time was the hiding place for a number of slaves who had been\r\nsecreted in the hotel by their master. Horace Greeley, the famous editor\r\nof the _New York Tribune_, ate his first dinner in Kansas at this hotel,\r\nand Abraham Lincoln was a guest on the day that John Brown was executed\r\nat Harper’s Ferry.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the magnitude of the merchandising that was carried on in\r\nAtchison in 1858 may be gathered from the fact that during the summer of\r\nthat year twenty-four trains comprising 775 wagons, 1,114 men, 7,963\r\noxen, 142 horses, 1,286 mules conveyed 3,730,905 pounds of merchandise\r\nacross the Rocky mountains and California. One single train that was\r\nsent out that year consisted of 105 wagons, 225 men, 1,000 oxen, 200\r\nmules, fifty horses and 465,500 pounds of merchandise. During the latter\r\npart of 1859 and the early months of 1860, forty-one regular traders and\r\nfreighters did business out of Atchison. During nine months of one of\r\nthose years, the trains outfitted from Atchison were drawn by mules and\r\ncattle and comprised 1,328 wagons, 1,549 men, 401 mules and 15,263 oxen.\r\nThe Pike’s Peak gold mines, which were discovered in 1858, and the\r\nprospecting in that region were the causes of the larger part of this\r\nenormous business. Denver at that time had a population of about 2,500,\r\nand was the center of the mining region around Pike’s Peak. In the\r\nperiod just mentioned, thirty-three of the trains that left Atchison\r\nwere destined for Denver. One of these trains was composed of 125\r\nwagons, carrying 750,000 pounds of merchandise. It extended from the\r\nlevee on the river far beyond the western outskirts of the city. The\r\noutfit was managed by fifty-two men, twenty-two mules and 1,542 oxen.\r\nSeveral of the trains for Denver had from twenty to fifty wagons. One,\r\nsent out by Jones & Cartwright, had fifty-eight wagons and carried over\r\n3,000 pounds of merchandise. Among the trains that left Atchison during\r\nthe latter part of 1859 were, one for Santa Fe, N. M., another for\r\nColorado City, Colo., two for Green River, Wyo., and four for Salt Lake\r\nCity. The biggest overland outfit was owned by Irwin, Jackson & Company,\r\nwho were Government freighters. During one season this firm sent out 520\r\nwagons, 650 men, 75 mules and 6,240 oxen. This firm had a good contract\r\nfor supplying the military posts on the plains, including Forts Kearney,\r\nLaramie, Bridger, Douglas, and Camp Floyd, a short distance from Salt\r\nLake City. In addition to these larger overland staging concerns there\r\nwere a number of lesser outfits sent out by private parties in Atchison,\r\nwith one, two or three wagons each. Most of the freight conveyed across\r\nthe plains in wagons was brought to Atchison in steamboats, which\r\nunloaded at the levee extending along two or three blocks, beginning at\r\nabout Atchison street and running south. Very frequently loaded ox\r\ntrains nearly a mile in length were seen on Commercial street, and some\r\nof the prairie schooners would be loaded with hardware or some other\r\ndead weight, drawn by six to eight yoke of cattle; and more wagon trains\r\nwere loaded and departed from Atchison than from any other point on the\r\nMissouri river.\r\n\r\nThe act of the Territorial legislature of Kansas incorporating the city\r\nof Atchison was approved February 12, 1858, and it provided for the\r\nelection of a mayor and councilmen. The charter was voted upon and\r\naccepted by the people at a special election held March 2, 1858, and the\r\nfirst mayor and council were elected at a special election March 13,\r\n1858. The charter provided for an annual city election at that time to\r\nbe held on the first Monday in September, and consequently the first\r\nmayor and councilmen of the city, elected in March, held their offices\r\nonly until the following September. Samuel C. Pomeroy was the first\r\nmayor of the city, holding his office from March, 1858, until May, 1859.\r\nPomeroy was one of the prominent Free State settlers and was one of its\r\nmost popular citizens. His election as mayor was the result of the toss\r\nof a coin. A temporary truce having been effected between the\r\nSoutherners and the Free State men, it was agreed that a compromise in\r\nlocal affairs would be beneficial to the community. By the toss of a\r\ncoin the Free State men won the mayor and three councilmen, and the pro-\r\nslavery men had four councilmen. Pomeroy was named by the Free State men\r\nmayor. Pomeroy subsequently became actively identified with the\r\nMassachusetts Emigrant Aid Association, in the distribution of aid to\r\nthe stricken people of Kansas following the great drought of 1860, and\r\nit was largely because of his identification with this organization that\r\nhe was enabled to place aid where it would do the most good, and he\r\nsubsequently became one of the first United States senators from Kansas.\r\nWhen he was a resident of Atchison he lived at the corner of North\r\nTerrace and Santa Fe streets, but later he moved to a tract of land near\r\nMuscotah, and during the twelve years he was senator he claimed the\r\nlatter place as his home. It was when he asked for a third term as\r\nUnited States senator that he was exposed on the floor of the State\r\nsenate by Senator York, who arose in his place and, advancing to the\r\nsecretary’s desk, placed $7,000.00 in cash thereon, which he alleged\r\nPomeroy had given him to influence his vote. Many have always believed\r\nthat Senator Pomeroy was greatly wronged by this act of York. Ex-\r\nGovernor George W. Glick, himself a Democrat and a leading citizen of\r\nAtchison in the early days, was a very warm friend of Pomeroy and always\r\nexpressed indignation when he heard Pomeroy abused, not only about his\r\nconduct in connection with the Emigrant Aid Association, but also in\r\nconnection with his downfall politically. It was the contention of\r\nGovernor Glick that Pomeroy’s fall was the result of a conspiracy and\r\nnot because of general bribery. However, Pomeroy never rose to political\r\nprominence after this incident and ended his days in Washington, D. C.,\r\nwhere he lived for a number of years prior to his death.\r\n\r\nAssociated with Pomeroy as the first mayor of Atchison, were the\r\nfollowing citizens: John F. Stein, Jr. register; E. B. Grimes,\r\ntreasurer; Milton R. Benton, marshal; A. E. Mayhew, city attorney; W. O.\r\nGould, city engineer; M. R. Benton, by virtue of his office as marshal,\r\nwas also street commissioner; H. L. Davis, assessor; Dr. J. W. Hereford,\r\ncity physician. The board of appraisers was composed of Messrs. Petfish,\r\nRoswell and Gaylord. The first councilmen were William P. Childs, O. F.\r\nShort, Luther C. Challiss, Cornelius E. Logan, S. F. Walters, James A.\r\nHeadley, Charles Holbert. John F. Stein, who was register, resigned his\r\noffice in August, and R. L. Pease was appointed to succeed him. In the\r\nfollowing August the city was divided into three wards, the first ward\r\nbeing entitled to four councilmen, the second ward to two, and the third\r\nward to three. At the first meeting of the council, which was held March\r\n15, 1858, an ordinance was adopted providing for a special election for\r\nthe purpose of submitting a proposition to take $100,000.00 of stock in\r\na proposed railroad from St. Joseph, Mo., to some point opposite\r\nAtchison on the Missouri river. The election was held and the stock was\r\nsubscribed for. Mayor Pomeroy was appointed agent of the proposed road,\r\nwhich was to be known as the Atchison & St. Joseph Railroad Company. A\r\nfurther account of the development of railroad building from Atchison\r\nwill occur in a subsequent chapter. The council at this session also\r\nfixed the salary of the mayor, and in spite of the freedom of those\r\ndays, saloons were ordered to be closed on Sunday, and other stringent\r\nregulations were passed in connection with the liquor traffic. The first\r\nfinancial statement of the city, of date September 5, 1859, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n General city tax, 1858                                       $ 5,927.70\r\n Fines imposed by mayor’s court                                   186.50\r\n Dray and wagon licenses                                          192.00\r\n Dram shop licenses                                             1,787.76\r\n Beer house licenses                                              101.33\r\n Shows                                                            130.00\r\n Billiard tables                                                  225.00\r\n Registry of dogs                                                  50.00\r\n Assessment on C street from River to Fourth                    3,381.00\r\n                                                               —————————\r\n                            Total                             $12,008.29\r\n\r\n Amount of scrip and orders issued on general fund to\r\n   December 15, 1858                                          $ 6,317.17\r\n Amount of scrip and orders issued on general fund to\r\n   September 5, 1859                                            3,140.53\r\n Scrip issued toward building jail                              1,675.00\r\n Scrip issued for grading streets, curbing, etc.               10,105.39\r\n                                                               —————————\r\n                            Total                             $21,238.09\r\n                                                               —————————\r\n General deficit                                              $ 9,229.79\r\n\r\nThe fact that Mayor Pomeroy had strongly urged in his inaugural address\r\nthe importance of grading and improving the streets of the city\r\n“especially Atchison, Second and Fourth streets, and the levee,”\r\npossibly accounts for the indebtedness of the city at so early a date.\r\nThere was a general inclination among the citizens of Atchison to build\r\na modern city in accordance with the standards of the times, and\r\ntherefore they were anxious to follow the mayor’s advice to put their\r\nstreets and alleys in order.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and at the same time one of the most\r\ndifficult tasks in tracing the settlement of a community, is to\r\ncorrectly catalogue the establishment of the first settler, the first\r\nhouse, the first business institution, and the first of everything, and\r\nit could with safety be said that this is not only an interesting and\r\ndifficult task but it is well nigh an impossible one. This is not to be\r\nwondered at when we take into account the rush and confusion which\r\nalways attend the settlement of a new community. However, it has now\r\nbecome an established fact that George M. Million was the first white\r\nsettler in the Territory, with Samuel Dickson a close second. There was\r\nsome dispute about who built the first house in the town of Atchison,\r\nbut we have resolved all doubt in favor of Dickson, just as we have\r\ndecided that George T. Challiss established the first business house.\r\nThe Challiss brothers, George, Luther and William all played an\r\nimportant part in the very early history of the county. They were in\r\nbusiness and in the professions, and they were all land owners,\r\nselecting the choicest tracts “close in” and holding onto them, none too\r\nwisely or too well, for their tenacity in this respect later resulted in\r\ntheir undoing. The leading lawyers in the county during those days were\r\nM. J. Ireland, A. G. Otis, Isaac Hascall, James A. Headley, A. E.\r\nMayhew, J. T. Hereford, P. H. Larey, Joseph P. Carr and B. F.\r\nStringfellow. Horton, Foster, Ingalls, and General Bela M. Hughes came\r\nlater. Hascall carried a card in the _Squatter Sovereign_, advertising\r\nhis legal headquarters as the Border Ruffian Law Office.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the names of merchants and professional men heretofore\r\ngiven, “Andreas’ History of Kansas” gives the following list: Grafton\r\nThomassen, the slave owner, ran a sawmill. Thomassen’s name appears in\r\nthe records of Atchison county in connection with land transfers as\r\nGrafton Thomason; Luther C. Challiss, who occupied a store on the levee,\r\n45 by 100 feet which he filled with dry goods and groceries, and\r\nadvertised “such an assortment as was never before offered for sale in\r\nthe upper country”; Samuel Dickson, a merchant and politician and also\r\nan auctioneer, on the north side of C street; Lewis Burnes, M. P. Rively\r\nand Stephen Johnson carried stocks of assorted merchandise; A. J. G.\r\nWestbrook, a grocer, and Patrick Laughlin, who fled from Doniphan on\r\naccount of the murder of Collins, the Free State man, was a tinner;\r\nWilliam C. Null and Albert G. Schmitt operated a warehouse and carried a\r\ngeneral stock of merchandise at the corner of Second and C streets;\r\nCharles E. Woolfolk and Robert H. Cavell had a large store and warehouse\r\nat the steamboat landing; George M. Million operated the Pioneer Saloon;\r\nJohn Robertson conducted a saddlery and harness business; Messrs.\r\nJackson & Ireland were a contracting firm with a shop over Samuel\r\nDickson’s store; Uncle Sam Clothing Store, at the corner of C and Third\r\nstreets, was conducted by Jacob Saqui & Company; Giles B. Buck sold\r\nstoves on C street; O. B. Dickson was proprietor of the Atchison House;\r\nDrs. J. H. Stringfellow and D. M. McVay were the leading physicians; and\r\nit is interesting to note that Washburn’s Great American Colossal\r\nCircus, which was the first in Kansas, gave two exhibitions in Atchison,\r\nJuly 31, 1856. This aggregation carried three clowns, a full brass and\r\nstring band and an immense pavilion, and many other novel and attractive\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nFully fifty new buildings were erected during the spring and summer of\r\n1856.\r\n\r\nDuring this period in the history of the county, Free State people began\r\nto come into their own. They grew bolder, following the compromise with\r\nthe pro-slavery citizens, over the question of the distribution of city\r\nofficers and because of other concessions that were made by the pro-\r\nslavery citizens for the general good of the community. It was not\r\nstrange, therefore, that some of the less tactful and politic Free State\r\nleaders should over-reach themselves at such a time. While the “Reign of\r\nTerrorism” under the Stringfellow regime was on, the Free State men in\r\nAtchison county considered discretion the better part of valor. They\r\nwere very quiet, with few exceptions, of whom Pardee Butler was a\r\nconspicuous example, but they were nevertheless quite numerous in the\r\ncounty, and particularly was this the case in and around Monrovia, Eden\r\nand Ocena; in fact, there was an organization of Free State men in the\r\ncounty as early as 1857, and several quiet meetings were held that year;\r\nand at Monrovia a society was formed, of which Franklin G. Adams was the\r\nchief officer and spokesman.\r\n\r\nEarly in May, 1857, Senator Pomeroy and the Free State men bought the\r\n_Squatter Sovereign_ from Dr. Stringfellow, and Mr. Adams and Robert\r\nMcBratney became its editors. Mr. Adams was just as ardent a Free State\r\nman as Dr. Stringfellow was the other way, so the policy of the paper\r\nwas completely reversed. Judge Adams was a lawyer and partner of John J.\r\nIngalls for a while. He represented Atchison county in the\r\nconstitutional convention that met in Mineola March 23, 1858 and which\r\nsubsequently adjourned to Leavenworth. Caleb May, G. M. Fuller, C. A.\r\nWoodworth and H. E. Baker were the other delegates from Atchison county.\r\nJudge Adams was later one of the useful men of Kansas, and at the time\r\nof his death he was secretary of the State Historical Society, which\r\nposition he filled with credit and honor for many years. On August 22,\r\n1858, following the local compromise with the pro-slavery leaders, Judge\r\nAdams concluded the time was ripe to invite James H. Lane, the great\r\nFree State leader, to Atchison, to make a speech. He consequently served\r\nnotice in his paper that Lane would be in Atchison October 19. As soon\r\nas it was generally known that Lane had been invited to speak in\r\nAtchison a number of the more rabid pro-slavery men concluded that the\r\nspeaking would not take place. On the other hand, Judge Adams was just\r\nas determined that Lane would have a public meeting in Atchison. For the\r\npurpose of insuring order on that occasion Adams invited a number of\r\nstrong and reliable Free State friends from Leavenworth to come up to\r\nAtchison and see that fair play was done. The invitation to the\r\nLeavenworth Free Soilers was accepted with alacrity and they arrived on\r\nthe morning of the day Lane was billed to make his speech and brought\r\nwith them their side arms as a matter of precaution. They made the\r\noffice of Adams, Swift & Company their headquarters while here. Shortly\r\nafter the arrival of the Leavenworth contingent and while sitting in his\r\noffice Judge Adams noticed a crowd gathering on Commercial street, near\r\nFifth. Suspecting that the crowd had gathered for no good purpose, Judge\r\nAdams and six of his friends started for the scene of what appeared to\r\nhim to be a disturbance. On their way they met Caleb A. Woodworth, Sr.,\r\nhatless and apparently in trouble. As Judge Adams stopped to make\r\ninquiries of Mr. Woodworth regarding his trouble somebody from the rear\r\nassaulted him with a heavy blow on the cheek. Instead of following the\r\nBiblical injunction he did not turn his other cheek, but swung quickly\r\nin his tracks and levelled a pistol at his assailant, who was\r\naccompanied by a crowd of his friends, all armed and with blood in their\r\neyes. As Judge Adams was about to pull the trigger of his gun a friend\r\nof Judge Adams shouted, “Don’t shoot yet!” following which admonition\r\nall of the crowd displayed cocked revolvers and aimed them in the\r\ndirection of Judge Adams and his crowd. Observing that the Free Soilers\r\nmeant business, the pro-slavery men discreetly withdrew without further\r\ntrouble, and the Free Soil men returned to the office of Judge Adams. It\r\nwas then determined that the meeting should be an out-of-door one, and\r\nas they passed out into the street, again the pro-slavery advocates\r\nmixed freely with the Free Soilers. A. J. W. Westbrook, of the “Home\r\nGuards,” mounted on a prancing horse, rode among the crowd, flourishing\r\na cocked gun, apparently seeking to kill Judge Adams at the first\r\nfavorable opportunity. It has been doubted that Westbrook meant\r\nbusiness, but his conduct had the effect of stirring up his followers\r\nwho avowed that Jim Lane should not speak in Atchison that night. His\r\nthreatening attitude apparently had the desired effect, for the Free\r\nSoil men decided that it was not necessary for the existence of their\r\ncause that Jim Lane should speak and therefore postponed the speaking.\r\nJudge Adams was not altogether pleased but he was finally prevailed upon\r\nto return home without attempting further trouble. Later in the day a\r\nparty of Free Soil men met General Lane on the outskirts of the city,\r\nreturning from Doniphan where he had been speaking, and prevailed upon\r\nhim not to come to Atchison. This was not the first attempt of Lane to\r\nvisit Atchison county. He was entertained at dinner in 1855 at the home\r\nof Dr. J. H. Stringfellow, whose house occupied the site where the home\r\nof Ex-Governor W. J. Bailey now stands. The fact that Lane was a guest\r\nof Dr. Stringfellow will appear strange to those who knew nothing of the\r\nStringfellow family. While they were belligerent pro-slavery advocates,\r\nthey were always high class men with decent instincts and therefore it\r\nwould not be unusual for them to open their home to so violent an\r\nopponent of theirs as Lane was. The eastern papers, in giving an account\r\nof Lane’s entertainment at the Stringfellow home, stated that the dinner\r\nwas a very elaborate one, including oysters, plum pudding, terrapin and\r\nchampagne. Mrs. Stringfellow told E. W. Howe in 1894 that Lane came to\r\nthe house about 11 o’clock in the morning attended by a body-guard of\r\nfour men and inquired for Dr. Stringfellow. The Doctor was away at the\r\ntime, but was expected about noon. The men said that they would wait,\r\nwhereupon Mrs. Stringfellow knew that she would probably have them for\r\ndinner. Her girl was just getting ready to go somewhere on an errand and\r\nwas asked to remain at the house. Dr. Stringfellow came in about noon\r\nand when the two men met in the yard Stringfellow asked Lane if he was\r\nnot afraid to call at his house. “I am not afraid,” Lane replied, “to\r\ncall on a gentleman anywhere.” This gallantry captured Mrs.\r\nStringfellow’s admiration and she invited Lane and his body-guard to\r\ndinner, which, contrary to the report in the eastern papers, was a very\r\nsimple one. Mrs. Stringfellow, in her interview with Mr. Howe, said that\r\nit was as follows: Coffee, hot biscuits and butter, cold pie, preserves\r\nand milk; no terrapin, no oysters, no champagne, no plum pudding. Lane\r\ncalled at the house on a matter of business and Mrs. Stringfellow said\r\nthat Lane and his body-guard were very kindly genteel men. Two or three\r\nweeks later, when Mrs. Stringfellow was alone in the house, she saw a\r\nwagon pass in the road with three or four men lying down in it.\r\nPresently another wagon, similarly loaded, attracted her attention. Then\r\ncame four men and a woman on horseback and several men on foot. The\r\npeople came from down town, or from southwest of town. The circumstances\r\nwere peculiar, and Mrs. Stringfellow climbed on top of a table and\r\nwatched the men through the upper sash of a window. They stopped in a\r\nlittle glade northeast of the house, when the woman dismounted from the\r\nhorse, took off the skirt and turned out to be Jim Lane. He stood beside\r\nthe horse and talked possibly half an hour. Mrs. Stringfellow is certain\r\nthe speaker was Lane, because she had seen him only a few weeks before,\r\nand he rode the white horse he had ridden when he stopped at her house,\r\nand the same four men composed the body-guard. Lane had threatened to\r\nmake a speech in the town but had been warned not to, as he had been\r\nwarned two years earlier. He made his speech in spite of the warning,\r\nbut his audience was composed of his friends only. A half hour after\r\nLane disappeared over the hill toward the farm then owned by John\r\nTaylor, some distance south of the Orphans’ Home, forty mounted\r\nsoutherners appeared looking for him. Mrs. Stringfellow knew John Scott,\r\nthe leader, and told him of the incident. The men laughed and then gave\r\nthree rousing cheers for Jim Lane, who had outwitted them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Forest Park, Atchison, Kansas\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile there was a tremendous traffic across the plains from Atchison in\r\n1857, 1858 and 1859, and for a number of years later the “town was alive\r\nwith business,” it is only fair to record that the town itself was not a\r\nthing of beauty and a joy forever, in spite of the efforts of Mayor\r\nPomeroy and the city fathers who put the city in debt to the extent of\r\n$9,000, September 5, 1859, for public improvements.\r\n\r\nFrank A. Root in his admirable book, “The Overland Stage to California,”\r\npublished in 1901, has this to say in part upon his arrival here in\r\nNovember, 1858:\r\n\r\n“It was in November, 1858, that I first set foot on the levee in\r\nAtchison. I stepped from the steamer, ‘Omaha,’ which boat was\r\ndischarging its cargo of freight at the foot of Commercial street. At\r\nthat time the place was a very small town. I took up my residence in\r\nAtchison the following spring, having this time come up the river on a\r\nsteamboat from Weston where I had been employed as a compositor in the\r\noffice of the _Platte Argus_. On landing at Atchison I had a solitary\r\ndime in my pocket, and, after using that to pay for my lunch, I started\r\nout in search of a job. A sign over the office which read: ‘Freedom’s\r\nChampion, John A. Martin, Editor and Publisher,’ attracted my attention.\r\nIt hung above the door of the only newspaper office in the city at that\r\ntime, but preparations were then being made by Gideon O. Chase, of\r\nWaverly, N. Y., to start the _Atchison Union_, which was to be a\r\nDemocratic paper. I secured a place in the _Champion_ office, beginning\r\nwork the following morning. As I walked about the town I remember of\r\nhaving seen but four brick buildings on Commercial street. A part of the\r\nsecond story of one of them, about half a square west of the river, was\r\noccupied by the _Champion_. The Massasoit House was the leading hotel.\r\nThe Planters, a two-story frame house, was a good hotel in those early\r\ndays, but it was too far out to be convenient, located as it was, on the\r\ncorner of Commercial and Sixth streets. West of Sixth there were but few\r\nscattering dwellings and perhaps a dozen business houses and shops. The\r\nroad along Commercial street, west of Sixth, was crooked, for it had not\r\nbeen graded and the streets were full of stumps and remnants of a thick\r\ngrowth of underbrush that had previously been cut. A narrow, rickety\r\nbridge was spanning White Clay creek where that stream crosses\r\nCommercial street at Seventh street. Between Sixth and Seventh streets,\r\nnorth of Commercial street there was a frog pond occupying most of the\r\nblock, where the boys pulled dog-grass in highwater, and where both boys\r\nand girls skated in winter. The Exchange hotel on Atchison street,\r\nbetween Second and the Levee, built of logs—subsequently changed to the\r\nNational—was the principal hotel of Atchison, and for more than a\r\nquarter of a century stood as an old familiar landmark, built in early\r\nterritorial days.\r\n\r\n“Atchison was the first Kansas town visited by Horace Greeley. It was\r\nSunday morning, May 15, 1859, a few days before beginning his overland\r\njourney across the continent by stage. He came through Missouri by the\r\nHannibal & St. Joseph Railroad, thence down the Missouri river from St.\r\nJoseph on the ‘Platte Valley,’ a steamer then running to Kansas City in\r\nconnection with trains on the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad. It was in\r\nthe old Massasoit House that Greeley wrote on Kansas soil, his first\r\nletter to the _Tribune_. During the latter part of the afternoon he was\r\ndriven over the city in a carriage, John A. Martin being one of the\r\nparty. The city was a favorite place of Albert D. Richardson, the noted\r\ncorrespondent of five eastern newspapers.\r\n\r\n“It was at Atchison that Abraham Lincoln, on his first visit to Kansas,\r\nspoke to a crowded house on ‘The Issues of the Day,’ December 2, 1859,\r\nthe date that old John Brown was executed in Virginia. Lincoln spoke in\r\nthe Methodist church, which then stood on the hill at the corner of\r\nFifth and Parallel streets. The little church was a frame building,\r\ndedicated in May, 1859, and overlooked a considerable portion of the\r\ncity. The house afterwards became quite historic, for during the early\r\npart of the Civil war, the patriotic Rev. Milton Mahin, a stanch Union\r\nman, from Indiana, in a patriotic speech, soon after the Civil war broke\r\nout, had the nerve, and was the first minister of the Gospel in\r\nAtchison, to raise the Stars and Stripes over his house of worship.” D.\r\nW. Wilder, in his “Annals of Kansas,” one of the most wonderful books of\r\nits kind ever published, says that Abraham Lincoln arrived in Elwood,\r\nwhich is just across from St. Joseph, December 1, 1859, and made his\r\nspeech there that evening. He was met at St. Joseph by M. W. Delahay and\r\nD. W. Wilder. The speech that Lincoln delivered at Elwood and at\r\nAtchison was the same speech that he subsequently delivered at the\r\nCooper Institute, New York City, and was considered as one of the ablest\r\nand clearest ever delivered by an American statesman.\r\n\r\nAtchison county was making forward strides at a rapid pace and the\r\nfuture held out every promise of prosperity, but in 1859 “a great famine\r\nfell upon the land.” It did more to depopulate Kansas than all the\r\ntroubles of preceding years. The settlers in the Territory were able to\r\nfight border ruffians with more courage than they could endure\r\nstarvation, and during all of their earlier troubles they confidently\r\nlooked forward to the time when all of their political difficulties\r\nwould be settled and prosperity, peace and contentment would be their\r\nshare in life. During the years of 1855, 1856 and 1857 the citizens of\r\nthe Territory were unable to take advantage of the then favorable\r\nseasons to do more than raise just sufficient for their immediate needs.\r\nDuring the next year immigration to Kansas was large and the new\r\nsettlers had but little time, in addition to building their homes, to\r\nraise barely enough for home consumption, so in 1859 Kansas had only\r\nenough grain on hand to last until the following harvest. The drought\r\ncommenced in June, and from the nineteenth of that month until November,\r\n1860, not a shower of rain fell of any consequence. By fall the ground\r\nwas parched and the hot winds that blew from the south destroyed\r\nvegetation and the wells and springs went dry. There were a few\r\nlocalities on bottom lands along the Missouri river where sufficient\r\ncrops were raised to supply the immediate population, but over 60,000\r\npeople in Kansas faced starvation in the fall of 1860. Thirty thousand\r\nsettlers left the Territory for their old homes, from which they came,\r\nabandoning their claims and all hope of success in Kansas. An endless\r\nprocession crossed the border from day to day. About 70,000 inhabitants\r\nremained, of whom it was estimated 40,000 were able to go through the\r\nwinter. As soon as the news of this situation reached the East,\r\nmovements were inaugurated for the relief of the sufferers in Kansas. S.\r\nC. Pomeroy was appointed general agent of northern Kansas. He did much\r\nto raise liberal contributions in New York, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois\r\nand Ohio, and the contributions were all sent to Atchison, from which\r\nplace they were distributed to the different counties of the State. The\r\ntotal receipts of provisions for distribution up to March 15, 1861, were\r\n8,090,951 pounds, and the total distribution at Atchison, exclusive of\r\nbranch depots, was 6,736,424 pounds. In spite of all of this assistance\r\nover 30,000 settlers in Kansas that year suffered privation and almost\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nIt was during this frightful travail that Kansas as a State was born. On\r\nJanuary 21, 1861, Jefferson Davis and a number of other southern\r\nsenators left the United States Senate and on that day the bill for the\r\nadmission of Kansas under the Wyandotte constitution, which had been\r\nlaid before the House of Representatives in February, 1860, was called\r\nup by W. H. Seward, and passed the Senate by a vote of thirty-six yeas\r\nto sixteen nays. One week later the bill came up in the House on motion\r\nof Galusha A. Grow, of Pennsylvania, who introduced the first bill for\r\nthe admission of Kansas into the Union, and while the motion was out of\r\nthe regular order, it was passed by a vote of 119 yeas to forty-two\r\nnays. On January 29 the bill was signed by President Buchanan, and free\r\nKansas joined the Union.\r\n\r\nThe following are the names of the city officials of Atchison March 1,\r\n1916: Dr. C. C. Finney, mayor; Victor L. King, city clerk; Walter E.\r\nBrown, city attorney; C. A. Wright, city treasurer; Frank S. Altman,\r\ncity engineer; D. S. Beatty, police judge; William H.

Perhaps no county in the State, or for that matter, no county in\r\nthe United States, has been immune from the visitations of town boomers.\r\nIt is difficult in this enterprising age, with all the knowledge that we\r\nnow have at hand, to understand how it was possible for anybody, though\r\nhe was ever so enthusiastic, to conceive the idea that there was any\r\nfuture for many of the “towns” that were born in Atchison county in the\r\nearly days. Yet, it is found that there was in the breasts of many\r\npromoters a feeling that Atchison county offered unlimited possibilities\r\nfor the establishment and growth of towns and cities. One need only\r\nsearch the records on file in the office of the register of deeds in\r\nthis county to discover numerous certified plats of towns which were\r\nborn to blush unseen and waste their fragrance on the desert air. In\r\nsome instances the records are quite complete and authentic, and contain\r\nmuch information with reference to the origin, growth and final decay of\r\nthese nascent municipalities. In other cases nothing has come down to\r\nposterity, save the merest fragmentary data, of which the plat,\r\ncontaining the name of the town and of its organizer, its location and\r\nthe number of blocks, streets and alleys, constitute the major part.\r\n\r\nReference has heretofore been made to the founding and the organization\r\nof the city of Atchison, which became and now remains the county seat of\r\nAtchison county. The city played such an important part in the early\r\nhistory of the county that its story has been woven into the general\r\nfabric of this history, and therefore further reference to the city of\r\nAtchison will not be made in this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SUMNER.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important, although not the oldest, town established in\r\nAtchison county outside of the city of Atchison was Sumner. A peculiar\r\naroma of legendary glory still clings to this old town, which was\r\nlocated three miles below Atchison, on the Missouri river.\r\n\r\nIts founder was John P. Wheeler, a young man who came to the Territory\r\nwhen about twenty-one years of age, and who has been described as “a\r\nred-headed, blue-eyed, consumptive, slim, freckled enthusiast from\r\nMassachusetts.”\r\n\r\nAtchison at this time was a strong pro-slavery town, and no abolitionist\r\nwas a welcome settler in her midst. For this reason Sumner sprang into\r\nexistence. It was a dream of its founder to make Sumner an important\r\nforwarding point, one of its claims being the fact that it was the most\r\nwesterly of any of the Missouri river towns in Kansas.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 the site was surveyed and platted, and the name “Sumner” given\r\nthe new town, in honor of George Sumner, one of the original\r\nstockholders, and not for his brother, the Hon. Charles Sumner, United\r\nStates senator, of Massachusetts, as many people suppose.\r\n\r\nTo bring Sumner before the public Mr. Wheeler engaged an artist named\r\nAlbert Conant to come out and make a drawing of it, and this was later\r\ntaken to Cincinnati, and a colored lithograph made from it, which was\r\nwidely circulated. From copies of this lithograph still extant it must\r\nbe admitted that the artist did not slight the town in any particular.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1857 the Sumner Town Company began the erection of a\r\nlarge brick hotel. Samuel Hollister had the contract, his bid being\r\n$16,000. The brick used in the construction were made on the ground, and\r\nthe lumber used in the construction work came by steamboat from\r\nPittsburgh, Pa. The hotel was completed in the summer of 1858, and at\r\nlast accounts the town company still owed Mr. Hollister $3,000. Some\r\nyears later the brick used in the hotel were gathered and cleaned and\r\nhauled to Atchison and used for the construction of a building owned by\r\nthe late John J. Ingalls, located at 108–110 South Fourth street.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1857 Cone Brothers (John P. and D. D.) brought a printing\r\noutfit to Kansas, and were induced to locate in Sumner, where they\r\nshortly begun the publication of _The Sumner Gazette_, the first issue\r\nof which appeared on September 12. During the political canvass that\r\nfall they also issued a daily. _The Gazette_ was issued until 1861 when\r\nit suspended, its publishers believing that it was the only paper in\r\nKansas that outlived the town in which it started.\r\n\r\nAmong those engaged in business in Sumner on October 1, 1857, the _Daily\r\nGazette_ shows the following:\r\n\r\nJohn P. Wheeler, attorney and counsellor at law, commissioner of deeds,\r\ndealer in real estate, etc.\r\n\r\nKahn & Fassler, general store, on Front street, between Washington\r\navenue and Chestnut street.\r\n\r\nMayer & Rohrmann, carpenters and builders.\r\n\r\nBarnard & Wheeler, proprietors of the Sumner Brick Yard.\r\n\r\nWm. M. Reed, contractor, Atchison and Sumner.\r\n\r\nJohn Armor, steam saw mill, in the city.\r\n\r\nButcher & Brothers, general store on Front street, between Washington\r\navenue and Olive street.\r\n\r\nAllen Green, painter and glazier.\r\n\r\nS. J. Bennett, boot and shoe store, corner of Washington avenue and\r\nFourth street.\r\n\r\nArthur M. Claflin, general land agent, forwarding and commission agent.\r\n\r\nJ. P. Wheeler and A. M. Claflin, lumber, office with the Sumner Company.\r\n\r\nH. S. Baker, proprietor of Baker’s Hotel, corner of Front and Olive\r\nstreets, near steamboat landing.\r\n\r\nA. Barber, general merchandise, Front street, between Washington avenue\r\nand Olive street.\r\n\r\nLietzenburger & Co., blacksmiths, wagon makers, etc., Cedar street,\r\nbetween Third and Fourth streets.\r\n\r\nD. Newcomb. M. D., office in postoffice building, corner of Third street\r\nand Washington avenue. Mr. Newcomb also dealt in lime, and on September\r\n24, received a large and select stock of hardware, stoves, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen the Territorial legislature of 1858 met, a bill was introduced,\r\nincorporating the Sumner Company, Cyrus F. Currier, Samuel F. Harsh, J.\r\nW. Morris, Isaac G. Losse and John P. Wheeler, their associates and\r\nsuccessors, constituting the company. The act also provided that the\r\ncorporation should have the power to purchase and hold, and enter by\r\npreëmption and otherwise, any quantity of land where the town of Sumner\r\nis now located, not to exceed one thousand acres, etc.\r\n\r\nA ferry at Sumner was also incorporated by the legislature of 1858, J.\r\nW. Morris, Cyrus F. Currier and Samuel Harsh being the incorporators.\r\nThis boat plied between Atchison and Sumner and the Missouri side.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 Samuel Hollister built a steam sawmill, adding a gristmill\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1858 Sumner had outstripped its rival, Atchison, in\r\npopulation, and steps were taken looking towards the incorporation of\r\nthe town. Early in the beginning of the legislature of 1859, articles of\r\nincorporation were passed and received the approval of Governor Samuel\r\nMedary on February 9. These articles of incorporation were later amended\r\nby an act passed by the first State legislature, which was approved June\r\n3, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe decline of Sumner began with the drought which started in the fall\r\nof 1859 and prevailed through the year 1860. In June, 1860, a cyclone\r\nstruck the town and either blew down or damaged nearly every building,\r\nthis calamity being followed in September by a visitation of\r\ngrasshoppers, all of which were potent factors in wiping Sumner off the\r\nmap. Some of the houses which could be moved were taken to Atchison, and\r\nsome to farms in the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting accounts that appeared about Sumner was\r\nwritten by H. Clay Park, an old citizen of Atchison, who for many years\r\nwas editor and part owner of the _Atchison Patriot_. It would not be\r\njust either to Mr. Park or to Sumner, were this account not perpetuated\r\nin this volume, and it, therefore, appears in full as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                     “THE RISE AND FALL OF SUMNER.\r\n\r\n“Three miles south of Atchison, Kansas, is the site of a dead city,\r\nwhose streets once were filled with the clamor of busy traffic and\r\nechoed to the tread of thousands of oxen and mules that in the pioneer\r\ndays of the Great West transported the products of the East across the\r\nGreat American Desert to the Rocky mountains. It was a city in which for\r\na few years twenty-five hundred men and women and children lived and\r\nlabored and loved, in which many lofty aspirations were born, and in\r\nwhich several young men began careers that became historical.\r\n\r\n“This city was located on what the early French voyagers called the\r\n‘Grand Detour’ of the Missouri river. No more rugged and picturesque\r\nsite for a city or one more inaccessible and with more unpropitious\r\nenvironments could have been selected. It was literally built in and on\r\nthe everlasting hills, covered with a primeval forest so dense that the\r\nshadows chased the sunbeams away. It sprang into existence so suddenly\r\nand imperceptibly it might almost have been considered a creation of the\r\nmagician’s wand. It was named Sumner in honor of the great Massachusetts\r\nsenator. Its official motto was ‘Pro lege et grege’ (For the law and the\r\npeople). This would, in the light of subsequent events, have been more\r\nsuggestive: ‘I shall fall, like a bright exhalation in the evening.’\r\n\r\n“Sumner’s first citizens came mostly from Massachusetts, and were imbued\r\nwith the spirit of creed and cant, self-reliance and fanaticism that\r\ncould have been born only on Plymouth Rock. They had come to the\r\nfrontier to make Kansas a free State and to build a city, within whose\r\nwalls all previous conditions of slavery should be disregarded and where\r\nall men born should be regarded equal. The time—1856—was auspicious.\r\nKansas was both a great political and military battlefield, upon which\r\nthe question of the institution of slavery was to be settled for all\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“The growth of Sumner was phenomenal. A lithograph printed in 1857 shows\r\nstreets of stately buildings, imposing seats of learning, church spires\r\nthat pierced the clouds, elegant hotels and theaters, the river full of\r\nfloating palaces, its levee lined with bales and barrels of merchandise,\r\nand the white smoke from numerous factories hanging over the city like a\r\nbanner of peace and prosperity. To one who in that day approached Sumner\r\nfrom the east and saw it across the river, which like a burnished\r\nmirror, reflected its glories, it did indeed present an imposing aspect.\r\n\r\n“One day the steamboat Duncan S. Carter landed at Sumner. On its\r\nhurricane deck was John J. Ingalls, then only twenty-four years old. As\r\nhis eye swept the horizon his prophetic soul uttered these words:\r\n‘Behold the home of the future senator from Kansas.’ Here the young\r\ncollege graduate, who since that day became the senator from Kansas,\r\nlived and dreamed until Sumner’s star had set and Atchison’s sun had\r\nrisen, and then he moved to Atchison, bringing with him Sumner’s\r\nofficial seal and the key to his hotel.\r\n\r\n“Here lived that afterwards brilliant author and journalist, Albert D.\r\nRichardson, whose tragic death some years ago in the counting room of\r\nthe _New York Tribune_ is well remembered. His ‘Beyond the Mississippi’\r\nis to this day the most fascinating account ever written of the\r\nboundless West.\r\n\r\n“Here lived the nine-year-old Minnie Hauk, who was one day to become a\r\nrenowned prima donna and charm two continents with her voice, and who\r\nwas to wed the Count Wartegg. Minnie was born in poverty and cradled in\r\nadversity. Her mother was a poor washerwoman in Sumner.\r\n\r\n“Here lived John E. Remsburg, the now noted author, lecturer and free-\r\nthinker. Mr. Remsburg has probably delivered more lectures in the last\r\nthirty years than any man in America. He is now the leader of the Free-\r\nThought Federation of America.\r\n\r\n“Here Walter A. Wood, the big manufacturer of agricultural implements,\r\nlived and made and mended wagons. Here Lovejoy, ‘the Yankee preacher,’\r\npreached and prayed. Here lived ‘Brother’ and ‘Sister’ Newcomb, from\r\nwhom has descended a long line of zealous and eminent Methodists. Here\r\nwas born Paul Hull, the well known Chicago journalist.\r\n\r\n“And Sumner was the city that the Rev. Pardee Butler lifted up his hands\r\nand blessed and prophesied would grow and wax fat when the ‘upper\r\nlanding’ would sleep in a dishonored and forgotten grave, as he floated\r\nby it on his raft, clad in tar and feathers. The ‘upper landing’ was the\r\nopprobrious title conferred by Sumner upon Atchison. The two towns were\r\nbitter enemies. Sumner was ‘abolitionist;’ Atchison was ‘border\r\nruffian.’ In Atchison the ‘nigger’ was a slave; in Sumner he was a\r\nfetich. It was in Atchison that the ‘abolition preacher,’ Pardee Butler,\r\nwas tarred and feathered and set adrift on a raft in the river. He\r\nsurvived the tortures of his coat of degradation and the ‘chuck-holes’\r\nof the Missouri river and lived to become a prohibition fanatic and a\r\nDemocratic Presidential elector.\r\n\r\n“Jonathan Lang, alias ‘Shang,’ the hero of Senator Ingalls’ ‘Catfish\r\nAristocracy,’ and the ‘last mayor of Sumner,’ lived and died in Sumner.\r\nWhen all his lovely companions had faded and gone ‘Shang’ still pined on\r\nthe stem. The senator’s description of this type of a vanished race is\r\nunique:\r\n\r\n“‘To the most minute observer his age was a question of the gravest\r\ndoubt. He might have been thirty; he might have been a century, with no\r\nviolation of the probabilities. His hair was a sandy sorrel, something\r\nlike a Rembrandt interior, and strayed around his freckled scalp like\r\nthe top layer of a hayrick in a tornado. His eyes were two ulcers, half\r\nfilled with pale blue starch. A thin, sharp nose projected above a\r\nlipless mouth that seemed always upon the point of breaking into the\r\nmost grievous lamentations, and never opened save to take whiskey and\r\ntobacco in and let oaths and saliva out. A long, slender neck, yellow\r\nand wrinkled after the manner of a lizard’s belly, bore this dome of\r\nthought upon its summit, itself projecting from a miscellaneous\r\nassortment of gent’s furnishing goods, which covered a frame of\r\nunearthly longitude and unspeakable emaciation. Thorns and thongs\r\nsupplied the place of buttons upon the costume of this Brummel of the\r\nbottom, coarsely patched beyond recognition of the original fabric. The\r\ncoat had been constructed for a giant, the pants for a pigmy. They were\r\ntoo long in the waist and too short in the leg, and flapped loosely\r\naround his shrunk shanks high above the point where his fearful feet\r\nwere partially concealed by mismated shoes that permitted his great toes\r\nto peer from their gaping integuments, like the heads of two snakes of a\r\nnovel species and uncommon fetor. This princely phenomenon was topped\r\nwith a hat which had neither band nor brim nor crown:\r\n\r\n“‘If that could shape be called which shape has none.\r\n\r\n“‘His voice was high, shrill and querulous, and his manner an odd\r\nmixture of fawning servility and apprehensive effrontery at the sight of\r\na “damned Yankee abolitionist,” whom he hated and feared next to a negro\r\nwho was not a slave.’\r\n\r\n“The only error in the senator’s description of ‘Shang’ is that ‘Shang’\r\nwas ‘abolitionist’ himself, and ‘fit to free the nigger.’\r\n\r\n‘Shang’ continued to live in Sumner until every house, save his\r\nmiserable hut, had vanished like the baseless fabric of a vision. He\r\nclaimed and was proud of the title, ‘the last mayor of Sumner.’ He died\r\na few years ago, and a little later lightning struck his cabin and it\r\nwas devoured by flames. And thus passed away the last relic of Sumner.\r\n\r\n“In the flood tide of Sumner’s prosperity, 1856 to 1859—for before that\r\nit was nothing, after that nothing—it had ambition to become the county\r\nseat of the newly organized county of Atchison. J. P. Wheeler, president\r\nof the Sumner Town Company, was a member of the lower house of the\r\nTerritorial legislature, and he ‘logrolled’ a bill through that body\r\nconferring upon Sumner the title of county seat, but the Atchison ‘gang’\r\nfinally succeeded in getting the bill killed in the senate.\r\nSubsequently, October, 1858, there was an election to settle the vexed\r\nquestion of a county seat. Atchison won; Sumner lost.\r\n\r\n“About this time Atchison secured its first railroad. The smoke from the\r\nlocomotive engines drifted to Sumner and enveloped it like a pall. The\r\ndecadence was at hand, and Sumner’s race to extinction and oblivion was\r\nrapid. One day there was an exodus of citizens; the houses were torn\r\ndown and the timbers thereof carted away, and foundation stones were dug\r\nup and carried hence. Successive summers’ rains and winters’ snows\r\nfurrowed streets and alleys beyond recognition and filled foundation\r\nexcavations to the level, and ere long a tangled mass of briers and\r\nbrambles hid away the last vestige of the once busy, ambitious city. The\r\nforest, again unvexed by ax or saw, asserted his dominion once more, and\r\ntoday, beneath the shadow cast by mighty oaks and sighing cottonwoods,\r\nSumner lies dead and forgotten.”\r\n\r\nIn the above article, reference is made by Mr. Park to Jonathan Lang,\r\nand it is important in this connection to print herewith an excerpt from\r\nthe _Atchison Daily Globe_, December, 1915, relating to this interesting\r\ncharacter, which follows:\r\n\r\n“The reunion of the Thirteenth Kansas infantry at Hiawatha Tuesday\r\nrecalls that the late Jonathan G. Lang, self-styled ‘Mayor of Old\r\nSumner,’ and hero of John J. Ingalls’ ‘Catfish Aristocracy,’ was a\r\nsoldier in this regiment, and was the butt of many jokes on the part of\r\nhis comrades in camp as he was in the days of civil life at old Sumner.\r\nThomas J. Payne, a sergeant in the Thirteenth, now living in California,\r\nrelates an amusing story of ‘Old Shang,’ as Lang was generally called by\r\nhis comrades: When the regiment was mustered into service on September\r\n28, 1862, and the newly assigned officers were reviewing their troops at\r\nCamp Stanton, in Atchison, the tall, gaunt form of Lang (for he was\r\nnearly seven feet tall and very angular) towered above the rest of the\r\nmen like the stately cottonwood above the hazel-brush. Riding up and\r\ndown the lines, and scanning the troops with critical eye to see that\r\nthere was no breech of ranks or decorum, the gaze of Colonel Bowen could\r\nnot help but fall upon the lofty and lanky form of Lang, rising several\r\nheads above any of his comrades. The colonel paused, and pointing his\r\nfinger at the grenadier form in the ranks, shouted in thunderous tones,\r\n‘Get down off that stump.’ A ripple of suppressed laughter immediately\r\npassed along the lines, and when Colonel Bowen saw his mistake he\r\npromptly revoked his order with a hearty chuckle and rode on towards the\r\nend of the column. And not until twenty years later, when all that was\r\nmortal of old Lang—his nearly seven feet of skin and bones—was laid way\r\nto moulder with the ruins of old Sumner, did he finally ‘get down off of\r\nthat stump.’ He rests at the entrance of the Sumner cemetery and his\r\ngrave is marked with one of those small, regulation slabs such as are\r\nfurnished by the Government for the graves of dead soldiers and bears\r\nthis simple inscription: ‘J. G. Lang, Co. K. 13th Kansas Infantry.’\r\nThere are two other members of the Thirteenth Kansas buried at Sumner.\r\nThey are, John Scott, of Company D, and Albred Brown, of Company F.”\r\n\r\nAnother article relating to Old Sumner, which is entertaining and\r\ninstructive, was written by E. W. Howe, and is taken from the Historical\r\nEdition of the _Atchison Daily Globe_, issued July 16, 1894:\r\n\r\n“The founder of Sumner was John P. Wheeler, a red-headed, blue-eyed,\r\nconsumptive, slim, freckled enthusiast from Massachusetts. He was a\r\nsurveyor by profession, and also founded the town of Hiawatha. He was\r\none of the adventurers who came to Kansas as a result of the excitement\r\nof 1855–’56, and was only twenty-one years old when he came West. Most\r\nof the men who had much to do with early Kansas history were young.\r\n\r\n“The town was not named for Charles Sumner, as is generally supposed,\r\nbut for his brother, George Sumner, one of the original stockholders. At\r\nthat time Atchison was controlled by Southern sympathizers—P. T. Abell,\r\nthe Stringfellows, the McVeys, A. J. Westbrook and others—and\r\nabolitionists were not welcome in the town. It was believed that a city\r\nwould be built within a few miles of this point, as it was favorable for\r\noverland freighting, being farther West than any other point on the\r\nMissouri river. On the old French maps Atchison was known as the ‘Grand\r\nDetour,’ meaning the great bend in the river to the westward.\r\n\r\n“Being a violent abolitionist, John P. Wheeler determined to establish a\r\ntown where abolitionists would be welcome, and Sumner was the result.\r\nThe town was laid out in 1856, and the next year Wheeler had a\r\nlithograph made, which he took East for use in booming his town.\r\n\r\n“Among others captured by means of this lithograph was John J. Ingalls.\r\nWheeler and Ingalls were both acquainted with a Boston man of means\r\nnamed Samuel A. Walker. Wheeler wanted Walker to invest in Sumner, and\r\nas Walker knew that Ingalls was anxious to go West, he asked him to stop\r\nat Sumner and report upon it as a point for the investment of Boston\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ingalls arrived in Sumner on the 4th of October, 1858, on the\r\nsteamer Duncan S. Carter, which left St. Louis four days before. The\r\ntown then contained about two thousand people, five hundred more than\r\nAtchison; but Sumner was already declining, and Mr. Ingalls did not\r\nadvise his friend, Walker, to invest.\r\n\r\n“A hotel building costing $16,000.00, had been built by Samuel\r\nHollister. A famous steamboat cook had charge of the kitchen in the old\r\ndays, and the stages running between Jefferson City and St. Joe stopped\r\nthere every day for dinner. Jefferson City was then the end of the\r\nrailroad—the Pacific Railroad of Missouri, now the Missouri Pacific—\r\nwhich runs through the deserted site of Sumner, and directly over the\r\nfoundation of the wagon factory built by Levi A. Woods. This wagon\r\nfactory was one of the results of Wheeler’s audacious lithograph, and\r\nfew wagons were actually manufactured. The factory was heavily insured,\r\nand burned.\r\n\r\n“Albert R. Richardson was a citizen of Sumner, when Mr. Ingalls arrived\r\nthere; also James Hauk, the father of Minnie Hauk, who has since become\r\nfamous as a singer in grand opera. James Hauk was a carpenter, whose\r\nwife operated a boarding house. Minnie Hauk waited on the table, and was\r\nnoted among the boarders as a smart little girl with a long yellow braid\r\ndown her back, who could play the piano pretty well. The next year Hauk\r\nmade a house boat and floated down the river to New Orleans.\r\n\r\n“When John J. Ingalls went to Sumner, a young man of twenty-four, he\r\ntook great interest in such characters as Archie Boler and Jonathan\r\nGrander Lang. Lang was a jug fisherman in the river, melon raiser, truck\r\npatch farmer and town drunkard. Ingalls says that Lang was really a\r\nbright fellow. He had been a dragoon in the Mexican War, and his stories\r\nof experiences in the West were intensely interesting. Ingalls used to\r\ngo out in Lang’s boat when he was jugging for catfish and spend hours\r\nlistening to his talk. Finally Ingalls wrote his ‘Catfish Aristocracy,’\r\nand Lang recognized himself as the hero. He was very indignant and\r\nthreatened to sue Ingalls, having been advised by some jackleg lawyer\r\nthat the article was libelous. Lang lived on a piece of land belonging\r\nto Ingalls at the time, and Ingalls told the writer of this the other\r\nday that it was actually true that he settled with Lang for a sack of\r\nflour and a side of bacon. Lang served in the Civil war, and long after\r\nits close, when his old friend was president of the United States\r\nSenate, he secured him a pension and a lot of back pay. But this he\r\nsquandered in marrying. His pension money was a curse to him, for it\r\nonly served to put a lot of wolves on his trail.\r\n\r\n“When the war broke out the Atchison men who objected to abolitionists\r\nsettling in their town were driven out of the country, and this\r\nattracted a good many of the citizens of Sumner. But its death blow came\r\nin June, 1860, when nearly every house in the place was either blown\r\ndown or badly damaged by a tornado. This was the first and only tornado\r\nin the history of this immediate section.”\r\n\r\nReference is made in both of these articles to John J. Ingalls, who\r\narrived in Sumner from Boston, Mass., October 4, 1858. Mr. Ingalls was a\r\ngraduate of Williams College a short time before, and at the time he\r\ndecided to go West he was a student in a law office in Boston, where his\r\nattention was first called to Sumner by an elaborate lithograph of the\r\ntown displayed by Mr. Wheeler, the promoter. The impressions of Mr.\r\nIngalls upon his arrival in Sumner are, therefore, pertinent and convey\r\nsome idea of the shock he received when he landed at the Sumner levee.\r\nIn a letter which he subsequently wrote describing the event, he said:\r\n\r\n“That chromatic triumph of lithographed mendacity, supplemented by the\r\nloquacious embellishments of a lively adventurer who has been laying out\r\ntown sites and staking off corner lots for some years past in Tophet,\r\nexhibited a scene in which the attractions of art, nature, science,\r\ncommerce and religion were artistically blended. Innumerable drays were\r\ntransporting from a fleet of gorgeous steamboats vast cargoes of foreign\r\nand domestic merchandise over Russ pavements to colossal warehouses of\r\nbrick and stone. Dense, wide streets of elegant residences rose with\r\ngentle ascent from the stores of the tranquil stream. Numerous parks,\r\ndecorated with rare trees, shrubbery and fountains were surrounded with\r\nthe mansions of the great and the temples of their devotion. The\r\nadjacent eminences were crowned with costly piles which wealth, directed\r\nby intelligence and controlled by taste, had erected for the education\r\nof the rising generation of Sumnerites. The only shadow upon the\r\nenchanting landscape fell from the clouds of smoke that poured from the\r\ntowering shafts of her acres of manufactories, while the whole\r\ncircumference of the undulating prairie was white with endless, sinuous\r\ntrains of wagons, slowly moving toward the mysterious region of the\r\nFarther West.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 OCENA.\r\n\r\nOcena was laid out in Atchison county in 1855, and for a time it gave\r\npromise of becoming an important place. Ocena was located on the\r\nnortheast bank of Stranger creek, on what is known as the McBride farm,\r\nin the south half of the northeast quarter of section 22, township 6,\r\nrange 19, about a mile north of the present site of Pardee. The first\r\npostoffice in Center township, and one of the first in Atchison county,\r\nwas established at Ocena with William Crosby as postmaster in August,\r\n1855. In 1856, T. C. McBride was appointed postmaster, and served until\r\nthe office was removed to Pardee in 1858, when S. G. Moore was appointed\r\npostmaster.\r\n\r\nT. C. McBride was one of the early settlers of Center township, having\r\narrived there in March, 1856, and settled on the land on which the town\r\nof Ocena was built. He was one of the early merchants of the place,\r\nhaving a small store, in which he kept the postoffice. The mail was\r\ncarried from Atchison to Ocena by stage. McBride was a Tennesseean, born\r\nin 1826. In the fall of 1857, in a grove on the McBride farm, the first\r\nchurch service in that section was held. It was of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal denomination.\r\n\r\nOcena was the first important stopping place west of Atchison. The old\r\n_Squatter Sovereign_, of Atchison, in its issue of December 5, 1857,\r\ncontained the following advertisement of the town: “The truth plainly\r\ntold will show that Ocena is already a city. The surface of the earth\r\nwas so moulded by the plastic hand of the Creator that a few points in\r\nthe wide expanse of Nature were destined to eclipse all others. Ocena is\r\none of those points. Located as it is, on the northeast bank of Stranger\r\ncreek, in the county of Atchison, where roads leading from Doniphan and\r\nSt. Joe to Lecompton are intersected by roads leading from Atchison to\r\nGrasshopper Falls and Osawkee; and also being upon the great\r\nthoroughfare running up and down the valley of the Stranger, it offers\r\nmore inducements for a large and prosperous inland town than any other\r\nplace in Kansas Territory. All persons anxious to thrive and desirous of\r\nobtaining a home on reasonable terms will do well to settle in Ocena.\r\nFor further particulars in reference to the town apply to Isaac S.\r\nHascall, president, or M. C. Finney, secretary.”\r\n\r\n_Freedom’s Champion_, in its issue of July 3, 1858, says of the town:\r\n“Ocena, besides having the most musical name, is one of the most\r\nbeautiful places in Kansas. A postoffice has been established there and\r\nseveral new buildings are being erected. It is destined to be a thriving\r\nlittle place.”\r\n\r\nOcena was killed by Pardee, a town which was started a short distance to\r\nthe south of it, but neither amounted to much from a municipal and\r\nbusiness standpoint. Pardee is now only a country village. It was first\r\nplatted as a town by James Brewer, in the string of 1857, and was named\r\nin honor of Pardee Butler, of border warfare fame. In the winter of 1856\r\nMr. Butler preached his first sermon in Pardee, the services being held\r\nin the school house, which had been completed during the previous fall,\r\nand opened by James Brewer in December. Caleb May, the first settler in\r\nCenter township, was the first president of the Pardee Town Company.\r\nPardee Butler was afterwards president; Milo Carleton, secretary; Wm. J.\r\nMay, treasurer; S. G. Moore, A. Elliott and W. Wakefield, trustees. Mr.\r\nMoore opened the first store in Pardee in 1858, and became the first\r\npostmaster as aforestated. Mr. Carleton put a wind gristmill in\r\noperation at Pardee at an early day, but it was destroyed by a storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LANCASTER.\r\n\r\nLancaster is one of the oldest towns in the county. In the issue of\r\nOctober 16, 1858, of _Freedom’s Champion_, the following advertisement\r\nwith reference to Lancaster appears:\r\n\r\n                              “LANCASTER.\r\n\r\n“Lancaster City is the name of a new town just springing into existence.\r\nIt is located 10 miles direct west of our city (Atchison) Atchison\r\ncounty, K. T., on the east half of Section 32, Township 5, Range 19, the\r\ngreat military road to Fts. Kearney, Laramie, Bridge, and to Santa Fe,\r\nUtah, Washington Territory, Gadson Purchase, California, New Mexico,\r\netc., passes through the town site. Also roads leading from Nebraska\r\nCity, St. Joseph, Doniphan, and to Grasshopper Falls, Topeka, Lecompton\r\nand Lawrence.\r\n\r\n“A more beautiful situation for a large and prosperous city could not be\r\nfound in the Territory, or the Great West. Its site is rolling and dry,\r\nclimate healthy and salubrious as heart could wish for. The surrounding\r\ncountry cannot be surpassed for its magnificent undulating prairies,\r\nbeing one of the most fertile agricultural regions in the whole country.\r\n\r\n“Excellent coal, building stone and timber, within two, and two and a\r\nhalf miles. This town has been under way but little over two months, and\r\nnotwithstanding the hard times, quite a number of buildings are already\r\nerected, among which will be found a large and commodious hotel, a good\r\nstore, blacksmith and carpenter shops, post office, etc., etc.\r\nArrangements are made for the erection of several more dwelling houses,\r\nalso for the erection during this month, of a Union church, (the first\r\nin the county) and with liberty heretofore unequalled in Kansas, Mr. J.\r\nW. Smith, the President of the Company, authorizes us to say that he\r\nwill give good lots gratis to mechanics, laborers, and others, who will\r\napply for them soon, or who will erect improvements on them in six\r\nmonths, worth $200 or more. This, we think, a good chance for men who\r\nwant a comfortable home in the best section of our country. The company\r\nnow offer to sell lots or shares at reasonable rates, and are prepared\r\nto make warrantee deeds for the same, having purchased the site and\r\nobtained the title for the same of the Government of the United States\r\non the 26th day of June, 1858. Persons wishing to live in an interior\r\ntown, will do well to visit Lancaster before investing elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nWhile this little town did not prove to be all that its promoters\r\nexpected of it, it continued as a good trading point for many years, and\r\nin 1916 remains one of the prosperous communities of the county. In\r\naddition to the one bank which it supports, reference to which has\r\nalready been made, Lancaster, in 1915, has seven stores, a two-room\r\npublic school, three churches, one elevator, one lumber yard, a good\r\nhotel and a garage. In 1915 its enterprising citizens built an electric\r\nhigh tensioned line connecting with the Effingham line out of Atchison,\r\nto supply the town with electric lights, and its citizens are now\r\nenjoying all the benefits of electricity.\r\n\r\nAbout 80,000 bushels of grain, and an average of seventy-five cars of\r\nlive stock are shipped out of Lancaster annually. Its merchants are\r\nenterprising and prosperous, and many comfortable and commodious homes\r\nhave been built in this little town. It is located in one of the finest\r\nagricultural sections of the county, and the surrounding country is in a\r\nstate of high cultivation, and peopled by prosperous and thrifty\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PORT WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nIn the _Squatter Sovereign_ of March 11, 1856, published at Atchison,\r\nappeared the following advertisement of Port William:\r\n\r\n“This new and beautiful town site is situated on the Missouri river, in\r\nKansas Territory, three or four miles above the town of Iatan, in the\r\nheart of the most densely populated part of Kansas; surrounded by the\r\nfinest soil and timber in that Territory, with a permanent landing,\r\ncommanding a view of the river for several miles above and below. The\r\nprincipal part of said town is located on a bed of stone coal of the\r\nbest quality. Arrangements are being made to have said stone coal bed\r\nopened and wrought by a joint stock company early in the spring, at\r\nwhich time there will be a sale of lots. There is now in course of\r\nerection a good steam saw mill, which will be in successful operation in\r\na few weeks; also, a large and commodious tavern is in process of\r\nerection, which will be opened for the accommodation of the public in a\r\nshort time. Persons wishing to procure lots immediately will have\r\nopportunity of so doing by calling on Henry Bradley or Jonathan Hartman,\r\nboth of whom are authorized agents to sell and dispose of lots, and one\r\nor both may at all times be found on the premises ready to accommodate\r\npurchasers upon the most liberal terms. H. B. Wallace, Amos Rees, Henry\r\nDebard, H. C. Bradley, H. B. Herndon, James G. Spratt, W. C. Remington,\r\nJames W. Bradley, P. J. Collins, trustees.”\r\n\r\nOf the above named trustees Judge James G. Spratt, W. C. Remington and\r\nHenry Debard were prominent citizens of Platte county, Missouri, and\r\nmembers of the town company that incorporated Port William in 1855.\r\nJames M. and Henry Bradley and H. B. Herndon were also members of this\r\ncompany. Henry Debard was a Kentuckian, born in Clark county, November\r\n24, 1801, and came to Platte county at an early day, later removing to\r\nKansas. He was a prominent Mason, and took an active part in Masonic\r\nwork in Missouri for many years. He was a cabinet maker, but did not\r\nwork much at his trade. He died in Platte City, October 5, 1875.\r\n\r\nAmos Rees was born at Winchester, Va., December 2, 1800, and came to\r\nMissouri at an early age, locating in Platte county, March 1, 1845. For\r\nmany years he was a prominent attorney of that county. He moved to\r\nKansas in 1855, and died, December 29, 1885. Dr. H. B. Wallace, who was\r\ninterested in Port William, was a physician at Platte City, and a member\r\nof the town board in 1858. He invested largely in St. Jose, and the war\r\nreduced him almost to poverty. He died, February 24, 1863. Judge Paxton,\r\nin his “Annals of Platte County,” simply mentions him as having married\r\nthe “beautiful and accomplished Ann E. Owen.”\r\n\r\nJ. Butler Chapman arrived in Kansas in the spring of 1854, made a trip\r\nover the territory, and then published a small volume, entitled “History\r\nof Kansas and Emigrant’s Guide.” He refers to Port William as\r\n“Williamsport, a prospective town a short distance above Kickapoo.” “The\r\nbluffs,” he continues, “are high and precipitous, and the land broken\r\nuntil you reach the high rolling prairie back some three miles. The\r\nwhole country is settled on with a view of preëmption.”\r\n\r\nA company known as the Port William Sharp’s Rifles, numbering eighty-\r\none, rank and file, was formed at Port William, in October, 1856. The\r\ncommissioned officers elected were James Adkins, captain; Henry C.\r\nBradley, first lieutenant; James M. Bradley, second lieutenant; S.\r\nBowman, third lieutenant. The company was enrolled, or was intended to\r\nbe enrolled, in the first regiment, first brigade, northern division of\r\nthe Kansas militia, and applied for arms and commissions. The Port\r\nWilliam Town Company was incorporated by an act of the Territorial\r\nlegislature in 1855 and the town company was composed of William C.\r\nRemington, James G. Spratt, Henry Debard, James M. Bradley, Henry\r\nBradley, Horace B. Herndon and William B. Almond.\r\n\r\nGeneral William B. Almond, one of the incorporators of Pt. William, was\r\na noted man in the West in the early days. He was a Virginian, who came\r\nto Platte county, Missouri, when the Platte Purchase was opened, and\r\nsettled near the Buchanan county line. At a very early period he had\r\nbeen connected with the American Fur Company, and as a mountaineer had\r\nmany adventures. During the thirties he was a brigadier general of the\r\nState militia in Missouri. He was one of the foremost “Forty-niners” to\r\nCalifornia, leading a company to the land of gold, among whom was Ben\r\nHolladay, afterwards famous as the originator of the “pony express” and\r\nother Western enterprises. While in California General Almond\r\ndistinguished himself as a Territorial judge in San Francisco. Returning\r\nto Platte county in 1851 he was elected circuit judge, was a candidate\r\nfor lieutenant governor, and filled other offices and places of\r\ndistinction and prominence. He was also connected with mercantile,\r\nmilling and other enterprises. He lived for some time in Topeka and\r\nLeavenworth, and died at the latter place in 1860.\r\n\r\nJudge James G. Spratt, another of the promoters of old Port William, was\r\nalso a man of some prominence. He came to the West from Smith county,\r\nVirginia, where he was born, 1826, and, like General Almond, settled in\r\nPlatte county at a very early day. In 1843 he was appointed a justice of\r\nthe peace in Platte county, and was afterwards deputy county clerk,\r\nprobate judge and held other positions. For some time he was engaged in\r\nthe practice of law, and was in partnership with Hon. Joseph E.\r\nMerryman, in Platte City. In 1864 he went to Montana where he became a\r\nmine speculator. He died November 13, 1881, and his remains were brought\r\nback to Platte for burial. W. H. Spratt, a brother of Judge Spratt, was\r\nat one time sheriff of Platte county.\r\n\r\nWilliam C. Remington was another pioneer of Platte, like General Almond\r\nand Judge Spratt, a Virginian by birth, who came west at a very early\r\nday. He was one of the early assessors of Platte county, and\r\nsubsequently was elected circuit clerk. He was one of the trustees of\r\nthe Platte City Town Company when it was incorporated in 1843. He was\r\nalso a member of the company that laid off the town of St. Mary’s at the\r\nmouth of Bee creek in 1857, but no lots were ever sold. Mr. Remington\r\nwas one of the early merchants of Platte City, one of the proprietors of\r\nthe _Platte City Weekly Atlas_, and was interested in various other\r\nenterprises. His handsome brick residence in Platte City was among those\r\nburned by federal orders in July, 1864. He died December 20, 1864, in\r\nOmaha, where he was operating a hotel.\r\n\r\nOf Henry Debard, another member of the Port William Town Company, the\r\nwriter has not yet found any record. The Bradleys lived in Platte\r\ncounty, opposite Port William for many years, moved over to the Kansas\r\nside early in 1854, and with Squire Horace B. Herndon started the old\r\ntown. The Bradleys opened a general store and James M. Bradley was\r\nappointed postmaster when the postoffice was established in April, 1855.\r\nSquire Herndon was one of the earliest justices of the peace in Kansas,\r\nand had much business in his court in the early days, as Port William\r\nwas one of the roughest of the border towns.\r\n\r\nPort William was located eight miles below Atchison. It is one of the\r\nmost interesting localities from a historical standpoint in Atchison\r\ncounty and northeastern Kansas. It is one of the oldest settlements in\r\nKansas, and for a time in the early days was one of the promising\r\nvillages of the territory. In fact, it was of enough importance, not in\r\nsize, but as a prospective populace, to be mentioned by travelers of\r\nthat time, as one of the principal towns of Kansas. Father Pierre Jean\r\nde Smet, the Jesuit missionary, in a letter written February 26, 1859,\r\nsays: “A great number of towns and villages have sprung up as if by\r\nenchantment in the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska. The principal\r\ntowns of Kansas are Wyandotte, Delaware, Douglas, Marysville, Iola,\r\nAtchison, Ft. Scott, Pawnee, Lecompton, Neosho, Richmond, Tecumseh,\r\nLawrence, Port William, Doniphan, Paola, Alexandria, Indianola, Easton,\r\nLeavenworth and others.” The history of old Doniphan, Sumner and\r\nKickapoo has long been well established, but that of Port William has\r\nbeen neglected and has remained obscure. Port William never was much of\r\na town, as were its rivals, Doniphan, Sumner and Kickapoo, but it was\r\nproposedly in the race for municipal supremacy in the pioneer days, and\r\nthough its star may never have attained the ascendency, its story is at\r\nleast worthy of preservation in the archives of Atchison county history.\r\n\r\nPort William was started in 1856 by Henry and James M. Bradley, John T.\r\nand Albred Bailey, and Jonathan Hartman. The two Bradleys and John T.\r\nBailey composed the town company. The Bradleys conducted a general\r\nstore, and a postoffice was established in April, 1855, with Henry\r\nBradley as first postmaster. This was the first postoffice in Walnut\r\ntownship. Jonathan Hartman owned and operated a sawmill, the first in\r\nAtchison county, in 1854, and made the first lumber ever sawed in the\r\ncounty. There were several saloons, and later a blacksmith shop, a\r\ncarpenter shop and other small industries were started. It has been\r\nsurmised by someone that Port Williams, as it is sometimes called, was\r\nnamed for a Missouri river steamboat captain named Williams, as\r\nsteamboats often tied up at the place in the early days. There are\r\nothers who believe it was so-called for the late “Uncle Frank” Williams,\r\none of the fathers of the colored settlement which was started in that\r\nvicinity at a later day. The correct name of the place, however, is Port\r\nWilliam, instead of Port Williams, and it is known that it was so named\r\nmore than fifty years ago, or nearly twenty years before “Uncle Frank”\r\nWilliams settled there. The correct origin of the name is probably given\r\nby the late W. J. Bailey, of Atchison, who was one of the very first\r\nsettlers of that vicinity. He said that in 1854 a man named William\r\nJohnson came across from the settlement about Iatan, Mo., and took up\r\nthe claim on which Port William was afterwards built. It was a likely\r\nclaim and Johnson soon had trouble on his hands in holding the property.\r\nSeveral men tried to chase him off with guns, but Johnson managed to\r\nmake such a good defense as to repel them. He stayed in his cabin a\r\nweek, not daring to come out for fear of being shot. He won out and held\r\nthe claim. The other fellows then referred to his cabin as Fort William\r\n(that was his first name). Soon after Jake Yunt, from Missouri,\r\nestablished a hand ferryboat, and by and by steamboats began to land\r\nthere. Then the name was changed to Port William, and this is the proper\r\nname of the place, although on the Missouri Pacific station board now\r\nstanding there it is marked “Port Williams.”\r\n\r\nThere are but few men who came to Atchison county earlier than W. J.\r\nBailey, of Atchison. He crossed the river from Platte county on June 12,\r\n1854, and settled at Port William, and, with the exception of a few\r\nyears’ residence in Colorado, has lived in this county ever since.\r\nLuther Dickerson, who was generally known as the “oldest inhabitant,”\r\ncame here the same month that Mr. Bailey did. When Mr. Bailey first\r\narrived at Port William he built a one room cabin on his claim near that\r\nplace, and to do so was obliged to drag logs with one horse a distance\r\nof a mile and a half. In 1855 he brought his cattle over. He said the\r\ngrass all over this county was ankle deep and afforded fine pasturage.\r\nThere was no town at Atchison then, but Challiss Bros. conducted a store\r\non the river bank, and George Million operated a hand ferryboat. Mr.\r\nBailey worked for Million three years.\r\n\r\n“Those were happy times,” said Mr. Bailey, “we met around among\r\nneighboring cabins and had parties. When we had a fiddle we danced.” For\r\nseveral years Mr. Bailey was with a freighting crew between Ft.\r\nLeavenworth and Ft. Kearney, most of the time as a wagon-master. They\r\ngenerally drove twenty-six wagons with six yoke of oxen to each wagon\r\nand hauled Government supplies. Once they were surrounded by Indians and\r\nwere in imminent danger of being annihilated, when General Harney with a\r\ncompany of troops came to their rescue and chased the red-skins to Ash\r\nHollow, near Ft. Kearney, where a bloody skirmish took place and the\r\nIndians were routed. Speaking of old Port William, Mr. Bailey said:\r\n“Although laid out as an investment, the town was a failure. The little\r\ncreek flowed through the center of the town, dividing the stores and\r\nsaloons from the sawmill, blacksmith shop and carpenter shop. No city\r\ngovernment encased the stream with cement tiling, and the best bridge\r\nthe town ever afforded was built by felling a cottonwood tree across the\r\nstream.” Port William had its “town bullies” and fights were of frequent\r\noccurrence. Mr. Bailey said that the “town bullies” were Dan McLoud,\r\nBill Pates and Bob Gibson. “It was common,” he said, “for farmers to go\r\nto Port William every Saturday afternoon to witness the fights and\r\ndrunks.” On one occasion a man was badly shot up and another jumped into\r\nthe river and swam across. Mr. Bailey said the first election there\r\ncontained 250 ballots, although only sixty people voted. There were two\r\nballot boxes, one controlled by the pro-slavery and the other by the\r\nFree State people. Eight or ten men stood around the balloting places\r\nwith guns, and people voted five or six times, though under different\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThe “village blacksmith” of old Port William, and one of the early\r\njustices of the peace of Walnut township, was Thomas J. Payne, later\r\nliving at Canyon City, Colo. Mr. Payne settled at Port William, March\r\n18, 1855, and was one of the pioneer blacksmiths of Kansas. He operated\r\nblacksmith shops at three of the old towns of Atchison county, Port\r\nWilliam, Sumner and Mt. Pleasant. He was appointed a justice of the\r\npeace by Governor Shannon, in 1856. The office of “county squire” was of\r\nmore importance in those stirring times than it is now. Mr. Payne’s son,\r\nCharles Sumner Payne, was the first child born at old Sumner. His birth\r\noccurred September 25, 1857. He was named by the town company, who made\r\nout and presented to him a deed for a lot in the once thriving city.\r\nAnother son was born at Sumner on the day that John Brown was hanged,\r\nand was named for the great abolitionist. A third son was named for Jim\r\nLane. Thomas J. Payne enlisted as a private in Company F, Thirteenth\r\nKansas infantry, at Atchison, August 20, 1862, and was later promoted to\r\norderly sergeant. He was discharged at Ft. Smith, Ark., October 29,\r\n1864. Then he was immediately appointed by the secretary of war first\r\nlieutenant of Company B, First Regiment of Kansas infantry, colored. He\r\ntook part in many engagements, and was mustered out in August, 1865. He\r\nwas born in Georgetown, Ohio, the town in which General Grant was born.\r\nThere are few men in Kansas who have served as a justice of the peace\r\nlonger than Mr. Payne. He held the office in Atchison county for a\r\nnumber of years, at Robinson, Kan., for eighteen years, and later at\r\nHorton, Kan., for several years.\r\n\r\nThe old Horace B. Herndon farm at Port William, now owned and occupied\r\nby Frank Bluma, Sr., was known as the “Old Indian farm,” in the early\r\ndays. According to W. J. Bailey it was so-called because an Indian known\r\nas “Kickapoo John” located on it previous to the settlement of Kansas by\r\nthe whites and was still living there with numerous other Indians when\r\nMr. Bailey first came to that locality. Mr. Bailey said that the butts\r\nof tepee poles could be seen sticking in the ground on the site of Port\r\nWilliam for some time afterwards. In 1854 Horace B. Herndon preëmpted\r\nthe “Old Indian farm,” built a cabin thereon at the southwest corner of\r\nthe field near the creek, and put an old negro slave in it to hold the\r\nclaim for him. The old darkey died and was buried in the family burying\r\nground on the farm about 1855. He was probably the first colored man who\r\never lived and died in what afterwards became famous as the “Port\r\nWilliam colored settlement.” This was about twenty years before this\r\ncommunity became generally settled by colored people. The old Herndon\r\nfamily residence, one of the landmarks of this region, is still standing\r\nand is occupied by Frank Bluma and family. There is evidence that the\r\n“old Indian farm” was occupied by Indians long before “Kickapoo John’s”\r\ntime for the old field is strewn with various fragments representing the\r\nstone age and prehistoric times. Mr. Herndon died a number of years ago.\r\nHe was another of the early justices of the peace of Walnut township and\r\nwas generally known as “Squire” Herndon. He was also a public\r\nadministrator for Atchison county, and was one of the most prominent\r\ncitizens of the southern part of the county for many years. He was the\r\nfather of Mrs. Henry King and James Herndon, residents of Round Prairie.\r\nMrs. King, then Miss Virginia Herndon, was the “belle” of the old town\r\nof Port William, and was a social favorite throughout this section of\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nAnother early settler of Port William was Henry Luth, the veteran\r\ncarpenter, who moved from Atchison to Leavenworth. Mr. Luth lived in\r\nPort William for several years in the early fifties, removing to\r\nAtchison in 1857. He built many of the first houses in this section of\r\nthe country. A large walnut cupboard and other furniture in Mr. Luth’s\r\nhome he made from walnut timber cut at Port William and sawed into\r\nlumber at the old Hartman sawmill at that place. Mr. Luth had a little\r\nshop at Port William in which he made furniture. Henry Hausner,\r\nAtchison’s well known commission merchant, took a claim at Port William\r\nin 1855, but was cheated out of it. Andy Brown, for many years an\r\nAtchison flagman, was an early settler of Port William. With Thomas\r\nTaylor, now living at Perry, Kan., he crossed the river to Kansas on\r\nJake Yunt’s ferry just above Port William in 1854. Mr. Brown’s father\r\nhad taken a claim at Port William and Taylor one adjoining it. The\r\nlatter helped Samuel Dickson build his cabin shanty on the site of\r\nAtchison in the fall of 1854.\r\n\r\nEx-Sheriff Fred Hartman, of this county, now deceased, lived at Port\r\nWilliam in the early days. His father, Jonathan Hartman, in 1854, put\r\ninto operation at that place one of the very first sawmills in the\r\nTerritory. It furnished lumber for many of the first houses in this\r\nsection. The lumber was sawed from the fine timber which grew along\r\nLittle Walnut creek. Fred Hartman said that in 1856 Bob Gibson brought\r\nhis famous “Kickapoo Rangers” to Port William for the purpose of\r\nlynching his father, Jonathan Hartman, on account of his most avowed\r\nFree Soil principles. They stayed around a while, and as Mr. Hartman did\r\nnot seem to be the least bit intimidated, they finally left and never\r\nmolested him again. It was during this time that Pardee Butler was\r\nplaced on a raft at Atchison and set adrift in the river. He landed just\r\nabove Port William, and went at once to Mr. Hartman’s for assistance.\r\nNot deeming it safe for Mr. Butler to remain in Port William, Mr.\r\nHartman took him out to the home of Jasper Oliphant, about two miles\r\nwest of the village, where he stayed at night and finally reached his\r\nhome in safety. Jasper Oliphant was another of the earliest settlers of\r\nthis locality. He was assassinated some years ago by Bob Scruggs, a\r\ndesperate character, who at the same time shot and killed John Groff,\r\nanother prominent Walnut township citizen, and Scruggs was captured and\r\nhanged to a tree near Oak Mills. The tragic deaths of two such\r\nsubstantial citizens as Mr. Oliphant and Mr. Groff produced a profound\r\nsensation throughout Walnut township. In the spring of 1857 Jonathan\r\nHartman sold his sawmill and moved to a farm near the present site of\r\nParnell, where he died. Fred Hartman served during the war in the\r\nThirteenth Kansas with Thomas J. Payne, mentioned elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe wagon road leading from Port William westward to the “old military\r\nroad,” bears the unique distinction of crossing the same creek fourteen\r\ntimes in a distance of less than three miles. It is not believed that\r\nthere is another creek in Atchison county that is crossed an equal\r\nnumber of times by one road. Little Walnut creek, which empties into the\r\nMissouri river at Port William, has its source near the Leavenworth\r\ncounty line. It flows northward through a heavily timbered country, and\r\nis one of the prettiest little streams in Atchison county. It was\r\nformerly called Bragg’s creek, after “Jimmy” Braggs, an early-day\r\nMissouri Pacific section foreman, who lived on its banks. Braggs\r\nafterward moved to Holton, where he died and the name of the creek was\r\nchanged to Little Walnut, after its neighbor, Walnut creek, which\r\nempties into the river at Dalby, about two miles above.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ARRINGTON.\r\n\r\nArrington is located on the Union Pacific railroad in the southwest part\r\nof the county. This town was platted August 20, 1884, and its original\r\npromoters were R. A. Van Winkle, D. S. Henecke. John Ballinger, D. D.\r\nHigh, D. A. Benjamin, J. M. Roberson, Michael Baker, J. S. Hopkins, Ira\r\nTabor and George W. Drake. Its streets are numbered one to four, and its\r\ncross streets are called Fountain avenue, Delaware street and Forest\r\navenue. Arrington has three general stores, one elevator and a bank.\r\nDuring good crop years, as high as 125 cars of grain and live stock are\r\nshipped from its station, and its stores do a good business, rendering\r\nfine service to the surrounding territory.\r\n\r\nAt one time prior to 1890 medicinal springs were located at Arrington\r\nand it was quite a resort during the summer months for people living in\r\nnortheastern Kansas. The town has a good hotel, and in addition to its\r\nmerchandise establishments it supports a physician and several churches.\r\n\r\nFor many years a mill was conducted on the Delaware river upon which\r\nArrington is located, operated by water power. This mill was built by\r\nJohn Reider in 1867, who also operated it both as a sawmill and as a\r\ngrain mill. In 1874 W. H. Stockton joined Mr. Reider, and these two men\r\nbuilt a two-story frame mill, but they operated it only one day, as it\r\nwas mysteriously burned the following night. Shortly thereafter Mr.\r\nReider, undismayed and undiscouraged, associated with himself Albert\r\nIngler, and remembering his previous disastrous experience with fire,\r\nMr. Reider built a stone mill. This firm conducted a successful business\r\nfor a number of years, drawing patronage for a distance of sixty miles,\r\nbut in 1879, Mr. Ingler met an untimely death, by drowning as he was\r\ncrossing the river, a few feet below where the Arrington bridge stands.\r\nMr. Reider sold his interest to D. S. Heneks, who ran the mill until\r\n1906, when John W. Young became its owner. He subsequently turned it\r\nover to George W. Stone, since which time it has been in possession of\r\nvarious owners, and in 1916 is owned by Burt McCulley. It has not been\r\noperated since 1908, and stands in ruins.\r\n\r\nA history of Arrington would be incomplete without the mention of the\r\nname of Ransom A. Van Winkle, who was the first settler in Kapioma\r\ntownship, and the founder of the town. Captain Van Winkle was born\r\nNovember 25, 1818, in Wayne county, Kentucky. He was a Hollander by\r\ndescent, and at one time his great-grandfather, Michael Van Winkle,\r\nowned an interest in 13,000 acres of land within twelve miles of New\r\nYork City, which was sold just prior to the Revolutionary war, for\r\ntwenty-five cents an acre. Van Winkle received the rudiments of his\r\neducation in a Kentucky log school house, but was for two years a cadet\r\nat West Point and received a good education. He was married twice and\r\nhad a varied experience in business, at one time owning a large interest\r\nin coal lands in Kentucky. He removed to St. Joseph, Mo., in 1849, and\r\nin September, 1855, came to Kansas and built the first claim cabin on\r\nthe Grasshopper, or what is now the Delaware river, above Valley Falls,\r\nin Kapioma township. He also built the first steam sawmill, sawed the\r\nfirst lumber, and built the first frame house, and taught the first\r\nschool in Kapioma township, and was the first postmaster at Arrington.\r\nHe always took an active part in politics in the county and was a stanch\r\nRepublican. He was a prominent Free State man in the early struggle in\r\nKansas and contributed liberally to the cause and worked hard in its\r\nbehalf. He was a justice of the peace in Papioma township for fourteen\r\nyears; postmaster five years; trustee of Kapioma township eight years; a\r\nmember of the legislature in 1861 and 1862 and county commissioner of\r\nAtchison county for six years. He was patriarchal in appearance and was\r\na conspicuous figure for many years in Republican conventions in\r\nAtchison county.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MUSCOTAH.\r\n\r\nThe name of “Muscotah” is of Indian origin, but when, why and by whom it\r\nwas applied to a town, seems to be a question. “Andreas’ History of\r\nKansas,” in a brief historical mention of the town of Muscotah, says:\r\n“The name Muscotah, written in Indian style, Musco-tah, signifies\r\n“Beautiful Prairie,” or “Prairie on Fire.” Andreas does not give any\r\nauthority for this statement, but on page 1343 in a biographical sketch\r\nof William D. Barnett, one of the earliest settlers of Muscotah, he says\r\nthat Mr. Barnett did not name the town, but that it was named by Paschal\r\nPensoneau, the old Kickapoo trader and interpreter. Mr. Kessler was a\r\nblacksmith among the Kickapoos at early day.\r\n\r\nMaj. C. B. Keith was one of the founders of Muscotah, and an early agent\r\nfor the Kickapoo Indians. In a letter under date of December 8, 1908,\r\nMrs. Keith, the widow of Major Keith, wrote that Muscotah was named by\r\nher husband and her two brothers, William P. and John C. Badger. She\r\ncorroborates Andreas in his statement that the name signifies “Beautiful\r\nPrairie,” or “Prairie on Fire,” and says that Muscotah should be\r\naccented on the last syllable. She further says that Paschal Pensoneau\r\nmay have suggested the name, and incidentally adds: “He was interpreter\r\nfor my brother, William P. Badger, who was Indian agent under President\r\nBuchanan, and later for my husband under Lincoln. He was a good friend\r\nfor both of my brothers and Major Keith, and accompanied my husband to\r\nWashington with the head chiefs when they made their treaty. The\r\noriginal Muscotah was on a fine site and justified the name.”\r\n\r\nThere is a town in the old Kickapoo country, in Illinois, named\r\nMascoutah, and believing it to be synonymous with the Atchison county\r\nname, though slightly different in orthography and pronunciation, Milo\r\nCuster, of Heyworth, Ill., the well known authority on the Kickapoos,\r\nwrote: “As to the meaning of the names Muscotah and Mascoutah, they are\r\nsynonymous with the old Algonquin word, Masko-teh, meaning ‘prairies.’\r\nThe Kickapoo word for prairies was one among others that I failed to get\r\nwhen I visited the tribe in Kansas in October, 1906. However, I am of\r\nthe opinion that the word was originally derived from Ma-shi O-shkoo-\r\nteh, meaning ‘Big Fire,’ and that it referred to the great prairie fires\r\nwhich swept over the country. In fact I have seen the opinion advanced\r\nby some other authority, but cannot now recall the name.” When the\r\nKickapoos lived in Illinois there was a band called the Mas-cou-tins,\r\nwhich Maj. H. W. Beckwith, the highest authority on the Illinois tribes,\r\nsays was the Indian name for “Indians of the Prairie.” Hence it is\r\nevident that the name Muscotah is at least a derivation of the word\r\n“prairie,” whether a “beautiful prairie” or “prairie of fire.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Scene on Main Street, Muscotah, Kansas\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  New Muscotah School Building. Erected 1916, at a cost of $20,000.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe plat of the Muscotah Town Company was filed by W. P. Badger, one of\r\nits proprietors, June 5, 1857, and the town is located in section 34,\r\ntownship 5, range 17, on the Central Branch railroad, near the western\r\nedge of the county. Its streets run from one to thirteen, and its cross\r\nstreets are named Pawpaw, Elm, Vine, Walnut, Mulberry, Hickory and Oak.\r\nFollowing the construction of the Central Branch railroad William Osborn\r\nfiled another plat of the town, and several amendments have since been\r\nmade to it. Muscotah has always been an important trading point, and one\r\nof the prosperous towns of the county. In 1916 there were three general\r\nstores, one hardware store, two banks, two elevators, one lumber yard,\r\ntwo cream stations, two barber shops, one harness shop, two drug stores,\r\ntwo restaurants, a hotel, private boarding house, two garages and\r\nblacksmith shops. The town also has four practicing physicians,\r\nincluding an osteopath, and one dentist. The first general store was\r\nestablished by Nels Brown in 1868, and a year later Watson & Guy put in\r\na general hardware store. Hagerman & Roach conducted a grain business in\r\n1865, and the first elevator was built in 1874. Several serious fires\r\nhave destroyed much property in Muscotah, the largest being known as the\r\nWatson fire, which occurred in 1883, destroying much property. The first\r\nmayor of the town was Dr. William P. Badger, who was elected in 1882.\r\nAlbert Harrington was the first postmaster, in 1866. The first physician\r\nto locate in the present limits of Muscotah was Dr. L. N. Plummer, who\r\ncame there in 1869. In 1868 a Dr. Heath located a few miles out from\r\nMuscotah, but never lived in the town. Dr. S. M. Riggs came in 1872 and\r\nhe and Dr. Plummer are both active physicians in the practice in 1916,\r\ntogether with Dr. O. O. Barter and Dr. F. A. Bermen. Years before\r\nMuscotah was established there was a small settlement nearby where there\r\nwere a few houses and a postoffice located about where the Robert\r\nRussell farm is. John Keeley, an enterprising early settler, built a\r\nflouring mill on the Grasshopper river, now known as the Delaware, in\r\n1869. Mr. Keeley did considerable business with the farmers in the\r\nsurrounding territory, but business finally fell off and the mill was\r\nwashed away by high water in 1895.\r\n\r\nMuscotah is an important shipping point, and the annual shipment of\r\ngrain amounts to $150,000 to $200,000. Much live stock is also shipped\r\nfrom Muscotah, and during the year 1915 fifty-two cars of cattle, hogs\r\nand horses were shipped to the Kansas City and St. Joseph markets.\r\n\r\nMuscotah is also a city of churches and schools. The Congregational\r\nchurch was established in 1866. The pastor of this church in 1916 is\r\nRev. Fred Gray, who preaches to a congregation of about 150. When this\r\nchurch was organized its members worshiped in the home of Robert\r\nRussell, which was at that time in the depot, and the church edifice\r\nwhich is now occupied was built in 1914.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist Episcopal church was established about 1876; it now has a\r\nmembership of 120, and its pastor is Rev. Rollo J. Fisher.\r\n\r\nThe Advent Christian church was organized in 1889, and its first pastor\r\nwas Rev. Marshall McCollough.\r\n\r\nMission Hall is maintained by unattached and unorganized Christians. It\r\nholds meeting several times a week, including two services on Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe public school system of Muscotah includes an accredited high school,\r\nin which two four-year courses are offered, together with a general and\r\ncollege preparatory course. R. E. Devor is superintendent of schools,\r\nand the officers of the school board are: J. F. Thompson, president; W.\r\nD. Roach, treasurer; R. A. Allison, secretary. The first school house\r\nwithin the present limits of the town was built in 1870, but was\r\nsubsequently destroyed by fire when another school was built in 1885. A\r\nsix room school was erected, and it was also destroyed by fire in\r\nJanuary, 1916. A movement is now under way to build a new, handsome,\r\nmodern school building, to accommodate twelve grades, together with\r\nmanual training, domestic science and a gymnasium.\r\n\r\nMuscotah is supplied with electricity by high tension line from\r\nAtchison, and in 1916 it has forty-two street lamps and fifty-five\r\nprivate consumers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a town of churches and schools, Muscotah also has\r\nseveral active lodges. The Masonic lodge was organized December 20,\r\n1871, by E. D. Hillyer, of Grasshopper Falls, on a dispensation issued\r\nby the grand lodge; the charter was issued October 17, 1872, and the\r\nofficers installed November 16, 1872. The first officers were: Ben F.\r\nFreeland, William N. Kline, Thomas H. Phillips, B. G. Merrill, D. M.\r\nStillman, W. Bullock and I. C. Archer.\r\n\r\nPurity Council No. 293, Knights and Ladies of Security, was chartered\r\nJuly 6, 1895, with John Edward Lewis, president. It had ten charter\r\nmembers and in 1916 there was a membership of seventy, with George W.\r\nRork, president, and Mrs. Carl Rork, secretary.\r\n\r\nModern Woodmen was chartered in August, 1898. The present officers are\r\nW. F. Murray, V. H. Little and G. W. Harris. There are also active\r\nlodges of the Mystic Workers, Eastern Star and Royal Neighbors.\r\n\r\nMuscotah’s new combination grade and high school, which will take the\r\nplace of the one destroyed by fire, will cost approximately $20,000, and\r\nwill be a fire-proof structure of brick and concrete. When completed it\r\nwill be one of the best school buildings of its kind in any town the\r\nsize of Muscotah in the State. The present city officials of Muscotah\r\nare: William Buckles, mayor; R. A. Hillyer, J. G. Burbank, W. D. Roach,\r\nR. H. Trial and R. A. Allison, councilmen; H. M. Turner, city clerk; E.\r\nM. Hicks, police judge, and S. B. Liggatt, marshal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EFFINGHAM.\r\n\r\nEffingham, the seat of Atchison county high school, is an incorporated\r\ntown, located sixteen miles west of Atchison, on the Central Branch\r\nrailroad, and was first platted by William Osborne April 4, 1868, who\r\nbuilt the first hundred miles of the Central Branch railroad, and is\r\nlocated on a part of the southwest quarter of section 15 and the\r\nnorthwest quarter of section 22, township 6, range 18. The original plat\r\ncontained only eight blocks and was subsequently cancelled. February 6,\r\n1871, Major W. F. Downs, land commissioner of the Central Branch\r\nrailroad, filed another plat in which one block was dedicated as a\r\npublic park and the streets numbered from one to ten, with cross streets\r\nas follows: Elizabeth, Seabury, Howard, George, William, and John. At\r\nthe opening of the Central Branch railroad Effingham enjoyed quite a\r\nboom and it has remained one of the finest towns in northeastern Kansas\r\never since.\r\n\r\nThere was a settlement around Effingham for a number of years prior to\r\nthe location of the townsite, and it was quite a trading point.\r\nEffingham is located on a broad sweep of prairie land, but there is very\r\nlittle of romance or legend connected with the town. There is one thing,\r\nhowever, for which it has always been noted, and to this extent\r\nEffingham occupies an unique place in the towns, not only of Atchison\r\ncounty, but of Kansas, namely: It has never been without a good hotel.\r\nThe original hotel was known far and wide throughout the country and was\r\nconducted by Aunt Betty Benton, a famous cook, who not only gave her\r\nguests good things to eat, but made of her hotel a favorite stopping\r\nplace for the traveling public on account of the hospitable way in which\r\nshe ran it. Uncle Jack Martin succeeded Aunt Betty and for many years\r\nthereafter kept up the high standard set by her. Then came Thomas F.\r\nCook, whose kindly welcome made friends for him among the hundreds of\r\nvisitors that came to Effingham from year to year, and who never left\r\nhis hotel without a full meal. Mr. Cook was succeeded by Mrs. Frank\r\nPitman, and she in turn was succeeded by Mrs. Davis, who, in 1915, is\r\nconducting the hotel at Effingham and maintains the high standard of\r\nexcellence of food and hospitality set by her predecessors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Main Street, Looking West, Effingham, Kansas\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong the early merchants of Effingham was Hon. Milton R. Benton, who\r\nwas born in Madison county, Kentucky May 3, 1815. He immigrated to\r\nKansas in 1857; located in Atchison, where he resided until 1867, during\r\nwhich year he moved to his farm in Atchison county, near Effingham. He\r\nwas the first marshal of the city of Atchison, having been elected in\r\n1858. In 1863 he was elected mayor of the city, and in 1864 was elected\r\na member of the council. He served as a member of the senate in the\r\nTerritorial council of 1859; in the State legislature in 1864, and for\r\nthree years as trustee of Center township. Benton township, in which\r\nEffingham is located, was named for him. He was educated as a Democrat,\r\nbut before he cast his first vote identified himself with the anti-\r\nslavery movement and became a Free State man in Kansas, but in after\r\nyears he supported Horace Greeley and became identified with the\r\nDemocratic party. In addition to farming he was in the real estate\r\nbusiness in Effingham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Presbyterian Church, Effingham, Kansas\r\n]\r\n\r\nA. F. Achenbach was one of the early liverymen of Effingham, and also\r\nwas George P. Allen, who was a dealer in hardware and grain; Ball &\r\nHerron, dealers in harness; Joel M. Ketch, hardware merchant; J. E.\r\nMcCormick, butcher; Alonzo Spencer, grocer; James Nesbitt, lumber\r\ndealer, and Simeon Walters, contractor and carpenter.\r\n\r\nP. J. O’Meara was a pioneer merchant of Effingham, and was a native of\r\nIreland, having been born in the county of Tipperary March 27, 1829. He\r\nfirst settled in Miami county, where he received his education, and in\r\n1865 he moved to Atchison and went into the grocery business on\r\nCommercial street, between Third and Fourth, later moving to Effingham\r\nwhen the townsite was located, and built one of the first store\r\nbuildings. He did a large and paying business, and his popularity was\r\nshown by the people of Effingham in electing him their first mayor.\r\n\r\nEffingham in 1915 had two hardware stores, one drug store, four general\r\nstores, two banks, two garages, two barber shops, one cream station, one\r\nclothing store, three restaurants, one hotel, one livery, and two\r\nelevators. Effingham is also a city of churches having one Catholic\r\nchurch, one Presbyterian church, Methodist church, Christian church and\r\nLutheran church. Its citizens are enterprising and progressive, and in\r\n1914 the city council secured a twenty-four hour electric light service\r\nover high tension line from Atchison. The elevators are owned by the\r\nFarmers’ Mercantile Association, and Snyder, Smith & Company. Tom Tucker\r\nand Beckman & Thomas are big live stock shippers, and they ship from\r\nninety-five to one hundred cars of live stock out of Effingham every\r\nyear, and the elevators ship over one hundred cars of grain every year.\r\n\r\nThe present city officials who have been so diligent and faithful in\r\ntheir services to Effingham are as follows:\r\n\r\nJ. W. Wallach, mayor; A. J. Sells, city clerk; G. M. Snyder, councilman;\r\nI. Ebert, councilman; D. Richter, councilman; James Farrell, councilman;\r\nE. J. Kelley, councilman; J. W. Atcheson, marshal; J. A. Harman, city\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HURON.\r\n\r\nHuron is located on the Omaha branch of the Missouri Pacific railway, in\r\nLancaster township, seventeen miles northwest of Atchison. The townsite\r\nwas originally the property of Col. D. R. Anthony, of Leavenworth. Mr.\r\nAnthony donated the railroad company twenty acres of land and the right\r\nof way for one mile. The surveys were made and the town named and\r\nplatted on May 18, 1882. Within six weeks after completion of the\r\nsurveys five dwellings were erected and the business interests of the\r\ntown were well represented. W. D. Starr was the first postmaster, and by\r\nthe end of the first year there were over fifty dwellings in the town,\r\nand among the first buildings to be erected were the Presbyterian and\r\nBaptist churches. Colonel Anthony donated lots upon which to build the\r\nchurches. J. D. Carpenter opened the first hotel in Huron. Mr. Carpenter\r\ncame to Kansas in 1874 and located on a farm near Huron, and when the\r\ntown was organized he moved there and opened his hotel. W. G. Rucker was\r\none of the early lumber dealers of Huron. He came from Corning, where he\r\nwas engaged in the general merchandise business, and moved to Huron when\r\nthe town was platted. Capt. George W. Stabler, for many years a resident\r\nof Huron, was one of the prominent politicians and characters of the\r\ncounty. He was born at Stablersville, Baltimore county, Maryland, in\r\n1839, where his ancestors had lived for over 200 years. He moved to\r\nKansas in 1858, settling in Lancaster township. He enlisted as a private\r\nin Company D, Second Kansas infantry, in 1861, for 100 days, and at the\r\nexpiration of that time he re-enlisted in the Second Kansas cavalry; was\r\nmade sergeant and was mustered out in 1865 and returned to his farm,\r\nsubsequently moving to Huron. In 1866 he was elected to the legislature,\r\nand in 1871 and 1872 served as deputy United States marshal. He had been\r\njustice of the peace, at the time of his death, a few years ago, for\r\nover twenty years.\r\n\r\nOld Huron was the original settlement near the present townsite of\r\nHuron, and was an important trading point for many years prior to the\r\nestablishment of the new townsite following the laying of the railroad\r\nto Omaha. There were many early settlers of importance in and around\r\nHuron, among whom was Capt. Robert White. Captain White came to Kansas\r\nin 1857 and bought the squatter rights of Charles Morgan and preëmpted a\r\nquarter section of land in Lancaster township, near Huron.\r\n\r\nThe birth of the first white child in Atchison county, of which there is\r\nany record, occurred in Lancaster township. The child was Miss Frances\r\nMiller, who was born May 9, 1855. Her father was the late Daniel Miller,\r\nan Ohioan by birth, and lived near DeKalb, Mo., in 1841. In 1854 he\r\nlooked over northeastern Kansas and settled on Independence creek,\r\ntwelve miles north of Atchison, early in 1855, near the northeastern\r\ncorner of Lancaster township. Mr. Miller sold his quarter section in\r\n1858, after he had proven up on it, to Thomas Butcher, a new arrival in\r\nKansas from Brownville, Pa., for $3,000. Mr. Butcher built a flouring\r\nmill on this land, which was run by water from Independence creek.\r\nButcher subsequently sold the plant to A. J. Evans, who ran it as a\r\n“custom mill” until August, 1865, when it was destroyed by high water,\r\ncaused by heavy rains.\r\n\r\nSamuel Wymore, for whom Wymore, Nebraska was named, was a resident of\r\nLancaster township, near Huron, in the fifties and early sixties, and\r\nran a sawmill by horse power, about three miles north of Lancaster, in\r\n1858. Mr. Wymore sold his first bill of lumber to Captain Robert White\r\nfor $100 in gold, and at that time it was more money than Wymore had\r\never seen at one time, and he was so nervous during the following night\r\nthat he could not sleep and continually stirred the fire in the stove so\r\nthat he could count the money from the light that it made. Wymore was\r\nuneducated. He could neither read nor write, and he was said to have\r\nbeen worth over $150,000 before 1875.\r\n\r\nIsaac E. Kelly, a young man from Pennsylvania, taught one of the first\r\nschools in Lancaster township, in one of the settlers’ preëmption cabin,\r\nnear Eden postoffice in 1860. He went to war in 1861 and marched with\r\nSherman to the Sea.\r\n\r\nThe first mowing machine in Atchison county was brought to Lancaster\r\ntownship, two miles west of where Huron now is, by Joel Hiatt, in 1859,\r\nwho sold it to Capt. Robert White, who cut hay with it several seasons.\r\nThe machine was a Ball, and a crude affair. The first reaper to harvest\r\ngrain in the county was owned by the late M. J. Cloyes, who also lived\r\nin Lancaster township, not many miles from Huron. Mr. Cloyes bought the\r\nreaper in the early sixties. The grain was raked off by a man lashed to\r\na post on a platform four or five feet to the rear of the cycle. This\r\nreaper was a Buckeye machine, and was sold by J. E. Wagner, the hardware\r\nmerchant of Atchison.\r\n\r\nThe forty acre tract of land upon which the home of Edward Perdue\r\nstands, a few miles east of Huron, was traded for a mowing machine by\r\nthe owner in 1865.\r\n\r\nBethel church, located southwest of Huron, is supposed to be the oldest\r\nchurch in the county, outside of Atchison. It was built by the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal church (South), about 1870, and is still in use in 1915.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that Huron is located in the midst of a very\r\ninteresting part of Atchison county, and while the town did not reach\r\nthe proportions that its original promoters had hoped for it, it is one\r\nof the good towns of the county. The following are the business houses\r\nin Huron in 1915:\r\n\r\n J. M. Delany—General merchandise.\r\n E. P. Perry—General merchandise.\r\n W. E. English—Hardware, implements and furniture.\r\n H. T. Harrison—Grocer.\r\n Dr. Wiley Jones—Drug store.\r\n John L. Snavly—Restaurant and postmaster.\r\n Mrs. Alta Wilson—Hotel.\r\n C. E. Mathew—Lumber.\r\n Loren Horton—Meat market.\r\n A. F. Allen—Grain, coal, live stock and automobile supplies.\r\n Baker-Corwell—Grain company.\r\n A. Morehead—Barber.\r\n W. Hildman—Blacksmith.\r\n Riley & Son—Livery barn.\r\n\r\nOver 200,000 bushels of grain are shipped from Huron annually and the\r\naverage shipment of live stock amounts to about forty cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OLD MARTINSBURG.\r\n\r\nMartinsburg was laid out near the present site of Potter in the early\r\ndays. It is not generally known, even among the old settlers, that there\r\nwas such a place. George Remsburg said that this was due probably to the\r\nfact that Martinsburg was born dead. It was conceived in the town craze\r\nof early territorial times, but it came a still-born infant and its\r\npromoters succeeded in viewing it only long enough for it to give a\r\nfeeble gasp and fall back dead again. Though this proposed municipal\r\nenterprise of pioneer days did not materialize, it was, nevertheless, an\r\ninteresting and important fact of local history, hitherto unrecorded,\r\nthat such a town was actually staked off and laid out in Atchison county\r\nat a very early period. The only old-timers who remembered it were James\r\nB. Low, of Colorado Springs, formerly of Mount Pleasant, “Uncle Joe”\r\nPotter, and W. J. (Jack) Bailey. All three settled in the southern part\r\nof Atchison county in 1854. Mr. Low settled with his parents in Walnut\r\ntownship in the fall of that year, and says that Martinsburg was laid\r\nout that fall. It was situated in what is known as the Mercer bottom, on\r\nland belonging to Felix Corpstein and Fred Poss, in the west half of\r\nsection 24, a little northeast of the present site of Potter, or\r\nimmediately adjoining it. What is known as the Mercer spring, one of the\r\nfinest in this section, was included in the town site. Mr. Low and his\r\nbrother went out to look at the place in the fall of 1854 and decided to\r\nspend the winter there. It consisted at that time of a few huts and a\r\nsmall store, and never amounted to any more than a village, if it could\r\nbe called that, although Mr. Low says the town site originally comprised\r\nabout 100 acres, and a few lots were actually sold. The store was a\r\nsmall frame building, erected by one Alex Hayes, who had previously\r\ntaken a claim on Plum creek, near Kickapoo. Mr. Low thinks this was the\r\nfirst frame building in Atchison county. Hayes carried a small stock of\r\ngoods. This was long before the town of Mt. Pleasant, in the same\r\nvicinity, was ever dreamed of, and even before Tom Fortune opened a\r\nstore there. It seems that the chief promoters of Martinsburg were two\r\nbrothers named Martin; hence the name. Not much is known concerning\r\nthem, or what became of them. “Uncle Joe” Potter says that one of them\r\ncame to his house on one occasion when he and his brother, Marion\r\nPotter, were making rails. Martin stood around a while and finally\r\ninsinuated that they were foolish for working so hard, and in a\r\nconfidential way, “just the same as told them,” as Mr. Potter expressed\r\nit, that they could make lots of money and make it easy stealing horses,\r\nwhereupon Marion Potter promptly ordered him off of the place, and told\r\nhim never to return. James Low’s father bought the town site of\r\nMartinsburg in the fall of 1855 and moved onto it in the spring of 1856,\r\nconverting it into a farm. Thus perished Martinsburg. Even the name did\r\nnot survive in the memory of the settlers, and it was only by accident\r\nthat it was recently recalled after a lapse of fifty-four years. At an\r\nearly day the locality became known as Mercer’s Bottom, after Joe\r\nMercer, one of the earliest settlers, and it is known by that name\r\ntoday. It is not known what became of Mercer. James Low says the last\r\ntime he saw him was in Denver, in 1859. Mercer was a queer character. It\r\nis told of him that he lived in a little cabin and subsisted principally\r\non mussels, which he found in Stranger creek. Alex Hayes, the\r\nMartinsburg storekeeper, has also been lost trace of, but Dick King says\r\nthere was an oldtimer named Alexander Hayes, who died many years ago and\r\nwas buried in the Sapp graveyard at Oak Mills. The town site of\r\nMartinsburg was a favorite camping place for soldiers and emigrants\r\npassing over the old Military road in the early days on account of the\r\nfine spring, the large meadows and the protection of the hills around\r\nit. To catch this tide of emigration was, in all probability, the object\r\nof those pioneer town projectors in selecting this site.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BUNKER HILL.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no data available which enables the historian to\r\ndetermine exactly where this town was located, but a prospectus\r\npublication March 18, 1858, in _Freedom’s Champion_, states that it was\r\non Independence creek, within ten miles of Atchison and twenty-five\r\nmiles of St. Joseph. Its chief promoter was Dr. Charles F. Kob, of\r\nAtchison. Dr. Kob was a German physician and surgeon, who located in\r\nAtchison at an early date. He had been a surgeon in the army, and a\r\nmember of the Massachusetts and Connecticut medical societies. He lived\r\nand practiced medicine in Boston for some time. About the only advantage\r\nfor Bunker Hill, set forth in the prospectus, was that coal was found\r\naround the place, but Bunker Hill never seemed to have any coal in her\r\nbunkers. She failed to flourish and no Bunker Hill monument perpetuates\r\nher memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LOCUST GROVE.\r\n\r\nLocust Grove was never laid out as a town site. It was a stopping place\r\non the old stage route to Topeka, and the postoffice from Mount Pleasant\r\nwas moved there in 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HELENA.\r\n\r\nHelena was located and named in this county, and the plat thereof was\r\nfiled March 18, 1857, by James L. Byers, one of the proprietors of the\r\ntown company, and was located on the north half of section 28, township\r\n5, range 18, on the Little Grasshopper river, in Grasshopper township,\r\nat the crossing of the old Military road, five miles north of the\r\npresent site of Effingham. The town appears on an old township map of\r\neastern Kansas, published by Whitman & Searl, of Lawrence, in 1856. It\r\nshows it to have been on the east branch of Grasshopper river, about\r\nfifteen miles west of Atchison, and north of the Ft. Laramie and\r\nCalifornia roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CAYUGA.\r\n\r\nCayuga was laid out by a New York colony in 1856, and was named for\r\nCayuga, N. Y. It was also in Grasshopper township, on the old Military\r\nroad, one and one-half miles from Lancaster township line on part of the\r\neast half of section 18, township 5, range 18. It was surveyed by Dr. A.\r\nC. Tabor, and the plat was filed October 9, 1857, by George L. Willson.\r\nProvision was made in the town site for a public park and a young\r\nladies’ seminary. It was claimed that it had at one time 400\r\ninhabitants. Among the members of the town company were Messrs. Smooks,\r\nFuller, Higby, Atherton, Ontis, Meeker, William Adams, Chase and Dr.\r\nTaylor. The land on which the town was located was “junked” as a claim\r\nby a Mrs. Place, and thereafter the town gradually went out of\r\nexistence. It is said to have had a good two-story hotel and a number of\r\nbusiness houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               KENNEKUK.\r\n\r\nIn the plat which Royal Baldwin, president of the town company, filed\r\nApril 6, 1859, the name of this town is given as Kennekuck. It was\r\nlocated on the southeast quarter and the southwest fractional quarter of\r\nsection 3, township 5, range 17. Its streets were sixty feet wide,\r\nexcept Broadway, which was 100 feet wide, and Market street, which was\r\neighty feet wide. One block was donated for a market house, and another\r\nblock for a park, for religious and educational purposes. The streets\r\nwere numbered from 1 to 10 and the cross streets were named as follows:\r\nElm, Linn, Cedar, Poplar, Broadway, Market, Walnut, Weld, Perry and\r\nBaldwin. The town site was vacated by the board of county commissioners\r\nDecember 15, 1871. Kennekuk was a station on the Overland stage route,\r\ntwenty-four miles west and north of Atchison. During the overland stage\r\ndays Thomas Perry ran an eating station there, and Mrs. Perry, who was a\r\ngrand cook, always had a smoking hot dinner ready with the best of\r\ncoffee, for the occupants of the stage coaches. In the early days dances\r\nwere held in the Perry home, and Hon. D. W. Wilder, the author of the\r\ncelebrated “_Annals of Kansas_,” used to trip the light fantastic toe\r\nthere, and it is said that he courted the girl who afterwards became his\r\nwife, in the Perry home.\r\n\r\nFrank A. Root, who was an express messenger on the overland stage, says,\r\nin his book, that Kennekuk was the first “home” station out from\r\nAtchison, and the drivers were changed there. In 1863 it was a little\r\ntown of perhaps a dozen houses with one store and a blacksmith shop. The\r\nKickapoo Indian Agency was one of the most prominent buildings there,\r\nand was located near the old road in the northwestern part of the town.\r\nThe town was laid out by William H. Wheeler, a surveyor and speculator,\r\nand was named for the Kickapoo chieftain, John Kennekuk. George Remsburg\r\nsays that the town was platted in June, 1854, but the dedication on the\r\noriginal plat in the court house would indicate that it was platted on\r\nthe date first mentioned in this sketch.\r\n\r\nHon. A. J. White, the son of Capt. Robert White, and at one time a\r\nmember of the legislature from this county, and one of the leading\r\nfarmers of the county, claims that Royal Baldwin was the first white\r\nsettler in Kennekuk, and that he was appointed Indian agent for the\r\nKickapoos there by President Pierce before Kansas was opened for\r\nsettlement. Mr. Remsburg also says that many noted travelers stopped at\r\nKennekuk, including Mark Twain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                KAPIOMA.\r\n\r\nAccording to Captain Elberhant, of Golden, Colo., the Kickapoo Indians\r\nonce had a village on the Grasshopper river in Atchison county, called\r\nKapioma, after the chief of the band, and it is from this source that\r\nKapioma township took its name. Captain Berthoud says that Father\r\nDuerinck, a native of Belgium, who was probably the first Jesuit priest\r\nin Atchison county, gave the pronunciation of the name of his Atchison\r\ncounty station as Kah-pi-oma, accent on the syllable “Kah.”\r\n\r\nIn an affidavit of H. H. Skiles, volume 69, page 63, in the records of\r\nthe office of the register of deeds of Atchison county, Kansas, the\r\nfollowing appears:\r\n\r\n“This affiant further states that there was in 1857 and 1858 a company\r\nformed, called and known as the Kapioma City Company, and the\r\nindividuals composing that company were B. Gray, S. C. Russell, W. W.\r\nWeston, H. H. Skiles and W. Y. Roberts, who united themselves together\r\nfor the purpose of laying out, locating and establishing a town called\r\nKapioma, on what was then known as Grasshopper creek, just north of its\r\nconfluence with Straight creek, in the western borders of Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas. The entire purpose and scheme in laying out and\r\nestablishing a town fell through and was wholly and totally abandoned by\r\nall and every person connected with it without prejudice to any one, and\r\nthe title to the land intended by the company to become town property\r\nreverted to the original owner. The law required to establish a town was\r\nnever complied with.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MASHENAH.\r\n\r\nMashenah, apparently, was to be a rival town of Kennekuk. The cold and\r\nquiet records now on file in the court house would convey the idea that\r\nRoyal Baldwin must have fallen out with the original promoters of\r\nKennekuk and decided to establish a town of his own, so, accordingly, he\r\nfiled a plat of this town September 21, 1857, showing it to be located\r\nin the northeast quarter and the northwest quarter of section 2,\r\ntownship 5, range 17. One block was set aside for a college and another\r\nfor a park. Its streets were numbered 1 to 21, and the cross streets\r\nwere named as follows: Oak, Pine, Plum, Vine, Elm, Linn and Cedar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ST. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nThe only record that can be found of this town is that Thomas Poteet\r\nfiled a plat thereof April 20. 1858, showing it to be located in the\r\nsouthwest corner of section 6, township 7, range 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONCORD.\r\n\r\nThis is another town about which there is little information available.\r\nThe plat was filed June 20, 1857, by James R. Whitehead and shows it to\r\nhave been located in the west half of section 1, township 5, range 17.\r\nThe streets were numbered from 1 to 18, and the cross streets were named\r\nBuchanan, Emily, Mary, Carolina, Jefferson, St. Joseph, Ellwood, Able,\r\nAlexander, and there were two public squares, called North and South.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PARNELL.\r\n\r\nThe plat of Parnell was filed December 24, 1883, by J. C. Hotham, and\r\nshows the town site to be located in the southwest corner of the\r\nsoutheast quarter of section 20, township 6, range 20. It is located on\r\nboth the Santa Fe and the Missouri Pacific railroads. The station was\r\nnamed for a hero of the Civil war, James L. Parnell, a private soldier\r\nin Company F, Thirteenth Kansas volunteer infantry, who was killed\r\nduring the skirmish at Haare Head, Ark., August 4, 1864. Parnell was the\r\noriginal settler on the site of Parnell and was one of the first\r\ncitizens of Atchison county to respond under President Lincoln’s call of\r\nJuly, 1862. He enlisted in the Thirteenth Kansas. Ex-Sheriff Frank\r\nHartin was a comrade of Parnell in Company F and married into the\r\nParnell family.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SHANNON.\r\n\r\nShannon was platted by G. W. Sutliff February 22, 1883. and is located\r\nin the northwest corner of the northeast quarter of section 1. township\r\n6, range 19, about eight miles west of Atchison, on the Parallel road.\r\nThe town consists of one store building, in which the postoffice is\r\nlocated, and a few residences, together with railroad station and a\r\nsmall elevator.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ELMWOOD.\r\n\r\nElmwood was platted by Anna Hoke and J. S. Hoke April 12, 1873, and was\r\nlocated on the south half of the northeast quarter of section 2,\r\ntownship 6, range 20. This was a “paper” town, and the only record now\r\navailable of it is the plat on file in the court house at Atchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CUMMINGSVILLE.\r\n\r\nCummingsville was platted by William Cummings December 16, 1872, and was\r\nlocated on the north half of the southwest quarter of section 1,\r\ntownship 7, range 19, on the line of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe\r\nrailway, southwest of Atchison, in Center township, and took its name\r\nfrom the founder of the town. The original plat provided for two\r\nstreets, Market and Main, but on September 21, 1883, Samuel C. King\r\nfiled a plat, creating an addition to Cummingsville, composed of four\r\nblocks. The first settler on the townsite was Robert Kennish, who\r\nlocated there in November, 1872, and was appointed postmaster when the\r\npostoffice was established the following fall. Mr. Kennish opened the\r\nfirst store in Cummingsville in December, 1872, and he for many years\r\nwas station agent there, one of the oldest in the service of the\r\nAtchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railway. He was a much beloved character. He\r\ndied a few years ago at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Nelson W. Cox,\r\nwho lives in Cummingsville with her invalid husband, Nels Cox, who for\r\neight years served Atchison county in the capacity of clerk of the\r\ncourt. In April, 1873, C. D. Harrison and family located in\r\nCummingsville, and their child, Lorenzo, was the first child born on the\r\ntownsite, and his was also the first death, Lorenzo having died March\r\n25, 1875. In the winter of 1880–81, R. C. Ripple taught the first\r\nschool, and the Methodist church (South) was built in 1880.\r\nCummingsville now is a town of over 100 residences, and in addition to\r\nits bank, it has several good stores, a cream station and an elevator.\r\nMuch grain and live stock is shipped out of Cummingsville annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EDEN P. O.\r\n\r\nEden was located about eight miles northwest of Atchison, and Charles\r\nServoss was appointed the first postmaster there in 1858. The postoffice\r\nwas located on a farm adjoining the Johnson Wymore farm on the south.\r\nServoss resigned as postmaster in 1863 and removed to Detroit, Mich. He\r\nwas succeeded by H. C. Lee, who kept the office on a farm adjoining the\r\nWymore farm on the west. Mr. Lee was a grandfather of Miss Kate Platt\r\nand Mrs. S. F. Harburger, formerly of Atchison, and the father of Mrs.\r\nFlora B. Hiatt. Mr. Lee held the office until 1872, when Francis\r\nSchletzbaum, Sr., was named as postmaster, and removed the office to his\r\nfarm, which adjoined the old Wymore farm on the north. The postoffice\r\nremained there until it was discontinued upon the establishment of free\r\nrural delivery service in 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                POTTER.\r\n\r\nPotter is pleasantly situated on a slight rise or knoll in the beautiful\r\nvalley of Stranger creek, and near the southeast corner of Mt. Pleasant\r\ntownship. From the first it has been the principal station on the Santa\r\nFe railroad, between Atchison and Leavenworth, being situated about\r\nmidway between the two cities. It is an attractive little town, with\r\nwell graded streets and good cement sidewalks, and a number of\r\nattractive residences. While it is one of the younger towns of the\r\ncounty, it has made strides that make it compare favorably with some of\r\nits older sisters, in volume of business at least, if not in population.\r\n\r\nPotter, as the home of the white man, dates back further than any\r\ncommunity in the county. Elsewhere in this history will be found an\r\naccount of Paschal Pensoneau, the old French trader, who established\r\nhimself on Stranger creek, near the present townsite, during the early\r\nforties.\r\n\r\nThe building of Potter is the third and the most successful attempt to\r\nestablish a town in that vicinity. The first attempt was at Mount\r\nPleasant. This was one of the first towns started in Kansas, and here\r\nwas located the first postoffice in Atchison county. It prospered for a\r\ntime and was a candidate for the county seat. It gradually declined, and\r\nsince the establishment of Potter, has been little more than a memory.\r\nIn the early days, some say before Mt. Pleasant was started, a town was\r\nlaid out near the big Mercer spring, just northeast of the present site\r\nof Potter, and called Martinsburg. It was extensively boomed, but\r\noutside of a small store and a few huts, it never advanced beyond the\r\npaper stage.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1886 the Leavenworth, Northern & Southern railway, now a branch\r\nof the Santa Fe, and known as the “Pollywog,” was built and a station\r\nlocated where Potter now stands. A town was platted and called Bennett\r\nSprings, after James Gordon Bennett, the well known eastern journalist.\r\nThe mineral springs on the Masterson farm near the townsite were\r\nattracting considerable attention at the time, and it was thought that a\r\npopular resort could be built up there. The medicinal properties of the\r\nwater were discovered by Dr. Rice, a local physician, and subsequently\r\nanalyzed by experts, who confirmed Dr. Rice’s conclusions, and a number\r\nof people claimed to have used the waters in liver, kidney and other\r\ncomplaints with good results. Henry C. Squires, afterwards a Potter\r\nbanker, conceived the idea of establishing a health resort here, and\r\nnamed it in honor of James Gordon Bennett, who, it was thought, would\r\nuse his influence towards getting eastern capital interested in the\r\nproject. The expected financial backing was not forthcoming, however,\r\nand the proposed development of the springs was never made.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the railroad people had christened the town Potter, in\r\nhonor of Hon. Joseph Potter, owner of the quarter section on which the\r\ntown was laid out, and, while the name of the town still appears on the\r\ntax rolls as Bennett Springs, the original name having never been\r\nlegally changed, the town is now generally known as Potter. Joseph\r\nPotter was the original settler, having preëmpted the land on which the\r\ntown stands, in 1854, and the first sales of lots in Potter were deeded\r\nto their purchaser thirty-two years later direct from the Government\r\npreëmption owner. The taking up of the land, filing, etc., cost Mr.\r\nPotter about $220 for 160 acres, and when it was divided up into town\r\nlots it brought him $200 an acre. Mr. Potter entered part of this land\r\nwith a land warrant given him for services in the Mexican war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Street Scene, Potter, Kansas\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first lots in the town were sold to the late James Stalons, for many\r\nyears a justice of the peace, preacher of the Gospel and prominent\r\ncitizen of the county. The first house on the townsite was built by\r\nThomas J. Potter in 1882, four years before the town was laid out. The\r\nhouse is still standing. The first business house in the town was\r\nerected by Charles Klein, who operated a store there until his death. A\r\nyear or two after Potter was started the postoffice was removed from Mt.\r\nPleasant to the place, and James B. Weir was the first postmaster. The\r\nfirst hotel was operated by Mrs. Elvira Pierce. Dr. Barnes had the first\r\ndrug store, and was also the first physician; Frank Blodgett, the first\r\nhardware store, and B. F. Shaw & Company, the first furniture store. The\r\nfirst barber was Thomas Seever; the first blacksmith, Lou Chilson; the\r\nfirst butcher, John Yost; the first carpenter, P. H. Fleer; the first\r\npainters, George Brown and Grant Cass; the first stone masons, S. B.\r\nMorrow and Frank Maxwell; the first shoemaker, Patrick Murphy; the first\r\nstock buyer, Henry Show; the first school teacher, Albert Limbaugh; the\r\nfirst railroad agent, C. L. Cherrie; the first lumber dealer, David\r\nHudson; the first harness maker, Harry Rickets; the first rural mail\r\ncarrier, Frank White. Frank Mayfield operated the first livery stable;\r\nthe first elevator was built by James Hawley; the first church building\r\nwas that of the Methodists. The first Methodist preacher was Rev. John\r\nW. Faubian, and the first Christian preacher, Rev. T. W. Cottingham. The\r\nfirst telephone exchange was operated by Charles and George Sprong. The\r\nfirst lodge was Echo Lodge, No. 103, Independent Order of Odd Fellows.\r\nThe first bank was the Potter State Bank. Potter has had three\r\nnewspapers, the first, the _Potter Press_, was established by E. E.\r\nCampbell, in 1898. In 1900 Mr. and Mrs. Eppie Barber started the _Potter\r\nLeaf_. Three years later Charles B. Remsburg bought the _Leaf’s_\r\ncirculation and launched the _Potter Kansan_, which is now owned and\r\npublished by his father, J. E. Remsburg.\r\n\r\nPotter is one of the most flourishing towns of its size in Kansas.\r\nThough its population is less than 200, it boasts of two banks, the\r\naggregate resources of which amount to nearly a quarter million dollars.\r\nThere probably is not another town of its size in the State that has two\r\nbanks. The town has two good elevators which during the years 1912, 1913\r\nand 1914 handled on an average of 140,000 bushels of grain a year. These\r\nelevators are operated by Fred Ode & Sons and James Robinson. The\r\nrailroad station at Potter does a business that amounts to something\r\nlike $40,000 annually. The shipping of live stock is an important\r\nindustry here. The principal buyers are Tinsley, Potter, and Timple\r\nBros. Much fruit is grown around Potter, and as high as $20,000 has been\r\npaid out for apples during one shipping season.\r\n\r\nPotter has a rural high school, the first of its kind established in the\r\nState, and an $8,000 school building.\r\n\r\nThe town has two general stores, those of W. A. Hodge and P. P. Knoch; a\r\nhardware store, operated by B. F. Shaw; a grocery store, by Thomas J.\r\nPotter; a furniture store, by Frank Beard; a drug store, by G. E.\r\nCoulter; a hotel, by Mrs. G. F. Pope; two blacksmith shops, by R. E.\r\nBrown and G. F. Pope; a livery stable, by H. G. Hawley; two barber\r\nshops, by George Brown and Frank Blankenship; a cement tile factory, by\r\nGrisham & Maxwell; a millinery store, by Mrs. T. J. Maxwell; a telephone\r\nexchange, by E. C. Yoakum; a newspaper, _The Potter Weekly Kansan_, by\r\nJ. E. Remsburg; two physicians, Dr. G. W. Redmon and Dr. S. M. Myers.\r\nDr. A. E. Ricks, of Atchison, has a branch dental office here; the\r\nLambert Lumber Company, of Leavenworth, has a commodious and well\r\nstocked yard here, with Samuel Parker as manager. There are two\r\nchurches, Methodist and Christian, two public halls, and one lodge hall.\r\nL. M. Jewell conducts an insurance, real estate and loan business. There\r\nis also a garage, and other business enterprises in the town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  School House, Potter, Kansas\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MOUNT PLEASANT.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Thomas L. Fortune, Jr., a Virginian, settled on the “old\r\nMilitary road” and opened one of the very earliest stores in Atchison\r\ncounty, around this store springing up the village of Mount Pleasant. A\r\npostoffice was established here in 1855, and Mr. Fortune was appointed\r\npostmaster. Being an inventive genius, he finally gave up his store\r\nbusiness and devoted his energies towards perfecting and building a\r\nroad-wagon, to which reference has heretofore been made, and which he\r\nthought would revolutionize the freighting business across the plains.\r\n\r\nThe townsite of Mount Pleasant was surveyed in 1857 by John P. Wheeler,\r\nagent for the Town Company.\r\n\r\nMichael Wilkins and James Laird were the very first settlers in the\r\ntownship, being followed shortly afterwards by Levi Bowles, Jacob\r\nGrindstaff, Andrew J. Peebler, Martin Jones, Chris Horn, P. R. King, W.\r\nC. Findley, A. S. Speck and Amos Hamon.\r\n\r\nThe first hotel in the town was opened by Henry Payne, who operated it\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nT. J. Payne and Philo W. Hull were the next parties to engage in\r\nbusiness, Mr. Payne leaving when the new town of Sumner was started, and\r\nlocating there.\r\n\r\nThe next to engage in business was P. R. King, who established a general\r\nstore about 1858. He remained at Mount Pleasant until after the county\r\nseat question had been settled, when he removed to Atchison.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1858 a district school was opened. In 1860 the Cumberland\r\nPresbyterians erected a church building, having held religious services\r\nat the homes of the members prior to this time. Rev. A. A. Moore was\r\ntheir first pastor.\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1862, the Church of Christ was organized by Elder W. S.\r\nJackson, with seventeen members, services being held in the school\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMount Pleasant Lodge, No. 158, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, of\r\nMount Pleasant, was organized in the fall of 1868 by the following\r\ncharter members: William J. Young, X. Klein, M. R. Benton, John Hawley.\r\nS. K. McCreary, Joseph Howell and Albert Hawley. Their first meeting was\r\nheld October 20, 1868, with the following as first officers: William\r\nYoung, worshipful master; X. Klein, senior warden; A. Hawley, junior\r\nwarden; S. K. McCreary, secretary; M. R. Benton, treasurer.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1862, the name of the postoffice was changed to Locust Grove.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LEWIS’ POINT.\r\n\r\nIn pre-territorial times and in the steamboat days, Kansas had many\r\ngeographical names that are not now to be found on the map. Some of\r\nthem, where permanent settlements have sprung up, have been perpetuated,\r\nbut the majority of them do not live even in the memory of the oldest\r\ninhabitants. One of the latter is “Lewis’ Point,” near the present site\r\nof Oak Mills. Old “Cap.” Lewis is long since dead, his name almost\r\nforgotten, and the rapacious Missouri river and “Mansell’s Slide” are\r\nnow about to devour the “Point.” with which his name was coupled in our\r\nearly geography. While “Lewis’ Point” was never a place of any\r\nprominence, and not even the site of a village or settlement, yet it was\r\na geographical name that was known to every steamboat man running on\r\nthis section of the river, and is worthy of preservation in our local\r\nhistory. “Lewis’ Point” was at the projection of land lying immediately\r\nabove Oak Mills, on the Missouri river. It took its name from the fact\r\nthat Calvin Lewis, an old riverman, settled at this point at an early\r\nday, and it became a frequent stopping place for steamboats to take on\r\nwood. In those days there was a splendid wood supply in that vicinity.\r\nLewis’ house stood near the site of the old Champton, or William Moody,\r\nhouse, which was destroyed by fire about a year ago.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that a steamboat was ever built on Atchison\r\ncounty soil, much less that Oak Mills was ever the scene of the ship\r\nbuilder’s craft, outside of the construction of Indian canoes and the\r\nmodern skiffs built by Dick King or some other later-day river man. Yet,\r\nit is a fact that Calvin Lewis once built and launched at “Lewis’ Point”\r\na small stern-wheel steamboat, and operated it on the river for several\r\nyears. In 1855 the first territorial legislature of Kansas passed an act\r\nauthorizing Lewis to operate a ferry at “Lewis’ Point.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FARLEY’S FERRY.\r\n\r\nThe same legislature that gave permission to Lewis to operate a ferry at\r\n“Lewis’ Point,” granted the same privilege to Nimrod Farley, to maintain\r\na ferry across the Missouri river, opposite Iatan, Mo. Farley was a well\r\nknown character in the Missouri bottoms in the vicinity of Iatan, Cow\r\nIsland, and Oak Mills, in the early days. He lived near Iatan, but it\r\nseems that he owned land on the Kansas side, near Oak Mills, which\r\noffered a landing for his ferry. He was a brother of Josiah Farley, who\r\nlaid out the town of Farley, in Platte county, in 1850. George McAdow\r\nlater became proprietor of Farley’s Ferry and operated it until it was\r\ndestroyed by Jayhawkers, shortly before the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                             THE CIVIL WAR.\r\n\r\n  THE ISSUE BETWEEN EARLY SETTLERS—INFLUX OF FREE STATE AND PRO-SLAVERY\r\n      PARTISANS—EARLY VOLUNTEERING—MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS—THREATENED\r\n      INVASION FROM MISSOURI—POLITICAL SOCIETIES—JAYHAWKERS—CLEVELAND’S\r\n      GANG—LYNCHINGS—ATCHISON COUNTY TROOPS IN THE WAR—PRICE’S ATTEMPTED\r\n      INVASION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe six years intervening between 1854 and 1860 constitute a momentous\r\nperiod in the history of Atchison county. No new community was ever\r\norganized under more unpromising circumstances. It was not merely land\r\nhunger and lust for personal gain that were the impelling motives which\r\nbrought men to Kansas in that day. Neither gold, nor gas, nor oil, nor\r\nprecious gems lured men here. Kansas was then, as it is now, an\r\nagricultural paradise, and such an environment has ordinarily but little\r\ncharm for the daring adventurer and the seeker after sudden riches, who\r\ntoil not and spin less. It is true that a large number of peaceful,\r\nplodding home-seekers—the tillers of the soil—the hewers of wood and the\r\nhaulers of water, immigrated to Kansas to take up land and build\r\npermanent homes, but they were in the minority prior to 1860. The\r\ntremendous issue of human slavery was the all absorbing fact, and the\r\nlong struggle here wrought a complete revolution in the political\r\nthought of the whole country. Men came to Kansas for the most part for\r\npolitical rather than for business or agricultural reasons. The\r\nsettlement of Kansas was an inspired political movement of partisans.\r\nThere was little room for neutrals, and those who were “too proud to\r\nfight” went elsewhere. There was little consideration on the part of the\r\nearly settlers of Kansas, of any questions except slavery and anti-\r\nslavery. They came in large numbers from the South and from the North,\r\nand met here upon the frontier in a final test of strength. The Free\r\nSoilers won, but only after bitter contests in which passion, prejudice\r\nand bloody partisanship ran riot, and Atchison county played a most\r\nconspicuous part in this great battle. The Nation and the world looked\r\non as the battle lines surged forward and backward. And while they\r\nfought here in a last desperate struggle for supremacy, these courageous\r\nmen and women on both sides founded their towns, built their court\r\nhouses, their primary schools and their churches with an abiding faith\r\nin the hearts of each of them that victory would finally crown their\r\nefforts. Atchison county made progress in spite of the fact that her\r\nleaders were wrong. We gave promise here of being the metropolis of\r\nKansas, for we had many geographical and commercial advantages over\r\nother struggling communities of the Territory. But before the well laid\r\nplans of our citizens matured, before projects for the development of\r\nsteam transportation to bring us nearer the outside world could be\r\nconcluded the mighty conflict which ended in four bloody years of civil\r\nwar, broke upon the Nation, and Kansas within three months after being\r\nadmitted as a State enrolled itself on the side of the Union. Atchison\r\ncounty sprang to arms almost a thousand strong, and may it ever be said\r\nto its everlasting glory that few, if any, counties in the State had a\r\nmore patriotic record. One hundred and thirty-one Atchison county men\r\nenlisted in the First Kansas regiment; twenty-five in the Seventh;\r\neighty-five in the Eighth; eighty-six in the Tenth; 260 in the\r\nThirteenth; 100 in the First Kansas (colored); twenty-five in the First\r\nNebraska; 105 in the Thirteenth Missouri; thirty in the Fifteenth\r\nKansas; forty in the Ninth, and fifty in the Sixteenth, or a total of\r\n937 men, which, together with the scattering of men in other regiments\r\nin adjoining States, brought the total number of soldiers engaged during\r\nthe Civil war to 1,000. The population of Atchison county at that time\r\nwas 7,747, and the voting population 1,133, which shows that the total\r\nnumber of voters was but slightly larger than the total number of\r\nvolunteers. At that time Atchison, by reason of its location, was\r\nsubject to incursions from Confederate troops and Jayhawkers from\r\nMissouri, which called for the organization at different periods of the\r\nwar, of home guard companies, which are not included in the foregoing\r\nstatement. At the outset of the war Atchison had three militia\r\ncompanies, A, B and C, and a fourth, known as the All Hazard company,\r\nthe origin of whose name is thus explained. At the city election in the\r\nspring of 1861 the issue was union or dis-union. The Republicans and\r\nUnion Democrats united in supporting G. H. Fairchild for mayor. He was a\r\nUnion Democrat who on various occasions announced his unwavering\r\nfriendship of the Union and for the maintenance of the constitution and\r\nlaws “at all hazards,” and when this company enlisted for the war Mayor\r\nFairchild was its captain and it became Company K of the First Kansas.\r\nIt participated in the battle of Wilson’s Creek, August 10, 1861, which\r\nwas the first action in which a Kansas regiment was under fire.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 there were constant threats of invasion from Missouri rebel\r\norganizations in Buchanan and Platte counties, and in that year another\r\nhome guard company was organized with the following officers: Charles\r\nHolbert, captain; J. G. Bechtold, first lieutenant; Clem Rhor, second\r\nlieutenant; W. Becker, third lieutenant; John Schupp, ensign. During the\r\nfollowing year the danger of invasion became still more threatening and\r\n650 men in sixteen companies came to Atchison to protect the town from\r\ndestruction. The Atchison county companies were commanded by Captains\r\nHolbert, Hays, Batsett, Evans and Vanwinkle. It was due to the\r\nthoroughness with which the people of Atchison organized themselves\r\nagainst invasion that they were spared from being completely\r\nannihilated. On the fifteenth day of September, 1861, another company\r\nfor home guard service was mustered in at Ft. Leavenworth. J. M. Graham\r\nwas captain; J. G. Bechtold, first lieutenant; R. N. Bryant, second\r\nlieutenant. This company subsequently became Company E of the First\r\nKansas Regiment Home Guards, numbering fifty men, and were ordered back\r\nto Atchison for duty, where they were stationed until all danger of\r\ninvasion had passed, after which the company became a part of the Eighth\r\nKansas. The victories of the Union forces in 1862 were frequent, and as\r\na result many rebel sympathizers came to Atchison for safety, where they\r\nbecame very troublesome. In order to counteract the growing evil over\r\nthe activities of these men, Mayor Fairchild issued a proclamation in\r\nwhich he warned them that they must not expect to be protected in any\r\nmanner by the city laws as long as they held to the views which they\r\nexpounded at even favorable opportunity. “It would be absurd to\r\nsuppose,” the proclamation said, “that a patriotic community could treat\r\notherwise than its enemies, persons who are in sympathy with base men\r\nwho have brought upon our country untold misery, almost unlimited\r\ntaxation and almost inconceivable pecuniary suffering. As a\r\nrepresentative of a loyal people I will not encourage men to return\r\namong us who have circulated reports that they were refugees from the\r\nloyal States on account of their secession doctrines, nor will I give\r\nprotection to men who unmistakably at heart belong to the Confederacy.”\r\nThis proclamation met with such favor that a mass meeting of Union men\r\nin Atchison county was held at Price’s Hall March 15, 1862. The whole\r\ncounty was well represented and stirring addresses were delivered by\r\nColonel Edge, of Doniphan county, Tom Murphy, the genial proprietor of\r\nthe Massasoit House, Rev. W. S. Wenz, Lieutenant Price, E. Chesebrough,\r\nMayor Fairchild, Caleb May, and others, after which resolutions\r\ndenouncing the southern sympathizers and notifying them not to return\r\nwere unanimously adopted. During the latter part of the same year a call\r\nfor aid to assist the Atchison county troops met with immediate response\r\nand within a few days, commencing August 20, 1862, almost $4,000 was\r\nsubscribed by the citizens of Atchison. Seven hundred and forty-five\r\ndollars came from Mt. Pleasant township. Among the leading contributors\r\nwere Theodore Bartholow, E. Chesebrough, G. W. Fairchild, J. W. Russell,\r\nW. L. Challiss, Dr. William Irwin, G. W. Howe, Bela M. Hughes, William\r\nHetherington, Otis & Glick, Henry Deisbach, J. E. Wagner, Rice McCubbin,\r\nMcCausland & Brown, Tom Murphy, W. A. Cochrane, Samuel C. Pomeroy,\r\nStebbins & Company, E. Butcher, and William C. Smith, each of whom\r\nsubscribed the sum of $50 or over. Atchison also made a notable\r\ncontribution when Quantrell invaded Lawrence, sending $4,000 to assist\r\nthe people of that city. In 1863 depredations of the Jayhawkers became\r\nvery annoying, and a vigilance committee was organized and all good,\r\npeaceful and loyal citizens were called upon to band themselves together\r\nfor the protection of their lives, homes and property. Those who joined\r\nthe vigilance committee took an oath to support the Government of the\r\nUnited States and Kansas, and to do all in their power to put down the\r\nrebellion, and also to keep secret all proceedings of the organization.\r\nThis committee did very effective work in bringing to punishment\r\nviolators of law and also in keeping the lawless bands of Jayhawkers and\r\nother thieves out of Atchison county.\r\n\r\nThe following “circular” has been unearthed by the author, and while it\r\nbears no date it apparently contained the constitution, by-laws, ritual\r\nand oath of these societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         “CIRCULAR TO OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n“Be extremely careful in the selection of your members. Admit no one who\r\nis not of good standing in the community, and whom you have not good\r\nreason to believe to be firm and uncompromising in his devotion to the\r\nUnion, and to be relied upon to assist in any emergency in maintaining\r\nthe laws and good order in the community. This is of the first and\r\nhighest importance to the order, and if any member shows symptoms of\r\ndefection, watch him closely.\r\n\r\n“In all cases, deal kindly with your opponents, and strive by gentle\r\nmeans to win them over to a change of sentiment. Many good men may thus\r\nbe brought within our circle who would otherwise be lost to us.\r\n\r\n“The first club established in your county seat will be called the\r\nCounty Club, to which all clubs in the county will report, and by those\r\nofficers all such clubs will be established.

Com. at —— the number of clubs and number of members in the\r\ncounty. These reports should be carefully sealed and addressed ——.\r\n\r\n“The officers of County Clubs will be supplied with a printed\r\nconstitution and ritual, and they will furnish officers of subordinate\r\nclubs copies of the same, with a strict injunction to secrecy.\r\n\r\n“All correspondence must be secret as possible; and in order that this\r\nmay be accomplished the monthly reports may consist only of the place,\r\ndate, number of clubs in the county and number of members.

Are you opposed to secession or dis-union?\r\n\r\n“2. Do you acknowledge that your first and highest allegiance is due to\r\nthe Government of the United States of America?\r\n\r\n“3. Are you willing to take such an oath of allegiance to the United\r\nStates of America?\r\n\r\n“4. Are you willing to pledge yourself to resist to the extent of your\r\npower, all attempts to subvert or overthrow the constitution of the\r\nUnited States, or the constitution of the State of Kansas?\r\n\r\n“Should the candidates answer affirmatively, the marshal, after\r\nrepeating to the president, will conduct them into the club room and\r\npresent them to the president, who shall then address the candidates as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen:—We rejoice that you have thus voluntarily come forward to\r\nunite yourselves with us. The cause we advocate is that of our country;\r\nbanded together for the purpose of perpetuating the liberties for which\r\nour fathers fought, we have sworn to uphold and protect them.\r\n\r\n“It is a strange and sad necessity which impels American citizens to\r\nband themselves together to sustain the constitution and the Union; but\r\nthe Government under which we live is threatened with destruction.\r\nWashington enjoined upon us that ‘the unity of the Government which\r\nconstitutes us one people is a main pillar in the edifice of our real\r\nindependence; the support of our tranquility at home, our peace abroad—\r\nof our safety, of our prosperity, of that very liberty which we so\r\nhighly prize.’ He charges that we should ‘properly estimate the immense\r\nvalue of our national Union to our collective and individual happiness;\r\nthat we should cherish a cordial, habitual and immovable attachment to\r\nit; accustoming ourselves to think and speak of it as the palladium of\r\nour political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with\r\njealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion\r\nthat it can in any event be abandoned.’\r\n\r\n“He tells us again that ‘to the efficiency and permanency of the Union,\r\na Government for the whole is indispensable. No alliances, however\r\nstrict between the parts, is an adequate substitute.’\r\n\r\n“It is to sustain this Government we are banded together, and for this\r\npurpose you are now required to take a solemn obligation.\r\n\r\n“Place your left hand on the National Flag and raise your right hand\r\ntoward Heaven; repeating after me:\r\n\r\n“We and each of us do solemnly swear in the presence of God and these\r\nwitnesses to support, protect and defend the constitution and Government\r\nof the United States and of the State of Kansas against all enemies,\r\nforeign and domestic, and to maintain and defend the Government of the\r\nUnited States and the flag thereof, and aid in maintaining the laws of\r\nthe United States in this State and to defend the State of Kansas\r\nagainst invasion from any State or States and from any other rebellion,\r\ninvasion, insurrection to the best of our ability without any mental\r\nreservation or evasion—So help us God.\r\n\r\n“The members will respond.\r\n\r\n“To this we pledge ourselves.\r\n\r\n“We do severally solemnly swear and affirm that we will protect, aid and\r\ndefend each member of all Union clubs, and will never make known in any\r\nway or manner, to any person or persons, not members of Union clubs, any\r\nof the signs, passwords, proceedings, purposes, debates or plans of this\r\nor any other club under this organization, except when engaged in\r\nadmitting new members into this organization.\r\n\r\n“The president will then deliver the following address to the\r\ncandidates:\r\n\r\n“‘The oath which you have now taken of your own free will and accord\r\ncannot rest lightly upon your conscience, neither can it be violated\r\nwithout leaving the stain of perjury upon your soul. Our country is now\r\nin “disorder” and “confusion;” the fires of commotion and contest are\r\nnow raging in our midst, war has come to us but we cannot, we must not,\r\nwe dare not omit to do that which in our judgment the safety of the\r\nUnion requires, not regardless of consequences, we must yet meet\r\nconsequences; seeing the hazard that surrounds the discharge of public\r\nduty, it must yet be discharged. Let us then, cheerfully shun no\r\nresponsibility justly devolving upon us here or elsewhere in attempting\r\nto maintain the Union. Let us cheerfully partake its fortune and its\r\nfate. Let us be ready to perform our appropriate part, whenever and\r\nwherever the occasion may call us, and to take our chances among those\r\nupon whom the blows may fall first and fall thickest.\r\n\r\n“‘Above all remember the words of our own immortal Clay: “If Kentucky\r\ntomorrow unfurls the banner of resistance, I never will fight under that\r\nbanner. I owe a paramount allegiance to the whole Union. A _subordinate_\r\none to my own State.”\r\n\r\n“‘Be faithful, then, to your country, for your interests are\r\nindissolubly connected with hers; be faithful to these, your brethren,\r\nfor your life and theirs may be involved in this contest; be faithful to\r\nposterity for the blessings you have enjoyed in this Government are but\r\nheld in trust for thee.’\r\n\r\n“Response by all the members—We Will!\r\n\r\n“The president will then present the constitution and oath to the\r\ncandidates for their signature.”\r\n\r\nCharles Metz, a notorious Jayhawker, whose personal appearance and\r\ncharacteristics are best described in an essay entitled, “The Last of\r\nthe Jayhawkers,” contributed to the old _Kansas Magazine_, by John J.\r\nIngalls. “Conspicuous among the irregular heroes who thus sprang to arms\r\nin 1861,” says Ingalls, “and ostensibly their leader, was an Ohio stage\r\ndriver by the name of Charles Metz, who having graduated with honor from\r\nthe penitentiary of Missouri, assumed for prudential reasons the more\r\neuphonious and distinguished appellation of ‘Cleveland.’ He was a\r\npicturesque brigand. Had he worn a slashed doublet and trunk hose of\r\nblack velvet he would have been the ideal of an Italian bandit. Young,\r\nerect and tall, he was sparely built and arrayed himself like a\r\ngentleman in the costume of the day. His appearance was that of a\r\nstudent. His visage was thin, his complexion olive tinted and colorless,\r\nas if ‘sicklied over with a pale cast of thought.’ Black piercing eyes,\r\nfinely cut features, dark hair and beard correctly trimmed, completed a\r\n_tout ensemble_ that was strangely at variance with the aspect of the\r\nscore of dissolute and dirty desperadoes that formed his command. These\r\nwere generally degraded ruffians of the worst type, whose highest idea\r\nof elegance in personal appearance was to have their mustaches a\r\nvillainous, metallic black, irrespective of the consideration whether\r\nits native hue was red or brown. * * * *\r\n\r\n“The vicinity of the fort with its troops rendered Leavenworth\r\nundesirable as a base of operations. St. Joseph was also heavily\r\ngarrisoned, and they accordingly selected Atchison as the point from\r\nwhich to move on the enemy’s works. Atchison at that time contained\r\nabout 2,500 inhabitants. Its business was transacted upon one street and\r\nextended west about four blocks from the river. Its position upon the\r\nextreme curve of the ‘Grand Detour of the Missouri, affording unrivaled\r\nfacilities to the interior in the event of pursuit. Having been\r\nprincipally settled by Southerners it still afforded much legitimate\r\ngain for our bird of prey, and its loyal population having already\r\nlargely enlisted, the city was incapable of organized resistance to the\r\ndepredations of the marauders.\r\n\r\n“They established their headquarters at the saloon of a German named\r\nErnest Renner, where they held their councils of war and whence they\r\nstarted upon their forays. The winter was favorable to their designs, as\r\nthe river closed early, enabling them to cross upon the ice. Cleveland\r\nproclaimed himself marshal of Kansas, and announced his determination to\r\nrun the country. He invited the cordial co-operation of all good\r\ncitizens to assist him in sustaining the government and punishing its\r\nfoes. Ignorant of his resources and of his purposes, the people were at\r\nfirst inclined to welcome their strange guests as a protection from the\r\ndangers to which they were exposed, but it soon became apparent that the\r\ndoctors were worse than the disease. They took possession of the town,\r\ndefied the municipal authorities, and committed such intolerable\r\nexcesses that their expulsion was a matter of public safety. Their\r\nincursions into Missouri were so frequent and audacious that a company\r\nof infantry was sent from Weston and stationed at Winthrop to effect\r\ntheir capture, but to no purpose. * * * * If a man had an enemy in any\r\npart of the country whom he wished to injure, he reported him to\r\nCleveland as a rebel, and the next night he was robbed of all he\r\npossessed and considered fortunate if he escaped without personal\r\nviolence. * * * * A small detachment of cavalry was sent from the fort\r\nto take them, but just as they had dismounted in front of the saloon and\r\nwere hitching their horses, Cleveland appeared at the door with a cocked\r\nnavy in each hand and told them that he would shoot the first man who\r\nmoved a finger. Calling two or three of his followers he disarmed the\r\ndragoons, took their horses and equipments and sent them back on foot to\r\nreflect upon the vicissitudes of military affairs. Early in 1862 the\r\ncondition became desperate and the city authorities, in connection with\r\nthe commander at Winthrop, concerted a scheme which brought matters to a\r\ncrisis. Cleveland and about a dozen of his gang were absent in Missouri\r\non a scout. The time of their return was known, and Marshal Charles\r\nHolbert had his force stationed in the shadow of an old warehouse near\r\nthe bank of the river. It was a brilliant moonlight night in mid-winter.\r\nThe freebooters emerged from the forest and crossed upon the ice. They\r\nwere freshly mounted and each one had a spare horse. Accompanying them\r\nwere two sleighs loaded with negroes, harness and miscellaneous plunder.\r\nAs they ascended the steep shore of the levee, unconscious of danger,\r\nthey were all taken prisoners except Cleveland, who turned suddenly,\r\nspurred his horse down the embankment and escaped. The captives were\r\ntaken to Weston, where they soon afterward enlisted in the Federal army.\r\nThe next day Cleveland rode into town, captured the city marshal on the\r\nstreet and declared his intention to hold him as a hostage for the\r\nsafety of his men. He compelled the marshal to walk by the side of his\r\nhorse a short distance, when finding a crowd gathering for his capture,\r\nhe struck him a blow on the head with his pistol and fled.”\r\n\r\nCleveland continued his exploits for a number of months after this, but\r\nwas finally captured in one of the southern counties where he was\r\nattempting to let himself down the side of a ravine. He was shot by a\r\nsoldier from above, and the ball entered his arm and passed through his\r\nbody. He was buried in St. Joseph. Mo., and a marble head stone over his\r\ngrave bears the following inscription, placed there by his widow: “One\r\nhero less on earth, one angel more in heaven.”\r\n\r\nAs the direct result of the operations of Cleveland and his gang, the\r\nspirit of lawlessness grew and the people finally “took the law into\r\ntheir own hands.” Perhaps the best account of the lynchings that\r\nfollowed was given by Hon. Mont. Cochran March 17, 1902, at the time a\r\nCongressman from Missouri, but formerly a leading citizen and county\r\nattorney of Atchison. Mr. Cochran said:\r\n\r\n“The thieves who fell victims to Judge Lynch, while not known as\r\nCleveland’s gang, operated extensively throughout the period of\r\nlawlessness in which no effort whatever was made to bring the outlaws to\r\njustice. After the Cleveland gang had been effectively broken up, these\r\ndepredatory scoundrels continued their operations. Their last crime, and\r\nthe one for which they were gibbeted, was the attempted robbery of an\r\nold man named Kelsey. He had received at Ft. Leavenworth $1,500 on a\r\nGovernment contract, and, upon returning home by the way of Atchison, he\r\ndeposited it in Hetherington’s bank. The thieves went to his house at\r\nnight and demanded the money. Of course, he could not produce it. They\r\ntortured the old man and his wife alternately for hours, and when after\r\nthe departure of the thieves, the neighbors were called in, Kelsey and\r\nhis wife were nearer dead than alive. The next morning hundreds of their\r\nneighbors, armed to the teeth, swarmed into Atchison. In Third street,\r\nnorth of Commercial, was a little log building, which had been the home\r\nof an early settler, in which was a gunsmith’s shop. Three or four of\r\nthe farmers went there to have their fire arms put in order. When they\r\ncame out one of them had a revolver in his hand. Two fellows standing\r\nby, seeing the farmers approaching, dived into an alley and started\r\nwestward at lightning speed. The farmers pursued and at the house of a\r\nnotorious character, known as Aunt Betsey, the fugitives were run to\r\ncover. The house was surrounded and they were captured. One of them was\r\nSterling, the fiddler and pianist of the bagnio. Other arrests followed\r\nuntil five were in durance. Then ensued probably the most extraordinary\r\nproceeding known to the annals of Judge Lynch. The mob took possession\r\nof the jail and the court house and for a week held them. The prisoners\r\nwere tried one by one. Sterling was convicted and executed. An elm tree,\r\nstanding on the banks of White Clay creek, in the southwest quarter of\r\nthe town, was admirably suited to the purpose. When the wagon, bearing\r\nSterling to his doom reached the ground the whole town was in\r\nattendance. A range of hills to the south swarmed with women. Asa\r\nBarnes, a prominent farmer, a man of iron resolution and unswerving\r\nhonesty, was the leader of the mob. With clinched teeth and blanched\r\nface he ordered Sterling to take his place on the seat of the wagon,\r\nand, while the desperado was as game as a peacock, he promptly obeyed.\r\nStanding on the wagon seat Sterling took off his hat, banged it down and\r\nplacing his foot on it, shook his clenched hand at the sea of upturned\r\nfaces, and with a volley of imprecations, said: ‘I am the best d—d man\r\nthat ever walked the earth and if you will drop me down and give me a\r\ngun, I will fight any ten of you.’ Sandy Corbin, a great bluffer, who\r\nbore but little better reputation than the man with the noose on his\r\nneck, pretended that he wanted to fight Sterling single-handed. Nobody\r\nelse paid any attention to Sterling’s ravings, and in a twinkling he was\r\nswung into eternity. The next day two others, a man named Brewer, a\r\nsoldier at home on a furlough, and a young fellow known as Pony, met the\r\nsame fate. There was much sympathy for Pony. He was a drunkard and all\r\nhis delinquencies were attributed to this weakness. Just as they were\r\nready to swing him up, two or three members of the mob told him that if\r\nhe would give information as to others implicated, but who had not been\r\narrested, they would save him. His reply was: ‘I went into this thing as\r\na man and I will die as a man.’ There was a stir among those nearest the\r\nwagon and it was discovered that an effort was being made to save the\r\nboy from death. The traces were cut and the horses led away. The effort\r\nfailed. Fifty men seized the wagon and dragged it away. The fourth to\r\nsuffer the vengeance of the mob was an old gray-haired man named Moody.\r\nAt the trial he strongly protested his innocence, and promised, if given\r\na respite of twenty-four hours, he would prove an alibi. This was\r\ngranted, but the witnesses were not forthcoming and the next day the old\r\nman was put to death. A priest visited him in jail, which was constantly\r\nsurrounded day and night, and when he came out after administering the\r\nrights of the church to the doomed man, it was remarked by those who saw\r\nhim that the priest was as pale as a ghost. The report gained currency\r\nthat when asked if Moody was innocent, he refused to answer yea or nay,\r\nand, although it had not then developed that Moody could not produce the\r\nwitnesses he promised, the conduct of the priest was taken as proof that\r\nMoody was guilty. During the week in which these extraordinary\r\nproceedings took place, the mob was in undisputed control of the court\r\nhouse and jail. Judge Lynch was perched upon the wool sack and a jury of\r\ntwelve men, who had qualified under oath, in the usual form, occupied\r\nthe jury box. Not the slightest effort at concealment was made by those\r\nwho led or those who followed. In my judgment no other course was left\r\nopen to the community.\r\n\r\n“Not less than 500 men were driven out of Kansas on the charge of\r\ndisloyalty in 1861 and 1862, with the approval of men of excellent\r\ncharacter, by thugs and scoundrels, who made no concealment of the fact\r\nthat they lived by horse stealing and house breaking. From the beginning\r\nof the Civil war until peace was declared, the Kansas border from the\r\nNebraska State line to the Indian Territory, was a scene of lawlessness\r\nand disorder. In the earlier years of the war, thieves regularly\r\norganized into companies, with captains whose authority was recognized\r\nby the rank and file, with headquarters in the towns and cities of\r\neastern Kansas, masqueraded as saviors of the Union, and upon the\r\npretense that they were serving the cause, thrived amazingly by\r\npillaging the farm houses and barns of neighboring counties in Missouri.\r\nAtchison was the headquarters of the Cleveland gang—the most active and\r\nthe boldest of the banditti. The gang did not hesitate to cross over to\r\nMissouri and steal horses, and returning to Atchison sell them in broad\r\ndaylight. Usually these raids were made at night, but there was no\r\nconcealment of the business they were engaged in, nor of the fact that\r\nhundreds of the horses sold by them were stolen from farmers of\r\nBuchanan, Platte and Clinton counties. In the capacity of saviors of the\r\nUnion, they took upon themselves the task of driving all persons\r\nsuspected of sympathy for ‘the lost cause’ out of Kansas. P. T. Abell,\r\nJ. T. Hereford, Headley & Carr, prominent lawyers, were notified to\r\nleave or they would be killed. They departed. Headley, Carr and Hereford\r\nserved in the Confederate army. Abell lived in exile until after the war\r\nwas over, and then returned to Atchison. He was one of the founders of\r\nthe town, and before the war was the partner of Gen. B. F. Stringfellow.\r\nTom Ray, proprietor of an extensive blacksmithing and wagon shop, was\r\nbanished. In a month or two he returned, but not until after he had\r\nhalted at Winthrop, a village opposite Atchison and opened up\r\nnegotiations which resulted in a grant of permission to remain in\r\nAtchison long enough to settle up his business and collect considerable\r\nsums due from his customers. He registered at the old Massasoit House,\r\nbut did not tarry long. Maj. R. H. Weightman, an early settler, who left\r\nAtchison in 1861, and accepted a colonel’s commission in the Confederate\r\narmy, had been killed at Wilson’s Creek. While sitting in the Massasoit\r\nHouse barroom, Ray was approached by Sandy Corbin, a somewhat notorious\r\ncharacter, who handled most of the horses stolen by Cleveland’s thieves.\r\nCorbin mentioned Weightman’s death, expressing satisfaction at his\r\nuntimely end, and applying all the epithets known to the abandoned, to\r\nthe dead man. Ray expostulated, and finally warned Corbin to desist or\r\nexpect a thrashing. Corbin rushed to his room and returned with two\r\nrevolvers, so adjusted upon his belt that Ray could not help seeing\r\nthem. Ray, who was a giant in size, seized Corbin, threw him face\r\ndownward upon a billiard table, and with a blacksmith’s hand as large as\r\na ham, spanked him until he was almost insensible. Then he hurriedly\r\nboarded the ferry boat, crossed the river and made his way to Montana,\r\nwhere he lived until his death, twenty years ago.\r\n\r\n“Cleveland’s lieutenant, a fellow named Hartman, was the worst of the\r\ngang, and was guilty of so many and such flagrant outrages upon the\r\nprominent citizens that in sheer desperation, four men, all of whom are\r\nnow dead, met and drew straws to see who would kill Hartman—(1) Jesse C.\r\nCrall, during his life prominent in politics and business; (2) George T.\r\nChalliss, for thirty years a deacon in the Baptist church and a\r\nprominent wholesale merchant and identified prominently with Atchison\r\naffairs; (3) James McEwen, a cattle buyer and butcher; (4) The fourth\r\nman was a prominent physician. Each of these had suffered intolerable\r\noutrages at the hands of Hartman. He had visited their houses and\r\nterrified their wives by notifying them that unless their husbands left\r\nAtchison within a specified period they would be mobbed. Even the\r\nchildren of two of the victims of persecution had been abused. They met\r\nat the physician’s office, and after a prolonged conference, at which it\r\nwas agreed that neither would leave until Hartman had been killed,\r\nproceeded to draw straws to see which would undertake the work. Crall\r\nheld the straws, McEwen drew the short straw and the job fell to his\r\nlot. Atchison is bisected by two or three brooks, one of which traverses\r\nthe northwest section of the town and runs into White Clay creek. This\r\nravine has very precipitous banks, and was crossed by several foot\r\nbridges. At the east approach of the bridge was a tall elm tree. McEwen\r\ntook his position under this tree, and awaited the appearance of\r\nHartman, who necessarily passed that way in going home at night. When\r\nHartman was half-way across the bridge, McEwen stepped out, dropped to\r\nhis knee, leveled a double-barreled shotgun and turned loose. He filled\r\nHartman with buckshot from his head to his heels, but strange to say,\r\nthe fellow did not die for months afterward. Had either of the others\r\ndrawn the fatal straw, no doubt Hartman would have been killed in broad\r\ndaylight, on the streets, but McEwen concluded to give the fellow no\r\nchance for his life.”\r\n\r\nThe First Kansas volunteer cavalry was the first regiment to be raised\r\nunder the call of President Lincoln May 8, 1861. It was mustered into\r\nthe service at Ft. Leavenworth June 3, 1861. George W. Deitzler, of\r\nLawrence, was colonel, and the following men from Atchison were\r\nofficers: George H. Faicheled, captain, Company C; Camille Aguiel, first\r\nlieutenant: Rinaldo A. Barker, second lieutenant; James W. Martin,\r\nsecond lieutenant of Company B. Within ten days of the date this\r\nregiment was mustered in, they received orders for active service. The\r\nregiment joined the army of General Lyon at Grand River, Mo., and on\r\nJuly 10 arrived at Springfield, where the force of General Sigel was\r\ngathered. The united forces of the rebels, under Price and McCullouch,\r\nwas concentrated at Wilson’s Creek, twelve miles from Springfield, and\r\nwas strongly entrenched there, where the initial engagement of the First\r\nKansas regiment took place. This regiment went into the engagement with\r\n644 men and officers, and lost seventy-seven killed and 333 wounded. The\r\nrebel forces were estimated to be 5,300 infantry, fifteen pieces of\r\nartillery, and 6,000 horsemen, with a loss of 265 killed, 721 wounded,\r\nand 292 missing. The Union forces numbered about 5,000, with a loss of\r\nabout 1,000. It was one of the fiercest and most determined battles of\r\nthe Civil war, and both officers and privates in the companies from\r\nAtchison displayed great bravery. First Lieut. Camille Aguiel was among\r\nthe killed, and privates Henry W. Totten and Casper Broggs, together\r\nwith Corporal William F. Parker, of Atchison, also lost their lives in\r\nthis engagement.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh regiment Kansas cavalry was ordered into active service\r\nimmediately following its organization. Colonel Daniel R. Anthony, of\r\nLeavenworth, was a lieutenant-colonel of this regiment, and among the\r\nline officers was William S. Morehouse, of Atchison, who was second\r\nlieutenant. This regiment saw a great deal of active service in the\r\nCivil war, and was first attacked by the rebels November 11, 1861, while\r\nencamped in western Missouri, on the Little Blue river. Following a\r\nfurious battle the regiment lost nine of its force by death and thirty-\r\ntwo wounded. This regiment subsequently participated in an engagement at\r\nLittle Santa Fe and at Independence. In January, 1862, the Seventh\r\nregiment went into camp at Humboldt, Kan., and remained there until it\r\nwas ordered to Lawrence in the following March, and subsequently was\r\nordered to Corinth, Miss., and from thence to Rienzi, Miss., where it\r\nwas assigned to the First Cavalry brigade, of which Phillip H. Sheridan\r\nwas commander, and subsequently saw much service in Tennessee and other\r\npoints in the South, and participated in the various actions that\r\noccurred during General Smith’s expedition to the Tallahatchee, after\r\nwhich the balance of their active service took place in Missouri. It was\r\nmustered out at Ft. Leavenworth September 4, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe Eighth regiment Kansas infantry was perhaps closer to the hearts of\r\nthe people of Atchison county than any other regiment that participated\r\nin the Civil war, for the reason that its lieutenant-colonel was the\r\nbeloved John A. Martin, editor of the _Atchison Champion_, and\r\nsubsequently governor of Kansas. It was originally recruited and\r\nintended for home and frontier service. The fear of invasion, both by\r\nhostile Indians on the west, and the rebels on the south and east, kept\r\nfear alive in the hearts of many residents of Kansas, and for this\r\npurpose it was deemed desirable to have a regiment of volunteer soldiers\r\nclose at hand. As originally organized, this regiment consisted of six\r\ninfantry and two cavalry companies, but various changes were made during\r\nthe three months following its organization. It saw active service\r\nthroughout the South, and participated in many of the important battles\r\nof the Civil war, but in none did it play a more conspicuous part than\r\nin the great battle of Mission Ridge. The following is from Colonel\r\nMartin’s official report of the part taken by the Eighth Kansas in this\r\nengagement:\r\n\r\n“Shortly after noon, on the twenty-fifth (November), we were ordered to\r\nadvance on the enemy’s position at the foot of Mission Ridge, and moved\r\nout of our works, forming in the second line of the battle. We at once\r\nadvanced steadily in line through the woods and across the open field in\r\nfront of the enemy’s entrenchments to the foot of the hill, subjected\r\nduring the whole time to a heavy artillery fire from the enemy’s\r\nbatteries, and as soon as we reached the open field, to a destructive\r\nmusketry fire. Reaching the first line of works we halted to rest our\r\nmen for a few moments, and then advanced through a terrible storm of\r\nartillery and musketry, to the foot of the hill and up it as rapidly as\r\npossible. The crest of the ridge at the point where we moved up was\r\nformed like a horseshoe. We advanced in the interior, while the enemy’s\r\nbatteries and infantry on the right and left, as well as in the center,\r\npoured upon us a most terrific fire. But the men never faltered or\r\nwavered, although from the nature of the ground, regiments were mingled\r\none with another, and company organization could not possibly be\r\npreserved. Each man struggled to be first on top, and the officers and\r\nmen of the regiment, without a single exception, exhibited the highest\r\ncourage and the most devoted gallantry in this fearful charge.\r\n\r\n“The enemy held their ground until we were less than a dozen yards from\r\ntheir breastworks, when they broke in wild confusion and fled in panic\r\ndown the hill on the opposite side. A portion of our men pursued them\r\nfor nearly a mile, capturing and hauling back several pieces of\r\nartillery and caissons, which the enemy were trying to run off.\r\n\r\n“We occupied the summit of Mission Ridge until the night of the twenty-\r\nsixth, when we were ordered to return to camp at Chattanooga.\r\n\r\n“Our loss was one commissioned officer wounded and three enlisted men\r\nkilled and thirty-one wounded. The regiment went into the battle with an\r\naggregate force of 217 men and officers.\r\n\r\n“Where all behaved with such conspicuous courage, it is difficult to\r\nmake distinction, but I cannot forebear mentioning my adjutant-\r\nlieutenant, Sol. R. Washer. Wounded at Chicakamauga, and not yet\r\nrecovered from the effects of his wound, and suffering from a severe\r\nsprain of the ankle, which prevented his walking, he mounted his horse\r\nand rode through the whole battle, always foremost in danger.”\r\n\r\nThe Eighth infantry remained in camp at Chattanooga until it removed to\r\nthe relief of Burnside at Knoxville, which city was reached on December\r\n7. About the same time Sherman’s corps arrived. The winter of 1863 was\r\nspent in east Tennessee, and in the following February arrived home in\r\nAtchison and Ft. Leavenworth. There was great rejoicing and celebration\r\nand both officers and soldiers were greeted with waving banners, ringing\r\nbells, booming cannon, and there was much feasting and speech making.\r\nThe regiment was home on a furlough, and early in April the men re-\r\nassembled at Leavenworth and on the twelfth of that month was ordered to\r\nreport back to Chattanooga, where it subsequently saw service in the\r\nCumberland mountains, and throughout the State of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nColonel Martin was mustered out at Pulaski November 17, his term of\r\nenlistment having expired, and the following day he left for the North,\r\nbut the regiment was not mustered out of service until the following\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nThe Tenth regiment, Kansas infantry, was made up of the Third and Fourth\r\nand a small portion of the Fifth Kansas regiments, and among its\r\nofficers were Mathew Quigg, captain of Company D; Seth M. Tucker, first\r\nlieutenant, and David Whittaker, second lieutenant, all of Atchison. The\r\nactivities of this regiment were largely confined to operations in\r\nMissouri and Arkansas, and afterwards in Tennessee. In December, 1864,\r\nit arrived at Clinton, Miss., without tents or blankets, and many of the\r\nmen without shoes or overcoats. During January it made an expedition\r\ninto Mississippi, and the latter part of that month marched to\r\nWaterloss, Ala., remaining there until February 8, when it embarked for\r\nVicksburg, where it remained until February 19, and subsequently\r\noperated around Mobile, and the men of this regiment were employed as\r\nskirmishers in the joint advance upon the fortifications around Mobile.\r\nIt was mustered out at Montgomery, Ala., September 20, 1865, and finally\r\ndischarged at Ft. Leavenworth, Kan. The regiment was mostly composed of\r\nveterans, who understood the life of a soldier, and realized the\r\nhardships of military campaigns. They did their duty, whether it was in\r\nguarding their own State from invasion, or assaulting the rebels at the\r\nsiege of Ft. Blakely.\r\n\r\nThe Thirteenth regiment, Kansas infantry, had more officers in it from\r\nAtchison than any of the regiments that participated in the Civil war.\r\nIt was raised under President Lincoln’s call of July, 1862, and was\r\nrecruited by Cyrus Leland, Sr., of Troy, Kan., by virtue of authority\r\nfrom James H. Lane, in the counties of Brown, Atchison, Doniphan,\r\nMarshall and Nemaha. The regiment was organized September 10, 1862, at\r\nCamp Staunton, Atchison, and mustered into the service ten days later.\r\nColonel of this regiment was Thomas M. Bowen, of Marysville, and the\r\nmajor was Caleb A. Woodworth, of Atchison. Among the line officers from\r\nAtchison were: Henry Havenkorst, captain of Company B; August\r\nLangehemeken, second lieutenant; Henry R. Neal, captain; Robert\r\nManville, second lieutenant; John E. Hayes, captain, Company F;\r\nArchimedes S. Speck, first lieutenant; William J. May, second\r\nlieutenant; Patrick McNamara, captain, Company K; Daniel C. O’Keefe,\r\nfirst lieutenant; Hugh Dougherty, second lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThe regiment joined a division of General Blunt soon after the battle of\r\nOld Ft. Wayne, and participated in various engagements in Arkansas. At\r\nthe battle of Prairie Grove, it was one of the first regiments to be\r\nengaged, and in every attempt to capture the battery of which this\r\nregiment formed the support at this battle, was successfully repulsed,\r\nwith heavy losses to the rebels. This battle virtually finished the\r\ncampaign for the winter. It subsequently did garrison and out-post duty\r\nin Arkansas, and in the Cherokee Nation. The regiment remained on duty\r\nat Ft. Smith, Ark., until March 3, 1865, when it was ordered to Little\r\nRock, Ark., and on June 26 of that year was mustered out of service.\r\n\r\nAmong the privates of this regiment from Atchison, who were killed,\r\nwere: James L. Parnell, of Mount Pleasant, and John Collins and Lorenzo\r\nRichardson, of Atchison.\r\n\r\nThomas Roe, a fine, stout young man, son of a widowed mother, of\r\nBrownsville, Pa., was the only member of Company D, of the Second Kansas\r\ncavalry, that lost his life in battle during its nearly four years of\r\nservice in the Civil war. This company participated in the battles of\r\nCane Hill and Prairie Grove, in Arkansas, and other engagements. Roe\r\ncame to Kansas with the late Thomas Butcher, for whom he worked until\r\ngoing into the war of the rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1861, a company of home guards was organized by Free State men,\r\nof Lancaster and Shannon townships, Atchison county, with a few from\r\nBrown and Doniphan counties, which gathered every Saturday afternoon for\r\ndrill, alternating at the homes of Johnson Wymore and Robert White.\r\nRobert White, who had received military training during the Mexican war,\r\nhaving served there in 1846–48, did most of the drilling. A. J. Evans\r\nwas captain; Robert White, first lieutenant; John Bertwell, of Brown\r\ncounty, was second lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThe pro-slavery people were also organized and drilling at the same\r\ntime, consisting of South Carolinians, Virginians and Missourians, who\r\nwere for the Confederacy and slavery.\r\n\r\nAt a Sunday school meeting on the prairie, held in a vacant settler’s\r\nshanty near Eden postoffice, where both sides in the neighborhood\r\nworshiped on Sundays, Robert White found out on a Sunday in August,\r\n1861, that a southern organization was to disarm all Free State men the\r\nfollowing Tuesday. His nearest neighbor and a good friend, also a\r\nsoutherner, thought White had found this out and came and visited him a\r\ngood part of Sunday afternoon and staying in the evening until after 10\r\no’clock before going home, White showing no excitement. Willis went\r\nhome, seemingly much at ease, but he was watched by his friend White\r\nuntil safely resting at his home, when White went and called another\r\nFree State man from his bed who notified half the Free State company and\r\nWhite the other half, causing them to meet early the following Monday,\r\nwhen by the middle of the afternoon of that day every pro-slavery man in\r\nthat part of the country had his fire arms taken from him, and before\r\nTuesday evening all of them had departed for Missouri.\r\n\r\nMost of the members of the Free State company enlisted in the following\r\nOctober as volunteers for three years’ service in the Union army and\r\nbecame known as Company D of Second Kansas cavalry. Robert White, who\r\nwas commissioned as first lieutenant in Company D, was discharged and\r\nsent home to die with a serious case of inflammatory rheumatism, but he\r\nrecovered so far that in 1863 he raised and drilled a company that\r\nbecame a part of the State militia. He was commissioned captain of this\r\ncompany and led it in the Price raid at the battle of Westport in 1864\r\nas a part of the regiment commanded by Col. L. S. Treat in helping keep\r\nCapt. White’s old brigade, commanded by Gen. Sterling Price, of the\r\nMexican war, from getting into Kansas. The late M. J. Cloyes and T. B.\r\nPlatt, of Atchison, were members of Captain White’s company in the Price\r\nraid. Platt was clerk of the company; John English was first lieutenant;\r\nW. F. Streeter, second lieutenant, and Francis Schletzbaum was first\r\nsergeant.\r\n\r\nThe Seventeenth regiment, Kansas infantry, was a negro regiment, but\r\nwith white officers. James M. Williams was colonel, and George J.\r\nMartin, of Atchison, was captain of Company B, and William G. White and\r\nLuther Dickinson, of Atchison, were first and second lieutenants. This\r\nregiment played an honorable part during all the Civil war, and its\r\nservice was largely confined to operations in Arkansas and Texas. It was\r\nmustered out of service at Pine Bluff, Ark., October 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe Second regiment, Kansas colored infantry, was organized in June,\r\n1863, at Ft. Smith, Ark., and among its line officers was First Lieut.\r\nJohn M. Cain, of Atchison. It conducted itself with conspicuous bravery\r\nwith the army of the frontier, and during the brief occupation of\r\nCamden, Ark., by General Steele’s forces, this regiment was employed on\r\npicket and forage duty. It showed conspicuous bravery around Poison\r\nSprings and Mark’s Mills, and under the able command of Col. Samuel J.\r\nCrawford, who subsequently became governor of Kansas, it won for itself\r\nan enviable name among the regiments from Kansas, who participated in\r\nthe Civil war. This regiment was finally discharged from the services at\r\nLeavenworth November 27, 1865, after having proved to the Nation the\r\nfidelity of the colored soldier.\r\n\r\nIt was in September, 1864, that General Sterling Price created great\r\nconsternation by an attempted invasion of Kansas, which ended in his\r\ndefeat on the border by the Union forces, aided by the Kansas State\r\nmilitia. At the time Price started north in his march through Arkansas\r\nand Missouri. Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis commanded the Department of\r\nKansas, which included Nebraska, Colorado and Indian Territory, in\r\naddition to Kansas. General Curtis had about 4,500 men, all of whom had\r\nbeen employed in protecting the frontiers of Kansas and Colorado, and\r\nthe overland mail route. At this time General Curtis was near Ft.\r\nKearney, operating against the Indians. On receipt of word announcing\r\nthe movements of General Price, General Curtis was recalled and reached\r\nKansas in September. A few days later he received word that 3,000 rebels\r\nwere marching on Ft. Scott, and advised Governor Carney to call the\r\nmilitia into service. At this time George W. Deitzler was major-general\r\nof the State militia; John T. Norton was assistant adjutant-general; R.\r\nA. Randlett, assistant quartermaster; Samuel S. Atwood, assistant\r\nquartermaster; Charles Chadwick, George T. Robinson, Lewis T. Welmorth,\r\nJohn J. Ingalls, Thomas White, Elijah G. Moore, H. Stein, and John A.\r\nLeffkler were all majors. Constant reports of a conflicting nature were\r\nspread from day to day, regarding the movements of General Price, but\r\nthe first point to be attacked was Pilot Knob, the engagement commencing\r\nSeptember 27 and lasting all day. General Ewing put up a vigorous\r\ndefense, with a force of about 1,000 men, while the militia commanders\r\nin Kansas made preparations for further resistance to the invasion of\r\nPrice. Meanwhile General Price continued to make headway, and on the\r\nfourth of October an order was issued forbidding the transit of boats\r\nbelow Kansas City. When it was discovered that the rebels under Price\r\nhad not been seriously checked in their movement westward, further\r\nefforts were made by General Curtis to prevail upon Governor Kearney to\r\ncall out the militia, which the Governor seemed disinclined to do.\r\nFinally, on October 9, 1864, Major General Deitzler issued an order for\r\nthe State militia from Doniphan, Brown, Nemaha and Marshall counties to\r\nrendezvous at Atchison, and the militia from other counties were ordered\r\nto other points in the State. A few days later Leavenworth was\r\nfortified, because of a telegram which was received from General\r\nRosecrans, stating that it was Price’s intention to strike that point\r\nfirst. The militia responded promptly, and the following regiments\r\nreported for service at Atchison: The Twelfth regiment, composed of 460\r\nmen, under the command of Col. L. S. Treat, and the Eighteenth regiment,\r\ncomposed of 400 men, under the command of Colonel Mathew Quigg. The\r\ntotal number of militia enrolled under the call of the governor was\r\n12,622, of which about 10,000 were south of the Kansas river at the\r\npoint most exposed to danger. From the eleventh until the sixteenth of\r\nthe month there was great excitement, as the forces rapidly gathered, to\r\nbe organized and equipped. On the staff of General Deitzler there were\r\ntwo men from Atchison: A. S. Hughes, an aide, and John J. Ingalls,\r\njudge-advocate, with the rank of major.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this determined move on the part of Gen. Sterling Price\r\nto invade Kansas, there followed in quick succession the battle of\r\nLexington, the battle of Big Blue, and finally the battle of Westport,\r\nat which, on October 23, 1864, the forces of Price were finally routed\r\nand his campaign and invasion were stopped, but not until it had caused\r\nthe citizens of Kansas, in addition to the labor and loss of life, not\r\nless than half a million dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                              NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\n  PIONEER TRANSPORTATION—EARLY FERRIES AND RATES—FAMOUS RIVER BOATS—\r\n      STEAMBOAT LINES TO ATCHISON—STEAMBOAT REGISTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlight reference has been made in the early narrative of this history to\r\npioneer transportation facilities, but the subject is one of so much\r\nimportance and of such immense interest, that a chapter devoted to it is\r\nthe only way in which it can be adequately treated.\r\n\r\nAt the time Atchison county was settled, railroad transportation by\r\nsteam was not a new thing, although it was in its primitive stages.\r\nNavigation of the inland waterways had reached rather a high state of\r\ndevelopment, and the matter of transportation then was just as essential\r\nto the purposes of civilization as in this day of the railroad and the\r\nautomobile, but it was many years before the steam railroads made the\r\nsteamboat traffic of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers obsolete. The\r\ntremendous subsidies granted by the Government in later years for\r\nrailroad building, however, and the splendid opportunity for piling up\r\nwealth in the projection of new railroads and the operation of them,\r\nwithout Governmental restrictions, together with the advantage of\r\nspeedier transportation facilities, completely overshadowed the\r\nsteamboat business, and as a result, our great inland waterway system\r\nhas grown into practical disuse. Shortly after Atchison county was\r\norganized, and the city of Atchison laid out, agitation was started for\r\nrailroad connections with the East. One of the first ordinances passed\r\nby the city council in 1858 provided for an election to submit a\r\nproposition to take $100,000.00 of stock in railroad. At that time the\r\nonly means of communication to the outside world Atchison had was by\r\nsteamboats to St. Louis. It was in October, 1855, that George M.\r\nMillion, Lewis Burnes, D. D. Burnes, James N. Burnes and Calvin F.\r\nBurnes commenced the operation of a ferry across the Missouri river.\r\nTheir dock on the Kansas side was at the foot of Atchison street. Their\r\ncharter was secured from the legislature under the terms of which a bond\r\nof $1,000.00 was required to insure the faithful performance of their\r\noperations. Although there was no public utilities commission in Kansas\r\nin 1855, the legislature took upon itself the task of fixing the rates\r\nto be charged by the ferry owners, in order that the public would not be\r\nrobbed. They were as follows:\r\n\r\n    Two-horse wagon, or wagon and one yoke of oxen (loaded)   $1.00\r\n    Two-horse wagon, or wagon and one yoke of oxen (unloaded)   .75\r\n    One additional pair of horses or  oxen                      .25\r\n    Loose cattle or oxen, per head                              .10\r\n    Sheep and hogs, per head                                    .05\r\n    Man and horse                                               .25\r\n    Foot passengers                                             .10\r\n    One horse and buggy or other vehicle                        .50\r\n    Two horse buggy or carriage                                 .75\r\n\r\nThe original promoters operated the ferry but a short time, and early in\r\nthe following year, they disposed of their interests to Dr. William L.\r\nChalliss, and his brother, Luther C. Challiss, and Willis E. Gaylord,\r\nand the ferry, under Dr. Challiss, and subsequent owners, continued in\r\noperation until 1875, when the present bridge was built.\r\n\r\nAbout the time the first ferry was established in Atchison, a number of\r\nSalt Lake freighters selected the town as a starting and outfitting\r\npoint and from that time until 1866, Atchison was the eastern terminus\r\nof many of the leading overland mail and freighting routes. It was the\r\nnatural location for communication with the West, as it was twelve miles\r\nfurther west in Kansas than any other point on the Missouri river.\r\nFreight and passengers were brought to the Atchison levee, at the foot\r\nof Commercial street, by a regular line of Packets plying between St.\r\nLouis and St. Joseph. It required eight days to make the round trip, and\r\nin the very early days, as many or four to six boats landed here in the\r\nbusy season.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months traffic on the river was practically suspended,\r\non account of the ice. These boats carried as many as 400 passengers,\r\nthe fare from St. Louis to St. Joseph ranging from $10.00 to $15.00,\r\nwhich included meals and state rooms. The cooking was said to have been\r\nvery fine, and the passengers always enjoyed the best that money could\r\nbuy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to passengers, these boats carried from 500 to 600 tons of\r\nfreight, and the rates were as high as $2.50 per cwt. on merchandise\r\nthat would not cost to exceed fifteen cents per cwt. in these days. The\r\ncrew consisted of 80 to 100 men, and the value of these boats was\r\nestimated to be about $45,000.00 each. The river then, as now, was\r\nfilled with sandbars and it required the greatest experience to pilot a\r\nboat safely to its destination, and as a result, experienced pilots\r\nwould command monthly salaries ranging from $250.00 to $500.00. Each\r\nboat carried two pilots. A. B. Symns, for many years a successful\r\nwholesale grocery merchant in Atchison, E. K. Blair, the miller, and\r\nGeorge W. Bowman, who also subsequently engaged in the grocery business,\r\nwere employees on several of the steamboats that landed at Atchison.\r\nStories of gambling and revelries, by day and by night, are not\r\nuncommon, and it is said it was not an unusual sight to see as many as\r\nten games of poker going on in the main cabins on every trip, in which\r\nreal money and not mere chips were used. Among the famous boats on the\r\nriver in the early days were the “Hesperian,” which burned near Atchison\r\nin 1859; the “Converse,” “Kate Kinney,” “Fort Aubrey,” “Morning Star,”\r\n“John D. Perry,” “Sioux City,” “Omaha,” “Carrier,” and the “James H.\r\nLucas,” which made the record run from St. Louis to St. Joseph,\r\nencompassing the trip in fifty-nine hours and twenty-two minutes, were\r\namong the well known boats that docked at the Atchison levee from time\r\nto time. The leading wharfmaster of the steamboat days was Mike Finney,\r\nwho was the father of Atchison’s present mayor (1915). James H. Garside\r\nsucceeded him and remained in the position until steamboat days had\r\npassed. Had the Missouri river been the beneficiary of the bounty of the\r\nGovernment, as the railroads were in that day, it would still be a\r\nsplendid auxiliary of our transportation system. The Missouri river, so\r\nfar as Atchison is concerned, is in the same condition it was in when\r\nMark Twain made an early trip on it from St. Louis to St. Joseph. In\r\n“Roughing It,” he said:\r\n\r\n“We were six days going from St. Louis to St. Joseph, a trip that was so\r\ndull and sleepy and eventless, that it has left no more impression on my\r\nmemory than if its duration had been six minutes instead of that many\r\ndays. No record is left in my mind now concerning it, but a confused\r\njumble of savage looking snags, which we deliberately walked over with\r\none wheel or the other; and of reefs which we butted and butted and then\r\nretired from, and climbed over in some softer place; and of sand bars\r\nwhich we roosted on occasionally and rested, and then got our crutches\r\nand sparred over. In fact the boat might as well have gone to St. Joseph\r\nby land, for she was walking most of the time anyhow—climbing over reefs\r\nand clambering over snags, patiently and laboriously all day long. The\r\ncaptain said she was a bully boat, and all she wanted was more “shear”\r\nand a bigger wheel. I thought she wanted a pair of stilts, but I had the\r\nsagacity not to say so.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                   STEAMBOAT LINES TO ATCHISON—1856.\r\n\r\n From _Squatter Sovereign_.\r\n\r\n March 11, 1856.\r\n\r\n     “A.

Twenty-four miles west of Atchison this road was\r\nintersected by the old overland mail trail from St. Joseph. Leavenworth\r\nhad laid out a new road west, over which it was planned to run the\r\nPike’s Peak Express stages in the spring of 1859, as well as the mule\r\nand ox teams, for Denver and the mountain mining camps. A branch road\r\nwas also opened to intersect this route from Atchison in the spring of\r\n1859, under the direction of Judge F. G. Adams. The expedition started\r\nwest from Atchison in the spring of that year, over what is now known\r\nand was then known as the Parallel road, then through Muscotah and\r\nAmerica City, across into the Big Blue river, near Blue Rapids, and\r\nwestward through Jewell county. The object of this expedition was to\r\nopen a shorter route to the mountains than the one opened by the\r\nLeavenworth company, and the route proposed did save sixty-five miles\r\ndistance, and almost twelve hours time. E. D. Boyd, an engineer,\r\nmeasured the entire distance from Atchison to Denver. He also made an\r\naccurate report, showing distances and the crossing of streams, and a\r\nbrief description of the entire route, which was published in the\r\n_Atchison Champion_, in June, 1859. According to that report, the\r\ndistance from Atchison to Denver was 620 miles. But notwithstanding the\r\nadvantage of this new road, it was abandoned immediately and never\r\ntraveled by ox or mule trains out of Atchison, for the reason that the\r\nold military road by Fort Kearney and along the Platte river enjoyed\r\nGovernment protection from the Indians, and was settled at intervals\r\nalmost the entire distance.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of overland freighting on the plains, more trains left\r\nAtchison than any other point on the river. The leading firms engaged in\r\nthe freighting business were, Stevens & Porter; Dennison & Brown;\r\nHockaday-Burr & Company; J. S. Galbraith: George W. Howe; Brown\r\nBrothers; E. K. Blair; I. N. Bringman; Roper & Nesbitt; Harrison\r\nBrothers; Henry Reisner; J. C. Peters; P. K. Purcell; R. E. Wilson; Will\r\nAddoms; George I. Stebbins; John C. Bird; William Home; Amos Howell;\r\nOwen Degan, and a number of others.\r\n\r\nThe cost of shipping merchandise to Denver was very high, as everything\r\nwas carried by the pound, rather than by the hundred pounds rate. Flour,\r\nbacon, molasses, whiskey, furniture and trunks were carried at pound\r\nrates. The rates per pound on merchandise shipped by ox or mule wagons\r\nfrom Atchison to Denver prior to 1860, were as follows:\r\n\r\n                          Flour      9  cents\r\n                          Tobacco   12½ cents\r\n                          Sugar     13½ cents\r\n                          Bacon     15  cents\r\n                          Dry goods 15  cents\r\n                          Crackers  17  cents\r\n                          Whiskey   18  cents\r\n                          Groceries 19½ cents\r\n                          Trunks    25  cents\r\n                          Furniture 31  cents\r\n\r\nIt has been said by those who witnessed the tremendous overland traffic\r\nof the late fifties and the early sixties, that those of this generation\r\ncan form no conception of the enormous amount of traffic overland there\r\nwas in those days. Trains were being constantly outfitted not only at\r\nAtchison, but at other points along the river. Twenty-one days was about\r\nthe time required for a span of horses or mules to make the trip to\r\nDenver and keep the stock in good condition. It required five weeks for\r\nox trains to make the same distance, and to Salt Lake, horses and mules\r\nwere about six weeks making the trip, and ox trains were on the road\r\nfrom sixty-five to seventy days. It was the ox upon which mankind\r\ndepended in those days to carry on the commerce of the plains. They were\r\nthe surest and safest for hauling a large part of the freight destined\r\nfor the towns and camps west of the Missouri river. Next in importance\r\nto the ox, was the mule, because they were tough and reliable, and could\r\nendure fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe year of 1859 was a big year in the history of Atchison, for in that\r\nyear the percentage of the growth of the town was greater than any other\r\nyear in its history. The fact that it was the best point on the Missouri\r\nriver for the overland staging and freighting outfits, brought it in\r\ngreater commercial prominence. At that time, Irwin & McGraw were\r\nprominent contractors, who were supplying the various military posts on\r\nthe frontier. The mere fact that these Government trains were started\r\nfrom Atchison, gave the town wonderful prestige.\r\n\r\nIt was nothing unusual to see two or three steamboats lying at the\r\nlevee, discharging freight, and as many more in sight either going up\r\nthe river from St. Louis, or down the river from St. Joe. It was not\r\nuncommon for a boat to be loaded at Pittsburgh, Pa., or Cincinnati,\r\nOhio, going down the Ohio river and up the Mississippi and Missouri to\r\nAtchison; it was not an unusual sight to see a whole boat load of wagons\r\nand ox yokes, mining machinery, boilers and other material necessary for\r\nthe immense trade of the West.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the traffic out of Atchison to the West was over the\r\nMilitary road, along the south bank of the Platte, and along this road\r\nteams of six to eight yoke of cattle, hauling heavily loaded wagons, and\r\nstrings of four or six horse or mule teams, formed almost an endless\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nThe liveliest period of overland trade extended from 1859 to 1866,\r\nduring which time there was on the plains and in the mountains an\r\nestimated floating population of 250,000. The greater majority of the\r\npeople on the plains produced but few of the necessities of life, and\r\nconsequently they had to be supplied from the Missouri river. During the\r\nclosing year of the Civil war, the travel was immense, most of the\r\nemigration going into the gold mining camps of the Northwest.\r\n\r\nWhile there was considerable freighting out of Atchison to the West\r\nfollowing the opening of the Territory, overland staging did not reach\r\nits height until 1861. The era of overland staging from the Missouri\r\nriver to the Pacific coast lasted altogether about eight years. The\r\nfirst great overland staging enterprise started in 1858, on what is\r\nknown as the Southern or Butterfield route. This route ran from St.\r\nLouis and Memphis, Tenn., intersecting at Ft. Smith, Ark. After being in\r\noperation for nearly three years, the route was succeeded by a daily\r\nline on the Central route, which ran from the Missouri river five years,\r\nfirst starting at St. Joseph, Mo., July 1, 1861, and then from Atchison\r\nin September of that year. On the Central route, the through staging\r\ncame to a close after the completion of the Union Pacific railroad from\r\nOmaha across the continent. Originally the stage enterprise was known as\r\nthe Overland Mail Company—the Southern or Butterfield line. After it was\r\ntransferred north and ran in connection with the stages to Denver, it\r\nwas known as the Central Overland California and Pike’s Peak Express\r\nCompany. After passing into the hands of Ben Holladay, it became the\r\nOverland Stage Line, and finally the name was changed to the Holladay\r\nOverland Mail Express Company. In 1866, the line had been consolidated\r\nwith the Butterfield Overland Dispatch, a stage company which was\r\norganized in 1865, with headquarters in Atchison.\r\n\r\nAtchison’s importance as an overland staging terminus was fixed by\r\nreason of an order of the United States Postoffice Department. Before\r\nthe final change, making Atchison headquarters and starting point for\r\nthe mail, the road from Atchison westward intersected the road from St.\r\nJoseph at Kennekuk. The distance from Atchison to Kennekuk was twenty-\r\nfour miles, while it was about thirty-five miles from St. Joseph, and\r\nconsequently there was a saving of about nine miles in favor of\r\nAtchison. This was an important item, in carrying the mails, and\r\nresulted in the order of the Postoffice Department making Atchison the\r\nstarting point. The distance by the overland stage line from Atchison to\r\nPlacerville was 1,913 miles, and following the abandonment of the\r\nButterfield or Southern route, it became the longest and the most\r\nimportant stage line in America. There were 153 stations between\r\nAtchison and Placerville, located about twelve and one-half miles apart.\r\nThe local fare was $225.00, or about twelve cents per mile, and as high\r\nas $2,000.00 a day was frequently taken in at the Atchison office for\r\npassenger fare alone. The fare between Atchison and Denver was $75.00,\r\nor a little over eight cents per mile, and to Salt Lake City, $150.00.\r\nLocal fares ran as high as fifteen cents per mile. Each passenger was\r\nallowed twenty-five pounds of baggage. All in excess of that was charged\r\nat the rate of $1.00 per pound. During the war, the fare to Denver was\r\nincreased from seventy-five dollars to $100.00, and before the close of\r\nthe war, it had reached $175.00 or nearly twenty-seven cents per mile.\r\n\r\nIt required about 2,750 horses and mules to run the stage line between\r\nAtchison and Placerville. It required, in addition to the regular supply\r\nof horses to operate the stages, some additional animals for\r\nemergencies, and it was estimated that the total cost of the horses on\r\nthis stage line was about one-half million dollars. The harness was the\r\nfinest that could be made, and cost about $150.00 for a complete set of\r\nfour, or about $55,000.00 for the whole line. The feeding of the stock\r\nwas one of the big items of expense, and there were annually consumed at\r\neach station from forty to eighty tons of hay, at a cost of $15 to $40\r\nper ton. Each animal was apportioned an average of twelve quarts of corn\r\nevery day, which cost from two to ten cents a pound. In the Salt Lake\r\nand California divisions, oats and barley, grown in Utah, were\r\nsubstituted for corn, but which cost about the same.\r\n\r\nThere were about 100 Concord coaches which, in the early sixties cost\r\nabout $1,000.00 each. The company owned about one-half of the stations,\r\nin addition to thousands of dollars’ worth of miscellaneous property, at\r\ndifferent places along the route. There were superintendents, general\r\nand local attorneys, paymasters and division agents, all of whom drew\r\nbig salaries. Among the stage company’s agents in the late fifties and\r\nearly sixties were Hugo Richards and Paul Coburn, at Atchison; Robert L.\r\nPease, of Atchison, was also for a time agent at Denver.\r\n\r\nThe mail was carried from Atchison west by Forts Kearney, Laramie and\r\nBridges, once a week. The schedule time from the river to Salt Lake City\r\nwas about eighteen days, and the distance was about 1,200 to 1,300\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 a daily overland mail was established out of Atchison, and with\r\nthe exception of a few weeks in 1862, 1864 and 1865, on account of\r\nIndian troubles, the overland was in operation and ran stages daily out\r\nof Atchison for about five years. It was the greatest stage line in the\r\nworld, carrying mail, passengers and express. It was also regarded as\r\nthe safest and the fastest way to cross the plains, and the mountain\r\nranges. It was equipped with the latest modern four and six horse and\r\nmule Concord coaches, and the meals at the eating stations along the\r\nroute were first-class, and cost from fifty cents to $2.00 each.\r\n\r\nWhen Atchison was selected as the starting place for the overland mail,\r\nit was not certain how long it would remain the eastern terminus of the\r\nmail route. The Civil war was at its height, and the rebels were doing\r\nmuch damage to the Hannibal & St. Joseph railroad, which had been\r\nconstructed in 1859. They tore up the track, burned the bridges,\r\ndestroyed the culverts, fired into the trains, and placed obstructions\r\nalong the roadbed, frequently delaying the mail from two to six days. As\r\na result of this condition of affairs, it was feared that Atchison would\r\nlose the overland mail, and the Government would change the starting\r\npoint to some town further north, but because of the advantageous\r\ngeographical position of Atchison, it was decided that it would be\r\ndisastrous to make a change, so the Government placed a large number of\r\ntroops along the entire line of the Hannibal & St. Joe, to insure the\r\nsafety of the mails, and Atchison continued to be the point of departure\r\nfor the overland mail, until 1866.\r\n\r\nThe stage coaches used by the overland line were built in Concord, N. H.\r\nThey carried nine passengers inside, and one or two could ride on the\r\nbox by the driver. Some of the stages were built with an extra seat\r\nabove and in the rear of the driver, so that three additional persons\r\ncould ride there, making fourteen, with the driver. Sometimes an extra\r\nman would be crowded on the box, making as many as fifteen persons, who\r\ncould ride on the Concord coach without very much inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThis chapter on overland staging would be unfinished, unless some\r\nreference was made to Ben Holladay, who played such an important part in\r\nthe overland staging days of this country. Ben Holladay had a remarkable\r\ncareer. In his early days, when he resided in Weston, Mo., he drove a\r\nstage himself. He was a genuine westerner, having run a saloon and\r\ntavern in Weston as early as 1838 and 1839. He went overland to\r\nCalifornia in 1849, and took a train to Salt Lake City with $70,000\r\nworth of goods. He spent some time in Utah, where he made considerable\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nBesides operating the Overland Stage for over five years, Holladay had\r\nother important interests in the West. Among his enterprises was a fleet\r\nof passenger steamers, plying between San Francisco and Portland, Ore.\r\nAt the height of his career he was a millionaire, and few men in the\r\ncountry accumulated wealth more rapidly. He spent his money freely, and\r\nsquandered vast sums when he was making it. After he had accumulated a\r\nfortune, he went to New York to live, and built a most pretentious\r\nresidence a few miles out of New York, on the Hudson river, which he\r\ncalled Ophir Farm. After he was awarded some good mail contracts by the\r\nGovernment, he built a mansion in Washington, which he furnished\r\nsuperbly, and collected a large classical library, with handsomely bound\r\nvolumes, and also was a patron of art, collecting fine oil paintings of\r\ncelebrated masters in Europe and America. He also made a collection of\r\nfine bronzes and statuary, and paid $6,000.00 each for two bronze lions.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1860 that he came into possession of the Central Overland\r\nCalifornia Mail Line, but subsequent trouble with the Indians damaged\r\nhis property to the extent of a half million dollars. His stage stations\r\nwere burned, and his stock stolen, and stage coaches destroyed. Finally,\r\nin 1888, being broken in health and in debt, his Washington home, with\r\nits contents, was sold under the hammer.\r\n\r\nHe came into possession of practically all the big overland routes by\r\npurchase and foreclosure of mortgages, and he made his vast fortune in\r\nmail contracts from the Government. He remained at the head of the\r\noverland line for about five years, taking possession of it in December,\r\n1861, and disposing of it, including the stations, rolling stock and\r\nanimals, in the latter part of 1866, to Wells Fargo & Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Holladay died in August, 1877, in Portland, Ore., a poor man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    BUTTERFIELD’S OVERLAND DISPATCH.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting promoters in overland staging days was D. A.\r\nButterfield. He came to Atchison from Denver in 1864, and engaged in the\r\ncommission business in a large stone warehouse near the Massasoit House,\r\nand, in addition to his commission business, he was agent for a line of\r\npackets plying between St. Louis and Atchison. Shortly after his arrival\r\nin Atchison he began the development of an overland stage line, which\r\nsubsequently reached very large proportions. His ambition was to be at\r\nthe head of an overland stage line, and, having selected what was known\r\nas the Smoky Hill route along the Kansas and Smoky Hill rivers, which\r\nwas fifty miles shorter than any other route to Denver, he proceeded\r\nwith the further development of his plans. He was a smart, capable,\r\nambitious and aggressive fellow, with vim, and was in touch with a\r\nnumber of men of large means in New York, whom he soon interested in his\r\nenterprise. Early in 1865 the following advertisement appeared in the\r\n_Atchison Daily Free Press_, announcing Mr. Butterfield’s project:\r\n\r\n                   “BUTTERFIELD’S OVERLAND DISPATCH.\r\n\r\n     “To all points in Colorado, Utah, Idaho and Montana Territory.\r\n  Principal office, Atchison, Kansas. New York Office No. 1 Vesey St.\r\n                              Astor House.\r\n\r\n  “Through bills of lading given from New York, Boston, Philadelphia,\r\n         Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis, and Burlington, Iowa.\r\n\r\n           “D. A. Butterfield, Proprietor, Atchison, Kansas.\r\n\r\n               “A. W. Spalding, General Agent, New York.”\r\n\r\nButterfield’s consuming desire was to control the big end of the\r\ntransportation business across the plains. He maintained an expensive\r\noffice in New York City and called his line “The Butterfield Overland\r\nDispatch.” Conspicuous signs were displayed over the doors of his office\r\nin the Astor House, showing caravans of great covered wagons drawn by\r\nmules and oxen, which signs attracted the attention of all. During his\r\npromotion of this new stage line Butterfield lived in great style and\r\nelegance in Atchison, in a house, the remains of which still stand\r\n(1915) at the southwest corner of Fifth and S streets. He entertained\r\nlavishly, and “champagne flowed like water” at his home when he gave a\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThe direct route out of Atchison to Denver, chosen by Butterfield, was\r\nin a southwesterly direction to Valley Falls, thence across the plains\r\nto a point on the old Fort Riley military road a few miles northeast of\r\nTopeka. The Butterfield line was first operated with mules and oxen, but\r\nas the road grew more prosperous, four horse stages were substituted.\r\n“Dave” Butterfield, as he was known, was determined to make Ben Holladay\r\na pigmy in the overland stage business. Although it was known to many\r\nthat there was more wind behind his enterprise than real money, yet in\r\nspite of the fact that his efforts in the staging world were more or\r\nless looked upon as a promotion scheme, he interested considerable\r\ncapital, including the United States, American and the Adams Express\r\ncompanies. He was a great believer in publicity and spent large sums in\r\nnewspaper advertising, but it required much money to properly equip and\r\noperate a stage line, and Butterfield did not have enough. In\r\nconsequence of his lack of capital, his original company failed, but was\r\nsubsequently reorganized in June, 1865. Butterfield, undaunted, went\r\neast again and raised more money, and before his return, he capitalized\r\na new company with $3,000,000.00, with one-half paid in. Branch offices\r\nwere opened in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Cincinnati,\r\nChicago, Atchison, Leavenworth, Denver and Salt Lake City. John A.\r\nKinney, a pioneer business man of Atchison, who had been connected with\r\nButterfield from the beginning, continued in charge of the Atchison\r\noffice under the reorganization, with a salary of $2,500 per year.\r\nShortly after the new company was organized, Butterfield inserted\r\nanother advertisement in the _Free Press_, as follows:\r\n\r\n                   “BUTTERFIELD’S OVERLAND DISPATCH.\r\n\r\n  “To all points in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,\r\n  Montana and the state of Nevada.\r\n\r\n  “Contracts can be made with this Company through their Agents to\r\n  transport freight from all the eastern cities to all localities in\r\n  the Territories, the rate to include railroad and overland carriage\r\n  and all commissions upon the Missouri River. The Company owns its\r\n  own transportation and gives a through bill of lading which protects\r\n  shipper from extreme East to the Far West.\r\n\r\n                          “EXPRESS DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n  “About August, 1865 the Company will have a line of express coaches\r\n  running daily between Atchison, Kansas and Denver, Colorado; and\r\n  about September 1st, to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and as soon in the\r\n  Spring as possible, a tri-weekly between Denver and Salt Lake City\r\n  over which merchandise will be carried at fair express rates.\r\n\r\n                    “TIME TO DENVER—EIGHT (8) DAYS.\r\n\r\n  “INSTRUCTIONS: Mark goods for cattle and mule trains: ‘But’d Ov’d\r\n  Desp’h.’ Mark goods for express: B. O. D. Express, Atchison.”\r\n\r\nSome changes were afterwards made in the location of the route, but it\r\nleft as before, in a southwesterly direction to Valley Falls. The\r\nbusiness of the new company was very large from the start and grew\r\nrapidly. Steamboats discharged great quantities of freight at the\r\nAtchison levee for shipment by Butterfield’s line. A large amount also\r\ncame from St. Joseph by railroad. In one day during July, 1865, nineteen\r\ncar loads of freight consigned to the Butterfield line at Atchison were\r\nreceived for transportation across the plains. In the following month a\r\ntrain was loaded with 600,000 pounds of merchandise for Salt Lake City.\r\nOne of the early stages that left Atchison on this line made the run to\r\nJunction City, which was 119 miles, in less than twenty-four hours, or\r\nat the rate of five and one-half miles an hour, including all stops, but\r\nthe reorganized Butterfield line was not long in operation before it met\r\nwith many obstacles. The fact that the Smoky Hill route selected by\r\nButterfield was not guarded by Government troops of soldiers, as the\r\nFort Kearney route was, caused the Indians to make many raids upon the\r\noverland trains. A number of severe encounters with Indians were had\r\nfrom time to time, until it became necessary to operate the stages with\r\na mounted guard in advance. It finally became so dangerous that it was\r\ndifficult to secure messengers and drivers to operate the line. This\r\ncondition became so serious that the “Overland Dispatch,” which in the\r\nmeanwhile was becoming more financially embarrassed from day to day, was\r\nfinally obliged to retire from the field. During the short time that it\r\nlasted, it was widely known throughout the western country, and in the\r\nEast it was known in most of the leading cities. While this company, to\r\nsome extent, cut down the receipts of the Holladay line, traffic across\r\nthe plains had become so dull in the sixties that there was not much\r\nprofit in it for anybody. In March, 1866, Holladay took over the\r\nButterfield line and the following announcement appeared in the\r\nnewspapers:\r\n\r\n                                “NOTICE.\r\n\r\n“To the Employees of the Overland Dispatch Company.\r\n\r\n  “The Overland Stage Line and the Overland Dispatch Company have\r\n  become one property under the name of the Holladay Overland Mail &\r\n  Express Company.\r\n\r\n  “The new Company guarantees payment to the employees of the late\r\n  Overland Dispatch Company. An agent is now en route from New York to\r\n  pay them.\r\n\r\n                      “David Street, Gen’l Agt.,\r\n                      “Holladay Mail & Express Co.\r\n\r\n  “Atchison, Kansas, March 17, 1866.”\r\n\r\nThe business that Butterfield had worked up was continued by the new\r\ncompany, but Butterfield was hopelessly down and out. While in the midst\r\nof what appeared to be a prosperous freight business with many tons of\r\nponderous mining machinery in transit across the plains to the mining\r\ncamps of Colorado, the mining bubble broke, and great difficulty was\r\nexperienced in collecting freight bills that were accumulating on\r\nmachinery that was being transported across the plains, so it was\r\nunloaded upon the plains and there it was left to rust out. In less than\r\neighteen months from the first organization of the Overland Dispatch,\r\nButterfield was a financial wreck, and the consolidation of his company\r\nwith the Holladay line was the only action that could be taken to\r\nconserve the property which the Butterfield line had acquired.\r\nButterfield subsequently left Atchison and located in Mississippi, where\r\nhe organized a railroad, which also proved a failure. He left\r\nMississippi for Arkansas and built and operated a horse car line in Hot\r\nSprings. He finally got into a quarrel with one of his employees, who\r\nstruck him with a neck yoke, from the effects of which he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OTHER ROUTES.\r\n\r\nAtchison was an important point for stage routes as early as 1859. There\r\nwas a line of hacks which ran daily from Atchison to Leavenworth, and\r\nanother to Lawrence, and still another by Oskaloosa and Valley Falls\r\nacross the Kansas river to Lecompton, Big Springs, Tecumseh and Topeka.\r\nTo reach Lawrence from Atchison in those days, passengers were compelled\r\nto go by Leavenworth, until a line was opened by Mount Pleasant and\r\nOskaloosa, reducing the distance to forty-five miles, and the fare to\r\n$4.50. There was a line north to Doniphan, Troy, Highland and Iowa\r\nPoint. A line was also operated by Doniphan to Geary City, Troy and St.\r\nJoseph, and still another ran by Hiawatha to Falls City, Neb. The most\r\nimportant route, which had its headquarters at that time in Atchison,\r\nwas a four mule line. The Central Overland California and Pike’s Peak\r\nExpress, which with its speedy Concord stages, crossed the plains twice\r\na week. This was the Holladay line. The Kansas Stage Company operated a\r\nline to Leavenworth, which made stops at Sumner and Kickapoo. A daily\r\nline, operated by the Kansas Stage Company, ran to Junction City by way\r\nof Mount Pleasant, Winchester, Osawkie, Mt. Florence, Indianola, Topeka,\r\nSilver Lake, St. Marys, Louisville, Ogden and Ft. Riley. The distance\r\nover this route was 120 miles and the fare was $10.00. There was also a\r\ntwo-horse stage line carrying the mail from Atchison to Louisville, Kan.\r\nLouisville was one of the most important towns in Pottawatomie county,\r\nand in 1859 was an important station on the route of the Leavenworth &\r\nPike’s Peak Express. The mail line as then operated ran through\r\nMonrovia, Arrington, Holton and other points to its destination in the\r\nWest. J. H. Thompson, who was an old man then, was the contractor for\r\ncarrying the mail and was well known along the whole route, being\r\nfamiliarly known as “Uncle Johnny” Thompson. His stage left Atchison\r\nevery Saturday morning at 8 o’clock and arrived from Louisville on\r\nFriday evening at 6. The fare from Atchison to Louisville was $8.00.\r\n\r\n            “ST.

They\r\nbecame used to it, the same as we have this day been accustomed to the\r\ndaily arrival and departure of trains, but it was a gloomy day for\r\nAtchison when “the overland” finally pulled out of the town for good,\r\nafter having run its stages out of the city almost daily for five years.\r\nThe advance of the Union Pacific railroad from Omaha west along the\r\nPlatte to Ft. Kearney, and the completion of the Kansas Pacific railway\r\nwas the cause of the abandonment of Atchison by the “overland” as a\r\npoint of departure for the mail. The company for many weeks before its\r\nfinal departure had been taking both stock and coaches off of the\r\neastern division from the Missouri river to Rock creek, and other steps\r\nin preparation for moving the point of departure further west were\r\ntaken. It was a little after 11 o’clock in the morning of December 19,\r\n1866, that the long train of Concord stages, express coaches, hacks and\r\nother rolling stock started from their stables and yards on Second\r\nstreet to leave Atchison forever. The procession went west out of\r\nAtchison along Commercial street. Alex Benham and David Street, both\r\nfaithful employees of “The Overland,” were in charge of the procession\r\nand they rode out of town in a Concord buggy. Other employees followed\r\nin buggies and coaches, and then the canvas covered stages, followed by\r\nover forty teams and loose horses, slowly moved out of town, headed for\r\nFort Riley and Junction City.\r\n\r\n                          ROUTE FROM ATCHISON\r\n                                via the\r\n                         SMOKY HILL FORK ROUTE.\r\n\r\n From Atchison to  Miles Total                  Remarks\r\n Mormon Grove         3½       Junction of the Great Military Road.\r\n Monrovia             8½    12 Provisions, entertainment and grass.\r\n Mouth of Bill’s      13    25 On the Grasshopper, wood and grass.\r\n   Creek\r\n Ter.

JOSEPH—THE FIRST TELEGRAPH—MODERN\r\n      TRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEight years before the last stage pulled out of Atchison the agitation\r\nfor a railroad began. The first charter provided for the construction of\r\na railroad from Atchison to St. Joseph. As appeared in an earlier\r\nchapter, the city council of Atchison at its first meeting called an\r\nelection March 15, 1858, to vote on a proposition to subscribe for\r\n$100,000 in stock. The election was held in the store of the Burnes\r\nBrothers, and S. H. Petefish, Charles E. Woolfolk and Dr. C. A. Logan\r\nwere judges of election. The proposition carried almost unanimously,\r\nand, in addition to the stock subscribed for by the city, the citizens\r\nof the town subscribed for $100,000 in stock individually. The following\r\nMay the contract for the construction of the road was awarded to\r\nButcher, Auld & Dean at $3,700 per mile. There were fourteen other\r\nbidders. The members of the firm which made the successful bid were:\r\nEphraim Butcher, David Auld, James Auld and William Dean. Work of\r\nconstruction was started May 12, 1858, but was not finished until\r\nFebruary 22, 1860. The completion of this road to Atchison was of very\r\nfar reaching importance. The town was wild with excitement, for the new\r\nrailroad gave the town its first direct rail connection with the east.\r\nIts terminus at Winthrop (East Atchison) was the first western point\r\neast of the Rocky mountains reached by a railroad at that time in the\r\nUnited States, save one. The first railroad built between the\r\nMississippi and the Missouri rivers was the Hannibal & St. Joseph, which\r\nwas completed to St. Joseph February 23, 1859, and the new railroad from\r\nAtchison connected with the Hannibal & St. Joseph at the latter point.\r\n\r\nRichard B. Morris was the first conductor of the Atchison road, and he\r\nsubsequently became internal revenue collector of Kansas under\r\nCleveland. Following the completion of the road, a great celebration was\r\nheld at Atchison June 13, 1860, and the people not only celebrated the\r\ncompletion of the St. Joseph line, but also the breaking of ground on\r\nthe Atchison & Pike’s Peak railroad, now the Central Branch. Great\r\npreparations were made for the celebration weeks in advance and promptly\r\nfollowing the hour of 12 o’clock on the morning of June 13, 1860, the\r\nfiring of 100 guns at intervals began, which was kept up with monotonous\r\nregularity until daybreak. Flags and bunting fluttered from poles and\r\nwindows throughout the city, and a special train of invited guests from\r\nthe East arrived at Winthrop before noon with flags flying and bands\r\nplaying. The passenger steamer, “Black Hawk,” loaded to the guards with\r\ncitizens from Kansas City, reached Atchison early in the morning, and\r\nleading citizens also came from Wyandotte, Leavenworth, Lawrence, Topeka\r\nand other towns. The city had been cleaned up and put in holiday attire\r\nby the city authorities. The town had never before presented such a gay\r\nappearance. Frank A. Root in his interesting book, “The Overland Stage\r\nto California,” who was present at the celebration, has perhaps written\r\nthe most interesting account of this event that has ever been printed.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n“In the procession that formed along Second street, one of the unique\r\nand attractive features was a mammoth government wagon trimmed with\r\nevergreens and loaded with thirty-four girls dressed in white,\r\nrepresenting every State in the Union and the Territory of Kansas. There\r\nwere three other wagons filled with little girls similarly dressed,\r\nrepresenting all the forty-one counties of Kansas in its last year of\r\nterritorial existence.\r\n\r\n“One of the contractors for government freighting had a huge prairie\r\nschooner, drawn by twenty-nine yoke of oxen, the head of each animal\r\nornamented with a small flag, while he himself was mounted upon a mule.\r\nThe contractor was quite an attraction, dressed in the peculiar western\r\nprairie and plains frontier cow-boy costume with buckskin pants, red\r\nflannel shirt, boots nearly knee high, with revolver and bowie knife\r\nbuckled around his waist, dangling by his side. The procession in line,\r\nmarched west along Commercial street to near Tenth. It was a long one\r\nand it was estimated that there were 7,000 people in it and at least\r\n10,000 in the city witnessing the festivities. The ceremony of breaking\r\nground for these two roads took place about noon, but there was nothing\r\nparticularly imposing about it. The most important part of the\r\nceremonies was the turning over of a few spadefuls of dirt by Col. Peter\r\nT. Abell, president of the road, and Capt. Eph. Butcher, the contractor,\r\nwho built the Atchison & St. Joseph road. The event was witnessed by\r\nfully 5,000 people, after which the monster procession formed, and,\r\nheaded by a brass band, and other bands at different places in the line,\r\nmarched across White Clay creek to the grove in the southwest part of\r\nthe city, where the oration was delivered by Benj. F. Stringfellow.\r\nFollowing the oration several speeches were made by the most prominent\r\nof the invited guests, one of them by Col. C. K. Holliday, of Topeka,\r\none of the founders of the great Santa Fe system. The barbeque was an\r\nimportant feature of the affair. Six beeves, twenty hogs, and over fifty\r\nsheep, pigs and lambs were roasted. There was also prepared more than\r\none hundred boiled hams, several thousand loaves of bread, cakes by the\r\nhundred, besides sundry other delicacies to tickle the palate and help\r\nmake the occasion one long to be remembered by all present. The\r\nexercises were quite elaborate and wound up with a ball in the evening\r\nat A. S. Parker’s hall on the west side of Sixth street, between\r\nCommercial and Main and a wine supper in Charley Holbert’s building on\r\nSecond street, just north of the Massasoit House. Many visitors came\r\nfrom a long distance east, some as far as New England. Most of the\r\nNorthern States were represented, and a few came from the South. Free\r\ntransportation was furnished the invited guests. Hundreds came by rail\r\nand steamboat and many poured in from the surrounding country for miles,\r\nin wagons and on horseback, from eastern Kansas and western Missouri.”\r\n\r\nWhile a strong movement for the construction of railroads was started in\r\n1860, it was soon discovered that much progress could not be made in the\r\nface of the unsettled conditions brought on by the Civil war, and, as a\r\nresult a further effort in that direction, was, for the time being,\r\nabandoned. However, Luther C. Challiss did not give up his idea of\r\nprojecting a road to the West, and to him more than to anybody else\r\nbelongs the credit of starting the first road west out of Atchison. He\r\nobtained a charter for the building of the Atchison & Pike’s Peak\r\nrailroad and this company was organized February 11, 1859, but on\r\naccount of the war was not opened to Waterville until January 20, 1868.\r\nChalliss obtained possession of 150,000 acres of land from the Kickapoo\r\nIndians by a treaty, and, upon the organization of the company he was\r\nelected president. The land he secured from the Indians was, for the\r\nmost part, located in Atchison county, around Muscotah, and adjoining\r\ncounties. With Mr. Challiss were associated Charles B. Keith, who was\r\nthe agent of the Kickapoo Indians, George W. Glick and Senators Pomeroy\r\nand Lane. In the charter for this road provision was made for its\r\nconstruction 100 miles west of Atchison. Col. William Osborn, who had\r\nconstructed the west half of the Hannibal & St. Joseph railroad, built\r\nthe first section of the Central Branch to Waterville. He named the town\r\nafter his old home in New York, where he was born. It was proposed at\r\nthis point to make a connection with a branch running from Kansas City\r\nto Ft. Kearney, Neb., but the Kansas City road was subsequently changed\r\nto Denver, and for this reason it has been said the Central Branch was\r\nnot completed to Denver, as originally planned.\r\n\r\nThe Atchison & Pike’s Peak Railroad Company was incorporated by special\r\nact of the Territorial legislature of the Territory of Kansas, chapter\r\n48, “Private Laws of Kansas, 1859,” and authorized to construct a\r\nrailroad from Atchison to the western boundary of the Territory in the\r\ndirection of Pike’s Peak. Subsequently, the Atchison & Pike’s Peak\r\nRailroad Company became the assignee of all the rights, privileges and\r\nfranchises of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad Company, given and\r\ngranted under an Act of Congress, of July 8, 1862, Twelfth Statute, page\r\n489, entitled: “An Act to aid in the construction of a railroad and\r\ntelegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean, and to\r\nsecure to the government the use of same for postal, military and other\r\npurposes,” which provided that the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad\r\nCompany might extend its road from St. Joseph via Atchison, to connect\r\nand unite with a railroad in Kansas, provided for in said Act, for one\r\nhundred miles in length next to the Missouri river, and might, for that\r\npurpose, use any railroad charter, which had, or might have been\r\ngranted, by the legislature of Kansas. Accordingly, the work of\r\nconstruction from Atchison west was inaugurated under the name of the\r\nAtchison & Pike’s Peak Railroad Company. On January 1, 1867, by virtue\r\nof the laws of the State of Kansas, the name of Atchison & Pike’s Peak\r\nRailroad Company was changed to the Central Branch Union Pacific\r\nRailroad Company, and the latter company completed the railroad from\r\nAtchison to Waterville.\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE ATCHISON, TOPEKA & SANTA FE RAILWAY COMPANY.\r\n\r\nThe first real move for the construction of a railroad from the Missouri\r\nriver, west, resulted in a charter granted by the Territorial\r\nlegislature to the St. Joseph & Topeka Railroad Company February 20,\r\n1857. Under the terms of the charter the road was to start from St.\r\nJoseph, Mo.; thence crossing the river through Doniphan, Atchison and\r\nJefferson counties to Topeka. The charter was subsequently amended and\r\nthe road was extended in the direction of Santa Fe, N. M., to the\r\nsouthwestern line of Kansas, which is practically the same route now\r\ntraversed by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad. The desire on the\r\npart of the people for direct railroad connection with the Missouri\r\nriver and the East gave to this movement great impetus, and there was\r\nconsiderable rivalry between the towns to offer aid and assistance. The\r\npeople of Atchison were particularly anxious to make this town the\r\nterminal point and the future railway center of the great trans-\r\ncontinental system, and strongly opposed any project which would make\r\nAtchison simply a way station on the great road to the West. With a view\r\nto avert such action on the part of those behind the movement to\r\nconstruct this road, it was determined to make Atchison the eastern\r\nterminus of the same. Accordingly, Atchison loaned its credit to the\r\namount of $150,000. by aid of which subsidy a direct road was built on\r\nthe Missouri side of the river from St. Joseph and thence north under\r\nanother charter with Atchison, Kan., instead of St. Joseph as the\r\neastern terminus, the enterprise was carried on and as a result the\r\ncitizens of Kansas Territory were much elated with the added prestige of\r\nthe railroad being a Kansas corporation. The Atchison & Topeka Railroad\r\nCompany was incorporated by an Act of the legislature February 11, 1859.\r\nThose named as the original incorporators were: S. C. Pomeroy, Atchison;\r\nC. K. Halliday, Topeka; Luther C. Challiss, Atchison; Peter T. Abell,\r\nAtchison; Aspah Allen, Topeka: Milton C. Dickey, Topeka; Samuel Dickson,\r\nAtchison; Wilson L. Gordon, Topeka; George S. Hillyer, Grasshopper\r\nFalls; Lorenzo D. Bird, Atchison; Jeremiah Marshall, Topeka; George H.\r\nFairchild, Atchison; F. L. Crane, Topeka. The company was “authorized to\r\nsurvey, locate, construct, complete, alter, maintain and operate a\r\nrailroad with one or more tracks from or near Atchison in Kansas\r\nTerritory, to the town of Topeka, in Kansas Territory, and to such point\r\non the southern or western boundary of said Territory in the direction\r\nof Santa Fe as may be convenient and suitable for the construction of\r\nsaid road and also to construct a branch to any point on the southern\r\nline of said Territory in the direction of the Gulf of Mexico.” The\r\nauthorized capital stock was $1,500,000, and the first meeting for\r\norganization under the charter was held at the office of Luther C.\r\nChallis in Atchison September 15, 1859, at which meeting $52,000 of the\r\nfirst subscription of stock was paid, and the following directors were\r\nchosen: L. C. Challiss, George H. Fairchild, P. T. Abell, S. C. Pomeroy,\r\nL. D. Bird, C. K. Halliday, F. L. Crane, E. G. Ross, Joel H. Huntoon, M.\r\nC. Dickey, Jacob Safford, R. H. Weightman, and J. H. Stringfellow. The\r\nofficers were: C. K. Holliday, president; P. T. Abell, secretary; M. C.\r\nDickey, treasurer. It will be seen that the majority of the\r\nincorporators and of the officers were citizens of Atchison, and it is\r\nan important fact in the history of Kansas that Atchison county played\r\nsuch an important part in the organization and construction of the first\r\nrailroad lines in the State. Had it not been for the terrible drought of\r\n1860, which totally paralyzed all classes of business, the work of\r\nconstructing this road immediately following its organization would have\r\ngone forward, but the famine which followed the drought was so complete\r\nand so widely distributed throughout the State and the western country\r\nas to almost destroy the farming interests. During this period the\r\ndirectors of the road decided to press the claims of Kansas for a\r\nnational subsidy for the construction of railroads, and President C. K.\r\nHolliday, with a number of his associates, spent much time in Washington\r\nduring 1859 and 1860. Their work was not in vain, for on March 3, 1863,\r\nCongress made a grant of land to the State of Kansas, giving alternate\r\nsections one mile square and ten in width, amounting to 6,400 acres per\r\nmile, on condition that the Atchison-Topeka road should be finished on\r\nor before 1873. The State accepted the grant and transferred it to this\r\nroad February 9, 1864. It was in October, 1868, almost ten years after\r\nthe date that the first charter was granted to this road that work of\r\nconstruction was begun in Topeka. The road was first built in a\r\nsoutherly direction so as to reach the coal region in Osage county. It\r\nwas opened to Carbondale, eighteen miles from Topeka, in July, 1869, and\r\nreached Wichita, 163 miles from Topeka, in May, 1872, and at about the\r\nsame time in 1872 the road was completed from Topeka to Atchison, a\r\ndistance of fifty-one miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   ATCHISON & NEBRASKA CITY RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nOn May 5, 1867, the charter for the Atchison & Nebraska City Railroad\r\nCompany was filed in the office of the secretary of State of the State\r\nof Kansas. The original incorporators of this road were Peter T. Abell,\r\nGeorge W. Glick, Alfred G. Otis, John M. Price, W. W. Cochrane, Albert\r\nH. Horton, Samuel A. Kingman, J. T. Hereford and Augustus Byram, all of\r\nwhom were citizens of Atchison. The charter provided for the\r\nconstruction of a railroad from “some point in the city of Atchison to\r\nsome point on the north line of the State of Kansas, not farther west\r\nthan twenty-five miles from the Missouri river, and the length of the\r\nproposed railroad will not exceed forty-five miles.” Shortly after the\r\nroad was incorporated the name was changed to the Atchison & Nebraska\r\nRailroad Company, and under this name subscriptions in bonds and capital\r\nstock were made in Atchison and Doniphan counties. Atchison county\r\nsubscribed for $150,000, and in addition to the subscription of the\r\ncounty there were individual subscriptions amounting to $80,000 in the\r\ncounty. Work was commenced on the road in 1869, and it was completed in\r\n1871 to the northern boundary of Doniphan county, three miles north of\r\nWhitecloud. The stockholders of Atchison graded the road bed to the\r\nState line, constructed bridges and furnished the ties, after which the\r\nentire property was given to a Boston syndicate in consideration of the\r\ncompletion and operation of the road. This railroad was afterwards\r\nconsolidated with the Atchison, Lincoln & Columbus Railroad Company of\r\nNebraska, which road had been authorized to construct a railroad from\r\nthe northern terminal point of the Atchison & Nebraska railroad to\r\nColumbus, on the Union Pacific railroad, by way of Lincoln, and the road\r\nwas completed to Lincoln in the fall of 1872. This consolidated road was\r\npurchased by the Burlington & Missouri River Railroad Company in 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n          KANSAS CITY, LEAVENWORTH & ATCHISON RAILWAY COMPANY.\r\n\r\nThis road was organized by articles of association filed in the office\r\nof the Secretary of the State of Kansas September 21, 1867, and March\r\n25, 1868, and the Missouri River Railroad Company by articles of\r\nassociation filed February 20, 1865, and the construction of the\r\nLeavenworth, Atchison & Northwestern railroad was commenced at\r\nLeavenworth in March, 1869, and completed to Atchison in September,\r\n1869. The stock held in the company by Leavenworth county, aggregating\r\n$500,000, was donated to this road to aid in its extension to Atchison,\r\nand the first train into Atchison arrived in the latter part of 1869. It\r\nwas not until July, 1882, however, that the first train was run through\r\nfrom Atchison to Omaha over the line of the Missouri Pacific railroad,\r\nwhich subsequently absorbed the Leavenworth, Atchison & Northwestern\r\nRailroad Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE CHICAGO, ROCK ISLAND & PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company was one of the last\r\nof the railroads to make connection with Atchison. This line was\r\noriginally projected to Leavenworth, but reached Atchison shortly after.\r\nThe construction of the Atchison branch was begun in 1872, and in July\r\nof that year the first train was run into the city.\r\n\r\nAll of these roads having been organized and constructed and in\r\noperation, the next movement that took place in transportation circles\r\nwas the erection of the bridge across the Missouri river, work upon\r\nwhich was commenced in August, 1874, and completed in July, 1875. This\r\nbridge is 1,182 feet long and the stone for the piers and abutments upon\r\nwhich it rests was taken from the quarries at Cottonwood Falls, Chase\r\ncounty. It was originally built by the American Bridge Company of\r\nChicago, and was rebuilt entirely new, except for the piers, in 1898.\r\nShortly after the erection of the bridge, connecting Missouri with\r\nKansas at Atchison, the first railroad depot was built upon the site of\r\nthe present union station, which was completed and dedicated September\r\n7, 1880. There was a great deal of discussion as to the proper location\r\nof a depot before the building was finally erected, and it was through\r\nthe efforts of the Burneses that its location on Main street, between\r\nSecond and Fourth street, was selected. The capital stock of the\r\noriginal Depot Company was $100,000,000, of which the railroad companies\r\nthen entering the city subscribed for $70,000. The balance of the stock\r\nwas taken by individuals. The cost of the original depot was $120,000,\r\nand the architect was William E. Taylor, who planned the old union\r\nstation in Kansas City. James A. McGonigle, who was the contractor for\r\nthe old Kansas City station, also built the Atchison union depot. It was\r\nbuilt of the finest pressed brick from St. Louis, and trimmed with cut\r\nstone from the Cottonwood Falls quarries. Its length was 235 feet, with\r\nan “L” ninety-six feet long. It was two stories high with a mansard\r\nroof. It was an ornamental, and, in those days, an imposing structure.\r\nThe ceremonies accompanying its dedication were witnessed by a great\r\ncrowd, and many great men in the railroad and political life of Kansas\r\nparticipated in them. Gen. Benjamin F. Stringfellow delivered the\r\naddress, and a banquet was served in the evening, followed by a\r\nprocession and fire-works. Two years later, in June, 1882, this depot\r\nwas partially destroyed by fire, suffering a loss of $10,000, but it was\r\nimmediately rebuilt. On January 6, 1888, another fire completely\r\ndestroyed the building, and the present union station was erected a\r\nshort time later.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HANNIBAL & ST. JOSEPH RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nOn and after Monday, February 28, this road will be open for business\r\nthroughout its entire length. Passenger trains will leave St. Joseph for\r\nHannibal every morning, making close connection with steam packets to\r\nSt. Louis and Quincy, and affording direct connection with all the\r\nrailroads east of the Mississippi river. Time from St. Joseph to\r\nHannibal, eleven hours, and to St. Louis, eighteen hours, saving more\r\nthan three days over any other route. Trains from the east will arrive\r\nin St. Joseph every evening, connecting with a daily line of packets\r\nrunning between St. Joseph and Kansas City; also a line up the Missouri\r\nto the Bluffs. Passengers from all parts of Kansas will find this the\r\nquickest and most agreeable route to St. Louis and all points on the\r\nMississippi, giving those going east a choice between the routes from\r\nSt. Louis, Alton and Quincy. Fare will be as low as by any other route.\r\nFavorable arrangements will be made for taking freight, saving most of\r\nthe heavy insurance on the Missouri river. Express freight will be taken\r\nthrough much quicker than by any other line.\r\n\r\nTickets can be had at the office in St. Joseph for nearly all parts of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n                                                     JOSIAH HUNT, Sup’t.\r\n\r\n     P.

JOSEPH RAILROAD.\r\n\r\n                 NEW ROUTE OPEN FOR THE EAST AND SOUTH.\r\n\r\nPassengers for St. Louis, northern Missouri, Iowa, Chicago, Cincinnati,\r\nDetroit, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans,\r\nLouisville and Southern States, will find this the shortest, quickest\r\nand most desirable route to the above points. On the 1st day of February\r\nonly fifteen miles of staging intervenes between St. Joseph and\r\nHannibal, and on the 1st day of March, 1859, the road will be completed,\r\nand open for through travel the entire length. A daily line of stages\r\nfrom Atchison, passing through Doniphan and Geary City, connects at St.\r\nJoseph with the H. & St. Jo. railroad. From Hannibal a daily line of\r\npackets leave upon arrival of cars for St. Louis, upon the opening of\r\nnavigation, and boats connect at Quincy with the C. B. & Q. railroad for\r\nChicago, and with the G. W. railroad for Toledo via Naples. This is in\r\nevery respect the best route for eastern and southern passengers. Trains\r\nleave St. Joseph for the east daily.\r\n\r\n                                                     JOSIAH HUNT, Sup’t.\r\n\r\n P. B. GROAT, General Ticket Agent.\r\n\r\n                                (no. 47)\r\n       (From _Freedom’s Champion_, Atchison, February 12, 1859.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE FIRST TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nIt was a little over six months after the completion of the Atchison &\r\nSt. Joseph railroad that the first telegraph connection was established\r\nbetween Atchison and the world. The construction of the Missouri &\r\nWestern telegraph line was begun in Syracuse, Mo., in 1859. Charles M.\r\nStebbins built this telegraph line, which extended from Syracuse to Ft.\r\nSmith, Ark. A branch of this line was extended westward to Kansas City,\r\nand reached Leavenworth along in the spring of 1859. August 15, 1859,\r\nthis branch was extended to Atchison, and it was a proud day in the\r\nhistory of this city. The first office was in a brick building on\r\nCommercial street adjoining the office of _Freedom’s Champion_. John T.\r\nTracy was the first operator. Gen. Samuel C. Pomeroy was mayor, and on\r\nthis account the honor was given him of sending the first message, which\r\nwas as follows: “Atchison, August 15, 1859. His Honor, H. B. Denman,\r\nMayor of Leavenworth. Our medium of communication is perfect. May our\r\nfraternal relations continue—may our prosperity and success equal our\r\nhighest efforts. S. C. Pomeroy, Mayor of Atchison.” Mayor Denman replied\r\nas follows: “Hon. S. C. Pomeroy, Mayor of Atchison. May each push\r\nforward its works of enterprise and the efforts of each be crowned with\r\nsuccess. H. B. Denman, Mayor of Leavenworth.” Congratulations were next\r\nexchanged between Atchison and St. Louis, as follows: “Atchison, August\r\n15, 1859. Hon. O. D. Filley, Mayor of St. Louis. For the first time\r\nsince the world began, a telegraph message is sent to St. Louis from\r\nthis place, the farthest telegraph station in the West. Accept our\r\ncongratulations and aid us in our progress westward. S. C. Pomeroy,\r\nMayor of Atchison.” It was in October of that same year that the first\r\nnews was flashed over the wire telling of the capture of Harper’s Ferry\r\nby old John Brown.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the question of early day transportation in Atchison\r\ncounty, it would be an oversight to fail to mention the efforts of one\r\nThomas L. Fortune to improve the means of locomotion. Mr. Fortune was a\r\ncitizen of Mt. Pleasant, and in the fall of 1859 he conceived the scheme\r\nwhich he believed would revolutionize the whole transportation problem.\r\nHe planned a steam wagon with which he expected to haul freight across\r\nthe plains. The following year he built at St. Louis, a large vehicle,\r\ntwenty feet long by eight feet wide. The wheels were twenty inches wide\r\nand eight feet in diameter. This wagon was transported up the Missouri\r\nriver to Atchison from St. Louis on the steamer, “Meteor,” and was\r\nlanded from the steamer in front of the White Mice saloon, which was a\r\nnoted resort on the Atchison levee at that time, in the latter part of\r\nJune, 1860. The following account is taken from Frank A. Root’s\r\n“Overland Stage to California”:\r\n\r\nA day or two after its arrival (referring to Fortune’s wagon) Mr. Root\r\nsays that it was arranged that the steam wagon should make a trial trip\r\non the Fourth of July. The monster was accordingly fired up on the\r\neighty-fourth National anniversary and started by an engineer named\r\nCallahan. The wagon was ornamented with a number of flags and loaded\r\nwith a crowd of anxious men and boys. When everything was in readiness\r\nthe valve was opened and the wagon moved off in a southerly direction\r\nfrom the levee. It went all right until it reached the foot of\r\nCommercial street, about a square away. The pilot failing to turn the\r\nmachine, it kept on straight up to the sidewalk and ran into A. S.\r\nParker’s warehouse, which stood so many years by the old historic\r\ncottonwood tree at the southeast corner of Commercial street and the\r\nlevee. The result of this awkward blunder was an accident, in which a\r\nson of the owner of the wagon had an arm broken, as the machine crashed\r\ninto the side of the building, which was a long, one-story frame\r\ncottonwood structure that for a number of years was a noted landmark in\r\nAtchison. The excited engineer was at once let out and Lewis Higby,\r\nanother engineer, and a natural genius, was sent for. Higby mounted the\r\nwagon and took his place at the engine, backed the machine out into the\r\nmiddle of the road and in a few minutes went sailing gracefully along\r\nwest on Commercial street at about six miles per hour. When in front of\r\nJesse Crall’s stable at the corner of Sixth street, before that part of\r\nCommercial street had been graded, it went down a little hill at a\r\nlively speed, but Higby kept it going and did not stop until it reached\r\nL. C. Challiss’ addition, just south and west from Commercial and Eighth\r\nstreets, near Morgan Willard’s old foundry, built in 1859, away from the\r\nbusiness and residence portion of the city.\r\n\r\nAfter the wagon crossed Eighth street and was beyond the business\r\nhouses, Higby turned on more steam, and the monster vehicle made about\r\neight miles an hour, cavorting around on the bottom, there being only a\r\nfew scattering buildings then west of Eighth street. To test the\r\npracticability of the machine, it was run into hollows and gullies, and,\r\nwhere the ground was soft it was found that the ponderous wheels would\r\nsink into the mud when standing still in soft ground. The result of the\r\ntrial, witnessed by hundreds, was disappointing to most of those\r\npresent. The inventor, who had spent a large amount of money and much\r\ntime in trying to perfect his steam wagon and solve the overland\r\ntransportation problem, was the worst disappointed. He was thoroughly\r\ndisgusted. He saw at once that the use of the vehicle was impracticable\r\nand that it would never answer the purpose. That trial trip was the\r\nfirst and only one the “overland steam wagon” ever made. It was\r\naccordingly abandoned on the bottom where the tracks of the Central\r\nBranch and Santa Fe roads are now laid, and was never afterwards fired\r\nup. Those who had crossed the plains with mules and oxen, knew it could\r\nnever be used in overland freighting. There was no use for any such\r\nvehicle and the anticipated reduction in prices of ox and mule teams did\r\nnot take place. The timbers used in the framework of the machine that\r\nwere not stolen finally went to decay, and the machinery was afterwards\r\ntaken out and disposed of for other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MODERN TRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe propitious beginning that Atchison had as a commercial and\r\ntransportation center should have made the town one of the largest and\r\nmost important railroad terminals in the West. That was the hope and\r\naspiration of its original founders, and for many years afterwards it\r\nwas a cherished idea. But Kansas City was subsequently selected as the\r\npoint of vantage, and the builders of this great western empire have\r\nsince centralized their activities at the mouth of the “Kaw,” and it is\r\nthere that the metropolis of the West will be built. However, a\r\nmarvelous development has taken place here since the day of the Holladay\r\nand Butterfield stage lines and slow-moving ox and mule trains across\r\nthe plains. We no longer marvel at the volume of trade and freight\r\ntonnage and the multitude of travelers that pass through Atchison every\r\nyear. We take these things as a matter of course, and make no note of\r\nthe daily arrival and departure of the fifty-six passenger trains at our\r\nunion depot every day; we marvel not at the speed and the ease and\r\ncomfort with which we can make the trip to St. Louis or Chicago, over\r\nnight, or to Denver in less than twenty-four hours, or to New York in\r\ntwo and one-half days, and to San Francisco in less than five,\r\nsurrounded by every luxury money can buy. We have accustomed ourselves\r\nto these marvels, just as we have learned to make use of the telephone\r\nand the telegraph, and a little later on will begin to use the air ship\r\nand the wireless. Nature has a way of easily adjusting mankind to these\r\nchanged conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n                    REMINISCENCES OF EARLY PIONEERS.\r\n\r\n  D.

Howe’s Historical\r\nEdition of the _Atchison Daily Globe_. It contains much interesting and\r\nvaluable information written in the unique style which has made Mr. Howe\r\nfamous. With the consent of Mr. Howe, which he has very kindly granted\r\nthe author of this history, there will appear in this chapter, almost\r\nverbatim, a number of biographical sketches and other interesting\r\nmatter, which should be printed in book form so that it could be assured\r\nof a permanent place in the archives of the State. There are but few\r\ncopies left, and these are in a bad state of disintegration. The sketch\r\nof Gen. D. R. Atchison will first be reproduced herein, and then will\r\nfollow others, touching upon the lives and characters of early settlers,\r\nwho contributed their part to the upbuilding of this community. Much has\r\nalready appeared in this history touching upon the activities of General\r\nAtchison, but a sketch of his life is important, inasmuch as he is\r\nperhaps the most conspicuous early-day character in the history of\r\nAtchison county.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GENERAL D. R. ATCHISON.\r\n\r\nDavid Rice Atchison, for whom Atchison was named, was born near\r\nLexington, Fayette county, Kentucky, August 11, 1807. The son of William\r\nAtchison, a wealthy farmer of that county, he received all the\r\nadvantages of a liberal education. His mother’s maiden name was\r\nCatherine Allen, a native of the State of Georgia. William Atchison, the\r\nfather, was a Pennsylvanian by birth.\r\n\r\nDavid R. Atchison was blessed with six children, four sons and two\r\ndaughters. In 1825 he graduated with high honor from Transylvania\r\nUniversity, then the leading institution of learning in the State, and\r\nsince incorporated in the new University of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving his degrees in the arts, Mr. Atchison immediately applied\r\nhimself to the study of law. In 1829 Mr. Atchison was admitted to\r\npractice in his native State, and a few months after, in 1830, removed\r\nto the comparatively wild district of Clay county, Missouri. In April of\r\nthat year he received in St. Louis his license to practice in the\r\nsupreme court of the State and immediately settled in the village of\r\nLiberty, now the county seat of Clay county. About this period, Mr.\r\nAtchison was appointed major general of the northern division of the\r\nMissouri State militia.\r\n\r\nGeneral Atchison soon commanded a lucrative practice in his new home,\r\nwhere he continued to reside in the discharge of the duties of his\r\nprofession until February, 1841, when his superior legal attainments,\r\nwhich were known and recognized throughout the State, won for him the\r\nappointment as judge of the district court of Platte county on its\r\norganization in February of that year, when he moved his residence to\r\nPlatte City. It appears that in that day judges were appointed to this\r\nposition by the Government, with the advice and consent of the Senate.\r\nThe office was not made elective until several years after. In 1834 and\r\n1838 he was elected to the Missouri legislature from Clay county.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Dr. Lyon, United States senator, in 1838, Judge\r\nAtchison was appointed by Governor Reynolds to the vacancy in the\r\nSenate. It was by many considered that this appointment was merited and\r\nhe had been recommended by Colonel Benton and other authorities of the\r\nDemocratic party; by others it was said that the governor himself was\r\nambitious of the senatorship and had selected Judge Atchison as a person\r\nwho could be easily beaten at the next election. The death of Governor\r\nReynolds, however, occurred before the meeting of the next legislature\r\nand Judge Atchison was elected with but slight opposition. He was\r\nreëlected for two more terms, the last of which expired March 4, 1855,\r\nduring the administration of Franklin Pierce. Two years after this he\r\nmoved his residence from Platte to Clinton county. He was elected\r\npresident of the Senate to succeed Judge Mangun, a Whig senator from\r\nNorth Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe 4th of March, 1849, occurring on Sunday, Zachary Taylor was not\r\ninaugurated until the following Monday. Judge Atchison thus, as\r\npresiding officer of the Senate, became virtually President of the\r\nUnited States during the term of twenty-four hours. In referring to this\r\naccidental dignity, on being interrogated as to how he enjoyed his\r\nexalted position, the venerable senator good humoredly replied that he\r\ncould tell but little about it as, overcome with fatigue consequent to\r\nseveral days and nights of official labor, he slept through nearly his\r\nwhole term of service.\r\n\r\nJudge Atchison became especially prominent in the legislature for the\r\norganization of the territories of Kansas and Nebraska, and claims to\r\nhave originated the repeal of the Missouri Compromise bill. On his\r\nretirement from the Senate, of which he was an honored member for the\r\nspace of twelve years, during the larger part of the time as presiding\r\nofficer, he continued to take a lively interest in the politics of the\r\ncountry, and was regarded as a leader and chief adviser of the pro-\r\nslavery party in Kansas during the troubles which preceded the admission\r\nas a State. In 1856 we find him in command of 1,150 men at a point\r\ncalled Santa Fe. On the 29th of August, the same year, a detachment from\r\nGeneral Atchison’s army attacked Osawatomie, which was defended by about\r\nfifty men, who made a vigorous resistance but were defeated with a loss\r\nof five wounded and seven prisoners. Five of the assailants were killed\r\nand thirty buildings were burned. The next day a body of Free State men\r\nmarched from Lawrence to take Atchison’s army. Upon their approach the\r\nlatter retired and withdrew its forces into Missouri. The admission of\r\nKansas as a free State soon after this occurred put an end to this much\r\nvexed question and restored tranquility to the country.\r\n\r\nGeneral Atchison lived in retirement on his magnificent estate in\r\nClinton county until the breaking out of the Rebellion, when he left for\r\nthe South and was present at the battle of Lexington. Governor Jackson\r\nsecured him a commission as brigadier general at the commencement of the\r\nwar. This General Atchison declined, as his residence was in Clinton\r\ncounty, outside the limits of the division. He, however, remained with\r\nthe army and assisted in its organization. He joined temporarily for the\r\npurpose of making up the company under Ephraim Kelley’s command from St.\r\nJoseph and remained with the army until after the battle of Elkhorn.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war, General Atchison returned to his home in\r\nClinton county, where he continued to reside in almost unbroken\r\nretirement on his 1,700–acre farm in a neat cottage erected on the site\r\nof his spacious brick mansion, which was accidentally destroyed by fire\r\nFebruary 2, 1870. He never married, and died at his home in Clinton\r\ncounty, January 26, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MATT. GERBER.\r\n\r\nMatt. Gerber came to this county originally in 1855, as pastry cook on a\r\nGovernment steamer. There was almost no town at Atchison then, and he\r\nwent to Sioux City with the boat and afterwards returned to St. Louis.\r\nIn 1856 he was pastry cook on the “A. B. Chambers,” which ran between\r\nSt. Louis and Weston and was commanded by Captain Bowman, the father of\r\nMrs. D. C. Newcomb and Mrs. G. H. T. Johnson. Mr. Gerber was born in\r\nBaden in 1833 and came to America in 1853, landing at New Orleans, and\r\nfor a time ran on boats on the lower Mississippi. For many years he was\r\nthe hero of Atchison children, as he operated a bakery, confectionery\r\nand toy store on the south side of Commercial street, near Fourth. Mr.\r\nGerber first located in Sumner in 1858, where he ran a bakery, coming to\r\nAtchison in 1860, and was in business at the same location for over\r\nthirty-four years. Mr. Gerber died in Atchison, December 14, 1907.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  S. O. POMEROY\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JIM LANE\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             J. H. TALBOTT.\r\n\r\nJ. H. Talbott came west in 1855 and was a passenger on the “A. B.\r\nChambers,” of which George W. Bowman was captain and E. K. Blair, second\r\nclerk. The cholera was so bad that year that Mr. Talbott left the boat\r\nat Jefferson City and came overland to Monrovia, although his passage\r\nwas paid to Leavenworth. Several passengers on the “A. B. Chambers” died\r\nof cholera and were buried on sand bars. Mr. Talbott preëmpted a claim\r\nat Monrovia, and when his family came two years later he kept a boarding\r\nhouse at Monrovia for four years. Albert D. Richardson was often a guest\r\nat his house. He was a clean, neat city man of about thirty, and was\r\nengaged in writing up the Kansas war for the _New York Tribune_. Jim\r\nLane also stopped at J. H. Talbott’s occasionally. Mr. Talbott first\r\nheard him make a speech in a grove at Pardee, and A. J. Westbrook was in\r\nthe audience. Lane made some abusive reference to Westbrook, who made a\r\nmovement as if to pull a pistol, but Lane shook his celebrated boney\r\nfinger at Westbrook and defied him to shoot. At that time Atchison was\r\ncontrolled by the pro-slavery element, but the Free State men\r\npredominated around Monrovia and Pardee. The noted Colonel Caleb lived\r\nat Farmington. James Ridpath was often at J. H. Talbott’s, and D. R.\r\nAnthony and Webb Wilder appeared there as young men and took up claims.\r\n\r\nAnother famous place in those days was the Seven Mile House, seven miles\r\nwest of Atchison on the road traveled by the freighters, kept by John\r\nBradford. Talbott’s boarding house was built of logs and the beds were\r\nnailed against the wall, one above another. Sometimes the house was so\r\ncrowded that the floor was also occupied with beds.\r\n\r\nMr. Talbott was born in Canal Dover, Ohio, where he knew W. C. Quantrill\r\nreal well. Quantrill afterwards became the noted guerilla and sacked\r\nLawrence. Mrs. Talbott went to school with Quantrill, and the teacher\r\nwas Quantrill’s father, a very worthy man. After Mr. Talbott married he\r\nremoved to Zanesville, Ind., and kept a store with S. J. H. Snyder, who\r\nwas one of the early settlers of Atchison county and a fierce Free State\r\nman. In a little while Will Quantrill appeared at Zanesville and taught\r\nschool in the country. He usually spent his Saturdays and Sundays at J.\r\nH. Talbott’s house, on the strength of their acquaintance at Canal\r\nDover. Mr. Talbott says he was well behaved and attracted great\r\nattention around the store, particularly from the young men.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Quantrill left Zanesville and settled at Lawrence, Kan., as a\r\nFree State man and taught school, where he became acquainted with Robert\r\nBitter Morrow, whose life he afterwards saved during the massacre.\r\nRobert Morrow kept the Byram in Atchison several years. When Talbott\r\nwent to Monrovia in 1855, the country was full of Kickapoo Indians. He\r\nremembers seeing an Indian grave there: a rail pen covered with brush.\r\nIn the middle of the pen could be seen the dead Indian in a sitting\r\nposture, with his gun beside him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         COL. WILLIAM OSBORNE.\r\n\r\nColonel Osborne built the first railroad to the Missouri river—the\r\nHannibal & St. Joseph. He built and owned the transfer ferry “Wm.\r\nOsborne,” which was famous in Atchison in the early days. He also built\r\nthe first 100 miles of the Central Branch to Waterville, as has been\r\npreviously stated. He lived and died in Waterville, N. Y., but visited\r\nAtchison frequently to see his daughter, Mrs. R. A. Park, who was the\r\nwife of the president of the Atchison Savings Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            AMOS A. HOWELL.\r\n\r\nAmos A. Howell was one of the plains freighters who distinguished\r\nAtchison in the early days. He ran twenty-seven wagons with six yoke of\r\noxen to each wagon. An extra head of oxen was taken along, known as the\r\n“cavvy” to spell the others and take the places of those that gave out.\r\nAltogether he owned 400 head of work oxen. The oxen were expected to\r\npick up their living on the way, but when mules were used in the winter\r\nit was necessary to carry grain for them. Thirty men were necessary in\r\nthe train of twenty-seven wagons pulled by oxen. Mr. Howell was assisted\r\nin his wagon business by his son, Nat.\r\n\r\nIn those days there was a Government regulation that all trains should\r\nbe held at Ft. Kearney until 100 armed men had collected. Then a captain\r\nwas elected, who was commissioned by the Government and had absolute\r\ncharge of the train while it was passing through the Indian country. Mr.\r\nHowell frequently occupied the position of captain, being well known on\r\nthe plains. On one occasion while he was captain he halted at Cottonwood\r\nFalls on the Platte, as the Indians were very bad, and soldiers were\r\nexpected to go through with the train, but none came and finally Mr.\r\nHowell unloaded five wagons, filled them with armed men and started out.\r\nAlmost in sight of Cottonwood a gang of gaily painted Indians attacked\r\nthe train, supposing it was a little outfit. But when the Indians came\r\nwithin range, the “Whiskey Bills” and “Poker Petes” in the covered\r\nwagons began dropping the Indians off their ponies, and there was a\r\npretty fight, in which the Indians were badly worsted.\r\n\r\nMr. Howell says that the Indians never attack wagon trains except very\r\nearly in the morning, or late in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe favorite sport of the Indians, however, was to run off the stock\r\nafter the train had gone into camp at night, and they always had one way\r\nof doing it, which Mr. Howell finally learned. The Indians are no wiser\r\nthan white men, for they say that white men always fail in business the\r\nsame way and act the same way when they have a fire. An Indian would\r\nride up onto a high point and look around a while. This would always be\r\nin the evening when the train was near a camping place. Then the Indian\r\nwould disappear and come back presently with another Indian wrapped in\r\nhis blanket and riding the same pony. One Indian would then drop into\r\nthe grass, and the rider would go back after another one. The Indians\r\nwere collecting in ambush; thinking the freighters would never think of\r\nit. Mr. Howell had in his employ a driver, an Atchison man, named\r\n“Whiskey Bill,” who was particularly clever at hating Indians, and\r\nwhenever an ambush was preparing “Whiskey Bill” would select four or\r\nfive other men equally clever and go after the Indians. He often killed\r\nand scalped as many as four in one ambush, and sold their scalps in\r\nDenver to the Jews for a suit of clothes each. The Jews bought them as\r\nrelics and disposed of them in the East. The killing of Indians in this\r\nmanner was according to Government order and strictly legitimate.\r\nAnother driver in Howell’s train was an Atchison man named Rube Duggan.\r\nHe was a great roper and used to take a horse, when in sight of a\r\nbuffalo herd and go out after calves, which made tender meat. Riding\r\ninto the herd he would lasso a calf, fasten the rope to the ground with\r\na stake and then go on after another one before the herd got away. He\r\ncaught several calves in this way for Ben Holladay, who took them east.\r\nMr. Howell remembers that once, this side of Fort Kearney, it was\r\nnecessary to stop the train to let a herd of buffalo pass. The men\r\nalways had fresh buffalo meat in addition to their bacon, beans, dried\r\napples, rice and fried bread.\r\n\r\nThere was a cook with the train who drove the mess wagon, but he did not\r\ndo any other work. Every driver had to take his turn getting wood and\r\nwater for the cook and herding the cattle at noon, but the night herder\r\ndid nothing else and slept in the wagon during the day. Occasionally he\r\nwas awakened about noon and hunted along the road. The cattle fed at\r\nnight until 10 or 11 o’clock when they would lie down until 2 in the\r\nmorning. The night herder would lie down by the side of a reliable old\r\nox and sleep too, being awakened when the ox got up to feed. The oxen\r\nwere driven into the wagon corral about daylight and yoked. Every wagon\r\nhad its specified place in the train and kept it during the entire trip.\r\n\r\nWagons were always left in a circle at night, forming a corral. Into\r\nthis corral the cattle were driven while being yoked. In case of an\r\nattack, the cattle were inside the corral and the men fought under the\r\nwagons. The teams started at daylight and stopped at 10 or 11 until 2 or\r\n3, and then they would start up and travel until dark. Mr. Howell always\r\nrested on Sunday, making an average of 100 miles a week with his ox\r\nteams. When the train started out each man was given ten pounds of sugar\r\nwhich was to last him to Denver. On the first Sunday the men would make\r\nlemonade of sugar and vinegar and do without sugar the rest of the trip.\r\nMr. Howell saw the attack on George W. Howe’s train on the Little Blue\r\nwhen George Con—— was killed and the entire train burned. Con—— was an\r\nAtchison man. Howell’s train was corraled and he could not go to Howe’s\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nHowell came to Atchison county in 1856 by wagon from Fayette county,\r\nPennsylvania, where he was born, December 26, 1824. At seventy he was\r\nstout and vigorous, getting up every morning at 4 o’clock to go to work.\r\nHis plains experience did him good. He died on the 1st day of August,\r\n1907, owning a large tract of land in Grasshopper township.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BELA M. HUGHES\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ELLSWORTH CHESEBOROUGH\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN W. CAIN.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Cain and his two sons, John S. Cain and William S. Cain, came to\r\nAtchison in 1856 from the Isle of Man, and preëmpted a quarter section,\r\nfive miles west of Atchison. A. D. Cain, another son, came to this\r\ncounty in 1856, accompanying his brother, John M. Cain, who had gone to\r\nhis old home in the Isle of Man on a visit. A. D. Cain attended school\r\nlonger than either of his three brothers and was a graduate of King\r\nWilliam’s College, a celebrated institution of learning. After leaving\r\nschool he learned the business of a druggist. He was born in 1846. John\r\nM. Cain was seven years older.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Cain enlisted in the Thirteenth Kansas infantry in 1862. His\r\nbrother, William, enlisted in Col. John A. Martin’s regiment the year\r\nbefore. In less than a year John M. Cain was given the position as\r\ncaptain in the Eighty-third U. S. infantry and raised Company C in\r\nAtchison. Phillip Porter, the celebrated negro politician and orator, of\r\nAtchison, was orderly sergeant of Company C, which had ten men killed in\r\nthe battle of Prairie Grove. After serving in the army nearly four\r\nyears, John M. Cain returned to his farm in Atchison county in 1866\r\nwhere he remained until 1872, when he removed to Atchison and engaged in\r\nthe grain business. The Cains started the exporting of flour from Kansas\r\nand their business was very largely export business during their\r\noperation of the mill.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Cain, father of the Cain brothers, was a fierce Free State man\r\nin the days when it was dangerous to be a Free State man in Atchison\r\ncounty, but as he was a powerful man and of undoubted courage, the pro-\r\nslavery fans thought it wise to forgive him. His memory as well as the\r\nmemory of his sons, John M. Cain and A. D. Cain, are still highly\r\nesteemed by the older settlers of Atchison county.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DR. W. L. CHALLISS.\r\n\r\nDr. W. L. Challiss came to Atchison June 3, 1866, on the steamboat\r\n“Meteor” from Moorestown, N. J., where he had been a practicing\r\nphysician. At that time John Alcorn was operating a horse ferry on the\r\nriver and Dr. Challiss, in company with his brother, L. C. Challiss,\r\npurchased a three-fourths interest in the ferry franchise after\r\noperating a little rival ferry for a time, which was known as the “Red\r\nRover.” The price paid for the franchise was $1,800.00.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1856 Dr. Challiss went to Evansville, Ind., and\r\ncontracted for the building of a steam ferry. This was completed in\r\nNovember and started for Atchison. In December it was frozen up in the\r\nMissouri river at Carrollton, Mo., and left in charge of a watchman. The\r\ncrew was made up of old acquaintances of Dr. Challiss in New Jersey, and\r\nthese he brought to Atchison in two stage coaches hired for the purpose.\r\n\r\nOn February 7 of the following year Dr. Challiss started down the river\r\non horse back after his ferry boat, accompanied by George M. Million,\r\nGranville Morrow and John Cafferty. There had been a thaw and a rise in\r\nthe river, and when the men reached the vicinity of Carrollton they\r\nlearned that the boat had gone adrift. They followed it down the river,\r\nhearing of it occasionally and finally came up with it in sight of Arrow\r\nRock. The boat had grounded on a bar and a man was in possession,\r\nclaiming salvage. Dr. Challiss caught the man off the boat, took\r\npossession and settled with him for $25.00. A story was circulated that\r\nthere had been small-pox on the boat and it narrowly escaped burning at\r\nthe hands of the people living in the vicinity. Dr. Challiss went on\r\ndown the river and met his family at St. Louis. When the steamer on\r\nwhich they were passengers reached Arrow Rock, the captain was induced\r\nto pull the ferry off the sand bar, and within four days it arrived in\r\nAtchison.\r\n\r\nThis boat was named the “Ida” for Dr. Challiss’ oldest daughter, who\r\nbecame the wife of John A. Martin, editor of the _Atchison Champion_,\r\ncolonel of the Eighth Kansas regiment and governor of the State two\r\nterms. The “Ida” was brought up the river by George Million and\r\nGranville Morrow, pilots, and John Cafferty, engineer. George Million\r\nwas the captain when it began making regular trips as a ferry, receiving\r\noriginally $50.00 per month. During the last years of his service he\r\nreceived $125.00 a month. The ferry boat business was very profitable\r\nand $100.00 per day was no unusual income. In 1860 Dr. Challiss built a\r\nlarger ferry at Brownsville, Penn., and called it the “J. G. Morrow.”\r\nWhen it arrived at Atchison the Government pressed it into service and\r\nsent it to Yankton with Indian supplies. Bill Reed was pilot and Dr.\r\nChalliss, captain. A quick trip was made to within seventy miles of\r\nYankton where the pilot ran the boat into a snag and sank it. The boat\r\ncost $25,000.00 and nothing was saved but the machinery. This was\r\nafterwards placed in the ferry “S. C. Pomeroy,” which was operated here\r\nuntil the bridge was completed in 1877. After this the “S. C. Pomeroy\r\nwas taken to Kansas City, where it sank during a storm. S. C. Pomeroy\r\nowned a one-fourth interest in the “J. G. Morrow” and “S. C. Pomeroy”\r\nand the wreck of the “Morrow” cost him $5,000.00.\r\n\r\nThe “Ida” was taken to Leavenworth on the completion of the bridge and\r\nwas in service there many years.\r\n\r\nIn the early days Dr. Challiss was a Free State man and for years he had\r\nin his possession a letter warning him to leave the country, which was\r\nwritten during the exciting period before the war. Dr. Challiss remained\r\nactive in the affairs of the town for many years but practiced his\r\nprofession only spasmodically. He died in Dayton, Ohio, at the home of\r\nhis daughter, on April 23, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GEORGE SCARBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nGeorge Scarborough was one of the most romantic characters that ever\r\nlived in Atchison county. Influenced by his niece’s description of\r\nKansas, he came to Sumner in 1859 and purchased a tract of land now\r\nowned by E. W. Howe and known as Potato Hill. The location is probably\r\nthe finest on the Missouri river. The farm lies on top of the bluff, and\r\nScarborough’s house was built near the river. He was well fitted to\r\nenjoy the life of elegant leisure and seclusion, which he did. Early in\r\nlife he went to Kentucky from Connecticut and taught school. While there\r\nhe married the daughter of a congressman named Triplett. The wife died a\r\nyear later, and Scarborough came into possession of considerable money.\r\nAfter that he adopted a literary and scientific life and spent much of\r\nhis time abroad, where he collected many pictures and other art\r\ntreasures. These were displayed in his home below Sumner. Scarborough\r\nwas a botanist, and made a complete collection of the flora of this\r\nsection, which he sent to the Smithsonian Institution, at Washington.\r\nOne of his discoveries was that Atchison county had eleven varieties of\r\nthe oak. Scarborough was one of the original founders of the First\r\nNational Bank of this city, furnishing most of the original capital.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 he went to Vineland, N. J., where he married a girl of twenty-\r\nthree, although he was nearly seventy. His wife died within a year, in\r\nchild birth, under precisely the same circumstances as his first wife.\r\nScarborough died in 1883, in his old home in Connecticut, in absolute\r\npoverty, at the age of eighty-four. He is spoken of as one of the most\r\nelegant gentlemen who distinguished the early days.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SAMUEL HOLLISTER.\r\n\r\nSamuel Hollister was one of the original settlers of Sumner. He landed\r\nat Leavenworth May 1, 1857, coming by boat from Jefferson City. Two\r\nweeks later he met a number of the members of the Sumner Town Company\r\nwho were looking for somebody to go to Sumner to build a hotel. Having\r\nbeen a contractor and builder in his old home in New Jersey, Mr.\r\nHollister accompanied the men to Sumner, which then consisted of a claim\r\ncabin, used as a hotel, and four frame houses in course of construction.\r\nThe material for the frame houses had been brought from Cincinnati,\r\nready framed, and when completed were 16×24, containing two rooms each.\r\nMr. Hollister took the contract to build the Baker House, which\r\ncontained three rooms on the ground floor. The half story above was all\r\nin one room, where the guests slept. The frames for the Baker House were\r\nhewn out in the timber adjoining the town; the weather boarding and\r\nshingles were shipped up the river. The hotel was completed in the\r\nsummer of 1857, and was operated by Hood Baker, a cousin of Capt. David\r\nBaker, for many years a prominent citizen of Atchison.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of the same year Mr. Hollister began work on the Sumner\r\nHouse, the contract price being $16,000.00. The brick used were made on\r\nthe ground. The lumber came by boat from Pittsburgh, Penn. This hotel\r\nwas completed in the summer of the following year. It was built by the\r\ntown company, which owed Mr. Hollister $3,000.00 at the time of his\r\ndeath, a few years ago.\r\n\r\nMr. Hollister lived in Sumner twelve years, vigorously fighting\r\nAtchison. In the fall of 1858 he built a mill, in company with Al\r\nBarber, later adding a gristmill, which was the second built in the\r\ncounty, the first having been built in Atchison, by William Bowman. Mr.\r\nHollister went down the river in a boat in January, 1859, and when he\r\nreached his old home in the Catskill mountains, he crossed the Hudson\r\nriver on the ice. During this trip east he was married to Miss Harriet\r\nCarroll, a lineal descendant of Charles Carroll, one of the signers of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence. His wife returned with him to Sumner,\r\nand they afterwards moved to Atchison, where they lived for many years.\r\nMr. Hollister died March 28, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor, who for many years lived on a farm immediately south of the\r\nState Orphans’ Home, was a resident of Missouri, a mile and a quarter\r\nabove East Atchison in 1844, ten years before Kansas was opened for\r\nsettlement. His father, Joseph Taylor, came to the Platte Purchase in\r\n1838, from Pennsylvania, settling near Weston. At that time most of the\r\nbest claims were taken. John Taylor’s recollection was that the very\r\nearliest settler in that vicinity was in 1837. Joseph Taylor did not\r\nsecure a very good claim, and afterward removed to Andrew county,\r\nfinally locating a mile above East Atchison, in 1844. John Taylor said\r\nthat George Million was living on the present site of East Atchison when\r\nhis father’s family settled in the bottom. It was Mr. Taylor’s opinion\r\nthat George Million settled in East Atchison in 1842, and that he did\r\nnot start his ferry until 1850. In the spring of that year John Taylor\r\ncrossed the river on George Million’s flat-boat ferry, and went to\r\nCalifornia, in company with his brother, Joe. There was no wagon road\r\nrunning west from Atchison at that time. John and Joe Taylor mined in\r\nCalifornia for eighteen months, never making over $20.00 per day, and\r\nusually only $5.00. They returned home by the way of the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, and John Taylor got the small-pox at Glascow, Mo., which did not\r\nbreak out on him until he reached East Atchison. This was supposed to be\r\nthe first case of small-pox in this section of the country. All the\r\nother members of the family got it, and the wife of Jim Stultz, who came\r\nin to help his mother, also got it. Their physician was a Doctor Ankrom,\r\nwho lived in the Narrows, near Rushville, and he got it, too. This was\r\nin the winter of 1851 and 1852. In September, 1854, ten years after\r\nsettling in East Atchison, Mr. Taylor came to this side of the river.\r\nWhen he arrived Ladd Yocum was running a hotel in a tent; there was\r\nnothing else on the town site. Late in the fall George T. Challiss\r\ncompleted his store, which was the first building of any kind in\r\nAtchison, according to Mr. Taylor. He says that George Million did not\r\nerect his claim shanty until the following year.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor first settled in the bluffs, northeast of Atchison, but\r\nafterwards moved to a tract of land owned by a man named O. B.\r\nDickerson, who afterwards built the first livery stable in Atchison.\r\nDickerson sold his claim to a man named Adams, B. T. Stringfellow’s\r\nfather-in-law, for $600.00, but Adams did not comply with the law and\r\nTaylor jumped it. For a while Taylor and Adams lived on the same\r\nquarter, and became acquainted; then Taylor discovered that Adams paid\r\n$600.00 for the claim, and gave him his money back. Taylor said he never\r\nhad any short words with Adams about the claim, but once. They met on\r\nthe hill, overlooking the river, one day, and were looking at the wreck\r\nof the old “Pontiac,” which is now said to have contained several\r\nhundred barrels of whiskey. “Well,” said Adams, “when are you going?”\r\n“Going where?” asked Taylor. “To Nova Scotia,” replied Adams. “I am not\r\ngoing at all,” was Taylor’s response, which Adams understood to mean\r\nthat he was not going to leave the claim, but intended to fight. A\r\ncompromise soon followed.\r\n\r\nTaylor says the “Pontiac” was carried off by Atchison people, and put\r\ninto their houses, and that years afterwards, the writing on the wheel\r\nhouse could be seen around town. There was no whiskey left in the hold;\r\nindeed, the hold was carried away.\r\n\r\nThe Taylor place was considered a great deal more valuable in 1855 than\r\nit is now; people felt sure that within four or five years John Taylor\r\nwould cut it up in town lots and sell them at fabulous prices, and go\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor’s sympathies were always with the South Carolinians, who\r\nmade this section so warm in 1856, but said that only one in ten were\r\ngood citizens; the others were toughs. One of them, a man named Newhall,\r\nwas killed in the fight at Hickory Point. John Robinson, captain of a\r\nsouthern party at Hickory Point, was an Atchison man, and was shot in\r\nthe hip.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor said that in 1844 and several years later the country was\r\nfull of bee trees, and that cattle turned into the rush in the river\r\nbottom in winter, came out fat in the spring. In 1844 there was a\r\nsettlement of fifty Kickapoo families on the flat just above the island\r\non the Kansas side. They made a great deal of maple sugar. In summer\r\nthese Indians went out to the buffalo grounds, sixty to eighty miles\r\nwest of the river, returning in the fall, to be near the Missouri\r\nsettlers. There never was an Indian village on the site of Atchison,\r\nalthough Mrs. Joe Wade, who was George Million’s daughter, claims to\r\nhave remembered coming to this side of the river when she was a little\r\ngirl, and seeing a dead Indian strapped to a board and leaning against a\r\ntree on the present site of Commercial street. The body was surrounded\r\nwith totem poles. There was no game at that time on this side of the\r\nriver. Indians themselves hunted deer on the Missouri side in winter,\r\nand were very friendly with the whites.\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor died on March 7, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOHN M. CROWELL.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Crowell was mayor of Atchison three terms, coming to the city in\r\n1858 from Londonderry, N. H., where he was born October 22, 1823. For\r\nten years he was a merchant here, afterwards being appointed Government\r\nstorekeeper, and having charge of a distillery below town. From 1870 to\r\n1885, he was United States postoffice inspector for nineteen States and\r\nTerritories, and in that capacity visited every section of the country.\r\nHe resigned to become a mail contractor, although solicited by a\r\nDemocratic postmaster general to remain. His record in Washington was as\r\ngood as that of any man who ever worked for the Government. Mr. Crowell\r\nwas a forty-niner, crossing the plains during the great rush of that\r\nyear, and engaging in sluice mining. He made four trips to California,\r\nbut never by railroad. From San Francisco he visited China, South\r\nAmerica, the Sandwich Islands, and was a great traveler in his time. He\r\nwas the father of Frank G. Crowell, who was born in Atchison, and for\r\nmany years a prominent citizen here, but later resigning his position as\r\ncounty attorney of Atchison county and moving to Kansas City to engage\r\nin the grain business, where he now lives.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Crowell’s daughter became Mrs. F. M. Baker, who accumulated a\r\nfortune in the grain business in Atchison. Mr. Crowell died on the\r\neleventh day of October, 1902.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GEORGE MILLION\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM SCARBROUGH\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LUTHER DICKERSON.\r\n\r\nLuther Dickerson came to Atchison county in June, 1854, immediately\r\nafter Kansas was opened to settlement, from Saline county, Missouri,\r\nwhere he had lived ten years. He went to Missouri from Washington\r\ncounty, Ohio, where he was born in 1825. After looking over the country\r\nMr. Dickerson returned to Missouri, but came back to Kansas the\r\nfollowing October, and “squatted” on a tract of land a mile north of the\r\nState Orphans’ Home. From 1854 to 1857 were the squatter sovereignty\r\ndays, during which period a settler could have no title to land, further\r\nthan the fact of his settlement on the land he selected as his home.\r\nLand offices were not established until in 1857, when the squatter filed\r\nhis claims, and began fighting over them. The first land office in this\r\nsection was at Doniphan. John W. Whitfield, who was afterwards in\r\nCongress, was the register. About a year later the land office was\r\nremoved to Kickapoo, just below Atchison.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Dickerson squatted on his claim in 1854, three-fourths of the\r\nland around him was taken. Welcome Nance, Peter Cummings, John Taylor\r\nand Widow Boyle had farms at that time. Andy Colgan did not come until\r\n1857. The settlers of 1854 were mostly from Missouri. In 1855 came an\r\norganized band of South Carolinians, whose object was to make Kansas a\r\nslave State. Then followed the fierce and relentless fight with the Free\r\nState men, which ended in 1857, as far as this section was concerned.\r\nThat is, in 1857 the Free State men won control, and have practically\r\nkept it ever since. In the fall of that year the Free State men elected\r\ntheir county ticket, and Luther Dickerson was chosen as one of the four\r\ncommissioners and was made chairman.\r\n\r\nLuther Dickerson was a Free State man and was fought by all the Missouri\r\nand South Carolinians. His land was contested, and he was beaten in the\r\nland office, but he finally won before the secretary of the interior, by\r\nproving that the woman who was contesting him was a foreigner. Hiram\r\nLatham, a Free State man, who lived across the road from Dickerson, was\r\nmurdered in Doniphan, and because of this murder Frank McVey left the\r\ncountry and never came back. The men who killed Latham were ferried over\r\nIndependence creek by Dickerson, and, noticing that they were armed, he\r\nasked where they were going. They said they were going wolf hunting. In\r\n1858 Luther Dickerson was elected a member of the house of\r\nrepresentatives, which met at Lecompton, and then adjourned to Lawrence.\r\nIn the same year, while still a county commissioner, he built the old\r\ncourt house, which occupied the site of the present court house.\r\n\r\nLuther Dickerson raised the first company of soldiers ever organized in\r\nthe State of Kansas, in May, 1861. The first military order issued in\r\nthe State was directed to him, signed by John A. Martin, assistant\r\nadjutant general.\r\n\r\nBut while his company was the first organized, it happened that\r\nDickerson’s commission as captain was the second issued, and was signed\r\nby Governor Charles Robinson, before the State had an official seal.\r\nAfterwards, Mr. Dickerson served in the regular volunteer service, as\r\nfirst lieutenant.\r\n\r\nHe lived on his land, north of town, for many years, and died in\r\nAtchison on the thirteenth day of December, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LUTHER C. CHALLISS.\r\n\r\nLuther C. Challiss came to Atchison in 1855 from Boonville, Mo., where\r\nhe was engaged as a merchant. He remained here continuously until 1861\r\nas merchant, banker, ferry operator and real estate owner. Luther C.\r\nChalliss’ addition, the east line of which is at the alley between\r\nSeventh and Eighth streets, was preëmpted by Mr. Challiss in 1857, and\r\nwas originally composed of 198 acres.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the Territorial council, Mr. Challiss secured the first\r\ncharter for a railroad west from Atchison, known as the Atchison Pike’s\r\nPeak railroad, now the Central Branch. He was the first president of the\r\nroad, and originally owned every dollar of the stock. He also managed\r\nthe Kickapoo treaty, which gave the road 150,000 acres of land, and made\r\nit prominent in Washington as a specific possibility. The original\r\nGovernment subsidy for this road was every other quarter section of land\r\nfor ten miles on either side, in addition to $16,000 to $48,000 per\r\nmile, in Government bonds.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Mr. Challiss secured a charter for the Atchison-Pike’s\r\nPeak railroad, he secured a charter for the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe\r\nrailroad, his original idea being a southern route to the Pacific, and\r\nthat road has fulfilled all of his early expectations.\r\n\r\nMr. Challiss made a great deal of money in Atchison, and in 1864 drifted\r\nto New York and Washington, where he became an operator on the stock\r\nexchange. Mr. Challiss’ sympathies were with the South, and was\r\ngenerally a bull. As long as the South showed its ability to hold out\r\nMr. Challiss made a great deal of money, and at one time he had on\r\ndeposit in New York $960,000, but the tide turned against him when the\r\nSouth began to fail, and this fortune was reduced to nothing.\r\n\r\nAs an operator on Wall street at that time, Mr. Challiss outranked Jim\r\nFisk and Jay Gould, and was the peer of Anthony Morse and the Jeromes.\r\nJay Gould was a very common man at that time, compared to Mr. Challiss,\r\nand a very little thing might have made Mr. Challiss one of the great\r\nfinancial leaders in America. An incident in his career in New York was\r\nthe attempt of Woodhull & Claflin to break him. He made a fight that is\r\nstill remembered, and sent Woodhull and Claflin, Colonel Blood Stephen,\r\nPearl Andrews and George Francis Train to jail, where they remained six\r\nmonths. Finally they left the country as a result of a compromise. Mr.\r\nChalliss’ lawyers were Roger A. Pryor and Judge Fullerton. Judge\r\nFullerton received a quarter section of land in Atchison county as his\r\nfee. Mr. Challiss also brought the famous Pacific Mail suit, which was\r\nequally famous.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Atchison in 1878, looking after the wreck of his former\r\npossessions. For three years he edited the _Atchison Champion_, and\r\nbitterly opposed John J. Ingalls for United States senator in 1890.\r\n\r\nMr. Challiss, in his latter years, became a very much abused man, and\r\nwas looked upon as one of the unpopular citizens of the town, but it may\r\nbe said to his credit that he did much for Atchison, and was largely\r\nresponsible for making the town the terminus of the Hannibal & St. Joe\r\nrailroad. He brought Jay Gould, Henry N. Smith and Ben Carver to\r\nAtchison, and they agreed to extend the road from St. Joseph to\r\nAtchison, in consideration of $75,000.00 in Atchison bonds, which was\r\nagreed to. Mr. Challiss had some sort of a deal with Henry N. Smith\r\nwhile they were operating on Wall street, and Challiss claimed that\r\nSmith owned him $107,000.00. They finally settled the matter, by Smith\r\nagreeing to bring the Hannibal & St. Joseph road here without the\r\n$75,000.00 in bonds the people had agreed to give him. The _Atchison\r\nChampion_ of May 11, 1872, contained a half column scare head, to the\r\neffect that Luther C. Challiss telegraphed from New York that the bridge\r\nhad been finally secured, and gave the credit of securing the bridge to\r\nChalliss and James N. Burnes.\r\n\r\nMr. Challiss died a poor man on the sixth day of July, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GEORGE W. GLICK.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Glick, the ninth governor of Kansas, for a number of years\r\nUnited States pension agent for the district comprising Kansas,\r\nMissouri, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Indian Territory, came to\r\nAtchison in June, 1859, from Fremont, Ohio, where he studied law in the\r\noffice of Rutherford B. Hayes, who afterwards became President of the\r\nUnited States. Mr. Glick came to Atchison on the steamer “Wm. H.\r\nRussell,” named for and largely owned by William H. Russell, senior\r\nmember of the celebrated freighting firm of Russell, Majors & Waddell.\r\nMr. Glick was born in Fairfield county, Ohio, July 4, 1829, on a farm,\r\nand when four years old removed with his father’s family to within a\r\nmile and a half of Fremont, where he remained until he came to Atchison.\r\nHe first went to school in the country, near Fremont, where he\r\nafterwards taught when he was nineteen. Later he attended a Dioclesion\r\nschool at Fremont, founded by Dr. Dio Lewis, who afterwards became\r\nfamous and whose name then was Dioclesia Lewis. Later he attended\r\nCentral College, Ohio, but did not graduate. In 1849 he began the study\r\nof law in the office of Bucklin & Hayes, in Fremont, as a result of\r\ngetting his feet in a threshing machine. It was supposed that he would\r\nnever be fit for farm work again, but he afterwards recovered. Two years\r\nlater he was admitted to the bar in Cincinnati, standing an examination\r\nwith the graduating class of the Cincinnati law school. He practiced\r\neight years in Fremont before coming to Atchison, building up a good\r\nbusiness, in spite of the fact that he always went out to the farm in\r\nhaying time and harvested and helped his father. In January, following\r\nhis arrival in Atchison, he formed a partnership with A. G. Otis, which\r\ncontinued as long as he practiced law. The firm of Otis & Glick was the\r\nstrongest in Atchison, as long as it lasted, and B. P. Waggener was a\r\nstudent in their office. In 1872 Mr. Glick became a town farmer,\r\noperating a farm of 640 acres four miles west of Atchison, making a\r\nspecialty of Short Horn cattle, paying as high as $1,000 for several\r\nsingle animals. He served nine terms in the Kansas legislature, and was\r\nonce county commissioner, and once county auditor of Atchison county.\r\nWhile auditor of Atchison county, in 1882, he was elected governor, by\r\n9,000 plurality, over Jim P. St. John, who had been elected two years\r\nbefore by about 55,000. In 1884 he was re-nominated as governor by the\r\nDemocrats, but was defeated by John A. Martin. He first received the\r\nnomination for governor nine years after coming to Kansas, but was\r\ndefeated by the Republicans. He was appointed pension agent in 1885, and\r\nagain in 1893. He was a Mason, and was one of the original organizers of\r\nthe Knight Templars and Royal Arch Masons, in Atchison. He was the first\r\npresident of the Atchison-Nebraska road, having built it to the county\r\nline, in connection with Brown and Bier. Governor Glick sold his farm\r\nnear Shannon a number of years ago, and during the latter part of his\r\nlife was inactive in business and professional affairs. He died on the\r\nthirteenth day of April, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DR. W. K. GRIMES.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest citizens of Atchison was Dr. W. H. Grimes, who came\r\nhere from Yellow Spring, Ohio, in 1858. His son, E. B. Grimes, came a\r\nyear before, and opened a drug store in the building for many years\r\noccupied as an office by the Atchison Water Company, across from the\r\nByram Hotel. Dr. W. H. Grimes practiced medicine until the war broke\r\nout, when he became a surgeon in the Thirteenth Kansas. Returning to\r\nAtchison at the close of the war, he continued the practice of medicine\r\nuntil his death, in 1879.\r\n\r\nE. B. Grimes was a quartermaster during the war with a rank of major. At\r\nthe close of the war he entered the regular army, and built many of the\r\nposts in the Department of the Platte, notably Ft. Laramie, Ft.\r\nFetterman and Ft. Douglass. He died at Ft. Leavenworth, in 1882.\r\n\r\nAnother son, Dr. R. V. Grimes, was a lieutenant in his father’s\r\nregiment. After the war he became an army surgeon, and was in many of\r\nthe Indian campaigns in the Northwest. He was in Merritt’s command when\r\nit went to the rescue of General Custer, and was the surgeon in Major\r\nThornburg’s command when it was surrounded at the famous fight on Milk\r\nriver. The command was surrounded five days by the Utes, and was finally\r\nrescued by General Merritt. While he lived in Atchison he was employed\r\nas a printer on the _Champion_.\r\n\r\nTwo other sons of Dr. Grimes, John and Howard Grimes, were members of\r\nColonel Jennison’s Seventh Kansas Jayhawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOSHUA WHEELER.\r\n\r\nJoshua Wheeler was one of the best known, as well as one of the most\r\nsuccessful, farmers Atchison county ever had. His papers on questions\r\npertaining to agriculture and the farm, read before the various\r\nsocieties, attracted wide-spread attention. In State affairs, he served\r\nthe public long and honorably, and for over twenty years was a member of\r\nthe State board of agriculture, serving three years as its president.\r\nHis long connection with the State Agriculture College gave him an\r\nextended acquaintance over the State, and he was appointed regent for\r\nthat institution by Governor Harvey in 1871, and re-appointed by\r\nGovernor Martin in 1888, serving until April, 1894. During several years\r\nof that time he was treasurer of the board, and gained an extensive\r\nknowledge of the college and its history. He served in the State senate\r\nduring 1863 and 1864 and in the fall of 1885 was elected for another\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nJoshua Wheeler was born in Buckingham, England, February 12, 1827, and\r\ncame to America in 1844, locating in New Jersey, where he resided four\r\nyears before removing to Illinois. In 1857 a colony of seven or eight\r\nfamilies of Fulton county, Illinois, farmers, Seventh-Day Baptists, came\r\nto Kansas, and located in the southwest portion of Atchison county,\r\ncovering the entire distance overland. S. P. Griffin and Dennis Sounders\r\npreceded the colony in the spring of the same year to look up a\r\nlocation. They went as far to the southwest as Emporia, but found no\r\nland equal to that of Atchison county. After locating the land for the\r\ncolony they went back to Illinois, but did not accompany the colony to\r\nKansas, but came a year or two later. Griffin farmed for nearly twenty\r\nyears, but afterwards became a Nortonville merchant. He was the father\r\nof Charles T. Griffin, at one time an attorney in Atchison.\r\n\r\nWhen the colony of Seventh-Day people arrived at the end of their\r\ndestination they found the land in possession of colonists, but they\r\nbought them out, preëmpted claims and laid out the now famous Seventh-\r\nDay Lane. The land was then an open prairie, occupied only by an\r\noccasional hut. It is at this time the admiration of every visitor\r\nabounding in well cultivated fields, pastures, groves, orchards,\r\ncomfortable homes, to which paint is no stranger, large barns, uniformly\r\ntrimmed hedges, and peopled by as thrifty a class as can be found in the\r\nwestern country. Later on Seventh-Day people came from Iowa, Wisconsin\r\nand New York, and joined the Illinois colony on Seventh-Day Lane, which\r\nis two miles in length. The Seventh-Day Baptists observe their Sabbath\r\nfrom sundown Friday evening to sundown Saturday evening. Their church\r\nhas a seating capacity of 400, which is always comfortably filled, and\r\nwas built in 1884, prior to which time the Seventh-Day Baptists\r\nworshiped in their school house.\r\n\r\nA. A. Randolph was the first pastor of the church on Seventh-Day Lane.\r\nHe came here from Pennsylvania in 1863, and died in 1868. S. R. Wheeler,\r\na brother of Joshua Wheeler, was pastor of the church for twelve years.\r\n\r\nWhen the Seventh-Day Baptists built their homes on the Lane smooth wire\r\ncost eleven and one-half cents per pound in Atchison, and ordinary\r\nflooring, $100.00 per thousand feet. Money was loaned at four per cent.\r\nper month. They did all of their trading in Atchison until Nortonville\r\nwas built.\r\n\r\nJoshua Wheeler was not only a successful farmer, but a good business\r\nman. He kept a regular set of books, and could always tell exactly what\r\nit cost him to produce a bushel of wheat in any of the different years\r\nof his farm experience. He could tell also what a bushel of corn, fed to\r\ncattle, would produce. In 1877 he sold his wheat for $1.75 per bushel.\r\n\r\nHe owned a farm of over 300 acres, just at the west end of the Lane,\r\nwhere he died on the fourteenth day of May, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WILLIAM HETHERINGTON.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hetherington, founder of the Exchange National Bank, came to\r\nAtchison in 1859, from Pottsville, Penn., where he operated a flouring\r\nmill. His three oldest children, Mrs. B. P. Waggener, W. W. Hetherington\r\nand C. S. Hetherington, were born in Pottsville. Mrs. W. A. Otis, the\r\nyoungest daughter, was born in Atchison. William Hetherington himself\r\nwas born in Milton, Penn., May 10, 1821. He was also married there. When\r\nhe first came west he stopped in St. Louis, then went to Kansas City,\r\nand later to Leavenworth, where he bought a bankrupt stock of goods and\r\nhauled them to Atchison in wagons. This was in 1859. The same year he\r\nestablished the Exchange Bank of William Hetherington, absorbing the\r\nKansas Valley Bank, owned by Robert L. Pease, which had been established\r\nseveral years before.\r\n\r\nMr. Hetherington’s influence in Atchison was very marked. He was a\r\ncultured gentleman of the old school, and was so generally respected,\r\nalthough always a Democrat, he stood very high in the sixties when the\r\nsectional bitterness was at its height, and did much to maintain peace\r\nbetween the contending factions. He was a very able public speaker. He\r\nwas never a bitter partisan, and enjoyed the respect of the people to an\r\nunusual degree. He was one of the early mayors of Atchison, and had a\r\nsuccessful career. He died on the twenty-first day of January, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM C. SMITH.\r\n\r\nWilliam C. Smith, one of the early mayors of Atchison, came to Kansas in\r\n1858 from Illinois, settling near Valley Falls. Two years later he\r\ntraded his farm to Sam Dickson for a stock of goods in Atchison and\r\nremoved to this city. The firm of William C. Smith & Son continued\r\nsixteen years. The son was Henry T. Smith, who still resides in Atchison\r\n(1915). Another son is William R. Smith, who is at present the attorney\r\nfor the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, at Topeka, for a\r\nnumber of years was a justice of the supreme court of Kansas. His oldest\r\ndaughter married P. L. Hubbard, who afterwards became district judge of\r\nAtchison county, and another daughter married H. C. Solomon, for many\r\nyears a leading attorney of Atchison. Mr. Smith died in 1884. He was\r\nmayor two terms; member of the legislature, council and the board of\r\neducation. Although Mr. Smith came to Kansas from Illinois, he was born\r\nat Columbus, Ohio, in 1817.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN M. PRICE.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Price arrived in Atchison with his wife on the first of\r\nSeptember, 1858, the day the Massasoit House was formally opened for the\r\npublic. They came here from Platte City, Mo., to visit some old friends\r\nfrom Kentucky, who had moved to Kansas, and after they arrived concluded\r\nto remain. The Prices originally came from Irvine, Ky. Mr. Price studied\r\nlaw in Irvine; was admitted and elected county attorney before coming to\r\nAtchison. He was a Union man, in spite of the fact that he came from\r\nKentucky, and was very active in a business and professional way during\r\nthe early days of his residence in this county, and for many years\r\nthereafter. He constructed more large and substantial buildings in\r\nAtchison than any other individual who ever lived here. He built the\r\nhouse for a residence, now occupied by Mt. St. Scholastica Academy, an\r\nopera house and many blocks of business buildings and residences. He was\r\na member of the legislature several times; was prominently mentioned as\r\na candidate for United States senator. Mr. Price died on the twentieth\r\nday of October, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SAMUEL C. KING.\r\n\r\nSamuel C. King came to Atchison March 27, 1857. His brothers, Ed. and\r\nJohn, together with a sister and his widowed mother, arrived here the\r\nyear before, coming here with Dr. W. L. Challiss, in the steam ferry,\r\n“Ida,” from Brownsville, Penn., where that boat was built. The King\r\nfamily came originally from England, within thirty-five miles of\r\nLiverpool, where the children were born, and where the father died. Ed.\r\nKing was the first pilot of the ferry boat, “Ida,” when it began making\r\ntrips to Atchison. The three sons and the mother took up claims in Mt.\r\nPleasant township. While living there three old neighbors came out and\r\nSamuel C. King went out with them to look for claims. They were told\r\nthat there was plenty of vacant land near Monrovia, but Mr. King advised\r\nthem that it was too far out in the wilderness, and they went elsewhere.\r\n(Monrovia is fourteen miles from Atchison). While the other members of\r\nthe family were getting their start Samuel C. King clerked in George T.\r\nChalliss’ store, receiving $25.00 per month, and boarded himself. He\r\nafterwards went to work for Mike Finney, steamboat wharf master, and was\r\npractically the first express agent in Atchison. Later he went out to\r\nhis farm and split rails to fence it, and afterwards clerked for Bowman\r\n& Blair for $25.00 per month and board. He enlisted in the navy in June,\r\n1861, enlisting as a landsman on the man of war, “Augusta.” He served on\r\nthis ship through all the exciting scenes of the navy during the war,\r\nand was at the battle of Point Royal. He assisted in capturing eight\r\nBritish ships, which tried to run the blockade, and his part of the\r\nprize money amounted to over $7,000.00. He was at the bombardment of Ft.\r\nSumpter, and at the taking of Tyble Island, off Savannah, Ga. He spent\r\neleven months at sea, working for the “Alabama,” and rounded Cape\r\nHatteras. He saw the burning of Charleston, and finally learning that\r\nhis mother was fatally ill, he came home. He was elected county\r\ntreasurer of Atchison county. Mr. King remained a prosperous capitalist\r\nand real estate operator, until his death on the twenty-third day of\r\nJanuary, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CLEM ROHR.\r\n\r\nClem Rohr came originally from Buffalo, N. Y., where he was born in\r\n1835. He learned the trade of harness maker there, and afterwards worked\r\nat his trade at Chicago, Detroit and Moline, Ill. In Davenport, Iowa, he\r\nheard Jim Lane make a speech about Kansas. This speech caused Rohr to go\r\nto Leavenworth in 1856, and while living in that town and employed as\r\nmail carrier he ran into the famous battle of Hickory Point. He slept in\r\nHickory Point the night after the fight and helped fix up the wounded.\r\nHe walked to Atchison in 1857 from Leavenworth, with Nick Greiner, for\r\nmany years a prosperous German farmer, south of Atchison, and started a\r\nharness shop, which he conducted in the same place on the south side of\r\nCommercial street, between Fourth and Fifth streets, for over forty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe first telegram that came to Atchison announcing that Kansas had been\r\nadmitted was sent to Clem Rohr, and was signed by S. C. Pomeroy. He\r\nserved as mayor of Atchison. Early in the sixties when the home guard\r\nwas organized in Atchison Clem Rohr was made captain. His father was one\r\nof Napoleon Bonaparte’s body-guard, and was with that great soldier at\r\nAusterlitz in the Russian campaign, and at the battle of Waterloo. Mr.\r\nRohr always claimed that Julius Newman, who had a farm near the\r\nSoldiers’ Home, made the first filing in the Lecompton land office.\r\n\r\nMr. Rohr died in Atchison on the twenty-third day of May, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            R. H. WEIGHTMAN.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and romantic early-day characters in\r\nAtchison county was Maj. R. H. Weightman, an ex-major of the United\r\nStates army, who was associated with a famous frontier tragedy. Major\r\nWeightman was a violent pro-slavery man and had been reared in the\r\nSouth. Before coming to Kickapoo, where he was connected with the land\r\noffice, and subsequently to Atchison, he was the editor of the _Herald_\r\nat Santa Fe, N. M., and also a delegate to Congress from that Territory.\r\n\r\nF. X. Aubrey, the other party to the quarrel, was a French Canadian, of\r\ngreat pluck and energy, and had made a reputation on a wager in 1852,\r\nriding from Santa Fe to Independence, Mo., in a few hours over eight\r\ndays. The next year he wagered $1,000 he could go the same distance in\r\nless than eight days. His bet was accepted and Aubrey covered the\r\ndistance in less than five days. Following these rides he engaged in the\r\nfreighting business over the plains and he and Major Weightman became\r\nwarm personal friends. Aubrey later made a trip to California, taking a\r\nherd of sheep, which he sold at a fine profit. It was upon his return\r\nfrom this trip that he and Weightman had their famous quarrel. The\r\nfairest account of this incident appeared in the _Missouri Republican_,\r\nSeptember 28, 1854, which was in the form of a communication from a\r\ncorrespondent of that paper, and was as follows:\r\n\r\n                     “THE CASE OF MAJOR WEIGHTMAN.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Editor: The deplorable event by which F. X. Aubrey lost his\r\n  life and which deprived the West of one of its most energetic and\r\n  able pioneers, will not be passed lightly over. The name of Mr.\r\n  Aubrey had become too closely identified with all that is gallant,\r\n  preserving, and—in a western sense, at least—brave and chivalrous,\r\n  that his memory and his sudden death should not awaken painful\r\n  emotions among all those to whom his name had become a household\r\n  word; emotions too painful to expect that, under his influence, full\r\n  justice would be done to both parties concerned. When, therefore, an\r\n  opportunity is afforded by which the facts, as nearly as we can\r\n  approach them, may be investigated, it would seem injustice to\r\n  withhold these facts from the public.\r\n\r\n  “Though, perhaps, less historically known (if the expression be\r\n  permitted) than Mr. Aubrey, Major Weightman has peculiar claims upon\r\n  the citizens of Missouri, and especially of St. Louis, for demanding\r\n  full and impartial justice in this behalf. Without wishing to\r\n  anticipate the judgment of your readers, or at all commenting upon\r\n  the evidence which will be found below, your correspondent, in view\r\n  of the grave charge in which Major Weightman is involved, and the\r\n  melancholy importance of the event, deems it his duty,\r\n  notwithstanding, here to state what may be known to most of your\r\n  readers, that Major Weightman, for years, formerly, was a resident\r\n  of St. Louis, beloved and respected, almost without any exception,\r\n  by all with whom he came in contact.\r\n\r\n  “Amongst the many of Missouri’s citizens who participated in the\r\n  late Mexican war, Major, then Captain Weightman, at the head of his\r\n  Light Artillery Company, won laurels which placed his name foremost\r\n  among the bravest and most gallant in that war. His fellow soldiers\r\n  still in our midst will cheerfully bear your correspondent\r\n  testimony, that Captain Weightman’s gallantry as a soldier and\r\n  officer was only surpassed by his urbanity and true kindliness of\r\n  feeling as a gentleman; and if the evidence adduced upon his\r\n  preliminary examination before the examining magistrate should\r\n  sustain Weightman’s plan of self-defense in the premises, his former\r\n  friends here and abroad, and his fellow soldiers, will be glad to\r\n  learn that the qualities of heart, for which they used most to prize\r\n  Captain Weightman, in former years, remain untainted even now, when\r\n  his name has become unfortunately coupled with a most grave and\r\n  serious charge. May the public judge, and may not the unquestioned\r\n  enviable renown of Captain Aubrey’s name tend to warp calm judgment\r\n  in pronouncing upon the guilt or innocence of the accused.\r\n\r\n  “The following evidence, being a synopsis of the process verbatim at\r\n  the preliminary examination before Judge Davenport, at Santa Fe,\r\n  have been transmitted to your correspondent from New Mexico by a\r\n  third person, and, as your correspondent has every reason to\r\n  believe, may be fully relied on. It is in the main supported by your\r\n  former notices published in the _Republican_ concerning this same\r\n  transaction.\r\n\r\n  “The circumstances are these: Major Weightman, hearing of the\r\n  arrival of Aubrey, and that he was at the store of the Messrs.\r\n  Mercure, merchants at Santa Fe, crossed the plaza to see him, and\r\n  was one of the first to take him by the hand and greet him as a\r\n  friend. When Major Weightman arrived at the store of the Messrs.\r\n  Mercure, several persons had already arrived to pay their respects\r\n  to Mr. Aubrey.\r\n\r\n  “Aubrey and Weightman met kindly, shook hands, and conversed\r\n  pleasantly for a short time, when something having been said by a\r\n  third person about the route by which Aubrey had arrived from\r\n  California, Aubrey asked the major if he had yet published his paper\r\n  in Albuquerque. The major said, no; that it was dead—had died a\r\n  natural death from want of subscribers. Aubrey then said it should\r\n  have died, because of the lies with which it was filled. This was\r\n  said without excitement. When Weightman asked ‘What lies?’ Aubrey\r\n  remarked: ‘When I returned from California last year you asked me\r\n  for information in respect to my route, and afterwards you abused\r\n  me.’ This Weightman denied, saying, ‘No, Aubrey, I did not abuse\r\n  you.’ Aubrey then said, more or less excited, ‘I say you did, and I\r\n  now repeat, it is a lie,’ at the same time bringing his hand down\r\n  with force upon the counter.\r\n\r\n  “At this Weightman, who was sitting on the counter, five or six feet\r\n  from Aubrey, sprang down and approached Aubrey, who had been\r\n  standing near the counter, and taking a glass from which Aubrey had\r\n  been drinking (a toddy), threw the contents in his face. Weightman\r\n  immediately stepped back, when Aubrey drew a pistol (Colt’s belt\r\n  pistol), the first shot from which took effect in the ceiling\r\n  (supposed to have gone off while cocking). Weightman then drew a\r\n  knife, and before another shot could be fired, closed with Aubrey\r\n  and stabbed him in the abdomen, and soon after seized Aubrey’s\r\n  pistol.\r\n\r\n  “The Messrs. Mercure rushed on and seized the parties. Aubrey\r\n  rapidly sank, and as soon as he relinquished his pistol Weightman\r\n  said: ‘I did it in my own defense, and I will go and surrender\r\n  myself to the authorities,’ which he did, accompanied by his friend,\r\n  Major Cunningham. Aubrey died in a few minutes. He received but the\r\n  one blow. Major Weightman has carried a bowie knife for his own\r\n  protection for a year past, believing it to be necessary for him to\r\n  do so. This was stated as the cause of his being armed. Aubrey was\r\n  of the number of those who were inimical to him. The relations\r\n  between Aubrey and Weightman had been heretofore of the most\r\n  agreeable character.”\r\n\r\nMajor Weightman was a resident of Atchison only a few years. At the\r\noutbreak of the war he joined the southern army, and lost his life in\r\nthe battle of Wilson’s Creek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                    AGRICULTURE AND ITS DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\n  AN AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY—SCIENTIFIC FARMING—FARMERS, THE ARISTOCRACY\r\n      OF THE WEST—MODERN IMPROVEMENT—TOPOGRAPHY—SOIL—STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtchison county is distinctively an agricultural community. There have\r\nbeen some earnest efforts made in the past to develop its mineral\r\nresources, and it is not beyond the realm of possibility that future\r\nefforts in that direction will unlock hidden resources of fabulous\r\nvalue. But in the future, as in the past, agriculture will be the big\r\nimportant dividend producer in this county. Up to this time it is not\r\nunfair to say that only the surface of the soil has been scratched.\r\nFarming has been the occupation of a very large portion of our people\r\nfrom the days when the first settlers took up their claims and with\r\ncrude implements, broke the sod, down to this enlightened age, of the\r\nriding plow and the traction engine, but scientific husbandry has not\r\nbeen followed on a large scale in this county. Crops have been so easy\r\nto produce, on account of rich soil and a favorable climate, that the\r\nmethods employed in countries not so blessed and of a greater\r\npopulation, have not been followed in the past. This is not an\r\narraignment of the former, for Atchison county has been peculiarly\r\nblessed in its possession of an intelligent lot of thrifty farmers. They\r\nhave toiled and labored early and late; they have built comfortable\r\nhomes, accumulated fortunes, and are the sturdy, dependable citizens of\r\nthe county, but for over sixty years they have lacked organization and\r\nthe prosperous farmers have succeeded because of their own personal\r\ninitiative, judgment and hard work. As a class they have not made the\r\nprogress to which they are justly entitled. Those that came early and\r\nremained, have in most instances met with rare success, but they worked\r\nout their own salvation, unaided by scientific organization.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and sixty of them have banded together for mutual help and\r\nhave secured a county agricultural agent to assist them in this\r\ndirection, as the rich country in the States east of us have been forced\r\nto do. The soil also has an abundance of potash and a creditable amount\r\nof phosphorus, so with the proper use of legumes and manure, with the\r\naddition of some phosphorus, the fertility of the soil may be increased\r\nand maintained indefinitely. If soil washing is stopped and the organic\r\nmatter in the soil maintained, this county has a soil, that\r\nagriculturally speaking, is second to none.\r\n\r\nThe real aristocracy in the West, will, in future generations, trace its\r\nancestry back to the pioneers, who settled on the land and tilled it.\r\nThose who went into trade and the professions when they came to Atchison\r\ncounty prior to 1860, and in subsequent years, have prospered, in part,\r\nby their wits, but in the main, on the farmer. The farmers were then, as\r\nnow, the real wealth producers and so it has come to pass, after these\r\nmany years, that the farmer “has arrived,” and with the increase in\r\npopulation and the general trend of advancement and improvement in all\r\nhuman activities, farming now stands near the top of the big human\r\nenterprises. The desire for organization and coöperation among the\r\nfarmers is growing everywhere, and it has taken hold of Atchison county\r\nin recent years.\r\n\r\nThe farmer’s life in this county, in the late fifties and early sixties,\r\nwas a hard and lonely one. During those years many homesteads were\r\npreëmpted, fifteen to twenty-one miles southwest, west and northwest of\r\nAtchison, and onto these the young pioneers took their wives and\r\nfamilies. There they built their log houses, “broke out” their land, and\r\nput it to corn and wheat. There were few neighbors, fewer creature\r\ncomforts, and no conveniences. It was a solitary life.\r\n\r\nThis history contains biographical sketches of many of these pioneers,\r\nand in them will be found the intimate stories of hardships, privations\r\nand discomforts. They came to conquer the resources of nature, and they\r\naccomplished what they came after. There were no highways over which to\r\nconvey their crops when harvested, and the ways to the nearest market\r\nwere long and dreary ones. It was a two days’ trip over the prairies to\r\nAtchison with a load of grain, and there were few ways to economize\r\ntime, although, fortunately, time was not an object then, as it is in\r\nthese restless days.\r\n\r\nAnd yet within the short span of the lives of farmers who are still\r\nhere, there has been a marvelous development. Log houses have given way\r\nto fine commodious homes, steam heated and electric lighted; great barns\r\nshelter the stock, and house the grain; the telephone, the rural\r\ndelivery and the automobile have revolutionized the farmer’s life and\r\nthe farmer’s wife. Better roads are the order of the day, and it will be\r\nalong this line that great progress will be made in the immediate\r\nfuture. Meanwhile, land values are on the increase, and the quarter\r\nsections that sold from $500 to $800 each, fifty years ago, are now\r\nbringing $16,000 to $24,000 each. Within the year 1915 there has been a\r\ngeneral trend of sentiment among the more enterprising farmers to put\r\nfarming upon a more scientific basis. The services of a farm adviser\r\nhave been secured, whose duty it is to assist in this direction. They\r\nare learning more of food values, crop rotation and diversification,\r\nsoil culture and plant life. As the value of these things become more\r\napparent, the farming industry will thrive more, and in another\r\ngeneration the problem of keeping the young men and young women on the\r\nfarm will have been solved.\r\n\r\nThe richest and most valuable farming land in Atchison county is very\r\ngenerally distributed. There are parts of each township that are rough\r\nand broken, but as the population increases land not now regarded as\r\nchoice will be made to produce abundant crops. The river bluffs, which\r\nhave stood so long in timber, are gradually being cleared and the bare\r\nhills which are left, are admirably adapted to fruit, wheat and alfalfa.\r\nMuch of this land is as well adapted to fruit raising as is the already\r\nfamous Wathena district, some of it being exactly the same type of soil.\r\nAll that is needed is that the fruit growers give their plantations\r\ncare. The orchard that is properly cared for produces fruit of a quality\r\nfar superior to that of the famous Northwest. Incidentally, this land\r\nreturns the grower a greater net profit.\r\n\r\nAtchison county lies within the glaciated portion of the plains region.\r\nThe underlying rocks are buried by the glacial till, but in turn is\r\ncovered by a deposit of fine silty material, known as loess. Practically\r\nall the soil throughout this country is derived from the loess covering.\r\nThe principal soil is a brown, almost black, silty loam, well adapted to\r\nthe production of general farm crops. The rainfall is sufficient for the\r\nmaturing of all crops, the normal annual precipitation ranging from\r\nfifteen to twenty-five inches. Atchison county has a population ranging\r\nfrom 28,000 to 30,000 people. There was a slight decrease in the\r\npopulation between the years of 1900 and 1910, yet, in spite of this\r\napparent unfavorable showing, the value of farm land and farm products\r\nhave increased. About ninety-five per cent. of the land in this county\r\nis in farms, of an average value of $69.26 per acre. The proportionate\r\nland area is 263,680 acres, of which 249,339 acres are in farms, with an\r\naggregate land value of $17,270,130, which is more than double what it\r\nwas in 1900, and over two million dollars more than the whole of the\r\nLouisiana Purchase cost us in 1803. Figures and statistics are\r\nproverbially dry and uninteresting, but there is no place in which they\r\ncan be more appropriately used than in history, and no language that can\r\nbe employed could tell a better story of the agricultural progress of\r\nAtchison county, than the statistics taken from the thirteenth census of\r\nthe United States. From this source we find that the total value of\r\nimprovements on the farms in this county in 1910 was $2,692,755, and\r\nthat the value of the implements and machinery used by the farmers, not\r\nincluding automobiles, was $499,129. While the value of domestic animals\r\nand live stock was $2,149,863, and in these figures poultry is not\r\nincluded. The chicken, duck, goose and turkey census reached 150,127,\r\nand these were valued at $77,926. The total value of all crops shown by\r\nthe census of 1910 was as follows:\r\n\r\n                  Cereals               $1,928,065.00\r\n                  Other grain and seeds      3,577.00\r\n                  Hay and forage           281,793.00\r\n                  Vegetables                94,232.00\r\n                  Fruits and nuts           32,297.00\r\n                  All other crops           30,883.00\r\n                                        —————————————\r\n                       Grand Total      $2,370,847.00\r\n\r\nMaking a grand total of $2,370,847.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n                               THE PRESS.\r\n\r\n  INFLUENCE OF NEWSPAPERS—PART PLAYED BY THE EARLY PRESS—“SQUATTER\r\n      SOVEREIGN”—“FREEDOM’S CHAMPION”—“CHAMPION AND PRESS”—PIONEER\r\n      EDITORS—LATER NEWSPAPERS AND NEWSPAPER MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the mighty powers for good and evil, none can excel the\r\nnewspaper. Take all the newspapers out of the world today and there\r\nwould be chaos. Mankind would lie groping in the dark, and life itself\r\nwould be a vain and empty thing. Newspapers are the arteries through\r\nwhich the lifeblood of the world runs. They carry to our firesides the\r\ncontinued story of civilization.\r\n\r\nEarly in the history of Atchison county, before the schools and the\r\nchurches, the newspaper appeared. It received a bounty of the original\r\ntown company when that association, September 21, 1854, by a resolution,\r\ndonated $400 to Robert Kelley and Dr. J. H. Stringfellow, to start a\r\nprinting office, and it was then that the _Squatter Sovereign_ was\r\nconceived, and after a brief period of gestation, was born February 3,\r\n1855. By a strange stroke of misfortune this first newspaper in the\r\ncounty stood for a wrong principle and preached bad doctrine, for it\r\nadvocated human slavery. Yet it was a creature of environment, and\r\nreflected the prevailing sentiment of its constituency. It was fearless\r\nin its attitude and rabid in its utterances. It was a violent organ of\r\nhate and bitterness toward all Free State men, and in it appeared a\r\nconstant flood of inflammatory comment directed against those who\r\nopposed slavery, and were determined that Kansas should be the land of\r\nthe brave and the home of the free. But as the pro-slavery cause waned,\r\nthe _Squatter Sovereign_ waned with it, and in the fall of 1857, when\r\nsaner counsel and the feeling of brotherhood grew, the town company\r\ndisposed of its interest in the _Squatter Sovereign_ to the New England\r\nAid Society, of which S. C. Pomeroy was agent, and the paper then passed\r\ninto the hands of Robert McBratney and Franklin G. Adams. Mr. Adams and\r\nMr. McBratney were both Free Soilers, but they did not run the paper\r\nlong. It was shortly sold to O. F. Short, who ran it until the following\r\nFebruary, and on the twentieth day of that month, 1858. John A. Martin\r\npurchased the plant and changed the name of the paper to _Freedom’s\r\nChampion_. Under that name Colonel Martin made of his paper one of the\r\nleading Free State organs of the Territory. Always a brilliant editor,\r\nof courage and deep convictions, Colonel Martin during his whole career\r\nnever performed a greater service than during the time he shouted the\r\nbattle-cry of freedom through the columns of _Freedom’s Champion_, from\r\n1858 to 1861. In September of the latter year, he laid aside his pen and\r\ntook up his sword in defense of the principles he so stoutly advocated,\r\nand thus translated his words into deeds. When he went to the front he\r\nleft the _Champion_ in charge of George J. Stebbins, who continued in\r\ncharge until the fall of 1863, when it was leased to John J. Ingalls and\r\nRobert H. Horton. These two men afterwards became political rivals. Both\r\nwere lawyers and both residents of Atchison for many years. Horton was a\r\ntypical lawyer, smooth and tactful, who enjoyed a successful career in\r\nthe practice of his profession and on the bench. Ingalls was of a\r\ndifferent temperament, being more intellectual, caring little for the\r\nlaw, less tactful, but ambitious. They both met in the arena of\r\npolitics, and Horton was the vanquished. Following the senatorial\r\nelection of 1879, at which they were both candidates, they became bitter\r\nenemies, and did not speak until they met, by chance, in London, in\r\n1891. While these two men were editors of the _Champion_. Ingalls did\r\nmost of the writing and kept things warm until the return of Colonel\r\nMartin from the war in January, 1865, one of the Nation’s heroes. Three\r\nmonths after his return, on the twenty-second day of March, 1865.\r\nColonel Martin became the publisher of a daily paper, and on August 11,\r\n1868, the _Freedom’s Champion_ was consolidated with the _Atchison Free\r\nPress_, under the name of _Champion and Press_. The _Free Press_ was a\r\nRepublican daily paper, and first appeared May 5, 1864, with Franklin G.\r\nAdams as its editor and proprietor. In April, 1865, Frank A. Root became\r\na partner, and subsequently, L. R. Elliott, who had been an assistant\r\neditor, became a proprietor, with Mr. Root retiring later, when the\r\npaper was consolidated with the _Champion_.\r\n\r\nThe office of the _Champion and Press_ was destroyed by fire May 20,\r\n1869, but three weeks later the paper was in running order, with John A.\r\nMartin as sole editor and proprietor, and from that date until the death\r\nof Mr. Martin October 2, 1889, it remained one of the most influential\r\nand prosperous papers in the State of Kansas.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Mr. Martin, the newspaper property was turned over to\r\nhis father-in-law, W. L. Challiss, as executor of Mr. Martin’s estate,\r\nand on the day of Mr. Martin’s death the name of Phillip Krohn appears\r\nas managing editor. Krohn occupied that important place until March 29,\r\n1890, when his name appeared for the last time as editor. Dr. Phillip\r\nKrohn was a man of brilliant attainments, a fluent writer, and a\r\npleasing public speaker. He was a Methodist minister by profession, but,\r\nalthough he occupied the pulpit upon occasions, his name was seldom\r\ntaken seriously in connection with religious work. From the date of\r\nGovernor Martin’s death the paper gradually waned in influence. The\r\npaper remained the property of the estate of Governor Martin, and Luther\r\nC. Challiss was editor and manager, until October 11, 1804, when A. J.\r\nFelt, an ex-lieutenant governor of Kansas, became its editor and\r\nproprietor. The paper did not prosper under the management of Mr. Felt,\r\nand four years later a company was organized by Charles M. Sheldon, a\r\npromoter, and Mr. Sheldon became its editor May 2, 1898. Mr. Sheldon was\r\nan enthusiastic and aggressive individual, who had very little respect\r\nfor the value of money, which he spent so lavishly that two months\r\nlater, July 1, 1898, his name appeared for the last time as editor of\r\nthe _Champion_. On the twentieth of that month the paper was sold to\r\nsatisfy a mortgage and the property was re-purchased by A. J. Felt, who\r\nimmediately transferred it to the Champion Linotype Printing Company, a\r\npartnership, composed of Edward Skinner, George T. Housen, Charles O.\r\nHovatter, James McNamara and A. J. Felt. Mr. Felt again resumed the\r\neditorial management of the paper, and remained in charge until January\r\n1, 1899.\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 1899, Henry Kuhn, who surveyed the townsite of Atchison,\r\nreturned to the city with his son, James G. Kuhn. They made a heroic\r\neffort to restore the lost prestige of the _Champion_, but soon became\r\ndiscouraged, and in the latter part of May or early in the June\r\nfollowing, they gave up the ghost and silently disappeared. The\r\nmortgagees continued the publication of the paper, and July 31, 1899,\r\nthe name of John A. Reynolds appears as business manager. It had no\r\neditor until August 23, 1899, when James G. Day, Jr., a young lawyer,\r\noccupying a desk in the office of Waggener, Horton & Orr, became editor\r\nand manager. Mr. Day ran a daily until January 9, 1900, when it was\r\ndiscontinued. The following March he published a daily for one week, “as\r\nthe devil would run it,” a piece of cynicism in reply to an effort the\r\n_Topeka Capital_ made a short time before, when that paper was turned\r\nover to Rev. Charles M. Sheldon, the eminent Congregational preacher,\r\nwho ran that paper one week, “As Jesus would run it.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the _Champion_ had its ups and downs, but did not die. A\r\ndaily again appeared April 22, 1901, with Ewing Herbert, one of the\r\ncelebrated newspaper men of Kansas, as its editor and owner. Mr. Herbert\r\nwas at that time the owner of the _Brown County World_, at Hiawatha. He\r\nconceived the idea that Atchison offered an attractive field for a\r\nnewspaper venture, and he succeeded in interesting some local capital in\r\nhis enterprise. Capt. John Seaton was a stockholder, among others, and\r\nJay House, the present mayor of Topeka (1915) and a brilliant newspaper\r\nparagrapher, was city editor. Mr. Herbert spent only part of his time in\r\nAtchison, and turned over the management of the _Champion_ to Mr. House.\r\nIt looked for a time as if Mr. Herbert was going to make a success of\r\nhis venture, but just at the height of his prosperity he was guilty of\r\nan editorial indiscretion, which turned some powerful influences against\r\nthe paper, and on August 17, 1901, Mr. Herbert gave up his effort as a\r\nbad job and turned the plant over to one W. A. Robinson, formerly of St.\r\nLouis, Mo. Mr. Robinson was a follower of Henry George, the great single\r\ntaxer, and conceived it to be his duty to spread the single tax\r\npropaganda through the editorial columns of the _Champion_. His efforts\r\nin this direction did not prove profitable, and becoming disheartened\r\nand discouraged he fled from the city shortly thereafter, a much poorer\r\nbut wiser man.\r\n\r\nThe _Champion_ next fell into the hands of Corman H. Young, for many\r\nyears a successful music merchant, of Atchison, who incidentally\r\nacquired a small job printing plant, which he operated on North Fifth\r\nstreet, and which he subsequently merged with the _Champion_ plant,\r\nhaving acquired that by paying off the mortgage which Mr. Robinson gave\r\nEwing Herbert at the lime he undertook to acquire the property. Mr.\r\nYoung ran a weekly paper for a number of years, until May, 1907, when he\r\nemployed Walt Mason, the famous prose poet of the United States, to\r\nassume the editorial management of a daily. Mr. Mason many years before\r\nhad been a resident of Atchison, and ran the Globe during the absence of\r\nMr. Howe in Europe. He was not so famous in 1907 as he is in 1915, but\r\nhe was just as brilliant. He published the daily _Champion_ on pink\r\npaper and filled it with columns of editorial matter and humorous\r\nrunning comment on current affairs. Mr. Mason had a wonderful capacity\r\nfor work and could prepare more “copy” in one day than all the other\r\nwriters on the paper could prepare in a week. During the summer of 1907,\r\nSheffield Ingalls, having returned from the legislature, where he was a\r\nmember of the house of representatives, became an editorial writer on\r\nthe _Champion_. November 20, 1907, Mr. Young prevailed upon Mr. Ingalls\r\nto give up his other work and become editor of the paper. As Mr. Ingalls\r\nwalked into the office, Mr. Mason walked out, never to return. Mr.\r\nIngalls remained editor and manager of the _Champion_ until October 6,\r\n1909, having been frustrated in plans he had made to acquire the\r\nproperty as his own. Mr. Young continued to run the paper until July 1,\r\n1911, when Mr. Ingalls, with the assistance of J. C. Killarney,\r\nsucceeded in organizing a company, which purchased the paper and turned\r\nit over to Eugene C. Pulliam, as editor. Mr. Pulliam was a young man,\r\nwho had served his apprenticeship on the _Kansas City Star_ as a\r\nreporter. He was a good writer, but lacked experience and business\r\njudgment, and while he made a vigorous effort to run the paper, and had\r\nthe benefit of strong financial connections, he did not succeed, and\r\nSeptember 1, 1914, he turned the paper over to Sheffield Ingalls as\r\ntrustee, and it was subsequently sold to A. S. Andereck and his brother,\r\nA. P. Andereck, of Kankakee, Ill. A few months later a company was\r\norganized, composed of the Andereck brothers, O. A. Simmons, vice-\r\npresident of the First National Bank, Wilbur C. Hawk and Sheffield\r\nIngalls, who in 1915 are conducting the paper, and it is enjoying its\r\nmost prosperous days since the death of its brilliant editor, John A.\r\nMartin.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 there came to Atchison a young man who subsequently became one\r\nof the famous editors of the United States, Edgar Watson Howe. Mr. Howe\r\nwas born in Wabash county, Indiana, May 3, 1854, a son of Henry and\r\nElizabeth Howe. When he was about three years of age his family removed\r\nto Bethany, Harrison county, Missouri, where the father, a Methodist\r\npreacher, published a newspaper of strong abolition sentiments. The\r\nyounger Mr. Howe served an apprenticeship at the printer’s trade in his\r\nfather’s office, and in 1868 started out for himself. He visited various\r\ncities, working at the case to earn money to pay his way from one place\r\nto another, and at the age of eighteen became the publisher of the\r\nweekly _Globe_, at Golden, Colo. From there he went to Falls City, Neb.,\r\nwhere he published a newspaper, subsequently coming to Atchison, and\r\nestablished the _Daily Globe_. When Mr. Howe reached Atchison, the\r\n_Champion_, under the management of John A. Martin, was the most\r\npowerful newspaper organ in the northern half of Kansas, and the field\r\nhere was none too promising on this account. However, Mr. Howe proceeded\r\nto publish a paper of an entirely different type than that published by\r\nMr. Martin. It was a small sheet, and was devoted to “_gab, gossip and\r\npaid locals_,” and for over thirty years this policy was successfully\r\nmaintained by Mr. Howe. It was unique in the journalistic world, and\r\nunder the management of Mr. Howe it acquired a National reputation,\r\nchiefly because of the quaint, homely philosophy it contained and the\r\nunusual treatment he gave the ordinary incidents of human life. As a\r\nreporter of this class of news, Mr. Howe was perhaps without a peer in\r\nthe country. For over thirty years he tramped the streets of Atchison\r\nwith note-book and pencil, and to practically every item he turned in he\r\ngave a peculiar twist, which reflected a remarkable insight of human\r\nnature. With Mr. Howe were associated Miss Frances L. Garside, Ralph\r\n(“Doc”) Tennal, Miss Nellie Webb and J. E. Rank. To each of them Mr.\r\nHowe was indebted for much of the success the _Globe_ attained. The\r\ndeath of Col. John A. Martin and the collapse of the _Champion_, that\r\nfollowed, gave Mr. Howe his opportunity, and for the greater part of his\r\nactive newspaper career in Atchison he had the field to himself. The\r\n_Globe_ was a great financial success and in one year it has been said\r\nthat Mr. Howe cleared close to $24,000 on his property. “Doc” Tennal was\r\nthe first one of Mr. Howe’s faithful associates to break up the _Globe_\r\nfamily. Mr. Tennal was a remarkable reporter of local news, but being\r\nambitious and realizing the limitations by which he was surrounded, he\r\nconcluded to acquire a newspaper property of his own, and in pursuance\r\nof that plan, he bought the _Sabetha Herald_ in 1905, subsequently\r\nrelinquishing it to become editor of the _Kansas City Weekly Star_. He\r\nreturned some years later to Sabetha, and re-purchased the _Herald_\r\nplant, and is now the editor of that prosperous and progressive paper\r\n(1915).\r\n\r\nJ. E. Rank left the _Globe_ a few years later, and went to Bartlesville,\r\nOkla., where he ran a paper a short time, and then returned to Atchison,\r\nand his first newspaper love.\r\n\r\nMiss Garside, who was one of the most brilliant newspaper women in the\r\ncountry, went from the _Globe_ to the _New York Journal_, and in 1909\r\nMr. Howe turned the _Globe_ over to his son, Eugene Howe, who is now\r\n(1915) its editor and principal owner. Associated with him are Mr. Rank\r\nand Miss Nellie Webb, together with other old _Globe_ employes.\r\n\r\nMiss Webb is the society reporter, and in this capacity she has acquired\r\na brilliant reputation among the newspaper women of Kansas. The “policy”\r\nof the _Globe_ remains unchanged, and, while it may not enjoy the same\r\nprestige it had during the days of the elder Howe, it is still one of\r\nthe moneymaking newspaper plants of Kansas. Eugene Howe is a young man\r\nof much promise. He is still young and has spent his life in newspaper\r\nwork. He has carried the new responsibilities thrust upon him by his\r\nfather both gracefully and tactfully, and there is every reason to\r\npredict a successful future for him.\r\n\r\nAmong the early newspaper enterprises of Atchison was _The Patriot_,\r\nestablished by Nelson Abbott October 25, 1867. In September, 1868,\r\nMessrs. H. Clay Park, B. P. Waggener and Mr. Abbott formed a\r\npartnership, under the name of H. Clay Park & Company, and purchased the\r\nestablishment, and in October of the same year, the paper passed into\r\nthe hands of C. F. and C. P. Cochrane, but shortly thereafter reverted\r\nto Nelson Abbott, who remained in control until December, 1875. Dr. H.\r\nB. Horn, for many years a respected and honored citizen of Atchison, was\r\nconnected with the paper as bookkeeper and business manager, and\r\nperformed much of the editorial work, and when Mr. Abbott finally\r\nrelinquished control of the paper, it fell again into the hands of H.\r\nClay Park, who together with F. L. Vandergrift and P. H. Peters, assumed\r\ncontrol. Mr. Peters did not remain long in the partnership, and in 1877\r\nhe sold his interest to E. W. Beall. The paper was Democratic, and Mr.\r\nPark, who was very actively identified with the affairs of Atchison in\r\nthe early days, was an able editor. He left Atchison twenty-five years\r\nlater, to become an editorial writer on the _St. Joseph News_ and\r\n_Press_. F. L. Vandergrift is one of the famous newspaper men of Kansas,\r\nand for many years was the representative in Kansas of the _Kansas City\r\nStar_. He is one of the best loved and best known newspaper writers of\r\nthe West, and is now (1915) editor of the _Earth_, a publication devoted\r\nto the interests of the Santa Fe railroad.\r\n\r\nOne of the well known newspaper men of the West connected with _The\r\nPatriot_ was Tom Stivers, who was connected with the _Champion_ for\r\neight years, and in January, 1879, became a partner with Mr. Park and\r\nMr. Vandergrift.\r\n\r\n_The Patriot_ was an afternoon daily paper, and always stanchly\r\nDemocratic in politics, and for many years was a successful journalistic\r\nenterprise. This paper continued to be published either as a weekly or a\r\ndaily until about October 12, 1895. It was in a precarious condition\r\nmany years before that date, and had a number of different editors,\r\namong them F. M. Stambaugh and W. J. Montgomery. _The Atchison Morning\r\nStar_ and _Daily Patriot_ was built upon the wreck of the original\r\n_Patriot_, its first issue being dated October 13, 1895, and running\r\nuntil February 23, 1896.\r\n\r\n_The Atchison Union_ was a Democratic paper, established by Gideon O.\r\nChase, about 1858. It had an office in a frame building at the southwest\r\ncorner of Fifth and Commercial streets, subsequently occupied by the\r\n_Champion_. Mr. Chase came from Waverly. N. V., and his paper, while\r\nDemocratic, was for the Union and against slavery. Mr. Chase did not\r\nremain in charge of the paper very long, and turned it over to W. H.\r\nAddoms and G. I. Stebbins. Shortly thereafter Stebbins retired, and\r\nAddoms went to Leavenworth, where he started a paper, turning his\r\ninterest over to A. P. Cochrane, who was an employe in the office.\r\nCochrane did not run the paper but a short time, when a Mr. Leland,\r\nFrancis J. Marion and Franklin G. Adams assumed control and ran it a\r\nshort time, when Marion took the plant of Plattsburg, Mo., and junked\r\nit, and for many years what was left of the paper was piled up in the\r\ncourt house at that place.\r\n\r\n_The Atchison Church Visitor_ was established in 1906, and was published\r\nby the pastors of the following churches: English Lutheran, Methodist,\r\nChristian, Congregational, Presbyterian, Baptist.\r\n\r\nOn January 14, 1911, Paul Tonsing became its editor and publisher. The\r\npaper is printed by Mr. Tonsing in the office over 500 Commercial\r\nstreet, so long occupied as the editorial room of John A. Martin, of\r\nwhom Mr. Tonsing is a son-in-law. Mr. Tonsing is a Lutheran minister by\r\nprofession, and for a number of years after his graduation from Midland\r\nCollege, he did pastoral work in a number of Lutheran churches in\r\nNebraska and Kansas. Mr. Tonsing is a reformer, and a man not without\r\ncourage and ability. His views are looked upon as too extreme by the\r\nconservative liberal element of Atchison, but all give him credit for\r\nbeing conscientious and honest. He is a hard-working, industrious\r\ncitizen, and, while he has made inane active enemies in his reform work,\r\nhe enjoys the personal satisfaction of seeing many of the reforms he has\r\nadvocated come to pass. He is an avowed foe of the liquor traffic, and\r\nhas perhaps done more than any other individual in the community to make\r\nhis views on that question effective. In connection with the publication\r\nof the _Church Visitor_, Mr. Tonsing also prints and edits the _Western\r\nChief_, a monthly publication devoted to the Improved Order of Redmen.\r\n\r\n_E. W. Howe’s Monthly_ was started by Mr. Howe in March, 1911. It is\r\npublished monthly and contains practically all of the present literary\r\nefforts of its editor. Mr. Howe has adopted the use of pink paper for\r\nthis publication, which is composed of four pages. It contains no\r\nadvertising matter, but has a large circulation among friends and\r\nadmirers of Mr. Howe’s peculiar literary type. Mr. Howe has popularized\r\nthis monthly by making the price so low that no subscriber can afford\r\nnot to take it, and when he has reached a circulation large enough, he\r\nplans to put it on a profitable basis as an advertising medium.\r\n\r\n_The Effingham New Leaf_ was started about April 12, 1894, with M. C.\r\nKlingman, editor, and his wife, Mrs. Ima L. Klingman, as associate\r\neditor. The _New Leaf_ was the successor of the _Effingham Times_,\r\nfounded in 1887, and the _Effingham Graphic_, founded in 1891, and the\r\n_Effingham World_, founded in 1893. After the death of M. C. Klingman,\r\nat the Missouri Baptist sanitarium, at St. Louis, Mo., May 5, 1899, Mrs.\r\nKlingman took charge as editor and publisher, and employed W. W. Cahoon,\r\nassociate editor. January 4, 1901, J. W. Coleman became the editor and\r\npublisher, and W. W. Cahoon, associate editor. In December, 1903, W. W.\r\nCahoon purchased a one-half interest and the firm became Coleman &\r\nCahoon. Mr. Coleman re-purchased the paper October 16, 1903, and\r\ncontinued its publication until September 8, 1903, when Mr. Cahoon and\r\nC. E. Sells became the editors and publishers. May 4 of the following\r\nyear Mr. Cahoon sold his interest to W. H. Sells, and August 31, 1906,\r\nC. E. and A. J. Sells took charge of the paper, and in 1915 were still\r\nits publishers.\r\n\r\n_The Effingham New Leaf_ is a successful country newspaper, serving its\r\nreaders faithfully and satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n_The Muscotah Record_ was founded about October 1, 1884, by F. M.\r\nBonham, who ran the paper until about 1886, when on August 18 of that\r\nyear the Miller brothers became its editors and publishers. They sold it\r\nto Claud Martin and Coleman Martin December 4, 1889, who subsequently\r\nsold the plan to M. C. Klingman, editor of the _Effingham New Leaf_,\r\nMay, 1890. Mr. Klingman turned the property over to Fred W. Badger July\r\n18, 1890, who continued the paper until December 8, 1893, when he\r\ndisposed of it to John Ford. Ford published the paper until November 1,\r\n1894, when he sold it to James S. Martin and Guy L. Stotter, the latter\r\nassuming entire control March 6, 1896. Mr. Stotter sold the _Record_ to\r\nJ. W. Campbell August 17, 1905, but assumed control of it again November\r\n23, 1905, and remained in control until June 6, 1907, when J. A.\r\nShoemaker, who afterwards became county superintendent of Atchison\r\ncounty, appeared as its editor and publisher. When Mr. Shoemaker was\r\nelected county superintendent, he turned the property over to A. W.\r\nHuntis, who on February 3, 1910, sold it to P. J. Cortelyon, and March\r\n7, 1912, the property was purchased by R. M. Dunlap, who is now (1915)\r\nits editor and publisher.\r\n\r\n_The Huron Herald_ started January 7, 1892, with Frank I. White as\r\neditor and publisher. On May 16, 1895, Messrs. Priest & Priest took\r\ncharge and were in control October 18, 1896, when the office was\r\ndestroyed by fire. The paper was suspended for a few weeks and the next\r\nissue was dated November 6, 1896, with W. E. Johnson, editor and\r\npublisher. _The Herald_ suspended publication in February, 1897, and was\r\nagain resurrected by W. A. Huff by the issue of April 9, 1897. Mr. Huff\r\ndiscontinued the paper in 1900, and went to Brown county, where he was\r\nactive in newspaper work in that county. _The Huron Herald_ was revived\r\nagain April 12, 1907, by J. E. Smith, who published it until March 12,\r\n1914, and March 19 of that year. J. M. Delaney announced that through no\r\nfault of his, he was forced to take control of the paper, and had\r\nemployed Herman Van. On August 19, 1915, T. A. Cur became editor, and on\r\nNovember 11, 1915, Orvil L. Pancake was in charge.\r\n\r\n_The Potter Kansan_ was originally known as the _Potter Leaf_, which\r\nstarted November 22, 1900, by Eppie L. Barber and Norene Barber, his\r\nwife. Mr. Barber surrendered control of the paper September 17, 1903,\r\nturning it over to his wife, who became its publisher. Shortly\r\nthereafter, Charles B. Remsburg, who for many years was a well known\r\nnewspaper reporter in northeastern Kansas, appeared as its editor and\r\npublisher, and remained in charge until May 11, 1905, when he turned it\r\nover to J. W. Thompson and his wife, Mrs. J. W. Thompson. On August 17,\r\n1905, the Thompsons leased the paper to R. J. Wilson, but in the\r\nfollowing December Mr. Thompson resumed control again and placed Howard\r\nC. King in charge as local editor and business manager. On March 22,\r\n1906, W. A. Remsburg became proprietor and in the following September,\r\nJ. E. Remsburg purchased the plant, and is now its editor.\r\n\r\n_The Potter Kansan_ is one of the best known country weekly papers in\r\nKansas and the contributions from the pen of George J. Remsburg, the\r\nnoted archaeologist and newspaper paragrapher and poet, are frequently\r\nquoted by the newspapers of the State.\r\n\r\nAtchison county, perhaps, has been the graveyard for as many newspapers\r\nas any other county in the State. The State Historical Society has\r\nreserved the record, and in many instances, the files, of newspapers,\r\nwhich have been born, and after a brief existence, have died in this\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThe first rival newspaper of the _Champion_, then the _Squatter\r\nSovereign_, was the _Sumner Gazette_, published at Sumner in 1857. It\r\nsurvived only a short time, as also did the _Western Spy_, which lived a\r\nfew months in 1860.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 _The Kansas Zeitung_ was started by Kab & Sussman, but was moved\r\nto Leavenworth in 1859.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen papers sprung up in 1862 and 1863, among which were: _The\r\nPleifer_, _The Bulletin_, _The Union-Banner_, _The Anti-Jayhawker_, _The\r\nStandard_, and _Die Tackle_.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the anti John A. Martin crowd, headed by John M. Price, started\r\na Republican daily and weekly, called the _Globe_, with A. W. Wagnhals,\r\nJ. B. Dutton, Rev. E. Cooper, T. F. Smith and Franklin G. Adams as the\r\nprincipal writers. It lasted but a few months. Wagnhals subsequently\r\nchanged his name to Wagnalls, and moved to New York City, where he\r\nbecame a great publisher as a member of the firm of Funk & Wagnalls,\r\nwhich published the Standard Dictionary and a number of other well known\r\npublications.\r\n\r\nThe following list shows the different publications received by the\r\nHistorical Society from Atchison county at the end of the year 1915:\r\n\r\n _Atchison Champion_, daily and weekly.\r\n _Atchison Globe_, daily and weekly.\r\n _The Midland_, Atchison.\r\n _The Abbey Student_, Atchison.\r\n _Midland College Bulletin_, Atchison.\r\n _St. Benedict’s Calendar_, Atchison.\r\n _The Western Chief_, Atchison.\r\n _Atchison Church Visitor._\r\n _E. W. Howe’s Monthly_, Atchison.\r\n _Kansas Synod Lutheran_, Atchison.\r\n _The Optimist_, Atchison.\r\n _Effingham New Leaf._\r\n _Atchison County High School News_, Effingham.\r\n _Muscotah Record._\r\n _Potter Kansan._\r\n _Huron Herald._\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous publications that have enjoyed a brief existence in\r\nthis county, are the following:\r\n\r\n_Kansas Churchman_, published at Atchison from November, 1891, to\r\nDecember, 1892. Rev. E. K. Brooke was editor. This publication had been\r\npublished at Salina, Kan., previously, and from Atchison was removed to\r\nLawrence.\r\n\r\n_Arrington Argus_, started by T. W. Gardner, and was suspended after the\r\ntenth number.\r\n\r\n_The American Journal of Education_ was published at Atchison and St.\r\nLouis, Mo., by Messrs. J. B. Merwin and I. C. Scott, in 1870.\r\n\r\n_The Atchisonian_, established March 24, 1877, by the Atchison\r\nPublishing Company. This paper was a six column, eight page affair, with\r\na patent inside. The last issue appeared May 26, 1877.\r\n\r\n_Atchison Daily Times_ was started February 3, 1887, by John N.\r\nReynolds, but after the seventh issue the paper was changed to a weekly,\r\nand called the _Atchison Weekly Times_, from March 19 to July 2, 1887.\r\nThe next issue was dated July 11, 1887, and was again called _The\r\nAtchison Daily Times_, and ran as such until August 6, 1887, when it\r\nsuspended. John N. Reynolds was in many ways, a unique character. He\r\ncame to Atchison as the organizer and manager of a live stock insurance\r\ncompany. He was at one time a preacher, and his career in Atchison was\r\nremarkable for its violence and his disregard for both the proprieties\r\nand the ethics of the newspaper profession, he was looked upon by many\r\nas an irresponsible demagogue, and it was supposed that he ran his paper\r\nfor blackmailing purposes. The story goes that during his management of\r\nthe live stock insurance company, he incurred an advertising bill with\r\none of the local papers, and failing to pay the bill, the editor of the\r\nlocal paper, instead of having recourse to the courts, began to heap\r\nabuse upon Reynolds, and using this as a pretext, Reynolds established\r\nthe _Times_, for the purpose of retaliation. As the result of this\r\nepisode, Reynolds became very violent in his denunciation of many men of\r\nestablished reputations in the community, and during the time that he\r\npublished his paper there was much excitement of an undesirable\r\ncharacter in the city. Reynolds finally landed in the Kansas State\r\npenitentiary, having served a term previously in the Missouri State\r\npenitentiary. He wrote a book subsequently, relating largely to his\r\ntreatment in these two institutions, which he entitled “The Twin Hells.”\r\nFor a short period he edited his paper from the county jail in Atchison,\r\nbut in 1888 J. A. Sunderland took hold of the _Times_, and it was\r\npublished up to January 31, 1891.\r\n\r\n_The Sunday Morning Call_ was started by the Call Printing Company, with\r\nFrank Pearce as editor and publisher, and was first issued in magazine\r\nform February 8, 1880. March 28, 1880, Barton Lowe & Company became\r\neditors and publishers, enlarging the paper to a five column folio.\r\nJanuary 3, 1881, Luther L. Higby appears as a member of the firm, but\r\nwith the issue of October 9, 1881, Luther L. Higby became sole owner.\r\nNovember 6, 1881, C. F. Cochrane became one of the editors, and January\r\n18, 1882, Chris Rutt became a partner of Mr. Higby, and this firm sold\r\nthe plant to Herman J. Rodman October 22, 1882, who continued it until\r\nNovember 18, 1883, when the name was changed to _The Western Mercury_,\r\nwith E. J. Van Deventer and H. J. Rodman as publishers, and it was\r\ncontinued until about 1886.\r\n\r\n_The Missouri Valley Farmer_ was published by A. J. Felt during the time\r\nthat Mr. Felt was editor of the _Champion_. The first issue of the\r\n_Farmer_ was dated January 5, 1893, and it continued until August 18,\r\n1898, at which time it was sold to C. M. Sheldon, who also became owner\r\nof the _Champion_, and the _Missouri Valley Farmer_ was moved to Kansas\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n_The New West_ was a monthly journal of immigration, published by the\r\nImmigrant Union, that was established in Atchison in August, 1878. It\r\nwas issued in magazine form and contained about sixteen pages of reading\r\nmatter. The earlier numbers of the publication were printed at Hannibal,\r\nMo., and in 1878 H. H. Allen, who was for many years a real estate\r\noperator in Atchison, became the editor of this paper. Mr. Allen\r\nsubsequently sold the property to J. G. P. Hilderbrand, who later turned\r\nthe property over to two men by the names of Berry and Henry. The last\r\nissue appeared about July, 1880.\r\n\r\n_Atchison Baptist_ was a monthly magazine, printed by the City Mission\r\nPublication Company, of Pittsburgh, Pa., in the interests of the First\r\nBaptist church, of Atchison. It lasted about three years, and W. H. Park\r\nwas the local editor.\r\n\r\n_Kansas Agriculturist_ was a weekly publication, which was established\r\nJuly 18, 1898, and probably died about March 20, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe _Atchison Blade_ was established July 16, 1892, and published by the\r\nBlade Publishing Company, composed of Dr. Grant Brown, Natt G. Langston,\r\nand Will Harris, three prominent negroes of Atchison. It was a four\r\npage, six column paper, and was operated, after several changes in the\r\nmanagement, until about January 20, 1894. It again resumed publication\r\nNovember 5, 1897, and was run until September 19, 1898, by H. Lewis\r\nDorsey.\r\n\r\n_The Kansas Statesman_, Atchison, was established February 15, 1901, by\r\nG. W. Myers & Sons, office, 315 Commercial street.

Tompkins, and James W. Reilly. This paper was the official\r\npaper of the Kansas State Assembly of the Knights of Labor, office, 521\r\nCommercial street. The last issue on file is dated November 6, 1886, and\r\nthe paper moved to Topeka after this date.\r\n\r\n_The Atchison Banner_ was a German paper, and C. F. Ruth was editor and\r\npublisher. This was a seven column, four page paper, and was founded\r\nMarch 1, 1878. It was enlarged to an eight column paper the same year.\r\nIt supported the Republican State ticket in 1878. The paper was\r\nsuspended after the issue of July 12, 1879.\r\n\r\n_The Bible Investigator_ was a monthly publication, started about July,\r\n1881, by William Kirby and A. D. Stevens.

Upon the passage of this act, the first bank authorized to do\r\nbusiness under it was The Kansas Valley Bank, of Leavenworth, with an\r\nauthorized capital stock of $800,000.00, with five branches, at\r\nAtchison, LeCompton, Doniphan, Ft. Scott and Shawnee. The authorized\r\ncapital stock of each one of the branches was $300,000.00, and under the\r\nterms of the act, each branch was independent of the Leavenworth\r\ninstitution. The great Government Overland Transportation Company of\r\nMajors Smoot-Russell & Company was the big financial power behind this\r\norganization. The Leavenworth bank was never formed, and the Atchison\r\nbranch was the first to start out under this act of the legislature,\r\nbeing authorized to begin business February 19, 1857, with securities\r\namounting to $100,000. Dr. John H. Stringfellow, Joseph Plean and Samuel\r\nDickson were authorized to open subscription books. The board of\r\ndirectors included Samuel C. Pomeroy, who was president: W. H. Russell,\r\nL. R. Smoot, W. B. Waddell, Franklin G. Adams, Samuel Dickson and W. E.\r\nGaylord. Shortly after the bank began business there were rumors\r\nemanating from the rival towns of Sumner and Doniphan that the Atchison\r\ninstitution was about to suspend, and for the purpose of allaying any\r\nsuspicion on the part of the public, created by these rumors, the\r\ndirectors published a statement of its condition, showing that the\r\nassets were $36,638.00, with liabilities of $20,118.00. In July or\r\nAugust, 1857, L. S. Boling, of LeCompton, was appointed to examine and\r\nreport on the financial condition of the Atchison branch of the Kansas\r\nValley Bank, and this is the first record in Kansas of a proceeding of\r\nthis kind.\r\n\r\nSamuel C. Pomeroy resigned as president of the bank in 1858, and was\r\nsucceeded by William H. Russell, of the contracting firm of Majors-\r\nSmoot-Russell & Company. G. H. Fairchild was made vice-president, and R.\r\nL. Pease, cashier.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, this bank, then called the Kansas Valley Bank, had its name\r\nchanged by act of the legislature, to the Bank of the State of Kansas,\r\nand it was conducted under that name until 1866, when the stockholders\r\nwound up its affairs.\r\n\r\nThe legitimate successor of the Bank of the State of Kansas was\r\nHetherington’s Exchange Bank, which was founded in 1859 by William\r\nHetherington.\r\n\r\nThe Exchange National Bank, of Atchison, Kan., is the oldest banking\r\ninstitution in the city of Atchison, having been established in 1859,\r\nwhile Kansas was a Territory. The bank was then named the Hetherington\r\nExchange Bank. That bank became the successor of the Bank of the State\r\nof Kansas, which was organized in 1857. The founder of the Hetherington\r\nExchange Bank was William Hetherington, and, except for one year during\r\nthe Civil war, it has been in successful operation since it was\r\nestablished. It passed through the period of its existence during\r\nTerritorial days, and the depressing financial conditions as a result of\r\nthe war, and business reversals incident to the reconstruction period,\r\nand its management was at all times conducted upon the theory of its\r\nmotto adopted by William Hetherington in an early day that “Safety\r\nFirst” in all of its business transactions was the secret of success.\r\n\r\nThe bank’s first business home was in the Otis & Glick building,\r\nopposite the Byram Hotel. In 1869 it was moved to the Hetherington\r\nbuilding, at the northwest corner of Fourth and Commercial streets.\r\nLater on, and in 1885, the bank was moved to the southwest corner of\r\nSixth and Commercial streets, into the building erected by its\r\npresident, William Hetherington, where it has since been located.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, William Hetherington admitted into the firm, as a partner,\r\nWebster W. Hetherington, his eldest son, and in 1881, Clifford S.\r\nHetherington, his youngest son, became associated with him. In the year\r\n1882 the Hetherington Exchange Bank was incorporated under the laws of\r\nCongress, as a National bank, under the name of The Exchange National\r\nBank of Atchison, with a paid-up capital of $100,000, and surplus of\r\n$20,000, and at once took high rank as one of the strongest and most\r\nconservative banks in northeastern Kansas, and has ever since maintained\r\nthat reputation.\r\n\r\nThe Exchange National Bank was organized with William Hetherington as\r\npresident, August Byram, vice-president, Webster W. Hetherington,\r\ncashier, and C. S. Hetherington, assistant cashier. In 1890, upon the\r\ndeath of its president, William Hetherington, Webster W. Hetherington\r\nwas elected president, B. P. Waggener, vice-president, and C. S.\r\nHetherington, cashier. In 1892, upon the death of its then president,\r\nWebster W. Hetherington, B. P. Waggener was elected president, A. J.\r\nHarwi, vice-president, W. P. Waggener, vice-president, C. S.\r\nHetherington, cashier, C. W. Ferguson, assistant cashier, and Webster\r\nWirt Hetherington, teller. In October, 1906, C. S. Hetherington, the\r\ncashier, died, and C. W. Ferguson was elected cashier, and Webster Wirt\r\nHetherington, assistant cashier, and Edgar Mattocks, teller. In April\r\n1907, the capital stock of the bank was increased to $200,000.00 with a\r\nsurplus of $50,000, and ex-Governor W. J. Bailey was elected vice-\r\npresident and managing officer of the bank, which position he has since\r\nheld. Upon the death of A. J. Harwi, his son, Frank E. Harwi, was\r\nelected director, and succeeded his father, A. J. Harwi, as vice-\r\npresident, which position he now holds.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 the bank adopted a by-law, which prohibited any officer or\r\ndirector of the bank from borrowing any money from it, or becoming an\r\nendorser or surety on any obligation or note to the bank, since which\r\ntime no officer or director of the bank has been permitted to borrow any\r\nof its funds on deposit. The wisdom of this by-law adopted in 1892 has\r\nrepeatedly been approved by the comptroller of the currency. The\r\nmanagement of the Exchange National Bank has adopted and adhered to this\r\npolicy, because it believes that a bank officer or director should not\r\nbe permitted, under any circumstances or in any emergency, to use any of\r\nits deposits in any of his own personal speculations or ventures.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1914, Webster Wirt Hetherington was appointed cashier, and\r\nEdgar Mattocks was elected assistant cashier, and George L. Wolfe,\r\nteller.\r\n\r\nWhile the bank is known far and wide throughout the State of Kansas for\r\nits conservatism, yet it makes an effort to accommodate all business\r\ninstitutions in the city of Atchison entitled to assistance and credit.\r\nIt aims to be a distinctive Atchison institution.\r\n\r\nLuther C. Challiss appeared as a banker in the city directory of 1859\r\nand 1861, operating his bank at the corner of Second and Commercial\r\nstreets, but not much is known of this institution.\r\n\r\nFirst National Bank was organized on the first day of October, 1866, by\r\nDavid Auld, with the following as the first board of directors: David\r\nAuld, Henry Kuhn, H. H. Moulton, George Scarborough, C. G. Foster, D. C.\r\nNewcomb, and J. M. Linley. David Auld was elected president, George\r\nScarborough, vice-president, and W. R. Stebbins as cashier. For thirty-\r\neight years this bank was under the careful and conservative management\r\nof David Auld, who died in October, 1904, and was succeeded by his son,\r\nDavid Auld, Jr. The bank began business in July, 1867, and since that\r\ntime has been one of the strongest financial institutions in the West.\r\nIt has always had the benefit of the services of experienced men in the\r\nbanking business, and has followed a conservative policy during the\r\nwhole of its existence. In 1910 the controlling interest in the First\r\nNational Bank was purchased by the Commercial State Bank, which was\r\norganized in Atchison in 1906 by Sheffield Ingalls and O. A. Simmons. In\r\nthe merger that took place the Commercial State Bank was absorbed by the\r\nFirst National Bank, and has continued under the latter name to maintain\r\nits high standard of conservatism, and with the introduction of new\r\nblood and new methods, it embarked upon a policy of service which has\r\nredounded to the lasting benefit of the community. The present officials\r\nof this institution are as follows: Edward Perdue, president; J. H.\r\nBarry, chairman of the board; O. A. Simmons, first vice-president and\r\nmanager; J. M. Schott, second vice-president; Charles Linley, cashier;\r\nGeorge H. Edwards, assistant cashier; F. J. Ledoux, assistant cashier.\r\n\r\nThe directors represent varied business interests of this city and\r\ncounty, and are as follows: Edward Perdue, J. H. Barry, O. A. Simmons,\r\nCharles Linley, J. M. Schott, C. C. McCarthy, August Manglesdorf, Leo\r\nNusbaum, Sheffield Ingalls, A. E. Mize, M. Noll and W. T. Hutson.\r\n\r\nThe Atchison Savings Bank claims the distinction of being “The Oldest\r\nState Bank in Kansas,” having enjoyed a continuous corporate existence\r\nof over forty-six years.\r\n\r\nR. A. Park was its organizer and first cashier, and in June, 1869, it\r\nopened its doors for business in a brick one-story building at the\r\nnorthwest corner of Fifth and Commercial streets. At that time most of\r\nthe business was centered close to the river, and this was considered\r\nquite an “up town” location, but time has vindicated the judgment of its\r\nearly director in anticipating the westward growth of the town. With the\r\nexpectation of building thereon the bank early acquired title to the lot\r\nat the southwest corner of Fifth and Commercial streets, but\r\nsubsequently disposed of it to the late Ex-Governor John A. Martin, who\r\nbuilt the _Champion_ building thereon, and the bank moved to its present\r\nquarters, which it had acquired, and still owns, at the southeast corner\r\nof Fifth and Commercial.\r\n\r\nWilliam C. Smith (father of Henry T. Smith) was the first president but\r\nthe late Judge A. G. Otis soon thereafter succeeded him and remained\r\npresident until 1891.\r\n\r\nThomas Murphy (father of John Murphy and one of the builders of the\r\npresent Cain Mill Company mill), W. W. Guthrie, Julius Kuhn, C. J.\r\nDrury, Col. Wm. Osborn, J. W. Parker, and other men prominent in the\r\nbusiness and social life of that period were among its early\r\nstockholders and directors, while for seventeen years the late T. C.\r\nPlatt served as teller, and by his affability and faculty of remembering\r\npeople, made many friends for the institution. A baseball bat, kept\r\nunder the counter, was his weapon for defending the funds in his care.\r\nCourtney Challiss, George H. Lawton, “Vode” Kathrens, Lowenholt, O.\r\nOrlopp and Will H. Bryning and others also served varying terms as early\r\nemployees and will be remembered for their distinctive personalities. An\r\napothecary’s scale for weighing gold dust was part of the early\r\nequipment, but one trial was sufficient to prove the presence of too\r\nmuch dust and too little gold in the commodity offered. For almost\r\ntwenty years the bank ran with but few restrictions from the State, the\r\nlaw simply requiring it to file an annual statement of its capital,\r\nsurplus, etc., with list of stockholders and officers, and publish a\r\nstatement of its financial condition as of some one day in the year.\r\nNeedless to say the day selected was usually one on which the deposits,\r\nloans and resources would make a satisfactory showing, but about 1890\r\nthe legislature enacted a banking law, which has since been several\r\ntimes perfected by amendments, which brought this and all other State\r\nbanks under its provisions, and the supervision of a State bank\r\ncommissioner, with cast iron restrictions as to the relative amounts of\r\nloans, cash reserves, etc., and although some of the requirements seemed\r\nunduly severe to those accustomed to the former unrestrained exercise of\r\ntheir own individual judgment, few would now deny that it was wise and\r\nmuch needed legislation.\r\n\r\nFollowing the retirement from the bank in 1891 of Judge Otis, Col.\r\nWilliam Osborn became president, serving until his death, when R. A.\r\nPark succeeded to the office and served until his death in 1902. C. J.\r\nDrury being elected his successor and giving the institution his\r\nservices for about a year, seconded by J. T. Hersey as vice-president,\r\nbut both these gentlemen then retired upon the acquisition of a majority\r\nof the stock by Messrs. T. M. Walker, J. C. Fox and F. M. Baker. Of\r\nlater years the growth of the bank has been marked, the capital and\r\nsurplus having repeatedly been enlarged, and deposits and loans having\r\nshown a corresponding increase. The late Theodore Bartholow added his\r\nripe experience as a successful banker to the board of directors, while\r\nF. G. Crowell, Joseph W. Allen, William Carlisle, with Messrs. Walker,\r\nBaker and Fox and others as stockholders and directors gave the\r\ninstitution a State-wide prominence.\r\n\r\nR. A. Park, the second, who resigned as vice-president in 1911 to engage\r\nin business elsewhere, entered the bank in 1881; became cashier in 1892;\r\nelected vice-president in 1910, being succeeded as cashier by F. M.\r\nWoodford, who entered the bank’s employ in 1900 as bookkeeper.\r\n\r\nC. W. Ferguson, formerly cashier of the Exchange National Bank, has\r\nrecently been elected a vice-president of the Savings Bank, and the\r\npresent officers and directors are as follows: T. M. Walker, president;\r\nJoseph W. Allen, vice-president; C. W. Ferguson, vice-president; F. M.\r\nWoodford, cashier; W. T. Fox, assistant cashier.\r\n\r\nThe German-American State Bank of Atchison was chartered May 15, 1912,\r\nand began doing business June 21, 1912. Its original board of directors\r\nwas composed of Louis W. Voigt, Henry Klostermeier, William\r\nKlostermeier, F. A. Manglesdorf, L. A. Libel, G. T. Bolman, and F. A.\r\nManglesdorf. Three months later the charter was amended and Charles\r\nHaase and W. A. Dilgert were added to the board of directors. This bank\r\nwas organized with a capital stock of $50,000, and a surplus account of\r\n$10,000. At the first meeting of the board of directors, the following\r\nofficers were elected: Louis W. Voigt, president; Henry Klostermeier,\r\nvice-president; William Klostermeier, vice-president; F. A. Manglesdorf,\r\ncashier.\r\n\r\nAt the time the membership of the board was increased, Guy Elwell was\r\nelected assistant cashier. This bank occupies handsome quarters at the\r\nsoutheast corner of Eighth and Commercial streets, and has shown a\r\nremarkable growth since its organization. The only change in the board\r\nof directors that has been made since its organization was the\r\nsubstitution of E. F. Manglesdorf for his brother, A. F. Manglesdorf. At\r\nthe close of the first business day of the bank it had deposits\r\naggregating $25,000, and at the end of one year the deposits had\r\nincreased to $248,000, and at the end of the second year it was\r\n$323,000, and at the end of the third year it was $425,000, and in 1915\r\nit boasted of total deposits amounting to $525,000, with a surplus and\r\nundivided account of $21,000. This bank has had an able set of officers,\r\nand its directors are among the most influential and substantial\r\ncitizens of the community. It started in by making an aggressive\r\ncampaign for business, and it accomplished what it went after. The\r\ninstitution is conducted along broad and conservative lines, and renders\r\nnot only good service to its many patrons, but to the community as well.\r\n\r\nGerman Savings Bank.—This institution was organized in 1873, with the\r\nfollowing officers: George Storch, president; Robert Forbriger, vice-\r\npresident; John Belz, cashier.\r\n\r\nThe capital stock of the bank was $10,000 and its deposits were about\r\n$100,000. It conducted a general banking business, together with a\r\nregular savings department in connection therewith. This bank was\r\nlocated at 406 Commercial street, and wound up its affairs in 1886, when\r\nit was merged with the United States National Bank and the Dime Savings\r\nBank, both of which failed.\r\n\r\nThe Atchison National Bank.—This bank was organized April 1, 1873, by\r\nJohn M. Price as president; M. Barratt as cashier. G. D. Harrison\r\nsucceeded Mr. Price as president, in which capacity he served until\r\n1878, at which time he was succeeded by C. J. Drury, with R. H.\r\nBallentine as vice-president. When this bank commenced business it had a\r\ncapital of $100,000, but in 1877 it was reduced to $50,000. It was\r\nlocated for many years at 503 Commercial street, afterwards moving to\r\nwhat is now the Simpson building, in the corner occupied by the Barth\r\nClothing Company, where it failed in 19—.\r\n\r\nThe Atchison State Bank.—This bank was organized prior to 1891, and went\r\ninto voluntary liquidation March 24, 1898, at which time John M. Cain\r\nwas president and cashier, and John H. Murray was secretary. It was\r\nlocated on West Main street, near the corner of Thirteenth street.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial State bank was chartered September 8, 1906, and began\r\nbusiness October 31 of the same year, and subsequently merged with the\r\nFirst National Bank March 24, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe Union Trust Company was chartered February 28, 1907, and was\r\norganized by B. P. Waggener, with a paid-up capital stock of $100,000.\r\nMarch 24, 1909, his charter was amended and it became the Exchange State\r\nBank of Atchison, the officers of which are: F. E. Harwi, president, and\r\nEdward Iverson, cashier. This bank has a paid-up capital of $50,000,\r\nwith surplus and undivided profits of $34,776.91, with average deposits\r\nof $350,000. It is one of the strong State banking institutions of\r\nKansas, and is doing a prosperous business.\r\n\r\nAtchison county has a number of strong, flourishing banks, located at\r\nEffingham, Muscotah, Potter, Huron, Lancaster and Cummings.\r\n\r\nThe Farmers and Merchants State Bank, at Effingham, was organized in\r\n1905, with a capital of $12,000 by A. J. Smith, U. B. Sharpless, Fred\r\nSutter, R. M. Thomas and J. W. Davis. Since its organization there have\r\nbeen a few changes among the officers and the board of directors, and in\r\n1915 the officers were: Fred Sutter, president; L. T. Hawk, vice-\r\npresident; E. J. Kelley, cashier; D. R. Gerety, assistant cashier. The\r\npresent board of directors is as follows: Fred Sutter, L. T. Hawk, Alex.\r\nMcKay, U. B. Sharpless, E. J. Kelley.\r\n\r\nThe capital stock and surplus in 1915 exceeds $15,000, and the bank’s\r\naverage deposits are about $120,000. In 1910 a handsome and commodious\r\nbrick building was erected at the corner of Main and Howard streets for\r\nits new home, and it was fitted with attractive new fixtures and a\r\nburglar-proof vault of modern structures, at a cost of $4,000. This\r\ninstitution is purely a local concern, financed by local capital; all of\r\nthe stockholders reside in Effingham and vicinity, and comprise leading\r\nmerchants and farmers of the Effingham district.\r\n\r\nThe State Bank of Effingham was organized in 1889, and occupies its own\r\nquarters in a substantial and commodious brick building on the Main\r\nstreet of Effingham, which was erected in 1897. In 1912 handsome new\r\nfixtures and a burglar-proof vault were purchased at large cost. The\r\nfirst president of this bank was Wesley Cummings, and the first cashier\r\nwas Gilbert Campbell, with Harvey Sharp as assistant cashier and\r\nbookkeeper. Mr. Cummings continued as president until his death in 1899,\r\nand was succeeded by L. A. Murphy, who in turn was succeeded by T. J.\r\nBohannon, who served until his death, August 29, 1915. A. M. Ellsworth\r\nbecame cashier in 1892, and was succeeded by W. M. Walker, who served in\r\nthat capacity until 1905, when he is turn was succeeded by Clarence L.\r\nCummings, the present cashier of this substantial and growing\r\ninstitution. The president officers of the bank are as follows: R. G.\r\nBohannon, president; A. E. Mayhew, vice-president; C. L. Cummings,\r\ncashier; Carl B. Searls, bookkeeper. The directors are: H. A. McLenon,\r\nA. E. Mayhew, R. G. Bohannon and C. L. Cummings. The capital stock is\r\n$20,000, with surplus of $13,500 and deposits average $100,000. This\r\ninstitution is one of the most flourishing banks in the county, and its\r\nofficers and directors are substantial business men and farmers, who are\r\nnot only highly regarded in Effingham and vicinity, but throughout all\r\nof northeastern Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe State Bank of Lancaster was organized March, 1896, by W. W. Stepp,\r\nMark S. Cloyes, C. L. Cummings, T. J. Bohannon, and Dr. A. L. Charles.\r\nT. J. Bohannon was elected its first president, and C. L. Cummings its\r\nfirst cashier. It had a capital stock of $5,000, which subsequently was\r\nincreased to $10,000, and in 1915 it had a surplus of $5,000, with\r\ndeposits aggregating $80,000. The present directors of this bank are as\r\nfollows (1915): M. J. Hines, C. E. Smith, A. J. Smith, J. F. Shell and\r\nM. E. Smith, and its present officers are: M. J. Hines, president; C. E.\r\nSmith, vice-president; A. J. Smith, cashier, and C. G. Stickler,\r\nassistant cashier.\r\n\r\nThe State Bank of Cummings was organized by H. J. Barber and E. W.\r\nKaufman in 1908, with a capital stock of $10,000. E. W. Kaufman was\r\nelected president; B. F. Cline, vice-president, and H. J. Barber,\r\ncashier. The capital stock in 1915 was $10,000, with a surplus of $5,000\r\nand deposits aggregating $60,000. A neat and substantial brick building\r\nwas erected for banking quarters and equipped with handsome fixtures and\r\nburglar-proof vault, at a cost of $3,500. The officers of the bank in\r\n1916 were as follows: President, John Ferris; cashier, H. J. Barber, and\r\nthe directors were John Ferris, H. J. Barber, C. A. Lewis, William\r\nHegarty and F. W. Kaufman. The bank is in a thrifty condition, and has\r\nshown a steady increase in growth from the date of its organization.\r\n\r\nThe Farmers’ State Bank of Potter, Kan., was organized in 1905 by B. C.\r\nDaum, C. K. Hawley, P. C. Grenier, Arthur Davis, James Grapengieszer,\r\nFred Potter, John Niemann, C. L. Cline, J. H. Glancy, who subsequently\r\nbecame directors of this enterprising institution. The capital stock was\r\nfixed at $12,000 and the first president of the bank was B. C. Daum, and\r\nthe first cashier was C. K. Hawley. There are thirty-two stockholders in\r\nthis institution, who are practically all farmers, residing in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of Potter. In 1916 the officers were as follows:\r\nPresident, P. C. Grenier; cashier, A. H. Manglesdorf; vice-president, C.\r\nE. Hudson, and the capital stock was $12,000, with a surplus of $5,500\r\nand deposits aggregating $80,000.\r\n\r\nIt is unusual to find two substantial banking institutions in a town the\r\nsize of Potter, as it is supposed that one bank in such a community\r\nwould meet all the requirements of its citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Potter State Bank preceded the organization of the Farmers’ State\r\nBank five years. It was organized in 1900 by O. A. Simmons, L. M. Jewell\r\nand Fred Ode, with a capital stock of $5,000. O. A. Simmons remained the\r\nactive cashier and manager of the bank for two years, being succeeded by\r\nL. M. Jewell in 1902, who served until 1906. Mr. Jewell was succeeded by\r\nH. A. Ode. A new brick building was erected for this very enterprising\r\nfinancial institution in 1909, and equipped with new modern fixtures and\r\na fine burglar-proof vault. The capital stock of this bank in 1916 was\r\n$10,000, with a surplus of $10,000 and deposits aggregating $125,000.\r\nThe officers for that year were as follows: President, L. M. Jewell;\r\nvice-president, Fred Ode; cashier, H. A. Ode, and in addition to the\r\nofficers, the following prominent farmers of Walnut and Mount Pleasant\r\ntownships are directors: C. N. Faulcomer, C. W. Carson, E. H. Blodgett\r\nand Adam Ehart. There are over seventeen stockholders, all of whom are\r\nprosperous and well to do farmers, living in the vicinity of Potter.\r\nThis bank has grown rapidly, both in prestige and strength since its\r\norganization, and its average net annual profits since its organization\r\nhave been about $2,000.\r\n\r\nThe Muscotah State Bank was organized by George Storch in 1870, as a\r\nprivate bank, who remained in charge until about 1890, when Mr. Storch\r\nsold his interest to Harvey and Calvert. This firm conducted the bank as\r\na private institution until about January 1, 1902, when it was organized\r\ninto a State bank, with A. B. Harvey, president, and J. H. Calvert,\r\ncashier. Mr. Harvey remained president until about 1910, and in that\r\nyear C. C. Hart became its cashier. The officers of this institution in\r\n1916 were as follows: A. D. Wilcox, president; C. C. Hart, vice-\r\npresident; R. A. Allison, cashier. The directors are: A. D. Wilcox, C.\r\nC. Hart, A. H. Calvert, M. E. Bevens, R. A. Allison and Thomas Ryan. The\r\ncapital stock is $10,000.00, with a surplus of $10,000.00, and deposits\r\naggregating $100,000.00. This institution is the oldest bank outside of\r\nthe city of Atchison, and remains today one of the most substantial\r\nfinancial institutions in this part of the State.\r\n\r\nThe Huron State Bank was organized in 1891, with a capital stock of\r\n$10,000. The first directors were Edward Perdue, John Swartz, John\r\nDrohan, John English, David Rouse, David Rouse, Jr., and T. B. Marshall.\r\nIts first officers were Edward Perdue, president; John Swartz, vice-\r\npresident, and W. C. McLain, cashier. This is one of the substantial\r\nbanks of the county, and showed by one of its last statements a capital\r\nstock of $10,000, with surplus fund of $5,000.00 and deposits\r\naggregating $80,000.00. Its officers in 1916 are as follows: Edward\r\nPerdue, president; David Rouse, Jr., vice-president, C. E. Smith,\r\ncashier, and Cloyd Smith, assistant cashier. In addition to the\r\nofficers, T. B. Smith, Jr., is the fifth director.\r\n\r\nMr. Perdue, who is the president of this bank, is one of the leading\r\ncitizens of Atchison county, and in addition to being president of the\r\nHuron bank, is also president of the First National Bank of Atchison.\r\n\r\nC. E. Smith, the cashier, is also one of the well known and most\r\nconservative bankers of the State, and the officers and directors of\r\nthis institution have reason to be proud of the splendid growth and\r\nstanding of their institution.\r\n\r\nThe Farmers State Bank of Muscotah was organized and opened for business\r\nFebruary 21, 1910, with a capital stock of $10,000. It now has a surplus\r\nand undivided account of approximately $5,000, and its deposits average\r\n$70,000. The first directors were L. Cortelyou, A. T. Cortelyou, L.\r\nCortelyou, Jr., and H. M. Turner, who came from Moberly, Mo. W. M.\r\nWalker, of Atchison, was one of the organizers of this institution, but\r\nhe sold his interest a few weeks after organization and was succeeded by\r\nWilliam Buckles on the board of directors. L. Cortelyou was elected\r\npresident, and H. M. Turner, cashier, and they have continued as the\r\nactive officers of the bank. The present board of directors consists of\r\nL. Cortelyou, William Buckles, M. C. Vansell, John Sullivan, J. W. A.\r\nMiller and H. M. Turner. As this history is written it is said that\r\nthere has been a consolidation of the two Muscotah banks, under the name\r\nof the Farmers State Bank. A charter has been granted and the new\r\ninstitution will have a capital of $15,000. L. Cortelyou is to be the\r\npresident, H. M. Turner, cashier, and Ralph Allison, assistant cashier.\r\nThe bank will continue to occupy the present quarters of the Farmers\r\nState Bank, and the merger, when effected, will give Muscotah one of the\r\nbest banks in the county.\r\n\r\nThe Commerce Trust Company of Atchison, with a paid-up capital stock of\r\n$100,000, received its charter from the State February 11, 1916. The\r\nfirst meeting of the board of directors was held in the office of the\r\nCommerce Investment Company on the evening of February 19, 1916, at\r\nwhich time the following officers were elected: President, Sheffield\r\nIngalls; vice-presidents, Henry Diegel, A. J. Schoenecker, M. J. Horan;\r\ntreasurer, Ellsworth Ingalls; secretary, Frank H. Manglesdorf; trust\r\nofficer, H. A. Schoenecker; general counsel, J. M. Challiss. The\r\nfollowing named citizens were the first directors of the company: H. A.\r\nSchoenecker, Henry Diegel, J. C. Killarney, O. A. Simmons, A. J.\r\nSchoenecker, Ellsworth Ingalls, T. E. Snowden, Clive Hastings, M. J.\r\nHoran, F. H. Manglesdorf, H. E. Muchnic and Sheffield Ingalls. The\r\ncompany is a development of the Commerce Investment Company, established\r\nin 1910, and does a general trust business, as provided by the laws of\r\nKansas. It began business March 2, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n                               CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n  METHODIST—CHRISTIAN—PRESBYTERIAN—BAPTIST—SALEM CHURCH—GERMAN\r\n      EVANGELICAL ZION CHURCH—FIRST CHURCH OF CHRIST, SCIENTIST—ST.\r\n      PATRICK’S, MT.

BENEDICT’S ABBEY—FIRST GERMAN EVANGELICAL\r\n      LUTHERAN CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodism was introduced into Atchison by the Rev. James Shaw, who had\r\nbeen a prominent member of the Detroit conference, both as pastor and\r\nmissionary among the Indians along the Lake Superior district, and also\r\nas presiding elder. Being in poor health and desiring a new location, he\r\ncame to Leavenworth in March, 1856, and finding that Leavenworth was\r\nalready provided with a pastor, he proceeded to Atchison. He did not\r\nfind Atchison very friendly toward preachers when he arrived, and the\r\nPardee Butler incident was fresh in the minds of the people at that\r\ntime. So the Rev. Mr. Shaw went farther north, to Doniphan and Geary\r\nCity, which were Free State towns. He soon thereafter went to Detroit\r\nfor his family, and soon after his return to Geary City, he was\r\nappointed as pastor at Atchison and Monrovia. He preached his first\r\nsermon in May, 1857, in the office of S. C. Pomeroy, which was located\r\non the corner of Third and Commercial streets, and this was the first\r\nsermon from the lips of a preacher of any denomination that was\r\ndelivered in Atchison. He organized the Methodist Episcopal church in\r\nJanuary, 1858, with members from various denominations. The first\r\nservices were held in a room in the building on the southeast corner of\r\nSecond and Commercial streets. He later raised $2,000 for a new church\r\nbuilding, S. C. Pomeroy, O. F. Short and Robert McBratney each pledging\r\n$500, on condition that the new building should be located on the north\r\nside of Parallel street, near Fifth street.\r\n\r\nRev. I. F. Collins succeeded Mr. Shaw, and Rev. C. H. Lovejoy, who had\r\nbeen preaching at Lawrence for two years, was sent to Sumner. Upon the\r\narrival of Mr. Collins, he at once began the erection of the new church\r\nbuilding on Parallel street, the two lots on which the building was\r\nsubsequently erected being donated by the Atchison Town Company. The\r\ntrustees of the church at that time were: John T. Dougherty, Edwin O.\r\nCollins, Archie C. Master, David F. Beagle, William A. Butler, Joseph H.\r\nGilbert, Robert Hancock, Cyrus A. Comstock and Calvin W. Phelps. The\r\nchurch building was completed in April, 1859, and was fifty-eight feet\r\nlong and thirty-two feet wide. It had a seating capacity of 350 people,\r\nand cost $3,075. The structure was dedicated May 8, 1859, and Rev. Hugh\r\nD. Fisher, the famous Free State Methodist preacher, came up from\r\nLeavenworth and assisted in the dedication. During the first year in the\r\nnew church, two young men came to Atchison, who afterwards became\r\nsuccessful and honored citizens of the town, Samuel Gard and D. C.\r\nNewcomb. They subsequently formed a partnership and conducted a drygoods\r\nstore under the name of Gard & Newcomb, which for many years remained\r\none of the leading firms of the city. Mr. Gard died many years ago, and\r\nin 1915 Mr. Newcomb still lives. The Methodist church, perhaps, owes\r\nmore to D. C. Newcomb than any other man who was ever identified with\r\nit. His money, business sagacity and consecration have made possible the\r\nsuccess of Methodism in Atchison. His motto has always been, “It is safe\r\nto do right, and unsafe to do wrong.”\r\n\r\nButcher, Auld & Dean, famous contractors of an early day, who built the\r\nfirst railroad between Atchison and St. Joseph, with their families,\r\nunited with the Methodist church and became stanch supporters of it. J.\r\nC. Reisner, who came to Atchison in 1858, and his wife, Rebecca, were\r\nalso prominent early members of the church. They built the Tremont\r\nHouse, which for a great many years was the leading hotel, located where\r\nthe Burlington freight house now stands. Rev. Dr. Christian F. Reisner,\r\npastor of Grace Church, New York City, was the youngest son of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Reisner. The fourth session of the Kansas-Nebraska conference,\r\nwhich met in Omaha in May, 1859, returned Rev. Collins to Atchison, and\r\nduring that year Mr. and Mrs. John M. Crowell and the McCulley brothers\r\nunited with the church. In December, 1859, Abraham Lincoln, on his visit\r\nto Kansas, spoke in the little church edifice on Parallel street,\r\nreference to which has already been made in this history. In the fifth\r\nsession of the Kansas-Nebraska conference, Rev. Milton Mahen was\r\nappointed to Atchison. It was a critical period in the history of the\r\ntown, and the Rev. Mahen was admonished to be very cautious on the\r\nquestion of slavery, but he had courage and patriotism enough to order\r\nthe Stars and Stripes hoisted on his church. That year T. B. Davis and\r\nhis wife, Kathryn, came to Atchison and became useful members. “Grandma”\r\nDavis is living in 1916, and on February 21, 1915, celebrated her\r\nninetieth birthday. Owing to the great drought that visited Atchison in\r\n1860, the church did not prosper greatly during the period of Mr.\r\nMahen’s pastorate, but in the succeeding session of the Kansas\r\nconference, which met March 21, 1861, Mr. Mahen was returned to\r\nAtchison, and it was during this year that a severe storm, which\r\ndestroyed Sumner, wrecked the church building so that extensive repairs\r\nwere necessary. In the seventh session of the Kansas conference, March,\r\n1862, the Rev. Mr. James Shaw was returned to Atchison.\r\n\r\nW. M. Davies was the superintendent of the Sunday school, having been\r\nelected in 1859. In 1863 Rev. W. Marlatt was appointed for Atchison, and\r\nMarch 10, 1864, Mr. Marlatt was succeeded by Dr. W. R. Davis, who had\r\nbeen president of Baker University. Rev. Mr. Davis was retained in\r\nMarch, 1865, by the tenth session of the conference, and was succeeded\r\nby Rev. W. K. Marshall. Mr. Marshall was returned to Atchison in 1867,\r\nand in March, 1868, Rev. Hugh D. Fisher, who was known during the war as\r\nthe “fighting chaplain,” was made pastor at Atchison. He found\r\nconditions rather discouraging, but went to work to pay off the debts on\r\nthe church property and repair the building. He created a great deal of\r\ninterest in the town in religious matters, and the little church\r\nbuilding on Parallel street having become too small, two lots on the\r\ncorner of Fifth and Kansas avenue were purchased in 1870, and the\r\nbasement of the present building was erected and dedicated by Dr.\r\nFisher, who remained pastor of the church for three years. Dr. Fisher\r\nwas one of the strong preachers of Kansas in that day, and a strong\r\nanti-slavery sympathizer. He built the church at Leavenworth in 1859,\r\nwhich was one of the famous churches of the State, and popularly known\r\nas the cradle of prohibition. He was in Lawrence when Quantrell sacked\r\nthe town, and after an eventful life as pastor, chaplain and missionary,\r\nDr. Fisher died at Baldwin, Kan., October 23, 1905.\r\n\r\nRev. T. J. Leak succeeded Mr. Fisher, and it was during Mr. Leak’s\r\npastorate that the new church was dedicated, October 26, 1873. Three\r\nyears later the Rev. Mr. Leak was succeeded by Dr. George S. Dearborn.\r\nRev. William Friend succeeded Dr. Dearborn in March, 1876, who was\r\nsucceeded by E. W. Van Deventer. Dr. Philipp Krohn became pastor in\r\n1882. He was succeeded by Rev. A. H. Tevis. Dr. J. W. Alderman came to\r\nAtchison in 1887 and remained until March, 1893, and was succeeded by\r\nDr. E. H. Brumbaugh, who became pastor in March, 1893. Rev. S. V. Leach\r\nfollowed Dr. Brumbaugh in 1897, who in turn was succeeded by Rev. G. W.\r\nGrines, and since that time Dr. H. E. Wolf, Rev. W. T. Stott, Dr. I. B.\r\nPulliam and Dr. John W. Scott filled the pulpit of the church down to\r\nthe year 1914, when Rev. Thomas E. Chandler, who for five years previous\r\nhad been superintendent of the Ottawa district, became pastor of the\r\nchurch. Dr. Chandler is one of the best informed, most eloquent and\r\nbeloved pastors the church has ever had. He is not only popular among\r\nhis own church people, but has made numerous friends outside his fold.\r\nIn September, 1915, through the efforts of Dr. Chandler, assisted by Dr.\r\nC. F. Reisner, pastor of Grace Church, New York City, together with C.\r\nD. Walker and others, $42,000 was raised for the erection of a new\r\nchurch. When it is completed it will be one of the finest church\r\nedifices in Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHRISTIAN.\r\n\r\nThe Christian church was organized in Pioneer Hall, corner of Kansas\r\navenue and Fourth street, May 20, 1882, with twenty-four charter\r\nmembers. At the end of the first year there were fifty-five members, and\r\nin April, 1884, the church was incorporated under the laws of Kansas.\r\nThe first church edifice was located at the corner of Tenth street and\r\nKansas avenue, and was dedicated May 24, 1885, at a cost of $2,604. The\r\nbuilding was much enlarged during the ministry of W. H. White. In 1912,\r\nthe congregation having outgrown its old building, agitation for a new\r\nbuilding was started, and a new site was selected at Seventh and Santa\r\nFe streets, and on August 19, 1914, a beautiful new church was\r\ndedicated, which cost $47,000. The church also owns a lot adjoining the\r\nchurch, upon which a parsonage will be erected. The present membership\r\nis 1,400, and the Bible school is next to the largest in the State. The\r\nSunday school is thoroughly graded, with eight departments, sixty-five\r\nofficers and teachers, with H. P. Armstrong, superintendent. The church\r\nhas thirty deacons and elders.\r\n\r\nThe records show that as early as 1869 the Christian church had\r\nfollowers in this community, and among the pastors who served in the\r\nearly days were William C. Rodgers, James E. Gaston and C. C. Band. The\r\nearly congregation went so far as to purchase a lot at the corner of\r\nSeventh and Santa Fe streets, opposite the present new edifice, and a\r\nfoundation was laid for a building, but the plan had to be abandoned\r\nbecause of lack of funds.\r\n\r\nMiss Etta Beason, of Atchison, and T. D. McCleery, of Effingham, are the\r\ntwo surviving charter members.\r\n\r\nThe names of the pastors who have served the church since 1882 are as\r\nfollows: M. P. Hayden, W. S. Priest, J. S. Myers, Rev. Cox, W. H. White,\r\nLowell McPherson, Rev. Ingram, M. E. Harlan, E. L. Ely, W. T. Hilton, Z.\r\nE. Bates. The present pastor of the church is Rev. Jesse M Bader, one of\r\nthe most popular, aggressive and conscientious ministers in Atchison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  White Temple Christian Church, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PRESBYTERIAN.\r\n\r\nThe First Presbyterian Church was organized October 21, 1858, by a\r\ncommittee from the Presbytery of Highland, Rev. Alexander W. Pitzer, of\r\nLeavenworth, chairman. The number of persons entering into the\r\norganization on that day was eight. Their names were as follows: William\r\nM. Davies, Mary Davies, George B. Irwin, Rebecca Irwin, Annie Love,\r\nAndrew Hamilton, Maximilla Ireland and Edward Hair. The following\r\npersons have served the church as ministers: Rev. Julius Spencer, from\r\nApril, 1858, for about eighteen months; Rev. H. H. Dobbins, for seven\r\nmonths, from September, 1863; Rev. T. P. Lemis commenced his labors in\r\nApril, 1865, and continued with the church until February, 1868; Rev.\r\nEdward Cooper had charge of the church from December, 1868, until\r\nDecember, 1875; Rev. J. H. Clark officiated as pastor from March, 1876,\r\nuntil June, 1878; Rev. M. L. Howie began his labors in November, 1878,\r\nand continued with the church until November, 1882: he died in Chicago\r\nin August, 1913; Rev. D. C. Milner began his work in December, 1882, and\r\ncontinued with the church until September 23, 1887: Rev. M. L. Howie\r\n(second term), November 11, 1887, to 1897: Rev. J. D. Countermine, from\r\n1897 to 1899; Rev. B. F. Boyle came February 25, 1900, and continued as\r\npastor until in the fall of 1911. Rev. W. I. Alexander came in November,\r\n1911, and continued his labors until September, 1914. Rev. W. C. Isett\r\nwas called in September, 1915.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Presbyterian Church at Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor some months after its organization the church had no regular\r\nminister and services were held in a store room, hall and private\r\nresidences. For a time the church held meetings in Bang’s Hall on\r\nCommercial street, and in Price’s Hall, on the corner of Fourth and Main\r\nstreets. During the pastorate of Rev. Lewis, the building on Fourth\r\nstreet, between Commercial and Main streets, known as “the Presbyterian\r\nhall,” was erected, and the congregation commenced using it as a place\r\nof worship in 1865. The congregation began the erection of the present\r\nchurch building in 1880. The corner stone was laid on September 15 of\r\nthat year. About the time of beginning the building, Mrs. S. Donald,\r\nMrs. Judge Berry, Mrs. C. A. Stuart and Mrs. A. J. North canvassed the\r\ncity and secured large subscriptions to the building fund. The building\r\ncommittee consisted of A. W. Simpson, A. F. Martin and J. M. Covert. The\r\nelders in 1880 were as follows: A. B. McQueen, A. J. North, J. M.\r\nCovert, J. W. Allen, J. S. Trimble, and Harry Harkness. The deacons in\r\nthe same year were as follows: B. F. Hudson, J. Edward Lewis, S. D. D.\r\nSmith and D. M. Wynkoop. The trustees were as follows: B. F. Hudson,\r\npresident; A. F. Martin, secretary; David Lukens, treasurer; E. K.\r\nBlair, R. B. Drury, A. W. Simpson, S. D. D. Smith. Officers of the\r\nSunday school were as follows: A. F. Martin, superintendent; J. M.\r\nCovert, assistant superintendent, and J. E. Lewis, secretary and\r\ntreasurer. Officers of the Ladies’ Aid Society were as follows: Mrs. A.\r\nJ. North, president; Mrs. W. C. North, secretary; Mrs. E. K. Blair,\r\ntreasurer. Young Ladies’ Society: Miss May Seaton, president; Miss Tola\r\nThomas, secretary; Miss Nellie George, treasurer. In the year 1858 the\r\npersons active in the church at that time were: Mrs. Thomas Seip, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. William Davis, Mr. and Mrs. A. B. McQueen. The first\r\ndeaconesses were: Mrs. C. J. Parmenter and Miss Anna J. North, ordained\r\nin 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BAPTIST.\r\n\r\nThe First Baptist Church of Atchison was organized in 1858, in Allen’s\r\nHall, on the northwest corner of Second and Commercial streets. At the\r\ntime of the organization there were but nine members, of whom three are\r\nstill living and members of the church, though non-resident: Mrs. L. A.\r\nAlderson, Mrs. Aaron Stephenson and Mrs. Mary A. Challiss. Dr. W. L.\r\nChalliss was soon added to the membership. The lots on the corner of\r\nNinth street and Kansas avenue were donated by Luther C. Challiss, and a\r\nhouse of worship was erected upon it, and this location has been the\r\nhome of the church ever since.\r\n\r\nRev. L. A. Alderson was the first pastor of the church, and he served\r\nfaithfully three years without salary. Then followed Rev. Dr. Perkins\r\nfrom New Jersey, and Rev. Frank Remington.\r\n\r\nJust at this time the troubles of the war came on and very little could\r\nbe accomplished. Rev. J. W. Warder became pastor in 1866 and the church\r\ngrew strong under his ministry. Rev. H. A. Guild successfully served the\r\nchurch for a time in 1868. Rev. J. Sawyer accepted the pastorate, and\r\nthen Rev. E. Gunn.\r\n\r\nRev. J. W. Luke was pastor directly before Rev. Mulford. He baptized\r\nsome of our best workers and did excellent and permanent work for the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-fifth anniversary was fittingly celebrated at the home of\r\nMrs. John M. Price, and a silver offering was received toward a new\r\nbuilding which came soon after, under the pastorate of Rev. J. B.\r\nMulford, who was called to his reward from here.\r\n\r\nRev. D. D. Proper followed and Rev. E. P. Brand and Rev. G. W. Rogers,\r\nall of whom served the church under great difficulties. There was a\r\nheavy debt left upon the new building, which was drawing a high rate of\r\ninterest, and the constant calls for money which was paid with\r\napparently no returns, discouraged the membership. Still, the pastors\r\nresolutely worked at the great task. Rev. G. W. Rogers undertook to\r\nraise $5,000 of the mortgage, and B. P. Waggener, who had always been a\r\ngenerous contributor, gave $2,000, and made a liberal loan besides. Not\r\nlong after Rev. Rogers was called to another field, and again the church\r\nhad a pastorless period, but greatly enjoyed the ministrations of the\r\nlate Dr. Murphy. Rev. J. R. Comer was called to the pastorate June 1,\r\n1895, and faithfully served the church twelve years. Much of the money\r\npledged during Dr. Rogers’ pastorate was paid in or collected while Rev.\r\nJ. R. Comer was pastor. Then the remaining $1,500 mortgage and all other\r\ndebts were bravely taken up and paid, and the church celebrated its\r\nvictory in burning the mortgage and a general rejoicing, and also a firm\r\ndetermination never to go deeply in debt again.\r\n\r\nDuring the present pastorate of more than eight years the church has\r\nstrictly followed this rule, but this has not prevented some large\r\npurchases. In 1909 the church purchased and placed a new pipe organ at a\r\ncost of $4,500, and two years later purchased the property adjoining the\r\nchurch on the west for the accommodation of the growing Sunday school.\r\nThis was done at a cost of $5,500 for property and furniture, and the\r\nmoney was raised at a Sunday morning service. It is in the minds of many\r\nof the members of the church that in the near future there must be a new\r\nchurch building, and to that end over $6,000 has been accumulated and is\r\nbeing held for the time when the membership of the church shall be ready\r\nto erect a structure that shall be worthy of the city and an honor to\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nThe work of the church has grown and developed and every department has\r\naccepted a larger share in work, local and world-wide. Last year the\r\nchurch contributed over $1,200 for missionary and benevolent work,\r\nbesides some gifts which did not pass through the church treasury.\r\n\r\nThe church stands for a strong and helpful and constructive religious\r\nwork, and a faithful adherence to the teachings of the Bible, and a\r\nloyalty to the Lordship of Christ. The present pastor is Rev. A. J.\r\nHaggett, who has served his congregation long and well.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SALEM CHURCH.\r\n\r\nThe Evangelical Association located a mission in Atchison in 1882, with\r\nRev. C. Brandt as the first missionary. A number of German families were\r\ngathered and signified their willingness to effect a church\r\norganization. Accordingly, a hall was rented at 614 Commercial street\r\nand services held. In 1884 the organization numbered forty-seven\r\nmembers, and the Kansas conference of the Evangelical Association at its\r\nannual session in 1884 decided to build a church at this time. Rev.\r\nDaniel R. Zellner was appointed pastor, and Rev. John Wuerth, presiding\r\nelder of the Holton district. During the pastorate of Rev. D. R. Zellner\r\nin 1884 the church was built at 522 Atchison street, and dedicated by\r\nRev. John Wuerth, presiding elder, as the Salem church of the\r\nEvangelical Association, and service has continued uninterruptedly ever\r\nsince. Following are the ministers who served consecutively as pastors:\r\nRev. C. Brandt, D. R. Zellner, C. Brant, second pastorate; C. F.\r\nErffmeyer, Samuel Mueller, Jacob Schmidle, John Wuerth, C. F. Iwig,\r\nPeter Scheumann, D. R. Zellner, third pastorate; Charles Linge, F. F.\r\nErffmeyer, D. R. Zellner, fourth pastorate. L. M. Nanninga, J. M.\r\nFricker, Samuel Breithaupt, present pastor (1916).\r\n\r\nThe following served as presiding elders during the past thirty-four\r\nyears: John Wuerth, Henry Mattill, J. F. Schreiber, Albert Brunner, C.\r\nF. Erffmeyer, W. F. Wothensen and C. F. Iwig. The Evangelical\r\nAssociation was organized as a denomination in 1800, with Jacob\r\nAllbright as its founder.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the language used was German, but in the past half century\r\nthe German language was rapidly superseded by the English language. At\r\nthis time there are very few congregations in the denomination that\r\nworship in the German language exclusively. The services in the\r\nEvangelical church in this city for the past few years are conducted in\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nThis society maintains a well organized Sunday school, with weekly\r\nsessions every Sunday at 10 o’clock a. m. G. W. Bradley is\r\nsuperintendent; a Young People’s Alliance, E. B. Breithaupt, president,\r\nand a Woman’s Missionary Society, Mrs. Samuel Breithaupt, president.\r\nThis organization maintains free pews and extends an invitation to\r\nstrangers when in the city to worship with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GERMAN EVANGELICAL ZION CHURCH.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1893 a number of men, among them Rev. Nestel, of St.\r\nJoseph, Mo., who had received a special invitation, met at the home of\r\nAugust Manglesdorf, Sr., and organized a German Evangelical\r\ncongregation. It was decided to have services in Odd Fellows hall. Rev.\r\nNestel came over from St. Joe from time to time and conducted the\r\nservices. In January, 1894, Rev. C. Stork, of Concordia, Mo., took\r\ncharge of the congregation as their first own pastor. In 1894 two lots\r\nof land, at the northwest corner of Ninth and Santa Fe streets, were\r\nbought, upon which the church was built. In 1895 the congregation became\r\na member of the German Evangelical Synod of North America. In the same\r\nyear the parsonage was erected, and in 1908 a school building was added\r\nto the church. Besides Rev. Stork, the following ministers served the\r\ncongregation: H. Limper, 1897 to 1901; C. Bechtold, 1901 to 1905; P.\r\nStoerker, from 1905 to 1909, and Emil Vogt, the present pastor. Besides\r\nthe annual donations for their own church, the members have spent $2,000\r\nfor home and foreign missions. The church has a Sunday school, a\r\nteachers’ training course, a choir, a Young People’s Society, and a\r\nLadies’ Aid Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   FIRST CHURCH OF CHRIST, SCIENTIST.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  First Church of Christ Scientist, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMrs. Henrietta E. Graybill, of Milwaukee, might properly be called the\r\nfounder of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Atchison. She was\r\nthe original first reader when she came to Atchison from Kansas City in\r\n1894. In March, 1895, she began a class in instruction at the Byram\r\nHotel. This was the beginning of the local church. On September 7, 1895,\r\nthe followers met in temporary quarters in the Ingalls’ building, at\r\nSeventh and Commercial streets, seven being present. The church was\r\norganized April 9, 1895, with seven charter members. The first\r\ntestimonial meeting was held January 3, 1896, and January 15, 1896, the\r\nfirst Sunday school was organized, with seven children in attendance.\r\nBefore the end of 1896 the church was moved to more commodious quarters,\r\nat the southeast corner of Fourth and Commercial streets. These quarters\r\nwere soon outgrown, and in March, 1897, the German Methodist church at\r\nNinth and Santa Fe streets was purchased and the first services held\r\nthere were on July 4, 1897. This church was dedicated in April, 1900, by\r\nMrs. G. W. Pennell, who had become first reader, and from the start had\r\nbeen a constant and enthusiastic worker. Ten years later, March 28,\r\n1910, lots at the northwest corner of Fourth and Santa Fe streets were\r\npurchased, as a site for the permanent church. Land was secured and the\r\nfoundation started September 11, 1911; corner stone was laid July 7,\r\n1912, and first services held in the Sunday school room May 25, 1913.\r\nFirst services were held in the auditorium September 7, 1913, and the\r\nchurch dedicated October 19, 1913. Among the permanent members of the\r\nchurch are Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Pennell, Mr. and Mrs. James W. Orr, L. H.\r\nMunson, Miss N. S. Donald and Miss Emma Maage, the first reader, and D.\r\nW. Rowe.\r\n\r\nThe present church edifice was erected largely through the liberality of\r\nMr. Pennell, at a cost of $50,000, and is pronounced an architectural\r\ngem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ST. PATRICK’S, MT. PLEASANT.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick’s congregation, near Mt. Pleasant, was founded in the early\r\nfall of 1857, by the Rev. Father Augustine Wirth, O. S. B. He came from\r\nDoniphan, Kan., over the prairies and through dense timber on foot, not\r\nhaving the means to buy a horse or secure any kind of a conveyance, in\r\nthe summer of 1857. The Benedictine Fathers had been sent west by an\r\nAmerican founder, Rt. Rev. Boniface Wimmer, O. S. B., to establish a\r\npriory in the eastern part of Kansas. They settled in the hills of\r\nDoniphan, and from this county they founded and attended missions in\r\nAtchison, Brown, Nemaha and Jefferson counties. Among the first parishes\r\nestablished by these priests was one near Mt. Pleasant. Mt. Pleasant at\r\nthat time was quite a commercial center, owing largely to the overland\r\nfreighting outfits that passed through there on their way to Denver and\r\nthe Pacific coast. Patrick Durkin, who is a resident of Walnut township\r\nin 1916, and the late John Delaney were teamsters on this route, and had\r\nmany interesting experiences and struggles with Indians and Jayhawkers.\r\nFollowing the first visit of Father Augustine, after he had told the few\r\nCatholic settlers how he had traveled on foot from Doniphan, a small\r\ncongregation collected enough money to pay for a horse, saddle and\r\nbridle, and presented it to him.\r\n\r\nFather Augustine attended to the spiritual demands of the early Catholic\r\nsettlers in the Mt. Pleasant district about once a month during the\r\nperiod of his services there. There was no church edifice during that\r\nperiod, and divine services were held in the humble log cabins of the\r\nCatholic settlers, usually at the homes of John Knowles, Owen Grady, Ned\r\nCotter, Bernard Fee and James McArdle. Mary Honorah Clare was the first\r\nchild baptized at St. Patrick’s parish, September 28, 1857. The first\r\nmarriage was that of James Barry to Catherine Hennesy, May 9, 1857, at\r\nthe home of Edward Cotter. The ceremony was conducted by Rev. Augustine\r\nWirth. In the fall of 1857 the first church was built, which was a small\r\naffair, constructed out of native timber. It was poorly constructed and\r\nwas of short duration, as it was blown down by a strong wind one cold\r\nwinter day, and wrecked beyond repair. Following the destruction of the\r\nfirst church, the members concluded to build a more substantial edifice\r\nof stone, and in the spring of 1866 the walls were built. The stone work\r\nwas done by the late Nicholas Greiner, a German stone mason, who came to\r\nSumner in the late fifties, and subsequently died, one of the wealthiest\r\nfarmers of Walnut township. The church was dedicated December 8, 1866.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the church proper, the Catholic settlers of Walnut\r\ntownship, near Mt. Pleasant, have also erected a commodious parish house\r\nfor their priest, and a hall for public meetings.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the priests in charge of St. Patrick’s Church\r\nsince it was established:\r\n\r\nIrregular pastors.—Rev. Augustine Wirth, O. S. B., September, 1857, to\r\nNovember, 1859; died, December 20, 1901. Rev. Edmund Langenfelder, O. S.\r\nB., November, 1857, to December, 1860; died, April 18, 1885. Rev. Philip\r\nVogt, O. S. B., February, 1860, to January, 1861; date of death not\r\nknown. Rev. Emanuel Hartig, O. S. B., December, 1860, to June, 1861;\r\ndied, September 1, 1910. Rev. Thomas Bartel, O. S. B., April, 1862, to\r\nAugust, 1867; died, November 30, 1885.\r\n\r\nRegular pastors.—Rev. Timothy Luber, O. S. B., January, 1864, to March,\r\n1871. Rev. Placidus McKeever, O. S. B., March, 1871, to August, 1873;\r\ndied, September 22, 1896. Rev. Maurice Lynch, O. S. B., August, 1873, to\r\nAugust, 1875; died, December 13, 1887. Rev. Eugene Bode, O. S. B.,\r\nAugust, 1875, to April, 1880. Rev. Raymond Danial, O. S. B., April,\r\n1880, to September, 1880; died, September 25, 1910. Rev. Peter Kassens,\r\nO. S. B., September, 1880, to April, 1881. Rev. Adolph Wesseling, O. S.\r\nB., April, 1881, to April, 1883; died, September 24, 1891. Rev. Urban\r\nTracy, O. S. B., April, 1883, to April, 1885; died, May 13, 1915. Rev.\r\nTimothy Luber, O. S. B., April, 1885, to April, 1890; died, March 29,\r\n1901. Rev. Augustine Baker, O. S. B., April, 1890, to December, 1893;\r\ndied, June 23, 1909. Rev. Thomas Burk. O. S. B., December, 1893, to\r\nDecember, 1897. Rev. Columban Meaney, O. S. B., December, 1897, to\r\nDecember, 1910; died, January 8, 1911. Rev. Ignatius Stein, O. S. B.,\r\nJanuary, 1911, to September, 1912. Rev. Lawrence Theis. O. S. B.,\r\nSeptember, 1912, to September, 1913. Rev. Robert Salmon, O. S. B.,\r\nSeptember, 1913, to September, 1914. Rev Lawrence Theis, O. S. B.,\r\nSeptember, 1914; still in charge (1916).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TRINITY CHURCH, EPISCOPAL.\r\n\r\nThis church was organized November 3, 1857, as St. Mary Magdalene’s\r\nChurch, by Rev. Lewis R. Staudenmayer, John H. Stringfellow, Joseph P.\r\nCarr, G. W. Bowman, William O. Gould, John M. Maury, James W.\r\nStringfellow and Daniel Adams. The Rev. L. R. Staudenmayer, a German, of\r\nmiddle age, was the first pastor, and the first property owned by the\r\nparish was at the northeast corner of Kansas avenue and Ninth street,\r\nwhere a small rectory was built in 1859. The first vestry was as\r\nfollows: Richard C. Mackall, A. Hanson Weightman, James L. McClure,\r\nPhilipp Link, John M. Maury and Joseph P. Carr, and in October, 1859, a\r\ncommittee from the vestry was authorized to procure estimates for\r\nbuilding a church on its property upon Kansas avenue at a cost of\r\n$1,500. The foundation for this edifice was laid and some money\r\nexpended, but the resignation of Mr. Staudenmayer in January, 1860, and\r\nhis removal from the city, brought to a standstill the construction of\r\nthe edifice. The court house and Price’s Hall were used as places of\r\nworship for ten years. The Rev. Faber Byllsby succeeded Mr.\r\nStaudenmayer, and in 1863 the Rev. John E. Ryan succeeded Mr. Byllsby.\r\nAfter Mr. Ryan’s resignation, in September, 1864, Bishop Thomas H. Vail\r\nwas made rector of the church, and notwithstanding the manifold duties\r\nwhich pressed upon him as bishop of the diocese, he gave much of his\r\ntime to his work here, with the assistance of his son-in-law, Rev. John\r\nBakewell, who proved to be a very successful rector. It was during his\r\nrectorship that agitation for a new church building was started, and due\r\nto the efforts of Mr. Bakewell, Col. William Osborne, Richard A. Park,\r\nJudge Otis and E. S. Wills, the present church edifice at the corner of\r\nUtah avenue and Fifth street was erected, at a cost of $20,000. It is\r\nbuilt of stone, in the early English style of Gothic architecture, slate\r\nroof and interior finished in black walnut and pine, and stands today\r\none of the ornaments of Atchison. In 1871 Mr. Bakewell resigned and was\r\nsucceeded by Rev. F. Nelson Meade in January, 1872, and continued in\r\ncharge until April, 1874, when he was succeeded by the Rev Thomas G.\r\nGarver, who resigned in September, 1875. Rev. Frank O. Osborne became\r\nrector in February, 1876, and was succeeded by Rev. Abiel Leonard. Rev.\r\nM. Leonard found a congregation of 150 communicants, who in May, 1882,\r\nerected a two-story brick rectory on T street for him. It was during the\r\nRev. Mr. Leonard’s rectorship that St. Andrew’s Mission, on west\r\nCommercial street, was built. Mr. Leonard was succeeded by the Rev.\r\nFrancis K. Brooke, who in turn was succeeded by the Rev. John Henry\r\nHopkins, who built a parish house adjoining the church, which was opened\r\nfor use in 1905. Upon the resignation of Mr. Hopkins, Rev. John E.\r\nSulger became rector, but he remained only a short time, and was\r\nsucceeded by the Rev. John Henry Molineux. Rev. William R. Cross\r\nsucceeded Mr. Molineux, and then came the Rev. Francis S. White, who\r\nremained in the parish until 1911, and was succeeded by the Rev. Otis E.\r\nGray.\r\n\r\nThe present vestry of the church is composed as follows: E. A. Mize,\r\nsenior warden; Dr. W. G. Beitzel, junior warden and clerk, and W. W.\r\nHetherington, T. L. Lawrence, Clyde Hastings, J. W. Barlow, W. J.\r\nBrownson, Henry Diegel and Sheffield Ingalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ST. MARK’S ENGLISH LUTHERAN.\r\n\r\nThe history of English Lutheranism in Atchison is interesting. The work\r\nof establishing St. Mark’s was fraught with hardship and discouragement.\r\nSeveral of the early efforts failed. But the battle was renewed and\r\nsuccess at last achieved. Early in 1867 J. H. Talbott, through the\r\n_Lutheran Observer_, called attention to Atchison as a point for a\r\nLutheran mission. By correspondence he secured the interest of Rev.\r\nMorris Officer, then secretary of the general synod’s home mission\r\nboard. At the convention of the general synod at Harrisburg, Pa., in\r\n1868, the Rev. Officer persuaded the Rev. M. G. Boyer, then pastor at\r\nMarklesburg, Pa., to become a missionary to Atchison. Rev. Boyer and his\r\nyoung wife arrived here June 30, that year. Price’s Hall, South Fourth\r\nstreet, between Main and Commercial, was rented and fitted up as a\r\nmeeting place. Services were begun and a Sunday school organized. On\r\nSeptember 20, 1868, the congregation was organized with twenty-five\r\nmembers. The first church council consisted of C. Weber and H. Gehrett,\r\nelders; J. H. Talbott, J. Beamer, H. Snyder and F. Brendt, deacons.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1869 the board of church extension granted the\r\ncongregation a loan of $500, which amount was invested in the purchase\r\nof an excellent lot on Kansas avenue. There were bright hopes of having\r\na chapel soon, but these hopes were scattered when an aged minister\r\nadvised delay on account of the financial stringency of the times, and\r\nthe numerical weakness of the church. Among the members at this time was\r\nthe Rev. A. W. Wagnalls, afterward one of the founders of the publishing\r\nhouse of Funk & Wagnalls, New York City. While here he was in the real\r\nestate business. At his suggestion the congregation purchased a fifteen\r\nacre tract adjoining the city of Atchison on the northwest, which\r\nsection was platted and offered for sale with the hope of making enough\r\nprofit to erect a church building. “In this the Lutherans were\r\ndisappointed,” says the historian, “for they sold only enough lots to\r\npay for the land.”\r\n\r\nAfter that venture the congregation used the Congregational church\r\nbuilding. About that time many English Lutherans left the city. Rev.\r\nBoyer resigned at the end of the year 1869, and for ten years the church\r\nwas without a pastor. The Rev. Wagnalls supplied the pulpit now and then\r\nuntil his removal in 1876, but finally the congregation disbanded. The\r\nlots belonging to the church were sold for taxes, but were redeemed at\r\nthe eleventh hour through Mr. Talbott’s efforts, and deeded to the board\r\nof church extension.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the Rev. W. I. Cutter, a returned missionary to India, with the\r\nassistance of Rev. David Earhart and his daughter, Mrs. H. E. Monroe,\r\ngathered the English Lutherans together again. Mrs. Monroe was then\r\nconducting a private school known as the “Atchison Institute,” and she\r\noffered her school room as a place of worship. On the eighth of August\r\nthe congregation was reorganized and the following officers elected:\r\nElders, J. H. Berlin, W. H. Kuhns and N. D. Kistler; deacons, J. L.\r\nHeisey, E. D. Kistler, and John Fusselman; trustees, J. H. Talbott, W.\r\nH. Smith and S. J. Clark. Rev. Cutter served as pastor two years. During\r\npart of this time aid was received from the Home Mission Board. In 1882\r\nthis aid was withdrawn and Rev. Cutter resigned.\r\n\r\nNot until 1884 did the second organization flourish. In November of that\r\nyear the Rev. George S. Diven was commissioned to come to Atchison and\r\nrevive the mission. New interest was taken and the rejuvenated\r\ncongregation held its first service in the home of Henry Snell at 921\r\nSouth Seventh street. The Odd Fellows’ hall was then secured as a place\r\nof worship and a Sunday school was organized. Under the leadership of\r\nPastor Diven this school is said to have quickly become the largest in\r\nthe city. That year the pastor reported sixty members.\r\n\r\nAtchison’s boom season occurred during Rev. Diven’s pastorate, and\r\neverything was rushed along at a tremendous pace. The movement for a\r\nLutheran college for Atchison started at this time. The location of\r\nMidland College here was largely due to the efforts of Rev. Diven and\r\nhis congregation, supported by the public spirited citizens of the city.\r\nIn February, 1885, the church was incorporated as St. Mark’s English\r\nLutheran Church. Rev. Diven resigned in 1887 and was succeeded by the\r\nRev. W. F. Rentz, in April, 1888. Rev. Rentz set to work at once to\r\nsecure a lot and erect a church building. The present location, corner\r\nof Sixth and Park streets, was purchased for $5,000. The southern end of\r\nthe lot with the dwelling on it (now the Keith home), was sold to the\r\npastor for $1,750. The chapel (now the Sunday school room) was erected\r\nin 1888, the cornerstone being laid August 19, and the church dedicated\r\nDecember 16. The building and equipment cost $4,010. Pastor Rentz served\r\nnine years, resigning in May, 1897.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. L. S. Keyser, now professor of dogmatics in Hamma Divinity\r\nSchool, Wittenberg College, became pastor November 7, 1897, and served\r\nmost acceptably until April 7, 1903. During his pastorate the church\r\nbecame self-supporting, after receiving aid for fifteen years from the\r\nHome Mission Board. The Rev. R. W. Hufford, D. D., served as pastor from\r\nJanuary 9, 1904, to November 27, 1904. After a vacancy of nine months\r\nthe Rev. A. E. Renn became pastor August 18, 1905.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding achievement of Rev. Renn’s pastorate was the erection of\r\nthe present church building. The movement began October 21, 1907. Plans\r\nwere adopted March 17, 1908, and the building committee ordered to\r\nproceed. The cornerstone was laid during the summer following. The\r\nbuilding was erected under the supervision of A. B. Zimmerman,\r\ncontractor, and cost, including organ and furnishings, about $14,000, a\r\nmarvel of church financing. The opening service was held May 23, 1909,\r\nand marked an epoch in Kansas Lutheranism. During this pastorate the\r\ncongregation adopted the historic Lutheran vestments for pastor and\r\nchoir, and advanced in churchly worship. Rev. Renn resigned September 1,\r\n1911.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Howard C. Garvic was installed pastor the first Sunday in\r\nMarch, 1912. No pastor of St. Marks surpassed him in zeal and energy for\r\nthe upbuilding of the Lord’s kingdom. Day and night he labored in\r\npersonal appeal and in teaching classes of adults and children. In a\r\nlittle more than two years 175 names were added to the church roll,\r\nconstituting the largest growth of any pastorate. The death of the\r\npastor in the prime of manhood in March, 1915, produced a profound\r\nimpression upon St. Mark’s and the city of Atchison. The Rev. Robert L.\r\nPatterson. D. D., became pastor October 17, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. BENEDICT’S ABBEY.\r\n\r\nSt. Benedict’s Abbey, church and college, are conducted by the\r\nBenedictine Fathers. The first Benedictine father that came to Kansas\r\nwas Henry Lemke, O. S. B., who arrived in Doniphan in 1855, where he\r\nlaid the foundation of a monastery. He was shortly followed to Kansas by\r\na number of brother workers, who were sent here by Father Boniface\r\nWimmer, O. S. B., who founded the monastery of St. Vincent’s, in\r\nWestmoreland county, Pennsylvania. They immediately opened a Latin\r\nschool with a few pupils, but Very Rev. Augustine Wirth, O. S. B., soon\r\ndiscovered that Atchison would surpass Doniphan, and on this account the\r\nCatholic brothers transferred their home to Atchison in about 1859. The\r\nRev. Augustine Wirth, O. S. B., came to Atchison from Doniphan once a\r\nmonth to hold religious services, which were conducted in the home of\r\nCharles Burnes, located on the southwest corner of Second and L streets.\r\nThe following year Father Augustine built a frame parish church in which\r\nservices were held for the first time on Christmas day. In this rude\r\nstructure the faithful worshipped until about 1865, when the parish,\r\nhaving increased to such number, it became necessary to build a larger\r\nchurch. Under the aggressive leadership of Father Augustine, the\r\nparishioners concluded to invest in this structure $25,000. Francis\r\nGeorge Himpler, now living in New York, and for many years a partner of\r\nthe late J. P. Brown, was employed as architect. The work was pushed\r\nforward and instead of the proposed church, a magnificent Basilica was\r\nconceived, and the construction of it was carried forward with great\r\nearnestness. The foundation was completed in 1866, and the cornerstone\r\nwas laid in October. The Rev. John Hennessy, O. S. B., who later was\r\narchbishop of Dubuque, and one of the most eloquent orators of the\r\nchurch, delivered the dedication sermon. To obtain brick for the church\r\nwalls, Father Augustine bought expensive machinery, and, under the\r\nsupervision of the late Peter Bless, started a brickyard in East\r\nAtchison, but the undertaking proved a failure, as the bricks were not\r\nserviceable for the church. Instead of using them in the construction of\r\nthe church they were used to build several cottages and store buildings\r\nin the immediate neighborhood and, later on, when suitable bricks were\r\nobtained, the work on the church was continued, and by the summer of\r\n1868 the walls were finished to the window sills.\r\n\r\nFather Augustine resigned June 18, 1868, and went to Minnesota, and\r\nsubsequently died while pastor at Melrose in that State, December 19,\r\n1901, at the age of seventy-three years. He was succeeded by the Very\r\nRev. Louis Mary Fink, O. S. B., July, 1868, and it was during his\r\npastorate that the church was solemnly dedicated Trinity Sunday, 1869,\r\nbut it was not completed at that time, and, in fact was not completed\r\nfor many years thereafter. The church is built in Roman style and is 152\r\nfeet long and fifty-six feet wide. Father Louis was succeeded by the\r\nVery Rev. Giles Christoph, O. S. B., who was appointed prior in July,\r\n1871. In January, 1875, Very Rev. Ouswald Moosemueller, O. S. B., became\r\nprior. Under his direction the church flourished and he is particularly\r\nremembered for his exertions in founding and building up a good library\r\nfor the church and school. The members of the church had grown\r\nsufficiently large, so that the priory was promoted to an abbey April 7,\r\n1877, and on September 29 of that year Rev. Innocent Wolf, O. S. B., was\r\nelected abbot, and still retains his place (1916), loved by all. Rev.\r\nInnocent Wolf’s election as abbot was celebrated with appropriate\r\nceremonies, and the Very Rev. Boniface Verheyen, O. S. B., was appointed\r\npastor, and at that time the status of the house was as follows: Rt.\r\nRev. Innocent Wolf, O. S. B., abbot; Very Rev. Boniface Verheyen, O. S.\r\nB., prior; Very Rev. Pirmin Kaumly, O. S. B., prior of St. Benedict’s;\r\nRev. Augustine Wirth, O. S. B., Emanuel Horlig, O. S. B., Rev. Timothy\r\nLuber, O. S. B., Rev. Peter Kassens, O. S. B., Rev. Eugene Bode, O. S.\r\nB., Rev. Adolph Wesseling, O. S. B., Rev. Ferdinand Wolf, O S. B., Rev.\r\nWinfried Schmidt, O. S. B., Rev. John Steoder, O. S. B.; and Rev.\r\nMatthew Bradley, O. S. B. Besides these there were four priests from St.\r\nVincent’s, Pa., who acted as assistants, whose names were Rev. Ambrose\r\nHuebner, O. S. B., Rev. Casimir Elsesser, O. S. B., Rev. Theodore\r\nSchmitt, O. S. B., and Rev. Anslem Soehuler, O. S. B. There were seven\r\nclerics, ten lay brothers, five candidates and ten scholastics. Rev.\r\nCharles Stoekle, O. S. B., succeeded Father Adolph as pastor of St.\r\nBenedict’s Church in 1890, and remained pastor until 1898, when he was\r\nsucceeded by Rev. Longinus New, O. S. B., who was one of the most\r\nbeloved and active pastors of the church. He was a priest burning with\r\nzeal and he delighted in preaching. He was a powerful speaker, and his\r\nsermons were always well prepared and written out. He had a strong\r\nvoice; used plain and simple language, and spoke with such zeal and\r\nsincerity that he left a lasting impression on all of his hearers. His\r\nhealth failed him, however, and he was compelled to seek a southern\r\nclimate, and died in a hospital at Birmingham, Ala., March 2, 1899, aged\r\nfifty-three years, and in the twenty-eighth year of his priesthood. He\r\nwas succeeded by Rev. Girard Heinz, O. S. B., who was appointed to take\r\nhis place January 1, 1899, and Father Girard remains the pastor of the\r\nchurch in 1916.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  St. Benedict’s Abbey, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Rt.

Liebe, home missionary\r\nof the Evangelical Lutheran synod of Missouri, Kansas, Ohio, and other\r\nstates. The first regular minister was Rev. Mr. Menge, who was installed\r\nin 1867. Rev. G. Landgraf succeeded Mr. Menge in December and was\r\ninstalled the first day of that month. The church building at the corner\r\nof Tenth and Commercial streets was dedicated at the same time. In 1869\r\na parsonage, adjoining the church, was erected, and the following year\r\nC. Janzow, of Weston, Mo., succeeded Mr. Landgraf, who in turn was\r\nfollowed by Rev. C. Hartman, who died in the fall of 1872, and after\r\nwhich the call was extended to Rev. W. Zschoche, of Miami county,\r\nKansas. Under the pastorate of Rev. Mr. Zschoche the congregation\r\nincreased to a membership of 130, and a day school was conducted in\r\nconnection with the church by Mr. Zschoche until 1881.\r\n\r\nRev. C. Vedder succeeded Rev. Zschoche, who in turn was succeeded by\r\nRev. Theodore Bundenthal, whose untimely death in the latter part of\r\n1915 deprived the church and its congregation of one of the best\r\nministers it ever had. Mr. Bundenthal was succeeded by Rev. Frederic\r\nNiedner, who is in charge of the church in 1916. The present church\r\nbuilding at the corner of Eighth and Laramie streets was built in 1889.\r\nThere are 500 communicants and the church is affiliated with the\r\nMissouri synod.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the churches already enumerated, there are several negro\r\nchurches, of which the Ebenezer Baptist Church, organized in 1867, and\r\nthe African Methodist Episcopal Church, organized in the summer of 1868,\r\nare the most prominent. There are also several other denominations\r\nrepresented in Atchison, including the Latter Day Saints, and the Holy\r\nRollers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n                       EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\n  FIRST SCHOOLS, PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS—ESTABLISHMENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS—\r\n      EARLY SCHOOLS AND PIONEER TEACHERS—DISTRICT SCHOOLS—STATISTICS—\r\n      MANUAL TRAINING—ATCHISON COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL—COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS\r\n      OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION—ATCHISON CITY SCHOOLS—PRIVATE SCHOOLS—MT.\r\n      ST.

BENEDICT’S COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the turmoil and confusion that accompanied the movement of\r\npopulation into Atchison when the town and county were organized, the\r\nquestion of schools appeared to be a secondary one. It was not until the\r\nbitter days of 1854, 1855 and 1856 had passed that the attention of the\r\npeople was directed to this important question. The first schools in\r\nAtchison were private institutions, and a number of them flourished\r\nuntil after the beginning of the Civil war. Among those which were first\r\nin the educational field here was the Baptist Seminary, at the northeast\r\ncorner of Eleventh and Santa Fe streets. It was a school for young women\r\nand was conducted by Mr. Stork. Later Mrs. Lizzie Abbott, who afterwards\r\nbecame the wife of Judge Cassius C. Foster, conducted a young ladies’\r\nschool at the northeast corner of Sixth and Laramie streets, and in the\r\neighties Miss Mary Teasdale conducted a private school at the same\r\nplace. Miss Lizzie Bay, the daughter of Hugh Bay, a prosperous farmer\r\nliving southwest of Atchison, was also active in early day educational\r\naffairs, and so was Mrs. Amanda Blair, at that time Miss Amanda Meeker,\r\nwho is a resident of Atchison in 1916. Mrs. Blair was the first teacher\r\nin Atchison county. While there was no activity in educational affairs\r\nduring the period just mentioned, the first Territorial legislature did,\r\nin fact, pass a law in the summer of 1855 providing for the\r\nestablishment of common schools, but the history of the Atchison county\r\nschool system did not begin until 1858. The city of Atchison, District\r\nNumber 1, was organized August 5, 1858. On September 13th of that year a\r\nmeeting was held in the law office of Franklin B. Adams, and the\r\nfollowing school officers were elected: James A. Coulter, director; Dr.\r\nWilliam Grimes, treasurer, and Franklin G. Adams, clerk. O. F. Short was\r\nthe other member. Phillip D. Plattenburg, who had previously served as\r\ncounty superintendent of Fulton county, Illinois, was elected principal\r\nof the schools and Mrs. Blair his assistant. School was opened the first\r\nweek in November, in two rooms over Bury’s Grocery Store, on the corner\r\nof Fourth and Commercial streets, where the Y. M. C. A. building now\r\nstands. The next year the corps of teachers had increased to four, and\r\nMiss Lizzie Bay and Miss Melissa Kipp, who subsequently became the wife\r\nof Chief Justice Martin, became the other two teachers. The school was\r\nmoved to the old Masonic building further west on Commercial street,\r\nwhere it was conducted for two years. Mr. Plattenburg was also appointed\r\ncounty superintendent, and the first teacher’s certificate issued by him\r\nin Atchison county was to D. W. Rippy, who died in Severance, Kan., in\r\n1914, the richest man in Doniphan county. Mr. Rippy taught the first\r\nschool in the Second district, organized near the Waggener farm,\r\nsouthwest of Atchison. Mrs. Blair had her teaching certificate when she\r\narrived in Atchison, as one was issued to her by Dr. Plattenburg in\r\nFulton county, Illinois, before she came to Atchison. Her school opened\r\nin Atchison the first Monday in November, 1858, and she had charge of\r\nthe primary and intermediate departments. Dr. Plattenburg received a\r\nsalary of $100.00 a month and Mrs. Blair a salary of $45.00, which was\r\nincreased to $50.00 by Dr. Plattenburg giving her $5.00 of his own\r\nsalary. Mrs. Blair had sixty-five pupils. Mrs. Blair says that the first\r\nspelling match in Atchison county took place in W. D. Rippy’s school.\r\nShe participated in the spelling match, and was spelled down on the word\r\n“Poisonous.”\r\n\r\nMr. Plattenburg served in the capacity of principal and superintendent\r\nof schools until May, 1861, when the schools were closed for lack of\r\nfunds. Because of the Civil war very little progress in education was\r\nmade, and the records of the county superintendent’s office for that\r\nperiod are not available. The earliest record in the office of the\r\ncounty superintendent concerning the schools of Atchison county is found\r\nin an old record book of July 7, 1863, as follows:\r\n\r\n“Through the kindness of the present board of County Commissioners, E.\r\nLeighton, B. Wallack and C. G. Foster, this book was furnished for the\r\nrecords of the public schools of Atchison county. It is hoped that every\r\nsuperintendent, into whose possession this book may fall, will perform\r\nevery duty devolving upon him officially, and make every effort to\r\nadvance the cause of education.\r\n\r\n                                            “ORLANDO SAWYER,\r\n                                  “Superintendent of Public Instruction,\r\n                                  “Atchison County.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Old High School Building, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the records of County Superintendent Sawyer,\r\nwho held his office from 1863 to 1867, are somewhat incomplete, they\r\ncontain much interesting information.\r\n\r\nThe average length of the school term for the first year was three and\r\none-half months, and in some districts, owing to the distance and the\r\nrigors of the winter climate, school was held only during the summer\r\nmonths. Among the early teachers in this county were Miss Lizzie Keith,\r\nwho taught in District No. 29 in 1863; Miss Mary A. Shields, who taught\r\nin District No. 16 in the same year; Miss Helen L. Bishop, of District\r\nNo. 26, and Miss Stewart, of District No. 31. Miss Bishop was a pioneer\r\nin advocating the teaching of vocational subjects in the public schools,\r\nincluding domestic science, manual training, agriculture and sewing, and\r\nfor her zeal in this respect she was derided and laughed at. Women\r\nteachers in those days, as now, outnumbered the men. The following are\r\nthe names of those who received teacher’s certificates in 1863: July 8,\r\nMichael Roach; July 27, Mrs. Esther Thayer; July 30, W. D. Barnett;\r\nAugust 15, Mary A. Shields; August 15, Solomon K. McCrary; August 27,\r\nRichard Dunn; September 14, Martha Stewart; September 25, Allen Abbott;\r\nSeptember 27, Adelia Guest; October 11, Carlos E. Pease; October 14,\r\nJohn C. Butman; November 23, I. J. Adams; December 1, R. S. Cook;\r\nDecember 4, L. A. Messenger; December 4, Harriet Hollister, and December\r\n4, W. R. DeWitt.\r\n\r\nThere were thirty-one districts in the county in that year, and the\r\namount of State funds apportioned to Atchison county was $295.30. The\r\nschool population was 1941, with an enrollment of 1,072, and an average\r\ndaily attendance of 500. Twenty-nine teachers were employed, twenty-two\r\nwomen and seven men, with an average monthly salary for the men of\r\n$25.20 and $16.75 for the women. The total valuation of school houses\r\nwas $1,050, and the amount of money received from the county was\r\n$827.05.

In\r\nthat year there were forty-six organized school districts, and a school\r\npopulation of 3,878, with a total enrollment of 2,247, and an average\r\ndaily attendance of 1281. The term for white children was increased to\r\nfive and one-half months and for colored children to ten months. There\r\nwas a total of sixty-four teachers, of whom thirty-seven were women and\r\ntwenty-seven men. The wages of the men were $42.92 a month, and for the\r\nwomen, $28.76 a month, and there was a total of $15,117.87 paid out for\r\nwages. The amount received from the State was $2,627.09, and an\r\nadditional source of revenue was from the pounding of stray livestock,\r\nwhich brought into the school fund of the county that year $589.58. The\r\namount raised by district school tax was $24,373.21, and there were\r\nforty-three school houses in the county, of which twelve were built of\r\nlogs, twenty-six of frame construction, and five of stone, with a total\r\nvaluation of $16,750.00. During the interim between 1863 and 1868, the\r\nThird Kansas Teachers’ Association met in Atchison. The meeting was held\r\nJuly, 1865, and there were fifty-nine teachers present in Price’s Hall.\r\nJohn A. Martin, John J. Ingalls and Geo. W. Glick attended the meeting\r\nand made addresses.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the figures of those days, the figures of 1915 are\r\ninteresting, and they are here given as follows:\r\n\r\n School population, June 30, 1915                                  3,530\r\n Total enrollment, 1914–1915                                       2,477\r\n Average daily attendance, 1914–1915                               1,915\r\n Teachers employed, 1915–1916, including county\r\n   high school, males 23, females 81                                 104\r\n Teachers employed 1915–1916, including county\r\n   high school, holding State certificates                            19\r\n Normal training 33, first grade 22, second grade\r\n   27\r\n Teachers without previous experience                                 21\r\n Teachers serving first year in present positions                     56\r\n Teachers more than two years in  present position                    16\r\n Average experience of teachers:\r\n      One-teacher schools                                        5 years\r\n      Graded schools                                             6 years\r\n Average length of term in weeks:                     1914–15    1915–16\r\n      One-teacher schools                                30.4      30.65\r\n      Graded schools                                     35.3      35.33\r\n Average salary of male teachers:                     1914–15    1915–16\r\n      One-teacher schools                               63.75      67.25\r\n      Graded schools                                    84.77      85.81\r\n Average salary of female teachers:                   1914–15    1915–16\r\n      One-teacher schools                               58.16      57.45\r\n      Graded schools                                    59.64      60.00\r\n Average attendance per teacher:                      1914–15\r\n      One-teacher schools                                  21\r\n      Graded schools                                       26\r\n Average cost per pupil per month in attendance:                 1914–15\r\n      One-teacher schools                                       $   3.69\r\n      Graded schools                                                4.38\r\n Amount expended for school purposes:                            1914–15\r\n      One-teacher schools                                     $39,756.47\r\n      Graded schools                                           19,212.88\r\n      County high school                                       17,719.71\r\n                                                                   —————\r\n Total                                                        $76,689.06\r\n\r\n Common school graduates, 1915:\r\n      Boys 57, girls 71, total 128.\r\n High school graduates, 1915:\r\n      Boys 17, girls 19, total 36.\r\n Total number of libraries in rural schools                           63\r\n Number of volumes in rural libraries                              4,314\r\n Number of schools having room or basement\r\n   furnaces                                                           66\r\n Number of county certificates issued during year:\r\n      First grade                                           9\r\n      Second grade                                         24\r\n      Third grade                                           7  Total  40\r\n Number of first grade renewed                                         5\r\n Number of State certificates registered                               7\r\n Number teachers normal training certificates\r\n   registered                                                         13\r\n Number of first grades indorsed                                       3\r\n Number of second grades indorsed                                      1\r\n\r\nThe city of Atchison is not included in any of the above statistics.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the vision of Miss Helen E. Bishop of\r\n1863 has been realized, for in every school in Atchison county, not only\r\nagriculture is taught, but in about one-third of the schools, plain\r\nsewing and various kinds of fancy needlework are taught also, and while\r\nno rural school as yet is equipped to teach cooking, a number of the\r\nteachers are directing some work along this line and it is done in\r\naccordance with the teacher’s directions in the homes, with the\r\nassistance of the mothers. More attention than ever is also being given\r\nto drawing and music. Earnest efforts are being made by superintendents\r\nand teachers to secure the coöperation of parents by means of community\r\ngatherings. In many districts teachers’ associations, literary societies\r\nand debating clubs have been organized, in which parents as well as\r\nchildren are taking a great interest. Many of the districts have availed\r\nthemselves of the opportunity to use the stereopticon lectures sent out\r\nby the University of Kansas. Lecture courses are being made in some of\r\nthe schools, and provisions have been made for serving hot lunches for\r\nchildren. Medical inspection is also provided for, through the efforts\r\nof teachers. One of the most interesting and valuable features\r\nintroduced into the rural school work of the county in recent years is\r\nthe community school fair. The plan is to have three to five schools\r\nunite and meet at a school house, where the children enter exhibits of\r\ncorn, cereals, seeds of various kinds, vegetables and fruits, and in\r\naddition to these are also exhibited canned fruits, peaches, jelly and\r\nloaves of bread, and other samples of the art of cooking, together with\r\narticles of fancy needlework and plain sewing. Many prizes are awarded\r\nfor the best exhibit, and the result is that much interest is stimulated\r\namong the children in these accomplishments. The county farm agent is\r\nalso lending great assistance in organizing school gardens, and boys’\r\nand girls’ clubs of various kinds for the purpose of agricultural\r\ndevelopment. Much attention is also paid to the supervision of the\r\nchildren at play, on the theory that all work and no play makes Jack a\r\ndull boy, and the equipment for the playground of various kinds has been\r\nsupplied. Six rural schools of the county have organized basketball\r\nteams.\r\n\r\nBesides the rural and graded schools, Atchison county has four high\r\nschools. Muscotah maintains an accredited four-year high school,\r\noffering a college preparatory and general course, and the school\r\nbuilding which was destroyed by fire January 13, 1916, will be replaced\r\nby a larger and better school, reference to which has already been made\r\nin this history.\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of J. S. Blosser, an excellent two year high school\r\nis maintained in Huron.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE ATCHISON COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 Atchison county, in accordance with an act of the Kansas\r\nlegislature of 1866, established the second county high school in the\r\nState, and it was due to the efforts of Senator B. F. Wallack, and also\r\nthe efforts of the public spirited citizens of Effingham, that this\r\nschool was located there. The first board of trustees of this school\r\nwere as follows: A. J. Harwi, A. S. Best. J. E. Logan, F. E. Cloyes, L.\r\nR. Spangler and W. E. Knight. John Klopfenstein, who was at that time\r\ncounty superintendent, became the first president of the board.\r\n\r\nThe present site, which comprises a spacious campus of eight acres, was\r\npurchased by the city of Effingham and donated to the county. A handsome\r\npressed brick and stone building was erected in compliance with plans\r\nand specifications designed by Alfred Meier, of Atchison. The building,\r\ncosting more than $22,000.00, was completed in June, 1891. School opened\r\nSeptember 14, 1891, with F. J. Squires, principal, assisted by J. O.\r\nWard, Miss Julia Heath, and Miss N. Grace Murphy. Three courses of study\r\nwere provided for: Normal, general and college preparatory.\r\n\r\nOn the night of November 6, 1893, the building was destroyed by fire.\r\nSchool was opened the next morning and was continued the remainder of\r\nthe year down town in lodge rooms, churches, and the public school\r\nbuilding. The present building, erected on the same site, was ready for\r\noccupancy by the fall of 1894.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the names of the principals who have served the school: J.\r\nF. Squires, 1891 to 1893; S. J. Hunter, 1893 and 1896; J. W. Wilson,\r\n1896 to 1907; W. H. Keller, 1907 to 1908; E. H. McMath, 1908 to 1911: J.\r\nR. Thierstein, 1911 to 1915, and A. J. McAllister and G. W. Salisbury.\r\n1915 to 1916.\r\n\r\nThe county high school exists mainly to afford free high school\r\neducation to every boy and girl in the county. Since its students come\r\nprincipally from the rural districts, it must educate them to become\r\nbetter homemakers and better farmers, and to appreciate more fully the\r\nadvantages of rural life. It must also help prepare better teachers for\r\nthe rural schools and train them for business as well as for college.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Atchison County High School, Effingham, Kansas\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt has grown in efficiency and influence until it is recognized as one\r\nof the best high schools in the State and is on the accredited list of\r\nthe North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. This\r\nmeans that our school is recognized by the colleges of Kansas, Oklahoma,\r\nMissouri, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana,\r\nIllinois, West Virginia, South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado, which admit\r\nour graduates without examination.\r\n\r\nThe faculty has increased in number from four in 1892 to twelve in 1915.\r\nThe number of graduates in 1892 was two, in 1915, thirty. Since its\r\norganization the departments of commerce, music, manual training,\r\ndomestic art, domestic science, and agriculture have been added, a\r\nfarmers’ short course established, and a demonstration farm in\r\nconnection with the work in agriculture put into operation.\r\n\r\nThe school is well equipped in laboratories, and has a library of 3,000\r\nvolumes, and all the leading magazines and papers. A lively interest is\r\ntaken in athletics, both Young Men’s Christian Association and Young\r\nWomen’s Christian Association have a large membership. Every year the\r\nstudents have the benefit of a splendid lecture course.\r\n\r\nFrom its halls have been graduated 387 young men and young women, who\r\nare now filling positions of honor as doctors, lawyers, ministers,\r\nteachers, superintendents, farmers, bankers and missionaries, and are\r\nfound in nearly every State in the Union and in some foreign countries.\r\n\r\nAtchison county further increased its educational advantages in June,\r\n1915, by establishing at Potter, a rural high school, in accordance with\r\na law passed by the legislature in 1915. This district is known as Rural\r\nHigh School, District No. 1, and comprises 26½ square miles, including\r\nportions of nine school districts, five of which lie wholly in Atchison\r\ncounty, and the four others jointly in Atchison, Jefferson and\r\nLeavenworth counties.\r\n\r\nAugust 9, 1915, the first school meeting in this district was held, and\r\nJ. E. Remsburg was elected director, T. F. Hall, treasurer and D. H.\r\nStrong, Jr., clerk. It was not necessary for this district to vote bonds\r\nfor a building, because Union District No. 1, which includes Potter, and\r\nis a part of the new high school district, already had a beautiful\r\nmodern four-room structure, which was leased to the newly organized high\r\nschool district. A. T. Foster was elected first president, and Miss\r\nSarah Armstrong, assistant. The school opened September 6, 1915, with an\r\nenrollment of eighteen pupils. The course of study is that prescribed by\r\nthe State, board of education, and covers four years.\r\n\r\nThe year 1915–16 has been a year of progress for the schools of Atchison\r\ncounty. The State department of education, by virtue of authority given\r\nthem by the State legislature in 1915, established a definite standard\r\nof efficiency for the rural schools of the State, and formulated plans\r\nfor standardizing rural schools. As a result, two rural school\r\nsupervisors were added to the State department. J. A. Shoemaker, county\r\nsuperintendent of this county, was appointed as one of those\r\nsupervisors, and was succeeded in office by Miss D. Anna Speer, who is\r\nmaking one of the most earnest and efficient county superintendents this\r\ncounty has ever had. It is universally conceded that the board of county\r\ncommissioners made no mistake when they selected Miss Speer as a\r\nsuccessor to Mr. Shoemaker. Miss Speer is making an earnest effort to\r\nbring our schools up to the standard set by the State department of\r\neducation, in which she is receiving the cordial coöperation on the part\r\nof the school officers, parents and children of the county. The work\r\nthat is being accomplished here has been highly commended by Miss Julia\r\nStone, one of the new State supervisors, and three schools, approved by\r\nthe supervisor, have the honor of the first three “Standard Schools” in\r\nnortheastern Kansas. These are: New Malden District No. 45, H. S. Mahan\r\nand Eugene Crawford, teachers; Lancaster District No. 10, O. E. Seeber\r\nand Miss Ione Gibson, teachers, and White Clay District No. 6, J. M.\r\nPennington, teacher. In 1915 the County Normal Institute was combined\r\nwith Midland College Institute, at Midland College. A six weeks’ session\r\nwas held, June 15 to July 28. Besides thorough reviews of all subjects\r\nrequired for county teachers’ certificates, numerous courses for college\r\ncredit were offered. The corps of instructors consisted of county\r\nsuperintendent, Miss D. Anna Speer: professors, W. E. Tilberg. E. M.\r\nStahl, S. L. Soper, D. W. Crouse. C. F. Malmberg and Bruno Meinecke.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of county superintendents of public instruction\r\nof Atchison county from the beginning of our history to the present\r\ntime:\r\n\r\n Philip D. Plattenburg, served September, 1858, to May, 1861.\r\n Orlando Sawyer, served July, 1830, to January, 1867.\r\n Norman Dunsher, served January, 1867, to January, 1869.\r\n Thomas F. Cook, served January, 1869, to January, 1873.\r\n J. E. Remsburg, served January, 1873, to January, 1877.\r\n Mr. Martin, served January, 1877, to January, 1879.\r\n W. H. Tucker, served January, 1879, to January, 1883.\r\n A. G. Drew, served January, 1883, to January, 1885.\r\n J. F. Class, served January, 1885, to January, 1887.\r\n George A. Ward, served January, 1887, to January, 1889.\r\n John Klopfenstein, served January, 1889, to January, 1893.\r\n Samuel Ernst, served January, 1893, to January, 1895.\r\n C. E. Reynolds, served January, 1895, to January, 1899.\r\n John Klopfenstein, served January, 1899, to January, 1901.\r\n E. E. Campbell, served January, 1901, to May, 1901.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas legislature of 1901 changed the date of beginning of\r\nsuperintendent’s term from the second Monday in January to the second\r\nMonday in May, thus creating a vacancy in the office for four months.\r\nMr. Campbell was appointed by the county commissioners to serve during\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\n John Klopfenstein, served May, 1901, to May, 1903.\r\n O. O. Hastings, served May, 1903, to May, 1907.\r\n J. W. Campbell, served May, 1907, to March 18, 1909, when he died.\r\n J. A. Shoemaker, served March 23, 1909, to July 1, 1915.\r\n D. Anna Speer, served July 1, 1915, and still remains superintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ATCHISON CITY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nIt was lamentable, but, nevertheless true, that there were many\r\nresidents of the city of Atchison of the early period in its history who\r\ndoubted the justice of supporting free schools. In 1860 the school board\r\nrefused to levy a tax for school purposes in the city of Atchison.\r\nFollowing this, however, a more progressive spirit prevailed, and free\r\nschools were regularly supported by annual tax levies. For ten years the\r\nschools occupied rented quarters, excepting two frame buildings in South\r\nAtchison. The basement of the Congregational church, the lower floor of\r\nthe old Masonic building that stood near the corner of Eighth and\r\nCommercial streets, the upper floor of the Auld building on Commercial\r\nstreet, near Sixth, Price’s Hall and probably other buildings were used\r\nduring those years.\r\n\r\nThere was little or no general supervision of the work of the schools up\r\nto 1866, little or no system, and little distinction between public and\r\nprivate schools.\r\n\r\nDuring this unorganized period the business affairs of the schools were\r\nadministered by a district board of three members.\r\n\r\nUnder a law approved March 1, 1867, the Atchison city schools were\r\norganized June 3, 1867, at which time the first board of education of\r\nAtchison was elected, as follows: First ward, Wm. Scoville, Wm. C.\r\nSmith; Second ward, M. L. Gaylord, L. R. Elliott; Third ward, John A.\r\nMartin. Julius Holthaus; Fourth ward, Geo. W. Gillespie, Jacob Poehler.\r\nIn the organization of the first board, Wm. Scoville was elected\r\npresident, John A. Martin, vice-president, and M. L. Gaylord, clerk.\r\n\r\nThe board consisted of eight members until Atchison became a city of the\r\nfirst class in 1881, at which time the ward representation was increased\r\nto three members each, giving a board of twelve members. At the\r\norganization of the first enlarged board, J. C. Fox was elected\r\npresident; J. B. Kurth, vice-president. The time of organization was the\r\nfirst regular meeting in August, a change from the former time, the\r\nfirst regular meeting in May, which was the law till 1881. During this\r\nyear the time of organization was extended three months, giving fifteen\r\nmonths’ service under the organization of May, 1880. Another change made\r\nat this time was the election of a clerk not a member of the board. At\r\nthe organization, August 1, 1881, M. Noll was elected clerk. He was\r\nsucceeded in October, by C. N. Seip, who was followed in May, 1882, by\r\nJames H. Garside.\r\n\r\nBy the addition of the Fifth ward, 1884, the board organized in August,\r\nthat year had fifteen members. The board organized in August, 1885, had\r\nten members. This representation continued till the law of 1911 provided\r\nfor the reduction to six members, and for a term of four years instead\r\nof two years. The reduction was completed in 1913, and since August of\r\nthat year the board has had six members, elected without regard to city\r\nwards.\r\n\r\nThe presidents of the board from 1871 have been as follows: For the year\r\nending in May, 1872, H. S. Baker; J. T. Coplan, to May, 1873; J. K.\r\nFisher, to May, 1874; A. J. North, three years, to May, 1877; John\r\nSeaton, two years, to May, 1879; A. F. Martin, two and one-fourth years,\r\nto August, 1881; J. C. Fox, to August, 1882; John B. Kurth, to August,\r\n1883; J. C. Fox, to August, 1884; Seneca Heath, two years, to August,\r\n1886; E. A. Mize, five years, to August, 1891; R. C. Meade, to August,\r\n1892; J. T. Hersey, two years, to August, 1894; J. F. Woodhouse, to\r\nAugust, 1895; J. T. Allensworth, to August, 1896; W. L. Bailey, to\r\nAugust, 1897; Chas. S. Osborn, ten years, to August, 1907; H. H.\r\nHackney, eight years, to August, 1915; Alva Clapp, now serving his first\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWhile the records of the early days are not available, there are\r\nindications that the chaos of the early schools was reduced to order in\r\nthe middle sixties, the graded system unifying the free schools being\r\nestablished at that time by D. T. Bradford, who served as superintendent\r\nand principal of the high school for four years. In those early days the\r\nsuperintendent taught during the greater part of his time.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradford was followed by a Mr. Owens, who served one year and was\r\nfollowed by R. H. Jackson. Available records show that Mr. Jackson was\r\nsuperintendent in August, 1871, and served till June, 1876. How long he\r\nserved prior to the election of May, 1871, is not indicated by records\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nThe superintendents following Mr. Jackson are as follows: I. C. Scott,\r\nto 1878; C. S. Sheffield, to 1880; R. C. Meade, to December, 1886; F. M.\r\nDraper, to 1889; Buel T. Davis, to 1891; John H. Glorfelter, to 1901;\r\nNathan T. Veatch, serving at present (January, 1916).\r\n\r\nThe principals of the high school serving prior to the union of the\r\nduties of superintendent and principal of the high school were, P. D.\r\nPlattenburg, Orlando Sawyer and David Negley.\r\n\r\nThe course of study in the high school then was Latin, followed later by\r\nthe Latin-Scientific. Little change was made for years, except the\r\nintroduction of German in the fall of 1871. For more than thirty years\r\nthere was little change in the subject matter of the work. The most\r\nimportant change during those thirty years or more was the complete\r\norganization of the high school by Superintendent R. C. Meade, in 1880,\r\nat which time a distinct principal was placed in charge of the\r\nreorganized high school. The first principal under the new plan was F.\r\nW. Bartlett. Definite classes were started and the first class graduated\r\nJune 7, 1881, in Corinthian Hall, as follows: Jane Boone, Arthur\r\nChalliss, Blanche Challiss, Daisy, L. Denton, Della Estes, Mary E. Fox,\r\nFrances L. Garside, Lilly G. Hathaway. Maggie R. Hedges, May Hosier,\r\nVictor Linley, Nellie G. Reid, Mary E. Scott, Annie Underwood, 14. Total\r\ngraduates to date (January, 1916), 568.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “The Ingalls School,” Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\nF. W. Bartlett was principal of the high school until 1883. The\r\nfollowing is the list of principals since 1883: J. B. Cash, to 1883;\r\nGeo. D. Ostrom, to 1887; J.T. Dobell, to 1895; C. A. Shively, to 1900:\r\nW. C. Jamieson, to 1902; A. H. Speer, to 1909; W. H. Livers, to 1910; J.\r\nT. Rosson, to 1911 H. P. Shepherd, now serving his fifth year.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent and principal aided by one assistant taught the high\r\nschool subjects till 1882. With the opening of school in September, of\r\nthat year, the high school course of study was changed from two years to\r\na full three-years course. Miss Sarah E. Steele and Miss Anna M. Niklaus\r\nwere assistants during those early years.\r\n\r\nThe addition to the teaching force, the lengthened course and the\r\ntendency toward greater latitude in the choice of subjects soon doubled\r\nthe high school enrollment. The start toward vocational studies began in\r\nSeptember, 1881, when, at the suggestion of J. H. Garside, bookkeeping\r\nwas made an optional study.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the high school was gradual. During the late eighties,\r\nanother year was added to the course and an additional assistant was\r\nemployed. Manual training was added in December, 1903; sewing, 1907;\r\ncommercial subjects were added from time to time till the introduction\r\nof a full business course, including shorthand and typewriting, in 1910;\r\nnormal training, 1909; cooking, 1910; physical training, 1910;\r\nelementary agriculture, 1913; school nurse, January, 1914; special music\r\ndirector, 1915. The addition of courses and optional subjects has so\r\nincreased the high school work as to require eighteen teachers, in\r\naddition to the principal, and the enrollment has grown to 393. The\r\nschool is on the accredited list of the University of Kansas and of the\r\nNorth Central Association of Colleges. A school paper, the _Optimist_,\r\nis now in its sixth year. A Glee Club and orchestra have been organized.\r\nA Young Men’s Christian Association and a Young Women’s Christian\r\nAssociation are doing good work. The athletic association is giving an\r\noutlet for the surplus energy in football, basketball, etc.\r\n\r\nGrades and teachers were added in the different buildings until there\r\nare now (January, 1916) five buildings having full eight grades of work,\r\none building with three grades, and the Branchton school having two\r\ngrades. The Branchton building belongs to district 65. Manual training\r\nfor the boys and sewing for the girls are given in sixth, seventh and\r\neighth grades and high school. All the grades have the benefit of\r\ninspection by the school nurse, and instruction in music by the special\r\ndirector.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 the teaching force was thirty beside the superintendent. This\r\ngrew to forty-one by 1901, and to sixty-five in 1915.\r\n\r\nDuring March, 1881, it was resolved that a “kindergarten” be opened\r\nduring the next term. No record is found indicating the opening of such\r\nschool. The kindergarten was not made a part of the system till 1910.\r\nSuch work was offered earlier in rooms granted by the board. This was,\r\nhowever, the result of private enterprise.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the new high school building in 1910, the first public\r\nkindergarten was established. In the spring of 1914, another\r\nkindergarten was opened in the new Washington school.\r\n\r\nThe corner stone of the Central building was laid in August, 1868. This\r\nbuilding was destroyed by fire in October, 1869. The construction of a\r\nnew building on the old foundation began as soon as plans were\r\ncompleted. This was the three-story brick building, costing $35,000,\r\ntorn down in 1908, to make room for the magnificent high school building\r\ncompleted in 1910, and occupied for all school purposes in September of\r\nthat year. On October 5, 1892, the name was changed to “The Ingalls\r\nSchool.”\r\n\r\nThe building begun in 1869 and, when completed, said to be “one of the\r\nfinest in the State,” was opened in 1870 and served without change till\r\n1903, when a three-story addition, costing $5,264.00 was built to\r\nprovide for the office, manual training, one high school room and\r\nsanitary fixtures. It was finally outgrown after serving thirty-eight\r\nyears. While the present building was being constructed, the high school\r\nwas housed in the old three-story Douglas building, Fifth and R streets,\r\nand in two rooms of the old Washington building, Sixth and Q streets.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years’ waiting for the new Ingalls building the colored\r\npupils from Douglas school were housed in a vacant store at Sixth and\r\nSpring streets for one year, and in Lincoln school for part of the\r\nsecond year, and the grades of Ingalls school were housed as follows:\r\nSeventh and eighth, banquet room of Odd Fellows Hall; sixth, Martin\r\nschool; fifth, Pioneer Hall; second, third and fourth, basement of\r\nCongregational church; first, basement of Presbyterian church; manual\r\ntraining, in old fire department for the first year, and in a vacant\r\nstore room till the latter part of December of the second year, when it\r\nwas moved to the new building.\r\n\r\nThe present high school building, the Ingalls school, cost about\r\n$103,500. The equipment and added lots at the southwest corner of the\r\nblock, improvement of grounds, etc., will bring the present value of the\r\nproperty at least to $130,000.\r\n\r\nGovernor George W. Glick was largely instrumental in the work of\r\nsecuring the lots for the Ingalls school. The ten lots purchased prior\r\nto the erection of the first building cost, approximately, $3,500. Lots\r\n8 and 9 in the same block secured by condemnation in 1911, cost $2,250.\r\n\r\nThe three-story brick building at the corner of Fifth and R streets,\r\nbuilt in 1873 at a cost of $15,000, was originally called Washington\r\nschool. A three-room, one-story frame building, erected on this site in\r\nthe middle sixties, was the first building owned by district No. 1, and\r\nserved till 1873. The lots cost $1,200 and the building $2,425. At that\r\ntime a frame building at the corner of Sixth and Q streets was used by\r\nthe colored pupils and was called Douglas school. This was built in the\r\nmiddle sixties. It was at first a two-room, one-story building. Later, a\r\nthird room was added. The lots cost $820. This was the second building\r\nowned by district No. 1. Early maps of Atchison show the locations of\r\nWashington and Douglas here given.\r\n\r\nThe names “Central,” “Washington,” “Franklin,” “Lincoln” and “Douglas”\r\nwere authorized February 2, 1880.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 work began on two new buildings, one a ten-room brick building\r\nto take the place of the frame building called “Douglas,” and the other\r\nan eight-room brick building at Sixth and Division streets, named North\r\nAtchison school. The one at Sixth and Q streets cost $18,682, and was\r\noccupied for school purposes January 5, 1885. The white pupils in\r\n“Washington” school were taken to the new building, and the colored\r\nschool formerly housed in “Douglas” was taken to the “Washington.” The\r\nnames were also transferred soon after the new order of things was\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe ten-room Washington building was used till the close of school for\r\nvacation, December, 1913. On January 5, 1914, the school began work in\r\nthe present beautiful building, south of R street, between Fifth and\r\nSixth streets. The old property at Sixth and Q streets was sold for\r\n$2,300, but the name of the school was retained. The new building with\r\ngrounds and equipment cost $63,000. The site was secured by condemnation\r\nand cost $5,350.\r\n\r\nThe original “Washington” remained the “Douglas” until the completion of\r\nthe new Douglas on Sixth, between U and V streets. The pupils of\r\n“Douglas” were housed in “Lincoln” till late in the fall of 1909. The\r\nsite of this building, lots 18, 19, 20 and 21, block 35, South Atchison,\r\nwas secured in March, 1909, in exchange for lots 10 and 11, same block,\r\nthe old hospital property, which had previously been donated to the\r\nboard of education for school purposes, the money involved being the\r\npayment of some back taxes by the board.\r\n\r\nThe North Atchison school, Sixth and Division streets, was occupied for\r\nschool purposes in September, 1885. The lots cost $800 and the building,\r\nequipment and retaining walls, $5,381.94. On October 5, 1892, the name\r\nof this school was changed to “The John A. Martin School.” This building\r\nwas used till the last of May, 1915. Immediately after the close of\r\nschool, May 28, 1915, it was wrecked to make way for the new building\r\nnow in course of construction. The added ground, secured by\r\ncondemnation, cost $6,200 and the building, equipment and improvement of\r\ngrounds will cost, approximately, $56,500. During the year 1915–16 this\r\nschool is housed in the Ingalls building.\r\n\r\nThe West Atchison school building, named Franklin school, February 2,\r\n1880, was, originally, a three-room, one-story brick, costing $2,617.10.\r\nThis was changed to six rooms by the addition of a second story in 1883,\r\nat a cost of $2,498, and was remodeled and changed to an eight-room\r\nbuilding in 1908, at a cost of $12,500, and reoccupied early in 1909.\r\nThe lots cost $400. During the change in Franklin, the pupils were\r\nhoused in the “Green-Tree House” and in a vacant store room at 1521 Main\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nThe Lincoln school (colored), Eighth and Atchison streets, was\r\noriginally a three-room, one-story brick building erected in 1871 at a\r\ncost of $2,425. The lots cost $750. In 1883, this was changed to a six-\r\nroom building at a cost of $2,498. This is the only school building in\r\nthe city not modernized.\r\n\r\nThe records reveal some interesting things. In 1878 it was decided that\r\n“the work of the grades should be completed in eight years.” In 1884 an\r\nattempt was made to establish a branch high school in South Atchison.\r\nWhile this failed, it was voted that “a sub-junior grade be maintained\r\nin the Washington school.” This was discontinued within a few years.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1883, it was ordered that the schools close because of lack of\r\nfunds. The city council came to the rescue and appropriated $4,000 for\r\nschool purposes. The schools re-opened March 29.\r\n\r\nThe school year was shortened several times in those early days.\r\n\r\nThe school spirit is in splendid condition. The increased material\r\nequipment is adding greatly to the educational opportunities.\r\n“Continuation schools” have been conducted for several years, with good\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\nThe improvements have been made without bonds, excepting the $100,000\r\nissue for the high school in 1908. The total bonded indebtedness\r\n(January, 1916) is $122,000. Of this amount, $4,000 will be paid July 1,\r\n1916. Of the issue of 1908, $94,000 remain unpaid, and will fall due in\r\n1923. The $24,000 refunding bonds issued in 1913 will be due in 1933.\r\nThe board of education is not using the full limit of its taxing power.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to add a tribute at this point to the faithful,\r\nenthusiastic and efficient work rendered by Prof. Nathan T. Veatch to\r\nthe public school system of Atchison. During the period of his service\r\nhere, Atchison has seen its greatest development in its public school\r\nsystem, and this has not only been brought about by the fine public\r\nspirit that exists here but by the splendid co-operation which Prof.\r\nVeatch has given it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PRIVATE SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the private schools that existed here in an early day,\r\nthere were a number of private schools which did good work in Atchison\r\nsubsequently to the Teasdale school, which was operated here in the\r\neighties. Mrs. Harriet E. Monroe rendered the cause of education in\r\nAtchison county an invaluable and also an imperishable service. Mrs.\r\nMonroe founded the Atchison Institute. In 1871 she erected a building at\r\nthe northwest corner of Third and Kansas avenue, to which a wing was\r\nadded in 1876, and three years later the large brick building, all of\r\nwhich are still standing. The property represented an investment of\r\n$25,000, and the success of Mrs. Monroe’s enterprise was phenomenal. She\r\nreceived no bonus or assistance from city, county, State, church or\r\nindividual. She had nine students when she started her school, and\r\nsubsequently increased her enrollment to 300. She had a musical\r\ndepartment and an art department, and they were admitted to have no\r\nsuperior in the Missouri valley at that time. She also conducted a\r\nkindergarten, primary, intermediate and academic grades. Also a\r\ncollegiate department, consisting of preparatory, scientific, classical\r\nand literary courses, together with the normal and commercial courses.\r\nShe had thirteen teachers. Her vocational department covered all the\r\narts of domestic economy and domestic science, before which she employed\r\nmost eminent women in their special lines to deliver lectures. Mrs.\r\nMonroe was then, and is now, a truly remarkable woman. Her school was a\r\nforerunner of Midland College, and when it came to Atchison in 1887,\r\nMrs. Monroe closed her school shortly thereafter and has since been a\r\nresident of Washington, D. C. She is a highly educated lady of\r\nrefinement and culture, and has spent much time upon the lecture\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Monroe Institute, some years later, Prof. Flint conducted\r\na Latin school here, which was largely attended. Mr. Flint was succeeded\r\nby Prof. Foot, and as an outgrowth of these two schools, Misses Helen\r\nand Abigail Scofield opened a preparatory school, and successfully\r\nconducted it for a number of years, when they were succeeded by Miss\r\nMary Walton, who ran her school in the building owned by Mrs. J. W.\r\nParker, on Laramie street, between Third and Fourth streets, until a few\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the public school system is augmented in its work by several\r\nparochial and denominational schools, conducted by the Catholics and the\r\nGerman Lutherans.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MT. ST. SCHOLASTICA’S ACADEMY.\r\n\r\nOne of the first sights to impress the visitor to Atchison is the\r\nimposing collection of buildings which crowns its southern hill, now\r\ncommonly known as Mt. St. Scholastica.\r\n\r\nMt. St. Scholastica is practically as old as Atchison itself, the first\r\nsisters having come here in 1863. Few who gaze upon the massive and\r\ncommodious array of buildings, surrounded as they now are by well-kept\r\nlawns, spacious meadow and woodland, stop to think of its humble\r\nbeginning and the many trials which beset the early foundation. But the\r\nfirst sisters were in time to feel the effects of the Civil war and the\r\nhardships attendant upon the same.\r\n\r\nAt the request of Rev. Augustine Wirth, O. S. B., then prior of St.\r\nBenedict’s College, and the first pastor of the church in Atchison, Rev.\r\nMother Evangelista and six companions were sent from the Benedictine\r\nconvent in St. Cloud, Minn., to establish a school in Atchison. Two more\r\nsisters were sent the following April. As these latter were on their\r\nway, they were detained at Hannibal for two days. The funeral cortege of\r\nPresident Lincoln having reached that city at the same time as the\r\nsisters, one of their sad privileges was that of attending the obsequies\r\nof the martyred President before continuing their journey Kansasward.\r\n\r\nThe little convent, situated at the corner of Second and Division\r\nstreets, near St. Benedict’s church, was the cradle of the present\r\ninstitution. Second street at that time was not a street at all, but\r\nrather a passageway cut through the hazel brush, then so abundant in\r\nAtchison.\r\n\r\nThe academy organized its classes December 1, 1863. It was incorporated\r\nin 1873. Its roster bears the names of many of Atchison’s best families\r\nof both town and county.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1877 the Price villa was purchased. A new building was\r\nadded in 1889. The third building was commenced in 1900. The buildings\r\nare surrounded by thirty-eight acres of woodland and meadow.\r\n\r\nBesides the academy in Atchison, the sisters supply teachers for a large\r\nnumber of missions or parochial schools in Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri,\r\nand Iowa, also one large school in Walsenburg, Colo. The institution in\r\nAtchison is the center or mother house of all these branch houses, and\r\nin vacation all the sisters from the missions assemble here for the\r\nannual retreat, and for the summer normal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mt. St. Scholastica’s Academy, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe venerable Mother Evangelista, the first mother and foundress, was\r\nsucceeded in office by Sister Theresa, who governed the community as\r\nReverend mother for the next twelve years. Since that time Mother\r\nAloysia has ably carried on the work of her predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe early days of Mt. St. Scholastica, like the early days of Kansas,\r\nwere times of struggle and hardships. Yet, these brave pioneer sisters\r\nwere of the true Kansas type, and tell us that they never for a moment\r\nregretted their mission to the Sunflower State. They tell us, too, that\r\nthe sunflower itself had a strange power to cheer and encourage their\r\nearly days. Its sturdy stalk and bright disk seem so fit a type of\r\nfaith, labor and grateful content, that, even to the present day this\r\nrustic flower always finds a place in the convent garden.\r\n\r\nThe later history of Mt. St. Scholastica is too well known to need\r\nrepetition. Its actual growth began with the purchase of Price villa in\r\n1877, since which time progress has been steady and vigorous.\r\n\r\nA most comprehensive plan of study is pursued at Mt. St. Scholastica. It\r\nincludes all branches needful for a thorough, literal and refined\r\neducation, the outcome of long years of experience and thoughtful\r\nconsideration. That this fact is appreciated, not only by neighboring\r\ncities and towns, may be seen by consulting the academy roster, which\r\nrecords a long list of names from many and various sections of the\r\ncountry. Besides the academic or classical course, Mt. St. Scholastica\r\nfurnishes a complete commercial course, together with special advantages\r\nfor the study of music and art.\r\n\r\nThe home life of Mt. St. Scholastica is ideal. The association of\r\nfellow-students amid wholesome environments has the tendency to bring\r\nout and develop every noble and womanly quality, while the beneficient\r\nand judicious guidance of the sisters wisely leads to the attainment of\r\nthose lofty principles so needful to right living.\r\n\r\nSacred Heart parochial school, in Atchison, is also controlled by the\r\nBenedictine sisters, and is supported by tuition. Its curriculum extends\r\nthrough the grades, and the school is under the direction of Sister\r\nMonica, O. S. B., and one assistant. Both boys and girls attend, and the\r\nenrollment in 1916 is seventy-four.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis College is another parochial school, offering work through the\r\ngrades, and admitting both boys and girls. It is maintained by St.\r\nBenedict’s parish. Number of teachers employed is six, and the Rev.\r\nGerard Heinz, O. S. B., is principal. Enrollment in 1916 is 293.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick’s parochial school is located near St. Patrick’s church, in\r\nUnion District No. 2, about seven miles south of Atchison. Two teachers\r\nare employed in the school, and Ven. Sr. Merwina, O. S. B., is\r\ndirectress. It is controlled and supported by St. Patrick’s parish, and\r\nits curriculum extends through the grades. Boys and girls attend the\r\nschool, and the enrollment in 1916 was sixty-seven.\r\n\r\nSt. Ann’s school is a Catholic parochial school, at Effingham. It is\r\ncontrolled and supported by St. Ann’s parish. Both boys and girls enroll\r\nin the school, which completes the work of the grades. The past year,\r\nforty-six pupils were in attendance. Two teachers are employed, one of\r\nwhom is Sister Sr. M. Marcellina, O. S. B., the directress.\r\n\r\nThe Trinity Lutheran parochial school is controlled and supported by the\r\nTrinity Lutheran parish, corner of Eighth and Laramie streets. The\r\ncurriculum extends to the eighth grade, and work is offered to both boys\r\nand girls. The enrollment in 1916 is fifty-three, and Rev. Carl W.\r\nGreinki is principal.\r\n\r\n\r\n           MIDLAND COLLEGE AND WESTERN THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY.\r\n\r\nThe board of education of the general synod of the Evangelical Lutheran\r\nchurch, after considering propositions from a number of cities in the\r\nMiddle West, decided on Atchison as the most suitable location for a\r\nLutheran institution. It is easy of access from the whole territory from\r\nwhich students are most likely to come, and the offer of the city to\r\ngive $50,000 in money for buildings, twenty acres of land for a campus\r\nand professors’ houses, a half interest in the sale of 500 acres of\r\nland, and to furnish 200 students the first year, was a tempting offer.\r\n\r\nOwing to some difficulties that arose, this offer was not entirely\r\nfulfilled, but the twenty acres of ground was donated, and about $33,000\r\nput into buildings. The college was opened on the fifteenth of\r\nSeptember, 1887, with 101 students registered.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the main building, known as Atchison Hall, was begun, and turned\r\nover to the board of trustees in the spring of 1889, and formally\r\ndedicated on the 30th day of September of the same year. The institution\r\nwas given over to the care of a self-perpetuating board. From time to\r\ntime the constitution has been changed, so that the trustees would be\r\nelected by the synods supporting the college.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the board is composed of twenty-nine members; four\r\nare elected by the board from the citizens of Atchison, six from each of\r\nthe Kansas, English Nebraska and German Nebraska synods; two from the\r\nRocky Mountain and Iowa synods each, and three from the Alumni\r\nAssociation, with the president of the college advisory member, ex-\r\nofficio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Carnegie Library, Atchison, Kansas\r\n]\r\n\r\nRev. Jacob A. Clutz, D. D., was elected first president, and served\r\nefficiently in that capacity for fourteen and one-half years. In 1904\r\nRev. M. F. Troxell, D. D., pastor of the English Lutheran church of St.\r\nJoseph, Mo. was elected president, and was succeeded by Dr. Rufus B.\r\nPeery.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Oak Hall, a dormitory for girls, was erected, to which, about\r\nten years later, the annex was added, giving accommodations for thirty\r\nyoung women. In 1893 the gymnasium was erected, the money being\r\nsolicited by the students of the institution. Through the solicitations\r\nof Dr. Clutz, a splendid six-inch telescope was donated, and an\r\nobservatory built in 1899. Through the efforts of Dr. Troxell a\r\nproposition was secured from Andrew Carnegie to donate $15,000 towards\r\nthe building of a library, provided the same amount could be raised for\r\nits upkeep. From the synods on the territory, alumni and friends of the\r\ncollege, this amount was secured, and the handsome library building was\r\nerected during the winter of 1910–1911, and formally dedicated on May\r\n30, 1911. A legacy of $5,000, given several years before, was added to\r\nthe building fund in order to have a public hall, and a memorial tablet\r\nwas placed in the hall to the memory of the generous donor, Rev. J. G.\r\nGriffith, D. D. On the retirement of Dr. Clutz, his home was bought by\r\nthe college board for the use of the president.\r\n\r\nThe Western Theological Seminary was organized in 1895, and the first\r\npresident and professor, Rev. F. D. Altman, D. D., was inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThe German department of the seminary was added a few years later, with\r\nDr. J. L. Neve as dean of the department. The home owned by ex-Senator\r\nJohn J. Ingalls was secured in 1908 for seminary purposes. It is\r\nadmirably adapted to that purpose. At the annual meeting of the college\r\ntrustees in 1910 the board of education turned over the management of\r\nthe seminary to this board.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. BENEDICT’S COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nSt. Benedict’s College is the product of Benedictine activity in Kansas,\r\nin the cause of Christian civilization. Father Boniface Wimmer, O. S.\r\nB., the founder of the Benedictines in the United States, settled in\r\nPennsylvania in 1846, and ten years later he sent missionaries in all\r\ndirections, and where they settled, promptly there, too, their schools\r\nsoon were founded. Father Henry Lempe, O. S. B., was the first\r\nBenedictine to touch upon Kansas soil in 1856, and he inspired Bishop\r\nMiege, S. J., of Leavenworth, with the idea of inviting Abbott Wimmer to\r\nmake a foundation in Kansas, and thereafter Father Augustine Wirth, O.\r\nS. B., was sent out to Doniphan, in 1857, but in 1858 he moved to\r\nAtchison. Father Augustine’s management of the college continued until\r\n1868, when he was succeeded by Louis M. Fink, O. S. B., who remained at\r\nthe head of the institution until 1871. It was under Father Louis that\r\nthe first printed catalog of St. Benedict’s College appears. Father\r\nGiles Christoph, O. S. B., succeeded Father Louis, and held the position\r\nthree years, from 1871 to 1874, and was succeeded by Father Oswald\r\nMoosmueller, O. S. B. The college is situated on the hills north of\r\nAtchison and commands an extensive view of the Missouri river and\r\nsurrounding country. In 1908 the college planned to erect a new group of\r\nbuildings to crown the brow of the hill, east of the old college, new\r\nSt. Benedict is to be not only first class, but it is to be a monument\r\nof beautiful architecture, which will be in Tudor Gothic and uniform\r\nthroughout. The administration building, already erected, comprises the\r\nfirst of the group, part of which comprises living quarters of the\r\nstudents. It is a fire-proof building of re-inforced concrete and\r\nvitrified brick, spacious, well ventilated, and conveniently arranged.\r\nThe buildings in the old group are of substantial structure, well fitted\r\nto serve their purposes. They comprise an auditorium, recitation room,\r\nkitchen and dining rooms, scientific laboratories, museum of natural\r\nhistory, music and typewriting departments. The college has two distinct\r\nlibraries, one for the exclusive use of the students, and the other, the\r\ncollege library proper. The students’ library contains upwards of 5,000\r\nvolumes, in addition to a number of papers and magazines. The college\r\nlibrary proper, maintained for the use of the professors, occupies four\r\nrooms and the monastery, and it contains more than 27,400 bound volumes\r\nand over 5,000 pamphlets. The scientific laboratories are adequate for\r\npresent use, and the museum is one of the best of its kind in this part\r\nof the country. The playgrounds of the college are large and well suited\r\nto afford all manner of healthful exercise for the students.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  St. Benedict’s College, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe courses available in the college are the academic, the collegiate,\r\nbusiness and stenographic, which are presided over by twenty-two\r\nprofessors, and in which are 300 students. St. Benedict’s is one of the\r\nfinest Catholic institutions in the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n                             BENCH AND BAR.\r\n\r\n  EARLY MECCA OF LEGAL TALENT—ORGANIZATION OF JUDICIAL DISTRICT—EARLY\r\n      JUDGES—PROMINENT PIONEER LAWYERS—MEMBERS OF THE ATCHISON COUNTY\r\n      BAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtchison county has always been particularly proud of the high order of\r\ntalent that has graced its bench and bar. From the very earliest days of\r\nits history, the legal profession has been well represented here. Men\r\nwho have reached a high order of distinction in the profession have had\r\ntheir beginning at the bar of this county. In fact, this county has been\r\nsomewhat unique in this respect, for there is perhaps no other county in\r\nKansas that has furnished a greater number of distinguished\r\nrepresentatives of this noble profession, who have shed their luster\r\nupon the fair name of the State. For a long period, indeed, Atchison\r\nseemed to be the Mecca towards which the best legal talent from all\r\nquarters of the country gathered, and it was the Atchison bar that\r\nfurnished three chief justices of the supreme court of Kansas, one\r\nUnited States district judge, an attorney-general, a governor, a United\r\nStates senator, and a general counsel for a large railroad system.\r\n\r\nNo attempt will be made in this chapter to give a complete roster of\r\nnames of the many lawyers who have successfully practiced their\r\nprofession here. The list is too numerous, but reference will be made to\r\na number of conspicuous leaders, whose names stand out prominently in\r\nthe history of the State, and whose careers have enriched the story of\r\nsuccess and achievement.\r\n\r\nAtchison county was one of the counties of the second judicial district,\r\nwhich composed, in addition to Atchison county, Doniphan, Brown, Nemaha,\r\nMarshall and Washington counties. The first judge of the district was\r\nHon. Albert L. Lee, who lived at Elwood, Doniphan county, and served\r\nfrom January 29 to October 31, 1861. He died in New York City December\r\n31, 1907. The second judge of this district was Hon. Albert H. Horton.\r\nJudge Horton was born in Orange county, New York, March 12, 1837, and\r\nwas educated at Farmers’ Hall Academy, in that county, and at Ann Arbor\r\nUniversity. He was admitted to practice in the supreme court of New\r\nYork, at Brooklyn, in 1859, and continued the practice of his profession\r\nat Goshen until 1860, when he removed to Kansas, locating at Atchison.\r\nHis first public office here was city attorney, to which place he was\r\nelected in the spring of 1861, upon the Republican ticket, and the same\r\nyear was appointed by Governor Robinson judge of the second judicial\r\ndistrict, and held this office, by election, until 1866, when he\r\nresigned. He was a Republican presidential elector in 1868, and in 1869\r\nwas appointed a district attorney of Kansas by President Grant, which\r\noffice he held until 1873, when he was elected a member of the house of\r\nrepresentatives from this county. Three years later he was elected to\r\nthe State senate, and was also a delegate to the National Republican\r\nconvention in June of that year, and in the same year was appointed\r\nchief justice of the supreme court of Kansas by Governor Thomas A.\r\nOsborn, to succeed Hon. S. A. Kingman, who was before that time a\r\nprominent practitioner in Atchison. In 1877 Judge Horton was nominated\r\non the Republican ticket to the office of chief justice of the State,\r\nand he served in that capacity for seventeen years, at the end of which\r\ntime he returned to Atchison and formed a partnership with Hon. B. P.\r\nWaggener. Judge Horton was an able jurist and lawyer, a strong\r\nargumentative and fluent speaker. He displayed marked ability as a\r\nparliamentarian while in the legislature, and was, altogether, a man of\r\nstrong mental capacity, good judgment, coupled with executive ability,\r\nand much practical experience. After a number of years’ practice here,\r\nfollowing his resignation as chief justice of the State, he subsequently\r\nwas reëlected to the same position. He died on the second day of\r\nSeptember, 1902.\r\n\r\nJudge Horton was succeeded as judge of the district court of this\r\ndistrict by Hon. St. Clair Graham May 11, 1866. Judge Graham served as\r\nJudge until January 11, 1869, and was on the bench at the time that the\r\ncelebrated Regis Liosel land contest was tried in Nemaha county, in\r\nwhich John J. Ingalls, another Atchison lawyer, represented some\r\nclaimants to 38,111 acres of land in the counties of Nemaha, Marshall,\r\nJackson and Pottawatomie. It was one of the celebrated cases of that\r\nday. The litigation grew out of a French land grant, which subsequently\r\nwas confirmed by an act of Congress in 1858.\r\n\r\nJudge Graham was succeeded by Hon. Nathan Price, of Troy, Doniphan\r\ncounty, January 11, 1869. Judge Price served until March 1, 1872. He\r\npracticed law in the district for a number of years thereafter, and died\r\nin Troy March 8, 1883. B. P. Waggener, who began his wonderful career as\r\na lawyer during the administration of Judge Price, and who has been in\r\nthe active practice in Atchison since that time, is authority for the\r\nstatement that Judge Price was one of the most brilliant judges that\r\never adorned the bench. He is described by Mr. Waggener as being a man\r\nof a powerful personality, and thoroughly grounded in the principles of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  S. C. KINGMAN\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  P. T. ABELL\r\n]\r\n\r\nDuring this period in the history of the county, Atchison had one of the\r\nstrongest bars in the State of Kansas. Among the able lawyers then in\r\nthe active practice were: P. T. Abell, about whom much has appeared in\r\nthis history; Gen. Benjamin F. Stringfellow, Alfred G. Otis, John J.\r\nIngalls, George W. Glick, Samuel C. Kingman, J. T. Hereford, Gen. W. W.\r\nGuthrie, Albert H. Horton, Cassius G. Foster, S. H. Glenn, F. D. Mills\r\nand David Martin, and one of that number, Mr. Waggener, is also\r\nauthority for the statement that Benjamin F. Stringfellow was the most\r\nbrilliant. General Stringfellow was a brother of Dr. John H.\r\nStringfellow, one of the founders of Atchison, and, like his brother,\r\nwas a strong pro-slavery leader. He was famous before he came to\r\nAtchison, because of his widely known views with regard to the opening\r\nof Kansas as a slave State, and for the depth and force of his arguments\r\nupon the points then at issue. General Stringfellow was born in\r\nFredericksburg, Va., September 3, 1816, and before coming to Kansas he\r\nwas a resident of Missouri. He first located in Louisville, Ky., and\r\nthen went to St. Louis, and from St. Louis to Huntsville, Mo., finally\r\nlocating at Keytesville, where he settled down in his profession, and\r\nwas recognized as being a young lawyer of fine ability. He declined the\r\nposition of circuit attorney, but upon the earnest solicitation of the\r\ngovernor, he finally yielded and entered upon the duties of that office,\r\nand subsequently was elected without opposition, and held that office\r\nfor a term of four years at a salary of $250 a year. He subsequently was\r\nelected to the legislature, with the largest majority ever received in a\r\ncounty, and immediately became a very active, popular and influential\r\nmember of that body. Shortly thereafter the position of attorney-general\r\nof the State of Missouri became vacant, and General Stringfellow was\r\nappointed to that place. He held the office of attorney-general for four\r\nyears. It was then that he formed a partnership with Hon. P. T. Abell,\r\nwhich continued until the fall of 1851, and they removed to Weston,\r\nPlatte county, Missouri, in the fall of 1853.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of Kansas to settlement in 1854, General Stringfellow\r\nfound the abolitionists preparing to get control of the country, and, in\r\nopposition to the formation of the Massachusetts Immigrants’ Aid\r\nSociety, he took part in the organization of a pro-slavery organization\r\nat Weston, Mo., known as the Platte County Self-Defensive Association,\r\nof which he was secretary, and one of its most active members. General\r\nStringfellow, foreseeing the conflict, insisted that the only means of\r\npreventing or deferring it, was to make Kansas a slave State, and thus\r\nretain sufficient power in the United States Senate to defeat aggression\r\nby the abolitionists on the rights of the South. General Stringfellow,\r\nwith all the power and enthusiasm of his southern temperament, labored\r\nceaselessly for the success of his cause. He was the active man of what\r\nwas generally called “Atchison, Stringfellow & Company.”\r\n\r\nWhen the pro-slavery forces finally succeeded, and the destiny of Kansas\r\nwas fixed, General Stringfellow went to Memphis, Tenn., in 1858, but not\r\nliking the climate, and compelled by his financial interests to look\r\nafter property in Atchison, he brought his family here and became a\r\nresident of Atchison county in the fall of 1859, and remained here\r\nduring all the bitter conflict that followed, beloved and respected by\r\nfriends and opponents alike. He submitted gracefully to the final\r\ndecision, and, while never seeking office, and influenced in his\r\npolitical action by what he deemed the best interests of the people of\r\nthe State, he cordially coöperated with the Republican party in Kansas,\r\nbut he was preëminently a lawyer, although he had a large outside\r\nbusiness interests during his residence here. He was active in the\r\norganization and construction of the Atchison & St. Joseph railroad,\r\nwhich was the first railroad connecting Kansas with the East, and was\r\nits first attorney. Shortly before his death he made a trip around the\r\nworld. He died in Chicago in the early nineties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GEN. B. F. STRINGFELLOW\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COL. J. A. MARTIN\r\n]\r\n\r\nA few years after General Stringfellow immigrated from Missouri into\r\nKansas, there came another famous lawyer, who was also formerly an\r\nattorney-general of Missouri, Gen. Bela M. Hughes. General Hughes was\r\nalso one of the brilliant lawyers of an early day, who remained in\r\nAtchison but a few years as general counsel for the Overland Stage Line.\r\nBefore coming to Atchison, General Hughes was a resident of St. Joseph,\r\nwhere he was the president and general counsel for the Central Overland\r\nCalifornia & Pike’s Peak Express Company. When this line was sold, under\r\na mortgage foreclosure, to Ben Holladay, in 1862, General Hughes came to\r\nAtchison. He served as general counsel for Mr. Holladay until the line\r\nwas purchased by Wells, Fargo & Company. He was retained by this company\r\nas its general counsel, which continued to operate the overland stage\r\nline, until a railroad was built across the plains, meanwhile moving to\r\nDenver, where he was elected the first president and general counsel of\r\nthe Denver & Pacific railway, the first railroad to enter Denver, in\r\nJuly, 1870, and he later became general counsel for the Denver & South\r\nPark railroad, and a member of the last territorial legislature of\r\nColorado. General Hughes was born in Kentucky, educated at Augusta\r\nCollege, and removed with his parents at an early date to Liberty, Mo.\r\nHe was a member of the Missouri legislature, prosecuting attorney, and\r\nreceiver of the United States land office at Plattsburg, from which\r\nplace he went to St. Joseph. In his early youth he was a soldier in the\r\nBlack Hawk war, serving with the Missouri volunteers. He took up his\r\nresidence in Denver in the late sixties, when the city had less than\r\n5,000 inhabitants. He died in Denver in 1904, at the age of eighty-six\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nJudge Samuel C. Kingman was born in Worthington, Mass., June 6, 1818. He\r\nattended a common school and academies of his home town, and became\r\nproficient in higher mathematics and Latin, but his regular attendance\r\nat school ended when he was seventeen years old. He was always a sickly\r\nman, and at times during his life was compelled to lay aside all study\r\nand attention to active affairs. At the age of twenty he drifted to\r\nKentucky, where he remained eighteen years, teaching school, reading law\r\nand practicing as an attorney. He held offices as county clerk and\r\ncounty attorney in Kentucky, and was a member of the legislature of that\r\nState in 1850. In 1856 he came to Iowa, and in the following year moved\r\nto Brown county, Kansas, where he lived on a farm for a year, and then\r\nopened a law office in Hiawatha. Judge Kingman was a member of the\r\nWyandotte Constitutional convention, which framed the constitution of\r\nthe State, and the same year was elected a judge of the supreme court,\r\ntaking his seat upon the admission of the State into the Union in 1861,\r\nholding his office for four years. In 1866 he was elected chief justice,\r\nand reëlected in 1872, but because of ill health he resigned in 1877,\r\nand retired from active professional life. Judge Kingman was for a time\r\na resident of Atchison and a law partner of John J. Ingalls. He died in\r\nTopeka September 9, 1904.\r\n\r\nCassius G. Foster, another one of the brilliant galaxy of lawyers, who\r\npracticed in Atchison during the term of Judge Price on the bench, was\r\nborn at Webster, Monroe county, New York, June 22, 1837. He was brought\r\nup on a farm until he was fourteen years of age, and having only the\r\nadvantages of a common district school, he attended high school at\r\nPalmyra, N. Y., after which he went to Michigan, where he lived on a\r\nfarm near Adrian, where he worked for his uncle. Meanwhile, he attended\r\nschool at the academy in Adrian. He studied law with Fernando C. Beaman,\r\nof Adrian, and afterwards removed to Rochester, N. Y. In June, 1859, he\r\ncame to Kansas, having previously been greatly interested in the Free\r\nState struggle, and upon arriving in Atchison, he formed a partnership\r\nwith Judge S. H. Glenn, and immediately won for himself a high position\r\nat the bar of the State and Federal courts. He was elected State senator\r\nfrom Atchison county in 1862, and was mayor of Atchison in 1867. He\r\npracticed law here until 1874, when he was appointed United States\r\ndistrict judge of Kansas.\r\n\r\nHon. P. L. Hubbard, of Atchison, succeeded Judge Price on the bench\r\nMarch 2, 1872, and served until January 8, 1877, and following Judge\r\nHubbard, Hon. Alfred G. Otis was elected judge of the second judicial\r\ndistrict January 8, 1877, and served until January, 1881. Judge Otis was\r\nborn in Cortland county, New York, December 13, 1828, and came to Kansas\r\nin October, 1855, and immediately became engaged in land litigation,\r\nwhich at that time was very active here. During the early career of\r\nJudge Otis in Atchison county, and for many years thereafter, land\r\nlitigation was the chief source of revenue for lawyers. There were no\r\ngreat corporations then as now; no railroads for clients, and aside from\r\nland litigation and a general practice of the law, including criminal\r\ncases, there was but little business for lawyers. At that time the\r\ncriminal practice was not looked upon with the same disapprobation on\r\nthe part of the profession as it is in these days. A good criminal\r\nlawyer then was an ornament to the profession, and a good criminal\r\nadvocate was in constant demand and his services brought him large\r\nremuneration. Judge Otis was a Democrat, but a Union man, and in\r\naddition to his activities in his profession, he was also prominent in\r\nthe business affairs of the town, and for a long time took an active\r\npart in the management of the Atchison Savings Bank, of which he was for\r\nmany years president. Judge Otis died in Atchison May 7, 1912.\r\n\r\nJudge Otis was succeeded by Hon. David Martin in January, 1881. Judge\r\nMartin served until April, 1887, and was one of the eminent members of\r\nthe Atchison county bar. In personal appearance he was unique among his\r\nfellows, and in physical appearance was the counterpart of Dickens’\r\nfamous Mr. Pickwick. He was a partner of B. P. Waggener for a number of\r\nyears, and was subsequently elected to the position of chief justice of\r\nthe supreme court of Kansas, where he served with great distinction. He\r\nwas a thorough lawyer and a scholar. He died at Atchison March 2, 1901.\r\n\r\nIt was between the terms of Judge Price and Judge David Martin that the\r\nbar of Atchison county reached its greatest eminence, and, while there\r\nhave been good lawyers here since that time, there never has been a\r\nperiod in the history of the county when there were so many brilliant\r\npractitioners at the bar. During several years following Judge Martin,\r\nthe second judicial district, which constituted Atchison county alone,\r\nwas torn by internal dissension, and upon the resignation of Judge\r\nMartin, Hon. H. M. Jackson was elected to the bench, April 1, 1887, and\r\nserved until January, 1888. There never was a more conscientious or\r\npainstaking lawyer a resident of Atchison than Judge Jackson. He was not\r\nonly a fine lawyer, but he was a good citizen, useful to clients and the\r\npublic alike. At his death, May 7, 1912, he left a large practice, which\r\nhas since been conducted by his son, Z. E. Jackson. Following a bitter\r\ncontest, Hon. W. D. Gilbert succeeded Judge Jackson in January, 1888,\r\nand served until 1889, and then came Hon. Robert N. Eaton, whose term\r\nbegan in January, 1889, and ended in January, 1893. Judge Eaton was\r\nsucceeded by Hon. W. D. Webb, who in turn was succeeded by Hon. W. T.\r\nBland, who served from January, 1897, to January, 1902, and resigned to\r\ngo into the wholesale drug business. Hon. Benjamin F. Hudson, one of the\r\noldest practitioners at the bar, succeeded Judge Bland and served until\r\nOctober 11, 1909, and was succeeded by Hon. William A. Jackson, the\r\npresent judge, a sketch of whose career appears in another part of this\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nDuring the turbulent years that followed the organization of the second\r\njudicial district, down to 1916, there was no greater lawyer at the\r\nAtchison county bar than B. P. Waggener, about whom there appears an\r\nhistorical sketch in another part of this history. Mr. Waggener, in\r\naddition to being a native genius, inherited or acquired a faculty for\r\nunremitting toil. These qualifications make him stand out in 1916 as a\r\nbrilliant leader of his profession in Atchison county. He has been\r\nassociated as a partner with many men who have been preëminent in their\r\nprofession at different periods in his career, Horton, Martin and\r\nDoster, all of whom served as chief justices of the State, were his\r\npartners, and in addition to these, Aaron S. Everest was at one time a\r\npartner under the firm name of Everest & Waggener. In January, 1876,\r\nthis firm was appointed general attorneys for northern Kansas of the\r\nMissouri Pacific and the Central Branch railroads, and from that date to\r\n1916 Mr. Waggener has been in the constant service of this road, first\r\nas general attorney and later as general counsel for the states of\r\nKansas, Nebraska and Colorado.\r\n\r\nCol. Aaron S. Everest was an interesting member of this bar. He was a\r\nnative of Plattsburg, N. Y., and located in Kansas in 1871. His first\r\npartner was A. G. Otis, and when he and Mr. Waggener were associated,\r\nthey were not only attorneys for the Missouri Pacific Railway Company,\r\nbut for the Pacific Express Company, the Western Union Telegraph\r\nCompany, three Atchison banks, the Atchison Bridge Company, and the firm\r\nwas also connected with the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Mr. Everest\r\nretired from active practice a number of years before his death, having\r\nacquired a comfortable fortune in the practice of law and in business\r\noperations. He died in St. Louis a number of years ago.\r\n\r\nThe present membership of the Atchison county bar is composed of lawyers\r\nof fine abilities, and the active members are as follows: James W. Orr,\r\nfor many years a partner of Mr. Waggener, and now special counsel for\r\nthe Government in important litigation against the Central Pacific\r\nrailroad; W. P. Waggener, general attorney for the Missouri Pacific\r\nRailway Company in Kansas; J. M. Challiss, former county attorney, and a\r\nmember of the firm of Waggener, Challiss & Crane, of which A. E. Crane\r\nis the other member; W. A. Jackson, district judge; Charles J. Conlon,\r\ncounty attorney, C. D. Walker and T. A. Moxcey, both of whom were former\r\ncounty attorneys; W. E. Brown, city attorney; Z. E. Jackson, of the firm\r\nof Jackson & Jackson; Judge J. L. Berry. P. Hayes, Hugo Orlopp, E. W.\r\nClausen, Ralph U. Pfouts, Charles T. Gundy, judge of the city court,\r\nGeorge L. Brown, William Q. Cain, and Andrew Deduall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n                          MEDICAL PROFESSION.\r\n\r\n  FIRST PHYSICIANS—EARLY PRACTICE—PIONEER REMEDIES—MODERN MEDICINE AND\r\n      SURGERY—PROMINENT PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS—ATCHISON COUNTY MEDICAL\r\n      SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny history of this county would be incomplete did it not dwell at some\r\nlength upon the activities of the splendid service rendered the\r\ncommunity by the physicians and surgeons who were among the earliest\r\narrivals upon the frontier, and have presided at the births and\r\nadministered to the sick and dying for the past sixty years.\r\n\r\nIt was peculiarly fitting and appropriate when Atchison was born, that a\r\nprominent physician of those days was on hand to assist in the delivery.\r\nIn truth, Dr. J. H. Stringfellow was not only the physician in charge,\r\nbut he also was one of the parents, and from that time to the present\r\nthe medical profession has been active in the affairs of the county.\r\nThere have been many splendid representatives of the profession here\r\nsince the days of Dr. Stringfellow, and the vicissitudes and trials and\r\nhardships they went through make up a romantic chapter in our history.\r\nThe oldest physician in the city of Atchison in 1916 in point of service\r\nis Dr. E. T. Shelly, and it might be said, without disparagement to\r\nothers, he is not only the oldest, but he is perhaps held in as high\r\nesteem and respect as any other physician who ever practiced here. Dr.\r\nShelly combines the qualities that make for good citizenship. He treats\r\nhis profession as a good Christian treats his religion. He is a man of\r\nideals, of vision, of integrity, and his life rings true. Yet, withal,\r\nDr. Shelly is not a professional hermit. While his profession comes\r\nfirst, he does not allow it to exclude him from an active interest and\r\nparticipation in the affairs of life. He is a student of political and\r\neconomic questions, an essayist, and a vigorous advocate of a liberal\r\ndemocracy. His views on these questions are wholesome and instructive,\r\nbut it is to the profession of medicine that Dr. Shelly addressed\r\nhimself in a recent interview the author of this history had with him,\r\nand his views were expressed as follows:\r\n\r\n“What changes have occurred in the practice of medicine since the days\r\nof the first physicians here! He did his work on horseback with his\r\nmedicines in saddle-bags thrown over the horse, and often had to go many\r\nmiles to visit a patient over a sparsely settled prairie with roads that\r\nwere little more than trails. The streams he had to cross were\r\nbridgeless, and the larger ones could be crossed only at fords, which,\r\nafter heavy rains or during freezing weather, were very dangerous.\r\n\r\n“Today, in this section of the State, these primitive conditions can\r\nhardly be imagined. Nearly every country doctor now has an automobile,\r\nand crosses gullies and streams on concrete bridges and travels over\r\n‘dragged’ roads. Instead of passing through a sparsely settled country,\r\nhe finds a fine large farm house on nearly every ‘quarter’ or ‘eighty’\r\nsupplemented by a substantial barn and spacious granaries. He passes a\r\nschool house every few miles and occasionally a rural church, and lives\r\nin a comfortable, modern home in a flourishing, well kept country town.\r\n\r\n“In the science and art of medicine the change has been no less marked\r\nthan in its general practice.\r\n\r\n“Until forty years ago, doctors possessed a few great remedies which\r\nthey often used very skillfully, but the knowledge of the nature of\r\ndisease was very slight. Treatment was largely symptomatic; that is,\r\nremedies were expected chiefly to combat certain symptoms, rather than\r\nto treat underlying causes.\r\n\r\n“A notion very prevalent until then, and which has not yet disappeared\r\nentirely, was that there is a remedy for every disease, and that\r\nwhenever a patient is not cured of his illness it is due, not to the\r\nlimitations of the healing art, but to the fact that treatment was not\r\nbegun early enough, or his doctor didn’t know enough, or didn’t care\r\nenough to give him the right medicine. About that time it began to dawn\r\non the most thoughtful and capable medical men that the course of\r\ndisease can usually not be quickly checked; that most diseases run a\r\ndefinite course; that most patients recover spontaneously, or the\r\ndisease persists to the end and is not much influenced by any of the\r\nremedies used. About that time medical men began to appreciate also\r\nanother fact: that underlying most diseases, there is a natural tendency\r\ntoward recovery, which means that most diseases will cure themselves if\r\ngiven time enough.\r\n\r\n“While medical men insist that the practice of medicine is both a\r\nscience and an art, they are also perfectly willing to admit that it is\r\nneither an exact science nor a perfect art. In other words, modern\r\nmedicine admits that it has not yet scaled the heights or fathomed the\r\ndepths of scientific knowledge in regard to the nature of disease or of\r\nits cure. It is still willing to learn. Indeed, it realizes the fact\r\nthat there is still infinitely more to learn than has yet been found\r\nout. And there is no avenue of human knowledge which it is not willing\r\nto explore in order to find out things that will get the sick well and\r\nkeep the well from getting sick.\r\n\r\n“A stunning blow to the old notions of the nature of disease and to the\r\nold methods of treatment, was administered about thirty years ago by the\r\ndiscovery that most diseases are due to infinitely small, living\r\norganisms, called germs or bacteria, which prey upon, or poison the\r\ntissues of the body, and thereby disturb, more or less seriously, some,\r\nor all, of the normal functions of the body. The scientific laboratory\r\nthereupon became the shrine of modern medicine; a new epoch in medicine\r\nhad arrived.\r\n\r\n“This new epoch meant not only that medical and surgical disorders were\r\nhenceforth to be treated in a much more scientific and rational way than\r\nthey had been in the past, but that one of the greatest scientific\r\nconquests of the ages was underway—the intelligent prevention of\r\ndisease. Preventive medicine had been born. Soon thereafter a new and\r\nunprecedented popular interest in medical matters became prevalent.\r\nNewspapers, magazines and the public forum took a hand in popularizing\r\nthis new knowledge of the nature of disease and the methods of\r\npreventing disease, which was founded on the new knowledge. Disease\r\nbegan to be looked on no longer as only a mysterious dispensation of\r\nProvidence, but as a thing which, as scientific medicine advanced, was\r\nmore and more to come under the knowledge and control of science.\r\n\r\n“In no domain of modern medicine have greater advances been made than in\r\nsurgery, due chiefly to the discovery of the role which germs play in\r\nthe causation of surgical troubles. Because of the discovery of the\r\nnecessity of asepsis (the absence of germs) in surgical operations and\r\nits practical application, operations, which, if done thirty years ago,\r\nwould have been almost invariably fatal, can now be done nearly with\r\nimpunity. Then, surgical operations in large surgical clinics were done\r\nby men in Prince Albert coats. Today, the surgeon and his assistants are\r\narrayed in sterilized white gowns and rubber gloves with caps for their\r\nheads and special coverings for mouth and nose, which are worn in order\r\nto prevent any unfiltered, contaminated vapor from these orifices coming\r\nin contact with the freshly made wound. Where proper precautions are\r\ntaken, and no pus or other filth has come in contact with the wound,\r\nsome of the most extensive operations are followed by immediate repair,\r\nwithout the formation of pus in the wound. To enumerate even a small\r\npart of the triumphs of modern surgery would occupy too much space and\r\nis uncalled for here, and these triumphs would have been impossible\r\nbefore the advent of surgical cleanliness.\r\n\r\n“But modern medicine does not stop at treating or curing people. It does\r\nsomething even bigger and better—it tries to keep them well. Indeed, the\r\nmedical profession is the only immolating profession there is—the only\r\nprofession that is all the time trying, by its efforts in the direction\r\nof preventive medicine, to destroy its only source of income—the\r\ntreatment of disease—by doing all within its power to make disease less\r\nand less prevalent. It is continually urging better personal and public\r\nhygiene and sanitation. Because medical men understand the stunting\r\neffects of ill health on the growing mind and body of the child, they\r\nare urging careful medical inspection of schools and school children,\r\nand they call for better health conditions in the family, the factory,\r\nand the mine, and they denounce without measure unhealthy child labor.\r\nModern medicine tries to banish from the home and school, as nearly as\r\nmay be, that brutal precept—“He that spareth the rod, hateth his son”—\r\nbecause it knows that the irritable, petulant, stubborn child may be a\r\nsick child, or has fools for parents, while the incorrigible boy or girl\r\nneeds the attention of an expert in nervous and mental diseases rather\r\nthan the brutality of an impatient, ignorant parent or policeman.\r\n\r\n“Modern medicine enters the jungle and by proper sanitary rules and\r\nregulations makes a deadly, miasmatic swamp a model of cleanliness and\r\nhealthfulness, as was done in the Panama canal zone, and without which\r\nthe building of the canal would have been impossible.\r\n\r\n“Modern medicine seeks to help and to save mankind, not only from\r\nphysical ills, but from moral ills as well. By the careful study of the\r\ninfluence of inheritance and environment on the development and the\r\nconduct of the child, it tries to make his physical inheritance as\r\nfavorable as possible, and his economic and social environment as\r\nhelpful as may be, realizing that much of our moral delinquency is due\r\nto unjust civic and economic conditions.”\r\n\r\nIt would require a volume to tell the story of the lives of all the\r\nearly-day physicians of this county. Investigation discloses the fact\r\nthat they were numerous, and that in addition to Dr. Stringfellow, who\r\ngave more of his time to political matters than to his profession, there\r\nwas a Dr. D. McVay here prior to 1860. He was a southern gentleman, but\r\napparently had more discretion than valor, for he fled from Atchison at\r\nthe beginning of the Civil war. Dr. William Grimes, concerning whose\r\nlife brief mention has been heretofore made in this history, was a\r\nphysician at Atchison in 1858. Dr. W. W. Cochrane was another physician\r\nof the old school, a courtly, amiable gentleman, and a good physician.\r\nHe was for a number of years treasurer of the Kansas Medical Society,\r\nand was a pioneer among physicians in administering chloroform in\r\nchildbirth cases. Dr. Arnold was here in 1859, and later, on a trip to\r\nDenver, he was scalped by the Indians. Dr. Joseph Malin, of Weston, Mo.,\r\nwho married one of the McAdows, was a physician in Atchison in 1861, and\r\nDr. J. V. Brining practiced in Atchison in 1862, and remained a\r\npractitioner here until 1914.\r\n\r\nDr. William Gough, who had been a Confederate army surgeon, located in\r\nAtchison shortly after the war. He practiced in St. Joseph before coming\r\nto Atchison, and also at DeKalb, where he married Mrs. Annie Dunning.\r\nFrom DeKalb he moved to Rushville, and then came to Atchison, where he\r\nformed a partnership with the late Dr. J. M. Linley. Together they\r\nenjoyed an extensive medical and surgical practice, until 1887, when Dr.\r\nGough moved to Los Angeles, Cal., for the benefit of his health. He died\r\nthere in 1908. Dr. Gough is described by his friends as being a man of\r\nlarge physique, the soul of honor, and displayed the utmost care and\r\ngentleness in the care of his patients.\r\n\r\nDr. W. L. Challiss came to Atchison in 1857, and while standing high in\r\nhis profession, gave most of his time to business affairs, and practiced\r\nonly spasmodically. There was also a Dr. Buddington in Atchison in 1864,\r\nwho ran a drug store at Fourth and Commercial streets.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting members of the medical profession in an\r\nearly day was Dr. Charles F. Kob, a German physician, who lived here\r\nabout 1858. Dr. Kob had been a surgeon in the army and a member of the\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut Medical Society. He founded the town of\r\nBunker Hill, on Independence creek, ten miles north of Atchison, to\r\nwhich reference has already been made in this history. He lived and\r\npracticed in Boston before coming to Atchison. Dr. Amaziah Moore was\r\nanother very early day physician, who located on a farm three or four\r\nmiles west of Lancaster, in 1857. He came from Ohio. In 1861 he helped\r\norganize a company for the Civil war, which became Company D of the\r\nSecond Kansas cavalry, of which he was captain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DR. W. W. COCHRANE\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM L. CHALLIS\r\n]\r\n\r\nDr. John C. Batsell lived about two and one-half miles northwest of\r\nMonrovia. He was a native of Kentucky, and was born in Marion county\r\nMarch 16, 1818. He was reared and educated in his native county, where\r\nhe took up the study of medicine, and became proficient in the science.\r\nHe commenced the practice of his profession in Valeene, Orange county,\r\nIndiana, where he continued successfully for over seven years. In the\r\nautumn of 1855 he came to Atchison county, along with John Graves and\r\nothers, and after looking around, went to DeKalb, Mo., where he remained\r\nuntil the spring of 1866, when he returned to Atchison county, and\r\npreëmpted a quarter section, upon which he lived, northwest of Monrovia.\r\nHe engaged in the practice of medicine in connection with farming, being\r\nfrequently called into Doniphan and Brown counties. Malarial diseases\r\nprevailed to a great extent in those early days, and the people were in\r\nstraitened circumstances. He furnished medicine and attended to their\r\nwants, losing largely in a financial way, as the greater portion of the\r\nfirst dwellers moved away. In 1863 Dr. Batsell organized one-half of\r\nCompany D, Thirteenth Kansas, of which he was tendered the captaincy,\r\nbut declined and accepted the position of first lieutenant. On account\r\nof serious illness he only served three months in the army. He was major\r\nof the Thirteenth Kansas during the Price raid, and at the close of the\r\nwar was elected to the legislature by the Republican party. He was\r\noriginally an old-line Whig, but upon the organization of the Republican\r\nparty he joined it, as he was in favor of the abolition of slavery.\r\nDuring his latter years he discontinued his practice and devoted his\r\ntime to his farm. He died about ten years ago.\r\n\r\nDr. David Wait came from Missouri to Kansas in 1859 and settled on a\r\nfarm near Eden postoffice, now known as the Vollmer farm. He was a\r\nstriking-looking man and was looked upon as very proficient in his\r\nprofession. He was an ardent Union man. In fact, Dr. Moore, Dr. Batsell\r\nand Dr. Wait were all of great help to the Union cause in the days\r\nbefore the war.\r\n\r\nAmong other leading physicians of the county, outside of Atchison, of\r\nthe early days, were Dr. J. F. Martin, Dr. S. G. Page, Dr. C. C.\r\nStivers, and Dr. Desmond, concerning whom the following information is\r\navailable:\r\n\r\nDr. J. F. Martin was one of the first practitioners in Atchison county.\r\nHe was a native of Bourbon county, Kentucky, and was born September 29,\r\n1828. He graduated at the Transylvania Medical University, in 1854, and\r\nafterwards took a course of lectures in St. Louis Medical University.\r\nSubsequently he removed to DeKalb, Mo., where he practiced until 1856,\r\ncoming to Kansas about the same time that Dr. Batsell came. He had a\r\nlarge practice in Doniphan and Brown counties. He practiced ten years,\r\nand returned to Decatur, Ill., in 1866, where he remained seven years,\r\nand returned to Kansas, locating in Effingham. He died in Effingham in\r\n1877.\r\n\r\nDr. S. G. Page, a native of Juniata county, Pennsylvania, was born July\r\n16, 1845. He attended Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York in\r\n1867: came to Kansas in 1868, and located in Center township, five miles\r\nsouth of Effingham, where he located on a farm which he operated a few\r\nyears, and then located in Effingham.\r\n\r\nDr. C. C. Stivers, a native of Brown county, Ohio, was born January 6,\r\n1842. He enlisted in Company A, Sixtieth Ohio Volunteer infantry;\r\nparticipated in the battles of Bull Run, Cross Keys and Port Royal.\r\nReturning from the war, he took a course of lectures at Miami University\r\nin Oxford Ohio; located in Eden in 1877 and practiced until 1881, when\r\nhe became a resident of Effingham. In 1880 he attended Keokuk Medical\r\nCollege, graduating from that institution. He had the reputation of\r\nbeing a brilliant conversationalist and a very interesting gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe first doctor to locate at Lancaster was Dr. Desmond, who went there\r\nin the latter seventies. While there he married a Miss Streeper, of Good\r\nIntent, and about 1885 moved to Stewartsville, Mo. Dr. Desmond was\r\nsucceeded at Lancaster by Dr. A. L. Charles, who came there from Bunker\r\nHill, Russell county, Kansas, where he had gone four years previously,\r\nafter graduating from the Kansas City Medical College. Soon after\r\nlocating at Lancaster, Dr. Charles married Miss Alice Keeney, who lived\r\nnear Lancaster. Dr. and Mrs. Charles raised a family of seven children,\r\nthe eldest of whom is the Atchison surgeon, Dr. Hugh L. Charles. Mrs.\r\nCharles died of pneumonia in the Atchison hospital in January, 1915. Dr.\r\nCharles has been a very successful physician. He enjoys the profoundest\r\nrespect of his colleagues throughout the county, who regard him as an\r\nideal physician. It is needless to add that he also enjoys the utmost\r\nconfidence and esteem of a clientele whose numbers are limited only by\r\nhis ability to serve.\r\n\r\nThe first physician at Mt. Pleasant was Dr. Eagle, who located there\r\nduring territorial days and practiced for a number of years. Dr. Jacob\r\nLarry also located at Mt. Pleasant about 1856. He was a South\r\nCarolinian, and a graduate of Charleston Medical College. During the war\r\nhe was a surgeon in the army. He located in Iatan, Mo., and was building\r\nup a large practice when he committed suicide by taking strychnine and\r\nthen blowing his brains out with a pistol. Before moving to Iatan Dr.\r\nLarry induced Dr. John Parsons, of King’s Bridge, N. Y., who also had\r\nbeen an army surgeon, to come to Mt. Pleasant. Dr. Parsons practiced\r\nthere several years, and his practice became so large that he finally\r\ninduced Dr. George W. Redmon to locate at Mt. Pleasant and assist him.\r\nDr. Redmon located there in the fall of 1872, and remained a number of\r\nyears, later locating at Oak Mills. There was also a Dr. W. W. Crook at\r\nMt. Pleasant, in the seventies. Dr. Crook also practiced in Doniphan,\r\nand later moved to Wyoming. Dr. P. R. Moore was another physician who\r\nlocated in Mt. Pleasant township during the seventies, as was also Dr.\r\nJohnson. Dr. Charles H. Linley, now a resident physician of Atchison,\r\npracticed in Mt. Pleasant for a number of years, and following Dr.\r\nLinley came Dr. Miller and Dr. Rice. Dr. Roberts had a small drug store\r\nand practiced medicine at Oak Mills in the early days. He was addicted\r\nto the liquor habit, and was found dead in his office one morning. He\r\nhad been preceded in practice at Oak Mills by Dr. Earle, who lived about\r\nhalf way between Oak Mills and Kickapoo, and who settled there during\r\nthe fifties.\r\n\r\nDr. J. M. Linley came to Atchison March 14, 1865. He was born in\r\nConcord, Ky., October 28, 1837. He attended college at Princeton, Ky.,\r\nand was graduated from Miami Medical College at Cincinnati, Ohio, in\r\nMarch, 1858, and subsequently attended lectures in Bellevue College, New\r\nYork. He was post surgeon at New Madrid, Mo., in 1864. Dr. Linley was\r\none of the most successful practitioners of Atchison and was held in\r\nhigh esteem. In 1891 he went abroad and attended clinics in hospitals of\r\nBerlin and London. He died in Phoenix, Ariz., November 28, 1900.\r\n\r\nThe following are the members of the Atchison County Medical Society as\r\nreported in 1915: Dr. C. H. Johnson, Dr. H. L. Charles, Dr. M. T.\r\nDingess, Dr. E. J. Bribach, Dr. Robert Dickey, Dr. E. P. Pitts, Dr. C.\r\nA. Lilly, Dr. Charles Robinson, Dr. C. H. Linley, Dr. T. E. Horner, Dr.\r\nF. A. Pearl, Dr. P. R. Moore, Emmingham, Dr. S. M. Myers, Potter, Dr. G.\r\nE. White, Effingham, Dr. G. W. Allaman, Dr. W. F. Smith, Dr. Virgil\r\nMorrison, Dr. E. T. Shelly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n                       INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL.\r\n\r\n  MUCH WEALTH AND ENTERPRISE ABOUND—MANUFACTURING—MILLING—EXTENSIVE\r\n      WHOLESALE HARDWARE AND GROCERY ESTABLISHMENTS—PLANING MILLS—\r\n      VARIOUS JOBBING AND RETAIL INTERESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustrial enterprises of Atchison county, so far as manufacturing and\r\njobbing interests are concerned, are confined exclusively to the city of\r\nAtchison. There are no mills or factories or large manufacturing\r\ninstitutions in any of the smaller towns of the county. Outside of\r\nAtchison the labor and industry of the citizens are directed in\r\nagricultural pursuits; the tilling of the soil, the breeding of live\r\nstock and the development of all the other arts of husbandry, but in the\r\ncity of Atchison there are a number of establishments which give\r\nemployment to labor, and which in a number of instances ship their\r\nfinished products to all parts of the United States and into the ports\r\nof foreign countries.\r\n\r\nAtchison, however, strictly speaking, is not a factory town, nor a great\r\nmanufacturing center. There have been times in its history when it was\r\nmore important, commercially, than now, but that was in the days before\r\nthe great onrush to Kansas City. Yet the town today is a substantial,\r\nsolid community, where much wealth and enterprise abound, and where\r\nthere has been a steady, healthy commercial growth.\r\n\r\nThe largest manufacturing plant is the John Seaton Foundry Company, and\r\nthe Locomotive Finished Material Company, an associated enterprise,\r\nestablished by the late John Seaton, who moved to Atchison from Alton,\r\nIll., in 1871, having been induced to come to Atchison by a handsome\r\ndonation from the citizens of the town. Mr. Seaton originally\r\nmanufactured much architectural work; iron and brass casting, boilers,\r\njail and sheet iron work. For a while it was conducted under the firm\r\nname of Seaton & Lea, but shortly before the death of Captain Seaton, a\r\nfew years ago, the Locomotive Finished Material Company was organized to\r\nput the finishing touches on castings and at the death of Mr. Seaton, H.\r\nE. Muchnic became president and general manager of the company, with\r\nJohn C. Seaton, Clive Hastings, W. S. Ferguson and G. L. Seaton as\r\nassociate directors. The average number of employees is about 226, when\r\nthe total horse power is 500. They have a payroll of over $14,000 a\r\nmonth, and are doing a large business with railroads and other big\r\nindustrial plants throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe Manglesdorf Brothers Company is one of the oldest establishments in\r\nthe city. It began in 1875 as a side line in connection with the retail\r\ngrocery business, by August and William Manglesdorf, and is now\r\nconducted by the sons of the founders. It is one of the largest seed\r\nhouses in the West. The business was incorporated in 1887, and the\r\nofficers in 1916 are as follows: August Manglesdorf, president: A. F.\r\nManglesdorf, vice-president: Ed. F. Manglesdorf, vice-president: F. H.\r\nManglesdorf, treasurer, and F. W. Manglesdorf, secretary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Manglesdorf Bros. Seed Company]\r\n\r\nThe business has grown to such an extent that it was thought advisable\r\nto close out the retail end of it and it is now conducted as an\r\nexclusively wholesale seed house. The new warehouse, which the firm now\r\noccupies, was erected last year and gives it one of the largest and most\r\ncomplete plants in the West. The new building is modern in every way,\r\nstrictly fire-proof and provides an enormous space for storing and\r\nhandling the stocks, which are accumulated for the spring trade. The\r\nseed line, perhaps more than any other, is a seasonable one, and by far\r\nthe greater proportion of the year’s business must be crowded into a few\r\nspring months. It is necessary, therefore, to move goods quickly and in\r\nlarge quantities, when the season is on. For this purpose, the\r\nwarehouses are equipped with suitable machinery and devices, which are\r\nkept up to the highest possible efficiency for handling and cleaning the\r\nseed. The stocks are obtained in all parts of the world. When crops fail\r\nin one part of the country, it is the business of the seed dealers to\r\nsupply the deficiency from some other sections, where conditions have\r\nbeen more favorable. Thus, the source of supply and the outlet for it\r\nare constantly shifting and it requires keeping in touch with the\r\nprogress of the crops and market conditions in many different producing\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nThe firm does a considerable export business also, particularly in blue\r\ngrass and timothy, which are produced here, cheaper and in better\r\nquality than they are in Europe. During each year the firm’s travelers\r\ncover the States of Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, parts of Nebraska,\r\nColorado and Texas. Its line of garden seeds may be obtained from the\r\nlocal merchants in nearly every town in this territory.\r\n\r\nThe Bailor Plow Company, of Atchison, organized in 1910 with an\r\nauthorized capital of $50,000. J. M. Schott, president; Charles Linley,\r\nvice-president; W. P. Byram, secretary; E. V. Jones, treasurer and\r\nmanager. Manufacturers of a two-row cultivator. S. E. Bailor, then of\r\nBeatrice, Neb., some twenty years since built and began experimenting\r\nwith a two-row cultivator. About 1905, the late David Rankin, of Tarkio,\r\nMo., placed fifty Bailor cultivators in use on his 25,000–acre farm near\r\nTarkio, giving them a thorough test for efficiency. The result was such\r\nthat he induced Bailor to build a plant for their manufacture at Tarkio.\r\nIn 1910 the Atchison Commercial Club, which had previously investigated\r\nthe possibilities of Bailor’s factory as a valuable addition to this\r\ncity’s industrial institutions, induced him to locate his business in\r\nAtchison. The Bailor Plow Company was promoted and incorporated by the\r\nfollowing successful business men: Balie P. Waggener, Henry\r\nKlostermeier, T. R. Clendinen, at that time president of the Commercial\r\nClub; O. A. Simmons, vice-president of the First National Bank; E. V.\r\nJones, J. M. Schott, W. P. Byram, Charles Linley, at that time treasurer\r\nof Atchison county, and S. E. Bailor, inventor of the cultivator. During\r\nthe year 1910, the first year of operation in Atchison, one hundred\r\ncultivators were sold. The year 1915 shows an output of product valued\r\nat about $250,000. The company’s plant has a floor space of 25,000\r\nsquare feet; forty men are on its payroll and it disburses in wages over\r\n$50,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe National Poultry and Egg Company. This institution is one of the\r\nlargest of its kind in the West, and is located on the corner of\r\nFourteenth and Main streets. Under the able management of G. E. Hanna,\r\nit has steadily increased its capacity and enlarged its business\r\noperations until at the present time it employs an average of fifty-four\r\nmen and women a month and pays out in wages almost $30,000 each year.\r\nThe plant and machinery represent an investment of about $70,000 and its\r\nsales are over a half million dollars a year. It is engaged in buying\r\nand selling poultry, eggs and butter, and ships fancy dressed poultry to\r\neastern markets.\r\n\r\nDeer Creek Creamery Company. This company has a capital stock of\r\n$10,000; employs eight men and four girls, with an annual payroll of\r\n$8,000. In addition to the employees in the local office, it also\r\nemploys twenty men in the country to operate its numerous cream\r\nstations. The company manufactures over a half million pounds of butter\r\na year, and it puts up and sells in Atchison from 80,000 to 100,000\r\ngallons of milk every year, in addition to 6,000 or 8,000 gallons of ice\r\ncream. Over $125,000 annually is paid out to Kansas farmers for cream;\r\nabout $25,000 of this amount going to farmers in the immediate vicinity\r\nof Atchison. It is one of the growing institutions of the city, and the\r\nexcellence of the products it turns out is the cause for its constant\r\nincrease of business.\r\n\r\nAtchison is also the home of two large manufacturers of saddlery. The\r\nAtchison Saddlery Company is the successor to Louis Kiper & Sons and\r\noccupies a large building on Kansas avenue between Fourth and Fifth\r\nstreets. Its officers are George Diegel, president; George T. Lindsey,\r\nvice-president, and Henry Diegel, secretary-treasurer. It has a capital\r\nstock of $150,000; employs seventy-nine people. It ships its products\r\ninto many States of the West and has been doing an exceedingly large\r\nbusiness in the past few years.\r\n\r\nKessler-Barkow Saddlery Company was incorporated several years ago, with\r\nG. T. Bolman, president; F. A. Barkow, vice-president, and H. B.\r\nKessler, secretary and treasurer. This company has a capital and surplus\r\nof $85,000, and employs sixty-five people, and has an average annual\r\npayroll of about $40,000.00. It manufactures harness and saddles for the\r\njobbing trade exclusively and has large accounts with the Blish, Mize &\r\nSilliman Hardware Company, Montgomery, Ward & Company and Sears, Roebuck\r\n& Company.\r\n\r\nThe Atchison Leather Products Company is another growing institution of\r\nAtchison, the officers of which are the same as that of the Kessler-\r\nBarkow Saddlery Company. This company are producers of cut leather parts\r\nof all kinds, and are large buyers of scrap leather. It has a capital\r\nstock of $7,000.00 and employs fifteen people. Its sales for 1915\r\namounted to over $65,000.00, and it also handles various leather\r\nspecialties and automobile accessories.\r\n\r\nAtchison is also the home of three large mills. The Blair Milling\r\nCompany, the Cain Milling Company and the Lukens Milling Company, and\r\nthese mills handle an average of 20,000 to 25,000 cars of grain\r\nannually, and ship out finished wheat and corn products of 4,000 to\r\n5,000 cars every year. The Lukens Milling Company has recently erected\r\ncement storage tanks for storage of grain, of the capacity of 125,000\r\nbushels, and the Blair Elevator Company, which is operated by J. W. and\r\nW. A. Blair, in 1915, also erected cement storage tanks to the capacity\r\nof 200,000 bushels. The growth of the mills of Atchison is logical, for\r\nthey are located in a rich agricultural section, and consequently the\r\nmills are among the most important enterprises in the city. In each case\r\nthe mills of Atchison are being operated by the sons of its founders.\r\nThe Blair mill was established by E. K. Blair, in an early day of the\r\nhistory of Atchison, and is now managed by his sons, J. W. and W. A.\r\nBlair. The Lukens mill was founded by David Lukens, who came to Atchison\r\nin 1857. He operated a sawmill and raised corn in Missouri bottoms until\r\n1877, when he built the Diamond Mills, now conducted by his sons, Arthur\r\nLukens, Edwin Lukens and David Lukens. The original Cain Mill Company\r\nwas established by John M. Cain and Alfred Cain, and its successor, the\r\nCain Milling Company, is operated by Douglas M. Cain, the son of Alfred\r\nCain.\r\n\r\nAtchison is also the home of two of the largest wholesale hardware\r\nstores on the Missouri river, both of which began operations here at\r\napproximately the same time. The operations of the Blish, Mize &\r\nSilliman Hardware Company are the largest of the two companies. This\r\ncompany travels thirty men and has an office and store force of eighty-\r\neight men and women. It has an annual payroll of $115,000.00. It was\r\nfounded by D. P. Blish, E. A. Mize and J. B. Silliman, who were all\r\nrelated by marriage. The company began in a small way as a successor to\r\nJ. E. Wagner & Company, and has branched out in its business until it\r\ncovers several States and territories. It occupies a magnificent re-\r\ninforced concrete fire-proof structure at the corner of Fifth and Utah\r\navenue, and its business has been increasing from year to year.\r\n\r\nThe A. J. Harwi Hardware Company is owned and controlled largely by F.\r\nE. Harwi, the son of its founder, and a full account of its operations\r\nappears in a sketch of the life and career of A. J. Harwi in this\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAtchison is particularly proud of the fact that it is one of the best\r\njobbing centers in this part of the country, and in this connection the\r\nwholesale grocery business is well represented in the two splendid firms\r\nof the Dolan Mercantile Company and the Symns Grocery Company. The Dolan\r\nMercantile Company was established by W. F. Dolan, one of the pioneers\r\nof Atchison, who started in a small way as a retail grocer merchant, and\r\ndied leaving a splendidly established wholesale grocery business, which\r\nis now conducted by M. J. Horan and Leo Nusbaum. This house, under the\r\nable management of these two young men is rapidly making for itself a\r\nbig reputation among wholesale dealers and grocers. In addition to\r\njobbing regular lines of merchandise this company has recently installed\r\nits own plant for the manufacture of fluid extracts, baking powder and\r\npancake flour, and also roasts its own coffees. It has a large traveling\r\nforce, visiting the States of Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma,\r\nand the Dolan brands are well known throughout this whole territory.\r\n\r\nThe Symns Grocery Company was established by A. B. Symns, who came to\r\nKansas from West Virginia, with his three brothers, in 1858, where he\r\nsettled in the town of Doniphan and engaged in mercantile pursuits,\r\nuntil he removed to Atchison in 1872. He opened a wholesale and retail\r\ngrocery here in that year, and continued in business without a partner\r\nuntil March, 1878, when the firm became Symns & Turner, under which name\r\nit was run until 1880, when it was changed to A. B. Symns & Company. It\r\nwas subsequently incorporated into the Symns Grocery Company, and at the\r\ndeath of A. B. Symns, the business was run by J. W. Allen, J. E. Moore,\r\nC. A. Lockwood and Tom Gray. It operates in about the same territory\r\nthat the Dolan Mercantile Company operates in, and its present\r\nenterprising management is keeping up the splendid reputation\r\nestablished by its founder.\r\n\r\nThe Odell Cider & Vinegar Company is a new institution in Atchison. A.\r\nLeo is manager, and $30,000.00 is invested in the plant and equipment\r\nhere. This company pressed out over 200,00 bushels of apples in 1915,\r\nand made 650,000 gallons of vinegar. Forty men are employed during the\r\npressing season, and over $30,000.00 a year is paid out for apples,\r\nwhich are converted into 150,000 gallons of vinegar, which is shipped to\r\nvarious points in the United States during 1915.\r\n\r\nThe Stevenson planing mill employs twelve men, with a payroll of about\r\n$10,000.00 a year and annual sales aggregating $27,000.00. S. R.\r\nStevenson, who for many years was employed by the old Atchison Furniture\r\nCompany, is at the head of this business. He settled in Atchison in\r\n1865, and learned cabinet making with Dickinson & Company, of this city.\r\n\r\nIt would require a volume to properly elaborate upon the operations of\r\nthe various commercial enterprises of Atchison. What has been given is\r\nthe merest outline of the industrial activities here. The brief\r\nreference to the several business houses and manufacturing plants is\r\nmade merely for the purpose of showing the character of the industrial\r\nlife of the county.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those enumerated there are other jobbing and\r\nmanufacturing interests operating, in some instances on as large a\r\nscale, and in other instances on a smaller scale, but which in\r\nthemselves are just as important. Reference has not been made to the\r\nKlostermeier Hardware Company, one of the largest jobbers in hardware in\r\nnortheastern Kansas, or to L. W. Voigt & Company, large shippers of\r\nfruit, vegetables and produce, or to Kean & Tucker, operating along the\r\nsame line; neither has the James Poultry Company been mentioned, which\r\nis one of Atchison’s growing concerns. There are also manufacturers of\r\ncigars, brooms and barrels; large distributors of automobiles and\r\nautomobile accessories, and candy manufacturers. The Railway Specialty\r\nCompany, manufacturers of gasoline propelled railway track cars is\r\nmaking substantial progress. From a small beginning it has forged ahead,\r\nunder the able management of Clive Hastings, until it has reached a\r\npoint where it will soon take its place among the leading track car\r\nmanufacturers of this country. Already the company has shipped its cars\r\nto foreign parts, and it has also supplied many of the large railroads\r\nof the United States with its cars. The Weiss Cornice Company is the\r\nlatest arrival in Atchison. This company makes metal cornices, window\r\nframes and other builders’ fire-proof specialties. It recently moved\r\nhere from Kansas City and is already a large employer of labor. The\r\nWasher Grain Company, established by Maj. S. H. Washer, does a large\r\ngrain business, and is still managed by Major Washer, who recently\r\npassed his eightieth birthday. He is ably assisted by his son, W. R.\r\nWasher, who is also otherwise prominently identified with the commercial\r\nand shipping interests of the county.\r\n\r\nAtchison also is a fine retail center, and draws trade from the\r\nsurrounding territory for a distance of from fifty to seventy-five\r\nmiles. It has fine dry goods stores, which carry the latest merchandise;\r\ngood shoe stores, millinery shops, grocery and hardware stores and shops\r\nof all kinds, all of which are run by enterprising merchants. Atchison\r\nis a good town in which to live; a city of beautiful homes; fine paved\r\nand well lighted streets; a good water system and adequate street car\r\nservice, and a fine, prosperous set of people. The future of Atchison,\r\nas a commercial center, is particularly bright, and it may look back\r\nwith a justifiable pride to what has already been accomplished, and\r\nforward to a better day that is yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n                   PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND INSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\n  ATCHISON POSTOFFICE—COURT HOUSE—COUNTY HOSPITAL—YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN\r\n      ASSOCIATION—STATE ORPHANS’ HOME—ATCHISON PUBLIC LIBRARY—ATCHISON\r\n      HOSPITAL—MASONIC TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first postoffice in Atchison opened in a small, one-story, stone\r\nbuilding, on the south side of Commercial street, between Second and\r\nThird. The room was about 20×26 feet in dimensions, but large enough for\r\nthe purpose for which it was intended at that time. The location of the\r\npostoffice was removed in 1856 to the store of Messrs. Woolfolk &\r\nCabell, on the levee. During the war in Kansas, in August, the\r\nheadquarters of the United States mail service were removed to the law\r\noffice of P. P. Wilcox. From there the office was removed to a building\r\non the north side of Commercial street, between Third and Fourth, and it\r\nwas there that in July, 1882, the free delivery system was inaugurated\r\nin Atchison, which, with her money order department fully equipped the\r\npostoffice. A number of years later agitation was started for the\r\nerection of a new postoffice, and through the efforts of Senator Ingalls\r\na site at the northeast corner of Seventh and Kansas avenue was\r\npurchased from Dr. Cochrane by the Government, and the contract was\r\nawarded for the erection of the postoffice June 24, 1892, at a cost of\r\n$61,703.17.\r\n\r\nThe names and terms of the postmasters of Atchison since the founding of\r\nthe office are as follows: Robert S. Kelly, March 15, 1855; John H.\r\nBlasingham, December 20, 1855; Henry Addoms, July 28, 1857; John A.\r\nMartin, April 26, 1861; Benjamin B. Gale, March 5, 1874; John M. Price,\r\nFebruary 6, 1879; Melleville C. Winegar, March 10, 1882; H. Clay Park,\r\nMarch 30, 1886; Solomon R. Washer, March 20, 1890; Edgar C. Post, June\r\n7, 1894; James M. Chisham, June 3, 1898; William D. Casey, December 14,\r\n1910; Louis C. Orr, December 29, 1914, who is postmaster in 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COURT HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe present court house of this county occupies lots 1, 2 and 3, in\r\nblock 65, Old Atchison, and the contract for the building was entered\r\ninto on the twenty-first day of May, 1896, and accepted by the board of\r\ncounty commissioners September 13, 1897. The total cost of building and\r\nfixtures was $83,154.48.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            COUNTY HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\nThe present county hospital for the poor is located on the southeast\r\nquarter of section 14, township 6, range 20. The farm was purchased from\r\nR. A. Park October 7, 1903, for $9,540, and the hospital was erected\r\nJanuary 3, 1905, at a cost of $27,501. The average cost of operating the\r\nhospital and farm of 160 acres is approximately $2,109.16 per year, and\r\nthe average number of inmates is thirty. The present superintendent is\r\nJ. S. Clingan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\nOn December 2, 1911, there met in the office of C. S. Hull a small group\r\nof men interested in securing a modern Young Men’s Christian Association\r\nbuilding for the city of Atchison. Although this is the first formal\r\nmeeting of which there are any minutes recorded it is known that the\r\nidea of an organization and building had long existed in the mind of\r\nWilliam Carlisle, and that encouragement was given him by many others.\r\nAt the meeting held on December 2 the Atchison Y. M. C. A. Promotion\r\nClub was formally launched with Claude B. Fisk as president.\r\n\r\nAt the next meeting, held January 1, 1912, an executive committee,\r\ncomposed of R. W. Ramsay, W. B. Collett, Fred Oliver, and C. S. Hull was\r\nelected and the secretary was authorized to invite John E. Manley, State\r\nsecretary of the Young Men’s Christian Association, to be present at the\r\nnext meeting of the club.\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 1912, the club met at the Byram Hotel for luncheon. Mr.\r\nManley was present at this meeting and outlined a plan for a campaign to\r\nraise the necessary funds to erect a modern building. The luncheon\r\nmeeting adjourned to meet at the office of H. H. Hackney at 4 p. m., at\r\nwhich time a business committee of twenty-five men was appointed. The\r\nfollowing composed this committee: H. B. Mize, Fred Oliver, Eugene Howe,\r\nW. B. Collett, C. S. Hull, George Guerrier, R. W. Ramsay, Sheffield\r\nIngalls, D. M. Cain, F. W. Woodford, A. F. Heck, August Manglesdorf,\r\nJr., T. A. Moxcey, Eugene Pulliam, E. W. Clausen, Clive Hastings, H. H.\r\nHackney, N. T. Veatch, W. P. Waggener, W. J. Bailey, Charles Linley, Roy\r\nSeaton, Claude Fisk, J. A. Shoemaker, Holmes Dysinger. This committee\r\nwas later increased to twenty-seven, and the names of W. A. Carlisle and\r\nW. A. Jackson were added.\r\n\r\nThe first regular meeting of the provisional committee, as it was now\r\ncalled, was held at the Blish, Mize & Silliman offices March 13 and a\r\npermanent organization effected. State Secretary Manley was present. R.\r\nW. Ramsay, the present incumbent, was made president at this meeting;\r\nCharles Linley, vice-president; C. S. Hull, recording secretary, and\r\nGeorge Guerrier, treasurer. T. C. Treat at this time tendered the use of\r\na room in the Simpson building for an office for the organization, which\r\nwas gratefully accepted.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the executive committee, held March 18, 1912. L. V.\r\nStarkey was employed as general secretary and took active charge of the\r\nbuilding campaign April 15.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting held April 22 it was decided to raise $100,000 by public\r\nsubscription, and the following team captains were elected: S. R. Beebe,\r\nO. A. Simmons, H. B. Mize, John R. Taylor, F. M. Woodford, L. M. Baker,\r\nCharles A. Brown, W. D. Casey, W. W. Hetherington, and W. A. Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe charter for the organization bears the date of April 6 and was duly\r\nacted upon and signed by the committee of twenty-seven at a meeting held\r\nApril 22.\r\n\r\nIn a ten days’ campaign conducted May 15–25, 1912, an amount\r\napproximating $85,000 was raised by popular subscription. The\r\nheadquarters of the campaign were in a room furnished by J. C. Killarney\r\nat 105–107 North Fifth street.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of June, 1912. the site at the northeast corner of\r\nFourth and Commercial streets was contracted for and work begun at once\r\non the building. On December 4, 1913, the splendid building which now\r\noccupies that corner was formally opened for the regular work of the\r\nassociation. The membership soon reached 450, and has been maintained at\r\nabout that point ever since.\r\n\r\nThe entire cost of building, including site and furnishings, amounted to\r\n$113,000.\r\n\r\nThe Y. M. C. A. building contains thirty-four living rooms with a\r\ncapacity for fifty men. These rooms are now kept filled practically all\r\nthe time. A restaurant is operated on the ground floor and there are\r\nexcellent facilities for handling banquets and committee meetings. The\r\nbuilding is always at the disposal of church societies and other\r\norganizations for gatherings of any kind.\r\n\r\nThere is a gymnasium, 44×72 feet, thoroughly equipped with all necessary\r\napparatus and a white tile-lined swimming pool, 20×50 feet. With a\r\nseparate entrance on Fourth street, there is a special game room for\r\nboys ten to fifteen years of age.\r\n\r\nThe present board of directors is composed of R. W. Ramsay as president;\r\nB. L. Brockett, vice-president; H. H. Hackney, recording secretary;\r\nCharles Lanley, treasurer; Messrs. W. B. Collett, M. T. Dingess, Claud\r\nB. Fisk, J. A. Fletcher, C. C. Ham, W. W. Hetherington, Martin Jensen,\r\nJ. F. Krueger, H. P. Shepherd, and F. M. Woodford.\r\n\r\nThe present general secretary, Ira J. Beard, came to the association in\r\nApril, 1914. Emmett T. Ireland is the present physical director, and\r\nGeorge Kassabaum is the assistant secretary.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of December, 1914, an anniversary banquet was held in the\r\ngymnasium, celebrating the first year of the association in its new\r\nbuilding, and the reports of the work accomplished at that time\r\ndispelled any feeling there may have been on the part of some that such\r\nan institution could not be successfully maintained in Atchison. This\r\nbanquet was attended by 200 enthusiastic friends and members of the\r\nassociation, and Governor Arthur Capper was a guest of honor.\r\n\r\nMembership in the Young Men’s Christian Association is open to any boy\r\nor man of good character who is over ten years of age. Membership in the\r\nAtchison association is accepted and honored in all other Young Men’s\r\nChristian associations throughout the country. The dominant purpose of\r\nthe association is the building up of Christian character.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          STATE ORPHANS’ HOME.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of the State of Kansas at the session of 1885 enacted\r\nthe first law for the establishing of a Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home at\r\nAtchison, Kan. For the purpose of erecting the first building the\r\nlegislature appropriated the sum of $24,300 on condition that the land\r\nshould be donated to the State.\r\n\r\nThe act of the legislature provided that said Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home\r\n“shall be an institution for the nurture, education and maintenance,\r\nwithout charge, for all indigent children of soldiers who served in the\r\narmy and navy of the Union during the late rebellion, and who have been\r\ndisabled from wounds or disease, or who have since died in indigent\r\ncircumstances, and other indigent orphan children of the State.” The\r\ninstitution was located at Atchison, Kan., on the present site which was\r\npurchased from the late J. P. Brown and donated to the State. In\r\npursuance of the act of the legislature a portion of what is now the\r\nmain building was erected and by a subsequent appropriation was\r\nfinished, and the first children were admitted on July 1, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe original building was a four-story brick building with a basement.\r\nThe fourth story was made into a dormitory, with five rooms for\r\nemployes. The third story consisted of a smaller dormitory, lavatories,\r\nrooms for employes and sleeping room for the superintendent. The second\r\nstory had school rooms, superintendent’s office, parlor, lavatories and\r\nrooms for employes. The first floor rooms were dining room, kitchen,\r\nstore room, school rooms. The basement was used for boilers, store\r\nrooms, laundry and boys’ lavatory.\r\n\r\nThe laws regulating the home were amended and enlarged by the\r\nlegislature at its session of 1889, so that all children sound in mind\r\nand body and over two years of age and under fourteen years, belonging\r\nto any one of the following named classes shall be eligible for\r\nadmission to the home: “First, any child dependent upon the public for\r\nsupport; any dependent, neglected and ill-treated child who is an object\r\nof public concern, and whom the State may have power to exercise and\r\nextend its protection and control.”\r\n\r\nThis act of the legislature so increased the number of eligible for\r\nadmission to the home that it soon became necessary to enlarge the\r\nbuilding. In 1891 the legislature again appropriated the sum of $7,000\r\nfor the erection of the west wing, to be the same width and height as\r\nthe main building, and to increase the length by thirty feet and this\r\ngave play room, sitting room, school room and sleeping room for the\r\nkindergarten children, also a room in which the John A. Martin Memorial\r\nLibrary was placed, and a reading room in the upper story for the larger\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nConnected with this appropriation was $1,000 for a hospital building\r\nwhich is detached from the main building by about 100 feet.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the institution and the number desiring admission made it\r\nnecessary to again ask for an appropriation for more buildings. At the\r\nsession of the legislature of 1895 the legislature appropriated $91,800\r\nfor the erection of the east wing and for three cottages, 50×42 feet,\r\nand a building for domestic purposes, 40×110 feet, which contains the\r\nchapel, children’s dining room, one large school room, kitchen, store\r\nroom, one employes’ dining room and eight rooms for employes.\r\n\r\nAt the legislative session of 1907 an appropriation of $25,000 was made\r\nfor the purpose of erecting a new cottage on the Orphans’ Home grounds,\r\nto be used for the purpose of caring for destitute crippled children who\r\nwere otherwise unprovided for under the various acts of the legislature\r\nproviding for the Orphans’ Home. The foundation for this building was\r\ncommenced on the seventeenth day of October, 1909, and the building was\r\ncompleted, and ready for the occupancy of children July 1, 1910. The law\r\nproviding for only children sound in mind and body between the ages of\r\ntwo and fourteen years shall be admitted. This cottage at the present\r\ntime is used for the older girls of the institution and it seems very\r\nwell adapted for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of 1903 very generously appropriated $20,000 to build a\r\nbrick pavement from the city to the home. This road was completed to the\r\ncity limits in 1904. Since that time the city has extended its pavement\r\nso that now there is a pavement road all the way from the home to the\r\nbusiness district of Atchison.\r\n\r\nThe two latest improvements of great value to the home are, first the\r\nconnecting up of the home with the Atchison Water Company, so that now\r\nwe receive a supply of water adequate for all purposes. This was done in\r\n1913 and 1914. Previous to that time water had been obtained from\r\nvarious sources and the supply was always poor in quality and very\r\ninadequate in quantity. This apparently settles the question of water,\r\nso far as this institution is concerned, and we now have a plentiful\r\nsupply of the purest of water. Second: From the very first beginning of\r\nthe home the question of sewage disposal has been one of great\r\ndifficulty and a source of much annoyance and discomfort to those around\r\nabout, particularly the neighboring farmers. For years the sewage of the\r\ninstitution flowed out through the pasture land and fields of our\r\nneighbors, and various attempts to build sewage disposal plants were\r\nmade by the board of control and others who had charge of the State\r\ninstitutions, but with little or no success. At the present time we are\r\nengaged in connecting up the institution with the city sewer system at a\r\ncost of approximately $6,000.\r\n\r\nThe original cost of the land occupied by the State Orphans’ Home, and\r\npurchased from J. P. Brown, as hereinbefore mentioned, was $16,000.\r\n\r\nNo institution in this State occupies a more beautiful and sightly\r\nlocation. It is situated at an elevation of 275 feet above the Missouri\r\nriver, and overlooking the winding course of that stream for miles, with\r\nthe city of Atchison at its feet and with the view north and west\r\nunobstructed for miles, it is the wonder and admiration of all who\r\nbehold it. It is impossible for me to state exactly or to ascertain\r\nexactly the cost of the institution, properly known as the State\r\nOrphans’ Home, but it is approximately in the neighborhood of $300,000.\r\n\r\nThe first superintendent was John Pierson; his wife, Mrs. M. A. Pierson,\r\nwas his matron, and the celebrated Dr. Eva Harding, now a physician,\r\nlocated in Topeka, and running for the Democratic nomination for\r\nCongress in the First district, was his physician. Mr. Pierson was not\r\nvery long in this office. The records do not show just how long, but he\r\nwas succeeded by Charles E. Faulkner, who is now serving as\r\nsuperintendent of the Washburn Memorial Orphans’ Asylum, at Minneapolis,\r\nMinn. It was during Faulkner’s administration that most of the\r\nimprovements heretofore noted were made. Faulkner was succeeded by C. A.\r\nWoodworth in 1898 and served but two years, when H. H. Young was\r\nappointed. He served but a short time and was succeeded by E. L. Hillis,\r\nwho held the office until the time of his resignation, April 1, 1907,\r\nbecause of ill health. Mr. Hillis was succeeded by E. C. Willis, of\r\nNewton, Kan., on April 10, 1907, who remained superintendent until he\r\nwas succeeded by Mrs. E. K. Burnes on the first day of September, 1913.\r\nMrs. Burnes held the place for two years, being succeeded by E. C.\r\nWillis on the first of September, 1915, who is still the superintendent\r\nat the present time.\r\n\r\nMore than 6,000 have been inmates of the home at sometime or another,\r\nand of the 6,000 only 200 are here at the present time. All of the\r\nothers who are still living are out in the world and doing for\r\nthemselves like other people with various degrees of success. Some of\r\nthem are doing well; others exceedingly well, and are occupying good\r\npositions, or are in business for themselves.\r\n\r\n                            Very sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                       EDWARD C. WILLIS,\r\n                                                       Superintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ATCHISON PUBLIC LIBRARY.\r\n\r\nMajor W. W. Downs was the promoter of the association. He was at Kansas\r\nin the spring of 1879 and opened its doors to the public November 17 of\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nHe was at that time superintendent of the Central Branch railroad and\r\nrealized the need of reading and amusement rooms for the young men in\r\nthis city. He succeeded in interesting a number of influential Atchison\r\nwomen in the work and promised a generous personal donation and the\r\ncoöperation of the various railroads centering here.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate that before the doors of the library swung open the\r\nCentral Branch changed officials. In spite of this discouragement the\r\nAtchison ladies continued to work, and since its organization it has\r\nalways been managed by a board of fifteen women.\r\n\r\nFunds are raised by the sale of membership and donations and a small\r\nmonthly stipend from the city. J. P. Pomeroy subsequently made a\r\nsplendid donation, amounting to $10,000, and later on, A. J. Harwi\r\ncontributed a like amount for the support of this institution. It now\r\nhas almost 11,000 books on its shelves besides hundreds of magazines and\r\npamphlets.\r\n\r\nMrs. Leontine Scofield was appointed librarian in January, 1883, and has\r\nheld that position from that time until 1916 uninterruptedly. She has\r\nendeared herself to the thousands of patrons who have visited this\r\ninstitution, and her familiarity with the place and her fidelity to the\r\nwork especially fits her for this important place.\r\n\r\nThe following Atchison ladies are the officers of the association in\r\n1916: Mrs. W. W. Guthrie, president; Mrs. F. E. Harwi, vice-president;\r\nMrs. W. S. Beitzel, recording secretary; Miss Effie E. Symns,\r\ncorresponding secretary; Mrs. Fannie W. Linley, treasurer. In addition\r\nto these ladies the following are directresses: Miss Nellie Allen, Mrs.\r\nR. F. Clark, Mrs. L. R. Seaton, Mrs. G. W. Glick, Mrs. E. S. Wills, Mrs.\r\nW. H. Schulze, Mrs. J. M. Challiss, Mrs. D. C. Newcomb, and Miss Mary\r\nLukens. Mrs. J. J. Ingalls is an honorary directress of the association.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ATCHISON HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to found a hospital in the city of Atchison originated\r\nin 1884, and after a general meeting for organization a board was\r\nappointed which purchased and re-constructed a building situated on\r\nSouth Seventh street between U and V, and the institution was open to\r\nthe public May 20 of that year.\r\n\r\nThe following named Atchison ladies were prominently identified with the\r\nmovement that was responsible for the building of the first hospital in\r\nAtchison: Mrs. A. A. Carey, who was the first president of the\r\nassociation; Mrs. J. J. Berry, Mrs. W. W. Campbell, Mrs. E. A. Mize,\r\nMrs. D. P. Blish, Mrs. C. B. Singleton, Mrs. J. J. Ingalls, and Mrs. C.\r\nS. Osborn.\r\n\r\nAfter five years of activity this building as a hospital was closed\r\nthrough lack of support and the misapprehension of the purpose of a\r\nhospital on the part of the community.\r\n\r\nFrom about 1889 until 1912 the hospital necessities of Atchison were\r\nprovided by private institutions and cases were sent outside of the\r\ncity, but in the fall of 1912 the need for a hospital within the city\r\nhad become very apparent, and as a result the following public spirited\r\ncitizens of the city associated themselves together for the purpose of\r\nbuilding a modern hospital: W. P. Waggener, president; R. W. Ramsay,\r\nvice-president; Otis E. Gray, secretary; Joseph M. Schott, treasurer.\r\nThe directors with the above officers were: Frank Harwi, T. M. Walker\r\nand L. R. Seaton. They instituted a campaign for the purpose of raising\r\n$50,000 to purchase a site and construct and equip a building for a\r\ngeneral hospital.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was to a very large degree successful, sufficient money\r\nbeing raised in this initial effort to warrant the directors in\r\npurchasing a site, the square block situated on North Second street\r\nbetween N and O streets, where a fire-proof building was constructed to\r\naccommodate thirty-five patients with a maximum capacity of fifty. The\r\nbuilding is equipped with the most modern appliances for hospital\r\nactivities. The operating room was modeled and equipped after the\r\nsuggestion of the most celebrated surgeons in the country, and since the\r\nopening of the hospital to receive patients in July, 1914, its success\r\nhas been assured and its need demonstrated. It possesses appliances and\r\nequipment conservatively valued at $65,000.\r\n\r\nThe present board of directors are: W. P. Waggener, president; Frank E.\r\nHarwi, vice-president; O. E. Gray, secretary; Joseph M. Schott,\r\ntreasurer. Directors: R. W. Ramsay, H. E. Muchnic, Eugene Howe and Leo\r\nNusbaum.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this institution is to take care of the sick and injured\r\nof the community without distinction of race, color or creed. Those who\r\ncan afford to pay are expected to pay the fees of the institution. No\r\none is refused attendance by reason of his or her inability to pay for\r\nsuch service. The biological and X-Ray laboratories are among the best\r\nequipped in the State and these laboratories with their equipment, like\r\nmost of the furnishings and equipment of the hospital, are memorials of\r\nthe former residents of Atchison county.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MASONIC TEMPLE.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent new home for the Masonic orders of Atchison is a three-\r\nstory structure of re-inforced concrete fire-proof construction with\r\nbasement. It is built of gray Brazil, Indiana, vitrified brick and\r\ntrimmed with ocean colored terra cotta. The first floor is a store room\r\nand on the second floor there are a number of offices and the banquet\r\nhall with kitchen facilities. The third floor is used exclusively for\r\nMasonic purposes, and in the rear portion of the third floor is a\r\nmezzanine floor with fire-proof lockers. The lodge room is embellished\r\nwith an ornamental plaster cornice and with Scagliola columns and\r\npilasters. The ceiling is circular with a large dome, and the memorial\r\nroom is finished with ornamental plastering in elaborate Egyptian\r\ndesign. The total cost of this building with furniture and equipment was\r\nclose to $60,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Masonic Temple, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n                         SOCIETIES AND LODGES.\r\n\r\n  ATCHISON COUNTY PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION—BENEVOLENT AND PROTECTIVE ORDER\r\n      OF ELKS—FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES—OTHER SECRET SOCIETIES—CATHOLIC\r\n      SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest county organizations among the farmers is the\r\nAtchison County Protective Association. It had its origin in a vigilance\r\ncommittee which was organized at Good Intent and Shannon, in 1883. For\r\nthree years this committee operated as a vigilance committee and was\r\norganized under the Central Protective Association, August 31, 1886, by\r\nWilliam Conners, of Winthrop, Mo. L. P. Dubois, concerning whom a\r\nbiographical sketch appears in another part of this history, was the\r\nfirst president of the Good Intent lodge, and W. H. Smith was the first\r\nsecretary. Hon. T. J. Emlen, county treasurer of this county, was the\r\nfirst treasurer of Shannon Hill lodge, and J. I. Holmes was the first\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\nThe first work that was done by the consolidated lodges was in running\r\ndown a thief who stole a team of horses from the late Rolla Streeper.\r\nMembers of both lodges were taxed $10 each to defray the expense of the\r\nchase. J. H. Barry was sheriff of the county at that time and captured\r\nthe thief in Nebraska.\r\n\r\nFollowing this capture the lodges decided that the expense was too great\r\nto be borne by them alone and so the Atchison County Protective\r\nAssociation was formed in the spring of 1889. The first president was C.\r\nS. Prim, and the second president was Hon. W. T. Bland, third president\r\nwas Elias Graves. W. H. Bush was the fourth president, and he held\r\noffice for ten years and was one of the most popular, tactful and\r\nconscientious officials the association ever had. Will Dooley, of the\r\nGood Intent lodge, was president of the association in 1916, and no\r\nbetter man ever filled the position. The Hon. Edward Iverson, ex-county\r\nclerk, and now cashier of the Exchange State Bank, at Atchison, has been\r\nsecretary of the association since 1901. The association has now a\r\nmembership of 1,500 and with twenty-five lodges, and is affiliated with\r\nthe Central Protective Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n                BENEVOLENT AND PROTECTIVE ORDER OF ELKS.\r\n\r\nThis lodge was organized January 17, 1901, with 150 charter members. W.\r\nT. Bland, for many years district judge of this county, was elected the\r\nfirst exalted ruler. The lodge occupied temporary quarters for a number\r\nof years, and erected its present building at a cost of $20,000 and\r\ndedicated it in 1907. The present membership of the Elk’s lodge is 326,\r\nand the names of the past exalted rulers, in addition to W. T. Bland,\r\nare as follows: Charles Linley, T. S. Young, J. M. Challiss, James W.\r\nOrr, W. S. Washer, Fred Giddings, W. P. Waggener, B. W. Vickery, W. D.\r\nHarburger, Charles A. Brown, G. W. Myers, H. B. Bilimek, and Walter E.\r\nBrown, whose term expires March 31, 1916.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Elks Club House, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n          ATCHISON AERIE, NO. 173, FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES.\r\n\r\nThe Atchison Aerie, No. 173, of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, was\r\ninstituted on October 3, 1901. The officers in 1916 are as follows: Past\r\nworthy president, Owen Grady; worthy president, John V. Smith; worthy\r\nvice-president, Fred Rambke; worthy chaplain, F. E. Kaaz; treasurer, L.\r\nM.

BUCHANAN—\r\n      EUGENE L. BELL—CHARLES INGRAM—CHARLES J. FERGUSON—HENRY DICKEY—DR.\r\n      FRANK ADRIAN PEARL, M. D.—DR. W. W. CALDWELL, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the African race in Atchison county makes an appeal to the\r\nthoughtful and intelligent student of history. It is not a mere\r\nplatitude to say that the negro has made marvelous progress in many\r\nlines, and not the least striking illustration of this assertion is to\r\npoint to what he has accomplished in this county under circumstances\r\nthat have not been altogether propitious. The record of African bondage\r\nhere is not voluminous, but it is sufficient upon which to base a story\r\nof his development. As early as 1856 a reference to slavery in Atchison\r\ncounty is found in the _Squatter Sovereign_, which on September 16 of\r\nthat year contained the following advertisement:\r\n\r\n                              $500 REWARD.\r\n\r\n  Ran away from the subscribers on the night of September 9, two negro\r\n  boys, Ned and Harrison.\r\n\r\n  Ned is about eighteen years old, stout and well built, about five\r\n  feet, eight inches high, and weighs about 170 pounds. At the time of\r\n  his leaving was dressed in a brown velvet coat.\r\n\r\n  Harrison is a bright mulatto, about five feet, four inches high,\r\n  weighs about 120 pounds, is about sixteen years old, and was rather\r\n  shabbily dressed.\r\n\r\n  Said negroes took with them two horses.\r\n\r\n  One black, six years old, branded H on left hip, quite thin, about\r\n  fifteen and one-half hands high.\r\n\r\n  One claybank, dark mane and tail, rather bony, six years old, about\r\n  fifteen and one-half hands high, paces.\r\n\r\n  Five hundred dollars reward will be given for the apprehension and\r\n  safe return of the negroes, or $250 for the recovery of either of\r\n  the negroes and horses.\r\n\r\n                                                      A. J. FREDERICK,\r\n                                                      R. H. CABELL.\r\n\r\n  Atchison, K. T.\r\n\r\nA search of the files of the _Squatter Sovereign_ fails to disclose the\r\nsequel to this advertisement. Whether or not “Ned and Harrison” were\r\nsubsequently apprehended and the reward paid must be left to the\r\nimagination, but doubtless they were among the four million black men\r\nfrom whose limbs, a few years later, Abraham Lincoln struck the\r\nshackles, and whose descendants this day are breathing the pure air of\r\nfreedom. There is no definite record of the number of slaves in Atchison\r\ncounty at the time the advertisement in the _Squatter Sovereign_\r\nappeared. When the first census was taken in 1855 no counties had been\r\nestablished and the territory in Atchison county was included in the\r\nfifteenth election district. This census provided for the enumeration of\r\nthe slaves in the territory, and as far as can be determined, the\r\nfollowing men in and around Atchison were slave owners: D. A. N. Glover,\r\nthree; W. M. Size, five; John Samuel, one; R. A. Walker, one; Charles\r\nEcher, three; S. F. Raz, three; and Grafton Thomasson, the sawmill man,\r\nof Atchison, owned three, one of whom drowned herself in the Missouri\r\nriver, which fatality was the direct cause of the famous Pardee Butler\r\nincident. It is a far cry from “Ned and Harrison” to Prior Dickey and\r\nHenry Buchanan, successful farmers of Walnut township, and it will be\r\nthe object of this chapter to show how far that cry is, by tracing\r\nsomewhat intimately the lives and careers of Dickey and Buchanan, and\r\nother leading negroes of the Mills neighborhood.\r\n\r\nPrior Dickey was born in Barren county, Kentucky, March 9, 1861, a son\r\nof Jackson and Edith Dickey, the father a native of West Virginia, and\r\nthe mother of Kentucky. The first eighteen years of his life were spent\r\nin Kentucky, and in 1879 he came to Kansas, and his first employment was\r\nin a rock quarry at Millbrook, Graham county. He possessed $3.75 when he\r\nlanded in this town. He helped build sod houses, and in fact turned his\r\nhand at anything that offered for his board and lodging. During the\r\nspring of 1880 he walked from Millbrook to Concordia, a distance of 200\r\nmiles, in search of work. He was accompanied by a friend, Calvin\r\nTrotter, and their joint capital was $1.25. After reaching Concordia,\r\nand also having gone without food for two days, he secured work with a\r\nrailroad construction crew, and was sent from Concordia to Atchison, and\r\nthence to Rich Hill, Mo., and later to Texas, where he worked on the\r\nextension of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas railway. When this work was\r\nfinished he started for Kansas, and wishing to save his money stowed\r\nhimself in a box car. While the train was at a standstill in a Texas\r\ntown, a white man knocked on the door, demanding admittance. Prior was\r\nscared, and stealing out of the opposite door, started to run. The white\r\nman called out, “Stop, neighbor,” and Prior stopped. They became\r\nfriends, and came north together in the box car. On arriving at Ft.\r\nScott, Prior gave his white friend $1, fed him at a restaurant, and sent\r\nhim on his way. From Ft. Scott he came to Atchison, and later was\r\nemployed in railroad construction work of various kinds in Nebraska, on\r\nthe Central Branch railroad in Kansas, the Wabash in Missouri, and\r\nelsewhere. In 1833 he secured his first employment on a farm, a field of\r\nendeavor in which he has since made a signal success. From ten dollars a\r\nmonth to twenty-one dollars, with board and lodging, was his wage. Prior\r\npossessed a spirit of thrift and saved his wages. In 1885, while working\r\nfor Medad Harvey, in Grasshopper township, Atchison county, he bought\r\nhis first forty acres. On this place he put his father and mother,\r\nbringing them from Kentucky. They lived here until their deaths, that of\r\nthe father, in 1895, and the mother in 1911. Prior’s example in caring\r\nfor his aged parents, even refusing to marry on account of attendance on\r\nhis mother, is worthy of emulation. Three years after his first purchase\r\nof land he bought his second forty, a year later a third forty, then an\r\neighty, and later from John J. Ingalls, he bought a 160 acre tract. He\r\nis also the owner of a 160 acre farm in Oklahoma, and his various\r\nholdings total over 500 acres. He is a capable and industrious\r\nagriculturist, employs modern methods, is in close touch with the\r\nadvancement in scientific farming, and is a successful breeder of high\r\ngrade cattle and hogs. His herd of grade Herefords is the equal of any\r\nin the county and numbers over fifty head. His property is well improved\r\nand well kept. He is a stockholder in the State Bank of Potter and\r\nconceded to be no mean financier. He is a stanch Republican and states\r\n“not a black man in the United States can conscientiously be anything\r\nbut a Republican.” He cast his first vote in Graham county in the first\r\nelection held in that county after its organization. He is a Mason and a\r\nBaptist. A sister and her children comprise his household. Possessed of\r\nambition to succeed and gain an assured position in his adopted State,\r\nof untiring energy, intelligence and the quality of thrift, Prior Dickey\r\nhas developed into a citizen who is worth while.\r\n\r\nHenry C. Buchanan was born in Lincoln county, Kentucky, on April 8,\r\n1844. His father was a slave, owned by Dr. Thomas Montgomery, and named\r\nMartin Montgomery, and his mother was Violet Shanks, a slave girl, owned\r\nby Archie Shanks. Their son was born on the Shanks plantation. Following\r\nthe death of Archie Shanks, his daughter, Sarah, inherited the boy,\r\nHenry, along with thirty other slaves. She afterward married a man by\r\nthe name of Buchanan, and this family name was given the boy. He grew to\r\nyoung manhood on the Buchanan plantation, and was given fair treatment,\r\nbut not any schooling. In 1864 he left the plantation and enlisted in\r\nthe Fifth United States cavalry, at Camp Wilson, on the Kentucky river.\r\nHe served about twenty-two months and was mustered out at Little Rock,\r\nArk. He then returned to the old plantation in Kentucky, and found it\r\nhad been made a Government post. He was fairly well posted on farming,\r\nas he had been one of the best field hands on the Buchanan plantation,\r\nand this fact being known to the land owners of the neighborhood, he had\r\nno difficulty in leasing a portion of the old plantation. A brother-in-\r\nlaw was associated with him in this venture, but Henry was the manager.\r\nHe later leased land in the adjoining county. His farming was\r\nprofitable, and he saved his money, eventually accumulating enough\r\ncapital to engage in the general merchandise business in Lancaster, Ky.,\r\non a small scale. In 1881 he concluded to go west, and chose Atchison\r\nKan., as his place of location. He arrived here at the time of the great\r\nflood, and shortly afterward opened a grocery and produce store on Fifth\r\nstreet. He continued in this business until 1891, when he sold out, and\r\nwith the proceeds bought 100 acres of land in Walnut township. This\r\nproperty he improved, and as the years have passed he has added to the\r\nacreage, until now he owns 400 acres. The property is well improved,\r\nwell kept and well farmed. He was married in 1878 to Belle Hogans, of\r\nGarritt county, Kentucky, who died in 1899. Handicapped by the lack of\r\neducation, he has spared no reasonable expense in the matter of\r\neducating his children, and his sons are now carrying forward their\r\nfather’s farm enterprise along modern lines, and are well educated,\r\nintelligent members of the community. A deceased daughter, Luella B.,\r\ngraduated from the Atchison county high school, at Effingham. Henry\r\nBuchanan has always been a Republican. He has served as precinct\r\ncommitteeman, and as a member of the election board at several\r\nelections, and also as judge of election. He is a member of the Baptist\r\nchurch, and has been a member of the board of trustees of his local\r\nchurch for many years. Measured from the standpoint of a man who has\r\ndone the things which have come to his hand from time to time, he has\r\ndone those things well. He has assisted in the development of the\r\ncounty’s agricultural resources, has been thrifty, and has gained the\r\nrespect and esteem of the residents of his township and county.\r\n\r\nEugene L. Bell, prosperous farmer, Walnut township, was born at Oak\r\nMills, Kan., July 28, 1875, a son of Joseph and Sydney (King) Bell,\r\nnatives of Missouri and Kentucky, respectively. Joseph Bell, the father,\r\nwas born in October, 1844, in Platte county, Missouri, of slave\r\nparentage. He lived in Missouri until 1863, and then located in\r\nLeavenworth, Kan., where he joined the United States army, becoming a\r\nmember of Company G, Seventy-ninth regiment, United States Colorado\r\ninfantry. He served until the close of the Civil war, taking part in\r\nfourteen battles. After the war he married Miss Sydney King at\r\nLeavenworth, Kan. In 1872 he removed to Oak Mills, Atchison county, and\r\nsettled on a farm in Walnut township. He was one of the pioneers of this\r\nsettlement and developed a fine farm. Mr. Bell took an active part in\r\nmatters pertaining to the betterment of his community and was an\r\nexemplary citizen. Many of the noted men of his day in Kansas were his\r\nwarm and steadfast friends. Mr. and Mrs. Bell were the parents of nine\r\nchildren, six of whom were reared to maturity: Eugene L., the subject of\r\nthis review; Mrs. Birdie Norman, of Omaha, Neb.; Mrs. T. C. Brown, and\r\nMiss Pearlie Bell, of Chicago, Ill.; Humphrey Bell, of Pittsburgh, Pa.;\r\nand Mead Bell, of Cleveland, Ohio. Joseph Bell died May 30, 1914. Mrs.\r\nBell died April 18, 1903. Like her husband, she ran away from slavery to\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\nEugene L. spent his boyhood days assisting his father in cultivating the\r\nhome farm, and managed to attend school about two and one-half months\r\nout of the year until he attained the age of nineteen years. He then\r\nbegan to hustle for himself and completed a three years’ course in the\r\nAtchison county high school at Effingham. Ambition and a desire to\r\neducate himself led him to make sacrifices in order to prepare himself\r\nto better cope with the struggle for a livelihood. The priceless boon of\r\nan education was his after considerable effort, and he graduated from\r\nthe county high school in 1896. He then returned to the avocation of\r\nfarmer and rented land in Walnut township, which he cultivated for some\r\nyears. Mr. Bell is the owner of a fine farm in Walnut township.\r\n\r\nHe was married December 26, 1901, to Miss Mamie Churchhill, of Monrovia,\r\nKan., a native of Hardin county, Kentucky. They settled in Atchison,\r\nKan., and lived there three years after this marriage. Mr. Bell then\r\nmoved to Walnut township and taught school for two terms in District No.\r\n20. He then bought forty acres of land, on which he has since made his\r\nhome. Seven children have been born to Mr. and Mrs. Bell: Inez, Orville,\r\nEugene, Leslie, Jr., Justin, Irene, Pearlie, Ruthanna. Mrs. Bell died\r\nDecember 7, 1912.\r\n\r\nMr. Bell has been the local newspaper correspondent of his neighborhood\r\nfor several years and has a decided literary talent. For the past\r\neighteen years he has been connected with school district No. 20 in the\r\ncapacity of teacher and school trustee. He is a progressive Republican\r\nin his political affiliations, and has been honored by his party. On May\r\n27, 1915, he was appointed by Governor Capper as a member of the board\r\nof trustees of Quindaro University, Kansas, and also received a\r\ncomplimentary appointment to attend the Farmers’ Congress as a negro\r\ndelegate, held at the Panama Exposition at San Francisco. He is a member\r\nof the Methodist Episcopal church of Atchison, and has been a member of\r\nthe Masonic fraternity for the past fifteen years. Mr. Bell has taken a\r\nprominent part in the educational and civic life of Atchison county. He\r\nhas served as a delegate to county and State conventions of his party,\r\nand filled the position of doorkeeper and sergeant-at-arms in the house\r\nof representatives at Topeka. His newspaper experience includes a term\r\nof employment in the printing department of the _Omaha Bee_ when\r\nnineteen years old, where he learned typesetting, going from there to\r\nChicago and attending the World’s Fair. After this experience he\r\nreturned home with the intention of securing an education and succeeded.\r\nMr. Bell is one of the well respected citizens of his community, and is\r\none of the recognized leaders of his race in Kansas. His father, Joseph\r\nBell, was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic, Scott Post, of\r\nHydro, Okla., whither he removed in 1900.\r\n\r\nCharles Ingram, a well known farmer, of Walnut township, whose\r\nagricultural plant is located four miles distant from the town of\r\nPotter, Kan., consisting of 160 acres of good land, is a native of the\r\nSouthland. He was born in 1855, a son of Hart and Vinia Ingram, both of\r\nwhom were born and reared in Tennessee. Just previous, or some years\r\nbefore the opening of the Civil war, his parents left Tennessee and came\r\nto Buchanan county, Missouri, as chattels of Jesse Ingram. The Ingram\r\nfarm was located about four miles distant from St. Joseph, Mo. Here they\r\ntoiled in the fields of the master and owner until given their freedom\r\nby Mr. Ingram near the end of the Civil war. The owner, on setting his\r\nslaves free, told them to go out and hustle for themselves. Hart Ingram\r\nand his family came to Kansas and lived during their first winter here\r\nin Atchison. He then located on a farm in Mt. Pleasant township, and\r\nworked for Mr. Speck for five years. He then rented land of John King\r\nfor one year, after which he invested his savings in forty acres of land\r\nin Walnut township, upon which he resided until his demise.\r\n\r\nAs a youth Charles had no opportunity to acquire an education, and after\r\nhis marriage in 1880 he rented land for several years, and eventually\r\nsaved enough money to make a payment on forty acres of farm lands. He\r\nimmediately made his home on his purchase and has added to his\r\npossessions until he is now the owner of 160 acres of excellent farm\r\nland, with good, comfortable dwelling and improvements. Charles Ingram\r\nwas married in 1880 to Margarette Farner, of Atchison county. Five\r\nchildren have blessed this marriage, who are all receiving the benefits\r\nof a good school education by their ambitious parents.\r\n\r\nMr. Ingram is a Republican in politics, and is a member of the Baptist\r\nchurch. He is a man of high and strong character, which has been\r\ndeveloped in the stern and exacting school of adversity. Mr. Ingram has\r\nseen the time when he was unable to borrow even twenty-five dollars, and\r\nhis credit is now good for as much as $2,500, should he desire it. One\r\nof his daughters, Grace, is a graduate of the Atchison county high\r\nschool at Effingham, and the others have been given similar opportunity.\r\nGrace Ingram taught school in Atchison county before her marriage. Mr.\r\nIngram is a striking example of the progress which his race has made\r\nsince the negroes have been freed from bondage.\r\n\r\nCharles J. Ferguson, farmer, of Oak Mills, Kan., was born in Platte\r\ncounty, Missouri, in April 1881, a son of Daniel and Sarah (Williams)\r\nFerguson, the former a native of Kentucky, and the latter a native of\r\nMissouri. The parents of Charles came to Kansas from Missouri in 1881,\r\nand settled on a small farm of twenty acres, which Daniel bought with\r\nhis savings, and still owns. Charles attended school in District No. 20,\r\nand was reared on the parental farm. After his marriage in 1900 he began\r\ndoing things for himself and has become the owner of 100 acres of fine\r\nfarm lands, overlooking Bean Lake, and located in Walnut township. Mr.\r\nFerguson has attained to his comfortable position of affluence by\r\nindustry, economy, and good financial management, and began his career\r\nwith practically nothing. He was the first man in Walnut township to\r\nship a carload of wheat, and others have since followed his example. He\r\nshipped his first carload of wheat in 1910 and has become noted as a\r\ngrower of small grain, having raised 1,690 bushels of wheat in 1914, and\r\nraises on an average over 1,200 bushels annually. He was married March\r\n7, 1900, to Eliza, a daughter of H. C. Buchanan, and is the father of\r\nthe following children: Granville F., born December 19, 1900; Sarah,\r\nborn March 1, 1902; Sheffield, born January 12, 1905; Rothschild, born\r\nSeptember 8, 1908; Luella, born June 17, 1910: Decina, born May 31,\r\n1912.\r\n\r\nMr. Ferguson is a Republican in politics and has taken an active and\r\ninfluential part in the affairs of his party in Atchison county. He was\r\nelected a member of the county central committee in 1908, and has held\r\nthis position since that time. He is treasurer of the school board of\r\nDistrict No. 20 of his township. He is a member of the Knights of Tabor,\r\nof Atchison, and is well thought of and highly respected by all who know\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHenry Dickey, farmer, of Walnut township, was born February 24, 1850, in\r\nBarron county, Kentucky. He was a son of Jackson and Edith Dickey, who\r\nwere slaves until freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. After the\r\nCivil war, which resulted in the Dickeys becoming freemen, the parents\r\nremained in Kentucky until 1884. Henry was at that time working on a\r\nfarm in Kentucky for fifty cents a day, and he wished to better his\r\ncondition and that of his parents. Accordingly, he came to Kansas in\r\nsearch of a location, and found it in Atchison county. After his\r\nbrother, Prior Dickey, joined him in this county, he and Prior pooled\r\ntheir interests and invested in farm lands until they now own over 500\r\nacres of land in partnership. They also own forty head of fine Hereford\r\ncattle, seven-eighths pure bred stock.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickey was married February 23, 1903, to Celia Kerford, a daughter\r\nof Abraham Kerford, a well known colored family of Atchison county. The\r\nKerfords came from the home county of Abraham Lincoln, in Kentucky. One\r\nchild has been born to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dickey, Sarah E., born\r\nSeptember 24, 1906.\r\n\r\nPolitically, Mr. Dickey is allied with the Republican party, and has\r\nserved as a member of the school board of his district. He and his wife\r\nare members of the Baptist church. Mrs. Dickey is affiliated with the\r\nTrue Eleven lodge of Atchison. Mr. Dickey is one of the most influential\r\nand successful members of the negro race in Kansas, and is considered as\r\none of the industrious and highly successful agriculturists and live\r\nstock men of Atchison county.\r\n\r\nDr. Frank Adrian Pearl, M. D., Atchison, Kan., is one of the self-made\r\nmen of the present generation. He was born September 2, 1886, in the\r\ncity of Atchison, a son of Ryes and Sarah J. Pearl, the former of whom\r\nwas a native of Missouri, and removed to Atchison, Kan., shortly after\r\nthe close of the Civil war. He lived in Atchison until 1888, and then\r\nmoved to Butte, Mont., where he lived until his demise. After his demise\r\nthe widow married a man named Davis.\r\n\r\nFrank A. was reared to young manhood in Butte, and attended the public\r\nand high school of his home city, afterwards pursuing a course in\r\nbusiness college. When yet a boy he began to work for himself and early\r\nbecame self-reliant in doing any and all kinds of honest labor. In 1905\r\nand 1906 he studied in the Topeka Educational Institute, and supported\r\nhimself by hard work while studying in this institution. He then entered\r\nHoward Medical College, of Washington, D. C., and graduated from this\r\nschool in 1912. After his graduation Dr. Pearl located in Kansas City,\r\nand for one and one-half years served as interne in the General Hospital\r\nof Kansas City. He located in Atchison in August of 1914, and has built\r\nup an excellent practice among the people of his race, and has made a\r\nname for himself as a skilled and well educated physician. Dr. Pearl is\r\na member of the County Medical Society, the Tri-State Medical\r\nAssociation, embracing Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and the Kansas\r\nMedical Society. He is an independent in politics, and is a member of\r\nthe Methodist Episcopal church. Dr. Pearl is fraternally allied with the\r\nOdd Fellows, the United Brotherhood of Freemen, and the Knights of\r\nTabor. He is well educated, courteous, a great student, and is fast\r\nmaking a place for himself in his chosen profession.\r\n\r\nDr. W. W. Caldwell, M. D., of Atchison, Kan., was born in Nashville,\r\nTenn., in 1877, a son of Jefferson and Elizabeth (Bell) Caldwell. His\r\nmother was a native of Louisiana and had the entire support of ten\r\nchildren thrown upon her after the removal of the family to Topeka,\r\nKan., in 1880. Mrs. Caldwell was a capable woman of more than ordinary\r\nability, thoroughly untutored, but possessed of a strong character, she\r\ndetermined that her children should be fitted to cope with the battle of\r\nlife with well trained minds. She early installed into the minds of her\r\nchildren those qualities of character which have produced great men. She\r\npossessed an iron constitution and an unconquerable will which enabled\r\nher to put in long hours each day at the wash-tub in order to gain the\r\nmeans of feeding the hungry mouths of her children. She also taught each\r\nof her offspring to become self-supporting as soon as they were able and\r\nencouraged them to strike out for themselves. An instance of her nature\r\nis shown in an occurrence in the life of Dr. Caldwell: “When the boy was\r\nfourteen years of age he made his way to St. Louis, via ‘the side-door\r\nPullman’ route. He did not like the appearance of things in St. Louis,\r\nand returned to the safer haven of his home in Topeka, only to be chided\r\nby his mother for his inability to stay away from home and make his own\r\nway in the world as she desired him to do.” The night following his\r\nreturn he again left home and did not return until time for school to\r\nre-open in the fall, with money in his pocket which would suffice to\r\ncarry him through the winter. The mother was an expert laundress and\r\nkept all of her children in school as long as they desired to go. Two of\r\nher daughters nearly finished the high school course in Topeka, but Dr.\r\nCaldwell was the only child of the family to acquire a collegiate\r\neducation and a professional training.\r\n\r\nHe attended both the public and high schools of Topeka and afterwards\r\nstudied for three years in the State Normal school at Topeka, and was\r\ngranted a life teacher’s certificate. While at college Dr. Caldwell made\r\na great reputation as a runner and football player, serving as halfback\r\non the State Normal football team. He acquired his education practically\r\nby his own efforts, encouraged by his ambitious mother. In 1892, when he\r\nwas fourteen years of age, he made his first trip away from home, to St.\r\nLouis, but returned home after one month’s stay in that city. His mother\r\nhaving ridiculed him for coming home, he caught the Rock Island flyer\r\nout of Topeka that night and rode part of the way to Denver. After a\r\nthrilling experience covering a period of two weeks, he finally arrived\r\nat the western city, just as he started, without funds, but with the\r\ndesire to obtain employment. He worked in Denver at any honest\r\nemployment he could obtain, such as shining shoes, laying concrete,\r\nhotel porter, and similar jobs. His hardships were many, but he was\r\neventually well repaid for his early struggles. One place which he held\r\nas porter in a barber shop enabled him to lay by a considerable sum of\r\nmoney each week. He was paid ten cents per shine and allowed to keep the\r\nmoney thus earned, and saved eight dollars during his first week. He\r\nworked for this shop for three successive summers, and made it a rule to\r\nlay by eight dollars each week. When it came time for school to open he\r\nwould “beat” his way back to Topeka via the overland trains and study\r\nduring the winter and spring months, and would then again make his way\r\nto Denver in time for employment. Thirty-five dollars saved usually\r\nsufficed to pay his expenses during the winter months while in school,\r\nand he would sometimes make his way home with $300 in his pocket. He\r\nkept up this plan of working and studying until he had completed his\r\nmedical course, entering medical college in 1902, and graduating\r\ntherefrom in 1906. After practicing in Topeka for one and one-half years\r\nhe went to Independence, Kan., but remained there only seven months. In\r\n1908 Dr. Caldwell came to Atchison and opened an office for general\r\nmedical practice. He has made a great success in his noble profession,\r\nand has attained to a high position of leadership among the members of\r\nthe Afro-American race.\r\n\r\nDr. Caldwell was married in 1906 to Araminta Beck, a native of Wamegoa\r\ncounty, Kansas, and to this union have been born children, as follows:\r\nGeorgia, born in 1909; Elizabeth, born in 1911; Elnora, born in 1908.\r\nThe mother of these children was born in Kansas City August 20, 1880, a\r\ndaughter of Leonardo Beck, a stone cutter by trade. Her mother, Mrs.\r\nGeorgia Beck, was one of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers, who sang in\r\npublic recitals in many cities of the United States and in England. They\r\nsang in the cause of education, the money earned by the recitals going\r\nto defray the expenses of erecting the $100,000 Jubilee Hall at Fisk\r\nUniversity, Nashville, Tenn. An uncle of Mrs. Caldwell, Col. James L.\r\nBeck, commanded the Twenty-third regiment of colored Kansas volunteers\r\nwhich served in Cuba during the Spanish-American war. Mrs. Caldwell is a\r\nwell educated lady and is a graduate of the Wamego, Kansas, high school,\r\nand graduated from Kansas University before she attained the age of\r\ntwenty years. She is a member of the Eastern Star lodge of Topeka, in\r\nwhich city she taught school for seven years, later teaching one year in\r\nSpringfield, Mo.\r\n\r\nDr. Caldwell is a member of the Masonic fraternity of Topeka, and is a\r\nphysician for the Knights of Tabor lodge of Atchison. He is a member of\r\nEbenezer Baptist Church, and is a Republican in politics. In 1912 he\r\nreceived the degree of Bachelor of Arts from the State Normal at\r\nEmporia, Kan. On July 30, 1915, Governor Capper appointed the Doctor a\r\ndelegate to the National Negro Educational Congress, held at Chicago,\r\nfrom August 16 to August 21, inclusive. In 1914 he was presented with a\r\nwalnut gavel by the Inter-State Literary Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n                               OFFICIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  COUNTY—TOWNSHIP AND SCHOOL OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n          County Clerk—C.

C.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n                          BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GEORGE WASHINGTON GLICK.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Glick, ninth governor of Kansas, was born at Greencastle,\r\nFairfield county, Ohio, July 4, 1827. His great-grandfather, Philip\r\nGlick, a Revolutionary soldier, was one of five brothers who came to\r\nPennsylvania from Germany. His grandfather, George Glick, served in the\r\nWar of 1812, as did also his mother’s father, Capt. George Sanders.\r\nGovernor Glick’s father, Isaac Glick, was a man of influence in the\r\ncommunity in which he lived, took an active interest in State and local\r\npolitics, and held many positions of public trust. His mother, Mary\r\nSanders, was of Scotch parentage. Both parents lived to a good old age.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Glick was reared on his father’s farm near Fremont, Ohio, and\r\nthere acquired the habits of industry, economy and self-reliance that\r\nmade his later life so successful. At the age of twenty-one he entered\r\nthe office of Bucklin & Hayes as a law student, and was admitted to the\r\nbar two years later at Cincinnati by the supreme court. He began\r\npractice at Fremont, and soon won an enviable reputation as a hard-\r\nworking and successful lawyer. He fully sustained this reputation after\r\ncoming to Kansas.\r\n\r\nLocating at Atchison in the spring of 1859, he formed a partnership with\r\nHon. Alfred G. Otis, which lasted until 1874, when an affection of the\r\nthroat compelled him to abandon the practice of law. Mr. Glick soon took\r\na leading place at the Kansas bar. His practice extended to all the\r\ncourts. He was a salaried attorney for two railroads and a number of\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nMr. Glick was a natural leader and began early in life to take an active\r\npart in politics. When but thirty-one years of age he was nominated for\r\nCongress by the Democracy of his district in Ohio, but declined the\r\nnomination. The same year he was nominated for State senator and made\r\nthe race against Gen. R. P. Bucklin, his former law preceptor. He was\r\nelected to the Kansas legislature in 1862 without opposition, and\r\nreëlected in 1863, ’64, ’65, ’66, ’68, ’76 and ’82.\r\n\r\nDuring his service as a legislator, he secured the passage of many\r\nneeded and important laws which have settled and fixed the policy of the\r\nState on matters of vast interest, that have stood the test of time and\r\nexperience. In 1876 Mr. Glick was made speaker pro tem. of the house of\r\nrepresentatives, although that body was strongly Republican. He was a\r\ndelegate to Democratic National conventions in 1856, 1868, 1884 and\r\n1892. The Kansas delegation in the Democratic National convention at\r\nChicago in 1892 presented his name to that convention as its candidate\r\nfor vice-president, after the nomination of Grover Cleveland for\r\nPresident, and, although not the nominee of the convention for that\r\noffice, he received many votes. He was nominated for governor in 1868\r\nand made the race in obedience to his party’s call, though his defeat\r\nwas inevitable. In 1882 he was again the unanimous choice of his party\r\nfor governor and made a memorable campaign, speaking in nearly every\r\ncounty in the State; and, though fighting against great odds, among them\r\nbeing a Republican majority of over 52,000, he defeated that\r\ndistinguished Republican and Prohibitionist, John P. St. John, by 8,079\r\nvotes. Governor Glick was inaugurated January 8, 1883, and his\r\nadministration was marked by dignity, intelligence, and a careful and\r\ndiscreet management of the material and financial interests of the\r\nState. His long experience as a legislator gave him an intimate\r\nknowledge of its needs, and many valuable reform measures recommended in\r\nhis message to the legislature were accomplished. He entered an earnest\r\nprotest against the burdens imposed upon the agricultural classes by the\r\nrailroads and asked that legislation be enacted to prevent these\r\nexactions. A law creating a railroad commission, and embodying\r\nsubstantially all the improvements asked by him, was passed, and proved\r\nof great benefit to the people of the State.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 he was appointed by President Cleveland pension agent at Topeka\r\nand re-appointed when Mr. Cleveland again came into office. During Mr.\r\nGlick’s two terms as pension agent at the Topeka agency, he received and\r\ndisbursed over $85,000.00.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 he married Elizabeth Ryder, of Massillon, Ohio, a lady descended\r\nfrom a distinguished colonial ancestry. Her ancestors were among the\r\nfirst settlers of Concord, Mass., and she derived her name from forbears\r\nwho were well known among the early colonists of New York City. For\r\nfifty years and more this noble matron, having with her the best\r\ntraditions of American life, presided over the hospitable home of George\r\nW. Glick, with the grace and dignity inherited from a fine ancestry. She\r\nadded to the success of his public life the greater blessings of\r\ndomestic happiness. Two children were born to this union: Frederick H.\r\nGlick and Mrs. James W. Orr, of Atchison, Kan. He died at Atchison,\r\nKan., April 13, 1911, aged eighty-four years; his wife and children\r\nsurvive him.\r\n\r\nEach State is entitled to place in Statuary Hall at the capitol in\r\nWashington, statues of two of its citizens renowned in literature, art,\r\nwar or civil life, and several years ago one of such places was filled\r\nby the State of Kansas with a statue of John James Ingalls, of Atchison,\r\nKan. The regular session of the 1913 legislature of Kansas adopted a\r\nconcurrent resolution and made an appropriation for the purchase of a\r\nsuitable statue as a tribute to the memory of George Washington Glick,\r\nto be placed in Statuary Hall, where the Nation has granted to its\r\npeople the privilege of placing it. The statue was designed and executed\r\nby Charles H. Niehaus and accepted by Congress as a gift from Kansas,\r\nwith suitable ceremonies, and is now in Statuary Hall. A cut\r\nrepresenting it precedes this sketch. Sixteen thousand five hundred\r\ncopies of a volume containing the proceedings in Congress, and a plate\r\nof the statue, were, by authority of Congress, printed and distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HORACE MORTIMER JACKSON.\r\n\r\nHe who leaves behind him, when he passes beyond the goal from which no\r\nmortal man has ever returned, a pleasant and abiding memory of his\r\nexistence on this earth, and has bequeathed to his progeny and posterity\r\na heritage of right living and right thinking, has accomplished much.\r\nHis memory will be revered long after that of the individual who has\r\ndone nothing but accumulate wealth and has made no effort to leave this\r\nearthly abiding place a better place to live than when he came upon it.\r\nJudge Horace Mortimer Jackson, deceased, was a man who lived an upright\r\nlife, and was accorded the universal respect of his fellow men and was a\r\nlegal practitioner of high rank, whose honorable methods of practice and\r\nmanner of living were such as to commend him for most favorable mention\r\nin the archives of his adopted county of Atchison.\r\n\r\nJudge Horace M. Jackson was born near Albion, Penn., July 11, 1839, a\r\nson of Lyman Jackson, who was the son of Michael Jackson, whose father\r\nwas also named Michael, and was a native of Ireland. Michael Jackson,\r\nthe founder of the family in America, came from Ireland and settled near\r\nHartford, Conn. He went to the coast to trade and was not thereafter\r\nheard from and was supposed to have been killed by Indians. He had three\r\nsons, one of whom, Ebenezer, died in service as a soldier during the\r\nFrench and Indian war. Another son went south, and the third was Michael\r\nJackson, the direct ancestor of Horace M. Jackson. Michael was born\r\nMarch 28, 1735 and on June 4, 1755, was married to Susanna Willcocks,\r\nwho was born April 19, 1732. They settled in Windham county,\r\nConnecticut, later removing to Pownal, near Bennington, Vt. Michael\r\nJackson was a soldier in the colonial army during the French and Indian\r\nwar, and was a member of Company Ten, First regiment. He was discharged\r\nDecember 12, 1759. He also enlisted in the Seventh Company of the Third\r\nregiment of volunteers, Army of Independence, May 5, 1775, and was\r\ndischarged December 15, 1775. He later volunteered for service in Col.\r\nSamuel Herrick’s regiment of “Alarm Men.” Lyman, the son of Michael,\r\nalso served in the Revolution on the American side. He was born February\r\n29, 1755, at Simsbury, Hartford county, Connecticut. He enlisted eight\r\ndifferent times in the American army. Lyman married Deidama Dunham on\r\nJanuary 3, 1782. This couple lived at Albany, Otsego and Wyoming, N. Y.,\r\nat different times. To them were born thirteen children. About 1805,\r\nLyman Jackson settled in Erie county, Pennsylvania, and obtained a dense\r\ntract of timber land in the Holland Purchase from which he cleared a\r\nfarm. Seven sons and a son-in-law of this redoubtable patriot fought in\r\nthe War of 1812.\r\n\r\nLyman Jackson died March 20, 1835. David Bardsley Jackson, a son of\r\nLyman, born May 29, 1797, at Richfield, Otsego county, New York, married\r\nLucy Hendryx, on April 11, 1822, near Albion, Penn. He was the ninth\r\nchild of Lyman Jackson and cleared a farm of forty acres in the Holland\r\nPurchase on which he resided until the year 1830. He then sold his land,\r\nloaded his effects in a farm wagon, drove to Pittsburgh, and took\r\npassage down the Ohio river and thence up the Mississippi to Warsaw,\r\nIll., from which landing place on December 15, 1839 he drove to\r\nKnoxville, Ill., and bought a farm ten miles west of the village. He\r\nreturned to Pennsylvania in 1841, driving overland with his team 1,000\r\nmiles each way accompanied by his wife and two youngest children. In the\r\nyear 1846 he removed to a residence in Knoxville and engaged in the\r\ngrocery business. In 1854 he settled on a farm one-half mile west of\r\nCambridge, Henry county, Illinois. He lived here until 1876, then sold\r\nout and made his home at Gilson, for the remainder of his days. This\r\nsturdy pioneer died January 18, 1879. His children were: Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nRuth Pierce, Zaremba, Obadiah H., Gershom, David, Francis Marion,\r\nCharles Wilmer De Loss, Horace Mortimer, and Mrs. Annie Lucelia Wing.\r\n\r\nHorace Mortimer Jackson was reared on the farm, attended the schools of\r\nKnoxville, Ill., clerked in his father’s grocery store, sawed wood for\r\nforty cents per cord, and did the hardest kind of farm work while yet a\r\nboy. During 1860–61, he taught school for $28 per month. On August 7,\r\n1861, he started for De Soto, Neb., by way of Hannibal and St. Joseph.\r\nOn April 12, 1861, he boarded a steamer at St. Joseph en route for\r\nOmaha. Arriving there he joined his brother Zaremba on his farm in\r\nNebraska. He worked here for some time and assisted his brother in\r\ntilling the farm with oxen in the most primitive way. He saved his money\r\nand in 1862 returned to Cambridge, Ill., taught school during the winter\r\nand read law at night. He followed farming, served as deputy sheriff of\r\nthe county and finally located at Versailles, Mo., in the practice of\r\nlaw. He was a member of the board of education which gave the first\r\npublic school to the town of Versailles. He married Lavanchia Isabelle\r\nValentine, December 12, 1865. She was the eldest daughter of John O.\r\nValentine. For a time the newly wedded couple were in very poor\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nTheir furniture was of crude workmanship, made from store boxes. It was\r\nhere that the future judge made the friendship of Anderson W. Anthony, a\r\ngood lawyer whom he esteemed highly, who became his first law partner.\r\nHe made a journey to Wichita, Kan., in August, 1870, but located at\r\nMarysville, Mo., in September of the same year. He became a partner of\r\nD. L. Palmer, who later went to Jewell City, Kan. He then formed a\r\npartnership with Judge Thomas J. Johnston, and served as prosecuting\r\nattorney of the county. In December of 1878 he started for Beloit, Kan.,\r\nwith the intention of locating in that city, but stopped at Atchison\r\nwhere he met W. S. Greenleaf and Gen. W. W. Guthrie. He remained in\r\ntheir law offices during the ensuing winter. General Guthrie at that\r\ntime was a member of the State senate. He formed a partnership with Mr.\r\nGreenlea on March 17, 1879, which continued until Mr. Greenlea’s death\r\nin September, 1880. His wife died March 26, 1883, and he later, on\r\nFebruary 11, 1886, married Matilda (Adams) Rook, who had one daughter by\r\na former marriage, Effie, now the wife of C. A. Chandler, of Atchison.\r\nMatilda Adams Rook was a daughter of Peter and Martha Adams, of England,\r\nand sister of J. P. Adams, of Atchison. Horace M. Jackson was appointed\r\njudge of the district court on March 1, 1887, and continued as judge\r\nuntil his successor was elected. He and his son, William A., conducted\r\nthe law business and served as the local attorneys for the Santa Fe and\r\nthe Burlington railroads until his death, which occurred December 11,\r\n1910. Judge Jackson left two sons, William Anthony and Zaremba Edward.\r\nHe was a member of the Masonic fraternity, the Elks, Modern Woodmen and\r\nthe Ancient Order of United Workmen. He bequeathed to his children and\r\nposterity a heritage of an honorable, upright life without stain or\r\nblemish and will long be remembered as one of the honored citizens of\r\nAtchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ZAREMBA E. JACKSON.\r\n\r\nThe measure of a living citizen is his genuine worth to his community.\r\nIf he unselfishly strives to make his home city a better place in which\r\nto live, and does something by which he will long be remembered, as of\r\nlasting good, he has accomplished a task well worth while. While every\r\ntown and city can boast of such individuals who are striving to do\r\nthings in behalf of the public welfare, there are not a great number who\r\ncan act without any ulterior motive and without desire to bring\r\npecuniary reward to themselves. Of the class of better citizens\r\nmentioned as doing things for the betterment of the condition of the\r\ncitizenry, Z. E. Jackson, attorney of Atchison, occupies a prominent\r\nplace in the city. Gifted as an attorney, upright in all of his dealings\r\nwith his fellow men, interested to a high degree in the welfare of his\r\nfellow citizens, he has striven unselfishly to do good. Jackson Park,\r\nnamed after this gentleman, represents the culmination of one of his\r\ndreams and years of endeavor to create a breathing place of woodland\r\nbeauty and a public playground of which the city may well be proud.\r\n\r\nZ. E. Jackson was born in Maryville, Mo., September 23, 1872, and is a\r\nson of Judge Horace Mortimer Jackson, late of Atchison, and a review of\r\nwhom appears in this work. He came to Atchison with his parents when six\r\nyears of age. He received his primary education in the public schools of\r\nAtchison and afterward studied for two years in Midland College. He then\r\nmatriculated in the University of Illinois, with the intention of\r\npreparing himself to become an electrical engineer. After studying for\r\ntwo years in the Illinois university, he abandoned his original\r\nintention and returning to Atchison, entered his father’s law office in\r\n1893. He studied stenography without a regular instructor and prepared\r\nhimself to take dictation, filling the post of stenographer in his\r\nfather’s office while reading law. He studied law under his gifted\r\nfather’s tutelage and was admitted to the bar in 1899, being later\r\nadmitted to practice in the higher State and federal courts. At first he\r\npracticed alone and was then made a member of the law firm of Jackson &\r\nJackson. This firm was at first composed of Judge Horace M. Jackson, and\r\nhis son, William A., and when William A., was elected to the position of\r\njudge of the district court, it was composed of Horace M. and his son,\r\nZ. E. Jackson. Mr. Jackson is local attorney for the Home Building and\r\nLoan Association, and a director of the same concern. He is the local\r\nattorney for the Santa Fe Railroad System and the Burlington Railroad\r\nCompany. He is also the legal adviser for several of Atchison’s\r\ncorporations. Mr. Jackson has the reputation of being one of the ablest\r\nand cleanest practitioners of the Atchison county bar who has followed\r\nin the footsteps of his illustrious father in never refusing counsel or\r\nadvice to a public official, religious denomination or to a charitable\r\norganization, whether or not any fee was forthcoming—in fact, his office\r\nhas always been ready to give advice to applicants of the character of\r\nthe foregoing without charge or recompense of any kind. Mr. Jackson has\r\nnever turned away a client who had a meritorious cause, because of lack\r\nof funds, and in this respect resembles his father in his manner of\r\nconducting his legal practice. While Mr. Jackson is not a member of any\r\nparticular religious denomination, he has always been a liberal\r\ncontributor to all movements which have had for their intent the\r\nbetterment of the community. He is owner of Atchison real estate and\r\nfarm lands in Jackson county, Kansas, to which he gives his personal\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson’s career as a public official began in 1901, when he was\r\nelected police judge of the city and again elected in 1903, after which\r\nhe declined to again become a candidate for the office. His career as\r\npolice judge was marked by uniform fairness and impartiality, tempered\r\nwith kindness in dealing with the city’s minor malefactors who were\r\nbrought before him for judgment in his official capacity. From 1905 to\r\n1909 he was assistant city attorney, and in 1912 was elected to the\r\noffice of city attorney to fill the unexpired term of Daniel S. Hooper,\r\ndeceased. He served out the unexpired term and declined to become a\r\ncandidate in 1913, because of the growing demands of his large law\r\npractice. While serving as city attorney many important problems came up\r\nbefore the city for solution, such as the telephone merger, and the\r\nrenewal of the city’s contract with the Atchison Light and Power\r\nCompany. His wise advice and counsel steered the city government safely\r\nover the shoals, incidental to the settlement of these questions. Mr.\r\nJackson found the city finances in bad shape, as related to the renewal\r\nof the lighting contract, a condition of affairs brought about by his\r\npredecessor’s long illness preventing him from attending to business,\r\nand he immediately set to work to unravel the tangle and brought order\r\nout of chaos to the advantage of the city. Another matter to which he\r\ngave considerable attention while city attorney was the intercepting\r\nsewer problem which he handled satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson is a pronounced Republican in his political views, having\r\nbecome a convert to Republican principles when he became of age, a\r\ndecision which he was influenced to make by the panic of 1893. He is\r\naffiliated with the Knights of Pythias.\r\n\r\nHe was united in marriage with Miss Maud K. Smith, April 30, 1903. Mrs.\r\nJackson was born in Burlington, Iowa, a daughter of Lewis T. and Theresa\r\nJune (Chadwick) Smith, the former a native of Pennsylvania, and the\r\nlatter a native of Canada. Lewis T. Smith was born in 1846 in West\r\nLebanon, Pa., and is one of the old-time railroad men of the early days.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson’s creed of living is best expressed in his own words, “I\r\nbelieve that every man should do something for the community in which he\r\nlives, besides getting a living out of it.” It was the practice of his\r\ncreed which led to the beautiful park in the southeast part of the city\r\nbeing named in his honor, over his personal objections. The _Atchison\r\nGlobe_ says of his connection with the building and equipping of the\r\npark in the issue of August 18, 1913, in part, after quoting Mr.\r\nJackson’s creed, as above given:\r\n\r\n“That explains the principal reason why he (Z. E. Jackson) has taken\r\nsuch an interest in the park which now bears his name. Another reason is\r\nhe likes to dig in the ground, and investigate things as he finds them\r\nin the woods and wild places. He is also handy at improving on Nature\r\nhere and there without spoiling the general effect.\r\n\r\n“Seven or eight years ago, after spending many of his boyhood and young\r\nmanhood days in Jackson Park, he saw the possibilities of it for a\r\nbeautiful playground for young and old. He invited several of his South\r\nAtchison neighbors to meet in his law office one night and a park\r\nimprovement association was formed. In order to start a fund for\r\nimprovements in the park each member present put up five dollars. Other\r\ncitizens were invited to contribute and thus a small fund was raised.\r\n\r\n“That proved to be the redemption of City Park, a tract of fifty-six\r\nacres of woodland which cost the city $7,500 about thirty years ago.\r\n\r\n“With the few hundred dollars raised by private subscription it was\r\nshown what might be accomplished if the necessary funds were\r\nforthcoming. From the sale of a park bond, issued when the city was\r\ntrying to put the coal mine on its feet, the committee secured $500\r\nwhich was used in replacing the dam which makes the lake and other\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n“If effective service is to be rewarded, then the city council made no\r\nmistake when it acted on the petition presented to it, asking that the\r\nname of City Park be changed to Jackson Park in honor of Z. E. Jackson,\r\na young man who decided that the making of a park was the debt he owed\r\nthe community where he makes his living.”\r\n\r\nThe action referred to in the foregoing was taken August 1, 1913, when\r\nthe official name of Jackson Park was given to the tract in honor of Mr.\r\nJackson. Besides his work of superintending the park and bringing about\r\nits redemption with the assistance of other public spirited men, Mr.\r\nJackson and others secured a ten-acre tract of land lying between the\r\noriginal fifty-six acres and the Missouri river, which has been added to\r\nand is now a part of the park.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THOMAS FRABLE.\r\n\r\nThomas Frable, retired farmer, of Benton township, is one of the oldest\r\nliving pioneer citizens of Atchison county, both in age and number of\r\nyears of residence in the county. He was one of the old-time freighters\r\nwho conducted his own freighting outfit across the plains in the days of\r\nthe Civil war, and before the advent of the trans-continental railroads.\r\nMr. Frable was born in March, 1832, and has spent fifty-six of his four\r\nscore and four years of life in Atchison county and Kansas. He was born\r\non a farm in Pennsylvania, a son of Thomas Frable, who died when the\r\nsubject was three years of age, leaving his widow in such poor\r\ncircumstances that she was unable to rear her children in comfort.\r\nThomas was given a home by a man named Queen, who owned a large farm,\r\nand he lived with Queen until attaining his majority. Queen owned a farm\r\nof 300 acres, and Thomas was started to work when still a small boy,\r\nlearning to guide a plow across the fields when he was but eleven years\r\nof age. When he became of age and was free to do as he liked, the germ\r\nof adventure and ambition seized him and he decided to try his fortunes\r\nin the great West. In line with this resolve, he crossed the country to\r\nKansas in 1859, in company with another young fellow named Reuben\r\nFerguson, with whom he finally bought a tract of land which they farmed\r\nin common for a time, and then made a division. Mr. Frable still owns\r\neighty acres of the original tract which he and Ferguson purchased. Mr.\r\nFrable engaged in the freighting business and made considerable money in\r\nthe old days. He became the owner of two teams which he drove with the\r\ngreat trains which were constantly leaving Atchison in the early\r\nsixties, en route to the far West, and transported blasting powder to\r\nDenver and mining points in Colorado for the use of the gold and silver\r\nminers. He also carried corn for the United States Government. During\r\nthe Civil war Mr. Frable was enrolled as a member of the Kansas State\r\nmilitia, and served at the battle of Westport in the expedition against\r\nthe rebel, General Price. After the war he settled down to farming in\r\nBenton township, and has prospered exceedingly, he and his son, Harry,\r\nnow owning over 560 acres of fine land. The Frable home is one of the\r\nmost imposing and best built farm residences in the county, and Harry\r\nFrable recently erected a large barn in which the live stock of this\r\nextensive farm is housed. Mr. Frable and Harry have been life-long\r\nRepublicans.\r\n\r\nThomas Frable was married in 1862 to Rebecca Graham, a daughter of\r\nRichard Graham, who came from Pennsylvania with his family to Atchison\r\ncounty in the early days, and was one of the well known pioneers of this\r\ncounty. Mrs. Frable was born October 5, 1835, and died in November,\r\n1908. Five children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Frable, namely:\r\nClara, deceased; Margaret, dying in infancy: two died in infancy; and\r\nHarry was born January 22, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JAMES W. ORR.\r\n\r\nThe reviewer, in attempting to write a comprehensive and truthful\r\nbiography of an individual, must take into consideration the related\r\nfacts as to birth and subsequent career, the success attained, the\r\nunderlying principles which have combined to assist him in achieving his\r\ndesires and ambitions, and to lay particular stress upon the special\r\ntalent which has been developed in the life of the subject under review.\r\nIn reviewing the life career of James W. Orr, a leading member of the\r\nAtchison county bar, the fact is determined that he is truly an able and\r\ndistinguished lawyer, whose reputation for success at the bar, for\r\nhaving a profound knowledge of the law, and his ability to successfully\r\npractice in the courts of the land, arrayed against the brightest minds\r\nof the legal profession of the country, is recognized, not only by the\r\npeople of the State of Kansas and his profession generally, but by the\r\nUnited States Government, in whose employ he now is as special assistant\r\nto the attorney general of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Eng. by E. G. Williams & Bro. N. Y._\r\n\r\n  _James W Orr._\r\n]\r\n\r\nJames W. Orr was born September 14, 1855, in the town of Reading,\r\nHillsdale county, Michigan. In his boyhood days, and during the struggle\r\nto educate himself for the practice of his chosen profession, he knew\r\nwhat adversity meant and has the satisfaction of knowing that his\r\neducation was obtained through his own unaided efforts. He is a son of\r\nJames and Mary Elizabeth (Underhill) Orr, both of whom were natives of\r\nNew York City. His father was of Scotch-Irish descent, his forebears\r\nemigrating from Scotland to the north of Ireland in the days of old to\r\nescape religious persecution. His paternal grandfather left Ireland in\r\nan early day and made his home in New York. The Underhill family is of\r\nEnglish origin and a very old one in America, several generations of\r\nwhom have been born and reared in this country. His maternal grandfather\r\nwas Daniel Underhill, a goldsmith in New York City. James Orr, the\r\nfather, was a merchant in New York till about 1848, when he left his\r\nnative city and engaged in merchandising in Rome, Syracuse and Utica, N.\r\nY., (three stores), following which he engaged in wholesale business in\r\nToledo, Ohio. While a resident of Toledo he became identified with some\r\nof the enterprises of that day and was a stockholder, director and one\r\nof the builders of the Erie & Dunkirk railroad. In 1861 he removed to\r\nColdwater, Mich., and conducted a merchandise business there until 1868,\r\nwhen, in broken health, he settled in Niles, Mich., where he died.\r\n\r\nWhen James W. Orr was fourteen years of age he began earning his own\r\nliving and educating himself. He and his brother, Louis C. Orr, the\r\npresent postmaster of Atchison, worked together for several years,\r\nsharing their work with each other and pooling their earnings. The boys\r\nwere fortunate in having a wise and ambitious mother who was well\r\neducated and who taught them at home, thus giving them the education\r\nthey were financially unable to obtain at school. At the age of\r\nseventeen years while employed in a drug store he was reading law at\r\nnights and at odd times when his work was not pressing. By persistent\r\nendeavor he managed to secure two years of study at Michigan University,\r\nat Ann Arbor. He then took his examination for admission to the bar in\r\nopen court, and was admitted to practice when but twenty years of age.\r\nHis first employment in his new profession was with the McCormick\r\nHarvester Company, settling claims, etc., in behalf of that company. He\r\nremained in this position until 1880, and in January, 1881, came to\r\nAtchison where he has since continuously resided. It was necessary for\r\nhim to begin the upward climb of the ladder to fame and success without\r\nassistance from any individual or friend. How well Mr. Orr has succeeded\r\nduring the past thirty-four years is attested by his present high\r\nposition in the ranks of the legal profession and the competence he has\r\naccumulated. He was first employed in Atchison by the New England Loan &\r\nTrust Company as attorney to examine abstracts of titles, etc., at a\r\nsalary of forty dollars per month. It was not long until he was\r\nreceiving a salary of $150 per month and a share of the profits in the\r\nemploy of the same concern. When the concern moved to Kansas City and\r\nbecame known as the Equitable Loan & Trust Company, Mr. Orr remained in\r\nAtchison. In 1883 he was married to Miss Jennie Glick, the only daughter\r\nof Governor George W. Glick, of Atchison. He took up the practice of\r\nlaw, purchasing the interest of Judge W. D. Webb in the firm of Webb &\r\nMartin, and entered into partnership with A. F. Martin, which\r\npartnership existed from 1882 until April, 1887. During the five years\r\nhe had been in Atchison he had been extending his acquaintance over the\r\ncounty, and in November, 1866, was a successful candidate for county\r\nattorney on the Democratic ticket, being elected over W. D. Gilbert by a\r\nsubstantial majority, despite the fact that the county was then normally\r\nRepublican by over 800 majority. In April, 1887, he formed a law\r\npartnership with B. P. Waggener and Judge David Martin, the firm having\r\npreviously been known as Everest & Waggener. Judge Martin resigning the\r\nposition of judge of the Atchison district court to join the firm, which\r\nwas known as Waggener, Martin & Orr. In the year 1895 Judge Martin\r\nretired from the firm, and Judge A. H. Horton, then chief justice of the\r\nsupreme court of Kansas, resigned his office of chief justice, a\r\nposition he had held continuously for nineteen years, to become a member\r\nof the firm. Judge Dawn Martin was appointed to the vacancy so made on\r\nthe supreme bench. Judge Horton remained a member of the firm until his\r\ndeath, when ex-Chief Justice Frank Doster became a member of the firm\r\nknown as Waggener, Doster & Orr. During Mr. Orr’s association with B. P.\r\nWaggener in the practice of law they had charge of the legal business\r\nfor the Gould system of railroads in Kansas and Nebraska; the Western\r\nUnion Telegraph Company; express companies, and the Pullman Palace Car\r\nCompany. They were associated in partnership with three ex-chief\r\njustices of the supreme court of Kansas during this period. In June,\r\n1910, Mr. Orr resigned his position as attorney for the Missouri Pacific\r\nRailway Company, and his connection with B. P. Waggener, which had then\r\ncontinued for twenty-three years, was also terminated. The position of\r\nspecial assistant to the attorney-general of the United States was\r\nproffered him by Attorney-General McReynolds in October, 1913, while Mr.\r\nOrr was engaged in the trial of a case in St. Louis. He accepted and was\r\ngiven charge of the suit of the Government against the Southern Pacific\r\nCompany and others, including the Central Pacific Railway, to dissolve\r\nthe relations between those companies. Mr. Orr conducts his cases for\r\nthe Government in addition to his private practice. His rise has been\r\nsteady and consistent during the years he has been practicing his\r\nprofession in Atchison, and it is true that the youth who began his\r\ncareer in the city of Atchison for the modest salary of forty dollars\r\nper month now enjoys a lucrative private law practice, in addition to\r\nhis income from the Government and not supplemented by corporation\r\nsalaries. Mr. Orr has accumulated a comfortable fortune during the years\r\nof his practice and has what is considered the most beautiful home in\r\nAtchison. In his home he has his private library of several hundred\r\nvolumes, including the standard works of literature. His law library\r\nlines the walls of his down-town offices and exceeds 2,000 volumes in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Residence of J. W. Orr.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Orr had but one child, a son, George Glick Orr, who was\r\ndrowned while bathing in the Pacific ocean, near San Diego, Cal., on\r\nJuly 21, 1909, at the age of twenty-five years. The loss of this\r\ntalented young man saddened the lives of his parents for years. At the\r\nage when most young men are just beginning to gain a higher education,\r\nGeorge Glick Orr could read, write and speak six different languages.\r\nFor seventeen years of his life he was a student, graduated at the\r\nUniversity of Kansas, and had been admitted to the bar, showing great\r\npromise in his chosen profession and being frequently entrusted with\r\nimportant legal matters.\r\n\r\nMr. Orr has received all the Masonic degrees except the thirty-third,\r\nand is a member of several fraternal societies. He attends and\r\ncontributes to the support of the Christian Science Church, of which\r\nMrs. Orr is a member.\r\n\r\nIn politics and as a public official and law-maker, Mr. Orr has a record\r\nof which any man may well be proud. He became a member of the Kansas\r\nDemocratic State central committee in 1884 and remained such\r\ncontinuously until 1908, and in point of service was its oldest member.\r\nHe has attended, as a delegate, six National Democratic conventions, and\r\non three occasions was a member of the notification committee appointed\r\nto officially notify the presidential candidate of his nomination by the\r\nconvention, including Cleveland in 1892; Parker in 1904, and Woodrow\r\nWilson in 1912. His exceptional career in politics began as early as\r\n1880, when he served as assistant secretary of the committee chosen to\r\nnotify General Hancock at Governor’s Island, N. Y., of his nomination\r\nfor the Presidency. Mr. Orr was an original Wilson man and one of the\r\ncommittee of five having the floor management of the Wilson forces at\r\nthe Baltimore convention in 1912 which nominated Mr. Wilson for the\r\nPresidency. From 1901 to 1907 Mr. Orr served three terms successively as\r\nmayor of the city of Atchison and gave the city one of the best\r\nadministrations in its history. He served two terms in the State\r\nlegislature as representative from the Atchison city district, the\r\nsessions of 1911 and 1913. During the 1911 session he was one of the\r\nthree legislators selected by the house to draft and did prepare the\r\npresent public utilities law, under which all railroads and public\r\nutilities in this State are now managed and controlled; he was the\r\nauthor of the present comprehensive drainage laws; the law requiring the\r\nattorney-general to pay into the State treasury all fees received by him\r\nin the prosecution of State cases; the so-called “Orr viaduct law,”\r\nwhich requires railroads to construct and maintain at their expense all\r\nnecessary viaducts over or tunnels under their tracks in cities, and\r\nunder which the Fourteenth street viaduct in this city and viaducts in\r\nmany other cities have been built and then maintained by the railroads,\r\nalso many other laws of public interest and importance. In the session\r\nof 1913 he was chairman of the judiciary committee and was elected\r\nmajority leader of the house. At the close of the legislative session of\r\n1913 Mr. Orr was presented with a resolution, unanimously adopted by the\r\nmembers of the house, beautifully engraved in India ink, artistically\r\nframed and containing a reproduction of the great seal of Kansas. This\r\nresolution thanks Mr. Orr for the assistance he had given individual\r\nmembers of the house and for his service to the State, both as chairman\r\nof the judiciary committee and as majority house leader, and is signed\r\nby every member. It follows:\r\n\r\n  “HOUSE RESOLUTION, NO. 51—BY MR. RIDDLE.\r\n\r\n  “Resolved. That the members of the house extend to the Hon. James W.\r\n  Orr their sincere thanks for the splendid service he has given to\r\n  them and to the State during the present session. In addition to his\r\n  work as floor leader of the majority party, and his work as chairman\r\n  of the judiciary committee, he has been tireless, patient, and\r\n  industrious in giving to individual members the benefit of his\r\n  learning and ability by helping them in their work. His help has\r\n  been extended alike to members of all political parties, and has\r\n  been especially beneficial to members who have had little experience\r\n  in legislative work. He has the confidence, esteem and love of all\r\n  the members.\r\n\r\n  “Done in the city of Topeka, this eighth day of March, 1913.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ANDREW B. SYMNS.\r\n\r\nWhen the late A. B. Symns passed beyond mortal ken on April 9, 1905,\r\nAtchison suffered a loss from its business circles which could never be\r\nreplaced. He left behind him a monument in the A. B. Symns Grocer\r\nCompany, one of the largest of the wholesale establishments of the city\r\nand State, which was the product of his brain and ability. He was one of\r\nthe noted pioneer figures of a decade which produced great and strong\r\nmen. From a modest beginning he rose to become a national character in\r\nthe business world of the great West and realized his ambition during a\r\nlong and useful life. He not only succeeded in accumulating a\r\ncomfortable fortune but left a reputation for integrity and upright\r\ncitizenship which has never been surpassed by any of his compeers of the\r\nbuilding age in Atchison and Kansas. From boyhood to the time he had\r\npassed the age of three score years and ten, Mr. Symns was an\r\nindefatigable worker and never relaxed except for much needed recreation\r\nand rest, occasionally. Early in his career he had great faith in the\r\nfuture of Atchison and that faith was fully justified by his own success\r\nin the jobbing field.\r\n\r\nA. B. Symns was born in Monroe county. West Virginia, March 27, 1831,\r\nand was a son of John and Elizabeth (Peters) Symns, natives of old\r\nVirginia, of Scotch-Irish descent.\r\n\r\nAs a boy he worked on his father’s farm, attending school three months\r\neach winter. At the age of eighteen he clerked in a store at Petertown\r\nand later on attended Lewisburg Seminary one year. He also worked at\r\nWhite Sulphur Springs before coming west in 1853. He listened to the\r\ncall of the great unpeopled western country for young and ambitious men\r\nto develop her dormant resources, and in 1853 crossed the country to St.\r\nJoseph. Mo., where he clerked in a store for two years and then went to\r\nSt. Louis. After clerking in St. Louis for one year he became an eighth\r\nowner of the steamboat “Hesperian” and served as clerk aboard the\r\nsteamer. This boat made its first trip on the Missouri trade in 1856 and\r\nit was while passing up and down the Missouri river that he was\r\nattracted to the then flourishing town of Doniphan. It far overshadowed\r\nAtchison at that time and he determined to locate in Doniphan. During\r\nthe time he was connected with the steamboat service he had many\r\ninteresting experiences. He opened a grocery store in 1858, but during\r\nthe same year the land office was removed to Atchison and Doniphan lost\r\nground, but the Symns store grew in size and importance and was the\r\nnucleus around which his great business was subsequently builded. He\r\nremoved the store to Atchison in 1872, and began wholesaling in a small\r\nway in connection with his retail business. In 1877 he was doing\r\nbusiness in the corner store room at Sixth and Commercial streets, on\r\nthe southeast corner. While located in this building he closed out his\r\nretail business and engaged in jobbing exclusively. With the impetus\r\ngiven by his splendid business mind and his remarkable energy the\r\nbusiness grew rapidly, and he soon found himself at the head of one of\r\nthe largest wholesale grocery houses in the western country. Thirty men\r\nare employed as traveling salesmen by the Symns Grocer Company alone,\r\nand the Symns Utah Grocer Company, which he established, has its own\r\nforce. Customers of Mr. Symns over Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri,\r\nTexas, Colorado and Utah have always agreed that A. B. Symns was the\r\nfairest man with whom they ever did business. He had faith in Atchison\r\nas a great jobbing center, and the success of his business fully\r\njustified that belief. The immense jobbing house of the Symns Grocer\r\nCompany on Main street of Atchison was built from plans prepared by Mr.\r\nSymns himself and is one of the most complete establishments of the kind\r\nto be found anywhere. So extensive did the business become, however,\r\nthat it was necessary to erect an addition in 1903. The capitalization\r\nof the Symns Grocer Company at the time of the demise of Mr. Symns was\r\n$300,000 and that of the Utah concern at Salt Lake City was $80,000. Mr.\r\nSymns was president of both companies and had a controlling interest in\r\neach. He left an estate valued at over $300,000.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting episodes of Mr. Symns’ mercantile career was the\r\nlooting of his Doniphan store by Cleveland’s band of outlaws, who made\r\nAtchison their headquarters in the winter of 1861–62. At the time Mr.\r\nSymns was absent in St. Joseph, but his brothers, Sam and William Symns,\r\nwere in charge when it was surrounded one evening by Cleveland and his\r\ngang. They forced William Symns to open the safe and took what money\r\nthere was on hand in addition to clothing, saddles, etc. While the\r\nrobbery was in progress, Mrs. Symns ran out to arouse the neighbors, but\r\nno help was forthcoming because of the fact that everybody was afraid of\r\nCleveland and his gang, and the thieves got away with their booty\r\nunmolested.\r\n\r\nA. B. Symns was married in 1858, returning to Old Virginia for his\r\nbride, Miss Elizabeth Tiffany, who was his boyhood sweetheart. Mrs.\r\nSymns was a member of an excellent Virginia family and bore him the\r\nfollowing children: Mrs. A. S. Rowan, who died December 31, 1903; Miss\r\nEffie Symns, of Atchison; Charles, Atchison, and Guy. The mother of\r\nthese children departed this life September 12, 1900, at the age of\r\nsixty-four years, having been born in 1836. Six children were born and\r\ndied in infancy at Doniphan: John, Joseph, Lee, Hugh, Edna and Louis.\r\nMr. Symns died April 9, 1905, at Hot Springs, Ark. He was sincerely\r\nmourned and Atchison business circles suffered a loss which could hardly\r\nbe estimated.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. and Mrs. Symns were on their wedding trip on the steamer\r\n“Carrier” en route up the Missouri river from St. Louis to Doniphan, the\r\nboat sank near Hermann, Mo. They easily escaped drowning because the\r\n“Carrier” sank slowly, but they lost their newly purchased household\r\ngoods and a large amount of supplies with which Mr. Symns intended to\r\nstock the Doniphan store. Mrs. Symns continued to Doniphan on another\r\nboat, while Mr. Symns returned to St. Louis to lay in another stock of\r\nhousehold goods and provisions for his store.\r\n\r\nThe Symns family came of old Scotch Presbyterian stock. Although a\r\nsoutherner by birth, he was a Union man in Kansas. He was an independent\r\nDemocrat in politics.\r\n\r\nMr. Symns was in active pursuits even after attaining the age of three\r\nscore years and ten, and was always found early at his desk. He was not\r\nonly the active head of the business but closely watched the details. He\r\nwas always hurrying and was ever busy, and it was his custom to walk\r\ndaily to the postoffice for his mail so as to have the benefit of the\r\nexercise. Having always been a man of correct habits he belied his years\r\nand his demise came unexpectedly at Hot Springs. He was accidentally\r\nkilled by a locomotive on a railroad crossing at Hot Springs, where it\r\nhad been his custom to go for his health during the latter ten years of\r\nhis life. He was fond of his family and dearly loved his home life. He\r\nwas quiet, unassuming, and was one of the kindest and gentlest of men,\r\nprobably no man being more universally admired and beloved in Atchison\r\nduring his day. His life story furnishes a decided inspiration for any\r\none who may read of his success in Atchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BALIE PEYTON WAGGENER.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to classify Balie P. Waggener so as to determine his\r\nposition in the civic body of Atchison, but it is not easy to write a\r\nreview comprehensive enough to give a proper estimate of this\r\ndistinguished citizen who has been honored in his home city and in the\r\nState of Kansas. When one thinks of Atchison it is only natural to refer\r\nto the city as the home of Balie Waggener, who is indisputably grouped\r\namong the prominent and widely known figures who have shed fame and\r\nluster upon their home city. A leading attorney, statesman, progressive\r\ncitizen, builder, farmer and stockman, friend of all children,\r\ncapitalist, and public benefactor are some of the terms which might be\r\napplied to him without fear of contradiction from the mass of the people\r\nwho know him best.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Platte county, Missouri, July 18, 1847, a son of Peyton\r\nR. and Sophronia Briseis (Willis) Waggener, who were American born and\r\ndescended from old American families. The great-grandfather of Mr.\r\nWaggener served in the Continental army as a lieutenant-colonel during\r\nthe American war of independence, and his grandfather was a major in the\r\nUnited States army during the War of 1812. Balie Waggener attended the\r\npublic schools until he attained the age of fourteen years and then\r\nobtained a situation as toll-gate keeper on the old Platte City &\r\nWestern turnpike. He was ambitious to become a lawyer and during the\r\ninterims of his duties in attending the toll-gate, and after his day’s\r\nwork was done, he read his law books. The next step in his preparation\r\nto become a member of the legal profession was to enter the law office\r\nof Otis & Glick, in Atchison. This was in 1866, and so assiduously did\r\nthe young man apply himself to his studies that he was admitted to the\r\nbar June 10, 1867. Three years later he formed a partnership with Albert\r\nH. Norton, then United States district attorney, under the firm name of\r\nHorton & Waggener, which lasted until the election of Judge Horton to\r\nthe office of chief justice of the Kansas supreme court in 1876. In 1887\r\nMr. Waggener formed a partnership under the firm name of Waggener,\r\nMartin & Orr, which continued until April 30, 1895, when the firm was\r\ndissolved and the firm became Waggener, Horton & Orr, Chief Justice\r\nHorton having resigned his position and again entered the firm. David\r\nMartin, Mr. Waggener’s former partner, became chief justice of the\r\nsupreme court of Kansas to succeed Chief Justice Horton. In 1902 Judge\r\nHorton died, and later his place in the firm was taken by Ex-Chief\r\nJustice Frank Doster, under the firm name of Waggener, Doster & Orr. It\r\nwill thus be seen that Mr. Waggener has been associated in the practice\r\nof law with three chief justices of the supreme court of Kansas. In 1913\r\nMr. Orr withdrew from the firm to become special assistant to the\r\nattorney-general of the United States, and the firm is now known as\r\nWaggener, Challiss & Crane, being composed of W. P. Waggener, James\r\nChalliss and Albert Crane. Mr. Waggener now devotes his time and legal\r\ntalents almost exclusively to his duties as general solicitor for the\r\nMissouri Pacific railway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _B. P. Waggener_\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe ability of a lawyer having the calibre of Mr. Waggener was bound to\r\nattract attention, and on January 4, 1876, he was appointed general\r\nattorney of the Missouri Pacific railway for the State of Kansas, and on\r\nMay 1, 1910, he was made general solicitor for that company for the\r\nStates of Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado, his son, W. P. Waggener,\r\nsucceeding him as general attorney for Kansas. During the forty-four\r\nyears Mr. Waggener has been engaged in the practice of law he has won an\r\nenviable position at the bar through his own personal efforts. He has\r\nnever ceased to be a student of all subjects pertaining to that most\r\njealous of professions, and it is worthy of note that he is the\r\npossessor of one of the most complete law libraries in the United\r\nStates, containing upward of 10,000 volumes on every conceivable legal\r\nsubject. He keeps his library at his residence, which is one of the\r\nhandsomest and best appointed in the city of Atchison, and he prepares\r\nmost of his cases in the study of his home where privacy is possible.\r\n\r\nNaturally, a man of Mr. Waggener’s vigor and broad-mindedness would\r\nengage in enterprises outside of the practice of his profession, and he\r\nhas done so in such a manner as to profit himself and the community. In\r\n1892 he was elected president of the Exchange National Bank of Atchison,\r\nwhich position he has since held. He perfected and put into operation\r\nthe Atchison Railway, Light and Power Company in the city, and is the\r\nowner of the famous “Green View Stock Farm,” comprising 500 acres,\r\nbeautifully located a short distance west of Atchison, and which is one\r\nof the best equipped and most modern farms in Kansas. Through\r\nexperimentation and adapting modern methods of agriculture to the\r\ncultivation of his land and the breeding of fine live stock, Mr.\r\nWaggener has become a recognized authority on agriculture and animal\r\nhusbandry. The annual sales of fine live stock which are produced on his\r\nfarm have become an annual event in this section of Kansas and the West,\r\nand are largely attended by buyers from all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his professional and business interests, Mr. Waggener has\r\nmanifested a public spirit in matters pertaining to the political\r\nconditions of his city and State. Firmly grounded in Democratic\r\nprinciples, he has become one of the foremost leaders of his party and\r\noccupies a high place in its councils. In 1869 he was elected to the\r\nAtchison city council when he had barely attained his majority. In the\r\nyear 1872 he was the nominee of his party for the office of attorney-\r\ngeneral of the State of Kansas, and in 1873 was made city attorney. From\r\n1889 to 1891 and again in 1895–97 he was mayor of the city. In 1902 he\r\nwas elected a member of the lower branch of the State legislature, which\r\nhad a large Republican majority, and during the term held the important\r\nposition of chairman of the judiciary committee. It is generally\r\nconceded that he influenced much of the legislation at that session, and\r\nhis record so commended him to his constituents that in 1904 he was\r\nelected to the State senate from a strong Republican district, carrying\r\nthe district by a majority of 1,500 votes, although at the same election\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, the Republican candidate for President, carried the\r\nsame district by over 3,600, an indisputable testimonial to Mr.\r\nWaggener’s personal popularity and his ability. Mr. Waggener served in\r\nthe senate of the Kansas State legislature in the sessions of 1905 and\r\n1907, and was reëlected by a handsome majority of over 2,000 in November\r\nof 1912. He is now holding the position of State senator from this\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nMr. Waggener is a member of many secret orders, and is prominent in\r\nMasonic circles, being a Knights Templar and a Thirty-second degree\r\nmember of the Scottish Rite, and a member of the Mystic Shrine.\r\n\r\nOn May 27, 1869, Mr. Waggener married Miss Emma L., daughter of William\r\nW. Hetherington, one of Atchison’s prominent citizens, now deceased, a\r\nreview of whose life and career is given elsewhere in this volume. Two\r\nchildren were born to this union: William Peyton Waggener, a “chip off\r\nthe old block,” and present general attorney of the Missouri Pacific\r\nrailway for the State of Kansas, and president of the Exchange State\r\nBank of Atchison; Mabel L., wife of R. K. Smith, vice-president and\r\ngeneral manager of the Mississippi Central railway.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the trait of character that most endears Mr. Waggener to the\r\npeople of Atchison county is that liberality which led him in 1897 to\r\ninaugurate the system of giving an annual picnic to the children. Every\r\nyear, at his own personal expense, he furnishes free transportation,\r\nfree entertainment, and free refreshments to all the children of\r\nAtchison county who can attend his picnic, and the larger the crowd the\r\ngreater is his delight. These picnics are not given for the purpose of\r\nincreasing his popularity or for any self-aggrandizement whatever, but\r\nsolely that he may steal at least one day from his business cares and\r\nderive a wholesome recreation in contributing to the amusement of the\r\nyoung people. This innovation has occasioned at various times favorable\r\nand commendatory comment in the press of the State, and a record of\r\nthese picnics has been placed in the annals of the Kansas State\r\nHistorical Society. The report of the secretary of the historical\r\nsociety for the year 1911 has considerable to say concerning the visit\r\nof President Taft to Kansas in that year and his attendance upon Balie\r\nPeyton Waggener’s picnic to the children of the neighborhood. The\r\nPresident left Topeka on September 27, about one hour after laying the\r\ncornerstone of the Memorial Hall building and reached Atchison in time\r\nfor Mr. Waggener’s twelfth annual picnic. The President spoke words of\r\nhigh praise of Mr. Waggener and presented him with a silver loving cup\r\nin behalf of the people of Atchison county. Mr. Taft’s words in making\r\nthe presentation were: “A token is this, Mr. Waggener, that carries real\r\nsincerity of friendship. I present this beautiful vase of silver in the\r\nname of the people here assembled as a sign of love and esteem. I\r\ncongratulate you on the eminence you have attained.” Mr. Waggener\r\nresponded: “This is a distinction unmerited. I have no words to express\r\nmy grateful acknowledgment.” Balie Waggener’s picnic has become a\r\nfeature of Kansas history of a most pleasant nature. He is a life member\r\nof the State Historical Society, and has always been an ardent and most\r\nliberal friend of the society.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Waggener was forced by illness to go to Rochester, Minn., for\r\nthe purpose of having a surgical operation performed, his safe return to\r\nhis home was made the occasion of a time of great rejoicing by the\r\nchildren of the city, and a reception was given him, such as has never\r\nbeen given an Atchison citizen before nor since, and which occasioned\r\nState-wide comment on the part of the press as a fitting testimonial of\r\nthe great love and esteem in which he was held by the children and\r\npeople of his home city. During the time he was at Rochester undergoing\r\na surgical operation and his subsequent recovery, the children of the\r\ncity had been praying for his restoration to health and his safe return\r\nto their midst. It was their great friend who was ill, and, when the\r\nword came that he would arrive home on a certain evening the children\r\nprepared to receive him in an appropriate manner. All the children of\r\nAtchison turned out to give him welcome, and hundreds formed in line,\r\nthrough which Mr. Waggener passed on his way to his home. He and his\r\nautomobile were pelted with flowers and tears filled his eyes, and he\r\nwas unable to express his heart-felt appreciation of the reception which\r\nhis people had given him. It has been described as the most beautiful\r\nand touching thing that has ever happened in the life of Mr. Waggener.\r\nTo quote briefly from the _Kansas City Journal_, which described the\r\nincident: “Few men in this world were so fortunate as to enjoy such an\r\novation. Men who have done important things have been received by town\r\nbands and by citizens covered with fluttering badges. Men have come back\r\nto their home people to be received in the opera house, and cheers have\r\nechoed in their receptive ears. But it must be understood that no such\r\nhome-coming as Mr. Waggener’s could come to an ordinary man. It was the\r\ntribute of sincere devotion and genuine friendship. It couldn’t be\r\nbought with money or earned by material success. These Atchison children\r\ndidn’t care a rap for Waggener, the railroad attorney, nor Waggener, the\r\npolitician, nor even for Waggener, the exemplary citizen. It was Mr.\r\nWaggener, the good, kind friend they loved, to whom the welcome was\r\ngiven, and it sprung from sheer joy that he had recovered his health and\r\nwas with them once more. And who can say that the earth holds a more\r\nsplendid triumph as the crowning glory of a life than this? All other\r\nlaudations and exclamations are tame compared with the flushed\r\nenthusiasm of hundreds of happy children shouting from their hearts:\r\n\r\n                “‘Waggener, Waggener sis boom ah!\r\n                Our friend, our friend, rah! rah! rah!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ALBERT E. MAYHEW.\r\n\r\nPersonal achievement on the part of the individual who accomplishes\r\nthings worth while for himself and in behalf of his fellow men, is\r\nalways worth recording. The inherent qualities possessed by an able man\r\nwill develop and become pronounced in decided results if he be given the\r\nproper opportunity. Albert E. Mayhew, legislative representative from\r\nthe Atchison county district, and a successful merchant, belongs to that\r\ntype of men who by force of intellect and sheer ability to do things\r\nhave placed themselves in the forefront of affairs and taken their\r\nproper places as leaders in their respective communities. Forty-five\r\nyears of his life have been spent in Kansas, and he can properly be\r\nclassed as one of the pioneers of the State. Mr. Mayhew established\r\nhimself in business in Effingham January 1, 1899, and his success since\r\nhis advent into Atchison county has been marked and rapid. He began at\r\nfirst with a capital of $3,000 invested in a hardware and implement\r\nbusiness. With characteristic energy and enterprise he developed his\r\nbusiness to the extent that his extensive stock of goods now requires a\r\ncapital of $10,000. In 1912 he purchased a lot at the corner of the two\r\nprincipal streets of Effingham and erected a handsome two-story brick\r\nbuilding and a warehouse at the same time. This building measures 84×60\r\nfeet, including the warehouse and two splendid show rooms, filled with\r\nhigh class goods. The stock of goods in the Mayhew establishment\r\nembraces hardware, farming implements and wagons, paints, furniture, and\r\nhe also conducts an undertaking establishment. Three men are employed to\r\nattend to the extensive trade of this store, which is the most important\r\ninstitution of its kind in this section of the county.\r\n\r\nAlbert E. Mayhew was born March 17, 1866, at St. Mary’s, Ontario,\r\nCanada, a son of William, born in 1833, died in March, 1906, and Mary\r\n(Lancaster), born in 1833, died December 25, 1878, Mayhew, both of whom\r\nwere born in England and immigrated to Canada when in their youth.\r\nWilliam Mayhew ran away from home and made his way to Canada where he\r\nbecame a farmer and married. William Mayhew and his wife resided in\r\nCanada until May, 1870, when they immigrated to Kansas, settling in\r\nNemaha county. They purchased a farm near the town of Centralia,\r\ndeveloped it and Mr. Mayhew made a success of farming and stock raising.\r\nHe began with a large tract of land at first, but soon ascertained that\r\nit were better to have a smaller farm, and accordingly reduced his\r\nacreage to 160 acres, upon which he prospered. Mrs. Mayhew, the mother\r\nof Albert E., died on the home place in Nemaha county. William, as old\r\nage crept upon him, removed to San Diego, Cal., where his demise\r\noccurred. He is buried in the cemetery of the California city. Five sons\r\nand a daughter were born to William Mayhew and wife, namely: John, a\r\nmerchant, of Denver, Colo.; Robert, a retired farmer and merchant,\r\nliving in Topeka. Kan.; George, a merchant, of Denver, Colo.; Eliza,\r\nwife of A. B. Clippinger, Kansas City, Mo.; Albert E., the subject of\r\nthis review, and Leonard, of Los Angeles, Cal.\r\n\r\nAlbert E. was reared to young manhood on the home farm in Nemaha county,\r\nand received his education in the public schools of Centralia, Kan., and\r\nthe Seneca, Kan., high school, completing his education in the normal\r\nschool at Emporia, Kan. He taught school for a number of years in his\r\nhome county, saved his earnings and in 1887 embarked in the hardware and\r\nimplement business at Vermilion, Kan. He conducted this business with\r\nfair success until 1897, and then sold out, coming to Effingham soon\r\nafterward and engaging in the same line of business in this city. In\r\naddition to his extensive business Mr. Mayhew is the owner of two\r\nexcellent farms in Marshall county, Kansas, aggregating 640 acres in\r\nall, which has his attention. He has a beautiful, modern residence in\r\nthe south part of Effingham.\r\n\r\nMr. Mayhew was married in September, 1887, to Anna J. Tinker, of\r\nVermilion, Kan., born in Humboldt county, Kansas, a daughter of Avery\r\nand Ellen Tinker, natives of New York State, born at Hastings Center,\r\nthat State. Two children have blessed this union of Albert E. and Anna\r\nMayhew: Avery, born in 1889, and died June 2, 1901; Carl H., born\r\nJanuary, 1891 and associated with his father in business. Carl H.\r\nmarried Miss Vera Snyder, and has one daughter, Lucille, aged two years.\r\n\r\nMr. Mayhew is a stanch Republican in his political affiliations and has\r\ntaken an active and influential part in the affairs of his party since\r\ncoming to Atchison county. In November, 1914, he was the candidate of\r\nhis party for the high office of State representative from this district\r\nand was elected, subsequently serving in the 1915 session of the Kansas\r\nlegislature with such marked ability as a legislator that his course and\r\nactivities conferred distinction upon himself and his constituents.\r\nDuring this session he was a member of the committees on insurance,\r\neducation, legislative appointments, mines and mining, and judicial\r\napportionments. Having always taken a keen interest in educational\r\naffairs, his position as a member of the committee on education gave him\r\nan opportunity to support and advocate legislation which would enhance\r\nthe cause of education throughout the State. He succeeded in having\r\npassed through the house an act requiring the school moneys of the State\r\nto be loaned to farmers. There was plenty of precedence behind an act of\r\nthis character, and the fairness of its provisions is very evident,\r\nalthough it was opposed by the banking interests of the State. The act,\r\nhowever, failed to take its regular course through the senate, because\r\nof the adjournment of the legislative body. It is probable that the act\r\nwill be finally passed at the next session and it is morally certain to\r\nhave strong support, if Mr. Mayhew is again representative from Atchison\r\ncounty. He also introduced and successfully fathered an act, allowing\r\ndistricts to levy higher taxes to provide more amply for bridge building\r\nand road improvements, two provisions, which were of direct benefit to\r\nthe farming interests of the State, inasmuch as the movement for better\r\nhighways is fast gaining ground in Kansas. Mr. Mayhew also assisted in\r\nthe passing of better automobile laws, and took an active part in all\r\nthe deliberations of the legislative body, specializing, however, in\r\nlegislation which had for its ultimate object the betterment of the\r\nschool system of the State. He is a member and trustee of the\r\nPresbyterian church, of Effingham, and is fraternally associated with\r\nthe Odd Fellows and the Modern Woodmen. It is probable that no citizen\r\nis more widely or more favorably known throughout Atchison county than\r\nA. E. Mayhew, and his course as a successful merchant and public\r\nofficial has been such as to favorably commend him to the masses of the\r\npeople, who are always found appreciative of honesty and square dealing\r\non the part of men in public life, whom they honor with their political\r\npreference. He is well worthy of the confidence and trust which have\r\nbeen bestowed upon him by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOSEPH COUPE.\r\n\r\nJoseph Coupe, late of Benton township, was born December 6, 1852, in\r\nUtica, N. Y., and was a son of James and Jane (Latus) Coupe, both of\r\nwhom were born in England. James emigrated from his native land when a\r\nyoung man and located in New York, where he married and reared a family,\r\ncultivating a farm located one mile from the limits of Utica. He died on\r\nhis farm. Joseph was reared on the family farm and attended the Utica\r\npublic schools, receiving an excellent education, after which he took up\r\nthe study of law and was admitted to practice in his home city. He\r\npracticed his profession in Utica until 1881 and then came west and\r\nlocated at Falls City, Neb., where he continued his practice with\r\nconsiderable success until 1906, when he removed with his family to his\r\nfarm, west of Effingham. Failing health induced him to make the change,\r\nand it was thought by his physicians that the open air life would be\r\nbeneficial to him. He died February 10, 1908.\r\n\r\nJudge Coupe was married in 1890 to Miss Anna Mooney, and to this union\r\nwere born six children: Margaret, a graduate of the county high school,\r\nand a teacher in the Effingham public schools; James, who is managing\r\nthe home farm with his mother; Richard, a graduate of the county high\r\nschool; Anna, likewise a high school graduate; Mary, a junior in the\r\nhigh school; and Joseph, a pupil in the Sisters’ school at Effingham.\r\nThe mother of these children was born in Atchison, Kan., confirmed and\r\nbaptized in St. Benedict’s church, and was a daughter of James, born in\r\n1833, and Julia (Ryan) Mooney, born in 1837, both of whom were natives\r\nof Ireland. James Mooney emigrated from Ireland when a youth, was first\r\na resident of Buffalo, N. Y., and in 1857 moved to Nebraska, and was\r\nlater employed at the nursery in Atchison, Kan. From Atchison he removed\r\nto Rulo, Neb., where he still lives. He was married in 1860, and the\r\nfamily lived in Atchison during the Civil war. James and Julia Mooney\r\nwere the parents of five children, namely: Thomas, deceased in March,\r\n1908; John and James, farmers: Margaret, at home in Rulo with her\r\nparents; Mrs. Joseph Coupe.\r\n\r\nPrevious to locating in Kansas, Mr. Coupe had resided on a farm near\r\nFalls City, but was induced to remove to Effingham and here purchased a\r\nfarm of 194 acres west of the city in Benton township, this farm\r\nconsisting of 160 acres of excellent tillable land and thirty-four acres\r\nof pasture. He was prominently identified with civic and political\r\naffairs in Falls City and Richardson county, Nebraska, and had built up\r\na large and lucrative law practice. He was a Democrat in politics and\r\nwas one of the leaders of his party in Nebraska, serving four years as\r\ncounty judge and was successful in re-election to a third term, but\r\nresigned on account of poor health. He was popular with the masses of\r\nthe people and well liked by all who knew him, being universally admired\r\nfor his many excellent qualities of mind and heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JOHN SEATON.\r\n\r\nThe name and accomplishments of the late John Seaton appear prominently\r\nin the history of the constructive period of the development of Kansas\r\nand the city of Atchison. Destiny and natural endowments designed Mr.\r\nSeaton to become a creator and builder; inherent ability also made him a\r\nstatesman and leader of men; design and inducement led him to locate his\r\nenterprise, which was the work of his own hands and brain, in the city\r\nof Atchison. In the course of time he was the gainer, becoming one of\r\nthe first citizens of Kansas, and Kansas and Atchison were doubly\r\ngainers, because of him and his great work. What John Seaton wrought, in\r\nan industrial sense, will live long as a monument to his energy and\r\nenterprise; the record of right doing, honesty, plain living and his\r\nwork in behalf of his fellowmen in the halls of the State legislature\r\nwill live in the minds and hearts of his fellow citizens in the long\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\nJohn Seaton was a builder whose vision of a great industrial enterprise\r\nin the city of the great bend of the Missouri came true in a material\r\nsense, inasmuch as Atchison will continue to benefit through the\r\ncontinued whirring of the industrial wheels which his genius set going.\r\nWhile the evidence of his handiwork is visible, and the smoke of the\r\nfactory which he built will continue to be seen day after day as time\r\ngoes on, the greatest reminder of Mr. Seaton’s life on this earth will\r\nbe the lesson which his manner of living and his strict attention to the\r\nhighest duties of citizenship have left to posterity. Atchison suffered\r\na sincere loss when his demise occurred and his departure from the\r\nrealms of mortal ken created a void which could never be filled,\r\nalthough Mr. Seaton’s work continues to exist after him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Eng. by E. G. Williams & Bro. N. Y._\r\n\r\n  _John Seaton_\r\n]\r\n\r\nJohn Seaton was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, June 11, 1834, a son of John\r\nM., and Elizabeth (Jones) Seaton, the former a native of Virginia and\r\nthe latter having been born in Vermont. John M. Seaton, the father, was\r\na soldier in the Mexican War and was killed in battle at the storming of\r\nthe heights of Cerro Gordo, Old Mexico. When John was three weeks old\r\nhis parents removed from Cincinnati to Louisville, Ky., where his\r\nboyhood days were spent. He was eleven years of age when his father was\r\nkilled on the field of battle. He attended school until he was fifteen\r\nyears of age, and then began learning the trade of a machinist. A few\r\nyears later finds him working as a journeyman machinist in St. Louis,\r\nMo. In 1856 with a cash capital of two dollars and fifty cents, John\r\nSeaton started a foundry at Alton, Ill. A natural aptitude for mechanics\r\nand machinery appliances, combined with pluck, energy and perseverance,\r\nenabled him to make a success of his first undertaking and the\r\nenterprise prospered.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Civil war Mr. Seaton offered his services in\r\ndefense of the Union, and was commissioned a captain of Company B,\r\nTwenty-second regiment, Illinois infantry. His first engagement was the\r\nbattle of Belmont under General Grant, and Captain Seaton was in command\r\nof the skirmish line that opened this engagement. One of the precious\r\npossessions of his family at this day is the personal letter he received\r\nfrom the famous commander, commending him for the efficient manner in\r\nwhich he performed the task allotted to his command. He served for one\r\nyear and then resigned his commission and returned to Alton to take\r\ncharge of his business. After the war Mr. Seaton remained in Alton in\r\ncharge of his foundry until 1872, when he removed to Atchison with his\r\nentire force of fifty employees. He was induced to remove westward by\r\nthe fact that six months previous to the time of his removal to\r\nAtchison, the city had voted $10,000 in bonds to any man who would\r\nestablish a foundry. He accepted the offer and the result was one of the\r\nmost beneficial industries ever located in Atchison. The Seaton foundry\r\ngave employment to over 200 men, and he built up an industry which today\r\nstands without a peer in its line in the West. The secret of Mr.\r\nSeaton’s success lay in the fact that every detail of his business\r\nreceived his direct supervision, and he insisted that only first class\r\nwork be turned out by his factories. For over eighteen years this\r\ncaptain of industry carried his dinner pail with him to the foundry and\r\nworked side by side with his men. He continued doing this after he had\r\nattained to a position of wealth and affluence which enabled him to own\r\na home at the seashore at Orient, L. I., and could have retired from\r\nactive work at any time he chose. None but the finest finished products\r\nwere allowed to leave his establishment, and the name of Seaton and the\r\noutput of his plant are noted over the West for the excellence of the\r\nfinished manufactured materials and for their absolute reliability. In\r\naddition to general architectural work, he filled orders for the Santa\r\nFe, Missouri Pacific and Ft. Scott and Gulf railroads, such as casting\r\nlocomotive wheels, smoke stacks, steam cylinders, etc., all known as\r\nlocomotive finished material products. The business of his large\r\nestablishment in Atchison was built up until it amounted to over\r\n$250,000 annually, and the plant covered an area of 700×400 feet. Mr.\r\nSeaton was in business continually from 1856 until the time of his\r\ndemise, January 12, 1912.\r\n\r\nThe activities of this noted citizen of Atchison were not confined\r\nentirely to his business, but he took an active and influential part in\r\ncivic and political affairs after his advent in Atchison. His career\r\nshowed that he possessed statesmanship ability of a high order. For a\r\nperiod of eighteen years Mr. Seaton was a member of the Kansas State\r\nlegislature, and so great was his influence in the house, and so long\r\nand distinguished was his service that he became known throughout the\r\nState as the “Father of the House.” His name is associated with many of\r\nthe important measures enacted into law by the State legislature, among\r\nthem being the binding twine factory law, which act is responsible for\r\nthe establishment of a plant for the manufacture of binder twine at the\r\nState penitentiary. He probably did more for the success of the\r\n“Douglass House,” during the legislative trouble of 1893 than any other\r\nmember of the Republican body. As a citizen and a legislator he enjoyed\r\nthe respect and esteem of the people of Kansas without regard to\r\npolitical affiliations. He was opposed to the dominance of “trusts and\r\nmonopoly,” and it was his firm conviction that the great corporations\r\nwere devoid of feeling of a personal nature.\r\n\r\nApril 9, 1857, Mr. Seaton was married to Miss Charlotte E. Tuthill, of\r\nAlton, Ill., and this marriage was blessed with five children: Mrs.\r\nLillie M. Hendrickson, of Atchison; John C. in California; Mary, wife of\r\nDr. W. H. Condit, of Kansas City; Mrs. Nellie Taber (Seaton) Byram,\r\ndeceased, and George L., married Amy Cox, of Weston, Mo., and resides on\r\nSouth Fourth street, Atchison; John C. Seaton married Gertrude Hickman,\r\nof Coffeyville, Kan. and resides in Kansas City and Los Angeles, Cal.;\r\nMrs. Charlotte E. (Tuthill) Seaton was born in Alton, Ill., November 10,\r\n1840, a daughter of Pardon Taber Tuthill, who was born and reared on\r\nLong Island, N. Y., and was a scion of one of the oldest American\r\nfamilies. The great-great-grandfather of Mrs. Seaton, John Tuthill,\r\nknown as Pilgrim John Tuthill, came from England with early settlers to\r\nLong Island. The home built by Pilgrim John on Long Island in the early\r\npart of the eighteenth century is still standing in a good state of\r\npreservation. The ancestral home of the Tuthills is located in the\r\nvillage of Orient, Long Island. On the maternal side an ancestor of Mrs.\r\nSeaton, named Capt. Andrew Englis, commanded a company in the Revolution\r\nand was a great patriot. Pardon Taber Tuthill was a pioneer in Alton,\r\nIll. He was a contractor and builder and in his later years devoted his\r\ntime and talents to horticulture. He was continually experimenting and\r\ndeveloped several new varieties of fruit. He was blessed with a\r\nscientific mind and became famous as a horticulturist.\r\n\r\nJohn Seaton was a member of John A. Martin Post, No. 93, Grand Army of\r\nthe Republic, the Loyal Legion and the Knights of Pythias lodges.\r\nThrough him the Enterprise theater was rebuilt and remodeled in\r\nAtchison, and he was always found in the forefront of public movements\r\nto advance the interests of his home city. Socially Mr. Seaton was a\r\ngenial, approachable, unassuming gentleman, whose pride was manifest\r\nconcerning his Civil war record and the fact that he had amassed wealth\r\nand attained a leading position in the civic life of his adopted State\r\nthrough his own efforts, and built up his fortunes from the ground. He\r\nwas a man of undoubted integrity and was a noble character whose demise\r\nwas sincerely mourned by the whole city of Atchison. He was a kind and\r\nindulgent husband and father. In his passing Kansas lost one of her best\r\nand most widely known statesmen and Atchison one of her most useful\r\ncitizens. His was a life well spent in behalf of the city and State\r\nwhere his name will long be remembered and revered as one of the honored\r\npioneers of a widely known city and great State which he helped to\r\ncreate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AARON S. BEST.\r\n\r\nIt is meet that considerable space in this history of Atchison county be\r\ndevoted to the stories of the lives of real pioneers of the county. The\r\nold pioneers were the salt of the earth, and a stronger or more vigorous\r\nrace of men, never conquered a wilderness. In the class of the real, old\r\npioneer settlers, comes Aaron S. Best, retired farmer, of Effingham,\r\nKan. Captain Best has lived in Atchison county for nearly fifty-five\r\nyears, and has seen the country transformed from a vast tract of pasture\r\nand grazing land to a region of fertile and productive farms, and well\r\nbuilt towns and cities. During all these years he has taken an active\r\nand prominent part in county affairs, and in his younger days was a\r\npolitical leader in his own neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAaron S. Best was born June 27, 1839, in Clinton county, Pa., a son of\r\nJohn W. and Catharine (Schaefer) Best, of German descent, and native\r\nborn and reared in Pennsylvania. John W. Best was born in 1809 and died\r\nin 1881. He was the son of Peter Best, a native of Pennsylvania, of\r\nGerman parentage. In the year 1860, John W. Best, accompanied by his\r\nwife and seven children, crossed the country to find a new home in\r\nKansas. He had made a trip to Atchison county in the previous year, and,\r\nafter carefully looking over the ground, made up his mind that the\r\ncountry had a great future, and he decided to move his family so as to\r\nmake a permanent home in Kansas. The Best family arrived in Atchison in\r\nMarch of 1861, and at once moved to a farm in old Monrovia. In June of\r\nthe same year, the wife and mother died, at the age of forty-five years.\r\nThe following children were born to John W. Best and wife: Mary and\r\nElvina, deceased, in Pennsylvania; Henry, living at Parr, Tex.; Louis,\r\nLuther and Reuben, deceased; Mrs. Henrietta Lamberson, of Argentry,\r\nArk.; and Michael, deceased.\r\n\r\nAaron Best was twenty-one years of age when the family removed to\r\nAtchison county. Being a Free State advocate, it was only natural that\r\nhe take some part in the struggle which finally made Kansas a free\r\nState. When General Price’s threatened invasion of Kansas seemed\r\nimminent, he assisted in raising a company of militia among his\r\nneighbors and was chosen captain. This company marched to Westport, and\r\ntook part in the famous engagement which resulted in Price’s retreat to\r\nthe southward. Captain Best was in command of Company F, Twelfth\r\nregiment, Kansas cavalry. Only two companies of the Twelfth regiment\r\nwere under fire, and Company F was one of these, Capt. Asa Barnes’\r\ncompany being the other actively engaged. Captain Best’s horse was shot\r\nfrom under him and badly crippled.\r\n\r\nAfter coming to Kansas, he spent one year assisting his father on the\r\nhome farm, and then moved to a farm of his own, south of Monrovia, which\r\nhe developed from raw prairie land to a very productive farm, residing\r\non until 1907, when he rented his land holdings and retired to a\r\ncomfortable home in Effingham. The first land which Mr. Best owned was\r\nbought by his father for $750, and he farmed this on the share plan for\r\nsix years, after which he paid his father $2,000 for 140 acres. His next\r\npurchase was eighty acres of land nearby, and he continued to add to his\r\nland possessions until he was the owner of 275 acres in all. In the\r\nspring of 1914 Mr. Best sold his farm land for $21,000. His farm was one\r\nof the best improved in Atchison county, and naturally brought a good,\r\nround price, because of the good condition of the buildings and of the\r\nfertility of the soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Best was married in February, 1860, to Malinda Bricker, and to this\r\nunion have been born one son and three daughters, as follows: Mrs. Ella\r\nRebecca Sharp, living at Helena, Mo., and mother of two children, Albert\r\nand Twila; Mrs. Mary C. Bonnell, living on a farm southeast of\r\nEffingham, and who has eight children, Nellie, Edith, Grace, Ruth,\r\nCatharine, Lea, Claude, Malinda; Mrs. Emma Wood, of Council Grove, Kan.,\r\nand mother of four children, Clara, Beulah Morris, Ralph, Esther; John a\r\nmerchant, of Monrovia, Kan., father of three children, Leota, Hazel, and\r\nBlanche. The mother of these children was born in Hanover township,\r\nDaulphin county, Pennsylvania, December 15, 1837, and was a daughter of\r\nJoseph and Rebecca (Lohs) Bricker, both of whom were of Pennsylvania\r\nGerman ancestry, and died in their Pennsylvania home.\r\n\r\nMr. Best has always been allied with the Republican party, and has been\r\na stanch advocate of Republican principles for a long period of years.\r\nHe and his wife are members of the Methodist Episcopal church and\r\ncontribute generously to the support of that denomination. He is\r\nfraternally affiliated with the Odd Fellows Lodge and Encampment, No. 5,\r\nand the Modern Woodmen. Physically and mentally, Mr. Best is a\r\nremarkably well preserved man, when one considers his age and the fact\r\nthat he endured so many hardships in his first struggles to attain to\r\nthe position of affluence and comfort which he enjoys at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LOUIS C. ORR.\r\n\r\nFaithfulness to duty on the part of public officials is always\r\nappreciated by the people, and an official who regards his office as\r\nother than a sinecure, is recognized as honest, capable and well\r\nmeaning. In Louis C. Orr, postmaster of the city of Atchison, Kan., the\r\npatrons and citizens of Atchison have a capable and conscientious public\r\nservant, whose sole interest is to see that the affairs of this\r\nimportant Government office are conducted smoothly, and for the\r\nconvenience of the patrons of the postoffice. Although, in times past,\r\nthe Atchison postoffice has been looked upon as a sinecure, operated as\r\na well oiled piece of Government machinery with an efficient and well\r\ntrained force, Mr. Orr, since taking over the duties of his position,\r\nhas demonstrated that he can work as hard and efficiently as any of the\r\nmany employees making up the postoffice force. Probably no postoffice in\r\nthe State of Kansas is better conducted, or the welfare of the patrons\r\nmore carefully looked after than the Atchison postoffice, and credit is\r\ndue Mr. Orr for his diligent application to the duties of his office\r\nsince his appointment.\r\n\r\nLouis C. Orr, postmaster of Atchison, was born August 3, 1857, in\r\nMcGregor, Iowa, a son of James and Man Elizabeth (Underhill) Orr,\r\nconcerning whom further mention will be found in the biography of James\r\nW. Orr, brother of Louis C., in this volume. When Louis C. was eight\r\nyears of age the family removed from Iowa to Niles, Mich. Louis C. and\r\nhis brother James W. knew what poverty was in their youthful days, and\r\nshared their hardships in common. Louis C. was ambitious to obtain an\r\neducation, and at an early age was compelled, by force of circumstances\r\nover which he had no control, to practically earn his own living and the\r\nwherewithal to obtain an education. For some years he and James W.\r\npooled their earnings and worked together for their mutual benefit, and\r\nto this day this trait of brotherly devotion is present. Louis C.\r\nattended school until he had attained the age of eighteen years, and he\r\nthen entered a drug store at Niles, Mich., in the capacity of clerk. He\r\nremained in Michigan until 1885, when he came to Atchison. Kan., where\r\nhis brother, James W., had preceded him in 1881. Mr. Orr entered the\r\nGovernment railroad mail service, and was employed in this capacity on\r\nthe Santa Fe Railway System, on the run from Atchison to Topeka, during\r\nGrover Cleveland’s first administration. He then left the railway mail\r\nservice and was employed as clerk in the drug store of A. W. Stevens for\r\nthe following period of eight years. For the six years following he was\r\nin charge of the paint department of the McPike Drug Company, a\r\nwholesale drug firm then operating in Atchison, and since removed to\r\nKansas City, Mo. For four years, from 1907 to 1911, he served as city\r\ncollector of Atchison. He was engaged in the real estate and fire\r\ninsurance business until January, 1915. Mr. Orr was appointed postmaster\r\nof Atchison December 29, 1914, by President Wilson, to take effect\r\nJanuary 4, 1915, although Mr. Orr did not begin his duties until January\r\n15, 1915.\r\n\r\nMr. Orr was married in 1886 to Mary Isabelle Smith, of Richmond, Ind., a\r\ndaughter of John P. and Mary (Sedgwick) Smith, residents of Richmond,\r\nInd. One son has been born to this marriage, Richard Sedgwick Orr, born\r\nin 1888, and at present employed as manager for the Standard Oil Company\r\nin Atchison.\r\n\r\nLouis C. Orr is a Democrat and is affiliated with the Christian\r\nScientist church. For the past twenty-five years he has been a member of\r\nLodge No. 127, Ancient Order of United Workmen. It can be said of him\r\nthat he is courteous, efficient and obliging to all with whom he is\r\nbrought in contact.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CARL LUDWIG BECKMAN.\r\n\r\nSuccessful as an agriculturist, and again achieving success as a live\r\nstock buyer and shipper, is a summary of the life and accomplishments of\r\nCarl Ludwig Beckman, one of the best known and progressive citizens of\r\nEffingham, Kan. Mr. Beckman’s live stock operations invoke the buying\r\nand shipping of over fifty carloads of live stock yearly. In addition to\r\nhis business dealings, he also looks after his fine farm of 200 acres in\r\nBenton township.\r\n\r\nMr. Beckman was born April 2, 1861, in Quincy, Ill. As the name\r\nindicates, he is the son of German parents, his father, William Beckman,\r\nhaving been born in Germany, in 1830, and was unfortunately killed by a\r\nstroke of lightning in Burlington, Iowa, in 1863. When a young man,\r\nWilliam Beckman left his native land to seek his fortune in this\r\ncountry. He located at Quincy, Ill., where he married Elizabeth Kipp,\r\nwho bore him four children, and was also born in Germany in 1824.\r\nWilliam Beckman removed his family to Burlington, Iowa, in about 1862.\r\nThe four children born to this couple were: William, a resident of\r\nParnell, Atchison county, Kansas; Mrs. Hannah Buhrmaster, living on a\r\nfarm in Benton township; Minnie, and Carl Ludwig, with whom this review\r\nis directly concerned. The mother of these children later married Henry\r\nVollmer, a farmer, in Iowa, who gave her and the children a good home\r\nand left his widow well provided for. Mrs. Vollmer, mother of C. L.,\r\nresides at Mediapolis, Iowa.\r\n\r\nWhen Carl was twenty years of age he left the farm in Iowa, and came to\r\nKansas in 1881, and in partnership with his brother, William, rented a\r\nfarm near Effingham for thirteen years, dissolving partnership in 1894.\r\nThrough purchase and by inheritance, on his wife’s part, Mr. Beckman and\r\nhis wife came into possession of 200 acres of land in 1894, upon which\r\nthey resided until 1908. In that year they bought a small farm of\r\nthirty-five acres, one mile west of Effingham, upon which they resided\r\nfor three years, and then made a permanent home in Effingham. Since 1908\r\nMr. Beckman has been engaged in the buying and shipping of live stock,\r\nwith Robert M. Thomas as a partner in the enterprise, and has been very\r\nsuccessful in this business, being an accurate judge of live stock and\r\nkeeping abreast of market conditions.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1894 to Miss Lebeldine Gersbach, born in Atchison\r\ncounty in 1863, a daughter of Samuel and Catharine Gersbach, both of\r\nwhom were natives of Germany, and, after emigrating from their native\r\ncountry to America, settled in Atchison county as early as 1854, and\r\nwere among the earliest pioneers of Kansas. Mr. Gersbach preëmpted land\r\nand built up a fine farm which is now owned by Mr. and Mrs. Beckman. Two\r\nchildren were born of this marriage: Rosa, aged twenty years, and a\r\nstudent in the Atchison county high school, class of 1916; and Pearl,\r\naged seventeen, also a student in the high school, class of 1916.\r\n\r\nMr. Beckman is a Republican in politics, and takes an interest in the\r\ncivic and political affairs of his home town and county.

This thought and belief is comforting alike to the\r\ndying and the bereaved ones left behind to mourn their earthly loss for\r\nthe time being. Longfellow has written: “Life is real, life is earnest,\r\nand the grave is not its goal; dust thou art, to dust returneth, was not\r\nwritten of the soul.” So thought and so lived the late Capt. James\r\nGranville Morrow, who at the time of his demise was the oldest living\r\npioneer resident of Atchison, and a man famed for his upright life and\r\nbeloved for his good and kindly deeds. Life was very “real and earnest”\r\nto Captain Morrow and he enjoyed his earthly existence to the fullest\r\nextent, the latter years of his residence in Atchison being the fullest\r\nand best of all, in the sense that he indulged his taste and talents to\r\ndoing things which he loved, all the while being surrounded by a loving\r\nwife and children whose respect and love he had to comfort him through\r\nthe greater part of his long and useful life. Captain Morrow lived in\r\nsuch a manner as to endear him to all of his associates and he will long\r\nbe remembered as one of the noted figures of the pioneer and the present\r\nera of Kansas development. It is meet that the life story of this truly\r\nnoble citizen be recorded in these annals of his county and city for the\r\ninspiration and encouragement of the present and coming posterity for\r\nall time to come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Eng. by E. G. Williams & Bro. N. Y._\r\n\r\n  _James G. Morrow_\r\n]\r\n\r\nJames Granville Morrow was born on a farm in Wayne county, Kentucky,\r\nJune 27, 1827, a son of Jeremiah and Lydia (Holder) Morrow, both of whom\r\nwere born and reared in Kentucky. Jeremiah Morrow was the son of Matthew\r\nMorrow, a native of Virginia, who was one of the early pioneers of\r\nKentucky, and of Scotch descent, his ancestors having emigrated from\r\nScotland to America in the early colonial period of American history.\r\nJeremiah Morrow, father of James G., was born in 1802, and after his\r\nremoval to Kentucky married Lydia Holder. Six sons and two daughters\r\nwere born to Jeremiah Morrow and wife, only one of whom survives, Mrs.\r\nW. H. Crisp, residing in Kentucky. Their children were as follows:\r\nMahala, wife of Rev. W. H. Crisp, of Kentucky; Floyd, deceased; James\r\nGranville, the subject of this review; Nimrod, deceased; Riley, William,\r\nNancy, deceased wife of John Pennington; Percy, deceased. Granville\r\nMorrow spent his boyhood days on the family farm in Wayne county,\r\nKentucky, and at the age of sixteen years was sent to a select school.\r\nHe made his home with his parents until he attained his majority and\r\nthen set out to make his own way in the world. He dealt quite\r\nextensively in horses which he drove from Kentucky to Georgia. He was\r\nalso associated with his brothers in raising, purchasing and selling\r\nhogs, which they drove 400 miles into Georgia, where they were sold to\r\nthe Georgia planters. Sometimes a single planter would buy 500 head and\r\nthe price ranged from eight to nine dollars per 100 pounds, live weight.\r\nThe Morrow brothers frequently drove as high as 13,000 head, traveling\r\nonly seven miles a day. There were no railroads in those days, but the\r\ncountry was dotted with stations. Hog cholera did not bother swine in\r\nthose days and it was Captain Morrow’s frequent expression that hog\r\ncholera was a product of civilization and high breeding, and, although\r\nthe hogs were driven as far as 400 miles they did not lose weight on the\r\ntrip. The business of the Morrow brothers was not always profitable,\r\nhowever, and they lost money on some of the trips. Mr. Morrow abandoned\r\nthe business in 1850, and in 1854 arrived in Atchison en route to\r\nCalifornia, but he did not go any farther. On April 5, 1854, he arrived\r\nat Rushville Landing, now East Atchison. This was shortly before Kansas\r\nwas opened for settlement, and the only man living at that time on the\r\ntownsite of Atchison was George Million, who operated a rope ferry\r\nacross the Missouri river. Mr. Morrow found on landing at Atchison that\r\nthe overland train which he expected to join en route to the far West\r\nhad left, and, as he was ill he decided to wait for the next train.\r\nCaptain Morrow ate his first dinner in Kansas with Samuel Dixon at Dixon\r\nSpring, now included in the city of Atchison. The food was ladled out of\r\na common kettle to which all the diners had access without style or\r\ninvitation other than “help yourself.” A tree trunk sawed off smooth\r\nanswered the purpose of a table on which the meal was served. While\r\nwaiting he found a job with Million and decided to remain in Kansas. In\r\nthe fall of 1854, he, with John Alcorn, bought out Portumous Lamb’s\r\nferry boat which was operated by horse power and a tread-mill, and from\r\nthat time on for seventeen consecutive years Mr. Morrow plied his ferry\r\nbetween Atchison and Winthrop. In the fall of 1855 he began operating a\r\nside-wheel steam ferry which had been brought here from Brownsville, Pa.\r\nIn 1857 he became captain of the steam ferry, “Ida,” later running the\r\nsteam ferry, “Pomeroy,” after which he went to Brownsville, Pa., where\r\nhe built the transfer boat, “William Osborne,” remaining there eight\r\nmonths while the work was in progress. When he brought the “William\r\nOsborne” to Atchison it was loaded with 300 tons of rails for the\r\nCentral Branch of the Missouri Pacific railroad, now the Northern Kansas\r\nDivision. This boat also conveyed across the Missouri river the first\r\nlocomotives used on the road after its construction.\r\n\r\nNot long after his arrival in Atchison Captain Morrow began to\r\naccumulate land, and in 1869 turned his attention to farming, retiring\r\nfrom the steamboat business entirely in 1871. He accumulated 1,240 acres\r\nof rich bottom lands in the Missouri river bottoms near East Atchison\r\nwhich has never failed to produce a crop and is very valuable. He\r\nformerly owned a section of land in Osage county, Kansas, near Lebo. He\r\nalso was the owner of two valuable farms on the Atchison side of the\r\nriver, 320 acres near Jacksboro, Texas, and owned considerable real\r\nestate in the city, all of which has been left to his widow in trust for\r\nhis children and heirs. He was very successful as a wheat grower, and in\r\nthis way gained the greater part of his working capital. He erected a\r\nbeautiful home called “Enidan Heights” at Eighth and U streets, on the\r\nsouth side of Atchison, where he spent his declining years in peace and\r\ncomfort. About 1875 he opened a general store in East Atchison which he\r\nconducted until 1883. Those were still pioneer days, and the settlers in\r\nthe vicinity were poor and sometimes were unable to pay for the goods\r\nthey needed. The captain’s big heart and generous impulses frequently\r\nled him to extend credit to patrons whom he knew would not be able to\r\npay for their purchases, and it was a favorite expression of his when\r\nhis clerk would report to him that a poor man wished credit, “Gracious\r\nto goodness, if we don’t let him have the stuff he’ll starve to death.”\r\nThe captain sold hundreds of dollars’ worth of goods which were probably\r\nnever paid for, but his good heart would not permit him to see a fellow\r\ncreature in want for the necessities of life. This trait of kindness was\r\nthe predominating characteristic of his life and endeared him to\r\nhundreds of people. After quitting the mercantile business Captain\r\nMorrow devoted himself entirely to his farming interests and his\r\ntransfer business which he established in 1888 with his partners, later\r\nbecoming the sole owner of the business. He retired entirely from active\r\nbusiness pursuits and his farming in 1910 and spent the most of his time\r\nworking around the gardens of his fine home in Atchison. For years it\r\nwas his custom to drive back and forth to his big farm on the Missouri\r\nside and he was gradually persuaded to abandon this activity. His demise\r\noccurred December 2, 1915, after a brief illness, beginning with an\r\nattack of la grippe, his great age and depleted vitality militating\r\nagainst his recovery.\r\n\r\nJames Granville Morrow was married November 20, 1874, to Miss Sarah J.\r\nGeorge, and this happy marriage was blessed with the following children:\r\nDella, born November 11, 1875, and died in 1904; Mary Etta, born in\r\nMissouri March 17, 1880, dying October 2, 1880, and who is buried in\r\nOrearville cemetery, Saline county, Missouri; James Granville George,\r\nborn September 16, 1878, married Ethel Worrell, and is the father of\r\nfour children: James Granville, Jr., John Worrell, Frances and Robert\r\nGeorge; Nadine, wife of John Raymond Woodhouse, who lives with Mrs.\r\nMorrow, of Atchison, and mother of John Granville, born December 16,\r\n1914; James G. Morrow resides in Buchanan county, Missouri, and has\r\ncharge of the immense Morrow farm in the Missouri bottoms. The children\r\nof Captain and Mrs. Morrow have all been well educated and afforded\r\nevery facility for mind cultivation. Mrs. Nadine Woodhouse was educated\r\nin Mount St. Scholastica Academy and the College Preparatory School of\r\nAtchison, after which she completed her studies at Central College of\r\nMissouri. Miss Della Morrow studied in Mount St. Scholastica Academy,\r\nMidland and Central colleges, and Washington University, at St. Louis,\r\nand was a bright and talented young lady prior to her demise. James\r\nMorrow, the son, studied in the Atchison public schools and Midland\r\nCollege. The mother of these children, Mrs. Sarah J. (George) Morrow,\r\nwas born March 30, 1853, near Orearville, Saline county, Missouri, a\r\ndaughter of Dr. James Jameson George, a native of Prince William county,\r\nVirginia. Dr. George was born in Virginia November 25, 1810, a son of\r\nWilliam Henry George, a soldier in the War of 1812, who moved from\r\nVirginia to Hardin county, Kentucky, in 1816 with his brothers, Moses\r\nand Lindsey George, who settled at Shelbyville, Ky. The mother of Dr.\r\nGeorge was a member of the Jameson family, an old Virginia family. The\r\nancestry of both the George and Jameson families goes back to the pre-\r\nRevolutionary days of the Virginia colony. Dr. J. J. George was a\r\ngraduate of the Transylvania College at Bairdstown, Ky., and also\r\nstudied at Lexington, Ky. He was married in 1841 at Mt. Sterling, Ky.,\r\nto Mary (Catlett) Orear, a daughter of Robert Catlett Orear, who was\r\nborn in Mt. Sterling. Ky., January 30, 1814, and departed this life\r\nMarch 27, 1876, in Johnson county, Missouri. Dr. J. J. and Mary George\r\nwere the parents of the following children: Robert died in June, 1905,\r\non his ranch in Coffey county, Kansas; Joel S., who resides at Peace\r\nRiver Crossing, Alberta, Canada; Mary E., wife of J. H. Russell, died\r\nJune 28, 1911; Mrs. Malinda Morrison, of Tecumseh, Okla.; Benjamin\r\nFranklin, born in Saline county, settled in Coffey county, Kansas, and\r\nnow resides in Denver, Colo.; Mrs. James Granville Morrow; two who died\r\nin infancy; James Nelson contracted fever at Central College, and died\r\nOctober 26, 1875, aged twenty-one years and twenty-nine days; Lee Davis,\r\na ranchman, of Coffey county, Kansas. Four of these children were born\r\nin Kentucky, and the last four were born in Missouri, where the family\r\nremoved in 1850.\r\n\r\nDr. George was a minister of the Gospel and a member of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal conference in Kentucky from 1838 to 1839. He came to Missouri\r\nto farm and preach the Gospel, but was impressed very early in his\r\nwestern career with the woeful dearth of skilled medical care for the\r\nsick and ailing of the backwoods country, and was frequently called to\r\nthe bedside of people who were supposed to be dying, and whom he\r\nrealized could be easily saved with some medical attention. Fired with\r\nzeal to assist an unfortunate and suffering people, he conceived the\r\nworthy idea of studying medicine, so that he could be of material\r\nassistance to his people other than in a religious sense. He returned to\r\nKentucky and entered the Medical College at Lexington. After completing\r\nhis course he returned to Saline county, Missouri, and engaged in the\r\npractice of his profession until old age came upon him. He then removed\r\nto Cass county, Missouri, and became a local minister. His was a long\r\nand useful life, every matured year of which was given in behalf of his\r\nfellowmen, unselfishly and devotedly. He was one of the noted\r\nmissionaries of the early days in Missouri and extended the word of the\r\nGospel to the remotest settlements. He organized churches and Sunday\r\nschools where they seemed needed most and his work called him to preach\r\nthe Word in log houses and the most primitive habitations of man. Dr.\r\nGeorge was deeply in love with his great work, and loved the people, and\r\nworked tirelessly for their well being in a religious and practical way.\r\nHe departed this life August 4, 1875. The last public utterance which he\r\nmade was when he spoke to a Sunday school assemblage in Coffey county,\r\nKansas, in the village of Key West. His end was peaceful and tranquil,\r\nand the departure of this good man’s soul to the realms beyond mortal\r\nkin marked the passing of one of the truly great men of the western\r\ncountry whose work will go on and on forever. Dr. George and Captain\r\nMorrow became great friends in the early sixties.\r\n\r\nOn Thanksgiving day of 1915, just the day before Mr. and Mrs. Morrow’s\r\nforty-first wedding anniversary, the captain’s last illness began which\r\nresulted in his passing away. His burial occurred on December 4 from\r\nTrinity Episcopal Church, Rev. Otis E. Gray officiating, with the\r\nMasonic lodge of Atchison conducting burial service at the grave. He was\r\nfor many years a Mason and was greatly interested in the Masonic\r\nfraternity, rarely being absent from the lodge meetings, his last spoken\r\nregret having been that he would be unable to attend the ceremonies held\r\nat the laying of the cornerstone of the new Masonic Temple in Atchison.\r\nThe last five years of Captain Morrow’s life were perhaps the most\r\nsatisfactory and the happiest of his existence. His years of retirement,\r\nalthough few as compared with that of most men, were spent almost\r\nentirely at his beautiful home, with occasional visits to his farm\r\nlands. He was loath to retire, and did so only at the urgent insistence\r\nof his devoted wife, and for quite a long time after he was eighty years\r\nof age he would insist on driving across the river to his farm. He took\r\nthe greatest pleasure with his grandchildren, and especially with his\r\nnamesake. In his later years he became a specialist in gardening and\r\nfruit growing merely for his own satisfaction and would frequently\r\nsurprise his family with some very choice and rare fruits grown in his\r\ngardens and orchards. From his orchard of peach trees he gathered over\r\n400 bushels of peaches in one season, and also set out an apple orchard\r\nwhich he attended assiduously. He became a disciple of the famous Luther\r\nBurbank and was a member of the Luther Burbank corporation. Through the\r\nexercise of his skill as a fruit grower be produced several kinds of\r\nrare berries and was continually experimenting in small fruits and\r\nvegetable growing. It was fitting that the life of Captain Morrow should\r\nclose in such a manner and that during his last years he was permitted\r\nto indulge himself in his favorite pursuits, surrounded with the loving\r\nand watchful career of his devoted wife, who was always his confidant\r\nand adviser, and to whom he went in time of stress or trouble for\r\ncomfort and advice. His was a life well spent and his memory will live\r\nlong in the hearts and minds of those who knew him best.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ORLANDO C. SCOVILLE.\r\n\r\nIn the northeast part of Benton township, in a comfortable farm home on\r\nsection 11, range 18, there resides the oldest pioneer settler of that\r\nsection of the county, the review of whose career takes one back to the\r\ndays of the Civil war when he shouldered a musket in defense of the\r\nUnion, and to the early days of Kansas history when the long freight\r\ntrains hauled by oxen and mules were leaving Atchison for the far West.\r\nWe are reminded of the Indian troubles which beset the hardy freighters\r\nas they convoyed their treasures across the wide reaches of prairie and\r\nmountain. In all these things Orlando C. Scoville, Union veteran, old-\r\ntime freighter, and pioneer farmer, participated, and it is meet that\r\nthe story of his life and adventurous career be recorded for the\r\nentertainment of succeeding generations of men and women in order that\r\nthey might know how a wilderness was redeemed and what manner of men\r\ntheir forefathers were and whence they came.\r\n\r\nOrlando C. Scoville was born February 4, 1846, in Cook county, Illinois,\r\non a farm located just twenty-two miles from the city of Chicago. His\r\nfather was William Scoville, born in 1820, at Watertown, N. Y., a son of\r\nAbijah Scoville, a native of Connecticut, and a scion of an old New\r\nEngland family. Abijah Scoville was a carpenter by trade and his art was\r\ntransmitted to his descendants. William Scoville received a good\r\neducation in his native State, and taught school in New York when a\r\nyoung man seventeen years old. As early as 1842 he came west, to Cook\r\ncounty, Illinois, and owned a farm in that county which he cultivated\r\nuntil 1865 when he came to Atchison, Kan., where he first engaged in the\r\nhandling of live stock. Later he was in the lumber business with a Mr.\r\nMcCoy, who later sold out to Henry T. Smith, and he and Smith conducted\r\na wagon and lumber business on Utah avenue, just east of the old\r\nEpiscopal church, between Fourth and Fifth streets. William eventually\r\nsold out his business and moved to a farm in Benton township, south of\r\nwhere his son, O. C., lives, and there died in December, 1891. Previous\r\nto removing to his farm he was foreman of the Hixon Lumber Company’s\r\ninterests in Atchison. The mother of Orlando C. was Lucinda Lasher, whom\r\nWilliam Scoville married in New York, and who removed to Arrington after\r\nher husband’s death, and there died in November, 1893, at the age of\r\nseventy-five years. William and Lucinda Scoville were the parents of\r\nseven children, two of whom died in infancy: Imogene, wife of A. W.\r\nMulligan, of Blue Rapids, Kan.; Orlando C.; Eulalie, died in Atchison in\r\n1866, and is buried in Oak Hill cemetery; Freeman, a railroad engineer\r\nfor many years, and who died at Arrington, in 1911; Giles, a successful\r\nlaw practitioner, located in Chicago, and who studied law under the late\r\nSenator John J. Ingalls.\r\n\r\nO. C. Scoville was reared to young manhood on the farm in Cook county,\r\nIllinois, and when eighteen years of age enlisted (1864) in Company B,\r\nOne Hundred and Thirty-second regiment, Illinois infantry. He served for\r\nsix months in the Army of the Tennessee, under General Thomas, and took\r\npart in the several hard-fought battles, among them being the battle and\r\nsiege of Atlanta. His command started on the march with Sherman, to the\r\nsea, but were turned back by department orders. After his war service\r\nexpired he came to Atchison and joined the family. His first occupation\r\nin Atchison was the operating of a wagon shop, just across the street\r\nfrom the Blair Mill, and it is a matter of history that his shop was\r\nused as the first depot of the Central Branch railroad, then building.\r\nHe ran the wagon shop for two years and then made two trips across the\r\ncontinent in the capacity of freighter and convoying a herd of cattle.\r\nIn 1867 he was one of the freighters in charge of the first train sent\r\nover the Smoky Hill route for Butterfield to Denver. The live stock was\r\nrun off by the Indians during this trip, and Butterfield came out and\r\nfound them after four weeks’ search; his next trip was to Salt Lake\r\nCity. In 1868, he with others, drove a herd of milch cows which had been\r\nsold by McCoy to a man named Murray, and consigned to him in California.\r\nThis trip required eighteen months to consummate, and they were forced\r\nto winter in the Antelope valley on Walker river. After taking the\r\ncattle to their destination he returned across the mountains to Reno,\r\nNev., and there boarded the train for the rest of the journey home, Reno\r\nat that time being the western terminus of the railway. During 1869 he\r\nworked for one year in the engineering corps of the Santa Fe railroad,\r\nand in that winter his father bought his present farm in Benton\r\ntownship. In the fall of 1872 he moved to the farm where he has resided\r\ncontinuously for the past forty-three years. In 1893 he bought the farm\r\nformerly owned by the family and has increased his acreage until he and\r\nhis son are the owners of 400 acres of land, the latter owning 180\r\nacres, upon which formerly stood three sets of farm buildings, one of\r\nwhich was destroyed by fire in April, 1915. His present residence was\r\nerected in 1893.\r\n\r\nMr. Scoville was married in Atchison May 8, 1873, to Virginia Williams,\r\nborn in Greenbrier county, Virginia, in 1854, and a daughter of\r\nAlexander Williams. Her father died when she was very young and she came\r\nwith her mother and stepfather to Missouri in the early pioneer days\r\nwhen her mother died and she was adopted by Mrs. Miller, a music\r\nteacher, of Atchison, Kan. Three children were born to this union,\r\nnamely: Katie died in infancy; William C., born August 10, 1875, married\r\nMyrtle Lollar, and has two children, Earl, born December 13, 1911, and\r\nAlice, born May 16, 1914. William C. is the only living son of Orlando\r\nC. Scoville. Mrs. Scoville died in October, 1913.\r\n\r\nThis sturdy pioneer has been a Republican ever since he cast his first\r\nvote, and is one of the true blue variety who prides himself on being a\r\n“stand-patter,” who believes thoroughly in the principles of his party\r\nand will never desert the standard of Republicanism. He has never held\r\noffice and has never been a seeker after political preferment; has never\r\nbeen a party to a law suit, never served on a jury, and has been called\r\nonly once in his lifetime to the witness stand. He has endeavored at all\r\ntimes to live at peace with all mankind and has succeeded to such an\r\nextent that at a ripe old age, this pioneer settler of Atchison county\r\nis living in peace and comfort in the home which he created out of a\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nMr. Scoville cast his first vote for Abraham Lincoln in St. Louis, in\r\n1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JOHN JAMES INGALLS.\r\n\r\nJohn James Ingalls, author, lawyer, and United States Senator, was born\r\nin Middleton, Mass., December 29, 1833, a son of Elias T. and Eliza\r\n(Chase) Ingalls. He was descended from Edmond Ingalls, who, with his\r\nbrother, Francis, founded the town of Lynn, Mass., in 1628. His father\r\nwas a first cousin of Mehitable Ingalls, the grandmother of the late\r\nPresident Garfield. His mother was a descendant of Aquilla Chase, who\r\nsettled in New Hampshire in 1630. Chief Justice Chase was of this\r\nfamily. After going through the public schools Ingalls attended Williams\r\nCollege, at Williamstown, Mass., graduating in 1855. He then studied law\r\nand was admitted to the bar in 1857. The next year he came to Kansas and\r\nin 1859 was a member of the Wyandotte constitutional convention. In 1860\r\nhe was secretary of the territorial council and was also secretary of\r\nthe first State senate, in 1861. The next year he was elected State\r\nsenator from Atchison county. In that year, and again in 1864, he was\r\nnominated for lieutenant-governor on the anti-Lane ticket. During the\r\nCivil war he served as judge advocate on the staff of Gen. George W.\r\nDeitzler with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1865 Mr. Ingalls\r\nmarried Miss Anna Louisa Chesebrough, a descendant of William\r\nChesebrough, who came to this country with Gov. Winthrop in 1630. Her\r\nfather, Ellsworth Chesebrough, was a New York importer who came to\r\nAtchison, Kan., in 1859, and at the time of his death, in 1860, was an\r\nelector on the Lincoln ticket. Of this union eleven children were born,\r\nsix of whom were living at the time of Mr. Ingalls’ death, viz:\r\nEllsworth, Ethel, Ralph, Sheffield, Marion and Muriel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _John J. Ingalls_\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1873, “Opportunity,” of which Mr. Ingalls wrote in his declining\r\nyears, knocked at his door. He was made a candidate for United States\r\nsenator at a private caucus one night and was elected by the legislature\r\nthe next day. His career at Washington, covering a period of eighteen\r\nyears, was one of great brilliancy. He quickly acquired distinction, and\r\nSpeaker Reed remarked before he had learned the name of the new senator:\r\n“Any man who can state a proposition as that senator does is a great\r\nman.” As a parliamentarian he was unsurpassed. Senator Harris, a\r\nDemocrat from Tennessee, said: “Mr. Ingalls will go down upon the\r\nrecords as the greatest presiding officer in the history of the senate.”\r\nHis speeches made him famous. He was the master of sarcasm and satire,\r\nas well as of eulogistic oratory. His address on John Brown, a speech of\r\nblistering satire; the one delivered in Atchison after his vindication\r\nin the senate; and his eulogies of Senator Hill and Senator Wilson are\r\nclassic masterpieces, seldom if ever excelled in oratory. Senator\r\nIngalls was a strict partisan, an invincible champion of any cause, and\r\na bitter and persevering opponent. During his three terms in the senate\r\nhis greatest efforts were in the advocacy of the constitutional rights\r\nof the freedom of the South and the rights of the veterans of the Civil\r\nwar. When a wave of Populism came over Kansas it found him practically\r\nunprepared. He had given little attention to the money question and the\r\ntariff, and it was these things which were clamoring for solution. He\r\nwas defeated by the Populists for senator in 1891. Mr. Ingalls said many\r\ntimes that he valued a seat in the senate above any other honor in the\r\ngift of the American people. As an author Mr. Ingalls won his reputation\r\nfirst by a number of articles appearing in the old _Kansas Magazine_,\r\namong which were “Cat-Fish Aristocracy” and “Blue Grass.” His poem,\r\n“Opportunity,” is worthy to be classed with the greatest in the English\r\nlanguage, and it may yet outlive his reputation as an orator and\r\nstatesman and be his lasting monument. After leaving the senate Mr.\r\nIngalls retired from active life, traveled for his health, and died in\r\nNew Mexico, August 16, 1900. In January, 1905, a statue of him was\r\ninstalled in Statuary Hall at Washington with fitting ceremonies, being\r\nthe first statue to be contributed by Kansas, although Mr. Ingalls\r\nduring his lifetime had urged upon the State to place one of John Brown\r\nin this hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SIDNEY MARTIN.\r\n\r\nA publication of this nature exercises its most important function when\r\nit takes cognizance of the life and labors of those citizens who\r\nattained prominence and prosperity through their own well directed\r\nefforts and who were of material value in furthering the advancement and\r\ndevelopment of the commonwealth. Sidney Martin came to Atchison county\r\nin 1856 when a boy of eleven. He endured the hardships common to the\r\nresident of Kansas previous to and during the Civil war period. He made\r\nseveral trips between Atchison and Denver as a freighter; drove over\r\nsome 400 miles of country infested with Indians and narrowly escaped\r\ndeath at their hands. He bought the first section of land that was sold\r\nin the Kickapoo reservation and became one of the most successful\r\nfarmers and stock breeders in northeastern Kansas. He was actively\r\nidentified with the development of this section of the State and\r\nattained prominence and influence as a citizen.\r\n\r\nSidney Martin was a native of Kentucky, born in Estill county on\r\nNovember 1, 1846, a son of Jackson H. and Polly (Walters) Martin. His\r\nancestors, paternal and maternal, were among the first to settle in the\r\nVirginia colony, coming from England in 1607. His father, Jackson H.\r\nMartin, best known to the residents of Atchison county as “Uncle Jack”\r\nMartin, was also a Kentuckian, born in Estill county on January 15,\r\n1812, a son of Robert and Mary (Harris) Martin, both of whom were\r\nnatives of Virginia. Robert Martin served in the War of 1812 and was a\r\ncommissioned officer. The epaulets from his uniform were in the\r\npossession of the family until a few years ago. Subsequent to this\r\nservice he removed to Kentucky and was one of Daniel Boone’s companions\r\nand was with him during many Indian fights. He was one of the pioneer\r\nsettlers of Estill county.\r\n\r\nJackson H. Martin, or “Uncle Jack,” as he was commonly called, was\r\nreared in Estill county, married there, and in 1855 brought his family\r\nto Buchanan county, Missouri, where he lived one year. In the spring of\r\n1856 he came to Kansas and settled at Mormon’s Grove. The place derived\r\nits name through being a former Mormon emigrant settlement. It was about\r\nfive miles from Atchison. “Uncle Jack” and his family occupied the\r\nMormon cabin until he could build one of his own. He preëmpted a quarter\r\nsection of land at this point and engaged in farming. A native of\r\nKentucky, a Democrat as well, he naturally became involved in the\r\nturmoil of events preceding the Civil war. For the protection of himself\r\nand family, he built a double wall of stone and earth around his\r\ndwelling. This caused it to be called Ft. Martin. The place was attacked\r\none night by Jayhawkers who were after horses. The attacking party were\r\ndriven off without booty and several of their number were wounded.\r\n“Uncle Jack” continued to reside at Ft. Martin until 1878, when he\r\nbecame a resident of Effingham. He built the Martin Hotel and conducted\r\nit for a number of years. He was a success as a host, his hotel was\r\nfamous for its cookery and hospitality and Effingham the gainer by his\r\ncoming. His death occurred in April, 1902, at the age of ninety years.\r\nHe had lived an eventful life, had watched Kansas grow from a sparsely\r\nsettled, faction-torn border State to one of the most prosperous\r\nagricultural commonwealths of the Union. He had met many of the most\r\nfamous men of her formative period, and was a personal friend of John A.\r\nMartin, Paddy Brown, Governor Glick and Charles Robinson. His wife,\r\nPolly Walters, whom he married in Estill Springs, Ky., died in April,\r\n1895. They were the parents of four children: Ann Elizabeth, the wife of\r\nWilliam Hight, of Fremont county, Colorado; Sidney, the subject of this\r\nreview; Mary W., widow of Gilbert Keithline, of Atchison county, and\r\nSally, widow of Henry Woodard. Twins died in infancy. Martha died at the\r\nage of sixteen years. Sally (Martin) Woodard was born in Estill county,\r\nKentucky, in 1852, and came with her parents to Kansas in 1856. She was\r\nreared on the old Martin farm in Atchison county, and in 1869 married\r\nHenry Woodard, who was born in Evansville, Ind., in 1844. He was a son\r\nof Philander Henry Woodard, who came to Atchison in the early sixties\r\nand engaged in the milling business. After his marriage Henry Woodard\r\nsettled on a farm in Jackson county, where he remained until 1874, when\r\nhe located in Effingham and engaged in the mercantile business. He\r\nfollowed this line of occupation until a few years before his death\r\nwhich occurred May 30, 1914. He is survived by his widow and the\r\nfollowing children: Philander Henry, Jack Martin, Gilbert Campbell,\r\nDorothy, wife of Elmer Percival, of Sheridan county, Kansas; Helen Lee,\r\nwife of Rolla Taliaferro; and Sally Bernice, a student in the Atchison\r\nBusiness College.\r\n\r\nSidney Martin acquired his education in the schools of Atchison, and\r\nlater completed a course in the Platte City (Missouri) Academy. He was\r\nreared on his father’s farm, near Atchison, and assisted in its carrying\r\non until about sixteen years of age. He then secured employment with Mr.\r\nTeuschau, a pioneer French trader and freighter, who had an Indian wife.\r\nHe was also with the Scotch freighter, Kisskadden, on several trips. The\r\nlatter recommended him as a capable guide and driver to G. T. Smith, who\r\nwished to secure the services of some one who could take his wife and\r\nbaby, and the aged wife of his partner, from Atchison to Denver in 1864,\r\nwhere Smith owned a hardware store. Although but sixteen years of age,\r\nyoung Martin secured the job. This was in 1864, a time when the Indians\r\nwere on the war path and Smith’s wagon with young Martin as driver,\r\nstarted alone, but joined a freighting outfit numbering some forty\r\nwagons and drivers. Just before they reached Ft. Kearney at Big Sandy,\r\nthey met fleeing Blue River ranchmen, who were hurrying to the nearest\r\nsettlement, and who told them the Indians were on the war path. They\r\nstayed all night at the home of a settler and heard the following day\r\nthat Indians had murdered the settler’s family and burned their house.\r\nThe wife of Smith’s partner was insistent on a proper observance of the\r\nSabbath day, and while in the Indian country caused Mrs. Smith to order\r\nthat their wagon remain in camp over Sunday. The wagon train left them\r\nbehind and the Lord’s day was properly kept by the women, although they\r\nwere warned by Martin that it was dangerous to leave the protection of\r\nthe train. As related by Martin “that was the longest day I ever spent.”\r\nAbout midnight he fed and harnessed the team and started on with the\r\nintention of joining the train of eleven men and wagons which had\r\npreceded them. At sunrise they reached a lone ranch and its owner, who\r\nwas postmaster, told Martin the wagons were just ahead, over the first\r\nhill. Here he mailed a letter to his mother. On arriving at the hill top\r\nMartin was able to see the valley where the train had camped. The wagons\r\nwere in flames, had been robbed of their contents, a large part of which\r\nwas whiskey. Two women were taken captives and the eleven freighters had\r\nbeen killed and scalped by Indians. The savages had indulged in the\r\ncaptured whiskey and were so thoroughly stupefied that they were\r\nincapable of riding a horse and also failed to follow the wagon which\r\nMartin drove. He wheeled his team and drove them at full speed to the\r\nnearest ranch and found the buildings burned. They drove on to the next\r\nranch where they secured protection, a company of soldiers arriving\r\nthere the same day. The officer in command was drunk and refused to\r\nattack the red-skins that night when victory would have been easy. When\r\nthe company reached the scene of the massacre the following day, the\r\nIndians were not to be seen. Martin’s next stop was at another ranch and\r\nhere Mr. Smith joined the wagon, having rushed forward in the belief\r\nthat Martin had been killed and the women captured by the savages. On\r\nparting from his charges Martin was given a plain band gold ring by Mrs.\r\nSmith with her blessing. He made several other trips across the plains,\r\nthe last one with his father, “Uncle Jack” Martin, which took them to\r\nMontana. When the Kickapoo Indian reservation was thrown open to\r\npurchase, Sidney Martin bought the first section that was sold and\r\nseveral years later he bought the last, becoming the owner of 560 acres\r\nin one body. He entered actively into the developing of his raw land and\r\nbrought it up to a highly productive state. He became widely and\r\nfavorably known as a breeder of Shorthorn cattle, and from time to time\r\npurchased additional acreage until his holdings in land were extensive,\r\nowning at one time 747 acres, at the time of his demise. He took an\r\nactive part in political affairs of his section, and, while disinclined\r\nto accept office, was called upon frequently for counsel and advice. He\r\nwas a man of keen perceptions, knew men and the motives which actuated\r\nthem, and was a student thoroughly familiar with the questions of the\r\nday. He numbered among his close personal friends, Governor Glick. His\r\ndeath occurred on January 3, 1904.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin married on February 20, 1868, Miss Mary Elizabeth White, a\r\ndaughter of George B., born May 10, 1815, and Mary Elizabeth (Lindsay)\r\nWhite, born December 14, 1820, the former a native of Woodford county,\r\nKentucky, and the latter of Carroll county. They were married January\r\n25, 1839. She died September 25, 1860, while the family was residing in\r\nMissouri. After the death of his wife, Mr. White came to Atchison and\r\nengaged in the grain business. With S. R. Washer he built the first\r\nelevator in the city of Atchison. He died in November, 1900. Mrs. Martin\r\nwas born on May 15, 1848, while her parents were living in Missouri. On\r\nthe maternal side she is descended from the Blackburn family, members of\r\nwhich fought with the Continental troops in the war for independence.\r\nAfter the death of her husband, Mrs. Martin became a resident of the\r\ncity of Atchison, where she has since resided.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ROBERT M. THOMAS.\r\n\r\nIn every community we find that there are some individuals who seem\r\nnaturally endowed with the ability to go ahead and do things and take a\r\nplace of leadership among their associates. Robert M. Thomas is one of\r\nthose who possess the natural endowments, peculiar to leadership and the\r\nability to make things go with which he is connected. A successful\r\nfarmer, a good citizen and business man, makes an excellent combination,\r\nand Mr. Thomas has made his mark in his community as a progressive and\r\nenterprising citizen.\r\n\r\nRobert M. Thomas was born in Buchanan county, Missouri, February 2,\r\n1868, a son of Moses and Katie (Critchfield) Thomas, who were born and\r\npartly reared in old Kentucky. The parents of both were early settlers\r\nof Buchanan county. Moses was the son of Robert Thomas, and the father\r\nof his wife was Martin Critchfield. They were Southern born, and were\r\ndescendants of old Southern families. Moses Thomas was born in 1843, and\r\nstill resides in Buchanan county; his wife, Katie, was born in 1850, and\r\nis still living. The Thomas family has a farm of 140 acres in Buchanan\r\ncounty, upon which was reared a large family of eleven children, nine of\r\nwhom are living: Robert M.; John, deceased; Walter, living in\r\nCalifornia; Forrest, residing in St. Joseph, Mo.; Harriet and Cecil, at\r\nhome; Ollie, deceased; Louise, Margaret, Cora and Ellen, at home with\r\ntheir parents.\r\n\r\nR. M. Thomas received his education in the public schools of his native\r\nState and assisted his father in the operating of the home farm until\r\n1892, when he married and farmed for three years in Buchanan county,\r\nMissouri, and then worked his farm in Platte county, Missouri, for four\r\nyears. His first purchase of land was in 1899 when he invested in a farm\r\nof 120 acres in Buchanan county, which he sold three years later at a\r\nprofit over the original purchase price. In 1902 he bought another farm,\r\nand in 1903 located two and one-half miles northwest of Effingham in\r\nBenton township. This farm comprises 160 acres and is now one of the\r\nbest improved places in the neighborhood. Mr. Thomas did so well in\r\nAtchison county that he was enabled to buy another farm of 160 acres in\r\n1912. This farm is located in Grasshopper township, about three miles\r\nnorth of Muscotah. Upon the organization of the Farmers’ Mercantile\r\nCompany in June, 1913, in which Mr. Thomas took an active part, he\r\nassumed the managership of the same and attends to his business during\r\nthe day, while still making his home at the farm. This plan gives him an\r\nexcellent opportunity to oversee his farming operations at all times.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas was married in 1892 to Katie Stanton, of Platte county,\r\nMissouri, a daughter of William and Cynthia (Hall) Stanton, natives of\r\nPlatte county, and of Eastern origin. To this union the following\r\nchildren have been born: William, married Pearl, daughter of Thomas O.\r\nGault, and is managing his father’s farm, two miles north of Muscotah;\r\nClara, a graduate of the Atchison County High School, and a teacher in\r\nthe public schools; Margaret, Ollie and Jessie, students in the county\r\nhigh school; Elva, Emma, Robert M., and Daisy, attending the district\r\nschool near their home.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas is a Democrat in politics and has filled the office of\r\ntrustee of Benton township one term. He and his family are members of\r\nthe Christian church. He is fraternally connected with the Odd Fellows\r\nlodge.\r\n\r\nThe Farmers’ Mercantile Association, of which Mr. Thomas is the manager,\r\nwas organized in June of 1913 for the purpose of handling grain, coal,\r\nfeed and seeds. The capital stock of the concern is $10,000, of which\r\n$6,800 is fully paid up. The officers of the association were:\r\nPresident, C. A. Taliaferro; vice-president, Stewart Hefflefinger;\r\nsecretary and manager, R. M. Thomas; treasurer, C. M. Snyder. The\r\ndirectors are: C. A. Taliaferro, S. Hefflefinger, Charles M. Snyder,\r\nJohn E. Sullivan, R. M. Thomas, E. H. Cawley, W. M. Sutter, R. B. Hawk,\r\nReuben Hargrove. The present officers are the same with the exception\r\nthat Reuben Hargrove is now serving as the vice-president, and Fred\r\nWyatt was elected to fill the vacancy in the board of directors, caused\r\nby the demise of C. A. Taliaferro and Edward High succeeded W. M.\r\nSutter. The concern has a grain elevator with a capacity of 8,000\r\nbushels. The largest shipment of grain made in any one year has exceeded\r\n115,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM McADAM.\r\n\r\nWilliam McAdam, retired farmer, of Effingham, Kan., was born February 6,\r\n1861, in Sterlingshire, Scotland, and is a son of James and Helen\r\n(Macnee) McAdam, who, with their children emigrated from their native\r\ncountry in 1882 and settled on a farm near Effingham in Atchison county,\r\nKansas. They reared a family of five children, of whom William is the\r\noldest, the others being as follows: Mrs. Jane Drummond, of Ellenville,\r\nKan.; George, of Holton, Kan.; Mrs. Nellie Drummond, residing in\r\nCottonwood Falls, Kan.; and James, living at Holton, Kan. The father of\r\nthese children was born in 1820, and died in 1885, just three years\r\nafter coming to America. He was a hard-working, industrious farmer. The\r\nmother was born in 1839 and departed this life in May, 1899.\r\n\r\nWilliam McAdam was twenty-one years of age when the family came to\r\nAtchison county and for three years after his arrival here he assisted\r\nhis parents in the operation of the home farm. He then worked out for\r\none year and began renting land on his own account, renting twelve years\r\nin all, five of which were in Jackson county, Kansas. His first purchase\r\nof land was a tract of ninety-six acres in Jackson county, which he\r\nimproved and resided upon until 1907, when he moved to Effingham, where\r\nhe and his family reside in one of the most attractive homes in the\r\ncity, located on a tract of ten acres. Mr. McAdam is now the owner of\r\n160 acres of good land south of Effingham, over which he has\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1888 to Miss Augusta Sutter, a daughter of Frederick\r\nSutter, now deceased, who was one of the earliest settlers in Atchison\r\ncounty, and who became one of the wealthy land owners of the county.\r\n(See sketch of Fred Sutter.) Two children have been born to Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMcAdam, Fannie and Mabel, both of whom are at home with their parents.\r\nThe mother of these children was born in Atchison county in 1861.\r\n\r\nMr. McAdam is an independent Democrat, who votes as his conscience\r\ndictates, and prefers to support the man rather than any one political\r\nparty or creed, believing in this manner that better government will\r\nresult. He is a member of the Presbyterian church, and is fraternally\r\nconnected with the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CLAUDIUS DEMONT WALKER.\r\n\r\nThe citizen who loves his city to the extent that he is willing to\r\ndevote his energies toward making it a better abiding place for his\r\nfellow men, and does his duty in a public capacity, regardless of\r\ncriticism or adverse comments, is a man worth while. He whose name heads\r\nthis review is such an individual. As mayor of Atchison, C. D. Walker\r\nmade a record which will outlive the present generation; as an attorney\r\nhe has achieved a signal success and ranks high in the legal fraternity\r\nof the State of Kansas; as a religious worker he has accomplished much\r\ngood of a lasting and enduring quality for the community in which he\r\nlives. Born of Kansas pioneer parents, his training and education were\r\nsuch as to prepare him for the career which has made him distinguished\r\namong his fellow men; and he has proven that a wholesome example set by\r\nnoble parents is the best incentive that a man can have to guide him\r\nthrough life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Eng. by E. G. Williams & Bro. N. Y._\r\n\r\n  _C. D. Walker_\r\n]\r\n\r\nC. D. Walker was born March 29, 1851, at Greenville, Pa., a son of\r\nHarvey and Anna M. Walker, the former a native of Pennsylvania and the\r\nlatter a native of Ireland. Harvey Walker, the father, was born in 1820\r\nand was a son of Harvey Walker, a native of the Keystone State, who\r\nmarried at Pittsburgh, Pa., Miss Mary Ann Carr, who was born at Mile\r\nEnd, England. The grandfather of C. D. Walker was a wagon and carriage\r\nmaker by trade and operated a shop in Greenville for many years. The\r\nhistory of the Walkers in America begins with three brothers who\r\nemigrated from the north of Ireland in colonial days. One of whom,\r\nSamuel Walker, located near Rochester, N.Y., one, Andrew Walker, settled\r\nin Virginia, and one, the great-grandfather of C. D. Walker, settled in\r\nPennsylvania. Being north Ireland people it is practically certain that\r\nthe Walker family is of Scotch descent, their ancestors having emigrated\r\nfrom the ancestral home of the family to the north of Ireland a few\r\ncenturies ago when the migration of the protestant people from the Isle\r\nof Britain to escape religious persecution occurred. Harvey Walker\r\nlearned his father’s trade of wagon and carriage making, but worked but\r\nlittle at the business. Imbued with the desire to better his fortunes in\r\nthe great West, he left the old home of the family in about 1854 and\r\nmigrated to Oneida, Ill., near which town he purchased a homestead.\r\nAfter farming for a few years he sold out and started overland to the\r\nnew State of Kansas, which at that time was attracting adventurers from\r\nall parts of the country. The family possessions were loaded upon wagons\r\ndrawn by horses, and in due time the Walkers arrived at Ft. Scott in\r\nBourbon county, Kansas, their destination. During the years ’57–’58–’59,\r\nthe senior Walker traded with the Indians, and eventually located on a\r\nhomestead, twelve miles northwest of Ft. Scott. Harvey Walker was a\r\nstanch Methodist of the uncompromising type and was unalterably opposed\r\nto the institution of slavery. He fearlessly and freely voiced his\r\nconvictions at every opportunity, and his outspoken tendencies\r\nfrequently brought trouble upon him from the slavery advocates, who had\r\nsettled in the neighborhood in considerable numbers. He was always\r\nintroducing new innovations in farming methods and machinery. It is a\r\nmatter of history that he owned and used the first rake harvester\r\nbrought to that part of the country. The slavery advocates and border\r\nruffians annoyed him considerably. They stole his horses, broke up his\r\nwagons and farming implements and so pronounced were the threats of the\r\nslavery men that Mr. Walker was forced to spend most of his time in Ft.\r\nScott away from his family. He was greatly interested in the success of\r\nthe anti-slavery propagandists and used great influence in determining\r\nthe ultimate destiny in Kansas becoming a free State. When the war broke\r\nout he decided to move north. In the spring of 1861 he arrived in the\r\ncity of Atchison, which at that time was a small village, and was\r\ninduced by Capt. Asa Barnes to locate in Atchison county, where he\r\nremained about a year. He afterwards purchased and settled on a tract of\r\nland adjoining the town of Winchester, Jefferson county, Kansas. Here he\r\nlocated his permanent Kansas home, and developed a fine farm. Here he\r\nraised a large family, and gave his children the best education the\r\nschool facilities at that time afforded. Harvey Walker was married\r\nDecember 24, 1848, to Anna Mariah Nelson, who bore him the following\r\nchildren, namely: Crandall C., an importer of thoroughbred horses, Sioux\r\nCity, Iowa; Claudius D., with whose career this review is directly\r\nconcerned; Marion D., a farmer and fruit grower, living near Midland\r\nCollege, Atchison county; Marvin L., a banker of Oklahoma City, Okla.;\r\nEllis Lytle, living in Washington State; Schuyler R., a farmer of\r\nStillwater Okla.; Harvey Mitchell, an importer of thoroughbred horses of\r\nOklahoma City; William Nelson, a farmer of Stillwater, Okla.; Roland\r\nFerris, who died in infancy; Orlina L., widow of William McKenney,\r\ndeceased, a hardware merchant of Winchester, Kan., and Anna M., wife of\r\nWilliam B. Stevenson, a Methodist minister. The mother of the foregoing\r\nchildren was born in north Ireland, September 24, 1824, a daughter of\r\nJames and Elizabeth (Farris) Nelson. James Nelson was agent for an\r\nEnglish estate in Ireland, and was the son of William Nelson and\r\nCatherine (Stewart) Nelson. His wife, Elizabeth Farris, was the daughter\r\nof Robert and Jane Farris, all of English descent. Anna Mariah Nelson\r\ncame to America when eight years old with a brother, and went to live\r\nwith an aunt in Greenville, Pa., while her family settled in Bayfield,\r\nCanada. She was educated in the schools at Greenville and afterwards\r\nbecame a teacher in the public school where she was wooed and married by\r\nHarvey Walker. Harvey Walker and his noble wife were sturdy God-fearing\r\nChristians, and the family prayers were a part of the regular regime of\r\nthe religious creed followed by them through life. They were ardent\r\nMethodists who believed in living faithfully according to the precepts\r\nof their religion, and the examples set by their upright and consistent\r\nconduct throughout their long lives left an indelible imprint upon the\r\nlives of their children, who have endeavored to follow in the footsteps\r\nof their parents. Claudius DeMont attended the district school at\r\nWinchester, and when eighteen years of age left home to enter Baker\r\nUniversity at Baldwin, Kan. After two years of hard work in Baker\r\nUniversity he entered the agricultural college at Manhattan, which at\r\nthat time was a college controlled by the Methodists and had the best\r\nfacilities of any college of the State of Kansas. Here he spent four\r\nyears and should have graduated in the class of 1873, but on account of\r\nill health was compelled to leave school before the end of the term. In\r\nthe fall of 1876 Mr. Walker matriculated in the law department of the\r\nUniversity of Michigan at Ann Arbor. During the year previous to this,\r\nhe had studied law in the office of Boyce & Boyd in Cincinnati, Ohio,\r\nand upon his matriculation at Ann Arbor entered the junior class of the\r\nuniversity. He graduated from the law department at Ann Arbor in the\r\nclass of 1878, and immediately located in Atchison, where he began the\r\npractice of his profession. From the very beginning his professional\r\ncareer was a success. In February, 1882, he formed a partnership with\r\nJudge Gilbert, which continued until Gilbert’s election to the district\r\nbench in the fall of 1887. Since that time Mr. Walker has practiced his\r\nprofession alone for thirty-four consecutive years, which has been\r\nfilled with gratifying success. The district records of Atchison county\r\nshow that for many years Mr. Walker was interested in virtually all of\r\nthe important cases pending. For many years he was attorney for the\r\nFirst National Bank of Atchison, Kan., together with many other large\r\ninstitutions of the city.\r\n\r\nDuring his long successful legal career, Mr. Walker has not neglected\r\nthe material side of his affairs and early invested his money in loans\r\nand real estate. His investments were so judiciously made that he has\r\nbecome one of the largest land owners of Kansas, and is rated as one of\r\nAtchison’s wealthiest citizens. His total holdings in Atchison county\r\nwill exceed 1,700 acres of farm lands, and he also owns other lands in\r\nTexas and western Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe political and civic career of Mr. Walker has been a noteworthy one\r\nand portrays the rugged honesty and public spirited feeling which have\r\nactuated him during his whole life. He was first appointed to the office\r\nof county auditor by Judge Gilbert in 1888, and served for two years;\r\nand was elected to the office of county attorney in 1891, and served in\r\nthis capacity until 1894. His service as county attorney included the\r\nmost strenuous years of his life, inasmuch as the court docket was\r\ncontinually crowded during his entire incumbency. This was the time that\r\nCoxey’s army of unemployed was making its journey from this part of the\r\ncountry toward Washington and on its way committed all kinds of small\r\ncrimes, and many arrests were made daily. It was Mr. Walker’s duty to\r\nprosecute these numberless cases as they came up for trial which\r\noverwhelmed him. He has served as a member of the city council of\r\nAtchison several terms, and was mayor for two years, 1911 to 1913. Mr.\r\nWalker’s administration of the city’s affairs during his incumbency as\r\nthe chief executive is considered to have been the best that Atchison\r\never had in a constructive and law-abiding sense. Several miles of\r\nstreet paving was accomplished and many bad streets were repaved\r\nthoroughly and well. The first concrete paving in the city was laid on\r\nDivision street and done in the best manner possible. The city purchased\r\nthe finest fire apparatus ever brought to a northeast Kansas city. The\r\nWest Atchison fire station was built. Three large sewer districts were\r\ncreated and the sewers installed. One of these was the intercepting\r\nsewer in White Clay creek. For many years the city of Atchison suffered\r\nfrom the filth and stench of White Clay creek until the same became\r\nintolerable. The remedy had been thought impossible, but on Mr. Walker’s\r\nelection he conceived the plan of installing an intercepting sewer which\r\nhas proved a great success, and a benefit to the city.\r\n\r\nThe electric light rate was reduced from 15 to 10 cents per kilowatt,\r\nthus saving to the consumer thousands of dollars annually. The street\r\nlighting was changed from the half night to the all night moon light\r\nschedule, with many new lights added and without a dollar’s increase in\r\nexpenses. The city was freed from joints and gambling places and houses\r\nof ill repute within the first few months after Mr. Walker went into\r\noffice and remained so during his entire term. As mayor he first raised\r\nthe question of requiring the mills and other large institutions located\r\nalong railroads, and the railroads entering the city to light their own\r\npremises and yards.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker was the promoter and organizer of the first independent\r\ntelephone company in the city, which company succeeded in putting the\r\nBell Telephone Company out of business for the time being, and until the\r\nHome company was sold to the Bell company in 1911, and a consolidation\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker is a Republican and has always taken a more or less active\r\npart in his party’s affairs. He was at one time a candidate for Congress\r\nfrom the First Congressional district of the State of Kansas, at the\r\ntime the three-cornered fight for the nomination between Ex-Governor\r\nBailey, Charles Curtis and C. D. Walker was waged, and a deadlock ensued\r\nwhich lasted for more than one week.\r\n\r\nHis family life has been an ideal one, and in keeping with the career of\r\nthe man himself. The marriage of Mr. Walker and Miss Lizzie E. Auld took\r\nplace June 7, 1881, at Atchison, Kan. One daughter has blessed this\r\nunion, Isabelle, wife of Louis D. Brockett, a son of B. L. Brockett, a\r\nleading lumber merchant of Atchison. Mr. Brockett has charge of the loan\r\nbusiness established by Mr. Walker. Mrs. Lizzie Auld Walker was born in\r\nBrownsville, Pa., a daughter of William W. and Isabelle Mullen Auld,\r\nnatives of Pennsylvania, of Scotch-Irish ancestry. The Auld family is\r\none of the oldest of American families. Its members are related closely\r\nwith the Carrolls of Carrollton, Va., whose ancestors came from north of\r\nIreland and were originally of Scotch ancestry. William W. Auld migrated\r\nfrom Pennsylvania to Atchison, Kan., in, 1872, and was a member of the\r\nmilling firm of Blair & Auld, from that time until his death in 1895.\r\nMr. Walker has been a member of the Masonic fraternity for over thirty\r\nyears, and has taken a regular course of Masonry, being a Knight\r\nTemplar. He is fraternally affiliated with the Benevolent and Protective\r\nOrder of Elks, the Knights of Pythias, the Modern Woodmen, Knights and\r\nLadies of Security, the Ancient Order of United Workmen, and the Royal\r\nArcanum. It is only natural that a man reared in a religious atmosphere,\r\nas he has been, should take an active and influential part in church and\r\nreligious work. Mr. Walker has been a member of the official board of\r\nthe First Methodist Episcopal Church of Atchison, since 1880, and has\r\nbeen a liberal and cheerful supporter of this denomination. At present\r\nhe is chairman of the building committee which has charge of the\r\nerection of the new building planned by the church for the ensuing year.\r\nSince 1889 he has served as a member of the board of trustees of Baker\r\nUniversity, of Baldwin, Kan. In 1908 he was a delegate to the National\r\nconference of the Methodist denomination at Baltimore. Successful as a\r\nlawyer, having achieved substantial competence in his behalf, made\r\nhistory as a public official, followed the teachings of his Christian\r\nparents as regards an upright life and doing his duty in a religious\r\nsense, sums up the life career of this useful Atchison citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ALVA CURTIS TRUEBLOOD.\r\n\r\nAlva Curtis Trueblood, a former Atchison merchant and city official and\r\nUnion veteran, now deceased, was born in Salem, Washington county,\r\nIndiana, in 1838, a son of Dr. Joshua and Zelpha (Arnold) Trueblood,\r\nnatives of South Carolina, who emigrated from their native State to\r\nIndiana in the early pioneer days when the Indians were still camping on\r\nthe streams and roaming the forests of the Hoosier State. The parents of\r\nA. C. Trueblood settled in Salem and he was there reared to manhood,\r\nreceiving his education in the district schools and the Seminary at\r\nBattle Creek, Mich., where he was graduated. After his graduation in the\r\nclassical course at Battle Creek, he returned to his home town of Salem\r\nand embarked in the newspaper business, purchasing the _Salem Times_,\r\nwhich he edited until the outbreak of the Civil war. He enlisted at the\r\nfirst call for troops issued by President Lincoln and was mustered in as\r\na member of Company H, Thirteen regiment, Indiana infantry, under\r\nCaptain Sales, who was later promoted to the rank of colonel, private\r\nTrueblood being successively promoted to a second lieutenancy and then\r\nto first lieutenant of his company. Later, he was commissioned a captain\r\nand remained Captain Trueblood until the close of the war. He saw much\r\nactive service during the great rebellion and was under fire with his\r\nregiment at the very first battle in which it was engaged, at Green\r\nBrier Mountain, W. Va. Captain Trueblood fought in thirty-six terrific\r\nbattles during his term of service, and was engaged in the nine days’\r\nbattle at Cold Harbor under General Grant. Captain Trueblood often gave\r\na vivid and heart-rending description of the terrific slaughter of human\r\nlives which took place at this great battle, and told of how a person\r\ncould walk for miles on the dead bodies with which the field was strewn.\r\nHis time of enlistment expired while the battle of Cold Harbor was in\r\nprogress, and he then returned to his home, where he was married\r\nDecember 29, 1864, to Hattie Allen.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Trueblood resided in Salem, Ind., until after the close of\r\nthe war when he entered the mercantile business in Salem and was very\r\nsuccessful. His health failing him it was deemed advisable that they\r\nseek a new home in the West. During his business career he had invested\r\nin Atchison county land, and they came to this county in 1880, settling\r\non their farm in the spring of that year. They remained on the farm but\r\na short time, however, until Mr. Trueblood regained his health, in a\r\nmeasure, and then removed to Atchison, where he embarked in the\r\nqueensware business, which he conducted for about three years. He was\r\nthen elected city clerk and held this office for about ten years.\r\nCaptain Trueblood died April 16, 1904. Mr. and Mr. Trueblood have reared\r\nthe following children: Albert, now engaged in the newspaper business at\r\nSacramento, Cal.; Victor T., manager of the Van Nuys News Company, of\r\nKansas City, Mo.; Paul T., a traveling salesman, residing in Grand\r\nIsland, Neb.; Owen T., of Kansas City, an express messenger of the\r\nMissouri Pacific railroad; Nellie, a graduate of Midland College, and a\r\nteacher in the Ingalls school; Norvel died in 1867, at the age of four\r\nyears. The mother of these children was born in March, 1840, a daughter\r\nof Thomas and Annis (Brinkley) Allen, both natives of West Virginia, and\r\npioneer settlers of Washington county, Indiana. She was educated in the\r\ncommon schools of her native county and attended the Salem Female\r\nCollege. Thomas Allen, father of Mrs. Trueblood, was proprietor of a\r\ncotton and woolen manufactory at Salem, and was forced to pay Gen. John\r\nMorgan and his raiders the sum of $1,000 to prevent the burning of his\r\nmill, when Morgan and his troops made their memorable raid and burned\r\nthe depot at Salem and raided the stores. Thomas Allen and wife were the\r\nparents of eight children, six sons and two daughters. Three of the sons\r\nwere Union soldiers, William Allen, the twin brother of Mrs. Trueblood,\r\nserving in the same regiment with Captain Trueblood.\r\n\r\nMr. Trueblood was an efficient and capable city official during his many\r\nyears of service in the city clerk’s office and had many warm friends in\r\nAtchison. He was allied with the Republican party and was prominent in\r\nthe affairs of his party. He was well known in Masonic circles and was\r\nhigh in the councils of the Masonic lodge, being master of Washington\r\nLodge, No. 5., of Atchison, Kan., for several years, and was a leading\r\nmember of the Grand Army of the Republic, both of which bodies\r\nofficiated at the ceremonies held when his body was laid away for the\r\nlong rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM J. CLEM.\r\n\r\nWilliam J. Clem, deceased farmer and horticulturist, of Shannon\r\ntownship, was born June 9, 1851, in Randolph county, Virginia, a son of\r\nAaron Clem, who immigrated to Kansas in 1863 and settled on Independence\r\ncreek, near the Doniphan-Atchison county line. On the farm, which his\r\nfather owned in this pioneer settlement of Kansas, William was reared to\r\nyoung manhood, and married, after which he lived on a farm in the\r\nsouthern part of Doniphan county for four years, then moved to the Myers\r\nfarm, which he and his wife purchased some years later and cultivated\r\nuntil March of 1898. In this year he purchased the fine farm which is\r\nnow owned by his widow and immediately began improving it. This farm\r\nconsists of sixty acres and lays within a few miles of Atchison in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction. Its acreage is divided as follows: Twenty acres\r\nof apples and small fruits, and forty acres of farm land and pasture.\r\nRealizing that it was necessary to follow intensive farming on a sixty-\r\nacre farm, Mr. Clem set out an orchard of 350 trees, which have been\r\nbearing prolifically for several years. An attractive farm residence,\r\nset in a fine lawn in which shrubbery and flower beds please the eye,\r\ntogether with a good barn and silo, greets the eye as they stand out on\r\na rise of land. Mr. Clem was a very industrious farmer, a good citizen,\r\nand a kind father and husband, and will long be remembered by those who\r\nknew him best and were aware of his many excellent qualities. He\r\ndeparted this life on May 26, 1906. He was a member of the Baptist\r\nchurch and a Democrat in politics.\r\n\r\nW. J. Clem, and Laura E. Myers, his widow, were married June 16, 1879,\r\nand to this union were born children, as follows: Mrs. Effie Randolph,\r\nof Atchison, who is the mother of two children, Elizabeth and Bernice;\r\nMrs. Clara Waltz, of Shannon township, and mother of one child, Virginia\r\nFrances; Mrs. Addie Underwood, residing on a farm in Shannon township,\r\nwho has one child, Spencer Eugene; Mrs. Laura Demmel, living near\r\nRushville, Mo., and mother of one son, Raymond; Albert, married Ella\r\nTurner, and Edgar, at home; Mrs. Lissa Marie Altauf, of south Tenth\r\nstreet, Atchison; Frances and Jessie, at home. Mrs. Laura E. (Myers)\r\nClem was born June 9, 1859, in Buchanan county, Missouri, a daughter of\r\nAugustus and Hulda (Snyder) Myers, natives of Germany and Indiana,\r\nrespectively. Augustus Myers was born in 1825 and died October 6, 1909.\r\nHis parents with their family immigrated to this country from Germany in\r\n1831. Augustus was reared on a farm, south of St. Joseph, and was there\r\nmarried. His wife, Hulda, was born in 1831 and died October 8, 1907. She\r\ncame with her parents to Buchanan county, Missouri, in 1841. There were\r\nnine children in the Myers family, namely: Hiram K., deceased; Edward\r\nS., deceased; William H., living in Doniphan county; Mrs. Laura E. Clem,\r\nwith whom this review is directly concerned; Winslow, of Gower, Mo.;\r\nCharles W. of Lancaster township, this county; Mrs. Dora Augusta Saeger,\r\nof Quincy, Ill.; Mrs. Malinda Frances Underwood, of Shannon township;\r\nand Ray Evans, of Seattle, Wash. The Myers family came to Atchison\r\ncounty in August of 1875, living in Atchison until February, 1876, and\r\nsettled on a farm in Shannon township, which he purchased from Andrew\r\nEvans, living on their place near Good Intent, until March of 1891, when\r\nthe old couple sold their farm to Mr. and Mrs. Clem, and retired to a\r\nhome in Atchison, where they died. Augustus Myers was a soldier in the\r\nUnion army and served for a few months under Captain Snyder, an uncle of\r\nMrs. Clem.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clem and her children are all members of the Christian church and\r\ntake an active part in the social and religious affairs carried on by\r\nthe large membership of this flourishing denomination. She and her\r\nsturdy sons carry on the farming operations in a creditable and\r\nprofitable manner and are happy and contented. The boys are greatly\r\ninterested in athletics and were an important part of the winning church\r\nbaseball team during the season of 1915. A happier nor more contented\r\nfamily can not be found in Atchison county. Mrs. Clem is a capable and\r\nintelligent woman who did not hesitate to take over the management of\r\nthe farm upon her husband’s demise and has made a success of the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JARED COPELAND FOX.\r\n\r\nThe late Jared Copeland Fox was one of Atchison’s ablest citizens,\r\npublic spirited, a successful financier and a familiar figure in the\r\nleading circles of the city for many years. Merchant, banker, scholar, a\r\nkind husband and father, his demise left a void which can never be\r\nfilled. Coming of a distinguished family, born October 30, 1841, in\r\nChili, N. Y., his life bears out the oft repeated assertion that lineage\r\nand birth have something to do with shaping a man’s destiny, and\r\ninfluencing his career. His parents were Jared Ware and Mercy Chapman\r\n(Copeland) Fox. Jared Ware Fox was a son of Alanson and Elizabeth (Ware)\r\nFox. His maternal grandfather was Jonathan Copeland, who married a Miss\r\nWells at Charlton, Mass., who was a direct descendant of Ruth, a\r\ndaughter of John and Priscilla Alden. On April 2, 1816, Jonathan\r\nCopeland was commissioned a captain in the militia and adjutant on the\r\ngovernor’s staff of Massachusetts in 1816. In 1819 he was appointed a\r\nbrigadier commander of the State militia. After his marriage he removed\r\nto New York and was there a colonel in the State militia of New York. He\r\nheld five different commissions in Massachusetts and New York. The Fox\r\nfamily is of English descent and originally settled in Connecticut. The\r\nmaiden name of the wife of Col. Jonathan Copeland was Rebecca Edwards\r\nand she was a connection of the family of which Rev. Jonathan Edwards\r\nwas a member. Colonel Copeland had three children: Mercy, Elizabeth and\r\nthe Rev. Jonathan Copeland, a Congregational minister of New York, who\r\nconducted an academy in that city and one of whose pupils was Philip\r\nArmour of beef packing fame. Jonathan was born October 16, 1786, died in\r\n1858 in New York; Rebecca was born in 1790, died February 6, 1863, in\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Eng. by E. G. Williams & Bro. N. Y._\r\n\r\n  _A. C. Fox_\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlanson Fox, grandfather of Jared C., removed from Connecticut to a farm\r\nnear Sherburne, N. Y., and here Jared Ware was born December 5, 1810.\r\nRev. Jared Ware Fox was educated for the ministry, studying four years\r\nin Oneida Institute and one year in a seminary in New York City, and for\r\nfifty years preached the Gospel according to the Congregational faith.\r\nIn the early days he was sent to Kansas by his church to establish and\r\norganize churches in the new towns and cities building up on the broad\r\nprairies. He formed a church at Burlingame and Ridgeway, Kan., making\r\nhis home at the latter place and preaching throughout the country\r\nserving churches at Kunwaka, Waveland, Valley Brook and one year at\r\nLawrence. He spent one year in Topeka in charge of a church in the\r\ncapital city. He was a strong abolitionist and was in his natural\r\nelement when he first came to Kansas in 1860, the year of the “great\r\ndrought.” He took an active part in the relief work in Kansas at that\r\ntime and sent his son, Jared C., then but eighteen years of age, back to\r\nGalesburg, Ill., where an old friend of the family resided, to gather\r\npotatoes and produce for the sustenance of the drought suffers. He died\r\nMarch 2, 1898, leaving the following children: Charles G., on the old\r\nhomestead at Ridgeway, Kan.; Jared C.; Irving Dwight, deceased; Herbert\r\nEverett, of California; Herman Elliot, Davenport, Iowa. The mother of\r\nthese children, Mercy C. (Copeland) Fox, was born February 16, 1816, and\r\ndied April 11, 1893.\r\n\r\nJared C. Fox received an academic education in New York and accompanied\r\nhis parents to Kansas. At the age of nineteen years he was first\r\nemployed in a general store conducted by Crosby Brothers at Valley\r\nFalls, Kan., at a salary of $150 per year and his board. He yearned for\r\na larger field and came to Atchison in 1862, entering the employ of\r\nWilliam Smith, who owned a dry goods store. During a part of the Civil\r\nwar he served as clerk in the commissary department at Rolla, Mo., under\r\nMajor Grimes for two years. After the close of the war he was deputy\r\ncounty treasurer under Sam C. King, and upon Mr. King’s resignation from\r\nthe county treasurership, he was appointed to serve for six months\r\nfinishing out Mr. King’s unexpired term. He then served as deputy United\r\nStates marshal under Charles Whiting. For some years previous to\r\nembarking in the drug business he was associated in the real estate\r\nbusiness with H. Clay Park, former postmaster of Atchison and editor of\r\n_The Patriot_, and now one of the editors of the _St. Joseph News_. In\r\n1869 Mr. Fox made the business venture which was the turning point of\r\nhis fortunes and launched him on the high road to financial success. He\r\nentered into partnership with W. C. McPike, S. C. King and Frank Allen\r\nin the wholesale drug business. Later Mr. Fox and Mr. McPike became the\r\nsole owners of the business, Mr. Fox disposing of his interest to T. M.\r\nWalker and the firm removed to Kansas City, where it is still doing\r\nbusiness under the name of the McPike Drug Co. Mr. Fox became interested\r\nin banking and at the time of his death was vice-president of the\r\nAtchison Savings Bank, the oldest State bank in Kansas. He conducted a\r\nloan business as his financial resources increased in strength and he\r\nbecame one of Atchison’s wealthy citizens.\r\n\r\nOn December 22, 1868, Mr. Fox was married to a charming southern lady,\r\nMiss Virginia Alexina Tortat. This union was blessed by the birth of\r\nfive children as follows: Jared Copeland, Jr., manager of the Howard\r\nManufacturing Co., of Atchison, and father of eight children, Virginia\r\nParker, Marjorie Parker, Jared Copeland, Jr., Parker, Amelia Joanna,\r\nLawton, Edith and William Horan; Edith Fox Jackson, wife of Judge W. A.\r\nJackson, and mother of two children, Jared Fox and Edmund Valentine;\r\nHenry Irving, wholesale druggist at Wichita, Kan., and father of Everett\r\nCranson, Florence, Mary Anne and Sarah Virginia Fox; William Tortat,\r\nassistant cashier in the Atchison Savings Bank, and father of one\r\ndaughter, Mary; Florence, at home with her mother. The mother of these\r\nchildren, Mrs. Virginia Fox, was born at Eufaula, Ala., December 20,\r\n1847, a daughter of Henri Sylvest and Nancy (Decker) Tortat. Henri S.\r\nTortat was born in October, 1811, in France. He was destined to be a\r\nclergyman by his parents, but, having no intention to enter the\r\npriesthood, took part in the three days’ revolution against Charles X.\r\nHe left home and joined an uncle who was an officer in the French army\r\nof occupation in Algiers in 1833. He came to America in 1836 when a\r\nyoung man and was married at Wiscassett, Me., to Nancy Decker, whom he\r\nmet at Boston, Mass. After his marriage he took his bride to Charleston,\r\nS. C., and thence to Eufaula, Ala., and conducted a merchandise store\r\nthere until he was induced to join a colony of southern people who were\r\ngoing to Kansas in May, 1857. When he came to Kansas he first took up a\r\nhomestead claim and then purchased a bakery at Tecumseh, Shawnee county,\r\nbut died July 6, 1858, before he could get fairly settled in the new\r\ncountry. Seven children were born to and reared by Henri and Nancy\r\nTortat: Henri Alexis, deceased; Mrs. Amelia Caroline Barry, deceased;\r\nMrs. J. C. Fox; Jean Paul, deceased; Augusta makes her home with Mrs.\r\nFox; William Marshall, Peabody, Mass.; Mary died at the home of Mrs.\r\nFox. Six years after Mr. Tortat’s demise, the mother and children\r\nremoved to Atchison, where she died December 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nIn his younger days Mr. Fox was a Republican, but later became a\r\nDemocrat and was a strong Cleveland adherent. He was a supporter of\r\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt during his first administration. He was a\r\nstaunch supporter of Woodrow Wilson when Wilson was a candidate for the\r\nPresidency, but was generally broad minded in his political views. He\r\nwas a member of Washington lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons,\r\nKnights Templar, a Mystic Shriner and an Odd Fellow; he was reared in\r\nthe Congregational church atmosphere but after marriage chose to attend\r\nthe Episcopalian church with his wife. His death occurred August 23,\r\n1914, when a strong and noble character passed to the great beyond. Mr.\r\nFox was blessed with a singularly happy temperament which manifested\r\nitself even on his bed of illness; he was always good humored and had a\r\nstrong sense of humor which, combined with a kindly disposition, made\r\nhim a prime favorite with his friends and acquaintances. He was a great\r\nreader, an expert accountant, possessed a strong memory and was a\r\nShakespearean scholar, quoting from Shakespeare while lying on his couch\r\nawaiting the last summons, and also quoting the Twenty-first Psalm on\r\nhis last day on earth. He served the city as a member of the city\r\ncouncil and was president of the school board for a term, being of\r\nmaterial assistance in handling their financial affairs, because of his\r\ngenius in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        JAMES EMERY PENNINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe _Western Advocate_, Mankato, Kan., in an issue of July, 1899, has\r\nthis to say in part regarding one of the most remarkable family reunions\r\never held in Kansas or anywhere in the country: “Without doubt the most\r\nremarkable family reunion ever held in Jewell county has been for the\r\npast week at Burr Oak and among the various members of the family in\r\nthat vicinity. It is the reunion of the eleven children, together with\r\nmany of the sixty-four grand children of the late James Pennington and\r\nSusan Wisdom Pennington. The Pennington family is a Southern family, the\r\nelder Pennington being a native of Tennessee, and his wife of North\r\nCarolina. All of the eleven children, however, with the exception of the\r\noldest son, were born and raised in Missouri. The Pennington family is\r\nremarkable in that there were just eleven children and they are all\r\nliving and enjoying good health, although the youngest is now fifty\r\nyears of age, the eldest being a little past seventy. These family\r\nreunions, which are an annual event, prove that the family tree,\r\nnourished by the good old warm Southern blood, is still bearing the\r\nfruits of hospitality and good cheer. Once a year they get together,\r\nparents, children and grand children, and the ties of family, of\r\nkinship, and affection are drawn a little closer. Hearts are cheered,\r\nlives are brightened and days are lengthened.” Speaking of the gathering\r\non Saturday of the reunion week, the _Western Advocate_ goes on to say:\r\n“On this day a company of one hundred gathered around the banquet board,\r\nand the eleven brothers and sisters were weighed and their combined\r\nweight found to be 1,832 pounds, an average of 166 pounds each.”\r\n\r\nThe father of this remarkable family was James Pennington, a native of\r\nTennessee, born in that State in 1822, and was there married to Susan\r\nWisdom. They migrated to Missouri in the early thirties and settled in\r\nNodaway county, developing a fine farm until the discovery of gold in\r\nCalifornia. James then set out across the plains and mountains to the\r\ngold fields of the New Eldorado in quest of fortune. While in California\r\nhe became a freighter and transported flour and provisions to the mining\r\ncamps afoot. He would carry a fifty pound sack of flour a distance of\r\nsixteen miles and was paid at the rate of $50 per sack for\r\ntransportation, the flour costing $50 per sack at the point of purchase\r\nand being valued at $100 when it was taken to its destination by the\r\ncarrier. James, Sr., remained in California until 1851 and then returned\r\nto his home and family in Missouri, where he lived the remainder of his\r\ndays, dying in 1878, in Platte county. James and Susan Pennington were\r\nthe parents of eleven children as follows: William W., born in 1837,\r\ndied February, 1913, at Lebanon, Kan.; John Thomas, California, born in\r\n1839; Mrs. Telitha Thorp, Marysville, Mo., born in 1841; Mrs. Julia\r\nDenney, Benedict, Kan., born in 1842; Mrs. Clementine Conner, Santa Ana,\r\nCal., born in 1844, a widow; Mrs. Nancy Miller, California, born in\r\n1845, a widow; James Emery, with whom this review is directly concerned;\r\nMrs. Sarah Robertson, Elk City, Okla., born in 1849; Mrs. Mary\r\nRobertson, Burr Oak. Kan., born in 1853; Mrs. Cynthia Jane Judy, Burr\r\nOak, born in 1855; Mrs. Rocksinah Graves, Burr Oak, Kan., born in 1857.\r\n\r\nJames Emery Pennington, retired farmer of Potter, Kan., was born on a\r\nfarm in Nodaway county, Missouri, October 30, 1847. He was reared on the\r\nfarm in Missouri until seventeen years of age, and he then left home and\r\ncrossed the plains. The occasion of his going was because of the fact\r\nthat two brothers and three brothers-in-law had already enlisted in the\r\nUnion army for service in the Civil war, and the father felt that he\r\ncould not spare his son, James E., so it was agreed between father and\r\nson that the boy should go west for a time. He made his way across the\r\nMissouri to Ft. Leavenworth and there joined an overland freight train\r\nwhich was bound for Salt Lake City, Utah. At that time all the freight\r\nand merchandise west of the Missouri river was transported in wagons,\r\ndrawn by horses, mules or oxen. These wagons were loaded with from six\r\nto twelve thousand pounds of merchandise and were drawn by teams ranging\r\nin numbers from twelve to twenty-four animals. From twenty to forty men,\r\nwagons and teams constituted what was then known as a “freight train.”\r\nThe train to which young Pennington attached himself consisted of forty\r\nwagons, forty teamsters, two wagon masters, four assistants, two night\r\nherders, and two extras, in all, fifty men, four hundred and ninety oxen\r\nand a few horses for herding purposes. Being a farmer boy and having a\r\nworking knowledge of animals, young Pennington soon made himself\r\nindispensable to the outfit and received the name of “Our Boy” from the\r\nother men in charge of the train. The train proceeded its long way over\r\nthe plains of Kansas and followed the valley of the South Platte to the\r\nRockies without mishap, other than a few Indian skirmishes. In October\r\nof 1864, “Our Boy” stood on the crest of the Rockies with one foot on\r\nthe Atlantic and one foot on the Pacific slope. Winter soon came on and\r\nstock perished and they arrived at their destination in the dead of\r\nsevere winter. Young Pennington spent the winter in the home of a Mormon\r\nfamily, consisting of a Mormon and his seven wives. From Utah he went\r\nnorth into Idaho and Montana, and in that region took up his favorite\r\npursuit of freighting, which he followed for four years. His operations\r\nwere mainly from Ft. Benton, the head of navigation on the Missouri\r\nriver, to which point the river steamers carried the freight destined\r\nfor the mining camps of the mountain regions. He, with others,\r\ntransported the first quartz mill to the mining camp, later widely known\r\nas Butte City, Mont. He returned home in 1869 and lived there for three\r\nyears, coming to Kansas in 1872. He had saved some capital which he\r\nbrought with him to Atchison county, and invested this money in a herd\r\nof cattle which he grazed upon the free ranges, in this manner getting\r\nhis first real start in life, and which was the beginning of his later\r\nprosperity. After his marriage in 1872 to Elizabeth Snoddy, he and his\r\nwife settled on the home farm of the Snoddy’s, and at the end of one\r\nyear the father of Mrs. Pennington deeded the young couple eighty acres\r\nof land which became the nucleus of their present acreage. This land is\r\nfour miles east and one-half mile south of Potter. Leavenworth county,\r\nand the farm has been increased to 320 acres of well improved land. Mr.\r\nPennington removed to Potter in the spring of 1916, from the farm in\r\nLeavenworth county, and has recently completed a fine, modern, ten-room\r\nresidence which will serve as his future domicile during the remainder\r\nof his days.\r\n\r\nJames E. Pennington was married February 1, 1872, to Elizabeth, daughter\r\nof Thomas and Margaret (Brown) Snoddy, the former a native of Tennessee,\r\nand the latter a native of Missouri. Thomas Snoddy first came to Kansas\r\nin 1854, and preëmpted the farm which he improved and where his children\r\nwere reared. He was a Mexican war veteran and the Government gave him\r\nfor his services a grant of land in northwestern Missouri, which he sold\r\nfor $1,600, and with the proceeds of the sale built his home on his\r\npreëmption in Kansas. The upper part of the house was used as\r\nheadquarters for the Kickapoo Masonic lodge for many years. Thomas\r\nSnoddy was born August 27, 1825, and died October 8, 1909. His remains\r\nwere interred in the Round Prairie cemetery. A remarkable fact about the\r\nSnoddy house is, that the roof existed without repairs for over fifty-\r\nfive years and at the time of its repair by Mr. Pennington, the\r\nexcellence of the material which went into the building of the house\r\nexcited newspaper comment. Mrs. Pennington was born on September 25,\r\n1856, and lived her whole life on the farm which her father preëmpted.\r\n\r\nThe following children were born to Mr. and Mrs. James Emery Pennington:\r\nRebecca, wife of William Ehart, of Atchison county, Kansas; Bessena,\r\nwife of Joseph James, of Atchison county, a farmer and horse and mule\r\ndealer; Roxie, wife of John Goff, of Potter, Kan., a thresher and\r\nfarmer; Thomas W., living on the home farm; Frank P., a lumber merchant,\r\nof Burr Oak, Kan., who was associated with his father in the grain\r\nbusiness in Potter, in 1906; George, a farmer living in Leavenworth\r\ncounty; Mamie, a student in the Potter High School.\r\n\r\nMr. Pennington, with others in his neighborhood, organized and placed in\r\noperation the Farmers’ Elevator Company, of which he was president. This\r\nconcern built the Potter grain elevator and later sold it to H. A. Ode.\r\nHe has long been identified with the Democratic party, but has never\r\nsought political preferment of any kind. At the time of the organization\r\nof the Potter High School district, Mr. Pennington was one of the prime\r\nmovers in the building of the new high school building. Perhaps the best\r\nknown trait of this grand old pioneer is his inherent hospitality, which\r\nhas made him famous and one of the best loved men in his section of the\r\nState. Concerning a great Christmas celebration held at the Pennington\r\nhome in 1911, the _Atchison Globe_, of December 27, 1911, says:\r\n\r\n“J. E. Pennington, a well known farmer of the Round Prairie\r\nneighborhood, south of town, always provides a big entertainment for his\r\nimmediate friends and relatives every Christmas, and spares no pains or\r\nexpense to make these annual affairs highly enjoyable. The late holiday\r\nwas no exception to the rule. On Monday quite a crowd gathered at Mr.\r\nPennington’s home, as usual, and spent a day of merriment. A big\r\nChristmas tree loaded with almost everything conceivable in the way of\r\nholiday gifts, was provided by Mr. Pennington; a big dinner was also\r\nserved, and in the afternoon the men indulged in a hunt. A long wire was\r\nstretched across a field, with a horse hitched to each end of it. The\r\nwire was thus dragged across the field and in this manner all of the\r\nrabbits were scared up. The men followed behind the wire and shot the\r\nrabbits as they jumped out. Four jack rabbits were scared up and one of\r\nthem killed; also many cottontails. It is said that Mr. Pennington\r\nexpended nearly $200 on this affair. He is a very prosperous farmer and\r\nis noted for his hospitality.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DR. EARL A. GILMORE.\r\n\r\nDr. Earl A. Gilmore, veterinary surgeon, of Effingham. Kan., was born\r\nSeptember 27, 1887, at Ames, Iowa, a son of William T. and Jerusha\r\n(Norton) Gilmore. His father was born in 1850, in New York State, and\r\nwhen an infant accompanied his father, George Gilmore, to Iowa. His\r\nmother was born at Zearing, Iowa, November 10, 1855, and died March 7,\r\n1898. William J. was reared on the pioneer farm in Iowa, and was able\r\nwhen a young man to take advantage of the opportunity to amass wealth in\r\nthe new and rich State, which was being developed during his day and\r\nlifetime. He was married September 5, 1869. He became one of Iowa’s most\r\nprosperous farmers, and in his later days, when he retired from active\r\nfarm work, he traveled extensively throughout the country, visiting many\r\npoints in the West, and the Philippine Islands. On February 1, 1915,\r\nwhile aboard a Missouri Pacific train en route to Kansas City, the train\r\nwas wrecked, and he was injured to such an extent that he was laid up in\r\nthe hospital at Kansas City for several weeks, and then returned to his\r\nhome at Ames, Iowa. There were ten children in the Gilmore family: Mrs.\r\nUretta Stevens, of Star City, Mich.; Mrs. Maria Pellersells, of Grand\r\nRapids, Wis.; Maines Gilmore, now in Alaska; Charles, of Greeley, Colo.;\r\nGeorge, living in Iowa; William, a college professor at Winnipeg,\r\nCanada; Earl A., the subject of this review; Mrs. Eva Burton, of Ames,\r\nIowa; Ella, deceased: one child died in infancy. The mother of these\r\nchildren was a daughter of Isaac Gilmore, a native of Ireland. The\r\nGilmore family is also of Irish descent, all four of Dr. Gilmore’s\r\ngrandparents having emigrated from the Emerald isle.\r\n\r\nEarl A. Gilmore was educated in the Nevada (Iowa) High School, and\r\nstudied at Drake University for one year; the Iowa State College at Ames\r\nfor two and one-half years; then studied for two years in the Kansas\r\nCity Veterinary College, graduating April 16, 1912. His funds being\r\nexhausted, when he decided to become a veterinary surgeon, he found it\r\nnecessary to work his way through his final college course, by doing\r\nreportorial work on the staff of the _Kansas City Star_. Upon his\r\ngraduation he immediately located in Effingham and has built up an\r\nextensive practice in his profession, covering a territory of twelve\r\nmiles, north and south, and nine miles, east and west.\r\n\r\nDr. Gilmore is a member of the Missouri Valley Veterinary Association,\r\nand the National veterinary fraternity, the Kansas City chapter of the\r\nDelta Alpha Psi. He is a Republican in politics and is fraternally\r\naffiliated with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows lodge and the\r\nKnights and Ladies of Security. Dr. Gilmore takes a keen and active\r\ninterest in the civic welfare of Effingham and is usually found in the\r\nforefront of undertakings which are intended to promote the best\r\ninterests of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ALFRED JONATHAN HARWI.\r\n\r\nIn writing the history of a city and county such as Atchison, the\r\nreviewer very naturally finds that among the large number of men who\r\nhave had much to do with the upbuilding of the community, and who can be\r\ncounted among the really successful men of the period covered, there are\r\nfew who stand out preëminently among their fellows, and whose\r\nindividuality looms far above the average, and who are noted not only\r\nfor their individual accomplishments on their own behalf, but who have\r\nperformed deeds which have endeared their memory to posterity for\r\ngenerations to come. In this respect we must consider the late Alfred\r\nJonathan Harwi, founder of the great A. J. Harwi Hardware Company,\r\nmillionaire, statesman, and philanthropist, of Atchison. Mr. Harwi will\r\nlong be remembered as one of the leading figures in the business world\r\nof Atchison. He was a pioneer in the establishment of the great\r\nwholesale houses which have made Atchison famous over the western\r\ncountry. Beginning his career a poor man, endowed with financial and\r\nbusiness ability of a high order, blessed with a keen foresight into the\r\nfuture, having confidence in the ultimate development of the country,\r\ntireless and industrious in all his undertakings, he achieved a truly\r\nremarkable success, and through it all he was a man among men, who never\r\nlost the respect and regard of his fellow men because of his great\r\nsuccess in the realms of business and finance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _A. J. Harwi_\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlfred Jonathan Harwi was born at Ritterville, Lehigh county,\r\nPennsylvania, January 21, 1847, the eldest of four sons, born to Michael\r\nand Lucretia Harwi. One of the children died in infancy, and the others,\r\nEdwin C. and W. H., followed Alfred J. to Atchison and became associated\r\nwith him in the hardware business which he had established. Edwin C.\r\ndied September 4, 1903, and Wilson H. Harwi died May 30, 1911. A sister\r\ndied in Pennsylvania when but a child. Michael Harwi followed the trade\r\nof carpenter in heavy construction work during his life, and was engaged\r\nin the building of canal locks in the days when the construction of\r\ninternal waterways was in vogue. He was also a farmer, and at the time\r\nof his death was engaged in quarrying and contracting for slate. His\r\nsons having all come to the West, he made preparations to join them here\r\nin Atchison, but on the point of his departure on October 8, 1882, he\r\nwas taken ill and died. His widow, Lucretia Harwi, then came to Atchison\r\nand resided here with her children until her demise, in November, 1904.\r\n\r\nA. J. Harwi received his education in the schools of his native State,\r\nattending the district school of his neighborhood until ten years of\r\nage, then becoming a student at a Moravian school in Bethlehem, which\r\nwas located four miles from his home and required him to walk the\r\ndistance across a mountain both morning and evening. After spending two\r\nyears in diligent study in this institution he entered a general store\r\nat Bethlehem for the purpose of acquiring business experience. However,\r\nwhile learning the art of barter and trade over the counters of the\r\ngeneral store he did not neglect the cultivation of his mind. He read,\r\nlistened and learned, and in his spare time continued his studies until\r\nhis mind was broadened and he became a man of advanced thought, learned\r\nto read and judge his fellow men, and acquire a refinement and polish\r\nwhich in later years assisted him in his undertakings and enabled him to\r\ncommand the respect of his fellows. His ambition was to eventually\r\nengage in business for himself, and he saved his money to this end, and\r\nin 1868, when he was twenty-one years of age, he became a partner in the\r\nfurniture business with J. B. Zimmele, but sold out two years later and\r\nhearkened to the advice of Horace Greeley, who said: “Go west, young\r\nman, go west, and grow up with the country.” While at Bethlehem Mr.\r\nHarwi married Cora Wheeler, with whose father he became associated in\r\nthe hardware and implement business at Butler, Mo. When this partnership\r\nwas dissolved a few years later, Mr. Harwi went to Cedar Rapids, Iowa,\r\nand for a few months was a clerk in a hardware store. In the year 1875\r\nhe came to Atchison equipped with considerable commercial experience,\r\nbut having little capital. He and C. H. Dearborn began a retail hardware\r\nbusiness in a small way in the building at 408 Commercial street. The\r\nconcern prospered from the start and its success was undoubtedly due to\r\nMr. Harwi’s intelligence and common-sense business methods and his\r\nwonderful capacity for hard and unremitting work. This hardware business\r\nsoon became one of the leading local business enterprises of the rapidly\r\ngrowing city of Atchison. Like other men who have been successful in\r\nlife, Mr. Harwi was visionary, but his vision did not take on the dream-\r\nlike character. It was practical and foresaw the inevitable development\r\nof the western country and an increased demand for all kinds of products\r\nas the country became more and more settled. He believed in common with\r\nothers of the period that Atchison was destined to become the gateway\r\nand the distributing point for a large section of territory. Acting upon\r\nthis sound, practical belief in the early eighties when the retail\r\nbusiness had assumed large proportions and necessitated expansion in\r\nother ways, he conceived the idea of engaging in the jobbing business.\r\nHe did so, and again his wonderful business acumen and ability came into\r\nplay, with the result that the A. J. Harwi Hardware Company is known\r\nthroughout the West and middle West, and has done a noteworthy part in\r\nmaking Atchison famous as a wholesale center. The result of its\r\nfounder’s vision and industry is one of the great wholesale houses of\r\nthe West, represented by about twenty traveling salesmen covering four\r\nStates, while over fifty local employes are engaged to handle the vast\r\namount of office work and the great warehouse and shipping details\r\nincident to such an important commercial institution as the A. J. Harwi\r\nHardware Company has developed into within thirty-five years. Their\r\ncommodious four-story office and warehouse building, located on the\r\ncorner of Commercial and Ninth streets, is one of the handsome modern\r\nbusiness houses of Atchison. One can begin to realize the scope and\r\nextent of this business when he stops to think that it requires 75,000\r\nfeet of floor space to afford ample warehouse facilities. In 1889 the A.\r\nJ. Harwi Hardware Company was incorporated with a capital stock of\r\n$100,000.\r\n\r\nMr. Harwi was three times married. His first wife, Cora Wheeler, whom he\r\nmarried in Bethlehem, left one daughter, Mrs. E. P. Ripley, of Boston.\r\nHis second marriage was with Elizabeth Whitehead, of Atchison, in 1873,\r\nto which union two children were born: Mrs. H. P. Shedd, of Bensonhurst,\r\nLong Island, and Frank E., president of the A. J. Harwi Hardware\r\nCompany. The mother of these children died October 14, 1907. Mr. Harwi’s\r\nthird marriage occurred June 3, 1909, to Mrs. Mary E. Holland, who\r\nsurvives him. Mr. Harwi passed away September 5, 1910. During his later\r\nyears the stress of business and the ceaseless activity which had been\r\nhis lot during life began to tell upon him, and for over twenty-five\r\nyears prior to his demise he was a sufferer from locomotor ataxia. The\r\nthings which he accomplished necessarily demanded that he be a hard and\r\ntireless worker, but he never spared himself, and at a time when he\r\nshould have begun to conserve his bodily strength he worked the hardest,\r\nwith the result that his span of life was shortened under what it might\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone through the magnificent mercantile concern which Mr.\r\nHarwi conceived and built up that he is known, but he was a public\r\nspirited gentleman who contributed generously to charity and\r\nphilanthropic work. Although he accumulated wealth outside of his\r\nbusiness to exceed a half million dollars and loaned out considerable\r\nmoney on mortgages, he was never known to have taken advantage of a\r\ndebtor and to foreclose a mortgage. Although he was a member of the\r\nCongregational church, he was a trustee of Midland College, Atchison,\r\nand established and endowed the Harwi scholarship prizes, which have\r\nbeen of inestimable benefit to many young students. He was one of the\r\ntrustees of the Atchison County High School at Effingham, and was also a\r\nwarm advocate of providing well for the education of the youth of the\r\ncommunity. Mr. Harwi was elected State senator from the Atchison\r\ndistrict in 1884, but did not allow his duties as legislator to\r\ninterfere with his business affairs, it being his custom while the\r\nlegislature was in session to spend the day in the legislative halls at\r\nTopeka, return home and spend the greater part of the night in the\r\nsupervision of the business. His ability as a legislator came naturally\r\ninto the limelight, and there was talk of running him as the party’s\r\ncandidate for governor of the State, but this talk met with little\r\nencouragement from Mr. Harwi, inasmuch as he was wrapped up heart and\r\nsoul in the reorganized Harwi Hardware Company at the time, the project\r\ndemanding all of his time and energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FRANK EDWIN HARWI.\r\n\r\nFrank Edwin Harwi, president of the A. J. Harwi Hardware Company, is one\r\nof Atchison’s live young citizens who is following in the footsteps of\r\nhis highly successful father. Mr. Harwi is in charge of the extensive\r\nwholesale hardware concern founded and built up by his father, A. J.\r\nHarwi. Frank E. Harwi was born October 11, 1884, in Atchison. He\r\nreceived his education in the public schools of his native city and in\r\nthe Andover Preparatory School at Andover, Mass. He matriculated as a\r\nfreshman at Yale University, but was called home by the illness of his\r\nfather, and he became his father’s assistant for the ensuing year. In\r\n1905 he entered the sophomore class of Kansas University, but gave up\r\nhis college course in 1906 to enter his father’s hardware establishment,\r\nand upon his father’s demise took over the active management of the\r\nconcern and became president of the A. J. Harwi Hardware Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Harwi was married September 30, 1908, to Miss Florence Cain, a\r\ndaughter of John M. and Lucy Cain. To this union two children have been\r\nborn: Alfred J., born August 22, 1909, and Lucy E., born January 12,\r\n1912. John M. Cain, father of Mrs. Harwi, was born July 30, 1839, at\r\nCastletown, Isle of Man. He was educated in the select schools of his\r\nnative island, learned the carpenter’s trade and emigrated from the Isle\r\nof Man in 1856, locating in Kansas, where he was successively farmer,\r\nsoldier, merchant and banker. He was a volunteer soldier in the company\r\norganized by A. S. Speck and Asa Barnes, and was accepted for service in\r\n1862, enlisting in Capt. P. H. McNamara’s company, of which he became\r\nsergeant, and upon the organization of the regiments of colored troops\r\nhe was appointed first lieutenant of a company in the Eighty-third\r\nregiment, colored infantry. He was afterwards commissioned a captain and\r\ndid splendid service throughout the Civil war. After the close of the\r\nwar he farmed in Atchison county, became a merchant, and was connected\r\nwith the old Atchison State Bank. He died in 1897. Mr. Cain was married\r\nMay 15, 1879, to Lucy Neerman, a daughter of Frank and Isabella (Rust)\r\nNeerman. The following children were born of this marriage Eva, wife of\r\nFoster Branson, of River Forest, Ill.; Ralph R., a banker, at Ada,\r\nOkla.; Florence, wife of Frank E. Harwi; John Milton, with the A. J.\r\nHarwi Hardware Company: William O., an attorney in Atchison, and Alfred\r\nNeerman, deceased.\r\n\r\nMr. Harwi is an independent in politics. He was one of the organizers of\r\nthe Atchison Commercial Club and served as president of this thriving\r\norganization in 1913, and is at present a member of its board of\r\ndirectors. He is a member of the board of trustees of Midland College\r\nand is a member of the Atchison city board of education. He has likewise\r\nbeen one of the trustees of the Atchison city hospital since its\r\nestablishment. While the responsibilities connected with the conduct of\r\nthe great business establishment thrust upon his shoulders at the demise\r\nof his father have been such as would probably daunt the young man of\r\naverage ability, Mr. Harwi has shown that he fully measures up to the\r\nrequirements of his important position in the mercantile world and has\r\nmade a reputation on his own individual account as a business head of\r\ndecided executive ability of a high order.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOSEPH TROMPETER.\r\n\r\nWhen Joseph Trumpeter departed this life Effingham lost one of its best\r\nand most-highly respected citizens and his family suffered the lost of a\r\nkind and industrious husband and father, whose sole ambition in life was\r\nto provide well for his kindred and those dependent upon him for a\r\nlivelihood, and to accomplish his purpose in the most honorable and\r\nupright manner possible. To him fell the task of erecting the first\r\ncounty high school building in Effingham, and many of the most\r\npretentious dwellings of the city were built by him. He was one of the\r\nwidely known and successful contractors of the county, whose operations\r\nextended over a wide stretch of territory, and whose work was always\r\nstrictly up to a certain high standard and honestly performed.\r\n\r\nMr. Trompeter was born June 15, 1857, in Prussia, Germany, and when ten\r\nyears of age he accompanied his parents to America. His father was\r\nMaurice Trompeter, who settled on a farm in Illinois and who went from\r\nIllinois to Texas, but after a short residence in that State returned to\r\nIllinois, where he passed the remainder of his days. Joseph was reared\r\nto young manhood in Illinois and there married Hannah Sowers. He also\r\nwent to Texas and removed from there to Horton, Kan. His father before\r\nhim was a carpenter and Joseph learned his trade and followed it,\r\nbecoming a contractor and builder when a young man. He erected several\r\ncourt houses in Texas, and built several school buildings and church\r\nedifices in Kansas. His first wife died in Horton, Kan., eight children\r\nbeing born to this union, of whom two are living, namely: Mrs. Tina\r\nDemmer, of Effingham. Kan.; Mrs. Bertha Wallace, also residing in\r\nEffingham. Mr. Trumpeter removed to Effingham, and at once engaged in\r\nbuilding and contracting on an extensive scale. He erected all the\r\nbuildings on the main street of the town, on the north side of the\r\nstreet, running from the banners and Merchants Bank building to the\r\nnewspaper office, at the end of the block. He also built the greater\r\npart of the finer residences in Effingham and it is due to his handiwork\r\nand taste that the city presents such an attractive appearance to the\r\nvisitor. In the spring of 1912 he and the family moved to his farm of\r\n160 acres southeast of Effingham on which with his own hands Mr.\r\nTrompeter erected a handsome farm dwelling and fitted it with all modern\r\nimprovements, adding an attractive barn at the same time. He did not\r\nlive to enjoy the comforts of his new home long, however, as illness\r\nbrought on by overwork, caused him to take to his bed and his demise\r\noccurred August 19, 1915.\r\n\r\nHis second marriage was with Louise Richter, on November 8, 1892, at\r\nEffingham. Four children were born of this marriage, namely: Amelia,\r\nJohn, James and Mary, all of whom are at home with their mother. Mrs.\r\nTrompeter was born in Austria, in 1874, a daughter of John, born\r\nSeptember 2, 1852, and Amelia (Wohletz) Richter, born May 31, 1849. The\r\nRichters are of German birth and immigrated to America in 1882, first\r\nresiding in Atchison and then coming to Effingham. For twenty-eight\r\nyears Mr. Richter was employed in railroad work on the Central Branch of\r\nthe Missouri Pacific railroad. Mr. and Mrs. Richter now make their home\r\nwith their daughter, Mrs. Trompeter, and assist in the farming\r\noperations. The Richter children are as follows: Mrs. Joseph Trompeter;\r\nDomineck, conducting a meat market in Effingham; Leapold, living at\r\nTacoma, Wash., also a builder and contractor; Mrs. Amelia Hansen,\r\nresiding in Texas; Mrs. Anna Royer, Tacoma, Wash. There are eleven grand\r\nchildren in the Richter family.\r\n\r\nMr. Trompeter was affiliated with the Democratic party, but was never a\r\nseeker after political preferment. He was a member of the Catholic\r\nchurch, and was fraternally connected with the Knights of Columbus and\r\nthe Modern Woodmen. Throughout his life he was an industrious and hard-\r\nworking citizen who did his duty as he saw it and lived an upright and\r\nhonest life. He was prominently identified with the civic life of\r\nEffingham and was highly respected for his many excellent qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOSEPH N. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\nJoseph N. Arthur, automobile salesman and garage proprietor, of\r\nEffingham, Kan., is one of the progressive and enterprising business men\r\nof the second city of Atchison county. Signal success has attended his\r\nefforts during the years he has been a resident of Atchison county. He\r\nembarked in the automobile business and established a garage in\r\nEffingham, despite the fact that predictions were made that the venture\r\nwould not be a success, and Mr. Arthur as a result is the recognized\r\npioneer automobile man of his part of the county. Since taking the\r\nagency for the Ford cars in 1912, he has sold over half the total of\r\nFord cars sold in the county and vicinity. Mr. Arthur first started in\r\nbusiness in 1910 and established a small garage in the rear of his real\r\nestate office. His business grew to such an extent that larger quarters\r\nbecame necessary, and in 1913 he erected a large concrete building,\r\nforty by eighty feet in extent, in which is incorporated his office,\r\ndisplay and repair rooms. He employs a skilled mechanic, assistant and\r\ndriver. Mr. Arthur handles the Dodge Brothers, the Maxwell, and Ford\r\nautomobiles.\r\n\r\nJ. N. Arthur was born June 3, 1869, near Corning, Adams county, Iowa,\r\nand is a son of John and Martha Arthur, natives of Ohio. Both parents\r\nwere reared in the old Buckeye State, and were early pioneer settlers in\r\nIowa, coming from Bucyrus, Ohio, in 1855, and driving overland via the\r\nox team route, with all their movable possessions loaded on wagons en\r\nroute from St. Joseph, Mo., to their destination in Adams county, Iowa.\r\nJohn Arthur homesteaded Government land in Adams county and preëmpted\r\nalong the river where timber and water were plentiful. He prospered as\r\nthe years went on and the country became more and more settled, and he\r\nbecame the owner of over 800 acres of excellent Iowa farm lands. He\r\nresided in Adams county, Iowa, until his demise, in 1907.\r\n\r\nJohn Arthur settled on the banks of a river for the purpose of having\r\ntimber, fuel and water, three essentials in keeping alive in the then\r\nsparsely settled country in the southwestern part of Iowa. He built a\r\nlog cabin of logs hewn from trees chopped down with his own hands and\r\nchinked the cracks and crevices with mud. When he preëmpted his first\r\ntract of land in Iowa he had a yoke of oxen, $10 in money and a favorite\r\nbull-dog, things which he was fond of telling about as he grew older and\r\nmore prosperous. During his fifty-two years of residence in Iowa he\r\naccumulated 800 acres of land and had money loaned out to the amount of\r\n$10,000. He was the father of eleven children, nine of whom grew to\r\nmaturity, each of whom as he married was assisted by the father to\r\nsettle on a farm of his own, and all have prospered—an enviable record\r\nfor a pioneer family to make.\r\n\r\nJoseph N., with whom this review is directly concerned, was reared on\r\nthe Iowa farm, and knew something about the hardships of the pioneer\r\ndays in his boyhood. He attended the district school in his\r\nneighborhood, and followed farming until he engaged in the implement\r\nbusiness in his home county for some years, with a fair degree of\r\nsuccess. He left his native State in 1904 and came to Effingham, Kan.,\r\npurchasing 120 acres of land about one and one-half miles distant from\r\nEffingham in Atchison county. One year later he embarked in the real\r\nestate business, in partnership with B. F. Snyder. This partnership\r\nlasted for two years and then Mr. Arthur engaged in the business for\r\nhimself. He also began to write insurance, and was reasonably successful\r\nin both the real estate and insurance business. He erected a brick\r\nbuilding for his office quarters, and, when automobile owners multiplied\r\nin Effingham and vicinity he foresaw the need of a repair shop and\r\nestablished one in the rear of his real estate office. He soon afterward\r\nrented an abandoned garage and hired a mechanic to do the repair work.\r\nIt was not long until larger quarters became necessary, and he built as\r\ntold in a preceding chapter. In July of 1915, Mr. Arthur disposed of his\r\ninsurance business, and has since devoted his energies entirely to the\r\nautomobile business.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1892 to Lillie M. Ramsey, daughter of Newton Ramsey, a\r\npioneer settler of Adams county, Iowa, and a Union veteran of the Civil\r\nwar. Four children have blessed this union: Pearl, aged twenty-one\r\nyears; Jennie, aged eighteen years, and a teacher of music, and an\r\naccomplished musician; Le Roy, nine years of age; Charles, three years\r\nold. Three children are deceased: Chester A. died at the age of eight\r\nyears; Milton died at the age of eighteen months; Blanche died at the\r\nage of nine months.\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur is a Republican in politics, and has identified himself more\r\nor less with the civic life of his adopted community, and is considered\r\nas one of Effingham’s best boosters and live wires. He is a member of\r\nthe Methodist Episcopal church, contributes to the support of the same,\r\nand is affiliated with the Odd Fellows lodge and the Knights and Ladies\r\nof Security.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DON CARLOS NEWCOMB.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure for the biographer to write a story of the life of a\r\nman who has arrived at the evening of life and be able to record\r\nsomething really worth while for the benefit of posterity. The life\r\nannals of a man who has succeeded in making a name for himself,\r\nachieving a well deserved competence, and been of some use to his\r\ncommunity, and has arrived at the time of life when he can look back\r\nover the vista of the busy years that have passed, is interesting to a\r\nhigh degree. In D. C. Newcomb, pioneer merchant and patriarch, of\r\nAtchison, we find embodied that spirit of the West which enabled men to\r\nbuild up this great country and to achieve things of importance in the\r\nbusiness and civic world. Mr. Newcomb loves his home city, its people\r\nand prestige and is proud of its standing among the cities of the West.\r\nHe has had no small part in the upbuilding of Atchison, and it would\r\nhave been better in the days gone by if the city had more men like him\r\nto assist its growth. Ever ready to contribute to any enterprise which\r\nmight help the growth of the city, his liberality and boosting\r\nproclivities became proverbial, and it has oft been a saying of his that\r\nAtchison could just as well have been a city of fifty or sixty thousand\r\ninhabitants as to be its present size. Such men as he are of decided\r\nbenefit to any community.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Eng. by E. G. Williams & Bro. N. Y._\r\n\r\n  _D. C. Newcomb_\r\n]\r\n\r\nD. C. Newcomb, a pioneer merchant of Atchison, perhaps has had as much\r\nto do with the commercial development of Atchison county for the past\r\nhalf century as any other man within its borders. When Mr. Newcomb came\r\nto Atchison county in 1858 it was a difficult matter to tell whether\r\nAtchison, or its rival town, Sumner, was to be the chief town of the\r\ncounty. Sumner was a thriving frontier town, but Mr. Newcomb picked\r\nAtchison as the winner and time has demonstrated that his judgment was\r\nsound. D. C. Newcomb was born in Washington county, Vermont, on Friday,\r\nJuly 13, 1836, and is a son of Hosea and Harriet (Bixby) Newcomb, the\r\nformer a native of New Hampshire and the latter a native of Roxbury,\r\nMass., born in 1805. Hosea Newcomb was born in 1803 and came from a\r\nprominent New England family of English descent. The Newcomb family was\r\nfounded in New England in 1635 by Francis Newcomb and his wife, who came\r\nfrom England and located in New England at that time. It is recorded\r\nthat they made the voyage on a sailing vessel named “Planter.” Hosea\r\nNewcomb, the father of D. C., was prominent in the affairs of his native\r\ntown, Waitsfield, Vt., where he remained until 1859, when he came to\r\nKansas, settling at the new town of Sumner, now extinct, in Atchison\r\ncounty. He took an active part in the early-day development of that\r\npromising frontier town and served as postmaster there. However, he\r\nreturned to Vermont in 1873, where he died in 1889, at the age of\r\neighty-six, and his wife passed away March 17, 1903, age ninety-seven\r\nyears, eight months and one day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Residence of D. C. Newcomb, Atchison, Kan.\r\n]\r\n\r\nD. C. Newcomb was one of a family of five children and is now the only\r\none living, except a sister, Mrs. Lydia M. Shephard, of Minneapolis. A\r\nbrother, Dan J. Newcomb, was a very early settler in Atchison county,\r\ncoming here some time before D. C. arrived. He was prominent in the\r\norganization of Atchison county and was the first register of deeds of\r\nthe county, D. C. serving as his deputy. D. C. Newcomb was reared in the\r\ntown of Waitsfield, Vt., where he attended the public schools and later\r\nwas a student at Newbury Seminary. In early life he clerked in a store\r\nat Johnson, Vt., and also clerked for a time in Montpelier, Vt. In 1858\r\nhe came to Atchison county and first landed at Sumner, but immediately\r\nwent to Atchison, and, although the latter town was also in its early\r\nstages of development, the location impressed Mr. Newcomb so favorably\r\nthat he determined to locate there. Soon after coming here he was\r\nappointed deputy register of deeds and served in that capacity for three\r\nyears. He then engaged in clerking in a store, and in 1864 entered into\r\npartnership with Samuel Gard, who had been a fellow clerk of his, and\r\nthey organized the firm of Gard & Newcomb and engaged in the mercantile\r\nbusiness. Their capital was limited, perhaps less than $2,500, but they\r\nwere two industrious young men and had a reputation for honesty and\r\nsquare dealing, which was an important asset. Mr. Newcomb went to New\r\nYork and bought a stock of goods valued at about $15,000, mostly on\r\ncredit, and at the end of the first year they had paid for every\r\ndollar’s worth of goods which they had bought in the meantime and had a\r\nstock of about $15,000 worth on hand. The partnership arrangement\r\ncontinued about four years, when Mr. Newcomb purchased his partner’s\r\ninterest, who desired to dispose of his business on account of failing\r\nhealth. Mr. Newcomb continued in business alone and conducted the great\r\nNewcomb department store, the business of which developed far beyond his\r\nmost fanciful dreams. Mr. Newcomb continued in the mercantile business\r\nuntil 1905, and for years was the leading merchant of Atchison. He sold\r\nhis business to Ed Lake, who has conducted it since 1905.\r\n\r\nMr. Newcomb has not only been a merchant prince in northeastern Kansas,\r\nbut has been identified with the growth and development of Atchison from\r\nmany standpoints. He was one of the organizers of the First National\r\nBank and was closely identified with that financial institution for\r\nfifteen years. He served successively as director, vice-president and\r\npresident, but when he went out of business he disposed of his banking\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nMr. Newcomb was united in marriage in 1866 with Miss Anna E., daughter\r\nof Capt. George W. Bowman, an early-day steamboat captain, but later\r\nengaged in the mercantile business at Atchison. He was a native of\r\nBrownsville, Pa. To Mr. and Mrs. Newcomb have been born two children:\r\nHattie May, now the wife of Maj. Harry A. Smith, U. S. A., a graduate of\r\nWest Point Military Academy. During the Spanish-American war he held the\r\nrank of major in the Twenty-first regiment, Kansas infantry, and is now\r\nmajor in the Twenty-eighth regiment, United States infantry, doing duty\r\non the Mexican border. To Major Smith and wife have been born two\r\nchildren: Newcomb, a cadet in the United States Military Academy, West\r\nPoint, N. Y., and William A., a graduate of Shattick’s school,\r\nFairibault, Minn., now a student in the University of Minnesota. George\r\nEdgar, the youngest child born to Mr. and Mrs. Newcomb, born March 19,\r\n1869, died March 25, 1909, aged forty years. He was married in October,\r\n1895, to Miss Dorothy Jones, a native of Wisconsin, and three children\r\nwere born to this union: Clara Forest, D. C., and Charles Jones. Mr.\r\nNewcomb has been a life-long Republican and has always supported the\r\npolicies and principles of that party. He has had many flattering\r\ninducements to enter politics, but has refused to accept, preferring to\r\nfollow his commercial career in which he has been so successful. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Newcomb are members of the Methodist Episcopal church, and for\r\nyears have been active in the work of their congregation and both have\r\nlived exemplary Christian lives. Mr. Newcomb has held every office\r\nwithin the gift of the church, all of which have come to him without\r\nsolicitation. In fact, every preferment has come to him unsolicited. In\r\n1896 and 1900 he was elected a lay delegate to the general conference of\r\nthe Methodist Episcopal church held at Omaha in 1896 and Chicago in\r\n1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WILSON R. SMITH.\r\n\r\nWilson R. Smith, of the firm of Snyder, Smith & Company, Effingham,\r\nKan., is an admirable type of a successful business man who has been a\r\nresident of Effingham for the past six years, and has so identified\r\nhimself with the life of the community that it seems to the average\r\ncitizen that Mr. Smith has been a resident of the city and county all of\r\nhis natural life. The firm, of which he is an active member, handles\r\nhardware, implements, grain, coal and feed, and is composed of G. M.\r\nSnyder, W. R. Smith and U. B. Sharpless, present county treasurer. This\r\nfirm was organized in February of 1915 and took over the business of\r\nSharpless & Snyder. The concern also operates a grain elevator of 10,000\r\nbushel capacity, and has two large warehouses and coal-yards, in\r\naddition to the business room on Main street.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith is a Virginian by birth, and was born at Salt Sulphur Springs,\r\nMonroe county, W. Va., on April 28, 1856. He is a son of Granville and\r\nCaroline (Clark) Smith, both of whom were born and reared in Virginia,\r\nand were descended from colonial ancestors. A direct ancestor of Wilson\r\nR. was the first settled in Monroe county, and headed a long line of\r\ntillers of the soil, the parents of Wilson R. living on their farm in\r\nVirginia until their deaths.\r\n\r\nWilson R. left his ancestral home in Virginia in April of 1884 and\r\njourneyed to the town of Craig, Holt county, Missouri, purchasing a farm\r\nin the neighborhood of Mounty City, which he cultivated with\r\nconsiderable success for ten years, and then engaged in the grain and\r\nstock business for a period of nine years. He resided in Holt county\r\nuntil 1909 and then came to Effingham, Kan. His first venture here was\r\nin the grain and elevator business, which he conducted for a period of\r\nfour years, and then sold out to the Farmers’ Elevator Company. In\r\nFebruary of 1915, he purchased an interest in the business in which he\r\nis now engaged. Continuous success has followed Mr. Smith’s efforts, and\r\npractically every business venture in which he has embarked has proved\r\nto be uniformly successful. His methods of transacting business are\r\nabove reproach and are such as to commend him to the public in general.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1885 to Mrs. Celia C. Zachary, a widow, who was the\r\nmother of one child, Edith Belle, by a former marriage. Two children\r\nhave blessed this marriage: Alberta, wife of Ross Meador, living on a\r\nfarm, five miles southwest of Effingham; Jennie, wife of C. A. Hawk,\r\nresiding three miles north of Effingham on a farm.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith is a stanch Republican in his political affiliations, and is a\r\nmember of the Modern Woodmen and the Brotherhood of American Yeoman. He\r\nis one of Effingham’s substantial and enterprising citizens, who is ever\r\nready to assist his adopted community to better the conditions of things\r\nin general and readily lends a hand when needed to assist the growth and\r\nwell being of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GEORGE E. HENDEE.\r\n\r\nMr. Hendee is an automobile salesman, machinist and garage proprietor,\r\nis one of Atchison’s hustling business men who has made good in the\r\nautomobile business. Seven years in the motor industry in Atchison has\r\nseen him advance in his chosen work until he now owns the largest and\r\nbest equipped garage in the city, and has a plant including equipment\r\nand cars in stock valued at over $15,000. Mr. Hendee is salesman for the\r\nRegal, Chalmers and the White automobiles.\r\n\r\nHe was born on a farm in Lancaster county, Nebraska, July 31, 1872,\r\nbeing a son of George and Loretta (Kistler) Hendee, who were the parents\r\nof five children: William, deceased; Mrs. Margaret Bennethy, of\r\nLogansport, Ind.; George E.; Delbert, of Logansport, Ind., and Leona, at\r\nhome with her parents. George Hendee, Sr., was born in Canada, in 1846,\r\nremoving from his native country to Indiana with his parents when a boy.\r\nHe was reared to young manhood in Indiana and served as a soldier in\r\nCompany G, Twenty-first regiment, Indiana infantry, until the close of\r\nthe war, in 1865. After the Civil war he migrated to Lancaster county,\r\nNebraska, and homesteaded on 160 acres of Government land. He built up a\r\nsplendid farm from the raw and unbroken prairie and prospered as he\r\ndeserved, living on his acreage until 1891, at which time he started a\r\ngeneral store at Panama, Neb. He retired from active pursuits in 1898\r\nand moved to Royal Center, Ind., where he is now living. The Hendee\r\nfamily is of French origin, and the founders of the family first settled\r\nin the Dominion of Canada. The mother of George E. was born in\r\nPennsylvania in 1842, a daughter of Pennsylvania Dutch parents.\r\n\r\nHe of whom this review is written was reared on the Nebraska farm and\r\nreceived his elementary schooling at Panama and York, that State. Early\r\nin life he displayed an aptitude for machinery and determined to fit\r\nhimself to become an expert machinist. Accordingly, in 1895, he enrolled\r\nas student in the State University at Lawrence, and pursued the\r\nmachinist’s course, having previously studied electrical engineering at\r\nYork, Neb. When thirteen years of age, George started out to make his\r\nown way, educate himself and at the same time earn his living. While a\r\nstudent in the York Technical School, he worked nights in the electric\r\nlight plant. For a period of three years he was a fireman on the\r\nChicago, Burlington & Quincy railroad and the Santa Fe System, being\r\npromoted to the post of railway engineer while in the employ of the\r\nlatter system, He was then employed by the General Electric Company, of\r\nChicago, in the installation of and erecting mining machinery. his\r\nduties requiring him to travel in the South for over a year. He was\r\nemployed by the Chalmers company for one year erecting heavy engines,\r\nand was employed as engineer of the Pearsons’ Flouring Mills at\r\nLawrence, Kan., for seven years. For a time he served as master mechanic\r\nat the Leavenworth coal shaft on the Government grounds at Leavenworth,\r\nKan. In the year 1901 he built and operated a machine shop at Cripple\r\nCreek, Colo., but his plant was destroyed by fire in 1902. He then moved\r\nto Grand Junction, Colo., where he worked in the oil fields and was\r\nround house foreman for the railroads in that city until he resigned his\r\nposition and located in Denver, Colo., where he worked as a machinist in\r\nthe Missouri Pacific shops until he took employment as engineer on the\r\nColorado & Southern railway. After this he was employed as a machinist\r\nin the shops of the Santa Fe railroad, but resigned this place to become\r\nforeman in the plant of the Locomotive Finished Material Foundry in\r\nAtchison. Following this he was chief engineer for the Blair Milling\r\nCompany, resigning to take employment as an expert machinist with the\r\nAtchison Motor Company until 1908. In that year he engaged in business,\r\nand has made a name for himself in the motor and business world of\r\nAtchison. Mr. Hendee is looked upon as one of the rising and successful\r\nyoung business men of Atchison, and justly deserves all of the success\r\nwhich has come to him.\r\n\r\nHis marriage with Laura Hall, of Lawrence, Kan., occurred in 1902 and\r\ngave him a faithful helpmate who has assisted him in every way to\r\nachieve his present success. Two children were born of this marriage,\r\nVelva and Kenneth, both deceased. Mrs. Hendee was born in August, 1879,\r\nin Wisconsin, a daughter of John and Nettie (Crow) Hall, natives of\r\nWisconsin. She is a well educated lady and is a graduate of the college\r\nat Burlington, Kan. Mr. Hendee is an independent in political affairs,\r\nand is fraternally allied with the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons,\r\nIndependent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Modern Woodmen of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WILLIAM D. KISTLER.\r\n\r\nWilliam D. Kistler, prosperous farmer of Shannon township, is descendant\r\nof good old Pennsylvania Dutch stock, and has lived in Atchison county\r\nfor thirty-six years. He came to this county from his ancestral home in\r\nPennsylvania, in moderate circumstances, if not actually a poor man, and\r\nduring that time has accumulated a fine farm of 200 acres which ranks\r\namong the best and most productive farms of the county. The little shack\r\nin which he and his family lived when they first came to Kansas has been\r\nsuperseded by a handsome and comfortable residence and great shade trees\r\nhave grown up around it. The modest “eighty” in which Mr. Kistler\r\ninvested all of his small capital on his arrival here has grown steadily\r\nwith substantial additions from time to time as he was enabled to\r\npurchase adjoining tracts. A large red barn alike shows evidence of\r\nthrift and good management on the part of the proprietor.\r\n\r\nW. D. Kistler was born in Lehigh county, Pennsylvania, December 5, 1853,\r\na son of Nathan J. and Catharine (Dietrich) Kistler, both of whom were\r\nborn in the adjoining county near Lehigh county. Nathan J. Kistler was\r\nborn April 6, 1811, and died September 11, 1878. He was a son of Jacob\r\nS., who was a son of Samuel Kistler, whose father, John George Kistler,\r\nemigrated with his wife, Dorothia, from Germany and settled in\r\nPennsylvania early in the eighteenth century, arriving in Philadelphia\r\nOctober 5, 1737. Nathan J. Kistler was a captain of State militia and\r\ndied at the old home in Lehigh county. Two brothers of W. D. and a\r\nsister out of a family of nine children settled in the West. After his\r\npublic school training Mr. Kistler attended the Kutztown, Pennsylvania,\r\nNormal School and prepared himself for the teaching profession. He\r\ntaught school in his native State for four years, after which he clerked\r\nin a general store for four years, previous to migrating to Kansas. He\r\nleft the old home in Pennsylvania in 1879 and came to Atchison county,\r\nKansas, investing in an eighty-acre tract in Shannon township which he\r\ngradually improved. The small house which he first erected was gradually\r\nenlarged as the needs of his family demanded more room and his means\r\npermitted. In 1883 he erected the present handsome home, which is one of\r\nthe most attractive places in the township. Mr. Kistler raises cattle,\r\nhorses and hogs and feeds his grain products to the live stock on his\r\nfarm, thus managing to keep up the fertility of his acres and being able\r\nto market his farm products in the most profitable manner.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1876 to Ellen Brobst, who was born in Lehigh county,\r\nPennsylvania, in 1853, a daughter of Daniel and Lydia (Kunken) Brobst,\r\nof Lehigh county, and whose ancestry came from Germany. They are the\r\nparents of five children: Mrs. Alice Bunnell, of Lancaster township,\r\nthis county: Anna, wife of Samuel Du Bois, also of Shannon township;\r\nCalvin, a farmer, residing at the Du Bois home, and assisting in the\r\nmanagement of the farm; Bertha, wife of James Dooley, residing in\r\nShannon township; William, at home, married Catharine Wolters.\r\n\r\nMr. Kistler is a Republican in politics, but he has never been an office\r\nseeker, or sought preferment at the hands of his fellow citizens. He is\r\naffiliated with the Ancient Order of United Workmen. He and the members\r\nof his family stand well among their neighbors and are highly esteemed\r\nby all who know them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ANDREW KEITHLINE.\r\n\r\nThe late Andrew Keithline enjoyed the distinction of being one of the\r\noldest, if not the oldest living pioneer resident of Atchison. Fifty-six\r\nyears of his four score and seven years of life were spent in Atchison\r\nand vicinity. In the fulness of his years, and satisfied in the\r\nreflections concerning a long and useful life well spent he lived a\r\nquiet, retired life in his comfortable home at 1121 Santa Fe street\r\nuntil the Death Angel called him. He loved to meet his many friends and\r\nspeak reminiscently of the days when Atchison was in the embryo stage,\r\nand of the stirring scenes during the days when Kansas was in the throes\r\nof becoming an integral part of the great American Union. He was one of\r\nthe city’s grand old men who was universally loved and respected by all\r\nwho knew him. He came of that sturdy Pennsylvania German stock, noted\r\nthe country over for their sterling qualities of endurance and the\r\nability to do their share in the transformation of a wilderness to a\r\nland of homes and plenty.\r\n\r\nAndrew Keithline was born on a farm in Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, a\r\nson of John and Mary (Neyhart) Keithline. The first Keithline to come to\r\nAmerica was Colonel Keithline, who figures prominently in Revolutionary\r\nannals and who accompanied Baron De Kalb to this country in 1775. Andrew\r\nKeithline’s grandfather, Joseph Keithline, was born in Northhampton\r\ncounty, Pennsylvania, served in the War of 1812, and died in 1850. He\r\nwas a tailor by trade and contracted to make buckskin breeches for the\r\nGovernment, to be worn by the soldiers during the war. Joseph’s children\r\nwore buckskin breeches made by their father. John Keithline, the father\r\nof Andrew, operated a wagon shop which also served as the family\r\nresidence for some years, in fact, Andrew was born in his father’s wagon\r\nshop. He prospered, in the course of time and came west in 1863 and\r\ninvested in eighty acres of land, south of Atchison and later owned 320\r\nacres west of Atchison on the Parallel road. This tract was partly\r\nfenced at the time of purchase and cost John Keithline $25 per acre. He\r\nmade his home thereon and was joined by his family in 1864. The mother\r\nof Andrew died in 1865 and John returned to the old home in Pennsylvania\r\nwhere he died in 1868. Nine children were born to John Keithline and\r\nwife: Samuel, Catharine, Andrew, Julia, Sarah, Priscilla, John, Peter\r\nand Mary E. Of these, Samuel, Sarah and Andrew came to Atchison county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _A. Keithline_\r\n]\r\n\r\nAndrew left the parental home in December of 1857, and went to Michigan,\r\nremaining until 1859, when he came to Atchison, where he resided until\r\nthe fall of 1864. His first employment was with the firm of Walters &\r\nRoswell, who conducted a general store and wanted a clerk familiar with\r\nthe German tongue. For the two years previous to his locating in\r\nAtchison he conducted a coöperative store in Michigan. His first trip to\r\nthe Far West was taken in 1860, when he went to Denver and disposed of a\r\nstock of goods for his firm. He made another trip across the plains\r\nlater than this. In 1864 he was called out with the Kansas State militia\r\nto repel the Price invasion. On October 31, 1864, he moved to his farm\r\nwest of Atchison, and remained there tilling his acreage until September\r\n1, 1898, and made his permanent home in Atchison until his death. His\r\nfine farm consisted originally of 220 acres and when he removed to\r\nAtchison he still owned 190 acres of the original farm. Mr. Keithline\r\nbought a handsome brick residence on Santa Fe street and by wise\r\ninvestments and carefully husbanding his resources accumulated a\r\ncomfortable competence for the support of his declining years. He was\r\nconsidered a well-to-do citizen. He was married on November 5, 1854, to\r\nRose Varner, born in 1832 in Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, a daughter of\r\nGeorge Varner, whose father was a soldier in the Revolution. Two\r\nchildren were born to this well respected couple, namely: Gilbert, born\r\nin 1855, died in Jackson county in the spring of 1915. He was the father\r\nof seven children, Herschell, Sydney, Rose, Emma, Mary, Andrew and\r\nLaura. Mrs. Cora Warters, a daughter of Mr. Keithline, lives in\r\nAtchison. She is the mother of four children: Bessie, Andrew, Cora\r\nWillis and Lorene.\r\n\r\nMr. Keithline was one of the original Free State men of Kansas, and was\r\ninduced to come here by the fact that men in favor of making Kansas a\r\nfree State were needed in the Territory. He consistently espoused the\r\nprinciples of the Republican party, taking an active part in politics\r\nduring his younger days and served for two years as justice of the\r\npeace. One of the bright spots in his memory of bygone days was his warm\r\nfriendship for Senator John J. Ingalls, which friendship was\r\nreciprocated by the illustrious senator. He always adhered to the\r\nLutheran religious denomination, which was the faith of his fathers. The\r\nevening of life must come to us all and happy is the man who can calmly\r\nwait for the last call to summon him to his just reward in the world to\r\ncome, at peace with all mankind and cared for by capable hands; such was\r\nthe life of this fine old gentleman of whom it has been a pleasure to\r\nwrite this brief review.\r\n\r\nAndrew Keithline departed this life December 14, 1915. The end came\r\npeacefully, as he had wished. The worn-out body of this grand old\r\npatriarch ceased to be able to hold the immortal soul of one of the\r\ngrandest and best loved men of the early pioneer days of Atchison\r\ncounty. Mr. Keithline was a good and honest citizen whose upright and\r\nsturdy character will long prove an inspiration and guidance for the\r\npresent and future generations of Kansans who may peruse these pages. He\r\nwas a prominent factor in the building up of Atchison county, and was\r\nintimate with the great men of his day and generation. When his time\r\ncame and the Angel of Death called him to the long rest he was content\r\nto go and had no regrets. Death had no terrors for him as his life was\r\nunspotted and clean, and in keeping with the attributes of the man\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ABRAM STEVER.\r\n\r\nAbram Stever, one of the early settlers of Benton township, Atchison\r\ncounty, and now deceased, was born November 3, 1837, and departed this\r\nlife on July 27, 1881. He was born in Schoharie county, New York, a son\r\nof Abram and Nancy Stever, both of whom were born and reared in New York\r\nState, the father being a son of German parents, who were founders of\r\nthe family in this country. Two brothers emigrated from Germany, one of\r\nwhom settled in New York and the other made his home in Ohio. Abram was\r\nreared to young manhood in his native State and when twenty years of age\r\nmigrated to the new State of Wisconsin, then in process of settlement.\r\nHe became a farmer in Walworth county and cleared a home from the\r\ntimber. Five years later he was married, and in 1867 came to Kansas,\r\ndriving his movable possessions across the country, his wife and\r\nchildren coming by train to St. Joseph, Mo., where they crossed the\r\nMissouri river by ferry. The first location of the family was in Brown\r\ncounty, Kansas, where they lived until 1874 and then came to Atchison\r\ncounty, where Mr. Stever purchased 160 acres of wild prairie land in\r\nBenton township, one and three-fourths miles northwest of Effingham. He\r\nimproved his farm, erected a good home and beautified the premises with\r\nfine shade trees and shrubbery. After his demise in 1881, Mrs. Stever\r\nmade her home on the farm until 1893, when she removed to Effingham, and\r\nhas since resided here, with the exception of a few years’ residence in\r\nMankato, Jewell county, Kansas, with her daughter, maintaining a\r\npermanent home in Effingham.\r\n\r\nAbram Stever was married December 24, 1862, to Sarah Elecia Bailey, of\r\nWalworth county, Wisconsin. To this union have been born the following\r\nchildren: Leona May, died at the age of fifteen years; Jennie Bailey,\r\ndied at the age of thirteen; Joseph Warren, died when twenty-two years\r\nold; Arthur Carlton, a clothing merchant at Wetmore, Kan., who married\r\nMaud Hawk, of Effingham, and they have one daughter, Leona May; Carrie\r\nAdella Stever, at home with her mother, a graduate of the county high\r\nschool, and taught for seven years in the Effingham schools, and is a\r\nspecialist in music, having graduated from Bethany Conservatory at\r\nLindsborg, Kan., in 1906. She pursued a post-graduate course at\r\nLindsborg during winter vacation, and studied during one winter under\r\nWilliam H. Sherwood, America’s greatest pianist. She was for five years\r\na successful teacher of music at Mankato, Kan. Returning to Effingham in\r\n1911, she became music director in the Atchison County High School, but\r\nresigned to take up studio work entirely; Ray Howard, conducting a\r\nsuitatorium at Frankfort, Kan., married Inez McFarlan; Ralph Roy Stever,\r\na teamster at Nevada, Mo., married Treva Spell, and has had four\r\nchildren: Lloyd Orr, Warren Clayton, Ralph Vern, Lola Esther, deceased;\r\nErnest Clayton, a graduate of the county high school, proprietor of a\r\nsuitatorium at Macon, Mo., married Charlotte Henderson, and has one\r\nchild, Roy Estell; Frank Abram Stever, county high school graduate,\r\nlocated on the family estate in Benton township, married Daisy McFarlan,\r\nand is the father of three children: Coral Nadine, Geneva Fay, and\r\nMildred Lorene. Mrs. Stever was born January 10, 1843, on a farm in\r\nWalworth county, Wisconsin, a daughter of Joseph and Sarah (Perry)\r\nBailey, natives of Maryland and Dundee, Ill., respectively. An uncle,\r\nAmos Bailey, was one of the first surveyors in the city of Chicago, and\r\nrun the first line in what is now the city. Joseph Bailey was one of the\r\nfirst settlers in Walworth county, Wisconsin, at a time when there were\r\nvery few people in the State and neighbors were twelve miles distant\r\nfrom one another. It was a common custom for a number of settlers to\r\nband together and market their produce together in the city of Chicago.\r\nAmos Bailey was the owner of several sections of land near Lake Geneva,\r\nWis., which is now the great millionaires’ resort, near Chicago. Joseph\r\nBailey was twice married, his second wife being Mary Catharine Sipperly.\r\nIt is also worth recording that a brother of Abram Stever, named\r\nWashington Stever, was a soldier in the Union army and fought in the\r\nArmy of the Potomac from the beginning to the end of the war. At the\r\ntime of Mr. Stever’s death, the oldest son was only thirteen years of\r\nage, and Mrs. Stever was left with a large family, the youngest of whom\r\nwas six months old.\r\n\r\nAbram Stever was a Republican in his political affiliations, but will\r\nbest be remembered for his activity in behalf of the organization of the\r\nPresbyterian church in Effingham. He was one of three men who raised the\r\nfund to pay for the building of the First Presbyterian Church erected in\r\nEffingham, and was a deacon and trustee, having been one of the only two\r\ndeacons ever installed in the early church. He was active in church work\r\nduring his entire life and was a thoroughly honest, religious gentleman,\r\nwho carried his belief into his daily life and in all his undertakings.\r\nHe was a good husband, a kind parent and an excellent citizen, and loved\r\nby everyone who knew him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          REV. Z. S. HASTINGS.\r\n\r\nFew pioneer citizens of Atchison county have lived more useful or\r\ncleaner lives than Rev. Z. S. Hastings, retired minister and farmer, of\r\nEffingham, Kan. During his nearly fifty years of residence in Kansas as\r\na farmer, educator, preacher, and statesman, he has worked continually\r\nfor the well-being of his neighbors and friends. Without fear of\r\ncontradiction it can be stated that Rev. Hastings has performed a\r\ngreater number of marriage ceremonies and officiated at the funerals of\r\nmore deceased residents than any minister in Atchison county. Despite\r\nhis three score and seventeen years this grand old patriarch bears his\r\nage lightly and takes an active interest in the affairs of his\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nRev. Z. S. Hastings was born March 15, 1838, on a farm near Bedford,\r\nLawrence county, Indiana, a son of Howell and Edith (Edwards) Hastings,\r\nnatives of North Carolina. On his father’s side the family is of Quaker\r\norigin and a very old one in America. The first Hastings having been a\r\nfollower of William Penn, came from England to settle in the Quaker\r\ncolony in Pennsylvania. A descendant of the first American Hastings,\r\nJoshua by name, migrated to North Carolina and there founded another\r\nbranch of the family. Here in the Southland, Howell Hastings was reared\r\nand married, and with his wife and two sons migrated to Indiana to\r\nbecome one of the pioneer settlers of the Hoosier State. He died at his\r\nhome in Indiana December 25, 1854, leaving seven children: Joshua\r\nThomas, deceased; William Henry, John Arthur, Nancy Elizabeth, deceased;\r\nZachariah Simpson, with whom this review is concerned; Charlotte Ann,\r\ndeceased; Rufus Wiley, living in Arkansas. Of the foregoing, Joshua\r\nThomas and William Henry fought in the Union army during the late\r\nrebellion of the Southern States; Joshua first fought in the Home Guards\r\nof Missouri, and, returning to Indiana he raised a company for service\r\nin the war, after fighting under General Lyons at the battle of\r\nSpringfield. He taught school for a time in Missouri, but returned to\r\nIndiana. He died in Kentucky. William Henry enlisted in a Missouri\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nZ. S. Hastings was educated in the common schools of his native State,\r\nstudied in Indianapolis, and also pursued a course at Hiram College, in\r\npreparation for the Christian ministry. In 1857 he went to Missouri and\r\ntaught school for five years, studying in the meantime while teaching.\r\nIn 1862 he returned to his native State and began preaching the Gospel\r\nin the Christian denomination. He taught and preached at the same time\r\nwhile preparing himself further for the ministry. His first experience\r\nin the ministry was obtained in 1860 while in Missouri. In 1867 Mr.\r\nHastings came to Kansas, resided in Leavenworth county for one year and\r\nin 1868 came to Atchison county and located on a farm near Farmington.\r\nHe taught the Farmington school for five years and preached in the\r\nvicinity of his home during this time. He cultivated his farm of 130\r\nacres and preached at the Farmington church and in the surrounding\r\ncountry for a period of twenty-five years. In 1895 he removed to\r\nEffingham and continued preaching until 1903 when he retired from active\r\nwork in the ministry. Mr. Hastings was an excellent farmer as well as\r\nminister and made a success of his farming operations, having the\r\ndistinction of selling an eighty acre tract of farm land, the first for\r\n$100 an acre ever sold in the county up to that time. This farm was\r\nlocated east of Effingham, and was the first tract near the town to\r\nbring the price of $100 an acre.\r\n\r\nHe was married on June 28, 1870, to Miss Rosetta Butler, and to this\r\nunion have been born seven children: Harry Howell, an electrical\r\nengineer, located at St. Louis, and who was educated in Holton College\r\nand Kansas University; Paul Pardee, assistant freight and passenger\r\nagent of the Santa Fe railroad, with headquarters at San Francisco; Otho\r\nOno, a graduate of the Atchison county high school, taught school for\r\nten years, served as county superintendent of Atchison county four\r\nyears, and graduated from the Atchison Business College, and is at\r\npresent bookkeeper for Urich’s planing mill at Independence, Kan.; Wiley\r\nWyatt died in infancy; Clara Charlotte, deceased, formerly a teacher,\r\nwife of Charles Sprong, of Potter, Kan.; Edith Eliza, deceased, who was\r\nalso a public school teacher; Milo Milton, a journalist and author, of\r\nNew York City. Milo graduated from the Atchison county high school, the\r\nState Agricultural College at Manhattan, and pursued a post-graduate\r\ncourse in the State university. The mother of these children was born\r\nAugust 5, 1844, in Sandusky Plain, Ohio, a daughter of the Rev. Pardee\r\nButler, a famous figure in Kansas history, and who was an outspoken\r\nadvocate of the anti-slavery principles during the struggle which made\r\nKansas a free State. He was so frank and fearless in the expression of\r\nhis views and so strenuous in the support of the anti-slavery doctrine\r\nthat his utterances brought him frequently in contact with the pro-\r\nslavery men and border ruffians, and on one occasion when in Atchison he\r\nwas captured by ruffians and sent down the Missouri river on a raft.\r\nComplete details of the life and activities of Pardee Butler are given\r\nin another chapter in this volume. “Pardee Butler’s Own Book,” begun\r\nduring the latter part of his life, and finished and published by Mrs.\r\nHastings, tells of his life and adventures in Kansas. Speaking\r\nbiographically, Mr. Butler was born March 9, 1816, and died October 20,\r\n1888. He first saw the light of day at Skaneateles, N. Y., and\r\nimmigrated with his parents, Phineas Butler and wife, who came to Ohio\r\nin 1818. Phineas Butler was born in New York State. Pardee Butler was\r\nreared to young manhood in Ohio and there married Sybil Carlton, of\r\nSullivan, Ohio, who was born July 4, 1823, and died August 7, 1898. She\r\nwas a daughter of Joseph Carlton, a native of Massachusetts, who\r\nimmigrated to Ohio in an early day. In his boyhood, Pardee herded sheep\r\non Sandusky Plain, and after his father’s death resided in Sullivan,\r\nOhio. In 1850 he removed to Iowa and settled on a farm in Cedar county,\r\nwhere he lived for five years. While a resident of Iowa he preached in\r\nIllinois for two years. In May of 1855 he set out for Atchison county,\r\nKansas, on horseback and settled on a farm at Farmington. For many years\r\nhe served as a Christian minister and conducted farming operations. He\r\nhad a remarkably retentive memory, which enabled him to memorize the\r\nwhole of the New Testament while herding sheep in Ohio. Rev. Butler was\r\nthe first State evangelist of the Christian denomination to visit Iowa\r\nand was also the first State evangelist to take up the work of his\r\nchurch in Kansas. Practically all of his traveling while engaged in\r\nmissionary work was accomplished on horseback. Night coming on he would\r\npicket his horse in a grassy spot and use his saddle for a pillow.\r\nPardee Butler was one of the notable figures in the history of Kansas,\r\nand will be remembered as long as history endures, as a brave, useful\r\nand faithful patriot, and minister, whose life was full of good deeds\r\nand who always stood for the right. He was the father of seven children:\r\nMrs. Rosetta Hastings, Clara Louise, Eugene Pardee, Maria Corintha, all\r\nof whom died in infancy; Charles Pardee on the home farm; Ernest, died\r\nin infancy; George, living at White City, Kan.\r\n\r\nRev. Hastings has always been a steadfast advocate of prohibition, but\r\nhas generally allied himself politically with the Republican party\r\nprinciples. In 1876 he was selected by the Republican party in the\r\ncounty as their candidate for the legislature, although at the time he\r\nwas an avowed Prohibitionist, and was elected, serving in the Kansas\r\nlegislature during the ensuing session. For eighteen years he served as\r\na member of the school board in his home district, and was for six years\r\na member of the Atchison County High School Board. He believes in\r\neducation for the young to the fullest and is heart and soul in favor of\r\ngiving young men and women every opportunity to acquire a higher\r\neducation, as is attested by the splendid training which he was enabled\r\nto give each of his own offspring. Rev. Hastings has baptized hundreds\r\nof converts during his ministerial career and started them onward in the\r\nbetter life. His whole life has been dedicated for good.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            KNUD G. GIGSTAD.\r\n\r\nKnud G. Gigstad, farmer and breeder of fine cattle, was born in Norway\r\nSeptember 28, 1856, and is a son of Gulick and Anna Gigstad. He was one\r\nof seven children one of whom is now dead. Four of the boys and one\r\ndaughter are living in the United States. The father was a native of\r\nNorway and spent his life in that country.\r\n\r\nKnud G. Gigstad left Norway at the age of twenty to try his luck in\r\nAmerica. He came without funds and went to work as a farm hand in Brown\r\ncounty, Kansas. He remained at that place two years and then rented 160\r\nacres from his uncle, Benedict Mutson. This was a profitable venture and\r\nbefore long he was able to buy eighty acres of unimproved land in\r\nsection 28, Lancaster township, Atchison county, for which he paid\r\n$16.25 an acre. Mr. Gigstad worked hard to get his farm in workable\r\nshape, each year finding him a little more prosperous, and finally he\r\nadded 320 acres to the farm, besides 436 acres of rice land in Liberty\r\ncounty, near Houston, Texas. Eighteen years ago he built a large house\r\non the farm and has since erected a large barn and other substantial\r\nbuildings. Mr. Gigstad is a breeder of Shorthorn cattle and has made\r\nexhibits at the American Royal stock show in Kansas City, Mo., and in\r\n1913 was awarded the prize as grand champion of America on his\r\nShorthorns. This is a high honor and is ample testimony of the quality\r\nof Mr. Gigstad’s stock. He is an extensive shipper to all parts of the\r\nUnited States. His reputation as a breeder is firmly established among\r\ncattle men all over the country. He is almost sure of one or two first\r\nprizes whenever he enters his cattle in a fair. Mr. Gigstad also has a\r\nfine three acre orchard. He is a hard working man and has succeeded\r\ndespite great handicaps, and his financial success has not caused him to\r\nneglect the welfare of his county, as he has always been active in\r\nsupporting measures for the good of Atchison county.\r\n\r\nHe is married to Lena Olsen, a native of Atchison county, and a daughter\r\nof Herrol and Julia Olsen. She was born in 1866. Her parents are natives\r\nof Norway and her father was an early settler of Atchison county. Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Gigstad have eleven children: Anna Flattre, of Lancaster\r\ntownship; Mrs. Julia Henz, of Lancaster, Kan.; Harry, Clara, Gena,\r\nGilbert, Matilda, Lillian, Gladis, Carl, Charles, all living at home.\r\nMr. Gigstad is a Republican and a member of the Lutheran church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ALBERT BARNES HARVEY.\r\n\r\nThe memory of a good and noble man lingers long after his demise in the\r\nhearts and minds of those who knew him best. The late Albert Barnes\r\nHarvey, of Muscotah, Kan., during the course of a long and notable\r\ncareer, covering ever forty years in Atchison county, accomplished much\r\nin a material sense and left behind him an unimpeachable record for\r\nintegrity and upright living which will long endear his memory to his\r\nformer mortal associates. He lived in the days when men were more\r\nclosely drawn together in the great struggle to create a State from a\r\nwilderness of prairie and unpeopled waste, and did his part in the\r\ndevelopment of his adopted county, of which he was one of the real\r\npioneers. Soldier, farmer, banker and religious worker who lived true to\r\nhis ideals as a man and citizen, he walked with the leaders of the great\r\nState which he assisted in upbuilding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Eng. by E. G. Williams & Bro. N. Y._\r\n\r\n  _A. B. Harvey_\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlbert Barnes Harvey was born May 12, 1841, at Williamsport, Pa., a son\r\nof Samuel and Margaret Harvey. His parents went from their native State\r\nto Illinois in the early days of the settlement of that State,\r\ndeveloping a fine farm in Henderson county, Illinois. Samuel Harvey\r\nprospered in the State of his adoption, reared a fine family, and in his\r\nlater days retired to a comfortable home in Monmouth, Ill., removing to\r\nthe city for the purpose primarily, of giving his children the\r\nadvantages afforded there for obtaining a good school education. He died\r\nat the home of his son in Henderson county after a long and useful life.\r\nThe subject of this review, Albert Barnes, when a young man twenty years\r\nof age, hearkened to the first call of President Lincoln for troops with\r\nwhich to quell the rebellion of the Southern States and enlisted in\r\nCompany G, Tenth infantry, regiment of Illinois volunteers, and served\r\nfaithfully throughout the Civil war. He was engaged with his regiment in\r\nmany great battles, such as Corinth, Island Number Ten, Missionary\r\nRidge, Lookout Mountain, Chickamauga, Siege of Vicksburg, and Capture of\r\nAtlanta, and took part in Sherman’s famous march from Atlanta to the sea\r\nand the subsequent taking of Savannah. He marched in the Grand Review at\r\nWashington, D. C., and was mustered out of the service July 12, 1865. He\r\nthen returned home and engaged in the peaceful pursuit of farming until\r\n1874, when he came to Kansas and settled on a farm southwest of\r\nMuscotah. This farm was only partially improved at the time of his\r\npurchase and he improved and cultivated it until 1880, at which time he\r\ncame to Muscotah and engaged in the hardware business in partnership\r\nwith A. J. Harwi; later he was in partnership with F. S. Roberts, who\r\nwas succeeded by W. C. Allison. In 1890 he became associated with J. H.\r\nCalvert in the banking business at Muscotah, he and his partner\r\npurchasing the bank founded by George Storch and changing the name to\r\nthe Muscotah Exchange Bank. This bank was later changed to the Muscotah\r\nState Bank and is one of the thriving financial concerns of Atchison\r\ncounty, now incorporated with the Farmers State Bank. Mr. Harvey was in\r\nthe banking business for twenty years and served as president of the\r\nMuscotah State Bank, and was successful in his business ventures to such\r\nan extent that he became one of the wealthy citizens of the county.\r\nDuring his later years he and Mrs. Harvey enjoyed traveling about the\r\ncountry, the condition of his health becoming such that it was\r\npractically necessary for him to spend his winters in the Southland. He\r\nand Mrs. Harvey spent many happy days in visiting the battlefields of\r\nthe South over which his regiment had fought and they enjoyed life to\r\nthe utmost during those later years.\r\n\r\nMr. Harvey was married October 25, 1871, at Stronghurst, Ill., to Miss\r\nViola Allison, who was born October 25, 1841, in Washington county,\r\nPennsylvania, a daughter of John and Margaret (Carter) Allison. John\r\nAllison was born in Pennsylvania and was a second cousin of President\r\nWilliam McKinley, whose mother was an Allison. Margaret Carter Allison\r\nwas born in Scotland and accompanied her parents to this country when\r\ntwelve years of age, where they settled in Henderson county, Illinois.\r\nBoth of Mrs. Harvey’s parents died in Illinois, and a brother, John C,\r\nwho enlisted in the Union army at the age of seventeen years, died at\r\nFt. Donelson. An older brother, Hugh, also served in the Union army, and\r\na half brother, W. C. Allison, now of Horton, resided in Muscotah for\r\nmany years and was one of the pioneer business men of the city. The\r\nAllison family is a very old and numerous one of Scotch descent. No\r\nchildren came to bless this happy wedded life of Albert H. and Viola\r\nHarvey, but they reared two adopted daughters, who are now established\r\nin comfortable homes of their own, namely: Lela, wife of A. P. Bishop,\r\nof Topeka, now a farmer living southwest of Muscotah, and Lula, wife of\r\nE. H. Purdy, of Kansas City, Mo. Mrs. Bishop has four children: Albert,\r\nGeorge, Dorothy and Ruth. Mrs. Harvey spends the spring and summer\r\nseasons in her beautiful residence in Muscotah and invariably travels in\r\nthe South during the winter. Mr. Harvey retired from active banking\r\npursuits in 1910.\r\n\r\nMr. Harvey was a member of the Congregational church at Muscotah and\r\nserved as deacon of the church from 1898 until his demise, on Monday,\r\nJuly 22, 1912. For many years he was superintendent of the Sunday school\r\nand was very fond of young people, nothing giving him more pleasure than\r\nto gather about him a group of intelligent young folks with whom he was\r\nalways at his best. He took a keen interest in church and Sunday school\r\nwork and endeavored to follow the precepts of the Greatest of All\r\nTeachers during all the days of his long and useful life. He was\r\nprominent in Masonic and Odd Fellows lodge circles and served as\r\nworshipful master of the Muscotah Masons on two occasions. He was a\r\nmember of the Grand Army of the Republic. He was a Republican in\r\npolitics and took a keen interest in the political and civic affairs of\r\nAtchison county, serving three terms as a member of the Atchison County\r\nHigh School board and a term as mayor of his home city. Many of the\r\ndistinguished men of Atchison and the State of Kansas were his personal\r\nfriends, among them being the late Governor George W. Glick, with whom\r\nhe spent a winter in Florida, Ex-Governor W. J. Bailey, and the late\r\nJudge Horace M. Jackson, of Atchison. He was, withal, a home and church\r\nman above everything else. He loved his home and his family and was\r\nhospitable to the core of his being, always ready to entertain friends\r\nor even strangers at his board, jolly and big-hearted, always.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MARTIN KLEIN.\r\n\r\nMartin Klein, living a retired life in the town of Potter, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, at the advanced age of four score and two years, is one\r\nof the oldest of the Kansas pioneers, who for over sixty-one years of\r\nhis long life has lived in the Sunflower State, and has seen the steam\r\nrailway take the place of the overland freight trains, hauled by oxen\r\nand mules, and has witnessed the automobile superseding the farm wagon\r\nand horse and buggy as a means of transportation. On his lonely claim in\r\nthe north part of Leavenworth county, near Potter, he could see the\r\ngreat trains passing along the Ft. Riley road from Leavenworth to Salt\r\nLake; he remembers the dread visitation of the grasshoppers in the\r\nseventies, when the “hoppers” came in dense clouds, ate up all the\r\ngrowing crops and left devastation and desolation in their wake. Martin\r\nKlein is one of the best known of the old-timers in this section of\r\nKansas and took an active part in the slavery contest which was bitterly\r\nwaged on Kansas soil, and nearly gave his life in defense of his\r\nprinciples, later to shoulder a musket in defence of his adopted\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMartin Klein was born March 2, 1833, in Alsace-Lorraine, a son of Peter\r\nand Teresa (Miers) Klein, both of whom were born and reared in Alsace-\r\nLorraine, and were of ancient French extraction. When Martin was\r\nfourteen years of age, his parents in 1847, left their native land and\r\nimmigrated to Oneida county, New York, where they settled on a farm near\r\nRome. The elder Klein prospered in the land of his adoption and Martin\r\ngrew up imbued with American ideals, along with the other five children\r\nof the Klein family. Martin was the youngest of a family of six children\r\nborn to Peter and Teresa Klein. Three brothers of Mrs. Klein, Joseph\r\nMiers, and two others, were soldiers, who served under Napoleon\r\nBonaparte, and were members of the Grand Army of Napoleon which marched\r\nto the siege of Moscow. Two of the brothers were killed at Moscow, and\r\nJoseph was one of the few out of the many thousands of soldiers who\r\nlived to return home and tell about the ill-fated expedition which cost\r\nNapoleon his grand army.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1854, Martin Klein left his old home in New York and set\r\nout for Kansas, to grow up with the country. He arrived in Leavenworth\r\non September 18 of that year, and lost no time in taking up a claim in\r\nLeavenworth county, which served as his home until 1900, when he retired\r\nto a comfortable home in the town of Potter. Six years after his arrival\r\nin Kansas he married Miss Paulina Hawley, whom he espoused on March 29,\r\n1860. She was a daughter of Francis H. and Louise Hawley, both of whom\r\nwere natives of old Virginia, and were early settlers in Kentucky, where\r\nMrs. Klein was born November 12, 1826. She departed this life January 4,\r\n1907, in Potter, Kan. She was a loving and faithful helpmeet to Mr.\r\nKlein for forty-seven years, and endured with him many hardships\r\nincident to the pioneer life in Kansas.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Klein first came to Kansas in 1854, the turmoil and the border\r\nwarfare waged between the pro- and anti-slavery forces, was just\r\nbeginning, and he, being a pronounced anti-slavery man, was thrown into\r\nthe thick of the fight. He was an accurate marksman with the revolver,\r\nand often found occasion to make use of his ability with the pistol. He\r\nwas so active in his work in behalf of the Free State party that he was\r\nmarked for vengeance by border ruffians. An occasion which is memorable,\r\nand marked the savagery of this warfare, is worth recording: “On a\r\nSunday in the spring of 1856, when Mr. Klein was at church, three\r\nstrangers came to church, ostensibly to buy corn from him. After the\r\nbargain had been struck, and he had agreed to sell the men the corn\r\nwanted, they insisted on him accompanying them to Easton, Kan., in order\r\nto get his pay for the corn. This Klein refused to do. During the parley\r\none of the men had kept a hand hid under his coat on the plea that he\r\nhad a sore member. The wind blowing the coat flap to one side, Klein\r\nnoticed that the man was concealing a revolver in his hand. They finally\r\nshowed him a warrant for his arrest. He then knew that his life was in\r\ndanger, and again refused to accompany the men to Easton. He turned to\r\ngo back to the church and they opened fire on him, firing eight shots in\r\nall, four of which took effect in his body, one shot striking him in the\r\nhead, one in the side, and one in the hip. He fell to the ground and the\r\nruffians rode away, leaving him for dead. Happily, the wounds were not\r\nfatal, and he recovered, and lived to see the final triumph of the cause\r\nwhich he loved, and for which he had sacrificed his peace and nearly\r\nlost his life in advocating. During those early days Mr. Klein served as\r\nconstable and deputy sheriff and was constantly in danger of his life.\r\nIn the fall of 1856, he and others of the Free State men deemed it\r\nprudent to leave their homes and go to Lawrence, Kan., where they joined\r\nthe citizen army, which was being organized in defense of Free State\r\nprinciples. He took part in several incipient battles and scraps with\r\nthe pro-slavery advocates during those years, and when the war broke out\r\nhe enrolled in the Kansas militia and fought in Captain Baird’s company\r\nwhen it marched to battle against General Price’s army of invasion.\r\n\r\nMr. Klein has a keen remembrance of his first day in Kansas, when he\r\nwalked a distance of twenty-four miles from Ft. Leavenworth to find his\r\nbrother-in-law, Charles C. Foster. He was all day finding Foster’s\r\nclaim. Starting out without his breakfast, he lost his way, and it was 8\r\no’clock that night before he arrived at his destination, footsore, weary\r\nand hungry. The prairie grass in those days grew as high as a man’s head\r\nin the bottom lands, and was knee high on the uplands, and the richness\r\nof the soil was apparent to a man brought up on a farm. From his cabin\r\ndoor Mr. Klein could look out in the distance and see the old Ft. Riley\r\ntrail which led from Ft. Leavenworth to Salt Lake. One morning on\r\narising he saw eighty covered wagons standing on the trail, each of\r\nwhich had hitched to it six yoke of oxen. This was a sight worth seeing\r\nand entertaining to a plainsman, being an indication of the onward march\r\nof civilization as it moved ever westward. On one occasion while serving\r\nas an officer of the law, Mr. Klein was sent to the cabin of Jim Foster,\r\na noted border desperado, to effect his arrest, but Foster was absent at\r\nthe time from his home on the bluffs overlooking Big Stranger creek.\r\nAfter the war was over, Mr. Klein settled down to farming and peacefully\r\ntilled his acres until his retirement to Potter. He took an active and\r\ninfluential part in the affairs of his community, and has always been\r\nallied with the Republican party, never, however, having been a seeker\r\nafter political preferment, and never held office except the post of\r\nschool director in his district.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BARNEY CUMMINS.\r\n\r\nBarney Cummins, farmer and trustee of Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison\r\ncounty, was born in Atchison December 17, 1859, a son of Patrick and\r\nMary (Faulkner) Cummins, the former a native of Roscommon county, and\r\nthe latter a native of County Caven, Ireland. Both came to America from\r\ntheir native land when young, and met, and were married in Philadelphia.\r\nAfter their marriage they went to Wisconsin and lived there one year and\r\nthen came to Atchison, Kan. Patrick was employed on a Missouri river\r\nsteamboat for a time, saved his money and moved to a farm, which he\r\nrented for about ten years, accumulating sufficient capital to then\r\npurchase a quarter section of school land in Mt. Pleasant township, the\r\ntract now known as the old Cummins homestead. Patrick Cummins succeeded\r\nin his farming venture and became prosperous as the years passed. During\r\nthe Civil war he was enrolled as a member of the Kansas State militia.\r\nHe was known as a Free State Democrat, and was a member of the Catholic\r\nchurch. He died in 1871, and the widowed mother of Barney Cummins is\r\nstill living at the age of seventy-six years, on the old home farm.\r\nThere were six children in the Cummins family, namely: Barney; Charles,\r\non the home place; John, a farmer in Atchison county; Kathrine, living\r\nwith her mother; Mary, wife of William Rogers, of Nortonville, Kan.;\r\nSophia, wife of Thomas Cavanaugh, of St. Joseph, Mo.\r\n\r\nBarney was about four years of age when the family removed from Atchison\r\nto the farm in Mt. Pleasant township. He received his education in the\r\ndistrict school, near his home, and has lived on the farm all of his\r\nlife, excepting one year spent in Atchison. Mr. Cummins recollects with\r\nsadness the severity of the early-day teachers as compared with the\r\nteachers of today. He recalls that he was frequently given his choice of\r\npunishments, which included either having his ears cut off, or take a\r\nsound whipping with a great gad. This badly frightened him, and he also\r\nremembers how the teacher jerked a big boy from his seat and threw him\r\nunconscious to the floor of the school room. Happily, the days of brute\r\nstrength control of pupils in the schools is past, and a new and better\r\nera of kindness and forbearance has dawned, years since. Mr. Cummins is\r\nthe owner of 100 acres of well improved land and is a progressive\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nHe was married January 9, 1882, to Sarah Maylen, a daughter of Joseph\r\nand Elizabeth Maylen. The father was a native of Canada, and the mother\r\nwas born in Liverpool, England, their children being a product of the\r\nintermarriage of French, English and Welsh ancestry. Joseph Maylen was a\r\nFrench Canadian and his wife was of Welsh and English descent. They came\r\nto Kansas in the early days and settled on a farm in Doniphan county.\r\nFour children have been born to Mr. and Mrs. Cummins: William, living at\r\nPotter, Kan.; Ella, wife of Luther Blodgett, a farmer in Atchison\r\ncounty; Anna, wife of Harry Linsey, living in Atchison county; Joseph,\r\nat home with his parents. Mr. and Mrs. Cummins have reared all of their\r\nchildren on the farm upon which they have lived continuously since their\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nMr. Cummins is affiliated with the Modern Woodmen lodge of Potter, and\r\nis a member of the Catholic church. He is a Democrat of the old school,\r\nand since attaining his majority he has taken a more or less active part\r\nin political affairs. He has served several terms as trustee of Mt.\r\nPleasant township, and it can be said of him that no man ever filled the\r\noffice more capably or administered the affairs of the township to\r\nbetter advantage or more economically and honestly than Barney Cummins.\r\nHe was first elected to the office in 1892, again in 1907, then in 1908\r\nand again in 1912, being re-elected in 1914. As trustee, Mr. Cummins has\r\nthe supervision of eight schools in his township, including the graded\r\nhigh school of Potter. He is a faithful and conscientious public\r\nofficial in whom the people impose every trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ALVA CLAPP.\r\n\r\nAlva Clapp, president of the retail hardware company which bears his\r\nname, has been engaged in business on Commercial street in Atchison\r\nsince May, 1907. At that time he purchased the retail store of a local\r\nwholesale firm, and has made a pronounced success of the venture. It is\r\none of the most attractive and well stocked stores of the city and is\r\nwell patronized. Mr. Clapp is popular with his patrons and the citizens\r\nof Atchison generally. He takes an active part in city affairs and is\r\nespecially interested in the public school system. Having been a teacher\r\nbefore he became a merchant, he has never lost interest in the schools,\r\nand is now the president of the Atchison city board of education.\r\n\r\nMr. Clapp was born August 23, 1868, at Carthage, Mo. He is a son of\r\nIsaac and Susan B. (Eckler) Clapp, natives of North Carolina and\r\nIllinois, respectively. Isaac Clapp emigrated from North Carolina to\r\nDanville, Ill., when a young man, and married in his adopted State. His\r\nparents were slave owners in the southland, and he himself owned slaves,\r\nbut having a pronounced distaste for the institution of slavery he\r\ndisposed of his human chattels and moved to the North. After a residence\r\nof some years in Illinois, he located in Carthage, Mo., and owned a farm\r\nin Jasper county which he cultivated. In 1875 he removed to Cherryvale,\r\nKan., and invested in a tract of land near that city. Here he resided\r\nuntil his death in October, 1913.\r\n\r\nAlva Clapp received his education in the schools of Cherryvale, Kan.,\r\nand began teaching school when a very young man. He taught two terms in\r\na district school and served for two years as high school principal. He\r\nhad a liking for business and obtained his first experience in the\r\nretail hardware trade in a store at Conway Springs, Kan., from 1891 to\r\n1900, or a period of ten years. He then traveled for two years in the\r\ninterest of a local wholesale hardware company and was then employed for\r\nfive years in the various departments of the local concern. In 1907 he\r\norganized the Alva Clapp Hardware Company and purchased the retail\r\ndepartment of the Blish, Mize & Silliaman Company of Atchison. Mr. Clapp\r\nhas given evidence of a pronounced aptitude for business affairs, and\r\nfaithfully attends to the numerous details which require the undivided\r\nattention of the proprietor of a thriving concern, such as is in his\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nHe was married in September of 1896 to Beatrice Kathrine De Haven, of\r\nWichita, Kan. They had one child, Harold De Haven, who died at the age\r\nof one and one-half years. Mr. Clapp refers to Mrs. Clapp as his partner\r\nin the business and his best and most competent assistant. Mrs. Clapp is\r\nnot only a good wife and socially active in the city, but she takes a\r\njust pride in assisting her husband in making a success of his business.\r\nMr. Clapp is politically allied with the Republican party and has served\r\nfor fourteen years as a member of the school board. During his period of\r\nservice as a member of the board the school system of Atchison has made\r\nits greatest advances, and the high school has achieved considerable\r\nprestige. New buildings have been erected to accommodate the growing\r\nneeds of the school system, and others are in course of erection. All of\r\nthese improvements have received the hearty support of Mr. Clapp and he\r\nenjoys the respect and esteem of his brother members to such an extent\r\nthat when the presidency of the board became vacant he was elected to\r\nthe position. He was also recently elected treasurer of the Commercial\r\nClub of Atchison, another city boosting organization in which he is a\r\nprominent figure. Mr. Clapp is affiliated with the Modern Woodmen and\r\nthe Elks lodges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HON. GEORGE STORCH.\r\n\r\nOne of the notable and influential figures of the first and second\r\ndecades in the history of Atchison county was the late George Storch, of\r\nAtchison. He came to Kansas when the State was in its infancy of\r\ndevelopment and was a pioneer merchant of old Kennekuk, becoming in turn\r\na merchant, banker, statesman, and was, withal, one of the most useful\r\ncitizens of Atchison county of whom the reviewer has had opportunity to\r\nwrite. Mr. Storch was a pioneer with a vision which enabled him to see\r\nfar ahead into the future. This vision, coupled with faith in the\r\neventual prosperity of Kansas, led him to invest heavily in farm lands\r\nwhich made him one of the wealthy citizens of Kansas prior to his\r\ndemise. For nearly half a century, Mr. Storch was closely identified\r\nwith the financial and civic life of Atchison county, and twice\r\nrepresented the county in the halls of the State legislature, each time\r\nacquitting himself with credit and honor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Geo Storch_\r\n]\r\n\r\nGeorge Storch was born near Poppen-Hausen, Bavaria, Germany, February\r\n22, 1835, and was a son of Thomas and Margaret (Breitung) Storch.\r\nThomas, the father, was a farmer and linen dealer in his native locality\r\nand was considered fairly well to do. George was reared to young manhood\r\nin his native land and received a good common school education. When\r\nseventeen years of age he determined to cross the seas and seek his\r\nfortune in America. In accordance with this determination he embarked on\r\na sailing vessel which landed him at New Orleans. From this southern\r\ncity he made his way by river steamer up the Mississippi and Missouri\r\nrivers to Herman, Mo. Here he joined a brother who was farming in the\r\nneighborhood and who assisted George in securing employment on a nearby\r\nfarm. He worked at farm labor in Missouri for some years and in April,\r\n1859, he came to Atchison, Kan. This city did not offer much inducement\r\nfor the ambitious young man and he was desirous of engaging in the\r\nmercantile business. Kennekuk, in the north central part of the county,\r\nwas then in the heyday of its prosperity and seemed to offer a better\r\nlocation than Atchison. After a few months’ stay in Atchison he went to\r\nKennekuk and opened a general merchandise store with the capital which\r\nhe had saved while working on the farms in Missouri. He was successful\r\nfrom the start and his judgment in the matter of Kennekuk being an\r\nexcellent business location proved correct. Kennekuk was at that time a\r\nprosperous and thriving village located on the overland mail and\r\nemigrant route and the Storch store made money for its owner to such an\r\nextent that he was enabled to branch out and invest in lands and engage\r\nin the banking business. Mr. Storch justified his faith in his adopted\r\nState by investing heavily in lands which have greatly increased in\r\nvalue since his original purchase of the same. In the early days of the\r\ndevelopment of the West, the railroad companies were granted large\r\ntracts of farm lands along the right of way by the Federal Government.\r\nThese tracts were placed on sale by the railroads, and were sold for\r\nvery low prices and easy terms in order to induce settlers to locate in\r\nthe regions being developed. Mr. Storch took advantage of the low prices\r\nof the farm lands and invested heavily. This property comprised many\r\nthousands of acres which have since increased enormously in value over\r\nand above the original purchase price. Kennekuk had its day, and the\r\ntime came when the decline of the village was inevitable owing to the\r\nbuilding of the Central Branch railway out of Atchison, and which passed\r\nto the southward of Kennekuk. Mr. Storch saw the time coming when the\r\nonce flourishing inland village would be no more, and in 1867 he removed\r\nto Atchison and managed his large farming interests from this city.\r\n\r\nUpon his removal to Atchison he immediately became identified with the\r\nleading financial interests of the city and in 1873 organized the German\r\nSavings Bank which was for many years one of the strong financial\r\ninstitutions of the city. He was also identified with the first bank\r\nestablished in Muscotah, Kan. He engaged in the real estate and farm\r\nloan business in Atchison and organized the Eastern Kansas Land and Loan\r\nCompany, a concern which is still doing business and of which his\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Louisa J. Lips, is president. Mr. Storch served as\r\npresident of the German Savings Bank until its stock was purchased by\r\nthe United States National Bank, and also filled the office of president\r\nof this bank during the period of its existence. He was engaged in\r\nbanking pursuits for a period of eighteen years.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1859 to Miss Elizabeth Fox, a daughter of John and\r\nElizabeth Fox, who removed from Evansville, Ind., where Mrs. Storch was\r\nborn, to Carroll county, Missouri, and settled on a farm. Two children\r\nblessed this union of George and Elizabeth Storch: George H., who will\r\nbe remembered as a bright, intelligent and capable Atchison citizen and\r\nwho was associated with his father in business for several years, and\r\ndied in July, 1911, and Louisa Justina, widow of Oscar Lips. Mrs. Storch\r\ndied in February, 1905, and almost three years later followed the demise\r\nof the husband and father, who departed this life in January, 1908.\r\nOscar Lips and Louisa Justina Storch were married in 1891, and that\r\nunion was blessed with a son, Charles, born in October, 1896. Charles\r\nLips received his primary education in the public schools of Atchison,\r\nhis preparatory work in the Culver, Ind., Military Academy, and is now\r\npursuing a collegiate course in the Kansas University at Lawrence. Oscar\r\nLips was born in St. Louis, Mo., a son of Dr. Charles August Lips, a\r\nformer practicing physician of St. Louis, and who was of German descent.\r\nOscar was reared and educated in his native city, and when a young man\r\nengaged in the wholesale drug business. His demise occurred in Atchison,\r\nAugust, 1905.\r\n\r\nGeorge Storch was a Republican in politics and took an active and\r\ninfluential part in political affairs during his long years of residence\r\nin Kansas. Not long after establishing himself in business at Kennekuk\r\nhe became postmaster of the town, and assisted in establishing the first\r\nunion school in the village, serving as a member of the board of\r\neducation which had charge of this school. The _Horton Headlight_ has\r\nthe following historical account of this school in an issue of August,\r\n1905, in part: “The old stone school house was not the first school\r\nbuilding in the Kennekuk neighborhood, but it was the first substantial\r\none in this part of the country and marks an important epoch in its\r\ndevelopment. It was built in 1867. It was a joint district, eight miles\r\nnorth and south. The west line was the road between Atchison and Jackson\r\ncounties. A strip of country two miles wide and eight miles long was in\r\nAtchison county and a corresponding trip of country was just over the\r\nline in Brown county. The school house was quite a structure to be\r\nbuilded in that early day, but the settlers did not complain at the high\r\ntaxes, since their children had a good place to attend school. The cost\r\nwas about $3,000, quite a good sized sum for early settlers to expend,\r\nbut it shows their determination to provide an education for their\r\nchildren. The first school board was composed of George Storch, Squire\r\nWillis and Henry Claunch....”\r\n\r\nMr. Storch was always greatly interested in the cause of education and\r\nafter his removal to Atchison he served as a member of the Atchison\r\nboard of education and was president of this body for a time. While a\r\nresident of Kennekuk he was elected to represent Atchison county in the\r\nKansas legislature in 1864. During the ensuing session he voted for Gen.\r\nJames H. Lane for United States senator and voted to ratify the\r\nfourteenth amendment to the National constitution. In 1876 he was\r\nelected a member of the legislature from the city of Atchison, and\r\nduring the session following his election he was a member of the ways\r\nand means committee and voted for P. B. Plumb for United States senator.\r\nMr. Storch made an excellent record as an able and honest legislator,\r\nwho had the best interests of his State at heart. He was active in civic\r\nand political affairs in Atchison and served as a member of the city\r\ncouncil of which body he was president for one year, declining re-\r\nelection when his term of office expired. The following tribute to his\r\nability as a city father appeared in the _Atchison Champion_ of April 6,\r\n1873: “One of the best councilmen our city has ever had leaves that body\r\nafter two years’ service in it. We refer to Hon. George Storch, chairman\r\nof the committee on improvements. He has been industrious, independent,\r\nand energetic. Having the chairmanship of the most important and\r\nlaborious committee, he has given his time and attention to the\r\ndischarge of the duties devolving upon him, and in the decision of all\r\nquestions in the council he has exhibited a clearness of judgment and a\r\ncarefulness in guarding the interests of the city that entitle him to\r\ngeneral commendation. He declined re-election.”\r\n\r\nMr. Storch served for three years as city treasurer and exhibited the\r\nsame judgment and careful management of the city’s affairs in this\r\nimportant capacity that has marked the performance of his official\r\nduties as a councilman and school trustee. It is worthy of record that\r\nin 1865, while in Kennekuk, he was elected a member of the board of\r\ncounty commissioners and served as chairman of that body.\r\n\r\nFew pioneer citizens of Atchison lived a more useful or busier life than\r\nhe of whom this review is written. The name of George Storch figures\r\nprominently in the historical annals of Atchison county as a builder and\r\ncreator and an honorable and upright citizen, who left behind him when\r\nhis soul winged its way beyond the knowledge of mortal ken, a record\r\nimperishable, and a name unblemished and untarnished of which his\r\ndescendants may well be proud. While opportunities for achieving fortune\r\nand fame may not be as great at this day as they were in George Storch’s\r\ntime and era, the story of this poor German emigrant boy who made his\r\nown way in Kansas from poverty to affluence and won an honored place in\r\nthe history of his adopted county and State is well worth reading and\r\nmay serve as an inspiration and guidance to others of the present and\r\nrising generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THOMAS BROWN.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable satisfaction in writing the life story of a man\r\nwho has worked his way upward from poverty to a position of wealth and\r\ninfluence in the space of a lifetime, and accomplished it all with his\r\nown strong arms and mind. When one adds to this accomplishment the\r\nrearing of a large family to lives of usefulness, and to bring up a bevy\r\nof young men and women to comfort their parents in their declining\r\nyears, there is not much for any one individual to wish for. Thomas\r\nBrown, retired farmer, of Effingham, Kan., has done all of this and is\r\nthe proud father of one of the largest families in Atchison county. Had\r\nhe done no more than to bring into the world his thirteen children, he\r\nwould have been worthy of praise and been entitled to honorable mention\r\nin this volume, as a patriotic and sturdy American citizen. A native of\r\nthe Emerald isle, he came to America in his youth, and now ranks as one\r\nof the Kansas and Atchison county pioneers.\r\n\r\nThomas Brown was born in the little village of Altone, Ireland, and is a\r\nson of John and Mary (Dalton) Brown. His birth occurred on February 10,\r\n1847. His father was a farmer in his native country, and made a good\r\nliving for his family, later moving to the town of Altone and engaging\r\nin the transfer business, in which occupation he was fairly successful\r\nand enabled to provide for his family in comfort. He was the father of\r\nten children, seven of whom came to America to seek their fortunes in\r\nthe land of opportunity. The seven who came across the Ocean were: J. P.\r\nBrown, a pioneer merchant and capitalist, of Atchison, now deceased;\r\nMrs. Bridget Norton, who died in 1913 at her home in Pittsfield, Mass.;\r\nMrs. Mary Scully, of Troy, N. Y.; Mrs. Anna Elkhorn, of Troy, N. Y.;\r\nMrs. Margaret Hewitt, of Independence, Mo.; Mrs. Kate Waters, deceased,\r\nwho was the wife of a soldier in the British army. The father of these\r\nchildren died in Ireland, and the mother died in Troy, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThomas Brown emigrated from his native land to this country in 1865, and\r\nhired out to a farmer in Orange county, New York, at $20 per month. The\r\nfarm where he was employed was located seventeen miles north of Newburg,\r\non the Hudson river. He worked there for two years and carefully saved\r\nhis earnings until he had $300. With this capital he set out for the\r\nWest and joined his brother, J. P. Brown, who was then located in\r\nAtchison. His first employment was on his brother’s stock farm, located\r\nnorth of Monrovia. Unfortunately, he was taken ill not long after his\r\narrival, and lay sick for a long time with typhoid, all of his savings\r\ngoing to pay for medical services and nursing. He remained on his\r\nbrother’s farm for ten years and laid by another stake during that time.\r\nDuring this period he cultivated three farms, owned by J. P. Brown, who\r\ndid not require him to pay any rental fees. Even the taxes were paid by\r\nhis brother who was only anxious to keep the land in cultivation and\r\ngive his brother, Tom, a start in the world. In the year 1877, Thomas,\r\nhaving saved enough money to buy a farm of his own, invested his savings\r\nin a tract of 160 acres of high prairie land, northwest of Effingham, in\r\nBenton township. His first land investment cost him $2,250. The land had\r\non it only a small shack which was soon replaced by a comfortable home.\r\nIt is now one of the best improved places in this section of Kansas, and\r\nthe Brown farms are among the most productive in the whole State of\r\nKansas. A handsome white farm house graces the home place, which can be\r\nseen for miles around, and it is quite imposing. Mr. Brown prospered as\r\nhe deserved and increased his holdings to the grand total of 640 acres\r\nof good Kansas land. The remarkable part about his purchases of land is\r\nthat he paid cash for every tract of land which he bought and never went\r\nin debt for a single acre. This land, purchased at varying prices, is\r\nnow easily worth $125 an acre. Mr. Brown carried on general farming and\r\nlive stock raising until February of 1911, when he turned over the\r\nmanagement of the home farm to his son, and removed to Effingham, where\r\nhe has a beautiful and comfortable residence in the west part of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nHe, of whom this review is written, was married on October 20, 1869, to\r\nMiss Anna Neely, born in Ohio in 1846, a daughter of Samuel Neely, who\r\nmigrated to Atchison county, Kansas, in 1868. Sixteen children have been\r\nborn of this marriage, thirteen of whom are living, all of whom are\r\nmarried excepting one daughter and a son: John, a farmer, living near\r\nBlue Rapids, Kan.; Mrs. Ida Fishburn, living on a farm near Meriden,\r\nKan.; William, Charley, Frank, and Edward, who are located on their\r\nfather’s ranch; George lives at Effingham; Richard, a successful farmer,\r\nliving south of Muscotah; Mrs. Pearl Dunn, of Oklahoma; Mrs. Ethel\r\nSmith, residing in Oklahoma; Edith, at home with her parents; Mrs. Julia\r\nWagner, living near Mortimer, Kan.; Mrs. Mary Kemp, on a farm near\r\nVermilion, Kan. This worthy couple have thirty-six grandchildren.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown is a Republican in politics, but is decidedly independent in\r\nhis voting and making up his mind concerning political questions of the\r\nday. He believes in supporting the man best qualified to serve the\r\npeople in a civic capacity, rather than blindly following the dictates\r\nof political leaders or so-called bosses, a characteristic of the man in\r\nall of his conduct through life. He is a member of the Effingham\r\nCatholic church and is a liberal supporter of this denomination, having\r\ncontributed liberally toward the building of the local church. He is a\r\nmember of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons lodge and became a member\r\nof this lodge in 1871. It is a matter of historical record that Mr.\r\nBrown, Willis Walker and Hump. Henderson, of Effingham, are the three\r\noldest living Masons in Atchison county in point of years of membership\r\nin the order. What more honor does a man wish than has befallen this\r\nAtchison county pioneer?\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ALBERT H. BLAIR.\r\n\r\nAlbert H. Blair, farmer, of Center township, Atchison county, was born\r\nMarch 6, 1862, near Astoria, Ill., and is a son of William and Alcinda\r\n(McCormack) Blair. He was one of five children, Daisy being the only\r\nother survivor. She resides in Center township and is now Mrs. Warner.\r\nTwo other children died in infancy, and William died while living on the\r\nfarm which Bert now owns. The father was born May 18, 1833, in\r\nBrownsville, Fayette county, Pennsylvania. He was a son of William\r\nBlair, and was a glass cutter while living in the East, but when he went\r\nto Illinois, he engaged in farming. Later, he farmed in Fulton county,\r\nIllinois. In 1863 he came to Kansas and engaged in freighting between\r\nAtchison and Denver, with his brother, Edward. They followed this\r\nexciting occupation about three years, and in that short time had many\r\nexperiences which they related with great delight in after years. They\r\nwere never attacked by the Indians, for the reason that they drove in\r\nlarge numbers, with 100 wagons to the train, and the Indians were shy of\r\nsuch a large force. However, one night they thought that their luck had\r\nchanged. Mr. Blair can just barely remember the incident, although his\r\nfather has told it over so many times that it seems to him as if he\r\nremembered the original incident. One night the party camped on the\r\ntrail between Atchison and Denver, lying asleep under their wagons.\r\nIndians had been seen that day and the freighting party was a little\r\nuneasy, and some of the more nervous members feared an attack. Late in\r\nthe night the mules became frightened and woke up Mr. Blair. William\r\njumped up, and off in the dark he could see a white object approaching.\r\nThe cry of “Indians” went out and rifles were aimed. William shot, but\r\ncould not hit the object. No one else could, for it was very dark and\r\nthe object could not be seen distinctly. The white object kept\r\napproaching, and finally took a definite outline in the darkness. It was\r\na white steer. One night when Indians stampeded the mules of the train,\r\nWilliam and a comrade set out in pursuit of the Indians by flaying the\r\nmules with arrows and drove them so fast that the pursuers caught up\r\nwith them by hard exertion and recaptured the horses. These are typical\r\nof many narratives which the elder Blair related of his early-day\r\nexperiences on the plains. After quitting the freighting business, he\r\nand his brother engaged in milling in Atchison, Kan. Three years later\r\nWilliam sold his interest to his brother, and started a livery business.\r\nA year later he went to farming in Doniphan county, Kansas, and moved\r\nfrom one farm to another for several years. In 1882 he was elected\r\nsheriff of Atchison county on the Democratic ticket, and his first term\r\nwas so successful that he was re-elected. After his term expired he\r\ncontinued to live in Atchison for some time. He then bought 160 acres of\r\nland in Center township and remained there until 1891, when he removed\r\nto Effingham, where he lived in retirement until his death in 1899. The\r\nmother of Bert Blair was born January 11, 1842, in Brownsville, Pa. She\r\nis a daughter of Alonza and Sarah J. (Hibbs) McCormack, who were natives\r\nof Pennsylvania. They came west in the early days and farmed in Illinois\r\nand Iowa. The mother is now living with her daughter, Mrs. Daisy Warner,\r\nin Center township, Atchison county.\r\n\r\nBert Blair grew up on his father’s farm and in Atchison, and was\r\neducated in the district schools and the Atchison public schools. He\r\nlived at home until he was eighteen years of age when he engaged in\r\nrailroading. It may have been the stories of his father about the\r\ntravelers that prompted him to go into railroading. At any rate he found\r\nthe adventurous work to his liking and he worked as a fireman on the\r\nMissouri Pacific railroad passenger train from Kansas City to Omaha,\r\nuntil he was promoted to the position of locomotive engineer. His run\r\nwas from Hiawatha to Kansas City, which was a division of the Missouri\r\nPacific then. In 1890 he rented his father’s farm, and at the death of\r\nthe latter, he inherited eighty acres, and he has since increased his\r\nholdings to 160 acres. He has built a fine modern barn on his place,\r\n50×54 feet in size, with a capacity of ninety-two tons of hay, and was\r\ndesigned and built by Mr. Blair himself.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 he married Sarah P. Jeffery, who was born February 20, 1869, in\r\nMissouri. She was a daughter of Ira P. and Mary (Farley) Jeffery, both\r\nof whom were born in Virginia. They came to Atchison county, Kansas, in\r\nthe seventies, and are now deceased. To Mr. and Mrs. Blair have been\r\nborn four children, as follows: Roberta, deceased; Claude, Effingham,\r\nKan., married Vera Pittman, of Effingham, and has one son, Thomas\r\nAlbert, who was born December 24, 1909; William C., who married Elsie\r\nStickler, of Lancaster, and has two sons, Chester Eugene, born April 23,\r\n1913, and Bert William, born October 20, 1914. A daughter, Sarah, died\r\nin infancy in Kansas City. Mrs. Blair died November 20, 1915, and her\r\nremains were interred in the cemetery at Lancaster. Mr. Blair is a\r\nDemocrat. He attends the Methodist church, and is a member of the Eagles\r\nand Modern Woodmen of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GEORGE H. T. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable distinction in being the oldest practicing\r\nphysician in Atchison county, and this well merited honor properly\r\nbelongs to Dr. George H. T. Johnson, of Atchison, Kan., who for nearly\r\nhalf a century has practiced his profession continuously in the city\r\nwith ever increasing prestige and success which has never abated during\r\nthe long period of his career. Dr. Johnson is one of the best loved and\r\nwell respected professional men of the city who has won his place in the\r\nfront rank of his profession by sheer merit and ability of a high order.\r\nDespite his seventy-three years of age he still continues to minister to\r\nthe ailing and has kept abreast of the wonderful advances made in\r\nmedical science.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _G. H. T. Johnson_\r\n]\r\n\r\nDr. G. H. T. Johnson was born near Mt. Vernon, Jefferson county,\r\nIllinois, October 15, 1842, a son of James and Lydia (Cricle) Johnson,\r\nthe former a native of Connecticut and the latter of Illinois. His\r\npaternal grandfather, George Johnson, was a soldier in the American army\r\nduring the War of 1812. The father of Dr. Johnson died when he was an\r\ninfant and his mother departed this life at the age of seventy-eight\r\nyears. George H. T. was educated in the public schools of Jefferson\r\ncounty and Mount Vernon. He remained at home until the summer of 1862,\r\nwhen he enlisted in the Union army as a member of Company G, One Hundred\r\nand Tenth regiment, Illinois infantry. In September of the same year\r\nthis regiment was assigned to the command of General Buell, then at\r\nLouisville, Ky., and first saw action at the battle of Perryville, Ky.,\r\nOctober 8, 1862. Subsequently, the One Hundred and Tenth was transferred\r\nto General Rosecrans’ army and took part in the great battle of Stone\r\nRiver and the campaign which resulted in the capture of Chattanooga, and\r\nthe great battle of Chickamauga. He was under General Thomas at the\r\nbattles of Chattanooga, Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge. General\r\nGrant in person directed the maneuvers of Generals Thomas’ and\r\nRosecrans’ combined forces during these famous engagements.\r\nSubsequently, his regiment was assigned to the command of General\r\nSherman and served under Sherman until the close of the Civil war. He\r\ntook part in the siege and capture of Atlanta and the famous March to\r\nthe Sea, which culminated in the capture of Savannah, which city Sherman\r\npresented to President Lincoln as a Christmas gift. He also participated\r\nin the campaign of the Carolinas and was at the last battle fought by\r\nSherman’s army at Bentonville, N. C., and at the surrender of the\r\nConfederate army under Gen. Joseph Johnston near Raleigh. From there the\r\nvictorious army marched to Richmond, thence to Baltimore and on to\r\nWashington, where they participated in the Grand Review. Mr. Johnson was\r\nhonorably discharged from the service and mustered out June 8, 1865. The\r\ndoctor tells many anecdotes of his long and varied army experience which\r\nare all interesting and show that he proved himself not unworthy of the\r\nmartial blood coursing through his veins and transmitted from his\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nUpon his return home from the war Mr. Johnson taught one term of school\r\nand then decided to take up the study of medicine and make the science\r\nof healing his life vocation. Accordingly, he entered the Cleveland\r\nHomeopathic Medical College and subsequently attended the Homeopathic\r\nMedical College of St. Louis, Mo., where he was graduated February 26,\r\n1869. While a student at college he heard of the city of Atchison and\r\nwas impressed with the idea that it would be a good place to locate.\r\nAfter looking around for a few weeks he became convinced that Atchison\r\nwas a desirable location for a young physician and he came here in April\r\nof 1869 and soon built up an excellent practice which grew in volume as\r\nthe years went on. In 1885 Governor Martin appointed Dr. Johnson a\r\nmember of the State board of health, and in April of that year he was\r\nelected president of the board and retained the position for eight\r\nyears. He is president of the Atchison board of pension examiners for\r\nthe United States Government and has acted in that capacity for several\r\nyears, his service as pension examiner beginning during the term of\r\nPresident Arthur and continuing under the administrations of Presidents\r\nHarrison, McKinley, Roosevelt and Taft. He always takes an interest in\r\nthe brothers who fought in the army under the stars and stripes for the\r\npreservation of the American Union and does everything in his power to\r\naid the old soldiers. He is a charter member of the Homeopathic Medical\r\nSociety of Kansas and served two terms as president of this society. He\r\nis also a member and has been a senior member of the American Institute\r\nof Homeopathy, the oldest medical institute in the United States. For\r\nmany years he has been a member of the American Public Health\r\nAssociation, as well as the County, State, and American Medical\r\nAssociations. Fraternally, he is affiliated with the Masonic order, the\r\nIndependent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Ancient Order of United\r\nWorkmen, and has been a surgeon of John A. Martin Post, No. 93, Grand\r\nArmy of the Republic, since its organization, excepting two years when\r\nhe served as the post commander. Dr. Johnson is a man of wide and\r\nthorough experience, broad and tolerant in his views, who has commanded\r\nthe confidence and high esteem of the people of Atchison and the\r\nsurrounding country during the many years in which he has been a\r\nresident of the city. He is one of the best known men in the county and\r\nholds high rank as a physician whose skill has not suffered abatement as\r\nthe years have gone by.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHARLES H. JOHNSON\r\n\r\nDr. Charles H. Johnson, his son, practices with his father. He is a\r\ngraduate of the Kansas State University and completed a course in the\r\nmedical department of Columbia University, N. Y., and also graduated\r\nfrom the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York City. For two\r\nyears he served as staff physician of the Roosevelt Hospital of New York\r\nCity, where he gained a wide and varied experience in the practice of\r\nhis profession that has proven to be invaluable to him in his later\r\ncareer. Since locating in Atchison with his father he has built up a\r\nfine practice and served for ten years as surgeon of the Orphans’ Home\r\nat Atchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THOMAS C. TREAT.\r\n\r\nThomas C. Treat, who is engaged in the investment brokerage business in\r\nAtchison, is one of the extensive land owners of Atchison county. Mr.\r\nTreat is a native of Atchison county, born March 26, 1865, and is a son\r\nof Levi S. and Mary D. (Cooper) Treat, the former a native of\r\nConnecticut and the latter of England. Mary D. Cooper was born in\r\nExeter, Devonshire, England, and was a daughter of Thomas and Mary A.\r\nCooper. The Cooper family immigrated to America when Mary D. was a\r\nchild. The family consisted of the parents and three children. They made\r\nthe trip across the Atlantic in a sailing vessel, the voyage taking six\r\nweeks. They located at Covington, Ky., where the parents spent their\r\nlives. Mary D. Cooper had friends living in Atchison, and came here in\r\n1857, where she later met and married Levi S. Treat. Levi S. Treat was\r\nborn in Connecticut in 1814, and was a son of Amos Treat, who removed\r\nwith his family to the Western Reserve, which comprised twelve counties\r\nin northeastern Ohio. The Treat family located in that section in 1828,\r\nwhen Levi S. was fourteen years old, and there the parents spent the\r\nremainder of their lives.\r\n\r\nWhen a young man, Levi S. Treat was in the employ of the Government,\r\nprospecting for copper in the Lake Superior region. He was thus engaged\r\nfor eight or ten years, and in 1856 came to Atchison county, Kansas.\r\nShortly after arriving here, he preëmpted 160 acres of land, part of\r\nwhich is now included within the city limits of Atchison. Here he\r\nfollowed farming and fruit growing in the early days and prospered and\r\nacquired considerable land. He dealt quite extensively in real estate\r\nand was one of the early promoters of Atchison, and built the first\r\nbrick business house in that city. This building was located two doors\r\neast of the Byrum Hotel. Levi S. Treat was a successful business man and\r\none of the substantial citizens of Atchison county. During the Civil war\r\nhe was a colonel of the Twelfth regiment, Kansas militia. He died April\r\n13, 1881, and his wife survived him for several years, passing away\r\nMarch 29, 1913. They were the parents of six children, as follows: Kate\r\nmarried Samuel K. Woodworth, and they reside in California; Frank\r\nresides in Arizona; Thomas C., the subject of this sketch; Alice married\r\nGeorge Guerrier, of Atchison, Kan.; Grace married William Berry, of\r\nAtchison, Kan., and Ethel married Harry McDuff, of Omaha, Neb.\r\n\r\nThomas C. Treat was reared in Atchison and educated in the public\r\nschools, and later attended St. Benedict’s College. He then was engaged\r\nin fruit growing for a number of years, and in 1889 engaged in the\r\ninvestment and brokerage business in Atchison, and has continued in that\r\nbusiness to the present time. Mr. Treat owns over 1,100 acres of land\r\nbesides various other interests and investments. He is one of the\r\npioneer fruit growers of Atchison county, and owns a fifty-acre fruit\r\nfarm, which has few equals, if any, in the State of Kansas. The trees on\r\nthis place are about fifteen years old, and, under normal conditions,\r\nare very productive. Mr. Treat has made an extensive study of the fruit\r\nbusiness and has developed a scientific system of treating his trees. He\r\nwas the first fruit man in Atchison county to use the spray method, and\r\nhe has been very successful in the fruit business.\r\n\r\nMr. Treat was one of the organizers of the Union Trust Company, which\r\nwas later merged into the Exchange State Bank, and has been a director,\r\nor other officer, in that institution since its organization. He is also\r\na stockholder in the Exchange State Bank. He is a member of the\r\nBenevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and is one of the progressive\r\nand public spirited citizens of Atchison county.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHARLES H. FUHRMAN.\r\n\r\nCharles H. Fuhrman, farmer and stockman, of Lancaster township, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, was born in Schleasien, Germany, December 13, 1852. He\r\nis a son of Ernst and Louise (Heine) Fuhrman, and is their only child.\r\nThe father was married again, however, and to his second wife, Johanna\r\nGerlach, twelve children were born, as follows: Ernst, Atchison, Kan.;\r\nCaroline (Dierking), Dodge City, Kan.; Louise (Repstein), Jefferson\r\ncounty, Kansas; William, St. Joseph, Mo.; Reinhold, farmer, Lancaster\r\ntownship, Atchison county, Kansas; Julius, Doniphan county, Kansas;\r\nTraugot, Center township, Atchison county; Herman, Lancaster township,\r\nAtchison county; Paul, Center township, Atchison county; Emma (Schwope),\r\nCenter township. Two children died in infancy. The father was born in\r\nGermany July 8, 1826, and in 1872 came to America and settled in\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, where he bought 160 acres of land in section\r\n16, Lancaster township. This was timber and prairie land and there was\r\nonly a small, poorly built house on it at the time, but during the\r\ntwenty years which he owned it he built several substantial buildings\r\nand made numerous improvements. He then sold the place to his son,\r\nHerman, and removed to Lancaster, where he lived in quiet, well-earned\r\nretirement for five years, when he went to live with his son, Paul, in\r\nCenter township, where he died September 2, 1915. The mother, Louise\r\n(Heine) Fuhrman, died in Germany when a young woman in 1852. Charles\r\nFuhrman’s stepmother, Joehanna (Gerlach) Fuhrman, was born in Germany,\r\nand is now living with her daughter, Emma, in Center township, Atchison\r\ncounty, in her eighty-fifth year.\r\n\r\nCharles Fuhrman left Germany with his parents when he was nineteen years\r\nof age. He had received his education under the German system, and had\r\nbeen taught the carpenter’s trade, but never followed this occupation\r\nafter he came to America. He remained with his parents, helping his\r\nfather on the farm in Lancaster township until he was twenty-five years\r\nold, when he bought 160 acres of land in section 18, Lancaster township.\r\nWhen he took possession the farm had no improvements, and he first built\r\na house and a barn, and added other improvements and conveniences. He\r\nacquired more land until he now owns 390 acres, including eight acres of\r\nfine timber land on his home place and ten acres of timber on the farm\r\nwhich he rents. He has stocked his farm with graded animals. Besides his\r\nreal estate investments, Mr. Fuhrman is a shareholder in the Huron\r\nTelephone Company. He was married in 1878 to Louise Roerchen, who was\r\nborn in Germany July 16, 1857. She left her native land with her uncle,\r\nKarl Schwope, in 1860. They came to Wathena, Doniphan county, Kansas.\r\nHer mother died on the ocean while coming to America and the little\r\ndaughter was reared by her grandparents in Doniphan county and attended\r\nthe grammar school at Wathena. Six children were born to Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFuhrman: Ernst, farmer, Lancaster township, Atchison county; Ida\r\n(Tuley), deceased; William, Lancaster township; Selma (Lange),\r\nGrasshopper township, Atchison county; Edward, living at home; Mabel,\r\nalso living with her parents. Mr. Fuhrman is a Republican, and has been\r\nroad overseer of Lancaster township. He belongs to the Evangelical\r\nchurch, and is a member of the Modern Woodmen of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHARLES LINLEY.\r\n\r\nA true analysis of the growth and development of the manufacturing and\r\ncommercial enterprises of a city invariably brings forth the fact that\r\nwhile the interested principals furnished capital, energy and ability,\r\nits financial institutions were also material factors. The city of\r\nAtchison is not an exception to the rule. The policy of her banks has\r\nbeen, since the first one was established, to extend assistance to\r\nmerchants and manufacturers. Both executives and directors have been\r\nkeenly alive to the fact that a liberal policy, in so far as was\r\nconsistent with sound banking, was essential to commercial growth. Among\r\nthose who have realized success in this field of activity is he whose\r\nname initiates this article. He first entered the banking life of the\r\ncity in the early nineties, subsequently served Atchison county in an\r\nofficial capacity and re-entered financial circles as one of the\r\norganizers of the Union Trust Company in 1907, was later elected cashier\r\nof the Exchange State Bank, and in 1911 resigned to accept his present\r\nposition, that of cashier of the First National Bank.\r\n\r\nCharles Linley was born in the city of Atchison July 10, 1867, and is\r\nthe only surviving member of the family of Dr. James M. Linley, a\r\npioneer physician of the city and one of her most influential citizens.\r\nDr. Linley was born in Salem, Ky., the son of a pioneer, and was of\r\nEnglish descent. He was reared in his native State, received a good\r\nacademic and classical education, and subsequently entered Miami Medical\r\nCollege at Cincinnati, Ohio, from which he was graduated with the Degree\r\nof Doctor of Medicine. During the closing years of the Civil war he\r\nentered the Union army as a regimental surgeon and served until the\r\nclose of the conflict. Previous to entering the army he had married Mary\r\nA. Hubbard, a daughter of Charles Hubbard, of Hickman, Ky., a member of\r\none of Kentucky’s most prominent families, an influential citizen and a\r\nwidely known and successful physician.\r\n\r\nFollowing his service in the Union army, he came to the conclusion that\r\nKansas spelled opportunity for him, and bringing his family, located in\r\nthe city of Atchison in 1865. From this time until his death, which\r\noccurred November 28, 1900, he continued in the active practice of his\r\nprofession. He was recognized as one of the most successful physicians\r\nand surgeons in northeastern Kansas. He was a man of attractive\r\npersonality, was intimately acquainted throughout the city and county\r\nand held in the highest esteem by all who knew him. His record for\r\ncontinuous years of practice has seldom been equaled in the State. He\r\nwas a believer in the religion of deed, and his creed was to do good. He\r\nbelieved in the gospel of help and hope. For forty-five years he lived\r\nhis creed and preached his gospel to the citizens of his adopted State.\r\nHe was not only a successful physician but also realized a substantial\r\nsuccess in a commercial way. He was directly or indirectly interested in\r\nmany business enterprises. He was one of the active forces in the\r\norganization of the First National Bank, and from the establishment\r\nuntil his death was a member of its directorate. He and his wife were\r\nprominent in the social and religious life of the city, and the Linley\r\nresidence was known for its gracious hospitality which was extended to\r\ntheir many friends with true Kentucky spirit. Dr. and Mrs. Linley were\r\nthe parents of five children, all of whom, with the exception of our\r\nsubject, are deceased. Hubbard Linley, the eldest, was graduated in\r\nmedicine and became one of the most prominent surgeons in northeast\r\nKansas. He was division surgeon of the Missouri Pacific railway,\r\nAtchison district. His death occurred in July, 1911. Thomas died in\r\nchildhood; Victor, on November 20, 1915; and Maria died in childhood.\r\n\r\nCharles Linley was reared in the city of Atchison and received his early\r\neducation in its public schools. Subsequently, he entered Kansas\r\nUniversity, where he completed a course in English. He initiated his\r\ncommercial career in 1887 when he entered the employ of the First\r\nNational Bank of Atchison in the capacity of collector. In 1892 he was\r\nappointed deputy treasurer of Atchison county. That he filled this\r\nposition satisfactorily is attested through his having been elected\r\ntreasurer of the county in 1899 and re-elected to that office in 1902.\r\nHis second term expired in 1905, but he held over until 1907, as the\r\ngentleman elected to the office in the fall of 1904 died before being\r\nsworn in. The administration of the affairs of this office under Mr.\r\nLinley was marked by efficiency, economy and courtesy. During the last\r\ntwo years of this service he was the junior member of the Antle-Linley\r\nGrain Company of Atchison. In 1907 he was actively concerned in\r\norganizing the Union Trust Company of Atchison, and was elected\r\nsecretary and treasurer. He filled this position until 1909, when the\r\nExchange State Bank was organized. This institution took over the Union\r\nTrust Company, and Mr. Linley was elected cashier. He remained with the\r\nExchange State Bank until 1911, when he was elected cashier of the First\r\nNational Bank, the institution in which he had received his first\r\nbusiness experience some twenty years previous, and in the organization\r\nof which his father was an active factor. To the banking fraternity Mr.\r\nLinley is known as an energetic, able and progressive executive, one who\r\nhas brought the administrative policy of his bank to a point of high\r\nefficiency. He has extensive commercial interests aside from the bank.\r\nHe is a stockholder in the Globe Publishing Company, the Bailor Plow\r\nCompany, and the Cain Milling Company. Since attaining his majority, he\r\nhas been active in the political life of the county, and is one of the\r\ninfluential members of the Progressive party. Mr. Linley is a member and\r\npast exalted ruler of Atchison Lodge, No. 647, Benevolent and Protective\r\nOrder of Elks. He is also a member of Atchison Lodge, No. 404, Loyal\r\nOrder of Moose.\r\n\r\nOn June 26, 1890, in Atchison, Mr. Linley married Miss Roberta Wilson\r\nRiddell, a daughter of Mrs. Josephine E. Riddell. They have one child\r\nRobert Wilson Linley, born in Atchison, March 8, 1894. He was educated\r\nin the public schools of his native city and graduated from its high\r\nschool. In 1911 he entered the law department of Kansas University,\r\nremaining until 1913, when he entered the University of Wisconsin, where\r\nhe completed a course in English. In 1915 he entered the employ of the\r\nFirst National Bank of Atchison in the capacity of collector and\r\nremittance clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM H. BUSH.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Bush, farmer and stockman, of Lancaster township, Atchison\r\ncounty, was born January 16, 1856, in Hanover, Pa. He is a son of Elias\r\nD. and Sarah (Keithline) Bush, and was one of six children, as follows:\r\nWilliam, subject of this sketch; Samuel, deceased; John, deceased;\r\nAndrew, foreman of tailoring establishment in St. Louis, Mo.; Charles\r\nF., signal man for the Missouri Pacific railway in Colorado; Minnie,\r\nAtchison, Kan. Elias D. Bush, the father, was born December 16, 1834, in\r\nPennsylvania. He was a stationary engineer and also followed farming for\r\na time. During the eighties he came to Atchison county and took up\r\nfarming in Shannon township. For a few years he rented his land, but\r\nlater bought 160 acres in section 26, Lancaster township, which is now\r\nowned by Amel Markwalt. Elias D. Bush followed farming here until 1904,\r\nwhen he sold his place and removed to Atchison, where he is now living\r\nin retirement. William H. Bush’s mother was born February 27, 1834, in\r\nHanover, Pa., and died in 1890, and is buried in Lancaster cemetery.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Bush attended the common schools in Hanover, Pa., and later\r\nworked in the coal mines. In 1876 he left the East and came to Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, and for five years worked for his uncle, Andrew\r\nKeithline, and then rented land in Shannon township for eleven years. He\r\nwas successful in this venture, and in 1890 bought the farm of 160 acres\r\nwhich he now farms, in Lancaster township. When he took the farm it had\r\nonly the most meager improvements, consisting chiefly of a small house\r\nand an old barn, both in a dilapidated condition. Mr. Bush has built a\r\nfine eleven-room house and a large barn, 64×60 feet. This barn cost him\r\n$3,000, and he is willing to wager that it is one of the best, though\r\nperhaps not the largest, in Atchison county. He now owns 320 acres of\r\nland in Lancaster township and has a number of head of high grade stock,\r\nincluding Shorthorn cattle and Duroc Jersey hogs. Mr. Bush is a\r\npractical farmer, who, with practically no start, has, by hard work and\r\ndiligent economy, become a man of comfortable circumstances. He holds a\r\nposition of high esteem among the many acquaintances he has made in\r\nAtchison county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL J. HINES\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM H. BUSH\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GEORGE DORSSOM\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHAS. H. FALK\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn March 30, 1881. Mr. Bush was united in marriage with Ellen J.\r\nChristian, a native of the Isle of Man, a small island in the Irish sea\r\nlying between Ireland and England. She was born January 24, 1857, a\r\ndaughter of Charles and Mary (Kneale) Christian, both of whom were\r\nnatives of the Isle of Man. Mrs. Bush died in February, 1911. They had\r\nsix children, as follows: Cora, Atchison, Kan.; Harry, Atchison, Kan.;\r\nMary Smithson, Lancaster, Kan.; Ina, deceased; Sarah, Atchison Kan.;\r\nJessie, Atchison, Kan. On October 29, 1913, Mr. Bush married Mary E.\r\nChristian, a niece of his first wife, and a daughter of Charles and\r\nEllen J. (Wade) Christian, natives of the Isle of Man. She was born near\r\nPardee, Atchison county, March 21, 1869, and attended the Catholic\r\nparochial school of Atchison. They have no children. Mr. Bush is a\r\nRepublican and attends the Methodist church. He is a member of the\r\nIndependent Order of Odd Fellows and Modern Woodmen of America of\r\nLancaster. He also is a member of the Atchison County Protective\r\nAssociation, of which he was one of the organizers, and served as\r\npresident of the association for a number of years.\r\n\r\nMr. Bush is one of the most successful farmers in Kansas and is the\r\nowner of a highly productive tract of land. As an illustration of his\r\nsuccess as a farmer, the records show that from a tract of twenty-one\r\nacres there was corn produced at an average of 108 bushels to the acre\r\nthe first year, ninety-seven bushels to the acre the second year, and\r\neighty-four bushels to the acre the third year, after which the land was\r\nsown to wheat in the natural order of crop rotation and the yield was\r\nthirty-eight bushels to the acre. Mr. Bush is a firm believer in crop\r\nrotation as a means of preserving the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MICHAEL J. HINES.\r\n\r\nFor an individual to come to Atchison county without funds and with\r\npractically no influential friends to assist him to achieve success, it\r\nis remarkable for him to accomplish in the rather brief period of\r\ntwenty-six years as much as has been done by Michael J. Hines, of\r\nLancaster township, Atchison county. It is apparent that Kansas presents\r\nunusual opportunities for a man to better his condition, if one man can\r\naccumulate 480 acres of land, become president of a flourishing banking\r\nconcern and a stockholder in another important city bank. The main\r\nreason for Mr. Hines’ wonderful success must lie in the ability of the\r\nman himself, and the reviewer must of necessity conclude that the power\r\nto achieve was inherent in his mental and physical makeup, which,\r\ncombined with industry, decided financial ability, honesty and\r\nuprightness has made him one of the leading citizens of his adopted\r\ncounty. Mr. Hines is a scion of old southern families, and comes of good\r\nold Virginia stock on his mother’s side, being descended from the well\r\nknown Hunter family of Virginia, who were among the founders of the\r\nBaptist church in the southland. Mr. Hines is a large stockholder and\r\ndirector, and was formerly vice-president of the Antelope Peak copper\r\nmines of Arizona. He is the owner of a 320–acre irrigated ranch in the\r\nValier valley of Montana, near Valier.\r\n\r\nMichael J. Hines was born July 5, 1863, in Roanoke county, Virginia, and\r\nwas one of the twelve children of Henry and Katherine (Jeter) Hines, six\r\nof whom are living. The father was born in Rockingham county, Virginia,\r\nin 1833. He was a Confederate soldier during the Civil war, having\r\nenlisted in Virginia but was not in any battles during the war. His life\r\nwas spent in farming except for a time when he speculated in Confederate\r\nmoney. At the close of the war he had a sack full of Confederate scrip\r\nwhich could not be redeemed. He died at his home in Abington, Va., in\r\n1898. His father, Richard Hines, was of Irish descent and was a\r\nplantation owner in Virginia. His mother was Sallie (Howmaker) Hines,\r\nand was of German descent. The mother of Michael Hines was also a\r\nVirginian, having been born in Bedford county, Virginia, in 1841. She\r\ndied in 1890. She was a daughter of Allison Jeter. Her mother was a\r\nmember of the Hunter family, who were among the first members of the\r\nBaptist church.\r\n\r\nMichael Hines was reared and educated in Virginia and left that State in\r\n1883 when he was twenty years of age, settling in Morgan county,\r\nIllinois, where he worked as a farm hand for six years. He then came to\r\nAtchison, Kan., and was engaged as foreman by the Greenleaf & Baker\r\nGrain Company. Six years later he bought his present farm of 160 acres.\r\nIt was unimproved and none of the land was broken. Since buying the land\r\nhe has made $10,000 worth of improvements on his place and has set out\r\nfifteen acres of orchard. This evidence speaks for the thrift and good\r\njudgment of Mr. Hines. He also has bought 480 acres of land in Lancaster\r\ntownship. He is a live, progressive farmer and stock raiser and keeps\r\ngraded stock of all kinds on his farm. Mr. Hines is a shareholder and\r\npresident of the Lancaster State Bank, and is also a stockholder in the\r\nGerman-American Bank of Atchison, Kan. In politics Mr. Hines is a\r\nDemocrat, but votes independently in county and State affairs, and for\r\nthe individual.\r\n\r\nMr. Hines was married in 1890 at Alexander, Ill., to Lillie Kaiser, who\r\nwas born August 27, 1870, and six children have been born to this union,\r\nas follows: Samuel, who was graduated from the Atchison business\r\ncollege, and is now farming at home; Frank, Helen, Louise and Lillian,\r\nall living at home, and one died in infancy. Mr. Hines is a member of\r\nthe Methodist church and is a trustee and steward in the Shannon\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church. He belongs to the Modern Woodmen of America\r\nand the Independent Order of Odd Fellows of Lancaster, Kan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHARLES H. FALK.\r\n\r\nCharles H. Falk, of Shannon township, is the owner of the first tract of\r\nland which was filed upon in the Atchison county land office in 1854.\r\nThis farm was preëmpted by Capt. William Jackson, who was a justice of\r\nthe peace and a captain of home guards during the Civil war, and died at\r\nFt. Worth, Tex., in 1911. The first house built on the place was made\r\nfrom material taken from the cabin of a river steamer sunk in the\r\nMissouri river. Henry Falk, father of Charles, and his son, have made so\r\nmany excellent improvements on the dwelling that the dining room of the\r\npresent residence is the only part of the old cabin now in use. This\r\npart of the home was built in 1857. The original owner set out a grove\r\nof cottonwoods in 1857 which was cut down in the fall of 1892 by the\r\npresent proprietor, and erected a barn from the lumber sawed, which made\r\nover 112,000 feet of good merchantable lumber. Mr. Falk’s barn was built\r\nfrom this lumber, with the exception of the shingles. Captain Jackson\r\nsold the land to Frank Fisher, who died in 1877, six months after the\r\npurchase, and it was bought by Henry Falk, father of Charles H., in\r\n1878. After Henry Falk’s death, Charles H. came into possession of the\r\nland by inheritance, and by purchase of the interests of the other\r\nheirs. He has made very extensive improvements since becoming the owner\r\nand despite that the soil has been in constant cultivation for more than\r\nsixty years the yield of crops is greater now than ever before, and the\r\nwheat crops in late years have exceeded twenty-two bushels an acre. The\r\nfarm residence is attractively situated, in the center of the tract of\r\n155 acres and is reached by a splendid driveway, kept in first class\r\ncondition by Mr. Falk. In fact, the private road to the Falk residence\r\nis kept in far better condition than many of the country roads in\r\nAtchison county, and is in keeping with the general appearance of this\r\nfine farm.\r\n\r\nCharles H. Falk was born May 23, 1864, in Watertown, Wis., a son of\r\nHenry, born in 1815, and died, 1894, and of Wilhelmina (Clout) Falk,\r\nborn 1819, and died in 1901. Both parents were born on the River Rhine\r\nin Germany, and married in their native land. Henry Falk was a cabinet-\r\nmaker and immigrated to Wisconsin in 1857, and worked at his trade until\r\n1866, when he settled on a farm. He came to Atchison county with his\r\nfamily in 1879, and on February 2, of that year, moved on the farm which\r\nhe had purchased the preceding year.\r\n\r\nCharles H. Falk was married in 1885 to Elizabeth Wolters, a daughter of\r\nJohn Wolters, a native of Holland, who was one of the first brick-makers\r\nin Atchison and Doniphan counties. John Wolters emigrated from Holland\r\nto Doniphan county, Kansas, in 1857, and came to Atchison in 1858.\r\nDuring his long residence in Atchison he has been a manufacturer of\r\nbrick, and the results of his handiwork are seen in the construction of\r\nmany of the brick buildings in the city. Mr. Wolters was born in May,\r\n1827, and is now over eighty-nine years of age and the oldest Atchison\r\ncounty resident at the present time. He lives a retired life on South\r\nSecond street. Mr. and Mrs. Falk have children as follows: John H., a\r\nresident of Beattie, Marshall county, married Margaret Gressel, and they\r\nhave two children, Karl and Pauline; Henry, in the employ of the Symns\r\nGrocer Company; Anna, a seamstress, living with her parents; Rose, wife\r\nof John McGrath, a traveling salesman for the Symns Grocer Company, and\r\nthey have one child, Rosemary; Herbert, aged twenty years, and Irene,\r\naged ten years, both of whom are at home with their parents.\r\n\r\nMr. Falk and his family are members of St. Benedict’s Catholic Church,\r\nand Mr. Falk is a member of the church committee of four councilors. He\r\nis a Democrat, but is inclined to be independent in his voting, having a\r\ndecided leaning toward the support of those candidates that seem best\r\nfitted for the office. He has filled no civic office but that of\r\ntownship trustee, which he held for one year, having been appointed by\r\nthe county commissioners to fill a vacancy in Shannon township. He is\r\naffiliated with the Catholic Mutual Benefit Association and the Central\r\nProtective Association and is a member of the St. Joseph society.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GEORGE DORSSOM.\r\n\r\nGeorge Dorssom, one of the oldest living pioneer settlers of Lancaster\r\ntownship in point of residence, now living retired at Lancaster,\r\nAtchison county, was born August 4, 1864, in Lancaster township,\r\nAtchison county. He is a son of George and Sophia (Storm) Dorssom, and\r\nwas one of thirteen children, four boys and five girls of whom are still\r\nliving. The subject of this sketch was the seventh child of the family.\r\nThe father of George Dorssom, whose name also was George, was born in\r\nGermany January 8, 1820. He sailed to America and settled in New Orleans\r\nwhen a young man and worked as a tailor there. He then went to Wayne\r\ncounty, Ohio, where he worked as a tailor for a time, when he engaged in\r\nfarming. In 1860 he came to Atchison county, Kansas, and bought forty\r\nacres of prairie land in section 21, Lancaster township, which he broke\r\nwith oxen. He farmed on this place until his death in January, 1895. He\r\ncame to America a stranger and without funds, but by hard work he\r\naccumulated considerable means and reared ten out of a family of\r\nthirteen children. His wife, Sophia, was a devoted helpmate, and when\r\nthey were struggling to make their farm pay, she would load up a small\r\nhand wagon with vegetables and garden truck and pull it to Lancaster,\r\nwhere she would sell or exchange the produce for goods. This trip was\r\ntwo miles, and it was a great exertion for Mrs. Dorssom, but she was\r\nglad to be able to help her husband in whatever way she could. After the\r\ndeath of her first husband she was married again on February 19, 1896,\r\nto Jacob Merkel, a native of Germany. He died March 12, 1908. His wife\r\nis still active, despite her age, and lives in Lancaster with a maid.\r\nShe is able to be about her work and takes a keen interest in life. Her\r\nchildren are: Mrs. Margaret Kleppe, a widow, residing in Brown county,\r\nKansas; Mrs. Katherine Hinz, a widow, Lancaster, Kan.; John, farmer,\r\nLancaster township; Mrs. Caroline Kloepper, deceased; Mrs. Sophia Myer,\r\nliving in Soldier, Jackson county, Kansas; Adam, Lancaster township;\r\nLouisa Henrietta, dead; Mrs. Lizzie Myer, of Lancaster; Dora W.,\r\ndeceased; Adam, of Lancaster, Kan.; Mrs. Louisa Fridel, Brown county,\r\nKansas; Henry, farmer, and three children who died in infancy. She has\r\nforty-five grandchildren and fifteen great-grandchildren and is very\r\nproud of them all. Her descendants all carry the idea of an industrious\r\nwoman with them and the influence of the life of this woman will stay\r\nwith them all through their lives.\r\n\r\nGeorge Dorssom, the subject of this sketch, was reared on the farm of\r\nhis father. He attended school in the Bell district and worked on his\r\nfather’s farm until he was twenty-five years of age. He then bought\r\neighty acres of land from his father in section 21, Lancaster township,\r\nand followed farming for fifteen years. He has added forty acres to his\r\nfarm and made extensive improvements to the extent of $7,000. He now\r\nowns 138 acres of land and a fine residence with about five acres of\r\nresidence property in Lancaster, Kansas. Mr. Dorssom was a breeder of\r\nBerkshire hogs, to which he paid special attention. In 1909 he retired\r\nand moved to Lancaster, Kan. He is a Republican and was a member of the\r\ncity council for four years. For a term of seven years he was road\r\nsupervisor of Lancaster township. He has always taken an active interest\r\nin public affairs of his community. He has led a useful life and looks\r\nback on one of the longest careers of living citizens who were born in\r\nAtchison county. He has traveled in many parts of the United States, but\r\nis glad to have settled down in retirement in Atchison county, believing\r\nit to be the happiest country he has ever seen.\r\n\r\nOn December 31, 1890, Mr. Dorssom married Hulda Hinz, who was born in\r\nGermany October 1, 1860. She came to America when she was twenty years\r\nold. Her father, Edward Hinz, died in Germany in 1895, at the age of\r\nfifty-eight years. The mother, Caroline (Lutce) Hinz, came to Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, in 1896, and now resides at Leavenworth. Mrs. Dorssom\r\nattended school in Germany. She was one of nine children. A brother,\r\nRichard, is a florist at Leavenworth, Kan., and two brothers are in the\r\nsame business, one, Rudolph, at St. Joseph, Mo., and the other, Amiel,\r\nat Leavenworth. Mr. and Mrs. Dorssom have no children, but they adopted\r\na child, Gustave Hinz, a nephew of Mrs. Dorssom. They reared and\r\neducated him, and he is now farming on the home place. Both Mr. and Mrs.\r\nDorssom are members of the English Lutheran church. He is a charter\r\nmember of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and has been a member of\r\nthe Lancaster Lodge of Odd Fellows, No. 355, since October, 1891, nearly\r\ntwenty-five years. Mrs. Dorssom is a charter member of the Daughters of\r\nRebekah Lodge, No. 431.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CYRUS E. DAVIS.\r\n\r\nCyrus E. Davis, founder and proprietor of the firm C. E. Davis & Sons,\r\nplumbing and heating contractors, at 509 Kansas avenue, is one of\r\nAtchison’s leading citizens, and a successful business man who has built\r\nup his business from a modest beginning in a few short years. He first\r\nstarted with a small shop on Commercial street, and in October, 1914,\r\nmoved to his present location. A complete stock of plumbing, heating and\r\nsteam fitting goods is carried in the shop, exceeding a value of $2,500.\r\nThe excellence and thoroughness of the work done by the Davis\r\nestablishment is marked, and the business is constantly on the increase.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis was born October 10, 1864, in Frederick county, Maryland, son\r\nof George W. and Belinda (Saunders) Davis. The Davis family is a very\r\nold one of Welsh extraction in America. The founders of this family were\r\nfour brothers, who crossed the ocean and left their native land of Wales\r\nearly in the seventeenth century. George W. Davis was also born in\r\nFrederick county, Maryland, and became a contractor and builder. He\r\nfollowed his trade in his native State until 1873, when he migrated to\r\nNebraska with his family. Later he went to Texas, where he died in 1900.\r\nHe was the father of nine sons, as follows: George W., a contractor and\r\nbuilder, of David City, Neb.; Harry W., a building contractor, of\r\nHouston, Texas; Theodore E., a contracting painter, of Columbus, Neb.;\r\nMahlon, a tailor, located in Norwalk, Ohio; William M., deceased; Lewis\r\nA., a tinner and coppersmith, of San Bernardino, Cal., in the employ of\r\nthe Santa Fe railroad; Cyrus E., with whom this review is directly\r\nconcerned; Frank H., business agent for the Carpenters’ Union of\r\nOklahoma City, Okla. The mother of these children was also born in\r\nFrederick county, Maryland, in 1825, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Walter\r\nSaunders, natives of England. Walter Saunders came of a good English\r\nfamily and studied in a boarding school of Southhampton, England, and\r\nbecame a school teacher in Maryland. He had the distinction of having\r\ntaught for forty years in one school district in Frederick county,\r\nMaryland, and became well-to-do. Mrs. Davis died in 1889.\r\n\r\nCyrus E. Davis was educated in the public schools of Columbus, Neb.,\r\nlearned his father’s trade when a young man, and after taking a\r\ncorrespondence course in bridge engineering, he entered the employ of\r\nthe Missouri Pacific Railway Company as bridge constructor. He remained\r\nwith this road for five years and came to Atchison in 1886. He was\r\nemployed by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company until 1905 and then\r\nentered the plumbing and heating department of the Farwell Heating\r\nCompany for one and one-half years, and then became foreman for the\r\nThayer Supply Company of Atchison. In the year 1912 he started a shop of\r\nhis own on Commercial street and was successful from the start. It\r\nbecame necessary for him to seek larger quarters, and in October of 1914\r\nhe moved his business and shop to his present location.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis was united in marriage with Ida Mayhood in 1889, and to this\r\nunion have been born seven children, as follows: Frank M., George E.,\r\nReynold, Fred, Norma, Charles, and Verner, deceased. All of Mr. Davis’\r\nsons are associated with him in his business, and have learned to become\r\nexpert plumbers and steamfitters under their father’s tutelage. The\r\nmother of these children was born November 9, 1869, in Leavenworth\r\ncounty, Kansas, a daughter of George and Mary (Carr) Mayhood, natives of\r\nIreland, and Canada, respectively. George Mayhood emigrated from Ireland\r\nin an early day and settled in Leavenworth county about 1865, where he\r\nengaged in farming. He and his wife were married in Lowell, Mass.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis is a Republican, and has taken an active and influential part\r\nin the civic life of his adopted city, having served two terms as a\r\nmember of the city council. He and his family are members of the\r\nChristian church, and he is fraternally connected with the Ancient Free\r\nand Accepted Masons, Active Lodge, No. 158, and the Modern Woodmen of\r\nAmerica, in both of which lodges he is much interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HENRY BUTTRON.\r\n\r\nThe life story of Henry Buttron, late of Lancaster township, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, reveals the accomplishments of a poor German emigrant,\r\nwho began his career in Kansas with no money, and rose to become the\r\npractical leader of the German colony in the township, and to amass\r\nconsiderable wealth. His large farm of 960 acres which he owned at the\r\ntime of his demise was left intact, to be held in trust for his children\r\nand heirs.\r\n\r\nHenry Buttron was born in Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany, October 12, 1831,\r\nand he was one of the five sons of Jacob and Margaret (Zimmer) Buttron,\r\ntwo of whom came to America from their native land. Two brothers of the\r\nfamily, Frederick and Henry, came to America in 1852; Frederick settled\r\nin Pittsburgh, as did Henry, and he resided there until 1854, and then\r\ncame to the West. In his native land, Henry Buttron had learned the\r\ntrade of blacksmith; he worked at his trade in Pittsburgh, and after he\r\ncame west, he was employed as a smith at Elgin, Ill., until 1857. He\r\nthen came to Kansas and preëmpted a claim on section 22, Lancaster\r\ntownship, Atchison county. He brought a small amount of money with him,\r\nand was enabled to build a very small house, and then began to improve\r\nhis farm. The crops failed in 1860, and he found it necessary to resort\r\nto the hammer and anvil in order to gain a livelihood for himself and\r\nhis family. He, accordingly, removed to Atchison and was employed at his\r\ntrade by Tom Ray, of the firm of Ostertag & Carmichael, and Anthony &\r\nOstertag, consecutively for nine years. He then returned to his claim,\r\nredeemed the unpaid taxes, and entered upon a new era of progress and\r\nindustry which led to his great success in the ensuing years. In 1882 he\r\nerected a large, handsome farm house, which at the time was one of the\r\nmost conspicuous homes in the county. He added to his possessions as he\r\nwas able, and accumulated a total of six quarter sections of good land,\r\nof 960 acres in all, all of which he left to his widow, who resides on\r\nthe old home place.\r\n\r\nHenry Buttron was married in Atchison, Kan., in 1866, to Rosa Scheu,\r\nwhose father, Andrew Scheu, came from Wittenberg, Germany. The following\r\nchildren were born to this union: Rosa, wife of Louis Gerhardt, of\r\nAtchison; Emma, wife of Charles Kammer, of Lancaster township; Kate and\r\nJacob, at home; Henry, who married Bertha Kemmer; Fred, married Louise\r\nMeek, lives near Nortonville, Kan.; Anna, wife of George Schulz,\r\nLancaster township; Karl, married Anna Hegland, Lancaster township;\r\nWilliam, George and Louis, at home. The mother of these children was\r\nborn in Germany, in May, 1845, and came to America with her parents when\r\nnine years of age. She was a daughter of Andrew and Rosena (Baner)\r\nScheu, both deceased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mr. and Mrs. Henry Buttron and Family, of Lancaster Township\r\n]\r\n\r\nMrs. Buttron has grandchildren as follows: Kathrine, Rosa and Henrietta\r\nKammer; Henry Buttron’s children, three, Clarence, Esther and Ruth; Fred\r\nButtron has three children, Karl, Ralph, Mildred; Mrs. Anna Schulz has\r\ntwo children, Gilbert and Karl; Mrs. Rosa Gerhardt has one son, William;\r\nKarl Buttron has one child, Edward; Jacob Buttron has four children,\r\nBertha, Emma, Alice and John.\r\n\r\nHenry Buttron died February 8, 1913. During the Civil war he was a\r\nmember of the Kansas State militia, and was in the engagement fought at\r\nWestport, and which resulted in the rout of the forces of the rebel\r\ngeneral, Price. Mr. Buttron always took a keen interest in local and\r\ncounty affairs, and took a prominent part in affairs of importance to\r\nthe well being of the people. He was always modest and unostentatious in\r\nhis conduct, and was greatly respected by the people of his neighborhood\r\nfor his cool judgment and patriotism at all times. Henry Buttron was a\r\ngood citizen, and a kind parent who was highly esteemed by all who knew\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              W. H. SMITH.\r\n\r\nSome men are natural organizers and blessed with such a deep love for\r\nthe well being of their fellowmen that their activities are to a\r\nconsiderable extent devoted to spreading the gospel of good fellowship\r\namong mankind. The social and fraternal orders which are popular among\r\nmen of any locality are simply the outgrowth of that desire, for the\r\nrealization of a great dream for the “Brotherhood of Man,” which was\r\npredicted 2,000 years ago. A man who furthers the growth of\r\norganizations which have the welfare of the individual, singly and\r\ncollectively, at heart is doing a considerable amount of definite good\r\nfor the betterment of social conditions. Such a citizen is W. H. Smith,\r\nthe widely known and efficient clerk of the district court of Atchison\r\ncounty, and a likeable and able personality, who figures prominently in\r\nthe history of his county.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith was born February 3, 1855, at Knoxville, Ill. He is a son of\r\nJohn and Harriet (Gibbons) Smith, natives of England. John Smith, the\r\nfather, was born in 1808, and died in the year 1863. He was a scion of\r\nan English family and was a graduate of Oxford University. He became a\r\ncontractor and builder in his native land, but immigrated to America\r\nwith his wife and three children in 1852, settling in Knoxville, Ill.,\r\nwhere he died eleven years later. He was the father of the following\r\nchildren: Mrs. Sarah Ann Simpson, deceased; Mrs. Harriet Ann Webb, of\r\nBurlington Junction, Mo.; Charles E., of Sierra Blanca, Texas, employed\r\nas a stationary engineer by the Texas Pacific railway since 1880. The\r\nmother of these children departed this life February 2, 1890, aged\r\nseventy-eight years, at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Simpson.\r\n\r\nW. H. Smith was reared in Knoxville, Ill. Being left an orphan at an\r\nearly age, by the death of his father, it was necessary for him to start\r\nwork when a boy and practically earn his own living and educate himself.\r\nBy working on neighboring farms during the spring and summer he was\r\nenabled to attend school during the winter months, and succeeded in\r\nattending the Knoxville high school. He did farm work until 1865 and\r\nthen learned the printing trade in Knoxville, being attached to the\r\nstaff of the Knoxville Republican during the winter of 1866 and ’67, and\r\nremained until 1874 in that capacity. At the early age of twenty years\r\nhe wedded Elmira Kistler, and then settled on a farm in Lehigh county,\r\nPennsylvania, on which was located a tannery. He operated both farm and\r\ntannery until 1880, when he decided to cast his fortunes in the western\r\ncountry. March 2, 1880, he came to Atchison with his family and moved to\r\na farm near Good Intent, five miles northwest of Atchison. The year\r\nbefore this he had made a trip to Atchison county and invested in eighty\r\nacres of land which was partly improved. He developed this tract into a\r\nvery fine farm and sold it at a considerable advance over and above the\r\npurchase price in 1895. In the spring of 1890 Mr. Smith removed to\r\nAtchison and for three years served as night agent at the union station\r\nfor the Wells, Fargo and American Express companies. He then bought an\r\ninterest in the Home Show Printing Company, and was connected with this\r\nconcern in active capacity for a period of twelve years, or until 1905.\r\nThe printing company was then taken over by other parties and he\r\ncontinued working in the office until 1909.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in Atchison county previous to this time, Mr. Smith\r\nhad become prominently identified with the Republican party and had\r\nbecome known as a “wheel horse” of the organization and universally\r\nesteemed by the rank and file of the party. He was elected to the office\r\nof clerk of the district court in the fall of 1908, and began the duties\r\nof his office in January of 1909. He was reëlected in 1912 and again in\r\n1914. He was elected without opposition from any source in 1912, and\r\novercame his opponent in 1914 by the immense plurality of 3,010 votes.\r\nFor a period of three years he was secretary of the Republican central\r\ncommittee, and was for six years a member of the first Atchison county\r\nhigh school board, being one of the surviving members of the original\r\nboard which erected the county high school at Effingham, and was\r\nlikewise a member of the board which rebuilt the school house when it\r\nwas destroyed by fire. Mr. Smith was a member of this board while still\r\na resident of the county and took a prominent part in the inauguration\r\nof this worthy institution, which has been so much appreciated by the\r\npeople of Atchison county.\r\n\r\nIn religious matters Mr. Smith is identified with the Episcopal church.\r\nProbably no man in Atchison county is identified with a greater number\r\nof fraternal organizations than is he. He became a member of the Odd\r\nFellows August 2, 1882, and is also a member of the encampment. Since\r\nJanuary 1, 1915, he has served as a secretary of Friendship Lodge,\r\nIndependent Order of Odd Fellows, No. 5, and has been scribe of the\r\nencampment for the past fifteen years. For eighteen years he has been\r\nsecretary of the board of trustees of the Odd Fellows lodge and is\r\naffiliated with the Rebekahs, and is a member of the canton. Since 1880\r\nhe has been a member of the Central Protective Association and was\r\npractically its originator, and has been the grand secretary of the\r\norder since 1886. The first of the annual outings and picnics held by\r\nthis famous association was conducted in the grove on Mr. Smith’s farm.\r\nVisitors and guests to the number of 10,000 people have attended these\r\npicnics. Mr. Smith has been a member of the Ancient Order of United\r\nWorkmen since 1895, and recorder of the order for thirteen years. He is\r\na member of the Woodmen of the World and has been their banker for six\r\nyears past. He is affiliated with the Knights and Ladies of Security;\r\nthe Kansas Fraternal Citizens; a member of Atchison Aerie, Fraternal\r\nOrder of Eagles, No. 173, and its secretary since 1904. Before removing\r\nto Atchison he was secretary of the Central Protective Association at\r\nGood Intent for five years. He is at present serving his second term as\r\nState secretary of the Kansas Eagles, and has held various offices in\r\nthe State aerie, including the important post of State representative.\r\nSince 1895 Mr. Smith has been a member of the Modern Woodmen; is a\r\nmember of the Fraternal Aid Union, and the Improved Order of Red Men,\r\nand is an honorary member of the Typographical Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith’s happy wedded life began July 4, 1874, when he married\r\nElmira, daughter of Joel and Matilda Kistler, of Lehigh county,\r\nPennsylvania, members of an old Pennsylvania family. Joel Kistler was a\r\nlarge land owner and tannery operator in Lehigh county. He and his\r\nbrother, Stephen, operated a number of tanneries, and were extensive\r\nfarmers, and were very wealthy. Joel Kistler came west, located in\r\nKnoxville, Ill., and invested heavily in Illinois land. He died at Stony\r\nRun, Berks county, Pennsylvania. Mrs. Kistler died at Schnecksville, Pa.\r\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Smith have been born the following children: Estella,\r\nborn July 14, 1875, deceased; Harriet Matilda, born June 6, 1876, wife\r\nof J. A. Wilkinson, of Hershey, Pa., and the mother of two children,\r\nJohn J., aged twelve years, and Michael aged eight years; Isabelle, born\r\nDecember 15, 1880, wife of Dr. J. E. Exter, of Atchison, and mother of\r\none child, Eugene, aged five years; Pearl, born October 12, died April\r\n25, 1890; Helen, born May 1, 1885, wife of R. H. Jones, chief train\r\ndispatcher for the Missouri Pacific railroad at Falls City, Neb., and\r\nmother of one child, Mary Elmira, aged six years; Frank Gibbons Smith,\r\nborn August 8, 1891, and died February 23, 1901.\r\n\r\nW. H. Smith is considered as one of the best officials who has ever\r\nfilled a county office, and he is held in high esteem for his many\r\nexcellent qualities. To his many friends and associates he is\r\naffectionately known as “Big Bill,” an appropriate name on account of\r\nhis large stature, and an appellation which can well be applied to his\r\nheart and mind. While large of body, he is also big-hearted and blessed\r\nwith a breadth of mind and good will which embraces all mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOSEPH W. ALLEN.\r\n\r\nFor over forty-five years Joseph W. Allen, veteran, merchant, and\r\ndescendant of an old and distinguished colonial family, has been\r\nidentified with the civic and mercantile life of the city of Atchison.\r\nHe comes of rugged New England stock, noted for their integrity, honesty\r\nand proverbial industry throughout the United States, and has been one\r\nof the builders of Atchison’s largest wholesale grocery house. Mr. Allen\r\nhas grown up with Atchison, and has come to be one of its best known and\r\nhighly respected citizens, having risen from moderate circumstances at\r\nthe outset of his career to a position of affluence and decided prestige\r\namong the commercial men of northeast Kansas.\r\n\r\nJoseph W. Allen was born in Craftsbury, Orleans county, Vermont, March\r\n2, 1841, a son of Hollis F. and Sophia (Root) Allen, natives of\r\nMassachusetts. The father was a merchant and when a young man removed\r\nfrom his native State to Craftsbury, Vt., where he was engaged in the\r\nmercantile business for a number of years, and in the latter part of his\r\nlife he came to Atchison, Kan., dying in 1874. He had three sons who\r\nserved in the Union army: Frank H., who later came to Atchison and was a\r\nmember of the wholesale drug firm of McPike & Allen; George R. Allen, a\r\nretired manufacturer, living at Alton, Ill., and Joseph W., with whose\r\ncareer this review is directly concerned. A daughter, Anna H., wife of\r\nthe late Frank Howard, founder of the Frank Howard Manufacturing Company\r\nof Atchison, died in 1915 at her home in this city. Another daughter,\r\nNellie, makes her home with her brother, Joseph W., in Atchison, and is\r\nnow in Honolulu. The Allen family is of Scotch origin, and Ethan Allen,\r\nof Revolutionary fame, was a member of the same family.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen was reared to manhood in Vermont and received a good common\r\nschool education, attending the Craftsbury Academy. On October 2, 1861,\r\nin answer to the President’s call for volunteers to defend the Union, he\r\nenlisted for three years in Company I, First regiment, Vermont cavalry.\r\nHe was mustered in with the regiment November 19, 1861, at Burlington,\r\nVt., as bugler, and was mustered out of the service November 18, 1864.\r\nHe left Burlington December 12, 1861, for Washington, D. C., and\r\nremained there with his regiment until February, 1863, at which time he\r\nwas detailed at General De Forest’s headquarters as musician.\r\nAfterwards, he was detailed to General Kilpatrick’s headquarters as\r\nmusician and remained there until General Wilson took command of the\r\ndivision in April, 1864. He was then detailed to General Sawyer’s\r\nheadquarters until October, 1864, at which time he came to Burlington\r\nVt., where he was mustered out of the service. Mr. Allen was in thirty-\r\nseven engagements during his three years of service, and was never\r\nwounded nor captured, nor was he absent from duty a single day on\r\naccount of sickness. His regiment did notable service under Generals\r\nSheridan and Custer, and he was engaged in the famous battle of\r\nWinchester. An incident of Mr. Allen’s army career is well worth\r\nrecording. He effected, single handed, the capture of four Confederate\r\nsoldiers, and the story of the capture is one of the historical\r\nincidents of the great conflict. The incident took place near\r\nLightersville, Md., and it was after the regiment had taken part in the\r\nbattle of Huntersville, Pa., July 2, 1863, and the battle of Gettysburg,\r\nJuly 3, 1863, the battle of Monterey on the Fourth of July,\r\nLightersville on July 5, and on the sixth of July occurred the battle of\r\nHagerstown. The men were all fatigued and had been deprived of both\r\nsleep and rest for several nights in succession, Joseph Allen among the\r\nrest. When they had ridden nearly all night to a point near\r\nLightersville, they halted for rest in the small hours of the morning.\r\nMany were dismounted and fell asleep on the ground, Mr. Allen doing\r\nlikewise. He slept so soundly, however, that when he awoke his comrades\r\nwere gone. It was dark and he was uncertain in which direction the\r\ncommand had gone. He mounted his horse and let the animal pursue its own\r\nway without guidance. Dashing down the road, horse and rider came out\r\ninto a main highway and unexpectedly came upon four men who were as much\r\ntaken by surprise and fright as Allen himself. The rebels, supposing\r\nthat there was a larger number of Union men following, made haste to\r\nsurrender without waiting for an invitation. Allen promptly accepted\r\ntheir surrender and took them along to the main body which was some\r\ndistance ahead. His prisoners proved to be a major, a captain and two\r\nlieutenants of the Eighth Georgia regiment.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen rode during the war a very sensible and intelligent cavalry\r\nhorse, and thereby hangs a tale. In one of the cavalry engagements in\r\nwhich he participated he and his comrade were riding together under\r\nheavy fire. His riding partner was shot from the saddle and Mr. Allen\r\nfelt his own horse sinking under him. Believing that the animal was\r\nmortally hurt he dismounted and jumped on the back of his dead comrade’s\r\nmount and rode away to safety. That night while lying in his blankets\r\nwith the earth for his couch and the starlit sky for a canopy overhead\r\nhe felt something soft and gentle nudging him. Startled, he arose\r\nhastily and was overjoyed to find that it was his favorite horse which\r\nhad returned safely, but badly wounded, from the battlefield, and had\r\nhunted out his master from among the hundreds of recumbent and sleeping\r\nforms on the camping ground.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Craftsbury after his war service and engaged in\r\nmercantile business which he continued until 1870, when he came to\r\nAtchison at the solicitation of his brother, Frank H., who was at that\r\ntime the junior member of the firm of McPike & Allen, wholesale\r\ndruggists of Atchison. Mr. Allen entered the employ of the company as\r\ntraveling salesman and was thus engaged for a period of three years. He\r\nthen embarked in the grocery business in partnership with Colonel Quigg\r\nunder the firm name of Quigg & Allen. Colonel Quigg commanded the\r\nThirteenth Kansas infantry regiment during the Civil war. The firm of\r\nQuigg & Allen carried on a wholesale grocery business for about three\r\nyears. Then Mr. Allen purchased his partner’s interest, and three years\r\nlater consolidated with the A. B. Symns Grocer Company. A. B. Symns\r\nbecame the president of the company and Mr. Allen became vice-president.\r\nWhen Mr. Symns died in 1905 Mr. Allen became president and held the\r\nposition until 1911 when he retired from active participation in the\r\nbusiness, although he still retains a substantial interest in the\r\ncompany. Mr. Allen was one of the dominant individuals in the\r\ndevelopment of the Symns Grocer Company in the extensive concern which\r\nit is at the present time. When he joined forces with Mr. Symns their\r\ncombined capital did not exceed $15,000, and during his period of\r\nassociation with this company their business developed into enormous\r\nproportions, and the capital of the Symns Grocer Company now amounts to\r\n$300,000. Mr. Allen was a natural salesman and had complete charge of\r\nthe traveling sales department of the Symns Grocer Company, and, in\r\nfact, during the first few years was the entire traveling sales force\r\nhimself. Later, as additional salesmen were added to the force he\r\ncontinued to direct the sales department of the business. Mr. Allen is a\r\nprominent factor in the business world of Atchison, and is vice-\r\npresident of the Atchison Savings Bank. He is a member of the Benevolent\r\nand Protective Order of Elks, and in his political views is absolutely\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            RALPH U. PFOUTS.\r\n\r\nRalph U. Pfouts, a leading young attorney of Atchison, is a native son\r\nof Atchison county. He was born at Monrovia December 4, 1890, and is a\r\nson of William A. and Ollie (Sharpless) Pfouts. William A. Pfouts, the\r\nfather, is also a native Kansan, born in Nemaha county in 1861 and is a\r\nson of James and Caroline (Kellam) Pfouts, natives of Pennsylvania,\r\nwhere they were reared and married, and in 1860 came to Kansas, locating\r\nin Nemaha county. The father, James Pfouts, died a few months after\r\ncoming to this State and his wife returned to Pennsylvania with her\r\nlittle family. A few years later, however, the Pfouts family returned to\r\nKansas, locating at Lancaster, Atchison county, and here William A.\r\nPfouts was educated and reared to manhood. He followed farming in early\r\nlife and for eighteen years was a school teacher. In 1896 he engaged in\r\nthe general mercantile business at Lancaster. To William A. and Ollie\r\n(Sharpless) Pfouts were born two children, as follows: Ralph, the\r\nsubject of this sketch, and Mabel, deceased. The wife and mother died in\r\n1901, and in 1905 William A. Pfouts married Miss Sadie M. Monnies.\r\n\r\nRalph U. Pfouts was educated in the public schools of Atchison county,\r\nand Kansas University, at Lawrence, Kan., graduating from the law\r\ndepartment of the latter institution with the class of 1914. Shortly\r\nafter graduating he passed the State bar examination and engaged in the\r\npractice of his profession at Atchison where he is meeting with well\r\nmerited success. He has appeared in connection with important\r\nlitigations in both the State and Federal courts and is enjoying a\r\nlucrative practice. He possesses the natural qualities of an able lawyer\r\nand is an untiring student, and those who know him best predict for him\r\na successful career in his chosen profession. Politically, he is a\r\nRepublican. Mr. Pfouts is a member of the Ancient Order of United\r\nWorkmen, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and Atchison Aerie No. 173,\r\nFraternal Order of Eagles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OLE G. GIGSTAD.\r\n\r\nOle G. Gigstad, farmer and stockman, Lancaster township, was born in\r\nNorway, October 25, 1856. He is a son of Gulick and Anna (Grannan)\r\nGigstad. He was one of seven children, one of whom is now dead. Four\r\nsons and one daughter are now living in the United States. A brother,\r\nKnud G. Gigstad, is also a farmer and stockman in Lancaster township.\r\nThe father was a native of Norway and spent his life there. Ole Gigstad\r\nleft Norway in May, 1883, and came to Atchison county, Kansas, where he\r\nworked a year for his brother, Knud. Then for three years he rented a\r\nfarm from his uncle in Brown county, Kansas, and in 1887 bought the farm\r\nin Lancaster township. It is an eighty acre farm and Mr. Gigstad has\r\nmade improvements to the extent of $5,000, including a fine house and\r\nbarn. He now owns 320 acres of well improved land, 160 acres of which\r\nare being farmed by his oldest son, Gustave, and it has a comfortable\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nOle Gigstad attended school in Norway, but when he sailed for America he\r\ncould not speak the English language, and when he arrived here he was in\r\ndebt to the extent of fifty dollars, which was an additional handicap.\r\nBut his industry has brought him to the front rank of Atchison county\r\nfarmers. He owns a fine herd of graded stock and is a successful farmer\r\nand stockman. He rented eighty acres additional in 1915 and he had 100\r\nacres in corn last year.\r\n\r\nMr. Gigstad was married in 1888 to Severine Knudson, who was born in\r\nNorway, September 23, 1866. She left her native land in the spring of\r\n1883 and settled at Everest, Kan., where her brothers were living at the\r\ntime. In 1884 she removed to St. Joseph, Mo., where she worked four\r\nyears. Her parents were Knud and Inger Sofie (Berntson) Knudson, natives\r\nof Norway. Her father was born in 1814, and immigrated to America in\r\n1891, coming to Atchison county, Kansas, where he lived with his\r\nchildren until his death, in 1894. The mother was born in 1827, and died\r\nin her native country in 1887. Mr. and Mrs. Gigstad have eight children:\r\nGustave A., farming the 160 acres west of his father’s farm; Ida,\r\nCharles, Albert, Emma, Edna, Alice, Benjamin, all living at home. Mr.\r\nGigstad is a member of the Lutheran church and is a Republican.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN H. BARRY.\r\n\r\nJohn H. Barry, chairman of the board of directors of the First National\r\nBank of Atchison, is one of the well known citizens of the city who has\r\nfigured in the development of Kansas, especially the eastern portion of\r\nthe State, for a period of many years. For fifty-seven years he has been\r\na resident of the State, and has made his own way from comparative\r\npoverty in his youth, to a position of affluence which compares most\r\nfavorably with that of the men of his day with whom he has been\r\nassociated. He has seen the Sunflower State develop from a wilderness,\r\nunsettled and unpeopled, except by the wild animals and Indians, to\r\nbecome one of the fairest and greatest of the sub-divisions of the\r\nAmerican Union. He is proud of Atchison and her prestige, and has played\r\nno small part in the task of advancing his adopted city to the forefront\r\nof western municipalities.\r\n\r\nJ. H. Barry is of Celtic origin, having been born in the city of Boston,\r\nof Irish parents, in 1849. His parents, Michael and Ellen (Roach) Barry,\r\nwere natives of County Cork, Ireland, where they were reared and\r\nmarried, and crossed the Atlantic to seek their fortune in the new\r\nworld. Settling in Boston in the early forties, Mr. Barry plied his\r\ntrade of tailor with fair success and owned and conducted his own\r\ntailoring establishment. He died there when John H. was a small boy. His\r\nwidow, accompanied by her son, then journeyed across the country to\r\nLeavenworth in 1858. Here the boy was brought up until he was fifteen\r\nyears of age and in 1862 became a freighter in the employ of the\r\nGovernment. He was a “mule whacker,” or driver, who had charge of a team\r\nof six mules which he drove from Ft. Leavenworth across the Great Plains\r\nto New Mexican points. Saving his earnings, he embarked in the\r\nfreighting business at Leavenworth for himself in 1866, driving his\r\noutfit over the route of the Ft. Scott & Gulf railroad, via Baxter\r\nSprings, Kan., through the Indian Territory to Indian agencies in the\r\nterritory and Texas, carrying wagon loads of merchandise and trinkets on\r\nthe outward bound trip, and bringing back a load of furs, hides and\r\nosage orange seed. The trinkets taken along were intended for the\r\nIndians who exchanged their furs for adornment. The osage orange seed\r\nwas in great demand at this period inasmuch as the settlers were then\r\ngirding their lands with osage hedges. Mr. Barry’s freighting venture\r\nproved profitable, and he made considerable money during the two years\r\nin which he made trips to the Southwest. In 1870 he engaged in railroad\r\ncontracting, and was fairly successful until 1873. He graded and built\r\nmany miles of railroad in southern Kansas and through Oklahoma, and in\r\nthe building of the L. L. & G. R. R., he reaped excellent profits. He\r\nhad his ups and downs, like other contractors, however, and one\r\nexperience in particular very nearly proved his undoing. This was in the\r\nbuilding of the M. K. & T. R. R., in which Mr. Barry had contracted to\r\nbuild a twenty foot embankment for a distance of one mile. It was\r\nunderstood with the railroad officials that the grading was to be\r\ncompleted by the first day of the following year, but he rushed the work\r\nso as to have it completed before the fall rains began. He succeeded in\r\ndoing this early in the fall, but the head contractor, Stewart McCoy,\r\nwould not accept the work as finally done before the time limit of the\r\ncontract, unless he would deduct twenty per cent, from the contract\r\nprice agreed upon. This arrangement meant the complete dissipation of\r\nhis profits, and he finally came through with only his outfits. This\r\nexperience ended Mr. Barry’s contracting career, as far as railroad\r\nbuilding was concerned, and disposing of his outfits, he came to\r\nAtchison in 1873 with a small capital. Here on March 17, 1873, he\r\nentered the employ of the Missouri Pacific railroad as switchman and\r\nremained in the employ of this road until 1879, filling various\r\npositions, such as baggageman, trainman and yardmaster. While engaged in\r\nrailroading he became interested in the civic and political life of\r\nAtchison, and possessing an engaging and candid personality, he made\r\nmany warm friends, and was given political preferment. In the spring of\r\n1879 he was elected constable and held the post and various others for\r\nthree years. Following this office he was appointed chief of the\r\nAtchison city police in 1883 by Mayor C. C. Burns and served until 1885.\r\nIn 1885 he served as superintendent of the Street Railway Company. Since\r\nthen he has taken a more or less active part in political matters in the\r\ncity and county, and is considered one of the political leaders of his\r\nparty. While serving as city marshal he was a United States deputy\r\nmarshal under United States Marshal Ben Simpson. In 1885 he established\r\nthe Barry Coal and Wood Company, which he successfully conducted along\r\nwith other commercial propositions until 1910. He became interested in\r\nthe Atchison Paving Brick Company, and was active in the affairs of this\r\nmanufacturing concern for over fifteen years, being still interested in\r\nthe company. Upon the organization of the Commercial State Bank in\r\nNovember, 1906, he was elected president of the institution, and upon\r\nits consolidation with the First National Bank of Atchison he became\r\nchairman of the board of directors of the new organization.\r\n\r\nMr. Barry’s marriage with Kate Curtin occurred November 28, 1874, and to\r\nthis marriage have been born the following children: John, engaged in\r\nbusiness in New Mexico; Henry, Helen and C. W., deceased; Frances Barry\r\nSimmons, and one son, who died in infancy. The younger daughter is the\r\nwife of O. A. Simmons, whose biography appears in this volume. The\r\nmother of these children was born and reared in Leavenworth, Kan., a\r\ndaughter of John and Helen Curtin, natives of Ohio, who came to\r\nLeavenworth in 1856. John Curtin was a landscape gardener by profession.\r\n\r\nMr. Barry has always been a Democrat. In 1885 he became a candidate for\r\nsheriff of the county, but was defeated by only four votes. In 1887 he\r\nwas again a candidate for the office and was elected by the large\r\nmajority of 1,150 votes. This, too, in the face of the fact that\r\nAtchison county has generally been considered a stronghold of\r\nRepublicanism. So well did he perform the duties of his office, and so\r\npopular did he become that he experienced no difficulty in a second\r\nelection to the sheriff’s office in 1889, with a majority of 850 to his\r\ncredit. It is stated that his majority when elected sheriff of the\r\ncounty was the largest ever given a candidate for the place. He is a\r\nmember of the Catholic church and is fraternally connected with the\r\nAncient Order of United Workmen, the Knights of Columbus, and the Elks.\r\nMr. Barry’s success has been due to a strong and winning personality,\r\nsquareness in the conduct of his business transactions which have been\r\nproverbial, a genius and capacity for organization, which enabled him to\r\nplan and carry out his various undertakings to a successful issue, and\r\nthe ability to make and retain friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WARREN W. GUTHRIE.\r\n\r\nIt is given to relatively few men to leave this world for the mysteries\r\nof the next, contented with what they have done here, and without regret\r\nfor duties unfulfilled. At the end of a lingering illness, giving ample\r\ntime for reflection, and as a last utterance, General Guthrie called\r\ncloser to his bedside his faithful wife and companion and his six living\r\nchildren then gathered about him and whispered to them: “I know that I\r\nam about to leave you forever. I want you to know that I am going\r\nwithout regret except for our separation. I have raised a family in\r\nwhich I have had only pride. I have tried to prepare you to be good\r\nmembers of your own families and useful citizens. I have fought the\r\nfight and my work is done. I am ready to go. I want you to know that I\r\nleave you feeling that I have never done any man an intentional wrong,\r\nor left unfulfilled any duty I was capable of accomplishing, and that I\r\ngo content.”\r\n\r\nThese last whispers give a fair index to the life and character of this\r\nsturdy pioneer Kansan. He was a type of a product of the early years of\r\nstruggle in Kansas, now largely passing away. Diplomacy was a word of\r\nwhich he might never have known the meaning. He at least never practiced\r\nit to the prejudice of frankness. Whether as a friend who could be\r\ndepended upon in any emergency and regardless of consequences to\r\nhimself, or whether as a foe who could not be placated by excuses or\r\noffers of advantage personal to himself, and equally regardless of\r\nconsequences his cards in the game were always upon the table face up.\r\nHe despised sham and pretense in every form, and whether in business,\r\npolitics or the judicial forum, he always fought his way double-fisted,\r\nstraight for the goal.\r\n\r\nBorn June 9, 1834, on a flinty hillside farm on the banks of the\r\nHousatonic river in Connecticut, and ambitious for a broader field, W.\r\nW. Guthrie struck out for himself early in life. At seventeen he was\r\nproviding for his further education by teaching a rural school in New\r\nJersey, on the present site of Long Branch, where the chief\r\nqualification for the teacher was his ability to thrash the biggest\r\nyoung fisherman in the school. In his later years it was one of the\r\ndelights of General Guthrie to tell of his experiences in instructing\r\nthe youth of New Jersey with a clapboard.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 under the well known general advice of Horace Greeley, Mr.\r\nGuthrie, then admitted to the bar, came, seeking his fortune, to Kansas\r\nby way of steamboat up the Missouri river from St. Louis, landing at\r\nWhitecloud, thirty-one miles north of Atchison, then one of the cities\r\nupon the Missouri with small population but unlimited future\r\npossibilities. Shortly afterwards he moved again westward to Hiawatha,\r\nthe county seat of Brown county, where he established himself in\r\npractice, his business radiating to the surrounding counties, which were\r\nreached principally on muleback. General Guthrie was over six feet in\r\nheight, and he loved to tell how, as a lanky young lawyer with a small\r\nmule, it was difficult to keep his feet off the ground in traveling from\r\ncounty seat to county seat. At Hiawatha he and the late Gov. E. N.\r\nMorrill were close friends, kept “bach” together, and had the usual\r\nquarrels as to whose turn it was to scrape the skillet.\r\n\r\nElected to the Territorial legislature, his service attracted such\r\nattention that in his absence, and without his knowledge, he was given\r\nby the Republicans the first nomination under State organization for the\r\noffice of attorney general; he was duly elected and served as the first\r\nattorney general of the newly created State. It was from his incumbency\r\nin that office that he became known as General Guthrie. He was not\r\nacceptable for military service and took no part in the Civil war except\r\nas a volunteer in the organization hastily effected to repel the\r\ninvasion of Gen. Sterling Price, which was cut off by his defeat at the\r\nbattle of Westport.\r\n\r\nSome of General Guthrie’s friends have felt that he would not have been\r\nnominated for attorney general if he had been at the convention where he\r\nwas nominated, or had known that he was to be suggested as a candidate.\r\nWhile General Guthrie subsequently served with credit in the Kansas\r\nState senate and was an influential factor in Kansas politics for many\r\nyears in the interests of others, he was not a successful politician as\r\na candidate in conventions not made up of a majority of men who\r\npersonally knew him well. He was thrice a candidate for the Republican\r\nnomination for Congress, and once nominated by one of the two factions\r\nof a convention which split up in a row and nominated two different\r\ncandidates. When it came to bodies made up of trading delegations\r\ndickering for local advantages, General Guthrie’s straightforwardness,\r\nhis aversion to crooked deals and trades, and his unwillingness to offer\r\npersonal reward for political assistance put him at a serious\r\ndisadvantage. If he thought a man or thing was wrong he never hesitated\r\nto say so, even though he understood what the results would be. It is\r\nsaid that at the last congressional convention in which he was a\r\ncandidate, and in which he was the favorite candidate, the balance of\r\nthe power was held by a delegation amenable to the allurements of\r\npromise of office, or more direct substantial and immediate reward. His\r\nless scrupulous friends tried to “dope” the General with some medicine\r\nthat would put him out of action while they used the necessary means to\r\nthe end. But the General refused to be either doped or to retire and\r\nshut his eyes to the situation, preferring an honorable defeat.\r\n\r\nGeneral Guthrie had physical as well as moral courage. Contesting the\r\ncandidacy of a former prominent citizen of Atchison who had come from\r\nanother State under a cloud, General Guthrie collected the record of\r\nthis candidate in his former home and announced that he would read it at\r\na meeting to be held in old Turner Hall. This was in the early days when\r\nAtchison had her quota of “roughneck” citizens. General Guthrie was\r\nnotified that they would attend and that he would read his documentary\r\nevidence at the peril of his life. He had never owned or carried a\r\nfirearm except during the preparation to resist the Price raid, but on\r\nthe night of the meeting he stepped out on the platform at Turner Hall,\r\nand laying upon the table a pair of old army revolvers, he looked down\r\non the “roughnecks” in the front row and advised them that he was about\r\nto proceed with his speech, and that persons who didn’t like trouble had\r\nbetter leave before it began. He made the speech. The trouble did not\r\nstart. The candidate he was opposing was defeated.\r\n\r\nFrom the time Kansas became a State until his death, General Guthrie was\r\na citizen of Atchison contemporary with that circle of brilliant and\r\nable men who in the early days made Atchison the mother of the political\r\nhistory of the State, such as Senator John J. Ingalls, Governor John A.\r\nMartin, Governor George W. Glick, United States District Judge Cassius\r\nG. Foster, Chief Justices Samuel A. Kingman and Albert H. Horton, and\r\nsuch early-day business men as David Auld, the Challiss brothers, Jacob\r\nLeu, and Samuel Hollister.\r\n\r\nAfter his election as attorney general on December 21, 1863, General\r\nGuthrie, accompanied by his friend, Chief Justice Albert H. Horton, as\r\nbest man, crossed the Missouri river to St. Joseph upon the ice,\r\ncrawling upon their hands and knees, the ice being too treacherous to\r\nsupport a man walking upright, to be married to Julia, daughter of Capt.\r\nWilliam Fowler, of St. Joseph, also a pioneer, the first county clerk in\r\nthe territory of which St. Joseph is now the county seat. There were\r\nborn of this marriage eight children, two of whom died in infancy, the\r\nothers and the wife surviving General Guthrie. W. F. Guthrie, the eldest\r\nson, practiced law with his father until about the time of the death of\r\nthe latter, when, with his wife and three children he removed to Kansas\r\nCity and is still in practice. The second son, F. L. Guthrie, a retired\r\nbanker, with wife, resides at Paola, Kan. Mary Louise Guthrie is the\r\nwife of A. E. White, head of the commissary department of the Burlington\r\nsystem, residing in Chicago, and the mother of four children. Warren W.\r\nGuthrie, Jr., practiced law in Atchison in association with his father\r\nand brother, and afterwards practiced alone until his death on August\r\n17, 1914, being one of the most beloved men personally of all the people\r\nof Atchison. Theodore F. Guthrie, also the father of four children, is,\r\nas he has been since before his father’s decease, the manager of the\r\nGuthrie ranch in Chase county, Kansas. Gilbert L. Guthrie has been the\r\nwanderer of the family, a metallurgical engineer who has seen\r\ndistinguished service on every continent of the globe, but has given up\r\nhis work to be a companion to the widow, residing on the old Guthrie\r\nhomestead adjoining Atchison.\r\n\r\nFrom the first General Guthrie became and until ill health overtook him\r\nremained a notable figure at the bar, not only of Atchison, but of the\r\nState at large, and particularly northeast Kansas, where his early\r\nsuccesses brought him in as a consultant in the territory he had\r\nformerly covered on muleback, long after that territory had developed\r\nmany able lawyers of its own. His name appears frequently in the reports\r\nof the supreme court of Kansas, and in connection with the establishment\r\nof many new and novel precedents in the courts. General Guthrie was an\r\noriginal thinker along legal lines, and not over-tolerant of the law as\r\nhe found it in the books. When it did not suit him his vigorous mind\r\nwould discern logical modifications and novel applications of old\r\ndoctrines to meet the new necessities of his litigation.\r\n\r\nEvery fight for the general good of the community found General Guthrie\r\nin the front of battle. No difficulty daunted him. All that was required\r\nfor him was to decide as to what he thought right, and his hat was in\r\nthe ring. Perhaps the greatest personal, direct service rendered by\r\nGeneral Guthrie to the community was in connection with the failure of\r\nthe Peoples Savings Bank. The Peoples Savings Bank was an auxiliary of\r\nthe United States National Bank, the closing of which was brought about\r\nby the circulation of rumors affecting its solvency. It paid its\r\nliabilities in full before it closed, but the assets of the Peoples\r\nSavings Bank were invested chiefly in real estate mortgages and bonds\r\nnot immediately payable, and as times were then, not readily\r\nconvertible, so that its closure, following that of the United States\r\nNational, left hundreds of citizens with their needed savings not\r\nimmediately realizable. General Guthrie was a holder of one share of\r\nstock only in each of these banks, for the purpose of qualifying as a\r\ndirector as an accommodation to the operating officers, his friends.\r\nThis double failure, at a time of general financial uneasiness, helped\r\nby stories circulated by enemies of the bank officials anxious to bring\r\nthem into disgrace, filled Atchison with excitement. Nightly meetings,\r\nattended by hundreds of depositors, were held, and in their ignorance\r\nmeasures were initiated which would have resulted in a sacrifice of the\r\nassets and the realization to the depositors of but a small per cent. of\r\ntheir claims. General Guthrie undertook to stem this tide and save the\r\ndepositors from themselves. He arranged with his co-directors to advance\r\na sum to buy up at face value the deposits of the smaller and more needy\r\ndepositors, and out of his own funds advanced the moneys necessary to\r\nprotect the assets from sacrifice, and lent his own uncompensated\r\nefforts to their realization at their actual value, with the result that\r\nwithin a year every claim of the bank was paid in full.\r\n\r\nLike many successful men who have been born and spent their early years\r\nupon a farm. General Guthrie was interested in farming and in farm\r\ndevelopment and in showing what could be done through proper cultivation\r\nand stock development. He left ample provision for his widow and younger\r\nchildren, chiefly in farm lands. He gave personal attention to the\r\noperation and improvement of his farms, and took particular delight in\r\nthe management of his 6,000 acre ranch in Chase county, Kansas, and in\r\nthe development of a grade of cattle originated by himself, the Polled\r\nHerefords, a strain of Herefords, from which he succeeded in breeding\r\noff the horns. Nothing gave him greater pleasure in the later years of\r\nhis life than to explain his farming and cattle operations to his\r\nfriends and intimates. He was ready to put aside the most intricate\r\nlitigation at any time for a chat on this subject.\r\n\r\nWhile General Guthrie’s open-handed warfare upon the things he thought\r\nwrong made him many enemies, his untiring energy, integrity and\r\nreadiness to help anyone or anything he believed to be right, brought\r\nhim a host of friends, not only among the young lawyers he raised and\r\ntrained, but among the public at large, and he died an honored and\r\nrespected member of this community on April 22, 1903, at the old home\r\nplace adjoining the city of Atchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOHN PETER ADAMS.\r\n\r\nFaithfulness to duty is generally recognized and rewarded by the people\r\nof an average American community. Atchison county is singularly\r\nfortunate in having as its officials men of whom it can be said are\r\nabove the average type of county officials. The office of probate judge\r\nof the county is no exception, and is ably filled by the present\r\nincumbent of whom this biography treats. John Peter Adams is an able\r\nmember of the Atchison county bar and a painstaking and conscientious\r\npublic official. In the performance of the duties of his high office he\r\nhas won the esteem of the people of the county and showed such marked\r\nability in his judicial capacity that he was elected to the office for\r\nthe third time without opposition from any source.\r\n\r\nJudge John Peter Adams was born in the town of Lock Berlin, Wayne\r\ncounty, New York, June 7, 1855. His parents were Peter and Martha\r\n(Eldridge) Adams, and Judge Adams was one of six children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM A. JACKSON,\r\n  Judge District Court.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHARLES J. CONLON,\r\n  County Attorney.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHN PETER ADAMS,\r\n  Judge of Probate Court.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ROY C. TRIMBLE,\r\n  Sheriff.\r\n]\r\n\r\nJudge Adams received his early education in the schools of his native\r\nState and the Macedon Academy, following which he completed a business\r\ncourse at the Eastman Business College, Poughkeepsie, N. Y. He\r\npractically worked his way through school by teaching, becoming a\r\nteacher at the early age of eighteen. He came to Atchison in 1879 and\r\nentered the law office of Judge H. M. Jackson, as a law student, and was\r\nadmitted to the practice of law in 1880. A short time following his\r\nadmission to the bar he opened an office for himself, and later became a\r\npartner with Roy C. Crawford. A partnership with Charles J. Conlon was\r\nformed some time afterward, which continued until the election of Mr.\r\nAdams to the office of probate judge in 1910. Judge Adams was reëlected\r\nin 1912, and again in 1914, without opposition for the nomination or\r\nelection. He is a Republican and a firm believer in a high protective\r\ntariff. Previous to his election to the probate judgeship, he served as\r\njudge of the Atchison city court, having been appointed by Governor\r\nBailey in 1902, and reëlected three times following his appointment\r\nwithout opposition. Judge Adams has always earnestly advocated\r\nRepublican principles and has been a faithful party worker.\r\n\r\nJudge Adams was married in Albion, Mich., June 24, 1885, to Mary\r\nStevens, a native of Lock Berlin, N. Y., and a daughter of Wells J. L.\r\nand Nancy Stevens. To Judge and Mrs. Adams have been born three\r\nchildren, who are the pride of their parents, as follows: Eldridge, born\r\nNovember 30, 1892. He received his classical education in Kansas\r\nUniversity and graduated in medicine from Rush Medical College at\r\nChicago in 1914, after a thorough course of study in the University of\r\nChicago, now a practicing physician and surgeon in the Illinois State\r\nHospital for eye, nose and throat, at Chicago. Dr. Adams is a rising\r\nyoung physician of marked ability and was an apt student, and is\r\nambitious to succeed in his chosen profession. He graduated from the\r\nAtchison High School at the age of fifteen, from the Kansas University\r\nat the age of nineteen, and received his Doctor of Medicine degree from\r\nRush College of Medicine when but twenty-three years of age. It is safe\r\nto predict a brilliant future for this Atchison boy. A daughter of Judge\r\nAdams, Eleanor, aged twenty, is a student of Knox College, Galesburg,\r\nIll., class of 1916, where she is specializing in music—violin and\r\nvoice. Genevra, the youngest child of Judge and Mrs. Adams, is eighteen\r\nyears old, a graduate of the Atchison High School, and a student in\r\nBaker University. The Adams family has resided in the same house at\r\nFourth and Laramie streets for thirty years, or since the marriage of\r\nJudge and Mrs. Adams. They believe in giving their children the\r\nadvantages of a good education, as the best preparation possible for\r\ntheir future success.\r\n\r\nJudge Adams was reared in the Episcopalian faith, which was the church\r\nof his fathers, but is an attendant with the members of his family at\r\nthe Methodist Episcopal church. He became a member of the Masonic lodge\r\nin 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WILLIAM ANTHONY JACKSON.\r\n\r\nWhile we reverence the courts and look upon them as the final refuge of\r\nthe citizenry in time of oppression or trouble, we realize that the\r\ntribunals of the people for safeguarding our inalienable rights as\r\ncitizens are measured in their usefulness by the character of the men\r\nchosen to sit at the head of the judiciary. Society is protected from\r\nthose criminally inclined, and we accept without criticism the decisions\r\nof the judges with whom we come into personal contact, because of the\r\nfact that the masses of the people have an abiding faith in the\r\nintegrity of the courts. This confidence is more in evidence in a\r\ncommunity where all have an opportunity of judging at close range the\r\nqualifications and personal integrity of those chosen by the people to\r\nadminister the judicial affairs of the people. It is meet and necessary\r\nthat the judges in whom we place implicit confidence be men of the\r\nhighest calibre, broad-minded and sympathetic in dealing firmly with the\r\nmany diverse cases which are brought before them for adjudication. The\r\ndistrict court of Atchison county is presided over by a learned jurist\r\nwho has the confidence and esteem of the people, and who enjoys the\r\nuniversal respect of the citizens of the county. Hon. William A.\r\nJackson, judge of the district court of Atchison county, is such a man\r\nwisely chosen to fill the highest office within the gift of the people\r\nin his district. His career as presiding officer of the court has been\r\nmarked by a display of ability, legal acumen, broad-minded and\r\nsympathetic discernment of right and wrong in handing down his decisions\r\nthat have satisfied the most exacting. He was born in Versailles, Morgan\r\ncounty, Missouri, October 6, 1866. He is a son of Judge Horace M. and\r\nLavanchia Isabelle (Valentine) Jackson, a review of whose life is given\r\nin this volume.\r\n\r\nJudge Jackson has a reputation for fairness and impartiality in his\r\njudicial decisions which has gone far beyond the borders of his county.\r\nThe Atchison _Daily Champion_ in its issue of September 25, 1913, has\r\nthis to say of his high honor and integrity:\r\n\r\n“In these days of alleged lawless lawyers and corrupted courts it is a\r\ngood thing to know that Atchison county has an honest and efficient\r\njudge to administer justice from the district bench. Many big men,—men\r\nof splendid qualifications and sterling integrity—have occupied the\r\nimportant position now held by Judge Jackson, but never before has this\r\ncounty had a judge whose service on the bench commanded more universal\r\nsatisfaction than that rendered by Judge Jackson. It is the unanimous\r\nopinion of the Atchison bar that he is the best district judge in the\r\nState. Absolutely fair, impartial, capable, he performs the functions of\r\nhis office with a high sense of duty and responsibility to the law and\r\nto his fellow men, a duty and responsibility which precludes all other\r\nresults, save only unqualified justice for each case that comes under\r\nhis supervision.”\r\n\r\nThe supreme test which could be applied to a man in his position came on\r\nan occasion when the father and brother of Judge Jackson appeared for\r\nthe defendant in a case which was tried in the Atchison court with Judge\r\nJackson on the bench, and he was not found wanting. Quoting from the\r\nAtchison _Daily Champion_ in its issue of April 19, 1909, concerning\r\nthis unique situation and the conduct of Judge Jackson during the course\r\nof the trial of the case:\r\n\r\n“Many people have attended court the past week as witnesses, jurors and\r\nspectators in the Norris-Mapes trial, and the fact was freely commented\r\nupon that the appearance in the trial of father and son as attorneys for\r\nthe defendant and another son was on the bench, presented a situation\r\nthat was quite unusual. Some at first indulged in unfriendly criticism\r\nof the circumstances and it is therefore a pleasure for the _Champion_\r\nto say that it has heard nothing but the most universal praise for the\r\nfairness, the impartiality and the splendid integrity of purpose Judge\r\nJackson displayed in his rulings on every disputed question of law and\r\nevidence in the case. It is a fact worthy of comment that the _Champion_\r\ntakes pleasure at this time in giving public recognition to so important\r\na matter. There is nobody in Atchison who has a stronger following of\r\nloyal friends than Will Jackson, and it is because of his manhood, his\r\nhonesty and fine sense of honor that he has earned them and retains\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Anthony Jackson was trundled in a home-made baby-cart and\r\ndressed in clothing spun and made by his devoted mother. Few were the\r\nluxuries in which he was indulged; the plainest of fare was his\r\nsustenance during his childhood days. In 1870 he was placed in school at\r\nMarysville, Mo., and after coming to Atchison with his parents he\r\nattended the city schools. He attended the Monroe Institute and later\r\nentered Kansas University at Lawrence, graduating therefrom in 1888. He\r\nwas admitted to the bar and in 1889 was made a member of the law firm of\r\nJackson & Jackson. His success in the practice of his profession has\r\nbeen marked and he is widely known as a capable lawyer and jurist. His\r\nfirst public office was that of city attorney, to which he was elected\r\nin April, 1905, and served until 1909. During the four years of his\r\nincumbency of the office of city attorney he lost but one case which\r\ncame up for trial under his care for the city. He was elected judge of\r\nthe district court, second judicial district, in November of 1908, and\r\nresigned the office of city attorney to take up his duties on the bench\r\nin order to qualify in January, 1909. His career on the bench speaks for\r\nitself and the fairness of his decisions is proverbial. Judge Jackson is\r\nremarked frequently for his kindness of heart, and soon after he was\r\nadmitted to the bar the opportunity came to him to “return good for\r\nevil” in one particular case. A lad with whom he had come into contact\r\non the school ground at Marysville, and who had tried to impose on him,\r\nwith the result that strained feeling existed for many years between\r\nthem was the beneficiary of his goodness. This lad, then grown to man’s\r\nestate, came to the judge in Atchison and asked him to assist him in\r\ngetting employment. The judge did so and earned the thanks of his\r\nboyhood enemy.\r\n\r\nJudge Jackson’s wedded life began April 26, 1894, when he was united in\r\nmarriage with Edith Fox, of Atchison. To this union have been born two\r\nchildren: Jared Fox Jackson, born November 19, 1895, and now a student\r\nin the law department of Kansas University; Edward Valentine Jackson,\r\nborn June 6, 1900, a student in the Atchison High School. The mother of\r\nthese children is a daughter of Jared Copeland. (See sketch of Jared\r\nCopeland Fox elsewhere in this volume.)\r\n\r\nJudge Jackson is fraternally affiliated with the Masonic Lodge,\r\nWashington, No. 5, of Atchison, the Knights of Pythias, the Elks, the\r\nFraternal Order of Eagles, and the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity of the\r\nKansas State University. He is a liberal contributor to charitable and\r\nreligious denominations, and is usually found in the van of all projects\r\nwhich have for their purpose the betterment of his home city and county.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ROY C. TRIMBLE.\r\n\r\nIn Roy C. Trimble, sheriff of Atchison county, the people have an\r\nefficient and capable public official, who believes that his duties are\r\nparamount over all other considerations, and he has shown by his\r\nsteadfast and unswerving loyalty to the ethics of his office that he is\r\na man eminently fitted for high public office. Mr. Trimble is a young\r\nman to hold such an important office, but is old in ability and\r\nexperience. He is a native of Atchison county, and a son of James M. and\r\nMargaret E. (McCreary) Trimble.\r\n\r\nRoy C. Trimble was born August 11, 1877, on a farm, four miles southwest\r\nof Atchison. His father, James M. Trimble, was born September 10, 1843,\r\nin Buchanan county, Missouri, and died in January, 1910, in Atchison\r\ncounty. He was the son of Benjamin F. Trimble, a native of Kentucky, who\r\nimmigrated to DeKalb, Mo., where he conducted a blacksmith and wagon\r\nrepair shop, and later removed to Texas. After a residence of some years\r\nin Texas he settled in Atchison county, where the son, James M., bought\r\na farm which he cultivated until 1905, when he disposed of his land and\r\ninvested in a livery business. He was thus engaged until his death.\r\nDuring the Civil war, Mr. Trimble was enrolled in the State militia.\r\nBenjamin F. Trimble was one of the early pioneer settlers of Atchison\r\ncounty and owned a farm near Effingham. The children of James M. Trimble\r\nare J. P., a railway mail clerk on the Central Branch railroad; A. F., a\r\nrural mail carrier; K. S., a farmer, south of Atchison; E. S., a\r\nresident of Lake Ballinger, Wash.; Roy C., and T. O., a ranchman, near\r\nSeattle. Wash.\r\n\r\nThe mother of the foregoing children was Margaret E. McCreary, born in\r\n1850 and died in 1890. She was a daughter of Solomon McCreary, a pioneer\r\nsettler of Atchison county, who had a farm eight and one-half miles\r\nsouth of Atchison. Solomon McCreary was born in Clay county, Missouri,\r\nin 1822, and died in July, 1911. He was a son of Elijah McCreary, and\r\nwas the youngest of a family of thirteen children. The family is of\r\nScotch-Irish ancestry, and originally settled in South Carolina. S. K.\r\ncame to Kansas in 1854, first settling in Leavenworth county, and four\r\nyears later moving to Atchison county. He bought a land patent from a\r\nMexican war veteran, and made his home on the pioneer farm until his\r\ndeath. His children were as follows: Mrs. B. Frank Trimble, Mrs.\r\nMargaret Trimble, deceased; Mrs. Nellie Adams; Cora, deceased; W. S.,\r\ndeceased; Mrs. Nettie Perkins, Leavenworth; S. K., and Mrs. Grace\r\nSalmon, of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nRoy C. Trimble was educated in the district school No. 5, located south\r\nof the city, and resided on the farm until 1905 when he was engaged in\r\nthe livery business with his father, continuing until the latter’s\r\ndeath, after which he conducted the business for a few years and then\r\ntraded it for some real estate. He was first a candidate for sheriff in\r\n1912 on the Republican ticket, but lost out by 288 votes. He was again a\r\ncandidate in 1914 and won by the considerable margin of 700 votes.\r\n\r\nSheriff Trimble was married November 2, 1904, to May Florence Hartman,\r\nwho was born near Purcell, seven miles southwest of Atchison, and is a\r\ndaughter of Ex-Sheriff F. C. Hartman, now deceased. To Mr. and Mrs.\r\nTrimble have been born the following children: Guy Roy, born August 7,\r\n1905; Cynthia Grace, born May 2, 1907; Clara May, born May 10, 1913, and\r\nHenrietta Gale, born June 4, 1915.\r\n\r\nMr. Trimble and wife are members of the Presbyterian church. He is\r\nfraternally affiliated with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the\r\nFraternal Aid. Mr. Trimble is likeable, and has a winning personality\r\nwhich goes far toward making him a successful and popular official. Such\r\nencomiums and praise as have come to him for his conduct of the duties\r\nof the sheriff’s office are well deserved and he is constantly widening\r\nhis circle of friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHARLES J. CONLON.\r\n\r\nCharles J. Conlon, a prominent attorney of Atchison, who is now serving\r\nhis second term as county attorney, is a native of the Empire State. He\r\nwas born at Orwell, Oswego county, New York, October 31, 1860, and is a\r\nson of James and Anna (Bowen) Conlon, the former a native of New York\r\nand the latter of Ireland. Anna Bowen, the mother, came to America with\r\nher parents, William and Nancy Bowen, when she was thirteen years of\r\nage. James Conlon was born in Oneida county, New York, and was a son of\r\nCharles Conlon, a native of Ireland, who immigrated to America in 1814\r\nand settled in Oneida county, New York, where he spent the remainder of\r\nhis life. James Conlon grew to manhood in Oneida county, and in 1859 was\r\nmarried and about a year later removed to Oswego county, bought a farm\r\nand followed farming there until 1867. He then returned to Oneida\r\ncounty, where he remained until 1870, when he came to Kansas, locating\r\nin Atchison county. He bought a farm about a mile and one-half southwest\r\nof the city of Atchison, where he was successfully engaged in farming\r\nand stock raising until about a year prior to his death, November 1,\r\n1899, at the age of seventy-three. He was a very successful farmer and a\r\nhighly respected citizen, and at the time of his death owned 200 acres\r\nof valuable land, which is still owned by the Conlon family. He was a\r\nlife-long Democrat and a member of the Catholic church. His wife died\r\nSeptember 22, 1898, aged sixty-three years. They were the parents of the\r\nfollowing children: Anna M. married Peter Donovan, now deceased, and\r\nthree children were born to this union, Peter, Fredrick and Charles, and\r\nafter the death of her first husband, Anna M. married John McInteer, who\r\nis also now deceased and she resides in Atchison; Charles J., the\r\nsubject of this sketch; William H. resides on the old homestead; John\r\nF., farmer, Atchison; James D., plumber, St. Louis, Mo.; Letitia M.\r\nMcKenna, Denver, Colo., and Fred J. died in Atchison at the age of\r\nthirty-three years. He was a machinist and well and favorably known in\r\nAtchison county. Charles J. Conlon was educated in the public schools,\r\nSt. Benedict’s College, Atchison, Kan., and Whitestown Seminary,\r\nWhitestown, N. Y., graduating from the latter institution in the class\r\nof 1882. He then entered the law department of the University of\r\nMichigan, at Ann Arbor, Mich., and was graduated in the class of 1884\r\nwith the degree of Bachelor of Laws. He then engaged in the practice of\r\nhis profession at Atchison, Kan., and has continued in the practice to\r\nthe present time. He was elected county attorney of Atchison county in\r\n1912 and reëlected to succeed himself in 1914. Mr. Conlon is a capable\r\nlawyer and is a fair and fearless prosecutor. Mr. Conlon was united in\r\nmarriage February 14, 1903, to Miss Mae Flanigan, a native of Oswego\r\ncounty, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOHN F. CONLON.\r\n\r\nJohn F. Conlon, farmer, was born October 15, 1865, in the town of\r\nOrwell, Oswego county, New York. He was educated in the common schools\r\nof his native town and later attended the Whitestown Seminary at\r\nWhitestown, N. Y. After coming to Atchison county, Kansas, in 1885 with\r\nhis parents, he studied at St. Benedict’s College. He remained with his\r\nparents on the home farm southwest of Atchison until their death, and\r\nmanaged the estate for several years thereafter successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THOMAS O. GAULT.\r\n\r\nPersonal achievements of the individual are always worth recounting when\r\nhe has accomplished something worth while. There is considerable\r\nsatisfaction in the latter years of the life of an industrious couple,\r\nwho, having begun at the foot of the ladder of success and having\r\nclimbed upward by degrees, have attained to a state of wealth and\r\ncomfort by the time middle age has been reached. Thomas O. Gault and his\r\nwife, residing in a beautiful farm home in the northeast part of the\r\ncity of Effingham, are among the most respected citizens of Atchison\r\ncounty. Mr. Gault is one of the large land owners of the county, and\r\nwhile not an old resident he can lay claim to the fact that he was a\r\nhomesteader in Kansas back in the “grasshopper” era, and has had as many\r\nups and downs as the average western pioneer.\r\n\r\nThomas O. Gault was born November 7, 1849, in Wycomico county, Maryland,\r\na son of Archibald and Eliza (Littleton) Gault, natives of Maryland, and\r\ndescendants of old American colonial families. The ancestry of the Gault\r\nand Littleton families dates back to the earliest days of the settlement\r\nof the eastern coast of America. Archibald was the son of Obid Gault,\r\nwho was a soldier in the War of 1812, and was an early pioneer settler\r\nof Indiana. Eliza Littleton was a daughter of Thomas Littleton, and died\r\nwhen Thomas O. was seven years of age. Archibald Gault emigrated from\r\nMaryland to Ripley county, Indiana, about 1859, and settled on a farm\r\nsouth of Pierce City, or near Stringtown. This was in a timbered\r\ncountry, and he lived there only three years, returning to Maryland\r\nduring the dark days of the Civil war, where he remained until the war\r\nwas over. In 1865 he returned to his farm in Ripley county, and\r\ncultivated his Indiana farm until old age overtook him, and he finally\r\nreturned to the old home in Maryland, there spending his declining\r\nyears, dying in 1900, at the age of eighty years.\r\n\r\nThomas O. Gault was educated in the district schools of Ripley county,\r\nIndiana, and began working at the hardest kind of farm labor when yet a\r\nboy. When he attained his majority he came to the great West, where\r\nopportunity seemed to beckon with a more lavish hand than among the\r\nhills and forests of his native county and State. He located in Jasper\r\ncounty, Iowa, and worked at farm labor until twenty-five years of age,\r\nthen came to Kansas and homesteaded a Government claim in Phillips\r\ncounty. This was a sad experience, however, as the grasshoppers came\r\nalong soon afterwards and “cleaned out” the crops of the homesteaders in\r\nhis neighborhood, and he abandoned his claim and left the country. He\r\nreturned to Jasper county, Iowa, in 1873, where he remained for three\r\nyears, after which he remained in Iowa, locating in Pottawattamie county\r\nin 1878, where he had purchased a farm. He and his wife developed the\r\nfarm and prospered for a period of fourteen years. Selling out their\r\nIowa farm at a good round price in 1903, they located in Effingham,\r\nwhere they have resided since March of 1903. Mr. Gault invested his\r\ncapital in Kansas and Missouri lands and has made money since he came to\r\nKansas. Being gifted with the moneymaking instinct and capacity, he has\r\ndealt somewhat in land and been successful in his farming operations in\r\nAtchison county. He is the owner of an eighty acre tract of valuable\r\nland, purchased in 1902, adjoining Effingham, Kan., on the northeast,\r\nand has one of the most attractive modern farm homes in the county. He\r\nowns at the present time a total of 582.5 acres of land, 262.5 acres of\r\nwhich is located in Grundy county, Missouri, and the rest in Atchison\r\ncounty. He has a large farm of 240 acres near Pardee in Center township,\r\nwhich is one of the best improved tracts in the vicinity. This farm was\r\npurchased in 1902 and is equipped with excellent buildings, including a\r\nhouse of twelve rooms and three good barns.\r\n\r\nHe was married on March 4, 1888, to Miss Melissa Drury, of the town of\r\nDrury, Rock Island county, Illinois. They are the parents of two\r\nchildren: Essie, at home with her parents, and Pearl, wife of William\r\nThomas, a son of Robert M. Thomas, of Effingham. Mrs. Gault was born\r\nMarch 4, 1861, in Drury, Rock Island county, Illinois, a daughter of Eli\r\nand Margaret (Hubbard) Drury, natives of Wayne county, Indiana, and\r\nBedford county, Pennsylvania, respectively. Mr. Drury served as\r\npostmaster of the village named in his honor in Rock Island county for\r\nthirty-five years, and was filling the office at the time of his death,\r\nin 1892.\r\n\r\nMr. Gault is a stockholder in the Farmer’s Mercantile Company of\r\nEffingham. He is a Republican in politics, but is an independent voter,\r\nwho believes in doing his own thinking as regards the merits of\r\nrespective candidates for office and the principles which influence good\r\ngovernment. He became an Odd Fellow in Marshall county, Iowa, in the\r\nearly eighties, and has continued in good standing in the order to the\r\npresent time. One of the incidents of his early career which left an\r\nimpression on Mr. Gault’s memory, which time has never been able to\r\neradicate, was his first Kansas experience. He was so thoroughly cleaned\r\nout during the great grasshopper scourge in the seventies, in Phillips\r\ncounty, Kansas, that he was forced to walk the entire distance from Blue\r\nRiver, Kan., to Atchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WILFULL A. STANLEY.\r\n\r\nWilfull A. Stanley, a Civil war veteran, who perhaps has had more\r\nmilitary experience than any other man in Atchison county, is a native\r\nof New Jersey. He was born at Salem, November 26, 1838, and is a son of\r\nJoseph C. and Rebecca D. (Gosline) Stanley, both natives of New Jersey\r\nand descendants of colonial ancestors, who trace their family genealogy\r\nback for several generations in this country. The first white child born\r\nin the English colony that settled in New Jersey, opposite Egg Harbor,\r\nwas an ancestor of Wilfull A. Stanley. Joseph C. Stanley, the father of\r\nWilfull A., was a son of Friend Richard Stanley, who was a soldier in\r\nthe War of 1812. The Stanley’s were Quakers, but there were a great many\r\nfighting Quakers distributed along the line of descent. Friend Richard\r\nwas a son of John Stanley, who was a Revolutionary soldier and served in\r\nLighthorse Harry Lee’s cavalry. He was captured and confined in a\r\nBritish prison ship for some time. He lived to be a very old man and\r\ndied in 1845, at the age of 102. He was very active physically and\r\nmentally to a very old age. Wilfull A. Stanley was reared in New Jersey\r\nand received a common school education. On December 22, 1860, he\r\nenlisted as a private in the United States marine; and after making a\r\ntrip around the world was detailed in 1861 as orderly to Admiral\r\nDahlgren at Washington, D. C. He also served as orderly to Commanding\r\nOfficer C. R. P. Rogers. Mr. Stanley was at the taking of Hatteras Inlet\r\nand the operations on Roanoke Sound in conjunction with General\r\nBurnside’s expedition. He was at the engagement of Port Royal and served\r\nas orderly to Capt. C. R. P. Rogers there. He was also at the engagement\r\nat Ft. Walker. The “Wabash,” upon which he was serving then, joined\r\nAdmiral Farragut’s fleet at New Orleans. Here Mr. Stanley was\r\ntransferred to the “Hartford,” Admiral Farragut’s flag ship, and served\r\nas orderly to Farragut and participated in the engagements at Fts.\r\nJackson and Phillip, and was at the capture of New Orleans when he was\r\nagain detailed to the “Wabash.” Shortly after that he was taken sick\r\nwith a fever and sent to the marine hospital at Brooklyn, N. Y. After\r\nrecovering he was discharged, and with his discharge received a very\r\ncomplimentary letter from Admiral Rogers. After remaining home a short\r\ntime he enlisted in the Second regiment, New Jersey cavalry. He\r\nparticipated in the battle of Nashville and was at the siege of Mobile.\r\nHe went from there to Montgomery, Ala. About this time the war closed,\r\nbut Mr. Stanley’s regiment was kept in the South for nearly a year\r\nduring the reconstruction period, and in 1866 he was discharged and\r\nreturned to his New Jersey home. Mr. Stanley had learned the plasterer’s\r\ntrade when he was a young man and at the close of the war worked at it\r\nfor some time, when the military spirit took possession of him again and\r\nhe enlisted at Philadelphia, Pa., and was assigned to Troop L, Seventh\r\nUnited States cavalry, and was sent from Ft. Leavenworth to Ft. Morgan\r\non the Platte river. Capt. Michael V. Sheridan, a brother of “Little\r\nPhil,” commanded this troop and they were mobilized at Ft. Hayes for a\r\nwinter campaign against the Indians in the Wichita mountains. This\r\ncampaign was against the Arapahoes, Comanches and some other tribes.\r\nAfter an engagement with Lone Wolf’s band the soldiers were forced to\r\nretreat, but soon after were re-inforced at Big Timber by a Kansas\r\nregiment, and after that captured Lone Wolf and Satanta, chief of the\r\nKiawas, and returned the Indians who had been on the war path to the Ft.\r\nSill reservation. After that Mr. Stanley returned to Ft. Leavenworth and\r\nhad charge of the hospital stores for two years, when he was transferred\r\nto Wingate, N. M., where he also had charge of the hospital stores until\r\n1872, when he was discharged and returned to New Jersey. In 1889 he came\r\nto Kansas, locating in Atchison, where he has since worked at his trade\r\nmost of the time. He had lived in Philadelphia for some time and in\r\nGeorgetown, S. C. before coming to Kansas, and came to this State on\r\naccount of his wife’s health. Mr. Stanley was married in 1877 to Mrs.\r\nMary E. (Ingram) Fpuntain, a widow. She is a native of Bellefont, Pa.,\r\nborn June 25, 1842, a daughter of Isaac D. and Deborah (Grant) Ingram,\r\nnatives of Pennsylvania and descendants of old Pennsylvania stock.\r\nJoshua Bloomfield Williams, a major in the Revolutionary war, and at one\r\ntime colonial governor of New Jersey, was a grand-uncle of Mrs.\r\nStanley’s mother, and Mrs. Stanley is a Daughter of the American\r\nRevolution. She is a member of the Ladies’ Corps of the Grand Army of\r\nthe Republic, and is past department president of Kansas, and National\r\npress correspondent, and has filled all the offices from the local\r\ncircle to the National. Mr. and Mrs. Stanley have one child, Leon Glen,\r\nborn in 1881. He served in Troop B, Sixth United States cavalry. He was\r\nin China at the rescue of the foreign legations and suppression of the\r\nBoxer uprising and later served in the Phillipine Islands, and after\r\nthree years’ service he was honorably discharged. He was the first post\r\nprinter at Ft. Leavenworth, and is now in the employ of the _Atchison\r\nGlobe_, in the capacity of pressman and mailing clerk. He married Sadie\r\nWiggins, and two children have been born to them, as follows: Inez Leona\r\nand Richard. Wilfull A. Stanley is a member of the Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic and has been adjutant of the Atchison post for ten years and is\r\npast commander.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHRISTIAN W. STUTZ.\r\n\r\nChristian W. Stutz, a substantial farmer of Center township, Atchison\r\ncounty, was born and reared in Lancaster township, this county, and is a\r\nson of pioneer settlers of the county. The Stutz family came to Kansas\r\nfrom Missouri in 1859. Christian W. is a son of Christian and Catharine\r\n(Schweitzer) Stutz, both of whom were born in Germany from whence they\r\ncame to America in 1855, and first settled in Jackson county, Missouri,\r\ncoming from there to Lancaster township in Atchison county four years\r\nlater. Christian, the father, was born in Germany, March 25, 1825, and\r\nwhen thirty years of age decided to locate in the new country where\r\nthere were better opportunities for gaining a livelihood and laying up a\r\ncompetence. Accordingly, we find that after a residence of four years in\r\nJackson county, Missouri, he came to Atchison county, and with his\r\nsavings invested in eighty acres of timber and prairie land in Lancaster\r\ntownship. He hired a man to break this land with ox teams, and proceeded\r\nto cultivate his land. He made extensive improvements on his farm from\r\ntime to time as he was able, and added to his acreage to such an extent\r\nthat at the time of his death, December, 1898, he was the owner of 380\r\nacres of land. Christian Stutz was the father of seven children as\r\nfollows: Mrs. Caroline Demel, of Central City, Neb.; Mrs. Katherine\r\nWilkins, of Atchison, Kan.; Frederick, a member of the Atchison police\r\nforce; Christian W.; Gustave, a prosperous farmer of Lancaster township;\r\nJohn, a farmer in Center township; one child died in infancy. The mother\r\nof these children was born in Germany in February of 1829, and died in\r\nLancaster township, in December, 1888.\r\n\r\nChristian W. Stutz, whom this review directly concerns, was reared on\r\nthe old home place of the Stutz family in Lancaster township, and\r\neducated in the Lancaster school. He assisted his father in the\r\noperation of the home farm until he was twenty-three years of age, and\r\nthen began farming for himself on land which he rented from his father.\r\nHe continued to till the rented land for four years, all the time saving\r\nhis earnings, with a view of eventually owning a farm of his own. He\r\nmade his first investment in 1891 when he purchased and inherited,\r\npartly, eighty acres of improved farm land in section 8, Center\r\ntownship. He at once began to remodel the home and make extensive\r\nimprovements, and it might be said that he has never ceased to improve\r\nhis surroundings. In 1908 he erected a new barn, 50×50 feet, and now has\r\none of the attractive places of his township and county. Mr. Stutz has\r\ncontinued to add to his land holdings until he is now the owner of 393\r\nacres of land, all of which he has secured through his own efforts.\r\nDuring 1915 he had planted 160 acres to corn which gave him an excellent\r\ncrop. He keeps good graded stock and maintains a herd of Shorthorn\r\ncattle. He has made quite a reputation as a breeder, and in 1914\r\nexhibited a “Mahrath Jack” at the Atchison county fair which was awarded\r\nthe second prize. In addition to his farming interests he is a share\r\nholder in a copper mine located in Arizona.\r\n\r\nMr. Stutz was married in 1891 to Kathrine Walz, and of this union have\r\nbeen born ten children, as follows: Charles F., William, John E., Clara,\r\na graduate of the Atchison County High School; Arthur, Mary and Margaret\r\n(twins), the latter deceased; Francis, Nora B., Reidel, all of whom are\r\nat home with their parents. Mrs. Stutz was born September 8, 1868, in\r\nAtchison, Kan., a daughter of Charles and Kathrine (Reidel) Walz, both\r\nnatives of Germany. Charles Walz emigrated from Germany to Cincinnati,\r\nOhio, and there learned the butcher business and trade. When nineteen\r\nyears of age he left Germany to seek his fortune in America, and about\r\n1857 came to Atchison and worked in the first butcher shop ever operated\r\nin that city. He later bought the shop of Phillip Link, and after\r\noperating it for a time bought a farm in Shannon township, where he\r\nlived until his death, in 1891, at the age of sixty-one years. Kathrine,\r\nhis wife, was born in 1842, and died on the old home place in Shannon\r\ntownship.\r\n\r\nMr. Stutz is a Democrat, but has never sought political preferment,\r\nhaving no time other than for the management of his large farming\r\ninterests. He is fraternally connected with the Odd Fellows and the\r\nFraternal Order of Eagles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MICHAEL JOSEPH HORAN.\r\n\r\nIn observing the management of the leading commercial houses of\r\nAtchison, the fact is determined that, invariably, the executive\r\ndepartments are in charge of young men who have practically grown up\r\nwith the business. The Dolan Mercantile Company is one of the oldest\r\nwholesale institutions of the city, and one of the most successful and\r\nsubstantial. Its affairs are conducted by young men who entered the\r\nemploy of its founder when boys, and have advanced, step by step, in the\r\nmanagement of the concern. M. J. Horan, the president of the Dolan\r\nMercantile Company, began his career in a humble capacity in the\r\nbusiness of which he is now the chief executive, and has become an\r\nhonored and able member of the body of commercial men who have made\r\nAtchison preëminent among the cities of the West. The story of a self-\r\nmade man is always interesting and this review is a story of a self-made\r\nman.\r\n\r\nMichael Joseph Horan is a native of Atchison, born November 12, 1875. He\r\nis a son of Michael Frank Horan, a native of Bir, Kings county, Ireland,\r\nborn in 1824. The elder Horan left his native heath when a young man,\r\nwith his young wife, who died later in Atchison. He first located in\r\nPeru, Ind., and there met William Dolan in 1840. He came to Kansas in\r\n1865 and located some land at Wetmore, proved up on his homestead, and\r\none year afterward located in Atchison. Here he engaged in the real\r\nestate business, and became fairly well to do. For years he was a well\r\nknown figure in Atchison and took an active interest in Democratic\r\npolitics. He died in 1888. His second wife was Anna Dean, whom he\r\nmarried in her native county of Queens, Ireland. She was born in 1844\r\nand died in February, 1910. They were the parents of the following\r\nchildren: Mrs. John A. Reynolds, Atchison; Miss Bridget Horan, Atchison;\r\nAnna, at home; Michael Joseph, Atchison; Frank, Marshalltown, Iowa;\r\nCharles L., secretary of the Dolan Mercantile Company, and in charge of\r\nthe shipping department.\r\n\r\nM. J. Horan was educated in the parochial schools and St. Benedict’s\r\nCollege, of Atchison. At the age of sixteen years, or in 1892, he\r\nentered the employ of the Dolan Mercantile Company, as office boy. He\r\napplied himself diligently to his duties and promotion step by step\r\nfollowed, as a matter of course. His next position was that of bill\r\nclerk. This was followed by his promotion to the post of bookkeeper and\r\nthen buyer. When the company was incorporated in 1900, he was elected\r\nvice-president. He succeeded Mr. Dolan as president of the company, upon\r\nthe latter’s death in 1913.\r\n\r\nMr. Horan was united in marriage in Kansas City, Mo., with Martha Emma\r\nMalone in 1909. To them have been born four children: Michael Joseph,\r\nMary Ann, Francis and William. Mrs. Horan is a daughter of Edward\r\nMalone, formerly a resident of Atchison, and who died here, after which\r\nthe mother and all of the family except Martha Emma removed to Chicago.\r\nIn political affairs Mr. Horan is an independent Democrat, who favors\r\ngood and efficient government, and believes that it can best be obtained\r\nby good and capable officials regardless of their political adherence.\r\nHe is a member of St. Benedict’s Catholic Church, and is affiliated with\r\nthe Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and the United Commercial\r\nTravelers. Mr. Horan is recognized as one of the substantial and\r\nprogressive business men of the city, and he and his wife have many warm\r\nfriends among the best families of the city, who esteem them for their\r\nmany excellent qualities of mind and heart. Mr. Horan’s dignified and\r\ncourteous demeanor in the conduct of his business affairs has won him\r\nuniversal respect and esteem both of patrons and employes of the concern\r\nof which he is the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            RINHOLD FUHRMAN.\r\n\r\nRinhold Fuhrman, farmer and stockman, of Lancaster township, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, was born in Germany February 11, 1863. He is a son of\r\nErnest and Johanna (Gerlach) Fuhrman, and was one of twelve children\r\nborn to them. The others are as follows: Caroline Deaking, Dodge City,\r\nKan.; Louise Repstein, Jefferson county, Kansas; William, St. Joseph,\r\nMo.; Julius, Doniphan county, Kansas; Trauget, Center township, Atchison\r\ncounty; Herman, Lancaster township, Atchison county; Paul, Center\r\ntownship, Atchison county; Emma Schwope, Center township, Atchison\r\ncounty; Ernest, Atchison, Kan., and two children who died in infancy.\r\nThe father by an earlier marriage to Louise (Heine) Fuhrman had one son,\r\nCharles, a farmer and stockman of Lancaster township, Atchison county.\r\n\r\nErnest Fuhrman was born in Germany July 8, 1826, and immigrated to\r\nAmerica in 1872, settling in Atchison county, Kansas, where he bought\r\n160 acres of land in section 16, Lancaster township. This was timber and\r\nprairie land and had only a small, poorly built house on it at the time,\r\nbut during the twenty years that he owned it he built several\r\nsubstantial buildings and made numerous other improvements. He\r\neventually sold the place to his son, Herman, and then bought 160 acres\r\nin Doniphan county, where Julius lives, and moved into Lancaster where\r\nhe lived in retirement. He bought eighty acres in Center township. Five\r\nyears later he went to live with his son, Paul, to whom he sold the\r\neighty acre tract, in Center township. He died on Paul’s second farm of\r\n160 acres in Center township September 2, 1915. The mother, Johanna\r\n(Gerlach) Fuhrman, was born in Germany and resides with her daughter,\r\nEmma, in Center township, Atchison county, at the age of eighty-five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 Rinhold Fuhrman left Germany with his parents who came to\r\nAtchison county, Kansas. He was reared on his father’s farm and attended\r\nschool at Rock district No. 59, and when eighteen years of age began\r\nlife for himself as a farm hand for $15 a month and proved himself a\r\ncapable worker and later was given $20 a month, which was more than the\r\naverage farm hand was paid at that time. He worked three years as a\r\nhired hand and then rented his father’s farm for five years, and later\r\nbought it. The farm consisted of 160 acres in section 20, Lancaster\r\ntownship. He improved it considerably after he took charge of it in\r\n1899, erecting a house at a cost of $1,000, and he also built a barn\r\nwhich cost $500. He has built sheds and other improvements since and did\r\nmost of this work with his own hands. He has always been a hard worker\r\nand obtained all that he now owns by hard labor. He has a fine little\r\norchard which is in a thrifty condition. He keeps graded stock and takes\r\ngreat care to keep his animals up to the standard.\r\n\r\nOn October 8, 1890, he married Emma Kammer, a native of Lancaster\r\ntownship, who was born April 18, 1868. She attended school at Rock\r\ndistrict and is a daughter of Karl and Johanna Kammer. She has a\r\nbrother, Karl, who is a farmer in Atchison county. Mr. and Mrs. Fuhrman\r\nare the parents of three children, as follows: Mrs. Laura August Poos,\r\nLee’s Summit, Mo.; Edna and Karl, both living at home. Mr. Fuhrman is a\r\nRepublican and he and his wife are members of the Evangelical church. He\r\nis a conscientious, hard working farmer who has deservedly attained\r\nsuccess. In March, 1916, Mr. and Mrs. Fuhrman left the farm and retired\r\nto a home in Lancaster, where Mr. Fuhrman purchased a residence. He has\r\nrented his farm after accumulating a competence which will enable him to\r\nlive in comfort the remainder of his days.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOHN E. REMSBURG.\r\n\r\nThe past half century has witnessed the transformation of the section of\r\nKansas known to the world as Atchison county from wilderness to a\r\nsmiling and peaceful land of thriving towns and cities and checkered\r\nwith fertile farms, a development which has been duplicated many times\r\nover in the great State of Kansas. While this wonderful transformation\r\nwas going on as the handiwork of man—particular individuals from out of\r\nthe mass of men who were working wonders in giving to this Nation a new\r\ncommonwealth, were likewise developing mental attributes with which they\r\nhad been gifted—statesmen, soldiers, and men of letters were in the\r\nmaking. Atchison county, Kansas, has been made famous by several\r\nillustrious sons who have achieved more than ordinary renown in the\r\nworld of letters, as well as in other lines of endeavor. John E.\r\nRemsburg, editor and publisher of the _Potter Kansan_, educator, author\r\nand lecturer, during nearly a half century of residence in the county,\r\nhas become as widely known in the realm of literature as any Kansan\r\ncitizen. He has achieved a reputation as a writer and lecturer of force\r\nwhich is world-wide and deserved by the recipient. Mr. Remsburg came to\r\nKansas from his native State of Ohio in 1868. Two years after his\r\narrival in Atchison county he was married to Miss Nora M. Eiler, of\r\nWalnut township, this county, who came with her parents from Missouri to\r\nKansas in 1855. Seven children were born to this marriage: George J.,\r\nJohn J., Reullura R., Wirt A., Charles B., and Claude A., all of whom\r\nare living, and Eugene, deceased.\r\n\r\n“The International Who’s Who,” printed in English, German, French and\r\nItalian, and published in London, Paris and New York, contains the\r\nfollowing biographical sketch of Mr. Remsburg:\r\n\r\n“John E.

Remsburg was born in Atchison county, Kansas, September 22,\r\n1871. His life has been devoted mainly to horticultural, journalistic,\r\narchaeological and historical work. He spent many years on a fruit farm,\r\nremoving to Atchison in 1892, where he engaged in newspaper work on the\r\n_Daily Champion_, the oldest newspaper in Kansas; he was a reporter,\r\ncity editor, and even did editorial work on that paper up to 1900, when\r\nhe returned to the farm on account of ill health. In 1894–95 he was\r\neditor of the _Missouri Valley Farmer_, now the leading agricultural\r\njournal west of the Mississippi. During the winter of 1905–6 he was on\r\nthe reportorial staff of the _Leavenworth Daily Post_, and editor of\r\n_Western Life_, published in that city. He has also acted as special\r\ncorrespondent of the _Leavenworth Times_, _St. Joseph Gazette_, _Kansas\r\nCity Journal_, _Topeka Mail and Breeze_, _Topeka Capital_, _Atchison\r\nGlobe_, and other well known western newspapers, besides having been an\r\neditorial contributor to many different magazines and other\r\npublications.\r\n\r\nHe has spent many years in archaeological explorations, principally in\r\nnortheastern Kansas and northwestern Missouri, has opened a number of\r\nancient mounds and identified and explored old village sites of the\r\nKansa Indians, visited by Bourgmont in 1724, and Lewis and Clark in\r\n1804, on the Missouri river. He has published a pamphlet describing one\r\nof the more important of these old villages, entitled, “An Old Kansas\r\nIndian Town on the Missouri.” In all, he has discovered and examined\r\nmore than 100 old Indian village, camp, workshop and grave sites in the\r\nregion mentioned and gathered one of the most extensive private\r\narchaeological collections ever assembled in Kansas.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 he was elected a corresponding member of the Western Historical\r\nSociety upon the unsolicited recommendation of United States Senator\r\nGeorge G. Vest, of Missouri. In 1901 he became associated with Hon. J.\r\nV. Brower, of St. Paul, Minn., in important archaeological\r\ninvestigations relative to the ancient Indian province of Quivira,\r\nvisited by Coronado in 1541, and upon the organization of the Quivira\r\nHistorical Society by Mr. Brower, he was made a life member. In 1905 he\r\nwas elected president of this society to succeed Mr. Brower, deceased.\r\nThe Quivira Historical Society erected a number of costly monuments to\r\ncommemorate historical events of Coronado’s time in Kansas.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the McLean Historical Society of Illinois at\r\nBloomington in 1909 he was elected an honorary member in recognition of\r\nhis researches regarding the Kickapoo Indians, of which tribe the McLean\r\nsociety is making a special study. He has thoroughly explored the old\r\nvillage of the Kickapoos near Ft. Leavenworth, occupied from 1832 to\r\n1854, and visited these Indians on their reservation in Brown county,\r\nKansas, on several occasions, gathering a vast amount of ethnologic and\r\nhistoric material pertaining to the tribe. He is also a member of the\r\nKickapoo Club, of Bloomington, Ill.\r\n\r\nMr. Remsburg is a member of the National Geographical Society, having\r\nbeen elected at the annual meeting of the society in Washington in 1911.\r\nHe has been a member of the International Society of Archaeologists\r\nsince its organization in 1909; was appointed an associate editor of the\r\n_Archaeological Bulletin_, official organ of this society, in 1910, and\r\nelected vice-president of the same society in the same year. In 1901 he\r\nwas elected a member of the American Society of Curio Collectors; was\r\nelected vice-president of the same in 1902, and appointed a contributing\r\neditor of the society’s official organ in 1906. He is also an active\r\nmember of and contributor to the Kansas State Historical Society, and is\r\na member of its committees on archaeology and Indian history.\r\n\r\nBrower’s “Memoirs of Explorations in the Basin of the Mississippi,”\r\nVolume VII, contains a summary account of Mr. Remsburg’s archaeological\r\nwork, and says of him: “He has long been a capable and painstaking\r\narchaeological explorer in the Missouri Valley.” Chappell’s “History of\r\nthe Missouri River” says he is an acknowledged authority on early\r\nwestern history and the archaeology of the Missouri valley.\r\n\r\nHe has held a number of local offices, such as justice of the peace,\r\nmember of school board, and secretary of various clubs and societies. He\r\nwas at one time a member of the Kansas National Guards. He is now\r\nconnected with the staff of the _Potter Weekly Kansan_ and doing special\r\ncorrespondence for several newspapers. His home is at Potter, in this\r\ncounty. He is a son of John E. Remsburg, whose sketch appears elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WIRT HETHERINGTON.\r\n\r\nHeredity, undoubtedly has an important bearing upon the choice of a life\r\nvocation for the individual citizen, and it is evident that this maxim\r\ngoverning the destiny of man himself holds good in the life of Wirt\r\nHetherington, cashier of the Exchange National Bank of Atchison. In the\r\ncity of Atchison, three generations of bankers from the Hetherington\r\nfamily have toiled in the financial activities of the city, the first of\r\nwhom was William Hetherington, grandfather of W. Wirt, the present scion\r\nof the family, engaged in banking. Following William, the pioneer banker\r\nof Atchison, and who established the first banking concern in the city,\r\ncame Webster Wirt Hetherington, father of him whose name heads this\r\nreview.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hetherington, the first of the line in Kansas, was born in the\r\ntown of Milton, Penn., May 10, 1821, and was there reared and received\r\nhis education. When he became of age he was married, at Pine Grove,\r\nPenn., to Miss Annie M. Strimphfler, who was born in Womelsdorf, Berks\r\ncounty, Pennsylvania, September 24, 1827. This marriage occurred May 9,\r\n1848, and William and his bride, shortly afterwards, became residents of\r\nPottsville, Penn., where he engaged in the operating of a flouring mill.\r\nThree children were born to them in this city, namely: Mrs. Balie P.\r\nWaggener, of Atchison; Webster Wirt and C. S. Hetherington. In 1859 they\r\nremoved to Atchison and the youngest child of the family, Mrs. William\r\nA. Otis, was born here. Mr. Hetherington first located in St. Louis,\r\nwhen he came west, later going to Kansas City, and from there to\r\nLeavenworth, Kan., where he purchased a bankrupt stock of goods, which\r\nhe hauled by wagon to Atchison in 1859. He at once established the\r\nExchange Bank, which absorbed the Kansas Valley Bank, at that time owned\r\nby Robert L. Pease. When Mr. Hetherington came into possession of the\r\nbank it was located in a basement at the corner of Third and Commercial\r\nstreets. A short time later he moved it to the building now occupied by\r\nthe water works company, and it was here that an attempt was made by the\r\noutlaw Cleveland to rob the bank, but the attempt was unsuccessful,\r\nCleveland being frightened away by some freighters who were working\r\nnearby. Some years later, Mr. Hetherington erected a bank building at\r\nthe northwest corner of Fourth and Commercial streets, which was the\r\nhome of the bank until the erection of the handsome Exchange National\r\nBank Building, two blocks further west, in 1885. In 1882 the\r\nHetherington bank was merged into a national bank, and it was known as\r\nthe Exchange National Bank, one of the successful banking concerns of\r\nthe State of Kansas. Mr. Hetherington was a man of considerable ability,\r\nwhose efforts to advance the growing city of Atchison were worth a great\r\ndeal, and he became a leading factor in the material advancement of the\r\ncity. His influence on public thought and movement was marked and it was\r\nthe more powerful, for he was largely unbiased in his judgments. He died\r\nin 1890.\r\n\r\nWebster Wirt Hetherington, father of the subject of this review, was\r\nborn in Pottsville, Penn., December 19, 1850. He was educated in Gambier\r\nCollege in Ohio, and came directly from his studies in that institution\r\nto enter the Exchange National Bank of Atchison, of which his father was\r\nthe founder and president. He became cashier of the bank, and upon his\r\nfather’s demise, in 1890, he became the president of the bank, remaining\r\nin this position until his death, January 28, 1892. Mr. Hetherington,\r\nduring his financial career, became widely known in banking circles, and\r\nhad many valuable acquaintances among New York financial men, with whom\r\nhe had many transactions in western securities. When the Rock Island\r\nroad was building in Kansas and Nebraska, Mr. Hetherington made\r\narrangements to purchase all the municipal bonds the road received from\r\nthe counties and townships through which it passed. The deal was\r\nsuccessful, and won him the confidence of the New York brokers through\r\nwhom he sold the bonds. In 1889 he received, as a reward from W. P.\r\nRice, of New York City, $10,000 in cash and also traveling expenses for\r\nhimself and wife on a tour in Europe, in payment for his services in\r\ngoing to London and assisting Mr. Rice in interesting English\r\ncapitalists in investing in American enterprises. Mr. Hetherington was\r\nmarried November 18, 1875, to Miss Lillie Miller, the oldest daughter of\r\nDr. John G. and Anna B. (Bennett) Miller, both natives of Pennsylvania.\r\nThis marriage was blessed with five children as follows: Ruthanna, wife\r\nof Dr. L. A. Todd, of St. Joseph; Mary Louise, wife of Lieut. J. G.\r\nPillow, U. S. A., of Honolulu; Webster Wirt, cashier of the Exchange\r\nNational Bank of Atchison; Gail, wife of B. R. Allen, of Atchison; Harry\r\nHale, Seattle, Wash.\r\n\r\nWirt Hetherington, third in line of the bankers of this estimable\r\nfamily, was born in Atchison, February 21, 1881, and received his\r\neducation in the public schools of the city, after which he became a\r\nstudent in the Military School at Orchard Lake, Mich., from which\r\ninstitution he was graduated in 1900. Soon after his graduation, he\r\nentered the Exchange National Bank in the capacity of receiving teller\r\nand bookkeeper, and since that time he has advanced to higher positions\r\nof trust and responsibility in this important banking institution,\r\nlearning the banking business in a thorough and painstaking manner as he\r\npassed from one position to a higher one. In 1905 he became assistant\r\ncashier, a position which he held until February, 1914, when he became\r\ncashier of the bank, of which he is also a director. Mr. Hetherington is\r\nunmarried and makes his home with his widowed mother.\r\n\r\nPolitically, Wirt Hetherington is a Democrat as were his father and\r\ngrandfather before him. He is a communicant of the Episcopalian church,\r\nwhich is the church of his forefathers, who were of English origin. He\r\nis affiliated with the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons and the\r\nBenevolent and Protective Order of Elks. Mr. Hetherington is destined to\r\nfollow in the footsteps of his able and distinguished father and\r\ngrandfather, and has already given decided evidence that he has\r\ninherited and is developing marked financial ability of a high order.\r\nHis demeanor in the conduct of the duties of his important position is\r\ncommendatory and his pleasant and courteous manner of greeting those\r\nwith whom his duties bring him in daily contact betokens the innate\r\ngentlemanly attributes which he possesses to a considerable degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HARRY L. SHARP.\r\n\r\nHarry L. Sharp, secretary of the Atchison Commercial Club, is one of the\r\n“live wires” of the city and has given evidence of great ability in his\r\nchosen profession. He is industrious, frugal, sincere and unpretending.\r\nHis accurate knowledge as to the departmental matters is a constant\r\nsurprise to those who have occasion to consult him with reference to any\r\nbranch of public service. He realizes that facts, and not theories, must\r\nbe the working forces in this organization. He is not only able,\r\nintelligent and practical in the discharge of his duties as secretary of\r\nthe Commercial Club, but is thoroughly conscientious and always shows\r\nthe courage of his convictions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Harry Sharp_,\r\n  _Sec’y Atchison Commercial Club._\r\n]\r\n\r\nHarry L. Sharp was born in Moravia, Iowa, January 14, 1883, a son of\r\nJohn Wilson and Cora Wright Sharp, who trace their ancestry to Thomas\r\nBrown and Col. William Crawford, of Pennsylvania. Thomas Brown was one\r\nof the early pioneers in western Pennsylvania and founded the town of\r\nBrownsville, that State, in the year 1776. Col. William Crawford was a\r\nconfrere of George Washington. Colonel Crawford married a daughter of\r\nThomas Brown, which closely related both sides of Mr. Sharp’s family,\r\nhis father’s people being the Crawfords and his mother’s the Browns. He\r\nwas graduated from the Moravia High School, after which he entered the\r\nrestaurant and bakery business for himself, conducting the same for a\r\nperiod of three years. Disposing of this business, he came to Atchison\r\nand was for a time associated with Sawin & Douglass in the undertaking\r\nbusiness, qualifying and obtaining a license to do embalming in the\r\nState of Kansas. Following this, he was clerk at the Byram Hotel for a\r\nperiod of three years. During the following year he wrote life insurance\r\nand resided in Hiawatha, Kan. Returning from Hiawatha, he took a\r\nposition as yard clerk in the Missouri Pacific railroad yards. From this\r\nposition he worked up to that of claim clerk for that company, which\r\nposition he resigned to become traffic manager for A. J. Harwi Hardware\r\nCompany. Upon the death of A. J. Harwi, Mr. Sharp succeeded F. E. Harwi,\r\nas buyer of the house furnishings goods department of this concern,\r\ncontinuing his traffic work. He held this position until he was tendered\r\nand accepted the secretaryship of the Atchison Commercial Club. While\r\nMr. Sharp is a Democrat, he has always been inclined to be independent\r\nin his views of things political. He is a Royal Arch Mason and a member\r\nof the Elks and Eagles and other fraternal societies. In December, 1906,\r\nMr. Sharp was married to Mary, daughter of Edward C. Wolters, a native\r\nof Germany, and a resident of Atchison, where Mr. Wolters was a\r\ncontractor for many years. Mr. and Mrs. Sharp have one child, LeRoy\r\nEdward, born May 31, 1909.\r\n\r\nMr. Sharp is one of the most capable and efficient experts in his\r\nparticular vocation that can be found in the West. He seems to be\r\nnaturally adapted for the difficult and exacting position which he\r\nholds, and is gifted with rare tact and diplomacy which is so necessary\r\nin handling the various affairs which are placed in his hands in the\r\ninterest of Atchison and the Commercial Club. He is possessed also of\r\ndecided literary ability, evidence of which talent will be readily seen\r\nin the perusal of the chapter on Atchison Industries which was written\r\nand compiled for this volume by Mr. Sharp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HENRY KUEHNHOFF.\r\n\r\nHenry Kuehnhoff, farmer and stockman, of Lancaster township, Atchison\r\ncounty, was born August 3, 1869, in Lancaster township. He is a son of\r\nCharles and Caroline Kuehnhoff, who were the parents of nine children,\r\nsix of whom are living. The father was born in Germany in 1841 and left\r\nthere when a boy of sixteen years, sailing for New York. He remained\r\nthere a short time and then went west, arriving at St. Joseph, Mo.,\r\nwhere he enlisted in Company B of the Volunteer infantry, serving in the\r\nCivil war. He was discharged at Lexington, Mo., at the close of the war,\r\nhaving made a good military record.\r\n\r\nHe returned to civil life and worked at St. Joseph, Mo., as a laborer\r\nfor $8 a month. Shortly afterward he came to Atchison county, Kansas,\r\nand bought eighty acres of land in section 10, Lancaster township. Using\r\noxen, he broke the ground on his newly acquired farm and began to\r\nimprove it as far as his resources would permit. In 1894 he retired and\r\nwent to the National Soldiers’ Home at Leavenworth, where he died in\r\n1903. The mother was born in Germany, in 1845, and died in 1899. Henry\r\nKuehnhoff grew to manhood on his father’s farm and attended the Eden\r\ndistrict school No. 37, and also attended No. 3 school for one term. He\r\nworked on the farm until he was twenty-one, and, then with his brother,\r\nWilliam, rented the old home place. At the death of his father he became\r\nheir to a share of the place, and in 1905 bought the farm where he now\r\nlives in section 9, Lancaster township, Atchison county. He now owns 157\r\nacres of well improved land and has a large amount of graded stock, and\r\nis a stockholder in a telephone company.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 he was married to Caroline Kloepper, who was born July 20, 1882,\r\nin Atchison county. She is a daughter of Crist and Caroline (Dorssom)\r\nKloepper, natives of Germany and Atchison county, respectively. The\r\nmother is now dead, but her father resides at DeKalb, Mo. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nKuehnhoff have one child, John, who lives at home. Mr. Kuehnhoff is a\r\nRepublican and a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows lodge.\r\nHe is a member of the school board of district No. 3, Lancaster\r\ntownship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MRS. D. N. WHEELER.\r\n\r\nThe average woman, left penniless, destitute, and even burdened with\r\ndebt at the hour of her greatest sorrow in life, the demise of a loved\r\nhusband, is very likely to throw herself upon the more or less doubtful\r\nmercies of friends or relatives, and make no attempt to take up the\r\nburden of gaining a livelihood by her own exertions. However, this may\r\nbe the case in many instances, but the exact opposite has been the\r\ncareer of Mrs. D. N. Wheeler, one of the wealthiest real estate\r\nproprietors in Atchison, who, during the thirty-four years that have\r\nelapsed since the demise of her husband which left her with a small home\r\nburdened with debt, and otherwise penniless, has amassed a competence\r\nwhich has placed her in the ranks of the largest individual taxpayers in\r\nthe city of Atchison.\r\n\r\nShe was born in Chautauqua county, New York, a daughter of Ezekiel and\r\nAlmirah (Trowbridge) Rooks, both of whom were natives of New York. Her\r\nfather died when she was four years of age, and she was reared in Erie\r\ncounty, Pennsylvania, where her mother removed after her father’s death.\r\nRooks county, Kansas, is named in honor of the Rooks family of New York,\r\nwho formed one of the first settlements in Rooks county, during the\r\npioneer days of the early sixties in Kansas. While a student in the\r\nacademy at Erie, Penn., she met her future husband, who was then\r\ntraveling passenger agent for the Chicago & Northwestern railway. After\r\ntheir marriage in Erie in 1869, they went to Omaha, Neb., where Mr.\r\nWheeler was connected with the Union Pacific railway. They had the honor\r\nof being the guests of George Pullman of the Pullman Car Manufacturing\r\nCompany, as passengers on the first Pullman train run over the Union\r\nPacific tracks, en route from Omaha to San Francisco. Upon their arrival\r\nin San Francisco they attended a reception at the Occidental Hotel,\r\nafter which Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler traveled in California visiting points\r\nof interest. They had some interesting experiences during their travels\r\nover the country while Mr. Wheeler was engaged in his duties in\r\nconnection with the Union Pacific railroad. S. H. H. Clark, president of\r\nthe Union Pacific railroad, was a very dear and warm friend of the\r\nWheelers, and after Mr. Wheeler’s death, she accompanied the Clark\r\nfamily to San Francisco and was domiciled at the Palace Hotel as their\r\nguest. She was with the Clarks at St. Louis when the Union Pacific\r\nrailroad was sold for $60,000,000, and she was in New York when Mr.\r\nClark signed this transfer. Mrs. Wheeler still retains the friendship of\r\nthe Clark family and frequently visits them.\r\n\r\nMr. Wheeler had charge of the expedition to North Platte when Generals\r\nGrant and Sherman made the treaty with the Indians, and Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWheeler became personally acquainted with the famous generals. A\r\nsouvenir of this experience is a pack of playing cards which General\r\nSherman gave Mrs. Wheeler when the party was on the return trip, and\r\nwhich was used in playing Bezique by the two generals to while away the\r\ntime. Mr. Wheeler was the conductor of the train which brought in the\r\nsurvivors of the Plum Creek, Neb., Indian massacre, in which many of the\r\nsettlers were killed and scalped by Indians. Mr. Wheeler died in 1881,\r\nleaving his young wife practically destitute, in the little three room\r\nhouse which they had undertaken to buy in Atchison for $600. At the time\r\nof his death there was an incumbrance of $400 on this house, and Mrs.\r\nWheeler was so poor that a load of coal which she had ordered for\r\ndelivery at the home was returned because it was thought she would be\r\nunable to pay for it. She at once began to display the spirit which has\r\nenabled her to triumph over all difficulties, and earned her living by\r\nteaching drawing and painting in the old Monroe Institute, supplementing\r\nher salary by giving private lessons at her home on Saturdays. She\r\nmanaged by dint of the strictest economy to pay off the mortgage on her\r\nlittle home, and has since remodeled it into one of the most attractive\r\nplaces in Atchison. This beautiful home is situated high up on the\r\nbluffs, bordering the Missouri river, and offers a view from the east\r\nwindows over broad reaches of the Missouri which is unsurpassed for\r\nbeauty and distance anywhere in the West. Mrs. Wheeler, while without\r\nbusiness experience of any kind whatever, at the time of her husband’s\r\ndemise, embarked upon a career of investing her savings in residence\r\nproperties until she is now the owner of twenty fairly valuable pieces\r\nof real estate in Atchison. She followed the time tried plan of the\r\ncumulative method of buying houses, which she would place in good repair\r\nfor rental purposes, going in debt for a house and then gradually paying\r\nout, and eventually buying another and so on, until she is now paying\r\ntaxes on a property valuation of over $40,000, her taxes alone amounting\r\nto $2.00 per day, or over $730 yearly. At the same time she has gained a\r\nvaluable knowledge of real estate, she has learned to know and\r\naccurately judge human nature, a combination of wisdom which is\r\nirresistible in achieving success. She is a saleswoman of great ability,\r\nand has frequently been pitted against some of the shrewdest traders in\r\nAtchison, and has never been worsted in an encounter. Endowed with a\r\nkeen observant mind and a remarkable memory, she has made many prominent\r\nfriends during her career, and has often been called upon to assist them\r\nin various capacities, an instance of which is found in the aid which\r\nshe gave Bishop Tuttle in the preparation of his reminiscences of the\r\nOld Santa Fe Trail. To quote the words of a prominent friend of hers,\r\nwho has known her for many years and witnessed her struggles to attain\r\naffluence, “Mrs. Wheeler is a very remarkable woman.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NAPOLEON B. PIKE.\r\n\r\nNapoleon B. Pike, farmer and stockman, was born May 10, 1856, in\r\nWashington county, Iowa, and is a son of Charles and Maria (Salers)\r\nPike, and was one of eleven children, seven of whom are living. The\r\nfather of Napoleon Pike was born in New York State, November 13, 1826.\r\nHe came to Ohio with his parents and after his marriage went to Iowa.\r\nFor a time he was engaged in a small mercantile business in Iowa, but\r\nlater engaged in farming. He also farmed a place of his own near\r\nAtchison, Kan., where he removed in 1882, but his larger holdings were\r\nin Iowa. He died in 1903. The mother was born in New Jersey in 1836, and\r\ndied in Atchison county, Kansas, in 1898. Both were members of the\r\nMethodist church.\r\n\r\nNapoleon Pike grew up on his father’s Iowa farm. He was married there\r\nand came to Kansas with his father in 1882. For a year he rented land in\r\nDoniphan county, Kansas, when he came to Atchison county, and rented a\r\nfarm in Lancaster township. In 1907 he bought the forty-acre farm which\r\nhe now works. When he took the place it had few improvements, but he has\r\ninvested $8,000 since then, and made a modern farm and keeps graded\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 he married Julia Utterback, who was born in Lancaster, Iowa,\r\nJuly 17, 1856. She is a daughter of Nels and Matilda Utterback, both\r\nnatives of Indiana. To Mr. and Mrs. Pike have been born five children,\r\nas follows: Charles, Center township; Alta (Higley) Lancaster township;\r\nWalter, farmer, Lancaster township; Willard, farmer, Center township,\r\nand Warren, deceased. Mr. Pike is a Republican and a member of the\r\nChristian church of Atchison. He belongs to the Modern Woodmen of\r\nAmerica at Atchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOHN A. SCHOLZ.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirty-seven years in which the Scholz family has resided in\r\nAtchison county, its members have made a record for each and every one\r\nwhich is a credit to their parents and themselves, individually and\r\ncollectively. John and August Scholz, farmers and live stock breeders of\r\nLancaster township, take high rank in the county as enterprising and\r\nsuccessful agriculturists, and have both achieved success, and attained\r\na reputation as specialists, being well known breeders of Shorthorn\r\ncattle. Their father, the late August Schulz, was wise in his day and\r\ngeneration, in that when he came to Atchison county, a comparatively\r\npoor man, he secured enough land which would require that his sons\r\nremain at home and become farmers. He was successful in his plan, and\r\nthe result is seen in the enterprising sons whom he trained to till the\r\nsoil in the best manner possible, and who have been successful, as their\r\nfather had wished. John Scholz is a native son of Kansas, and was born\r\nand brought up on the farm where he now resides. He has one of the\r\nattractive country places in the county, nicely located, with a well\r\nbuilt farm residence, good barns and out-buildings for housing his live\r\nstock and storing the harvests of the Scholz fields. He and his brother,\r\nAugust, have long held their land in common, and worked together on a\r\npartnership basis in a manner satisfactory to both and productive of\r\ngood results.\r\n\r\nJohn A. Scholz was born November 27, 1879, in Atchison county, and is a\r\nson of August and Johanna (Seidel) Scholz, who were the parents of the\r\nfollowing children: Mrs. Pauline McCowin, Renton, Wash.; Herman,\r\nDoniphan county, Kansas; Charles, Lancaster township; Mrs. Louise\r\nThoren, Los Angeles, Cal.; Caroline, wife of J. W. Louthian, Lancaster\r\ntownship, Atchison county; George, Lancaster township; Paul, living near\r\nLancaster, Kan; Mrs. Anna Stockebrand, Yates Center, Kan.; August,\r\nfarming in partnership with his brother, John, in Lancaster township;\r\nJohn A., farmer, Lancaster township; Robert, Lancaster township. The\r\nfamily was reared on the father’s farm and the sons were all taught\r\nfarming. The father was born in Schlesien, Germany, November 25, 1835.\r\nHe learned the blacksmith trade from his father, and worked at the trade\r\nuntil he left Germany in 1870. He was a son of George Frederick Scholz.\r\nHis mother died when he was an infant. Coming to America with his family\r\nof six children, August Scholz resided in St. Joseph, Mo., for a time\r\nwhen he bought a farm of 160 acres in Doniphan county, Kansas, which he\r\noperated about six years. He broke the soil on this place with oxen and\r\nmade all necessary improvements himself. After leaving Doniphan county\r\nhe rented a farm in Atchison county, and then bought 480 acres of\r\nprairie and timber land in Lancaster township, Atchison county, in 1882.\r\nHe bought the farm of Morgan Osborne, and paid $15,000 for it. The place\r\nis known as the “Three Springs Farm” and is located on the northwest\r\nquarter of section 9. This name comes from the fact that the farm has a\r\nfine natural water supply coming from springs located on it. The springs\r\nfurnish water enough for the stock on the farm even in the longest\r\ndrought and supplies the neighborhood when necessary. The father bought\r\nan unusually large farm for a special purpose. He wanted his boys to\r\ngrow up with him, and did not want to see them go out as hired hands for\r\nother farmers, so he went into debt to buy enough land so that the boys\r\ncould work it themselves and make a living on it. He had very little\r\ncapital, but he was industrious and his family was also industrious.\r\nThis enabled them to go in debt for the farm without fear of not being\r\nable to pay for it. The farm was paid for in due time and improvements\r\nwere made constantly. The father farmed until his death, in 1901. The\r\nmother of John Scholz was a daughter of Godfred and Rosanna (Schwartzer)\r\nSeidel. She was born in Schlesien, Germany, April 10, 1840. The father\r\nwas a farmer in his native land. The mother lives with John Scholz. John\r\nScholz attended the Atchison County High School at Effingham, Kan.,\r\nhaving previously gone to school in District No. 3, of Lancaster\r\ntownship. He remained at home after leaving high school, and helped his\r\nfather on the farm. When the father died John was married and began life\r\nfor himself. He and his brother, August, bought 160 acres each from the\r\nheirs, and engaged in farming. They bought 320 acres comprising the old\r\nhome. March 1, 1915, they bought eighty acres additional in Lancaster\r\ntownship, making 400 acres in all. John and his brother began to take a\r\nfancy to high grade stock and they are now breeding fine Shorthorn\r\ncattle. They have a herd of twelve head of thoroughbreds. They have a\r\ngraded stock of horses and breed Poland China hogs also. John A.\r\nespecially takes great interest in mules, and at one time had the\r\nlargest span in the county. These sold for $600. They were five years\r\nold and weighed 3,300 pounds.\r\n\r\nJohn Scholz married Ida R. Meyer, October 1, 1913. She was born March 3,\r\n1882, in Center township, Atchison county, and is a daughter of John and\r\nCaroline (Schroeder) Meyer. John Meyer was born in Switzerland, and came\r\nto Atchison county when he was four years old, with his parents, John\r\nand Verena (Slaughter) Meyer, natives of Switzerland. They were early\r\nsettlers in Center township where they died. John Meyer was born May 8,\r\n1854, and his wife, Caroline (Schroeder) Meyer, was born in Elgin, Ill.,\r\nApril 2, 1859. Mrs. Meyer was the daughter of Nicholas and Katherine\r\nSchroeder, natives of Germany. Mr. and Mrs. Scholz have one child, Ralph\r\nEdward, born August 17, 1914. Mr. Scholz is a Democrat, and he and his\r\nwife belong to the Evangelical church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WALTER E. BROWN.\r\n\r\nWalter E. Brown, of the law firm of Waggener, Challiss & Crane, and the\r\npresent city attorney of Atchison, is a native son of Kansas. He was\r\nborn at Whiting, Jackson county, Kansas, November 17, 1887, and is a son\r\nof William E. and Martha W. (Gilmore) Brown, natives of Pennsylvania.\r\nWilliam E. Brown, the father, came to Kansas with his parents in 1872 at\r\nthe age of sixteen. He is a son of Michael Brown, a native of Ireland.\r\nThe Brown family settled in Brown county, Kansas, where the parents\r\nspent their lives.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 William E. Brown removed to Jackson county and engaged in the\r\nlumber business at Holton, where he is still an extensive lumber dealer\r\nand one of the substantial business men. To William E. and Martha W.\r\n(Gilmore) Brown were born three children, as follows: Walter E., the\r\nsubject of this sketch; Bernice and Harold.\r\n\r\nWalter E. Brown was reared in Holton and educated in the public schools,\r\ngraduating from the high school there. He then entered Kansas\r\nUniversity, Lawrence, Kan., and was graduated in the class of 1909 with\r\nthe degree of Bachelor of Laws. He then came to Atchison and became\r\nassociated with the law firm of which he is now a member. Some few\r\nchanges have taken place in the personnel of the firm of Waggener,\r\nChalliss & Crane within the last few years, but it substantially remains\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown is a Republican and since coming to Atchison has taken an\r\nactive part in political matters. He was elected city attorney in 1913\r\nand reëlected to succeed himself in 1915. He is a Knights Templar and\r\nRoyal Arch Mason and a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of\r\nElks, Loyal Order of Moose, and the Fraternal Order of Eagles. Mr. Brown\r\nis a very capable attorney and has a wide acquaintance in northeastern\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             E. G. BURBANK.\r\n\r\nE. G. Burbank, proprietor of the Burbank printshop, is a native son of\r\nAtchison county. In 1905 Mr. Burbank founded this printing establishment\r\nin a very humble way, which within ten years has developed into one of\r\nthe leading printing plants of eastern Kansas. The phenomenal success of\r\nthis enterprise is, no doubt, due to the fact that Mr. Burbank was an\r\nexpert job and edition printer when he embarked in the business for\r\nhimself. Burbank’s printshop catered to high class printing from the\r\nstart, which has been its specialty and in which it has made a clean\r\nrecord. They do a large amount of high class catalog printing and other\r\nhigh grade work of a kindred nature. They are also well known as book\r\nprinters and binders and printers of high class stationery. The plant\r\nhas a floor space, 30×50 feet and is equipped with all modern machinery\r\nand methods for up-to-date printing.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Burbank started in business for himself he was able to do most\r\nof his work alone, but he now has ten people on his payroll, and the\r\nplant is now one of the most prosperous concerns of Atchison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  S.

Burbank was born at Muscotah, Kan., January 17, 1881, and is a son\r\nof Henry N. and Mina S. (Hazlett) Burbank. Henry N. Burbank, his father,\r\nwas a native of Vermont and came to Atchison county with his father,\r\nGeorge S. Burbank, in the pioneer days of Atchison county. He died in\r\n1913, and his wife now resides at Billings, Mont. E. G. Burbank was\r\nreared in Muscotah, and after receiving a high school education began\r\nhis printing career as “devil” in the office of the _Muscotah Record_.\r\nShortly afterwards, he entered the office of the _Atchison Globe_ and\r\nwas connected with that paper as a printer for four years, when he\r\norganized the plant which now bears his name.\r\n\r\nMr. Burbank was married in 1908 to Miss Millie Anderson, and they have\r\ntwo children: Millie Ervin, born in December, 1910, and John Maxwell,\r\nborn in July, 1912. Mr. Burbank is of the type of business men who are\r\nmaking Atchison the commercial and center that it is. He is a member of\r\nWashington Lodge, No. 5, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, and the\r\nBenevolent and Protective Order of Elks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             H. C. HANSEN.\r\n\r\nThe story of a young man who has been successful in his chosen field\r\nthrough sheer force and energy and aptitude is always interesting.\r\nConsequently, it is fitting that the biography of one of the most\r\nsuccessful life insurance men of northeast Kansas have a proper place in\r\nthe pages of the history of Atchison county. The rise of H. C. Hansen in\r\nthe insurance field has been rapid and substantial until his high place\r\namong the business men of his home city is assured. Born in the little\r\nkingdom of Denmark and reared on American soil, he has given evidence of\r\npossessing the sturdy qualities peculiar to the Danish people which have\r\nled them to the forefront in America wherever they have settled. It is\r\nprobable that no people coming here from foreign shores and speaking an\r\nalien tongue have shown greater adaptability and more acumen in being\r\nassimilated into the great American body of citizens than those who have\r\ncome from Denmark.\r\n\r\nH. C. Hansen was born in Denmark January 17, 1867. His parents were Hans\r\nand Anna Hansen, who left their native land to seek their fortunes in\r\nAmerica in 1869. Hans Hansen was a blacksmith, and the family first\r\nlocated in Atchison. From here they went to Brown county, and a few\r\nyears afterward settled in Doniphan county. Mr. Hansen operated a\r\nblacksmith and wagon-shop at Severance, Kan., until 1890. He then\r\nremoved to Graham county and settled on a farm where he still resides.\r\nHis first wife, Anna, died in 1875, leaving four children, as follows:\r\nMrs. Mary Kellenberg, of Brown county; Mrs. Minnie Knoop, of Canton,\r\nOkla.; Mrs. Ellen Moore, of Cottonwood Falls, Chase county, Kansas, and\r\nHans Christian.\r\n\r\nH. C. Hansen was reared in Doniphan county and was forced by\r\ncircumstances to look after his own education. When still a boy he\r\nlearned the blacksmith’s trade and also worked as a farm hand. He had\r\nlittle opportunity to secure an education and received no encouragement\r\nfrom his parents to acquire knowledge. It was necessary for him to earn\r\nmoney to support himself while attending school. He studied for two\r\nyears in the Christian Brothers College of St. Joseph after he became of\r\nage. Beginning with December 20, 1892, he served twelve years as\r\nsalesman for the Edward Heeney Hardware Company, of Severance, Kan. He\r\nthen became local agent for the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company at\r\nSeverance. So successful was Mr. Hansen in his new vocation that in a\r\nshort period of eighteen months he was tendered the position of general\r\nagent of the company, with headquarters in Atchison. He has written as\r\nhigh as $200,000 in life insurance policies yearly and his success still\r\ncontinues. A strong and amiable personality combined with energy and\r\npersistence have been factors in enabling him to advance with such rapid\r\nstrides in a field which is full of able competitors. In addition to his\r\nduties as general agent of the Penn Mutual Insurance Company, he looks\r\nafter his farm of 120 acres, located five and one-half miles east of\r\nPotter. Mr. Hansen has purchased this farm with money earned in selling\r\nlife insurance, and he is displaying the same energy in developing his\r\nfarm acreage that placed him to the forefront in the life insurance\r\nfield. An old, rundown orchard of about ten acres was located on his\r\nfarm. He had this orchard placed in shape for fruit bearing by trimming\r\nthe trees and spraying with a power sprayer. The results are seen in the\r\nfine quality of fruit which the trees have yielded. He has been awarded\r\nthree first prizes at the Atchison county horticultural display.\r\n\r\nMr. Hansen was married August 20, 1891, to Katie Browning, a daughter of\r\nFrank Browning, an early pioneer settler of Doniphan county. To them\r\nhave been born the following children: Anna, a graduate of the public\r\nschool and high school, and now a teacher in the schools of Sparks,\r\nKan.; Bettie, a trained nurse, who graduated from the Sisters of Charity\r\nHospital, at St. Joseph, in October of 1915; Crystelle, a milliner in\r\nthe Ramsey store; and William Penn or “Pat,” the youngest of the family.\r\n\r\nPolitically, Mr. Hansen is an independent Republican, inclined to be\r\nprogressive in his ideas of government by the people, and favoring those\r\ncandidates for office who seem to be capable of serving the people to\r\nthe best advantage of all. He is a member of St. Benedict’s Catholic\r\nChurch, and is fraternally connected with the Knights of Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JULIUS DEUTSCH.\r\n\r\nJulius Deutsch, retired merchant and capitalist, of Atchison, is a\r\ncitizen who has made his own way in the world, and achieved a\r\nsatisfactory measure of success in the mercantile field. He was born in\r\nLorraine, the French province of Germany, November 27, 1858, a son of\r\nMolling and Melanie Deutsch, who were born and reared in Lorraine.\r\nMolling Deutsch was a wholesale grain and flour merchant in his native\r\ntown. Melanie Deutsch was a daughter of M. Friend, a soldier in the\r\nNapoleonic wars, and who was awarded the Medal of St. Helena for bravery\r\non the field of battle. Both parents lived their lives and died in the\r\nland of their nativity.\r\n\r\nWhen Julius Deutsch had completed his education at the age of fourteen\r\nyears, in 1872, he immigrated to America, coming direct to Atchison,\r\nwhere he made his home for a short time with an uncle, L. Friend. Later,\r\nhe entered the employ of another uncle, I. Friend, a merchant, doing\r\nbusiness in Seneca. He worked in the store at Seneca for two years, sold\r\ngoods in Atchison for another year, spent one year in a mercantile\r\nestablishment at Topeka, and then embarked in business for himself. Mr.\r\nDeutsch established a general store at Muscotah in 1878, which was a\r\nsuccessful venture. Prosperity attended his efforts, and it was not long\r\nuntil he and his brothers embarked in the mercantile business at Horton,\r\nKan., and established a store which they still own. He was associated in\r\nhis business ventures with his brothers, Sylvain, Maurice, Simon, and\r\nIsaac. Simon is now a resident of Cleveland, Ohio. Isaac is deceased.\r\nThe brothers established a chain of stores and operated them at Beloit,\r\nAtchison, Valley Falls, Muscotah, and Concordia, which were generally\r\nsuccessful, and made money on the investments. Mr. Deutsch continued in\r\nactive mercantile pursuits until his retirement to Atchison in 1902. He\r\nfirst came to Atchison from Muscotah in 1885, turned over the business\r\nat Muscotah to his brother, and then engaged in business in this city.\r\nHis brother, Maurice, now operates the store at Horton, Kan. Sylvain\r\nDeutsch makes his home principally in Kansas City. During later years\r\nthe Deutsch brothers have disposed of a number of their various stores,\r\nand now operate the Horton concern only. Their capital is mainly\r\ninvested in real estate, consisting of city property and farm lands in\r\nKansas and the West. Isaac Deutsch was the first of the family to come\r\nto America to seek his fortune, and his brothers followed, and a\r\ncommunity of interests which held them together at all times, resulted\r\nin all becoming well-to-do.\r\n\r\nMr. Deutsch and his brothers are interested in a number of financial\r\ninstitutions, and he has many friends among the substantial citizens of\r\nhis home city. He took an active part in the incorporation of the town\r\nof Muscotah, serving as city councilman. He is of the Jewish faith, and\r\nis prone to assist all religious denominations to the extent of his\r\nability, being tolerant and broad-minded in this respect. He is\r\nfraternally allied with the Odd Fellows and the Elks. Mr. Deutsch\r\npossesses a likable personality, which, coupled with a kindly and\r\ncourteous demeanor at all times, makes him well liked by his associates\r\nand esteemed for his many excellent qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          STARK WILBOR ADAMS.\r\n\r\nStark Wilbor Adams, general manager for the Aetna Life Insurance\r\nCompany, with offices in the new Masonic Temple, and secretary of the\r\nAtchison County High School board, is a native of the Buckeye State,\r\nborn in May, 1866, at Huron, Ohio, and a scion of an old American family\r\nwhich traces its lineage back to the colonial days of New England. His\r\nfather, Stark Adams, and his mother, Mary (Chandler) Adams, were born in\r\nMilan, Ohio, and Birmingham, Ohio, respectively. Stark Adams was a son\r\nof Philo, a son of Daniel Adams, of Vermont, who was a soldier in the\r\nContinental army during the American war of independence, and was a\r\nbrother-in-law of Ethan Allen, of Vermont. Daniel was second in command\r\nof the “Green Mountain Boys” at the capture of Crown Point and\r\nTiconderoga. In recognition of his services in behalf of the new nation,\r\nhe was given a grant of land in the Western Reserve. His son, Philo,\r\nrode horseback from Middlebury, Vt., to the Huron river valley in 1816\r\nand took possession of the tract which had been granted to the family by\r\nthe Government. He also traded a horse for an eighty-acre tract in\r\naddition to his own grant. He and three brothers settled on the land\r\nlying along the course of the Huron river, Philo locating at the mouth\r\nof the river where it flows into Lake Erie, and upon which the town of\r\nHuron was eventually built. The brothers became the owners of about 600\r\nacres of land in the neighborhood. They cleared the land of standing\r\ntimber, planted corn, harvested and shelled it during the first season,\r\nthen crossed the lake to Buffalo to trade grain for supplies, which they\r\nagain traded with the Indians for furs. They conducted a general trading\r\nbusiness and the settlement grew from this beginning, in course of time\r\nto be of considerable importance. Philo Adams was a first cousin of John\r\nQuincy Adams, and was appointed the first collector of the Port of\r\nHuron. The first of the family to come to America was Henry Adams, who\r\ncame to Plymouth on the “Mayflower,” when the good ship made its second\r\nvoyage to bring over the Puritans, and he settled at Mt. Wolaston, (now\r\nQuincy, Mass.) in 1638. Joseph Adams II was the son of Henry, the\r\nfounder of the family in America; Joseph III, son of Joseph Adams, was\r\nnext in line, and was the father of Daniel and President John Adams,\r\nsecond President of the United States. Daniel Adams was the father of\r\nPhilo Adams, and direct ancestor of the Adams family.\r\n\r\nStark Adams, accompanied by his family, left the old home in Ohio in\r\n1878, crossed the country to Hays City, Kan., and there homesteaded on\r\n160 acres of land, taking up a timber claim of the same number of acres\r\nat the same time. Settlers were few and far between in that part of\r\nKansas in those days, and the country was settling up slowly because of\r\nthe droughts and other vicissitudes with which the farmers had to\r\ncontend. Ten years after locating near Hays City, Mr. Adams came to\r\nAtchison and eventually bought a farm four miles south of the city, on\r\nwhich he lived until his retirement to a residence on the corner of Q\r\nand Sixth streets in Atchison. He was born October 14, 1827, and died\r\nAugust 30, 1909. His children are: Augusta J., at home; C. B., of 714\r\nPark street; James Otis, on a farm, eight miles southwest of the city;\r\nStark Wilbor; Margaretta L., at home, associated with S. W. in the\r\noffice located on the second floor of the new Masonic Temple; J. D., at\r\nthe family home in Atchison at 517 South Seventh street.\r\n\r\nS. W. Adams and family came to Atchison from the farm in February, 1908,\r\nand engaged in the insurance business, the mother and father and family\r\ncoming to the city in December of the same year. He opened his present\r\noffice May 1, 1914, when Mr. Adams was appointed manager of the Aetna\r\nLife Insurance Company for northeast Kansas. His career as an insurance\r\nsolicitor and manager has been very successful. The real estate and loan\r\nbusiness conducted in the same office is in charge of Jay D. Adams.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams was married December 25, 1899, to Miss Mary Speck, who was\r\nborn on a pioneer farm in Atchison county on Stranger creek in Mt.\r\nPleasant township. She was a daughter of Archimides S. and Sarah E.\r\nSpeck, natives of Kentucky and North Carolina, respectively, who\r\nemigrated from Indiana to Kansas, driving a team the entire distance,\r\nduring the year 1855. (Further data concerning Mr. and Mrs. Speck will\r\nbe found elsewhere in this volume.) To this union have been born,\r\nDorothy M., Sarah E., Mildred J., Lorena Wilberta, Wilbor Speck.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams is a Republican in politics and has taken a more or less\r\nactive part in political and civic affairs. For the past five years he\r\nhas served the county as secretary of the Atchison County High School\r\nboard. He and the members of his family are affiliated with the\r\nPresbyterian church. Fraternally he is allied with the Odd Fellows,\r\nKnights of Pythias and the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GEORGE SCHOLZ.\r\n\r\nGeorge Scholz, farmer and stockman of Lancaster township, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, was born in Germany, April 22, 1870, and is a son of\r\nAugust and Johanna (Seidel) Scholz, who were the parents of seven\r\nchildren: Mrs. Pauline (McCowin), Renton, Wash.; Herman, Doniphan\r\ncounty, Kansas; Charles, Lancaster township, farmer; Louise, wife of C.\r\nThoren, Los Angeles, Cal.; Caroline, wife of J. W. Louthian, Lancaster\r\ntownship; Paul, living near Lancaster, Kansas; Mrs. Anna Stockebrand,\r\nYates Center, Kan.; August, farming with his brother, John, in Lancaster\r\ntownship, and John, farmer, Lancaster township; Robert, Lancaster\r\ntownship. The family was reared on the father’s farm where all the sons\r\nwere taught farming. The father was born November 25, 1835, in\r\nSchlesien, Germany, and learned the blacksmith trade from his father,\r\nand worked at that trade until he left Germany in 1870. He was a son of\r\nGeorge Frederick Scholz. His mother died when he was an infant. Coming\r\nto America with his family of six children, August Scholz resided in St.\r\nJoseph, Mo., for a time and then bought a farm of 160 acres in Doniphan\r\ncounty, Kansas, which he worked about six years. He broke this place\r\nwith oxen and made all necessary improvements himself. After leaving\r\nDoniphan county he bought 480 acres of prairie and timber land in\r\nAtchison county, Kansas. This was in 1882. He bought the farm of Morgan\r\nOsborne and paid $15,000 for it. The place is known as the “Three\r\nSprings Farm.” It is located on the northwest quarter of section 9. The\r\nname comes from the fact that the farm has a fine natural water supply\r\nfrom springs located on it. The springs supply water for the stock on\r\nthe farm even in the longest drought.\r\n\r\nThe father bought an unusually large farm for the reason that he wanted\r\nhis boys to grow up on his own farm. He did not want to see them go out\r\nand work for strangers. His capital was limited but he and his sons were\r\nindustrious, and they were able to go into debt to acquire more land,\r\nand the farm was paid for in due time and improvements were made as\r\nrapidly as possible. The father farmed his place until his death, in\r\n1901. The mother of George Scholz was a daughter of Godfred and Rosanna\r\n(Schwartzer) Seidel, and was born in Schlesien, Germany, April 10, 1840,\r\nand is now living with her son, John. The father was a farmer in his\r\nnative land.\r\n\r\nGeorge Scholz attended the Atchison county schools, finishing at the\r\nRock district school. He remained at home until he was twenty-six years\r\nold, when he rented a farm which he operated in partnership with his\r\nbrother, Charles A. In 1905, George bought the farm which he now owns,\r\nand which consists of 120 acres in section 24, Lancaster township. The\r\nplace was comparatively unimproved, having only an old house and barn.\r\nSince then he has built a modern eight-room house, electric lighted and\r\nmodern in all respects. In addition, he has erected a fine barn, 40×36\r\nfeet in size. It is electric lighted and equipped with up-to-date\r\nconveniences. Mr. Scholz keeps graded stock on his farm and is a\r\nprogressive farmer and conducts his farm in an efficient manner. When he\r\nand his brother were farming together, ten or more years ago, they sold\r\ncorn from the field as low as fourteen cents per bushel.\r\n\r\nMr. Scholz was married to Anna Buttron, February 10, 1909. She was born\r\nOctober 20, 1877, and is the daughter of Henry and Rosanna Buttron. Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Scholz have two children: Gilbert, born December 31, 1909, and\r\nKarl, born January 16, 1914. Mr. Scholz is an independent voter. He is a\r\nmember of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows lodge, of Lancaster, No.\r\n355, and attends the Lutheran church, of which his wife is a member. Mr.\r\nScholz made his first investment in 160 acres in Sheridan county,\r\nKansas, for $1,100 in 1902, and sold it three years later for $2,400.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THOMAS E. HORNER, M. D.\r\n\r\nDiligence in the pursuit of success is inevitably rewarded, be it in the\r\nmarts of finance or in the ranks of the learned professions. The\r\nprofession of medicine has from earliest times offered opportunity for\r\nhonor and social prominence, as well as giving its members a chance for\r\nbettering the condition of mankind in general as well as physical. The\r\nphysician is at once the friend in need who alleviates our ills and is\r\noften the family adviser. To him very frequently are intrusted the\r\nsecret troubles which beset his patients many times and he thus becomes\r\na benefactor to mankind in more ways than one. Thus, the needs of this\r\nnoble profession require a high type of individual who is at once a\r\nlearned and skilled practitioner and gentleman in whom the people can\r\nplace their trust. Dr. Thomas E. Horner is of the type of physician in\r\nwhom one can have confidence and whose ability in his life work is\r\nmarked, the best evidence of which is his large practice in and near the\r\ncity of Atchison.\r\n\r\nHe is a native born Kansan, born on a farm on Independence creek in\r\nDoniphan county August 8, 1875, a son of Isaac and Elizabeth (Farrell)\r\nHorner, natives of Ireland. His father was born in 1836 in the town of\r\nColeriyne, Ireland, and his mother is a native of County Cavan, North\r\nIreland, born in 1842. Isaac died in Atchison county in 1911. He\r\nimmigrated to America with his father, James Horner, who bought a farm\r\nnear New York City, returning to Ireland where he resided for twelve\r\nyears, after which he located in western Pennsylvania. From there Isaac\r\nremoved to Kansas in 1859 and became a freighter across the plains,\r\noperating his own outfit. He married in 1866 and settled on Independence\r\ncreek. Isaac left the farm in 1880 and removed to Atchison where he\r\nengaged in buying and shipping live stock until his death. He became\r\nwell-to-do and was the owner of over 1,000 acres of land in Doniphan and\r\nAtchison counties. He was an excellent business man and a keen trader\r\nwho was honest in his dealings and enjoyed the respect and esteem of\r\nthose with whom he came in contact during his long life. Coming of an\r\nexcellent Irish family, he was a younger son and had a brother named\r\nSamuel who was educated in Oxford University, and was an early settler\r\nin Atchison county, dying in Jackson county, Kansas, in 1886. The\r\nchildren born to Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Horner are as follows: Mrs.\r\nElizabeth McGurk, Frankfort, Kan.; Mrs. Ella St. Peters, Denver, Colo.;\r\nJames, who married Nellie Deigan and resides in Parnell, Kan.; Rose, at\r\nhome with her mother, and Dr. Thomas E. Horner, with whom this review is\r\ndirectly concerned; Mrs. Marie Farrell, widow of James Farrell, of\r\nAtchison; and Samuel, who married Mollie Butler, and resides at Jarbalo,\r\nLeavenworth county.\r\n\r\nDr. Horner was educated in the parochial schools and Christian Brothers\r\nCollege at St. Joseph, Mo., from which academic institution he graduated\r\nin 1893 with the highest honors of his class. He then pursued the study\r\nof medicine and graduated from the Kentucky College of Medicine in 1897.\r\nFor two years he practiced medicine at Vliets, Marshall county; then at\r\nSeverance, Doniphan county, for a period which ended in 1911, prior to\r\nhis location in Atchison. He has built up an excellent practice and has\r\na beautiful home at 1114 Santa Fe street.\r\n\r\nIn politics Dr. Horner is a Democrat; he is a member of the Catholic\r\nchurch, and is affiliated with the Knights and Ladies of Security, the\r\nFraternal Aid Societies, the Mystic Workers, and the Knights of\r\nColumbus. He is likewise associated with the Atchison County, the Kansas\r\nState and the American Medical associations. He served as police surgeon\r\nof the city of Atchison.\r\n\r\nDr. Horner was married January 11, 1898, to Sadie E. Armstrong, and to\r\nthem have been born three children: Elizabeth, aged fifteen years; Mary,\r\nfourteen years of age, and Thomas, aged seven years. The mother of these\r\nchildren is a daughter of Thomas T. and Mary J. (White) Armstrong.\r\nThomas T. Armstrong was born in 1846 in Canada and came to Kansas when a\r\nyoung man and entered the employ of the Missouri Pacific railroad. He is\r\nnow living a retired life in Atchison. His wife, Mary J., died January\r\n9, 1902, leaving one son, Fred, a resident of Seattle, Wash.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOSEPH E. GIBSON.\r\n\r\nJoseph E. Gibson, farmer, of Center township, Atchison county, Kansas,\r\nand a widely known breeder of Shorthorn cattle, has one of the\r\nattractive and well kept farm homes in Atchison county, located directly\r\non the White Way, a much traveled and fairly well kept highway, crossing\r\nAtchison county from east to west. Mr. Gibson was born August 22, 1861,\r\nin Union county, Ohio, and is a descendant of good old Virginia stock.\r\nHis parents were John and Susannah (Westlake) Gibson, the former a\r\nnative of Virginia and the latter of the Buckeye State. John Gibson, the\r\nfather, was born in Westmoreland county, Virginia, June 17, 1824, and\r\nwas the son of Leven and Mary (McClure) Gibson, who were among the early\r\nsettlers of the State of Ohio, migrating from their old homestead in\r\nVirginia in 1833 and settling in Ohio, where they lived on a pioneer\r\nfarm the remainder of their days. John Gibson was reared to young\r\nmanhood on his father’s farm, and after his marriage settled on a farm\r\nof his own in Union county, Ohio, where Joseph was born and reared. John\r\nGibson was the father of seven children, namely: Arthur, a farmer living\r\nin Union county, Ohio; Joseph E.; Mattie, deceased; Mrs. Rosa F. Staley,\r\nof Union county, Ohio; Thomas, a farmer and sawmill operator in\r\nLouisiana; Mrs. Lizzie Schuler, residing in New Dover, Ohio; and Asa, a\r\nfarmer, of New Dover, Ohio. The father of these children died in 1899.\r\nThe mother was born in Belmont county, Ohio, in 1829 and departed this\r\nlife in 1907. She was a daughter of Josiah and Christena (Knughouf)\r\nWestlake.\r\n\r\nJoseph E. Gibson, of whom this review directly treats, was brought up on\r\nhis father’s farm in Union county, Ohio, and there attended the district\r\nschool. He remained with his parents until 1891 and then migrated to\r\nKansas, to become a foreman in the fruit orchards owned by J. W. Parker\r\nin Atchison county. Eight years later he rented a farm three miles north\r\nof Shannon, Kan., and in 1901 purchased the farm of eighty acres which\r\nhe is now cultivating in Center township. This tract of eighty acres\r\nlies in sections 10, 6 and 19 of this township and is well improved. The\r\nimprovements which Mr. Gibson has placed on his farm since buying it\r\nwill exceed $1,400. For some years he has been a breeder of pure bred\r\nShorthorn cattle and ships the product of his farm to all parts of the\r\ncountry. He has a herd of high grade Shorthorn cattle to the number of\r\ntwenty-eight head. The cattle bring good prices at private sale, the\r\nbuyers visiting the farm for the purpose of purchase. He also is a\r\nbreeder of Big Type Poland China hogs of the best breed obtainable.\r\n\r\nMr. Gibson was married November 8, 1888, to Miss Virginia I. Weaver, and\r\nto this union the following children have been born: Imogene, a graduate\r\nof the Atchison County High School; Walter S., at home, attending\r\nbusiness college at Atchison; one child died in infancy. The mother of\r\nthese children was born on April 17, 1864, near Lockburn, Franklin\r\ncounty, Ohio, a daughter of Samuel and Isabella (Gavel) Weaver, the\r\nformer a native of Ohio, and the latter a daughter of German parents.\r\nThe mother of Mrs. Gibson is aged eighty-one years and makes her home\r\nwith her daughter.\r\n\r\nSamuel M. Weaver was born in Pickaway county, Ohio, May 20, 1826, a son\r\nof George and Isabel (McConnell) Weaver, who were the parents of six\r\nchildren. The father, George, was a native of Berks county,\r\nPennsylvania, where he remained until 1806, when he came west and\r\nlocated in Pickaway county, Ohio, near where the city of Circleville is\r\nnow located. He was a tailor by trade, and for many years held the\r\noffice of deputy sheriff of that county. He was a soldier in the War of\r\n1812. He died in 1848. Samuel Weaver was well educated. When twenty\r\nyears of age he went west and traveled in different states for ten\r\nyears. When thirty years old, while traveling in Iowa he met Isabel\r\nGavel, to whom he was married December 16, 1856. She was born in Germany\r\nand immigrated with her parents to America when one year old and was\r\nreared in Franklin county, Ohio. She was born April 3, 1835. Samuel and\r\nIsabel Weaver were the parents of five children: Mrs. Catharine E.\r\nCunningham. She died at Cleveland, Ohio, in 1911; Mrs. Virginia I.\r\nGibson; Mrs. Mary F. Southern died at Marysville, Ohio, in 1900; George\r\nH. and Samuel, deceased. Samuel, after a residence in Franklin county,\r\nlocated in Delaware county, Ohio, in 1869 and farmed until his death,\r\nJuly 26, 1904.\r\n\r\nMr. Gibson is a Democrat who has taken an active interest in political\r\nand civic affairs in the county, and is now serving his third term as\r\ntrustee of Center township. It is needless to remark that he is\r\nsatisfying the people of the township and is an efficient and capable\r\nofficial who looks after the township affairs as carefully as he does\r\nhis own personal affairs, he is fraternally affiliated with the Odd\r\nFellows lodge, the Modern Woodmen, and the Central Protective\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gibson takes a just pride in keeping the place in spick and span\r\ncondition and she has a beautiful lawn fronting the White Way road which\r\nattracts the attention of travelers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BENJAMIN PATTON CURTIS.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Patton Curtis has been for sixty-one years a Kansan. Looking\r\nback what wonderful changes do these years present to the onlooker! The\r\nprivations, vicissitudes and perils of those days in which the State was\r\nborn; the beginning of her commerce when the ox team and flat-boat were\r\nthe principal means of transportation; the five long drawn-out years of\r\ncivil strife in which the Union was preserved; the era of agricultural\r\ndevelopment, when the wild prairies were transformed into fruitful\r\nfields of golden grain; the epoch in which railways were keeping pace\r\nwith the settler, the merchant, the manufacturer, and steam and\r\nelectricity displaced the ox team and stage coach. Sixty-one years in\r\nKansas, from the days of the prairie schooner, flat-boat and pony\r\nexpress, to the days of the automobile, air-ship and telephone; to have\r\ndone his share in connection with these great developments; to have\r\nthrough his unaided efforts and with determination and energy achieved\r\nsuccess to have so lived that he is honored by his friends and\r\nneighbors, entitles the man whose name initiates this review to a\r\nprominent place in this publication, the history of the county in which\r\nhe is passing the sunset years of his life.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Patton Curtis, pioneer, successful farmer and Civil war\r\nveteran, since 1904 a resident of the city of Atchison, was born on the\r\ntwenty-seventh day of March, 1839, while his parents were encamped in\r\nthe wilderness of Missouri, a terrific snow storm having interrupted\r\ntheir journey to Illinois. His father, John M. Curtis, was a native of\r\nsouthern Tennessee. He had married when a young man, Mary Ann Warren,\r\nalso of that State, and with his young wife had settled in Missouri.\r\nThey were both of Scotch-Irish ancestry and came from a remarkably long-\r\nlived line of forebears, one of whom lived to the age of 104 years. In\r\n1839 the family removed from Missouri and settled in Adams county,\r\nIllinois, where they remained until 1854, when they came to Kansas\r\nTerritory, settling just across the Missouri river from St. Joe. John M.\r\nCurtis became a stanch Republican after seeing the abuse of slaves while\r\nin Missouri, and he was one of the fearless men who came to Kansas for\r\nthe purpose of making her a free State. He preëmpted a quarter section\r\nof land and then engaged in “following the river,” as it was then\r\ntermed, flat-boating, rafting and steam-boating. His three sons, among\r\nwhom was our subject, also followed that occupation for a time.\r\n\r\nBen P. Curtis spent the first fifteen years of his life in Adams county,\r\nIllinois. His schooling was scant and that little was acquired in the\r\ncountry schools. In his fifteenth year he came to Kansas Territory with\r\nhis parents, as has been previously stated, and within a short time was\r\nemployed on the Missouri river. The free life of the plains called him,\r\nbut as his two brothers had run away from home, and he was the only son\r\nleft, his longing to become a freighter was unsatisfied, as he preferred\r\nto remain with his father. He was one of the first in his section of the\r\nState to heed President Lincoln’s call for volunteers, and in May, 1861.\r\nhe enlisted in Company A, First Kansas Volunteer infantry, under Capt.\r\nB. P. Chenowith. He was with his regiment in all its engagements, and is\r\nAtchison’s only survivor of the battle of Wilson’s Creek. After the\r\nburning of Holly Springs with $2,000,000 worth of supplies; the First\r\nKansas was compelled to live off the country. During the march to\r\nMemphis, and while out foraging, Ben Curtis was captured and taken to\r\nRipley, Miss. He was paroled, and while waiting to be exchanged he and a\r\ncompanion, Alverton Abbey, decided to exchange their uniforms for the\r\nrebel grey and join the Union lines as deserters and reënlist in some\r\nregiment other than their own, knowing full well they would be shot if\r\nthey were again captured while serving with the First Kansas. They were\r\nsuccessful in securing the rebel uniforms and gained the Union lines,\r\nCurtis taking the name of C. F. Barker and his comrade, Abbey, that of\r\nWilliam Payne. He enlisted in the Fifth Illinois cavalry, and Ben\r\nCurtis, under the name of C. F. Barker. At the time of his capture he\r\nwas serving as sergeant, and when enlisting under Captain Chandler he\r\nshowed him his parole as Sergeant B. P. Curtis. The captain assured him\r\nhe would not lose his rank and he was accordingly made a sergeant and\r\nserved as such until mustered out in February, 1864.\r\n\r\nOn conclusion of his military service he returned to Doniphan county and\r\nresumed his old employment of “following the river,” remaining in this\r\nfield of occupation until 1867, when he bought a quarter section of land\r\nin Doniphan county and engaged in farming. He made a success as an\r\nagriculturist, was an active and influential factor in the life of his\r\nsection and reared a family of six daughters, all of whom are women of\r\neducation, intellectuality and refinement. In 1901 Mr. Curtis’ health\r\nfailed and he disposed of his farming interests and became a resident of\r\nTroy, and in 1904 came to Atchison, where he has since resided.\r\n\r\nOn July 23, 1865, Mr. Curtis married Mary Eliza Ashcraft, a daughter of\r\nJeddiah Ashcraft. She was born July 23, 1844, in Larue county, Kentucky,\r\nher marriage being on the twenty-first anniversary of her birth. The\r\nfirst eight years of her life were spent in her native State, the\r\nfollowing three in Missouri, and in 1855 her father brought his family\r\nto Kansas and took up a claim near Mt. Pleasant, where she lived until\r\nher marriage with Mr. Curtis. She was for a time a teacher in the\r\nDoniphan school. They are the parents of the following children: Bird,\r\nthe wife of Judson F. Thayer, of Stormsburg, Neb.; Anna, the wife of\r\nJulian Tait, of St. Joseph, Mo.; Mable, the wife of William Maynard, of\r\nCologne, S. D.; Maude, the wife of A. W. Toole, of St. Joseph, Mo.;\r\nJessie, the wife of C. H. Allison, of Chicago, Ill.; and Frances, the\r\nwife of A. E. Williamson, of Troy, Kan.\r\n\r\nOn July 23, 1915, their children, sons-in-law, grandchildren, friends\r\nand acquaintances gave them signal honor in a fitting observance of\r\ntheir golden wedding anniversary. The _Atchison Globe_ of that date says\r\nin part: “Fifty years ago today Miss Mary Eliza Ashcraft and Benjamin\r\nPatton Curtis were married in Doniphan.” Of their first meeting it\r\nstates: “The Ashcraft home was on the old Military road, and when Ben\r\nCurtis, a soldier in the Civil war, passed there Mary Ashcraft handed\r\nhim a cup of water which he drew up from the well. However, that was not\r\nthe beginning of the love affair which culminated in the marriage of\r\nMary Ashcraft and Ben Curtis. They fell in love with each other in\r\nDoniphan, where Miss Mary Ashcraft went to teach school, and Mr. Curtis\r\ndoes not accuse his wife of ‘chasing’ him. He asked for an introduction\r\nto the pretty school teacher. After he received it he never took another\r\ngirl.” Mrs. Curtis is the type of woman everyone admires. Her home is\r\nher kingdom and she rules it wisely and well. She has never belonged to\r\na woman’s club, but when there is sickness or trouble at her own home,\r\nor in the neighborhood, Mrs. Curtis is on hand, capable, gentle and\r\nsympathetic. She rules her home with a velvet hand, and her husband says\r\nthat he notices as the years glide by he gets off at the stations for\r\nwhich she has bought the tickets, not because he has to, but because he\r\nwants to.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Curtis it states: “If you don’t know Ben Curtis there is missing\r\nfrom your acquaintance one of the most companionable of men. Friends who\r\nhave hunted and fished with him say that he is a seventy-seven year old\r\nprince. A lover of wild life, he has thoroughly enjoyed his retired\r\nlife, which has now covered a period of fourteen years. In the summer he\r\nhunts the best game and fishing resorts of the North, and the winter is\r\nliable to find him down around Corpus Christi, Texas, or some other\r\nlocality that is attractive when this climate isn’t. At Leach Lake,\r\nMinn., a famous resort on Leach Lake, if you tell the people that you\r\nare from Atchison and a friend of Ben Curtis, the place instantly\r\nbelongs to you.” Without sons of his own, he has naturally taken a great\r\ninterest in his nephews and is justly proud of the position attained by\r\nthe following, all of whom are Doniphan county boys: Edward Franklin,\r\nformerly of the Smithsonian Institute at Washington, now professor of\r\nchemistry at Leland Stanford University; Thomas Franklin, a prominent\r\ninsurance underwriter, of Chicago; and Professor Will Franklin, of\r\nLehigh University. The latter is also the author of several text books\r\nwhich are in general use.\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis has been a life-long Republican, and during his residence in\r\nDoniphan county took an active part in its political affairs. Political\r\noffice has never appealed to him, and, although often urged by his\r\nfriends to accept nomination, he refused. He is a member of Severance\r\nPost, No. 391, Grand Army of the Republic, and is prominent in Masonic\r\ncircles. He has attained the Knights Templar degree and is affiliated\r\nwith Abdallah Temple, Mystic Shrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JOHN W. ABNER, M. D.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Abner, M. D., although recently locating in Atchison, his skill\r\nand ability as a capable and painstaking physician has met with ready\r\nrecognition and he has a large and growing practice. Dr. Abner is a\r\nnative of Kentucky. He was born in Clay county, in 1867, a son of John\r\nand Matilda (Robinson) Abner, both natives of Kentucky. Dr. John W.\r\nAbner was one of a family of three children whose parents died when they\r\nwere very young and the children were reared by friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Abner was fifteen years old he started out to make his own way\r\nin life. He was always of a studious turn of mind and by his own efforts\r\nobtained a very good education. At an early age he determined to be a\r\nphysician and bent his every effort in that direction. He learned the\r\ncarpenter and cabinet maker’s trade, and after working at his trade for\r\nsome time he entered the Eclectic Medical College of Kansas City, where\r\nhe was graduated in the class of 1912 with the degree of Doctor of\r\nMedicine and Doctor of Philosophy. He engaged in the practice of his\r\nprofession in Kansas City. Mo., where he remained until February, 1915,\r\nwhen he located in Atchison, Kan. He has a fine suite of offices at 712\r\n1–2 Commercial street and is meeting with well merited success. Doctor\r\nAbner was married in 1902 to Ada Pearl Wade, of Kansas City, Mo., and\r\nthey have one child, Dorothy, born January 6, 1905. Dr. Abner is a\r\nmember of the Christian church and takes an active part in the work of\r\nhis denomination and has served on the board of trustees. He is a member\r\nof the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Woodmen of the World.\r\nDr. Abner is a past noble grand and senior warden of Subordinate Lodge,\r\nNo. 577, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and past chief patriarch of\r\nEncampment, No. 27, of Kansas City, Mo., and is a member of the\r\nPatriarchs Militant, No. 14, Kansas City, Mo.\r\n\r\nPolitically, he is an independent Republican and takes a keen interest\r\nin political as well as current events generally. He is a close student\r\nof the science of his profession and aims to keep himself thoroughly\r\nposted in the rapid advances that are constantly being made in the world\r\nof medicine and surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM HENDERSON.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henderson, one of the most industrious farmers of Benton\r\ntownship, Atchison county, Kansas, was born December 29, 1872, in the\r\nlocality where he now lives. His parents, George and Amelia (Stockwell)\r\nHenderson, had six children, of whom the subject is the oldest. The\r\nothers are James, Atchison, Kan., in the employ of the International\r\nHarvester Company; Josie married Walter Kelsey, and now dead; Ella\r\nmarried Clayton Davidson, of Effingham, Kan.; Etta, wife of Arthur\r\nOlinger, Jefferson county, Kansas; Iva, married Elmer Grabiel, Garden\r\nCity, Kan.; George Henderson was born in Platte county, Missouri, in\r\n1844, and came to Leavenworth county, Kansas, with his parents when\r\neleven years of age. Seven years later he came to Atchison county, where\r\nhe has since lived, and is now retired, making his home in Effingham.\r\nThe mother of William Henderson was born in Missouri in 1846.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henderson was reared on the farm and attended the district\r\nschool near the farm, and the Effingham high school one year. He worked\r\nfor his father until he was married to Nettie R. Jenkins September 5,\r\n1900. His wife was born in Mitchell county, Kansas, in 1883, and is a\r\ndaughter of James Q. Jenkins, who came to Atchison county, Kansas, in\r\n1894, from Nebraska, but was born in Illinois. Mr. Henderson owns 180\r\nacres of land which is all well improved, the improvements costing\r\n$5,000. Of four children born to Mr. and Mrs. Henderson, three died in\r\ninfancy. The living child, Floyd, was born May 28, 1904.\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson is a Democrat. He belongs to the Elks lodge of Atchison,\r\nKan., and the Masonic lodge at Effingham. Though not a church member, he\r\nattends regularly. Mr. Henderson has made a success by hard work and\r\ngood management. He is always in favor of movements which benefit the\r\ncommunity and is a public-spirited citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LUMAS M. JEWELL.\r\n\r\nPotter is one of the coming and enterprising towns of Atchison county\r\nand Kansas. During the past few years the town has taken wonderful\r\nstrides in the matter of public improvements and new buildings. A\r\nconsiderable portion of this push and enterprise is directly due to the\r\nenergy and influence of Lumas M. Jewell, retired merchant and banker,\r\nwho can well be called the “father of the present day Potter.” Mr.\r\nJewell has been a consistent booster for the town ever since his advent\r\nin the town, and has given of his time and money toward its development.\r\nMr. Jewell is a self-made Kansan, who has had an interesting career, and\r\nwhose rise from a poor boy to a position of comparative wealth and\r\naffluence is well worth recording in the annals of Atchison county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _L. M. Jewell_,\r\n  _Potter, Kan._\r\n]\r\n\r\nL. M. Jewell was born on a farm in Wayne county, Kentucky, December 3,\r\n1861, a son of Heman S. and Susan Mary (Weaver) Jewell. His father was a\r\nnative of Vermont, who immigrated to Kentucky when a young man, and\r\nengaged in farming operations. He followed farming during his life,\r\nuntil a few years before his demise, at the home of his son, G. W.\r\nJewell, at Kidder, Mo., in 1913. L. M. Jewell received a meager\r\neducation in the schools of his native State, and his later success in\r\nlife has been due entirely to his own efforts. His greatest education\r\nhas been received in the stern school of experience, which is the best\r\nafter all, and most useful, in developing the real attributes of a man.\r\nWhen he was seventeen years of age, he left home and went to the home of\r\nan uncle in Michigan, where he attended school for a time. When he had\r\nattained his majority in 1882, he went to South Dakota and homesteaded a\r\ntract of prairie land. He stayed in South Dakota for two years and\r\ndeveloped his homestead to such an extent that he was able to dispose of\r\nit for a good round price, and he then moved to Caldwell county,\r\nMissouri, and bought another farm, which he cultivated with a fair\r\ndegree of success. Later, he embarked in the mercantile business in\r\nMarvel, Mo., for a period of three years, disposing of his business in\r\n1892, and locating in Potter, Kan. His first employment in Potter was\r\nwith the general merchandise firm of Paxton & Kemper. Three years after\r\nentering the employ of this firm, Mr. Jewell purchased Mr. Paxton’s\r\ninterest for $1,500, paying $400 cash, and borrowing the remaining\r\n$1,100 with which to complete his purchase. It is remarkable that he\r\ncould have so established a reputation for business ability and\r\nintegrity in that time as to be able to command that amount of capital\r\nto swing his first business deal in Kansas. His later successes date\r\nfrom that time on, and in the short time of three years he was out of\r\ndebt, and the business had taken on larger proportions. W. T. Kemper,\r\nhis partner, then sold his interest in the store to a cousin, Madison\r\nKemper, from whom Mr. Jewell purchased the remainder of the business and\r\nbecame the sole owner. During this time the stock of the store had been\r\nincreased, and the business had taken on a wider and a more general\r\nscope through Mr. Jewell’s enterprise and the exercise of his decided\r\nbusiness ability. He became sole owner of the store in 1897, and during\r\nthe next three years the business was placed upon a permanent and stable\r\nfooting, which yielded large profits for its owner. In 1900 Mr. Jewell\r\nconceived the idea of engaging in the real estate business, primarily\r\nfor the purpose of building up the town of Potter and attracting more\r\nresidents to the place. He acquired several business lots and began to\r\nerect buildings to such an extent that Potter soon began to take on the\r\nairs of a growing city. Where there was but one store building on the\r\nside of the street occupied by the Jewell store, he erected five new\r\nstore buildings, which are occupied by merchants who have moved into the\r\ntown in the past fifteen years. It is due to Mr. Jewell’s enterprise in\r\nthis regard that the business part of Potter has been developed.\r\nWhereas, when he first came to Potter the town boasted but three stores—\r\nhis own store, a small hardware shop, and a grocery. All the stores were\r\nsmall and the town did not have a bank. At the present time Potter has\r\ntwo banks and every line of business is represented. As Mr. Jewell’s\r\nbusiness expanded his enterprises included a lumber yard, furniture\r\nstock and a grain elevator. Seeing the need of a bank, he started a plan\r\nof organizing the Potter State Bank in 1899, and after almost a year’s\r\neffort, he received the assistance of O. A. Simmons in effecting the\r\norganization, and Mr. Simmons was the first cashier of the bank. Mr.\r\nJewell later served as cashier, and is now the president of this bank.\r\nIn 1910 Mr. Jewell disposed of his mercantile interests, and is\r\ninterested mainly in real estate and farm lands in Jackson county,\r\nMissouri, and Atchison county, Kansas. He has also made a number of\r\nlarge trades in merchandise stocks.\r\n\r\nMr. Jewell was married in 1897 to Sinnie M. Shaw, a daughter of Henry\r\nShaw, who was an early settler of Kansas. One child was born to them,\r\nEdna Fern Jewell, born in 1901. Mr. Jewell is a Democrat in politics,\r\nand Mrs. Jewell is a member of the Methodist church.\r\n\r\nMr. Jewell’s efforts to advance Potter among the Kansas municipalities\r\nhave not been confined to commercial activities alone, but he has always\r\nhad in mind the welfare of the people along other lines. He had not been\r\na citizen of the town but a few years when he conceived the idea that a\r\nnewspaper would be of great benefit to the community in more ways than\r\none. Consequently, he used every effort to have a paper established in\r\nthe town, and the _Potter Kansan_, one of the best edited small\r\nweeklies, and one of the most prosperous newspaper enterprises in the\r\nState, is the result of his dream. He has been foremost in the cause of\r\neducation, and he worked unremittingly toward the erecting of the\r\npresent modern school building and the establishment of a graded school\r\nsystem in the town. Such men as Mr. Jewell are the kind of citizens\r\nevery town needs, and Potter has been the gainer for his civic\r\nenterprise and the fostering of the growth of his adopted city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WILLIAM R. DONNELLAN.\r\n\r\nWilliam R. Donnellan, hardware merchant and postmaster of Lancaster,\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, was born June 25, 1868, at Lancaster. He is one\r\nof six children of John and Mary J. (Davidson) Donnellan, as follows:\r\nAnna A. (Ostertag), of Atchison; Thomas E., Parsons, Kan.; William R.,\r\nthe subject of this sketch, Lancaster, Atchison county, Kansas; Emma B.,\r\nAtchison, Kan.; Margaret (A. Manglesdorf), Atchison, Kan.; Junia (J.\r\nCleary), Shannon township farmer. John Donnellan, the father, was born\r\nin Ireland in 1827. When twenty years of age he left the Emerald Isle to\r\ntrust his fortunes in America. Landing at Ellis Island, N. Y., he set\r\nout for the interior of New York State and found employment on a dairy\r\nfarm. After a few years of hard labor there he went to Crawfordsville,\r\nInd., and worked in a hardware store. In 1856 he left Crawfordsville and\r\ncame to Kansas, where he preëmpted 160 acres of land in Lancaster\r\ntownship, Atchison county, and built a small, four room house and lived\r\nin the most primitive way. When he first broke the soil on his farm he\r\nused oxen, but later, as he prospered, he used improved methods of\r\nfarming. He died on his farm in 1893. The mother of the subject of this\r\nsketch was born in Harrisburg, Pa., and died in 1892, a year preceding\r\nthe death of her husband.\r\n\r\nWilliam R. Donnellan was born and reared on his father’s farm in\r\nLancaster township. He attended the public schools of Lancaster, and at\r\nthe age of twenty-one went to Kansas City, Mo., and secured employment\r\nas a motorman and conductor in the service of the Street Railway Company\r\nthere. Three years later he became shipping clerk for the A. J. Harwi\r\nHardware Company of Atchison, Kan., and a year later returned to his\r\nhome and engaged in farming on the home place. He remained on the farm\r\nuntil 1903 when he moved to Lancaster and purchased the hardware stock\r\nof H. O. Whittaker. This is a large store, carrying $8,000 worth of\r\nstock. In politics Mr. Donnellan is a Republican. He was elected mayor\r\nof Lancaster in 1907 and served until 1911. In 1903 he was appointed\r\npostmaster.\r\n\r\nMr. Donnellan was married in 1893 to Lillian M. Sanders, who was born\r\nFebruary 12, 1870, at Lewisburg, Pa. She is a daughter of George L. and\r\nElizabeth (Harrison) Sanders, both natives of Pennsylvania. They have\r\none child, Eva M. (Carson), living in Lancaster. She is a graduate of\r\nthe high school and business college. Mr. Donnellan is a member of the\r\nIndependent Order of Odd Fellows, Modern Woodmen of America, and the\r\nKnights and Ladies of Security lodges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LAFAYETTE T. HAWK.\r\n\r\nThe biographical annals and the history of Atchison county, Kansas,\r\nrecord three distinct periods of settlement in Kansas and Atchison\r\ncounty. The first was the real pioneer era, when an influx of settlers\r\ncame, who were the first to break the prairie and lay the foundation for\r\nfuture development. The second was directly after the Civil war, when\r\nmany people came from all parts of the East and European countries. The\r\nlater period was in the eighties, when there came from Ohio and\r\nPennsylvania many excellent American families who have prospered and\r\ntaken leading places in the civic and agricultural development of the\r\ncounty. The Hawk family, of old Pennsylvania German stock, came to this\r\ncounty in the latter era. Lafayette T. Hawk, substantial and well\r\nrespected, and prominent farmer of Benton township, was among this\r\nnumber, who can be reckoned among the latter-day old settlers of the\r\ncounty, and who has resided here for over thirty-four years, and has\r\nworked his way upward from the station of comparatively a poor man to a\r\nposition of affluence in the county.\r\n\r\nL. T. Hawk was born August 22, 1849, in Coshocton county, Ohio, a son of\r\nJonathan and Margaret (Neede) Hawk, both of whom were born and reared in\r\nthe Buckeye State. Jonathan Hawk was born in Coshocton county, Ohio, in\r\n1822, and was a son of Leonard Hawk, born in Pennsylvania, of German\r\nparents. Leonard Hawk was an early immigrant in Coshocton county, Ohio,\r\nand settled in that county when the whole region was a wilderness and\r\ncarved a farm from the dense woods which covered that part of the\r\nBuckeye State in the early part of the nineteenth century. He first came\r\nto Ohio in 1814. Jonathan Hawk came into possession of the old home\r\nplace of his parents’ in Coshocton county, but sold out in 1883, and\r\ncame to Kansas, to join his son, Lafayette T., who had preceded him to\r\nAtchison county by one year. During the first year of his residence\r\nhere, he made his home on his son’s farm, and then purchased the Shell\r\nproperty in Effingham, where he made his home until his demise in\r\nDecember, 1889. He was the owner of eighty acres of land which he\r\nfarmed. Jonathan Hawk was the father of eight children, namely: Sarah\r\ndied in Ohio; Lafayette T., of whom this review is written; Mary Jane\r\nRoll, widow of Samuel Roll, and residing in Effingham; Samuel, living in\r\nOklahoma; Mrs. Margaret Denbow, of Great Bend, Kan.; George Leonard, of\r\nOklahoma; Edith Elzina died at the age of four years; John, deceased.\r\nThe mother died in January, 1891, at the age of sixty-six.\r\n\r\nLafayette T. was reared on the ancestral farm in Coshocton county, Ohio,\r\nand received his education in the district schools of his neighborhood.\r\nHe learned in his youth to do the hardest kind of farm work and was\r\ntaught by his parents the best methods of tilling the soil. When a young\r\nman he became imbued with the desire to locate in the West where\r\nopportunities seemed to be greater than in his home State, and he saved\r\nhis earnings toward this purpose. Not long after his marriage he came to\r\nKansas, in 1882, and located in Benton township, Atchison county. His\r\ncash capital being limited to the sum of $300, he deemed it advisable to\r\nrent land for the first year, then bought his first farm of 160 acres at\r\nthe purchase price of $25 per acre. This farm was necessarily bought on\r\ntime, but with good management and industry, Mr. Hawk was enabled to pay\r\nout and add considerably to the improvements of his place, which is one\r\nof the most attractive in the county and one of the most fertile and\r\nproductive. Mr. Hawk also added ninety acres to his land holdings in\r\nlater years, and invested his surplus in western land which he traded\r\nfor the Effingham Hotel property which he now owns. He is a stockholder\r\nand director of the Farmers and Merchants Bank of Effingham, he is also\r\na stockholder in the Midnight Oil Company, a producing concern with\r\nheadquarters at Morris, Okla.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawk was married March 21, 1874, to Miss Harriet Pitt, of Coshocton\r\ncounty, Ohio, and who was born in Kentucky. To this union have been born\r\nthe following children: Charles, who served in the Twenty-second\r\nregiment, United States infantry, during the Spanish-American war, and\r\nis at present chief of police at Shawnee, Okla.; John D., a prosperous\r\nand progressive farmer in Benton township; Margaret, wife of Clem\r\nHigley, a farmer living in Center township, near Pardee; Homer, who was\r\nkilled in a railway accident in October, 1913; Fred, died in April,\r\n1913, and who had held the position of cashier of the Farmers and\r\nMerchants Bank of Effingham prior to his death; Wilbur D. Hawk, business\r\nmanager of the _Atchison Daily Champion_, and former deputy warden of\r\nthe Federal penitentiary, Atlanta, Ga.; Mrs. Mary Foster, of Trenton,\r\nMo.; Robert, a farmer in Benton township; Clifford, a farmer and\r\nauctioneer in Benton township, and Vera, at home with her parents. The\r\nmother of these children was born, November 8, 1851, in Kentucky, a\r\ndaughter of William and Frances (Phillips) Pitt, the former a native of\r\nNew Jersey and the latter of Vermont. In 1853 Mrs. Pitt and their\r\nchildren removed to Coshocton county, Ohio, Mr. Pitt having died when\r\nMrs. Hawk was an infant. Two of the three children were reared: Mrs.\r\nHawk and Mrs. Lenore (Miller), who died in September, 1915, at Carlton,\r\nOhio. Mrs. Pitt’s second marriage was with Dr. Ephraim P. Stewart, of\r\nCoshocton county, Ohio, where he practiced after moving from Carroll\r\ncounty, Ohio, his birthplace.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few years spent in Atlanta, Ga., with his son,\r\nWilbur D., when on duty as deputy warden of the Federal Penitentiary,\r\nMr. Hawk has lived continuously in Atchison county, since 1882, and has\r\ntaken an active and influential part in the affairs of the county. He is\r\na stanch Republican in his political affiliations, but has never sought\r\npolitical preferment. He and the members of his family are affiliated\r\nreligiously with the Lutheran denomination, which was the faith of his\r\nfather. He is prominent in lodge circles and is a member of the\r\nIndependent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Knights and Ladies of\r\nSecurity. He is one of the original Central Protective Association\r\nmembers and is a charter member of Sunny Hill Lodge, No. 158, of\r\nEffingham, and is prominently connected in Central Protective\r\nAssociation circles throughout the State of Kansas, having organized\r\nseven lodges in this State.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JAMES R. GRAGG.\r\n\r\nFor nearly fifty-nine years James R. Gragg, wealthy farmer and stockman,\r\nof Lancaster township, Atchison county, Kansas, and the present township\r\ntreasurer, has lived in Kansas, and is one of the real pioneers of the\r\nState. Since a lad six years of age he has been a resident of Atchison\r\ncounty, and has lived to see the once wild and barren prairie become one\r\nof the garden spots in America, and has seen the towns and cities grow\r\nwithin the borders of the county where once was a wild, unbroken waste.\r\nWhen a boy he was taught by his father that the greatest returns from\r\nthe pursuit of agriculture could be obtained by the raising and feeding\r\nof live stock, and he has endeavored to follow his father’s teachings in\r\nthis respect and has met with success, resulting from following a\r\ndefinite plan of getting the best results from his efforts. He is a\r\ndescendant of a southern pioneer family, who were among the original\r\nsettlers of eastern Tennessee, and again were pioneers in Clay county,\r\nMissouri, early in the nineteenth century. It is a topic of interest to\r\ncompare the comfortable residence and farm buildings of Mr. Gragg, at\r\nthis day, to the log cabin in which he was reared, and the stock shed\r\nmade of poles and slough grass, which his father was forced by necessity\r\nto erect in the early days of the settlement of Kansas. Few families\r\nsettled in Lancaster township as early as the Graggs, and in point of\r\nyears of residence, James R. is probably the third oldest living settler\r\nof the township.\r\n\r\nJames R. Gragg was born February 5, 1851, in Clinton county, Missouri.\r\nHe is a son of Jefferson and Mary (White) Gragg, to whom fifteen\r\nchildren were born. Four children, two sons and two daughters, are still\r\nliving, as follows: Mrs. Mahala Martin, Gower, Mo.; James R.; Mrs. Alice\r\nMuks, near Oklahoma City, Okla.; and Bishop or Bascomb Gragg, Stafford,\r\nKan. The Graggs are of Irish descent. The father of James Gragg was born\r\nin 1814 in eastern Tennessee. When he was a child his parents removed to\r\nClay county, Missouri, where he grew up as a farmer. In the spring of\r\n1856 Jefferson Gragg came to Kansas and settled in Leavenworth, where he\r\nhad taken a claim. He sold this a year later and came to Atchison\r\ncounty, and preëmpted 160 acres in section 24, Lancaster township, on\r\nwhich James R. is now living. He paid $1.25 an acre. As soon as he took\r\ncharge of the land he built a log house, twelve feet square and also\r\nerected a hay barn with a slough-grass roof. He brought a covered wagon\r\nto Kansas and lived in it until the log house was ready for occupancy.\r\nDuring the border war he was forced to return to Missouri for three\r\nmonths, but at the end of that time came back to Kansas and continued to\r\nimprove his farm. It was slow work, as he did most of the plowing with\r\noxen and this took a great deal of time, but he was able to accumulate a\r\nlittle money slowly, and in ten years erected a better house on his\r\nplace. He had a hard fight for existence the first few years in the face\r\nof crop failures, droughts and grasshoppers, but when he retired, about\r\n1890, he owned 640 acres of land which he divided among his children,\r\nand lived with them until his death, April 10, 1910. His wife, the\r\nmother of James R. Gragg, was born in Clinton county, Missouri, in 1816,\r\nand died in 1912. She was the daughter of Robert White, and her mother\r\nbore the maiden name of Cooley. Both parents were members of the South\r\nMethodist church, and helped to organize and build the Bethel church in\r\nGrasshopper township, which was one of the early Methodist churches in\r\nKansas. Both parents are buried in old Huron cemetery.\r\n\r\nJames R. Gragg, the subject of this sketch, was reared on the farm where\r\nhe now lives, and attended school in Lancaster and Huron, Kan., although\r\nhis early educational opportunities were limited. In early days the\r\nfather and his son were stock buyers on a large scale. The father did\r\nthe actual buying, and the son had charge of the herds on the prairie.\r\nThey did a large business in trading and buying and selling stock, and\r\nthe son has continued this until the present time. James has always\r\nlived on the Gragg land and was with his father until the latter retired\r\nin 1890 and the land was divided. James later bought out the other heirs\r\nand now owns 1,040 acres in Atchison and Wabaunsee counties, 560 acres\r\nof this land being located in Atchison county, with three sets of farm\r\nbuildings. He gives a great deal of attention to the stock selling part\r\nof his business, and feeds and winters 150 head each winter. On December\r\n25, 1872, Mr. Gragg married Mrs. Viola A. Norris, who was born May 26,\r\n1855, in Buchanan county, Missouri. She is a daughter of David and\r\nMartha (Cook) Norris. The father’s family came from Kentucky and the\r\nmother’s from Indiana. Mr. and Mrs. Gragg have two children: Jefferson\r\nK., born February 23, 1875, in Atchison county, Kansas; married in\r\nOctober, 1894, to Ella Walls, and has two children, Paul, aged twenty\r\nyears, and George, aged twelve years. He is now engaged in the live\r\nstock commission business in Kansas City, Mo., and Arch, born May 3,\r\n1889, who is farming on the home place, married March 11, 1914, to Edna\r\nWilson, of Lancaster township, a daughter of J. E. Wilson. Jefferson,\r\nthe older son, completed a course in the Atchison Business College. Mr.\r\nGragg is a Democrat, and has been a member of the school board, and is\r\nnow treasurer of Lancaster township. He is a member of the Methodist\r\nchurch and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and Modern Woodmen of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           URI SEELEY KEITH.\r\n\r\nUri Seeley Keith is one of the grand old men of Atchison. His career has\r\nbeen interesting, and borders upon the romantic, when many incidents in\r\nwhich he has figured are recounted. A valiant soldier of the Union\r\nduring the Civil war, it fell to him to perform the arrest of\r\nVallandingham in Ohio when his activities in favor of the Confederacy\r\nhad rendered him obnoxious to the State and Federal governments. Few men\r\nin Atchison have had a more varied or active life than Mr. Keith. He was\r\nborn June 27, 1841, in Massillon, Ohio, the son of Fordyce M. and\r\nParthena J. (Seeley) Keith, natives of New York and the Western Reserve\r\nof Ohio, respectively. Mrs. Keith was a daughter of Uri Seeley. Fordyce\r\nM. Keith was born in 1816 and died May 14, 1906. He was a son of Ansell\r\nKeith, a native of New York. The Keith family is descended from two\r\nbrothers who were sons of General Keith, at one time a field marshal in\r\nthe Russian army. He was a Scotch-Englishman, who quarreled with Queen\r\nElizabeth and left England to take service under Peter the Great of\r\nRussia. His two sons immigrated to America in 1690, one settling in New\r\nYork and the other going to the Southland. Two branches of the family\r\nthus sprang from these sons of Marshal Keith. Brigadier General Keith\r\nserved under General Washington during the Revolution and the General\r\nlived at the Keith home in New York for a time. Ansell Keith served in\r\nthe War of 1812. The Seeley family originally settled in Connecticut.\r\nUri Seeley was born in 1791 and settled in the Western Reserve on a land\r\ngrant of 100 acres where he died. Ansell, the father of Fordyce M., and\r\ngrandfather of the subject of this sketch, settled in Lorain county,\r\nOhio, in 1832, near Elyria and was a contractor and builder. Data\r\nregarding the members of the family is as follows: Ansell Keith was born\r\nJune 24, 1786, and Betsy M., his wife, was born January 2, 1794; Uri\r\nSeeley was born May 25, 1791, and died August 10, 1877, and his wife,\r\nAbbey, was born October 23, 1792.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  U.

WILSON\r\n]\r\n\r\nFordyce M. Keith was born April 27, 1816, and died May 12, 1906. His\r\nwife, Parthena, was born August 4, 1816, and died at Seneca, Kan.,\r\nFebruary 18, 1893. He received an excellent education and was admitted\r\nto the practice of law in Ohio, practicing for some years at Massillon.\r\nHe served in the Union army, enlisting in the One Hundred and\r\nSeventeenth regiment, Ohio infantry, and later the First Ohio heavy\r\nartillery. His service extended throughout the war from August 30, 1862,\r\nto August 1, 1865. He was a major in the One Hundred and Seventeenth\r\nregiment, Ohio infantry, and was created a lieutenant colonel in the\r\nheavy artillery August 1, 1863. He came to Kansas in 1866 and practiced\r\nlaw in Brown county where he served as county attorney. In old age he\r\nresided with his granddaughter in Oklahoma. He was the father of the\r\nfollowing children: Uri Seeley; Fordyce M., Jr., who died in Pueblo,\r\nColo., August 1, 1900; Clarence M., and Herbert Brewster died in\r\ninfancy; Lamar Burrett, born February 22, 1847, and lives at Seneca,\r\nKan.\r\n\r\nUri Seeley Keith was educated in the common schools of his native State.\r\nHe enlisted April 20, 1861, when Lincoln issued his first call for\r\ntroops. His first enlistment was in Company I, Eighteenth regiment, Ohio\r\ninfantry, for a period of three months, which was extended to five\r\nmonths. He again enlisted in Company E, Eighty-seventh regiment, Ohio\r\ninfantry, June 2, 1862, for four months. November 4, 1862, he enlisted\r\nin Company K, One Hundred and Seventeenth regiment, Ohio infantry, for a\r\nperiod of three years, or until the close of the war. He was promoted to\r\nthe second lieutenancy of Company C, First Ohio heavy artillery,\r\nDecember 23, 1863. The One Hundred and Seventeenth regiment was\r\ntransferred to the heavy artillery organization May 2, 1863 with Mr.\r\nKeith as second lieutenant and later as first lieutenant of his company.\r\nHe was regimental quartermaster sergeant of the One Hundred and\r\nSeventeenth regiment, Ohio infantry, and received his final discharge at\r\nKnoxville, Tenn., July 25, 1865, and was mustered out at Camp Denison,\r\nOhio, August 1, 1865. This valiant soldier participated in the following\r\nengagements: Chickamauga, September 10–20, 1863; Knoxville, November 16\r\nto December 9, 1863; Campbell Station, October 16; Carter Station,\r\nDecember 21; Lowden, October 15, 1863; Rogersville, December 19;\r\nTaylorsville, December 19, 1863; Seaversville, October 9, 1864;\r\nCharleston, October 19, 1864; Cleveland, October 24; Columbus, October\r\n27; Franklin, November 30; Nashville, December 12 to 16, and Duck River,\r\nDecember 18, 1864. He served as quartermaster of the Second battalion of\r\nthe First Ohio heavy artillery from April 1, 1864, to the close of the\r\nwar. Other engagements in which he fought were: Rich Mountain, July 7,\r\n1861; Gainesville, July 24, 1861; Red House, July 29, 1861 (Eighteenth\r\nOhio volunteer infantry) and Harper’s Ferry, September 14 and 15, 1862;\r\nSouth Mountain, September 13, 1862; Antietam, September 17, 1862\r\n(Eighty-seventh Ohio volunteer infantry) Paintville, January 11, 1863;\r\nPeach Orchard, January 27, 1863 (One Hundred and Seventeenth Ohio\r\nvolunteer infantry). An interesting episode in Mr. Keith’s career which\r\nhas been published in various newspapers is worth recording. He was the\r\nman who arrested Vallandingham at Dayton, Ohio, May 1, 1863. Early in\r\n1863 while he was an officer in the heavy artillery, General Burnside,\r\nthen in command of the Department of the Ohio, issued general order\r\nNumber 38, which was especially obnoxious to southern sympathizers, the\r\nKnights of the Golden Circle, and Associated Sons of America, and\r\nkindred organizations which had for their object the placing of every\r\nobstacle in the path of the Federal Government and the overthrow of the\r\nUnion. Vallandingham made an incendiary speech at Mt. Vernon, Ohio, on\r\nMay 1. Captain Hutton of General Burnside’s staff was detailed to effect\r\nthe arrest of Vallandingham, who was to be transported to the rebel\r\nlines. Lieutenant Keith was second in command of the expedition. They\r\nreached Vallandingham’s home at midnight, and knocked at the door, but\r\nthe woman of the house stated that the object of their capture was not\r\nat home. Lieutenant Keith did not believe her and pushed open the door\r\nand rushed up stairs to find Vallandingham, who was in bed. When Keith\r\nbroke open the bed room door his prisoner rushed to the window and\r\ncalled “Asa,” presumably in search of assistance, but no one came to his\r\naid. He was then taken to Cincinnati and sent through the Union lines to\r\nthe Confederate general, Bragg, for safe keeping.\r\n\r\nMr. Keith came west to Doniphan county September 8, 1865, and located in\r\nthe town of White Cloud for a time and then came to Atchison. He bought\r\na farm a few miles west of White Cloud which he cultivated until 1872,\r\nand then followed railroading for a time. In 1872 he was in the employ\r\nof the United States Government on the Great Nemaha Indian reservation.\r\nIn 1875 he again returned to White Cloud and from there went to his\r\nfarm, remaining until 1885 when he engaged in the hotel business at\r\nHiawatha until 1890. He removed to Atchison in 1890, and was employed\r\nfor a number of years as inspector of city contract work. He has\r\nsuperintended practically all of the paving and contract work which has\r\nbeen done in the city except during the past few years since his\r\nretirement. Many miles of paving have been honestly done under Mr.\r\nKeith’s supervision and he has had charge of the building of practically\r\nall of the concrete culverts erected in the city. For four years he\r\nserved as deputy sheriff of Atchison county.\r\n\r\nMr. Keith was married September 11, 1866, to Mary Frances Grossman, who\r\nwas born in Massillon, Ohio, August 24, 1842, the daughter of Daniel and\r\nMartha Grossman, natives of Pennsylvania, and pioneer settlers in Ohio.\r\nThe Grossmans moved to Ohio in 1836 and both died in Massillon. To Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Keith have been born the following children: Minnie L. born\r\nJuly 24, 1867, wife of J. R. Bailey, of Enid, Okla., and the mother of\r\none child, Mildred, wife of Dr. Lee J. Render, of Falls Valley, Okla.,\r\nand who also has one child, Bailey Adrian; Mrs. Ruby V. Doyle, born\r\nApril 1, 1870, and residing in Lincoln, Neb., the mother of one child,\r\nHalbert K.; Edward C., and Charles R., born June 6, 1875, of whom\r\nCharles R. died May 24, 1898, and Edward C. married Elsie Schmitt,\r\nengaged in United States mail service. Mr. Keith’s daughter, Mrs.\r\nBailey, is a talented writer and has issued a volume of poems which has\r\ndecided literary merit. She is counted among the leading authors of the\r\n“New State” and is fast gaining a place in the world of letters.\r\n\r\nMr. Keith has always been aligned with the Republican party and has been\r\nactive in its councils during his long and busy life. He is a Mason and\r\na member of the Grand Army of the Republic, Post No. 93, having been\r\nquartermaster of the local post for the past eight years. He served as\r\npost commander at White Cloud, Hiawatha, and of E. C. Johnson post, of\r\nAtchison, which was later consolidated with Post No. 93. Few men can\r\nlook back over long years crowded with incidents and with such activity\r\nas has fallen to the lot of Uri S. Keith, one of the last of the Old\r\nGuard who offered their lives that the Union might be forever preserved.\r\nAs the years pass and time rolls on the ranks of those brave men who\r\nwore the blue are becoming thinner and their steps more feeble. It is\r\nonly the more vigorous who have survived thus far and Mr. Keith is one\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHARLES H. BURROWS.\r\n\r\nCharles H. Burrows, Union veteran and clerk in the Missouri Pacific\r\nrailroad offices at Atchison, has had a long and varied career in the\r\nrailway service of the country. He is a native of the Buckeye State and\r\nwas born at Cincinnati, November 19, 1843, a son of James H. and Nancy\r\nA. (Lynchard) Burrows, both of whom were descended from old American\r\nfamilies. James H. Burrows was born in Maryland and his wife was a\r\nnative of Kentucky. The Burrows family settled in America in about the\r\nyear 1647. There were at first two branches of the family, one of whom\r\nsettled in Maine and the other on the south shore of Maryland. The\r\ngreat-grandfather of Charles H. settled first in Maryland and here his\r\ngrandfather, William Burrows, was born and reared. The sons of the\r\nfamily were sea-faring men and several of the descendants of the first\r\nBurrows have been officers in the United States navy. Nancy A., wife of\r\nJames H., was a daughter of Mr. Lynchard of Virginia, who became a\r\npioneer settler of Kentucky, and married a member of the Talbot family,\r\nof Virginia. He had two sons and four daughters and came from Kentucky\r\nto Hamilton county, Ohio, in 1838. In 1845 James H. Burrows was married\r\nin Cincinnati where he made his residence. Upon the outbreak of the\r\nCivil war both father and son, C. H., enlisted. The family removed to\r\nSpringfield, Ill., in 1858 and here James H. operated a cooperage shop.\r\nAs before stated, father and son enlisted in the same regiment, the One\r\nHundred and Twenty-fourth Illinois volunteer infantry, on September 10,\r\n1862, for a period of three years. The father died in the Union hospital\r\nat Cairo, Ill., after his honorable discharge on account of sick\r\ndisability, in February, 1863. Charles H. fought in the battles of\r\nChampion Hills, Vicksburg, Spanish Fort, Blakely, and took part in many\r\nother engagements until the close of the war. He was also engaged in the\r\nMobile campaign. Charles H. was the eldest of a family of five children,\r\nnamely: Charles H., James died in 1856; Mrs. Alice A. Direen, of\r\nJacksonville, Ill.; William C., deceased; Emma D., wife of Judge Henry\r\nPhillips, of Beardstown, Ill.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 he, with whom this review is directly concerned, left the old\r\nhome in Illinois and began his railroading career which was eventually\r\nto end with his present berth in Atchison. Forty-two years of\r\nrailroading, or rather fifty years of railway service with the exception\r\nof two years in the practice of law at Mondamin, Ill., is the proud\r\nrecord of this sturdy patriot. During this long period he has served as\r\ntelegraph operator, superintendent of telegraph, engineer, brakeman,\r\nconductor, etc. He was in the employ of the Chicago & Alton railroad,\r\nthe Wabash, the Gilman, Clinton & Springfield railroads, while located\r\nat Springfield, Ill., and was in the employ of the Vandalia when it was\r\nbuilding out of St. Louis. As early as 1868 he was in the employ of the\r\nMissouri Pacific railroad and was with the Denver and Rio Grande in the\r\nearly days of its operation; was with the Ft. Scott & Memphis railroad\r\none year; the St. Louis & St. Joseph road; was station agent on the old\r\nHannibal & St. Joe road; served on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy\r\nrailroad in Missouri and Iowa; the Chicago & Northwestern; the Sioux\r\nCity & Pacific; the Fremont, Elkhorn & Missouri Valley roads. After a\r\nrailroad experience in the states of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska,\r\nKansas and Colorado, he came to Atchison in September of 1890, as a\r\nclerk in the offices of the Missouri Pacific railroad system.\r\n\r\nHe was married August 10, 1871, at Lawson, Mo., to Susan E. Morrow, a\r\nnative of Missouri, and daughter of Vincent Morrow. To this union has\r\nbeen born one child, Pearl, wife of Adolph Frailey. By a former marriage\r\nwith B. F. Shumalt, Mrs. Frailey had two children, Ruth E. and Frances\r\nShumalt. Mr. Burrows has been and is now an independent voter, not\r\nallied with any particular political party or creed. He is fraternally\r\nconnected with the Sons and Daughters of Justice, the Fraternal Order of\r\nEagles, and the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, and has served as\r\ncommander of the Grand Army Post, No. 93, of Atchison, for the past two\r\nyears. Commander Burrows has the great distinction of having been one of\r\nthe original organizers of the Grand Army of the Republic and has been\r\nprominent in the affairs of this great organization since 1866. In\r\nFebruary of 1866, he assisted in the organization of Springfield, Ill.,\r\nGrand Army Post, No. 2. He served as officer of the day when this noted\r\npost (the second in America) was organized.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JAMES EDWARD WILSON.\r\n\r\nJames Edward Wilson, farmer, of Lancaster township, Atchison county, was\r\nborn December 14, 1865, on the farm which he now manages. He is a son of\r\nCharles and Mary K. (Brown) Wilson, who were the parents of eleven\r\nchildren, as follows: Sarah E. died in infancy; Louise C. died when two\r\nyears old; William M., deceased; Andrew J., Hill City, Kan.; Martha E.,\r\ndeceased; Nancy J., deceased; James E., subject of this sketch; Julia A.\r\nMartin, Wabaunsee county, Kansas; Charles T., Atchison county, and\r\nSamuel H., deceased. The father, Charles Wilson, was born February 7,\r\n1827, in Bartholomew county, Indiana, a son of Martin and Elizabeth\r\n(Mitchell) Wilson, who migrated to Missouri. Charles Wilson left the\r\nfarm in Buchanan county, was married and came to Kansas. In 1855 he\r\nsettled on the farm which his son now owns in section 14, Lancaster\r\ntownship, Atchison county. The father with his wife and infant child\r\nwent through many hardships in their pioneering days.\r\n\r\nThe family came from Buchanan county, Missouri, in a covered wagon,\r\ndriving a yoke of oxen. He preëmpted 160 acres, the site of his son’s\r\npresent farm. He built a small log cabin to shelter his family, and,\r\nwith the aid of two other men, he began to break the prairie. This was\r\nslow work with oxen, and during the first year they cleared but ten\r\nacres each. Fifty acres of the farm was in fine wooded land along the\r\ncreek. This furnished them plenty of lumber with which to build their\r\ncabin and other buildings. They planted the land, which was in tillable\r\ncondition, in corn, and were soon able to live in some degree of\r\ncomfort, but it was still a wild country. An old trail ran near the\r\nfarm, now known as the “Military trail,” and the Indians following this\r\nfrequently camped along the trail near the farm. They prowled around the\r\nhouse frequently, and the father always kept close to his house to\r\nprotect his family from possible danger. Those were the true pioneer\r\ndays, and they had to go to Atchison for their provisions. It was a\r\nlonely trip, only one house being between the Wilson cabin and Atchison.\r\nBut in those days people only bought the barest necessities of life\r\nwhich were all that they could afford. They paid two dollars a bushel\r\nfor corn meal during the second spring there. Wild game was plentiful\r\nand furnished much of the food. Badgers and wolves were numerous and\r\ngave danger to the sheep of the pioneers. Many nights were spent with\r\nloaded gun within reach in preparedness for the wolves which could be\r\nheard howling about. On the trips to Atchison to trade travelers and\r\npioneers often stopped at Mormon Grove for a rest. The place was about\r\nseven miles west of Atchison, and took its name from the fact that the\r\nMormons, on their way to Utah, frequently camped in this grove over\r\nnight. Travelers along this road always watered their horses from the\r\npond there.\r\n\r\nAfter two years the settlers began to feel the need of educational\r\nadvantages for their children, as there was no school near enough for\r\nthe children of the pioneers to attend. For the two years they had lived\r\nhere they had no school advantages, and the men of the neighborhood\r\njoined together and built a log school house. It was in the district now\r\nknown as old Huron school district No. 24. A postoffice also was\r\nestablished near the school house, but when the railroad was built\r\nthrough that section of the county, the postoffice was moved to Huron,\r\nwhere the station was located.\r\n\r\nCharles Wilson died in 1897, at the age of seventy years. His wife, Mary\r\nK. Wilson, was born October 31, 1831, in eastern Tennessee. She was a\r\ndaughter of Joseph and Polly (McCurry) Brown. They were natives of\r\nTennessee. The mother is now living with her son, James, the subject of\r\nthis sketch. She had a great deal to do with the success of her husband.\r\nWhen she came into the wild country with her young husband she was\r\nfacing a new life, and one which was to test her courage and strength,\r\nbut she was equal to the occasion. She toiled early and late on the new\r\nfarm and helped shear sheep and spun wool. The paternal grandparents of\r\nJames Wilson were Martin and Elizabeth (Mitchell) Wilson, both natives\r\nof Indiana.\r\n\r\nJames Wilson was reared on the farm where he now resides. He was\r\neducated in the district school and went to work on his father’s farm,\r\nand is now farming the place, renting it from his mother. He operates\r\nabout 115 acres of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson was married in 1880 to Martha Louisa Culpepper, who was born\r\nin Dallas county, Iowa, September 5, 1867. She is a daughter of Benjamin\r\nand Amanda (Lowery) Culpepper, natives of Alabama. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson\r\nare the parents of eleven children: Charlie, deceased; Anna Edwards,\r\nDardanelle, Ark.; Archibald, living at home; Edna Gragg, Lancaster\r\ntownship, Atchison county, Kansas; Frank, living at home; Marie, at\r\nhome; Eva, Thelma, Leslie and Vera, all living with their parents, and\r\none child died in infancy. Mr. Wilson is a Republican and is now a\r\nmember of the school board for his district. He attends church, although\r\nhe is not a member of any denomination. Mrs. Wilson, mother of James E.,\r\nis the oldest living pioneer settler of Lancaster township.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FREDERICK W. KOESTER.\r\n\r\nFrederick W. Koester is a native of Atchison, born April 6, 1860. He is\r\na son of Fred and Anna (Bertha) Koester, the former a native of Germany\r\nand the latter of Zurich, Switzerland. The mother immigrated to America\r\nwhen she was a young girl, coming to this country with her mother. Fred\r\nKoester, the father, was born in Minden, Germany, January 18, 1835, and\r\ncame to America when he was about twenty-one years of age. He landed in\r\nNew Orleans, but remained there only a short time when he came up the\r\nMississippi river by boat, and located at St. Louis. He remained there\r\nbut a short time, however, when he went to St. Joseph, Mo. While there\r\nhe learned the barber’s trade, and in 1857 came to Atchison, Kan., and\r\nestablished one of the first barber shops in the city. He was an\r\nindustrious and thrifty man and although not highly educated, he was a\r\nman of unusual foresight and good judgment. Soon after coming to\r\nAtchison he began to invest his savings in real estate and became one of\r\nthe extensive property owners of the city in the early days. He built\r\nseveral residences which he sold at a good profit and he built one of\r\nthe first brick houses in Atchison. He also built the first pressed\r\nbrick house in the city. The building is still standing and is known as\r\nthe Koester house situated on Second street, between Commercial and\r\nKansas streets. This was considered one of the magnificent residences of\r\nAtchison in the early seventies. Fred Koester owned a number of business\r\nplaces in Atchison as well as several residences. Frederick W. Koester\r\nis the older of a family of two. His sister, Susie Bertha, is now the\r\nwife of Carl Hachette, and resides in San Francisco, Cal.\r\n\r\nFrederick W. Koester attended the public schools of Atchison, and later\r\nwas a student in St. Benedict’s College, and also attended the Jesuits’\r\nCollege, St. Louis, Mo. His father had advanced ideas in regard to\r\neducation, and endeavored to give his children the best that could be\r\nobtained. After completing school F. W. Koester began life as a clerk in\r\nD. C. Newcomb’s dry goods store at Atchison. He remained there but a\r\nshort time, however, when he went to work in his father’s barber shop\r\nand later opened a six chair shop of his own. He then went on the road\r\nas traveling salesman for a barber supply house, and was thus engaged\r\nfor seven years. He went to California in 1886 where he was employed as\r\ntimekeeper for a railroad contractor.\r\n\r\nMr. Koester was married in 1883 to Miss Bertha Bracke, a daughter of\r\nAlbert Bracke, an Atchison county pioneer, who was engaged in freighting\r\nacross the plains in the early days. Later, he was engaged in a cattle\r\nand butchering business in Atchison and was a very extensive dealer.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Koester are the parents of two children, Albert, born on\r\nJanuary 21, 1885, is in the employ of the Seaton Foundry, Atchison, and\r\nFrederick William, Jr., born July 25, 1895, in San Francisco, is a\r\nstudent in Kansas University, department of journalism, and during his\r\nvacations is connected with the _Atchison Champion_ as a reporter. Mr.\r\nKoester was appointed by Governor Hodges secretary of the Kansas State\r\nBarbers’ Board in April, 1913, serving two years. He is a member of the\r\nKnights of Pythias, the Red Men, and secretary of the insurance\r\ndepartment of Golden Cross. He and his family are members of the\r\nChristian Science church. Mrs. Koester died October 13, 1904, and on\r\nOctober 23, 1915, Mr. Koester was united in marriage with Miss Lillie\r\nBarth Hood, a native of Kentucky, and daughter of J. H. Hood, of\r\nMcCloud, Okla.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHARLES MYERS.\r\n\r\nCharles Myers, farmer, stockman and contractor, of Lancaster township,\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, was born May 13, 1864, in Buchanan county\r\nMissouri. He is a son of Augusta and Hulcia (Snyder) Myers, and one of\r\nnine children, seven of whom are living. The father was born in Germany\r\nin 1818 and left there with his parents when a young man, the family\r\nsettling in Cincinnati, Ohio. At the age of twenty-two he came to St.\r\nJoseph, Mo., and learned the carpenter’s trade. Later he engaged in\r\nfarming in Missouri, and came to Atchison county, Kansas, and bought the\r\nold Captain Evans farm in Shannon township. He improved it considerably\r\nand then sold it, and moved to Atchison, where he resided until his\r\ndeath in 1905. The mother was born in Indiana. She died in 1903, at the\r\nage of seventy-four years.\r\n\r\nCharles Myers, the subject of this sketch, was reared on his father’s\r\nfarm in Shannon township and attended the district school. He worked for\r\nhis father until he was twenty years old, and then rented land in\r\nDoniphan county, Kansas, and farmed for himself, and later came to\r\nAtchison county, where he rented a farm for two years. Having\r\naccumulated some capital, he bought 120 acres in section 13, Lancaster\r\ntownship, and farmed this for sixteen years, meanwhile making extensive\r\nimprovements. He sold this land and bought 160 acres in section 23,\r\nLancaster township, in 1904. The farm was comparatively unimproved and\r\nhe set to work building the place up. He erected a large, modern, nine\r\nroom, brick house, superintending the work himself. He also built an\r\nexcellent barn and a commodious ice house. These buildings were planned\r\nby Mr. Myers, who had learned the carpenter’s trade at odd times. He\r\nselected the materials used in the construction and by his careful\r\nsupervision thus insured the best of buildings. This work comes natural\r\nto Mr. Myers, although he has never spent much time at the work, but it\r\nwas so easy for him that he just naturally drifted into it. Whenever he\r\nhad any work to be done he personally took it in hand. Other important\r\nimprovements were made by Mr. Myers. Several additions to his farm land\r\nwere made, and he now owns 240 acres of good tillable farm land. Mr.\r\nMyers also keeps graded stock and takes pride in keeping up his breeds.\r\nBesides these activities Mr. Myers holds stock in the Independent\r\nHarvester Company of Plano, Ill.\r\n\r\nHe was married to Eva Kenbal in 1897. Mrs. Myers was born August 19,\r\n1867, in Ohio, and is a daughter of Nelson Kenbal. Eight children have\r\nbeen born to Mr. and Mrs. Myers: Ora (Snyder), Frazer, Mo.; Edna\r\n(Taylor), Lancaster township, Atchison county, Kansas; Merrel, Augusta,\r\nGlen, Hubert, Irene, Lafayette, all living at home. Mr. Myers is a\r\nRepublican in politics and has served on the school board of his\r\ndistrict. He belongs to the Baptist church, and is a member of the\r\nModern Woodmen of America. Mr. Myers, in addition to his occupation as a\r\nfarmer and stockman, has found time for constructing several buildings\r\nin Atchison county, and has been remarkably successful in his\r\nconstruction work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GEORGE H. T. SCHAEFER.\r\n\r\nGeorge H. T. Schaefer, contractor and builder, has achieved such a\r\nreputation in his avocation during his more than thirty years of\r\nresidence in Atchison, as to place him in the front rank of artisans in\r\nhis adopted city. History is constantly repeating itself, when we\r\nchronicle the fact that “from small beginnings, great things have\r\ngrown.” Mr. Schaefer began contracting in a small way, after quitting\r\nthe first job which he held in Atchison. The results of his handiwork\r\nare now seen on every hand, and include the most stately and costly\r\nbuildings of the city and structures throughout Kansas and Nebraska.\r\nThrough all of his success Mr. Schaefer has remained the same,\r\nunassuming, plain citizen, whose motto has been, “honest work for honest\r\nmoney.” There are few men in his profession who can point to a more\r\nsuccessful career, and who can look back over long years spent in\r\nerecting abiding places for mankind, and realize that every contract was\r\nfulfilled faithfully and the work well and consistently done to the\r\nsatisfaction of the owners.\r\n\r\nG. H. T. Schaefer was born November 11, 1857, in Indianapolis, Ind., and\r\nis a son of Rev. J. George and Minnie Schaefer. His father was a native\r\nof Stuttgart, Germany, and his mother of Hamburg, Germany. Both came to\r\nthis country in youth with their respective parents. The father was\r\neducated for the Lutheran ministry, and in 1863 left Indianapolis and\r\ntook charge of a church at Lanesville, Ind., twelve miles from New\r\nAlbany, on the stage route in Indiana. From that time on he filled\r\nvarious charges and died in the midst of his pastoral labors in New\r\nBoston, Ind. The mother now resides in Atchison. He, with whom this\r\nreview directly concerns, left the parental roof when thirteen years of\r\nage and went to Indianapolis, where he learned the trade of carpenter.\r\nAfter serving his apprenticeship he spent two years in the vicinity of\r\nhis father’s home at New Boston, working for an old German contractor.\r\nThis experience was invaluable, inasmuch as his employer took contracts\r\nfor erecting barns, churches and bridges from the standing timber. The\r\nfuture contractor here learned to create buildings from the virgin\r\ntimber of the forests. Desiring to gain a wider experience in his\r\ncalling, in 1876 he went to Evansville, Ind., then, as now, an important\r\nriver city. He spent one year in this city, and during that time\r\nwitnessed the great cyclone which swept this section of the country and\r\ndestroyed lives and many buildings. Mt. Carmel, Ill., was badly wrecked,\r\nand he arrived on the scene of the disaster in time to help bury the\r\ndead and assist in the rebuilding of the city. In 1879 he went to\r\nGreenville, Miss., and during the winter the yellow fever, which had\r\nbeen epidemic in New Orleans, broke out in Greenville, and he managed to\r\ncatch the last boat leaving the wharf for St. Louis. From here he went\r\nto Kansas City, but no sooner did he set foot on the streets of this\r\ngrowing metropolis than he was besieged by real estate men who wanted to\r\nsell him property. He became disgusted with Kansas City and took a train\r\nfor Atchison. Here he purchased a ticket for a point 200 miles west on\r\nthe Central Branch railroad and landed at Cawker City. Upon alighting\r\nfrom the train and making inquiries about work he was informed that,\r\ninasmuch as he did not belong to any lodges, and had no connections in\r\nthe western town, he could get no work. However, he got a job and was\r\nkept busily employed for two years, building in the surrounding country.\r\nHe erected dwellings and business houses in Jewell and Mitchell\r\ncounties, at a time when the country was in the initial stage of its\r\ndevelopment. He invested his savings in property, only to see his hopes\r\nof gaining a permanent competence swept away, when the hot winds came\r\nand ruined the corn crop and scorching everything in its path. Mr.\r\nSchaefer promptly left and decided to locate in Omaha. On his way\r\neastward he drew matches to decide upon his stopping place and the\r\nchoice fell to Atchison. This was in 1882. On reaching this city he saw\r\nin the _Atchison Globe_ an advertisement, reading: “Competent man wanted\r\nto take charge of building,” etc. The following morning he applied for\r\nthe job, and was given the post of foreman by Mr. Jones, a contractor,\r\nwho had undertaken to erect the Presbyterian church, a stone structure.\r\nHe received two dollars per day for his services as foreman, with the\r\nunderstanding that his employer was to advance his wages according to\r\nhis worth as a foreman. As foreman he did not receive any more pay than\r\nthe men who were working under him; consequently, when he had supervised\r\nthe erection of the stone structure as far as the roof, he quit the job,\r\ndespite the fact that his boss offered him three dollars per day to\r\ncontinue working for him. Mr. Schaefer’s first contract in Atchison was\r\nthe erection of a barn on south Third street. Since his first job he has\r\nnot lacked for contracts, and he has been employed repeatedly by the\r\nsame patrons who were well satisfied with the work done. His most\r\nnotable building operations included the magnificent Ingalls high school\r\nbuilding, erected at a cost of $125,000; the G. C. Wattles residence,\r\nthe Bradley residence, the Blish, Mize Silliman building, costing\r\n$125,000; three double officers’ quarters at Ft. Leavenworth; thirty\r\nchurch edifices in Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska; the Presbyterian\r\nchurch in Ottawa, Kan., and the Masonic Temple in Atchison, built at a\r\ncost of $65,000, and completed in December of 1915. He employs from ten\r\nto seventy-five skilled men, as occasion requires. He formerly operated\r\na large planing mill on Eighth street, which was destroyed by fire in\r\n1913. Mr. Schaefer was married in 1884 to Lizzie Jacobs, of Atchison,\r\nKan. To them have been born the following children: Clara, wife of John\r\nFrommer, Oak street, Atchison; Minnie, wife of John Krusemark, 915 North\r\nEleventh street; Etta, wife of Albert Frommer, St. Paul, Minn.; Corrine,\r\nwife of Paul Smith, merchant, of Atchison; Julia, Edwin, Laura, and\r\nRuth, at home with their parents. Edwin is a machinist in the employ of\r\nthe Railway Specialty Company. Mrs. Schaefer was a daughter of J. H. and\r\nCatharine Jacobs, who came from Germany in 1860, accompanied by their\r\nthree children: Henry, deceased; Mrs. Schaefer, and John E., and a son,\r\nConrad V., was born here. The Jacobs first located in Pennsylvania, and\r\nthen in Ft. Wayne, Ind., removing from there to Illinois in 1865, and\r\ncoming to Atchison in 1867. J. H. Jacobs was employed by the Hixon\r\nLumber Company, and died February 8, 1896, at the age of seventy-two\r\nyears. His wife died December 26, 1895, aged seventy-three years.\r\n\r\nPolitically. Mr. Schaefer is an independent Republican, and served one\r\nterm as city councilman from the Fifth ward. He is a member of the\r\nLutheran church, belongs to no lodges, and is essentially a home man\r\nwhen he is not engaged in building. His investments are principally in\r\nAtchison real estate and Texas farm lands. His handsome residence at 911\r\nNorth Eleventh street was remodeled after his own ideas and presents an\r\nattractive appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AMEL MARKWALT.\r\n\r\nAmel Markwalt, farmer, of Lancaster township, Atchison county, Kansas,\r\nwas born in Germany July 14, 1864. He is a son of Gottlieb and Minnie\r\n(Schraum) Markwalt, and was one of five children, as follows: Gustave,\r\nManistee, Mich.; Augusta, address unknown; Amelia (Lidkye), widow,\r\nManistee, Mich.; William, Manistee, Mich.; and Amel, the subject of this\r\nsketch. The parents were both German, and died when Amel was but five\r\nyears of age. He knows nothing of his parents, except that his father\r\nwas in the German war of 1866, when the Prussians were fighting the\r\nAustrians.\r\n\r\nThe schooling of Amel was neglected, owing to the death of his parents,\r\nand he spent his youth working on a farm in Germany. In 1882 he sailed\r\nfor America, and upon arriving in this country he went to work in the\r\nlumber mills at Manistee, Mich., remaining there three years. He then\r\ncame to Atchison, Kan., and worked in the Central Branch railroad shops\r\nas a laborer. He did various kinds of work of a mechanical nature during\r\nhis six years of employment there. He then engaged in the retail oil\r\nbusiness for himself, and finding this profitable he enlarged his\r\nbusiness to include the selling of ice. A few years later he sold his\r\nbusiness, and in 1903 bought 160 acres of land in Lancaster township and\r\nmoved there the following year, where he has since resided. He has built\r\na fine residence and a barn since buying the land, and has a two-acre\r\norchard. His barn is an excellent one, with a capacity of fifty tons of\r\nhay.\r\n\r\nAmel Markwalt was married in 1885 to Augusta Stolp, who was born in\r\nGermany August 2, 1865, and left her native land in 1883 and came to\r\nAtchison, Kan. She is a daughter of August and Charlotte (Weisgean)\r\nStolp, both now deceased. Her father came to Atchison, Kan., in 1884.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Markwalt have six children: Ida, wife of J. Ziegler,\r\nNortonville, Kan.; William, living at home; Henry, deceased; Charlotte,\r\nElsie, and Otto, living at home. Mr. Markwalt does not affiliate himself\r\nwith any political party, believing that he can vote more\r\nconscientiously by voting independently. He is a member of the German\r\nLutheran church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          RUFUS BENTON PEERY.\r\n\r\nDr. Rufus Benton Peery, president of Midland College, Atchison, is a\r\ntrue type of scholarly and progressive educator, one of that class of\r\nmen who seem fitted or destined for the high places, and are adapted by\r\nprofound learning and natural endowments to be instructors and leaders\r\nof the youth of the land. His work as the head of Midland College is\r\nattracting favorable attention. He has won fame as a lecturer and\r\nachieved a measure of renown as an author. Endowed with inherent powers\r\nof leadership, he occupies a place among the educators of the nation\r\nwhich is unquestioned, and he is universally recognized as a man of\r\nbrilliant attainments and a strong personality. Although he has occupied\r\nhis present position but a few years, during that time Dr. Perry has\r\ndone much toward advancing the interests of Midland College and pushing\r\nthis institution forward to its rightful place among the seats of\r\nlearning in the Middle West.\r\n\r\nDr. Perry is a native of Virginia, born April 9, 1868, at Burke’s\r\nGarden, and is a son of Thomas and Sarah Henrietta (Repass) Peery. His\r\nfather was a farmer and stockman, who eventually became an extensive\r\nbuyer and shipper of live stock in Virginia and Tennessee. He traveled\r\nover the region in quest of cattle and other live stock, buying it up\r\nand shipping train loads to the New York City markets. Rufus B. early\r\nlearned to do farm work and assisted his father as other boys have been\r\nwont to do on the farm. After he had entered college he became his\r\nfather’s assistant in the live stock business during his vacations, and\r\nthus earned the money to continue with his studies. During his boyhood\r\non the farm he raised a fine mare named “Gypsy” which was the apple of\r\nhis eye. He became ambitious to enter college, but had not the means to\r\nmake the start. His only recourse seemed to be to part with “Gypsy,” and\r\nthus get the funds to realize his ambition. He sold his favorite for the\r\nsum of $125, and was enabled to matriculate in Roanoke College, Salem,\r\nVa., from which institution he was graduated with the degree of A. B. in\r\n1890. He received his Master’s degree from Roanoke in 1895.\r\n\r\nImbued with a desire to enter the ministry, he continued his studies in\r\nthe theological seminary at Greensburg, Pa., for the next two years, and\r\nwas ordained in the English Lutheran ministry in 1892. Actuated by a\r\ndesire to assist the Japanese people, he became a missionary and\r\nremained in the Orient from 1892 to 1903. For four years he was\r\nprofessor of theology in Japan, and traveled extensively in the Orient,\r\nincluding the Chinese Empire. Being a close student and observer of\r\ncondition in the lands which he visited while pursuing his missionary\r\ntasks, he was enabled to write entertainingly, the results of his\r\nobservations, and embody them in an interesting volume “Gist of Japan,”\r\nin 1897, which has run through eight editions. He has also written and\r\npublished a volume entitled “Lutherans in Japan,” issued in 1900. His\r\n“Lectures to Young Men” (Japanese) was issued in 1902. Dr. Peery is a\r\nregular contributor to religious and secular journals. His work has\r\ndecided literary merit, and he has attained high rank as a writer on\r\nreligious subjects. In the year 1895 he received the degree of Ph. D.\r\nfrom the Pennsylvania College at Gettysburg. He took the non-resident\r\ncourse in theology and homiletics in Chicago University from 1898 to\r\n1901. In 1909 Dr. Peery received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from\r\nMidland College. Upon his return from the far East he lectured in\r\nAmerica on Oriental and missionary subjects from 1903 to 1905. In 1905\r\nhe received a call and accepted the pastorate of St. Paul’s Lutheran\r\nChurch at Denver. He had charge of the Denver church until 1912 when he\r\ncame to Atchison and became president of Midland College. While in\r\nDenver he served as president of the Denver Ministerial Association from\r\n1909 to 1910, inclusive. Dr. Peery is a trustee of the Tabitha Home at\r\nLincoln, Neb.; a member of the Red Cross Society of Japan; member of the\r\nSons of the American Revolution Society, and the Phi Gamma Delta.\r\n\r\nHe was married to Letita Rich, of Wytheville, Va., August 21, 1905. To\r\nMr. and Mrs. Peery have been born six sons, namely: Harold Rich, Thomas\r\nBenton and Rob Roy, born in Japan; Paul Denver, and William Wallace,\r\nborn in Denver, Colo.; Donald Lee, born in Atchison. Dr. Perry, like\r\nmany other college heads, began at the bottom rung of the ladder, and is\r\nessentially self-made. His first teaching experience was in the district\r\nschools of his native State. While a student at college he served as\r\nprivate tutor to the student son of a wealthy man and thus earned\r\nsufficient funds to continue his studies. His father gave him a share of\r\nthe proceeds of the live stock business which he earned in New York\r\nCity, during his vacations. Nothing develops the individual more than\r\nthe necessity of striving for himself, and thus developing his own\r\npowers by combining the gaining of a livelihood with the attaining of a\r\nhigher education. Dr. Peery’s aspirations have been noble, and he has\r\nbeen actuated by the high and unselfish purpose of being of service to\r\nhis fellow men. Atchison is proud of Midland College and the great work\r\nbeing done within its walls, and the reputation of the college is\r\ngrowing under Dr. Peery’s management.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOHN L. RATERMAN.\r\n\r\nFrom office boy to manager for one of the most widely known concerns in\r\nthe United States, or the civilized world, is the story of the life of\r\nhim of whom this review is written. The history of J. L. Raterman,\r\nmanager for R. G. Dun & Company, Mercantile Agency, shows what can be\r\naccomplished by beginning at the lowest rung of the ladder, learning\r\nevery detail of the business, and eventually fitting himself for the\r\nimportant and responsible position of manager.\r\n\r\nThe business of R. G. Dun & Company was first established in Atchison in\r\n1886, with G. T. Bolman as manager. Other managers succeeded Mr. Bolman\r\nin the course of time, but Mr. Raterman has held the position longer\r\nthan any of his predecessors. He began as office boy in 1890, when but\r\nfourteen years of age, it being necessary for him to leave his school\r\nstudies when a pupil of the sixth grade. During his idle moments around\r\nthe office, young Raterman practiced on the typewriter, and it was not\r\nlong until he was able to do typist’s work efficiently and\r\nsatisfactorily. He was soon promoted and became a regular typist, and\r\nmastered shorthand at the end of three years of study. Seven years later\r\nhe was advanced to the post of chief clerk, and in 1900 was promoted to\r\nthe important post of manager of the Atchison branch of R. G. Dun &\r\nCompany. As manager, Mr. Raterman travels over seven counties,\r\ncollecting necessary data regarding the business concerns of his\r\nterritory, including the six counties of northeast Kansas and DeKalb\r\ncounty, Missouri. He is personally acquainted with practically every\r\nbusiness man in his district.\r\n\r\nJ. L. Raterman was born in Atchison, Kan., October 25, 1876, a son of\r\nJohn and Elizabeth (Myers) Raterman, both of whom were born in Germany,\r\nimmigrated to this country in youth and were married in Cincinnati,\r\nOhio. John Raterman came to Atchison in 1857, and was one of the well\r\nknown pioneer merchants of the city, operating a grocery store here in\r\nthe early days. He conducted his grocery store for twenty-five years,\r\nand died December 21, 1902. Mrs. Raterman is living in Atchison at the\r\nadvanced age of eighty years. Mr. and Mrs. Raterman left a family of\r\nseven children.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ULYSSES B. SHARPLESS.\r\n\r\nUlysses B. Sharpless, treasurer of Atchison county, is one of the most\r\nsuccessful citizens and business men of the county. He is the son of\r\npioneer parents. Reared on a pioneer farm, successful as a merchant and\r\npublic official, he is universally recognized as one of the most\r\ninfluential men of Atchison county today. Mr. Sharpless is a descendant\r\nof old American stock, his ancestors having been among the original 100\r\nQuaker families brought over from England by William Penn, and colonized\r\nnear and within the city of Philadelphia, in 1682. Joseph Sharpless, the\r\ndirect ancestor of U. B. Sharpless, erected a stone house on the\r\nancestral farm of the family in 1700, near the city of Chester, Pa.,\r\nwhich is still standing in an excellent state of preservation. One room\r\nof this old and stanch dwelling is still in exactly the same condition\r\nas the original builder left it. The timbers and boards of this house\r\nwere drawn together by means of wooden pins instead of nails.\r\n\r\nU. B. Sharpless was born January 18, 1870, in Delaware, a son of\r\nBenjamin T. and Susan (Green) Sharpless, the former of whom was a native\r\nof Delaware, and the latter a native of Pennsylvania. The family resided\r\nin Delaware until 1878 and then migrated to the West, settling on a farm\r\nnear Pardee in Atchison county, Kansas. Here Benjamin T. lived and\r\nreared his family of six children, as follows: Mrs. Cora E. (Burdick),\r\ndeceased; Mrs. Olivia R. (Pfouts), deceased; Mrs. Susan Ella (Shifflet),\r\nof Atchison; Ulysses B., with whom this narrative is directly concerned;\r\nCarrie died in infancy; Mrs. Emma M. Hulings, Center township, Atchison\r\ncounty. Benjamin Sharpless died in 1894, and the mother of the foregoing\r\nchildren departed this life in 1908.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  C. M. VOELKER,\r\n  County Clerk.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  U. B. SHARPLESS,\r\n  County Treasurer.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  S. S. KING,\r\n  County Commissioner.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHAS. T. GUNDY,\r\n  City Judge.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe of whom this review is written was eight years of age when the\r\nSharpless family came to Atchison county. He was reared to young manhood\r\non his father’s farm and learned to cultivate the soil under the\r\ntutelage of his father, who was a successful farmer. He was educated in\r\nthe common schools and early learned to apply his education to the best\r\nadvantage for himself. When twenty-one years of age he obtained his\r\nfirst position as manager of a general store at Monrovia, Kan. This\r\nposition entailed a number of duties which kept him busily employed for\r\na number of years. From 1891 to 1903 Mr. Sharpless managed the Monrovia\r\nstore, served as postmaster, and performed the duties of station agent\r\nfor the railroad company. However, he found time to take an interest in\r\npolitics and became active in the affairs of the Republican party when\r\nyet a young man. In 1903 he removed to Effingham, Kan., and engaged in\r\nthe hardware and implement and grain business with considerable success.\r\nHe still retains his interest in this business, although now a resident\r\nof Atchison. Mr. Sharpless has also become a land owner in the county\r\nand has farm lands near Effingham.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1892 to Sadie A. Cook, born and reared in Atchison\r\ncounty, and a daughter of Thomas F. and Margaret Cook, who were pioneer\r\nsettlers of this county, coming here from Missouri in 1860. To Mr. and\r\nMrs. Sharpless have been born five children: Gladys A., Margaret S.,\r\nEdith Aubine died at the age of seven years; Lois A., and Alice Marie.\r\nAll of the living children are attending the Atchison public schools.\r\n\r\nThe civic and political career of Mr. Sharpless has been an interesting\r\none and he has risen from the rank and file of the Republican party to\r\nbecome one of the recognized leaders of his party in Atchison county and\r\nKansas. His first civic office was as police judge of Effingham. He also\r\nserved a term as mayor of that city. He was elected a member of the\r\nState legislature from legislative district No. 3, in Atchison county in\r\n1910 and again elected to succeed himself in 1912. He was also a member\r\nof the Atchison County High School board and served as treasurer of this\r\norganization. In the fall election of 1914 he was elected to the office\r\nof county treasurer by a large and handsome majority—evidence of his\r\ngreat personal popularity among all classes of citizens. He assumed the\r\nduties of the treasurer’s office in October of 1915, and is bestowing\r\nthe same care and application in the discharge of his public duties in\r\nthis capacity as he has always taken in the conduct of his personal\r\nbusiness affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Sharpless is affiliated with the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons,\r\nBlue Lodge, No. 48, and is a Knights Templar and Royal Arch Mason. He is\r\npast noble grand of Spartan Lodge, No. 250, Independent Order of Odd\r\nFellows, of Effingham, Kan., and is a member of the Modern Woodmen of\r\nAmerica, of the latter city. He is also fraternally allied with the\r\nBenevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the Fraternal Order of Eagles,\r\nand the Fraternal Aid Union of Atchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CONRAD M. VOELKER.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a distinction to be known as the youngest county clerk,\r\nand in all probability the youngest county official ever elected in the\r\nState of Kansas. Such is C. M. Voelker, the efficient and justly popular\r\ncounty clerk of Atchison county. Political honors and preferment rarely\r\ncome to a really young man, unless he is especially qualified for the\r\nwork, and has a host of friends who are willing and able to support him\r\nand his candidacy. Although young in years, Mr. Voelker is performing\r\nhis duties in a manner which would reflect distinct credit upon an older\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nConrad M. Voelker is a native of Atchison county, having been born May\r\n20, 1889, on a farm, four miles north of Atchison, in Shannon township.\r\nHis father is Conrad Walker, who was born in Germany November 20, 1856,\r\na son of Karl and Christiana Voelker, who immigrated to America in 1861,\r\nand settled on a farm, two miles north of the city, where he operated a\r\ndairy and truck farm until his demise. To Karl and Christiana Voelker\r\nwere born the following children: Conrad; Mrs. Joseph Biddle, of\r\nAtchison; Henry, residing in New Orleans; Karl Voelker was twice\r\nmarried, Mrs. S. L. Loyd, of Shannon township, being a daughter of the\r\nsecond marriage. Conrad, father of C. M. Voelker, was reared to manhood\r\nin Atchison county, and when he became of age, settled on a 160 acre\r\nfarm, four miles north of Atchison, which is now one of the best\r\nimproved farms in the State of Kansas. For a number of years he\r\nspecialized in the cultivation of cabbage, making a success of the\r\nventure, and accumulated considerable money. He became known far and\r\nwide as the “Cabbage King” of Kansas, always having the first cabbage on\r\nthe market, and shipped the product of his fields to points in Kansas\r\nand Nebraska in carload lots. The Voelkers have a beautiful, well\r\nappointed home, with excellent out buildings. Conrad Voelker married\r\nJennie Mueller, who was born in Cooper county, Missouri, November 15,\r\n1862, a daughter of German parents. To Conrad Voelker and wife were born\r\nthe following children: Fred C. W., a farmer, living north of Atchison;\r\nConrad M. The Voelkers are members of the Lutheran church.\r\n\r\nConrad M., with whom this narrative is directly concerned, was educated\r\nprimarily in the district schools, his education being supplemented with\r\none year’s study in the German school in Atchison, and a course in\r\nMidland College, where he was graduated with the degree of Bachelor of\r\nScience in 1909. He then completed a course in commerce and bookkeeping\r\nin the Atchison Business College. While a sophomore of Midland College\r\nhe won first honors in the oratorical contest, and represented his alma\r\nmater at the State oratorical contest, held in Salina, Kan. While yet a\r\nstudent he received the appointment of deputy county clerk under Edward\r\nIverson, March 13, 1910. He was elected to the office on the Republican\r\nticket in November, 1912, and again elected without any opposition in\r\nthe fall of 1914.\r\n\r\nA more intimate personal view of this rising young man was published in\r\nthe _Atchison Champion_ just previous to assuming the duties of his\r\noffice after his election:\r\n\r\n“Conrad M. Voelker, county clerk elect, when he takes office January 1,\r\n1913, will have the distinction of being the youngest man ever elected\r\nto the office of county clerk in Kansas. Mr. Voelker, while he appears\r\nto be much older, is but twenty-three years old. He is popular; this was\r\nproven by the fact that he was elected by a majority of 955 votes.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Voelker is the son of Conrad Voelker. He was born four miles north\r\nof Atchison. He never passes up an opportunity to learn something. When\r\nfour years old Mr. Voelker started to school. He was graduated from the\r\neighth grade at ten years of age, and in 1909 he was graduated from\r\nMidland College. When he finished the common schools he studied in a\r\nGerman school for one year; so he both reads and writes German. He\r\ncompleted a double course at the Atchison Business College in five\r\nmonths, graduating in March, 1910, and a few days later he was appointed\r\ndeputy county clerk. When Mr. Voelker was eighteen years of age he took\r\npart in the Kansas intercollegiate oratorical contest, which was held at\r\nSalina. There were nineteen other contestants, several of them being men\r\ntwice the age of Voelker, who were going through college for the second\r\ntime. Voelker won fourth place in the contest, which in addition to\r\nbeing quite an honor, demonstrated that he has great ability as a public\r\nspeaker.\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt that he will be re-elected two years hence. He\r\nundoubtedly will prove to be one of the most efficient county clerks in\r\nthe history of the county.”\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph was prophetic, as Mr. Voelker’s second election to\r\nthe office in 1914 will testify. His re-election was the best evidence\r\nof his success and strong personal popularity. Mr. Voelker is affiliated\r\nwith several fraternal societies, an active party worker, what is known\r\nas a good mixer, and a rising young citizen of the county, whose future\r\ncareer will be well worth watching, inasmuch as he is bound to gain\r\ngreater honors in the years to come, and to climb to a still higher\r\nplace in the civic life of his home county and State.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SAMUEL S. KING.\r\n\r\nSamuel S. King, a member of the board of county commissioners of\r\nAtchison county, was born in Moorestown, N. J., May 16, 1856. One year\r\nlater, in 1857, he came to Atchison with his parents, John and Violet\r\nKing, on a boat owned by Dr. Challiss. The King family arrived at\r\nAtchison in April of 1857. John King soon afterward settled on a farm\r\nsix miles southwest of Atchison, where Samuel S. lived until he was\r\nfifteen years of age. He then came to Atchison for the purpose of\r\nattending the city schools. During vacations he worked for McPike &\r\nAllen (later McPike & Fox). After finishing his public school education\r\nMr. King was employed as bookkeeper for some time by White, Washer &\r\nKing, now the S. R. Washer Grain Company. He was also employed as\r\nbookkeeper by McPike & Fox, W. F. Dolan and others until 1881. In that\r\nyear he was appointed by Senator John J. Ingalls to a position in the\r\nUnited States railway mail service and was sent to New Mexico and\r\nArizona as railway mail agent. Here he remained in the United States\r\nGovernment service for about two years and then resigned to enter the\r\nemploy of P. B. Brannen & Company as bookkeeper and manager at\r\nFlagstaff, Ariz. This firm conducted a jobbing house at Flagstaff which\r\nwas then the largest town on the railroad between Albuquerque, N. M.,\r\nand Los Angeles, Cal. In June, 1886, he and his family returned to\r\nAtchison and Mr. King became the confidential bookkeeper of McPike &\r\nFox, wholesale druggists, and remained with this concern until the fall\r\nof 1897, when he resigned to take up his duties as county clerk.\r\n\r\nMr. King had always been more or less interested in politics and he was\r\nelected to the office of county clerk on the Republican ticket in the\r\nfall of 1897. He was subsequently reëlected and held the office for nine\r\nyears, or until January, 1907. He then engaged in the real estate and\r\ninsurance business which he still follows with offices at 106 North\r\nFifth street. Mr. King was elected mayor of the city of Atchison in\r\nApril, 1907, and served as the city executive for two years, and later\r\nwas appointed city clerk to fill out the unexpired term of C. A. Hawk,\r\nwho resigned. In the fall of 1914 he was elected county commissioner, an\r\noffice which he is at present filling in a capable and efficient manner.\r\n\r\nMr. King was married April 14, 1885, at Flagstaff, Ariz., to Miss Sarah\r\nHawks, of Newton, Kan. Two children have been born of this marriage,\r\nnamely, Grace and Victor. Mr. King is affiliated with the Ancient Free\r\nand Accepted Masons, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the\r\nFraternal Order of Eagles, of which lodge he is a trustee, the Modern\r\nWoodmen of America, the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the Mystic\r\nWorkers, and the Central Protective Association. There are few citizens\r\nwho are more highly esteemed, and Atchison county has not a more popular\r\npublic official than S. S. King.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHARLES T. GUNDY.\r\n\r\nThis history of Atchison county is issued not only for the purpose of\r\ninscribing a record of those who have built up the county and were here\r\nduring the pioneer days and endured the hardships of the pioneer life,\r\nbut for recording as well the life stories of those who came later and\r\nhave won places of merit and distinction in the affairs of the city and\r\ncounty of Atchison. It is probable that few men have attained such\r\neminence as Judge Charles T. Gundy of the city court of Atchison during\r\nhis brief residence here. The esteem in which he is held and the\r\nsuccessful manner in which he has performed the duties of his judicial\r\nposition are decided evidences of his ability. His standing among the\r\nmembers of the legal fraternity is high and he well merits the\r\nconfidence of his fellow citizens. The conduct of his court is marked\r\nfor the fairness of his decisions in suits of equity and the settlement\r\nof such cases as come under his jurisdiction have been accomplished to\r\nthe satisfaction of the parties concerned.\r\n\r\nJudge Charles T. Gundy is a native of Scotland county, Missouri, and he\r\nwas born and reared on his father’s farm, eight miles northwest of the\r\nthriving and progressive city of Memphis. He evinces much of the\r\ncharacteristics of the good people of Scotland county, who are noted for\r\ntheir hospitality and kindliness. He was born February 10, 1878, and is\r\na son of George M. and Margaret M. (Needham) Gundy, natives of Illinois\r\nand Missouri, respectively. George M. Gundy was born in 1845 and is a\r\nson of Jacob Gundy, a native of Holland, who settled in Scotland County,\r\nMissouri, as early as 1846. George M. still resides on the old home\r\nplace of the Gundy family. This farm consists of 160 acres of well\r\ntilled land on which have been reared six children out of a family of\r\nseven, as follows: Charles T., with whom this review is directly\r\nconcerned; Louis W. and Jacob R., farmers of Scotland county, Missouri;\r\nMrs. Corda Crawford, of Scotland county; Gladys, deceased; Pearl and\r\nMerl at home with their parents. The mother of these children is a\r\nnative of Scotland county, and was born in 1858, a daughter of David\r\nNeedham, a veteran of the Civil war and a scion of an old Kentucky\r\nfamily. He served three years as a soldier in the late rebellion, and\r\nafter returning home met an accidental death by a falling tree. The\r\nancestral home of the Needhams is near Frankfort, Ky. The Gundy family\r\nis held in high esteem in their home county and the members of the\r\nfamily are well respected by their friends and acquaintances.\r\n\r\nCharles T. Gundy was educated in the rural schools and attended the\r\nMemphis Academy for one year. Circumstances were such that he found it\r\nnecessary to do considerable studying at home and “burned the midnight\r\noil” in the pursuit of an education. He fitted himself for teaching and\r\ntaught for four years in the schools of his native county. In the\r\nmeantime he read law and was successful in being admitted to the bar in\r\n1902. For three years thereafter he practiced his profession in Memphis.\r\nHe then secured a Government position in the postoffice department at\r\nWashington, D. C., and pursued his law studies in the National\r\nUniversity at Washington. He graduated from that institution May 30,\r\n1908. Having small desire to become a mere cog in a great machine, as\r\nseemed to be the lot of thousands of Government employes, he resigned\r\nhis position in October of the same year and located in Keokuk, Iowa,\r\nand had charge of the farm loan department of the State Central Savings\r\nBank. He resigned this position in March of 1910 and came to Atchison,\r\nopening an office in the Auld building on Commercial street. Since this\r\ntime he has built up an excellent practice. He was appointed city judge\r\nin December of 1910 to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of Judge\r\nJ. P. Adams. He was elected to the office in 1912 and again elected in\r\n1914.\r\n\r\nJudge Gundy was united in marriage with Eleanor M. McCormick on August\r\n12, 1909. Mrs. Gundy was a resident of Washington, D. C., and is a\r\ndaughter of John McCormick, who died in 1905. Judge Gundy is a member of\r\nthe Baptist church and he and Mrs. Gundy have a wide circle of friends\r\nwho esteem them for their many likable qualities.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party has always claimed the allegiance of Judge Gundy\r\nand he takes an active and influential interest in political affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LOUIS R. KUEHNHOFF.\r\n\r\nLouis R. Kuehnhoff, farmer and stockman, of Lancaster township, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, was born January 1, 1880, on the farm where he now\r\nresides. He is a son of Charles and Caroline Kuehnhoff, and is one of\r\nnine children, six of whom are living. The father was born in Germany in\r\n1841, and left there when a boy of sixteen years and sailed for New\r\nYork. He remained there a short time when he went west, arriving at St.\r\nJoseph, Mo. He had not been there very long when the Civil war broke out\r\nand he enlisted at St. Joseph in Company B of the Volunteer infantry.\r\nAfter the war was over he was mustered out at Lexington, Mo., having won\r\na praiseworthy military record in his country’s service. He then\r\nreturned to civil life in St. Joseph, Mo., where he worked for a time as\r\na laborer, receiving eight dollars a month. Shortly afterward he came to\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, and bought eighty acres of land in section 10,\r\nLancaster township. Using oxen, he broke the ground on his newly\r\nacquired farm and began to improve it as rapidly as his resources would\r\npermit. In 1894 he retired and went to live at the National Soldiers’\r\nHome at Leavenworth, Kan., where he died in 1903. The mother was born in\r\nGermany in 1845, and died in 1899.\r\n\r\nLouis R. Kuehnhoff grew up on his father’s farm, and attended Eden\r\ndistrict school, and also District No. 3, Lancaster township. He\r\nremained at home until he was nineteen years of age, and the next five\r\nyears worked as a farm hand, and then he bought the old home place of\r\n200 acres. Louis Kuehnhoff is an industrious worker. He keeps graded\r\nstock of all kinds and takes a special interest in fine mules. He always\r\nattends the county fairs in Atchison county and occasionally makes\r\nentries. On April 26, 1905, he was married to Lena Werner, who was born\r\nin Germany November 2, 1881. Her parents were John and Marie (Earhart)\r\nWerner. The father was born in Germany in 1815. He belonged to the\r\nMasonic lodge in Germany. In 1889, when he was quite an old man, he came\r\nto America and settled at Leavenworth, where he died in 1891. The mother\r\nwas born in Germany January 17, 1843, and is now living with her\r\nchildren, of whom there are six, as follows: Adam, teamster,\r\nLeavenworth, Kan.; Martha Nolan, deceased; Lizzie Loman, Bowling, Kan.;\r\nKatherine Weimer, Wallula, Wyandotte county, Kansas; Lena, wife of Mr.\r\nKuehnhoff, of this review. Mrs. Kuehnhoff attended the Pleasant Ridge\r\nschool and the German school, north of Potter, Kan. She is a good,\r\nloyal, hard-working mother, and has three children: Marie, Edna and\r\nEdwin. The last two are twins and are three years old. In politics Mr.\r\nKuehnhoff is independent. He is a member of the Independent Order of Odd\r\nFellows. He is a progressive farmer and is constantly on the lookout for\r\nimprovements in agricultural methods. He has a fine eight-room house and\r\na large barn equipped with modern conveniences. He also has a stone\r\nmilk-house which was built by his father years ago. He has a small but\r\nthriving orchard and has twelve head of fine cattle. Besides these, he\r\nhas four horses and a span of excellent mules. Mr. Kuehnhoff takes a\r\nlively interest in his stock and in his farm generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BENJAMIN FRANKLIN SANDERS.\r\n\r\nAll honor to the pioneer settlers of Kansas. It was they who broke the\r\nway in the unpeopled wilderness and endured the hardships and privations\r\non the frontier of advancing civilization in order that the path of\r\nempire might be pushed steadily westward, ever onward toward the setting\r\nsun. Their work is done; the halcyon pioneer days when this broad land\r\nwas but a vast unbroken wilderness of waving prairie grass, dotted here\r\nand there with belts of timber along the streams, is no more; towns and\r\ncities have sprung up; the locomotive shrieks its way over the ribbon-\r\nlike rails, hauling the products of the land to the millions in need of\r\nsustenance, where once the hardy freighters drove their mule teams and\r\nguarded the precious freight overland to the homes of the settlers in\r\nthe West. Benjamin Franklin Sanders is one of the few remaining members\r\nof the “old guard,” who sixty years ago began the task of reclaiming a\r\nwilderness. He is one of the ranking old pioneer settlers of Atchison\r\ncounty and has lived a record which is thrilling and interesting to a\r\nhigh degree. He is the only living “ye old time fiddler” in Atchison\r\ncounty, who with his comrade was wont to play at the old-time dances and\r\n“hoe downs” in northeast Kansas fifty years and more ago.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin Sanders is now living retired in Center township,\r\nAtchison county. He was born August 8, 1833, in Franklin county,\r\nMissouri, and is a son of George and Elizabeth (Graham) Sanders, who\r\nwere the parents of the following children: Nancy married William\r\nMcQuillan, and by her second marriage became Mrs. William Burns, and\r\ndied in Benton county, Missouri; Robert, deceased; Oliver died in Jewell\r\ncounty, Kansas; Lydia married Fred Wilming, and died in Shannon\r\ntownship, Atchison county; William died in Franklin county, Missouri;\r\nand Benjamin, the subject of this sketch. Benjamin F. Sanders was sent\r\nto the country school in Franklin county, Missouri, but the school was\r\npoor and the roads were bad in the winter time, and, altogether, he had\r\nlittle opportunity to learn. His whole time in school, he estimates, did\r\nnot amount to more than three months. His father was a Kentuckian and\r\nfollowed farming all of his life, and died in 1856, at the age of fifty-\r\nfive years. The mother was a native of Missouri and of Scotch descent.\r\nShe died in Kansas, in 1872, at the age of seventy-six years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _B. F. Sanders_\r\n\r\n  B. F. Sanders and His Great-Granddaughter, Gail Maxine Keirns,\r\n    Daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Art Keirns.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt the age of twelve Benjamin F. Sanders was apprenticed to a carriage\r\nand wagon-maker in St. Louis, Mo. He remained there twelve years, coming\r\nto Kansas in 1856. He returned to Missouri for a short time and then\r\ncame back to Kansas the following year. He opened a wagon-maker’s shop\r\nat Monrovia, Atchison county, which he operated for two years. He then\r\nengaged in farming, taking up a claim near where Effingham now stands.\r\nThis was ten miles from any settlement then and Mr. Sanders, fearing\r\nthat the district would not be settled, gave up his claim and preëmpted\r\neighty acres one and one-half miles north of where he now lives, in\r\nCenter township, and began his life as a real farmer. He hired a man\r\nfrom Iowa who had six yoke of oxen to break up his land. He lived in the\r\nmost primitive way during the first years on this place. Coffee, for one\r\nthing, was very high in price at that time, and there also was very\r\nlittle money in the territory, so a substitute for coffee was used. They\r\nmixed wheat and rye, calling it essence of coffee, and used this as a\r\nbeverage in place of the regular coffee. It was the same way with flour.\r\nWhen he needed flour he would take a quantity of wheat to the gristmill\r\nwhere it would be ground into coarse flour, nearest mills being at\r\nValley Falls and Kickapoo. His nearest postoffice was at Oceana, just\r\nnorth of Pardee, where the postoffice was located later. In 1860 Mr.\r\nSanders bought more land. At one time he owned as high as 400 acres of\r\nland in Center township, Atchison county, Kansas. He went through the\r\nwhole evolution of civilization, beginning in a little log house on his\r\nfirst eighty acres of land and passed through the wild days of the\r\nborder war. In 1863 he was a member of Captain Whittaker’s company of\r\nColonel McQuigg’s regiment of the Kansas State militia. He participated\r\nin several skirmishes and was honorably discharged at Ft. Leavenworth in\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Mr. Sanders married Margaret Ramsey in Putnam county, Ohio, who\r\nwas born in 1840. She was a daughter of John and Elizabeth (Dorothy)\r\nRamsey, natives of Ohio. She died in 1868, leaving the following\r\nchildren: Ira, farmer, Whiting, Kan.; Bertha (Mrs. C. G. Moore),\r\ndeceased; William and Little Joy, both deceased. Mr. Sanders was married\r\na second time in 1870 to Mrs. Elizabeth (Ramsey) Keirns, a sister of his\r\nfirst wife. She died in May, 1904. She was the widow of Rufus Keirns,\r\nand by her last marriage three children were born: Henry R., farmer,\r\nPardee, Kan.; Mrs. Etta C. Browne, Pardee, Kan.; Benjamin, Jr., died\r\nwhen seventeen years of age.\r\n\r\nMr. Sanders is a Republican and a member of the Methodist Episcopal\r\nchurch. He is now living with Arthur Keirns, a son of his step-son. In\r\nthese days his life is rather quiet compared with the early-day\r\nexistence which he passed through. Indians camped near his farm when he\r\nfirst came to Kansas. The trail to the Kickapoo reservation passed near\r\nhis farm and the Indians were constantly traveling back and forth along\r\nit. He has a hobby of “fiddling.” He calls himself a “fiddler” in\r\ndistinction from a violinist. He played at the first corn carnival held\r\nin Atchison and won a prize. He used to play with Samuel King, a well\r\nknown “fiddler,” and they played for all the old “hoe down” or “break\r\ndown” dances. Although he is eighty-three years old, he still plays his\r\n“fiddle” with as much vim as ever and his ear is just as ready as it was\r\nwhen he was a young man. In addition to being a farmer, Mr. Sanders has\r\ndone a large amount of carpenter work in Kansas. He has built a number\r\nof barns and other buildings. Mr. Sanders was elected to the office of\r\ntownship trustee and held the office two terms, having been reëlected at\r\nthe close of his first term.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          KARL AUGUST KAMMER.\r\n\r\nKarl August Kammer, farmer and stockman, Lancaster township, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, was born on the farm where he now lives, October 12,\r\n1869, and is a son of Karl and Joehanna (Hida) Kammer. He is one of six\r\nchildren: Joehanna (Gutzman), deceased; Emma (Fuhrman), Lancaster\r\ntownship; Karl, subject of this sketch; Julius, Lancaster township;\r\nBertha H. (Buttron), Lancaster township; one child who died in infancy.\r\nThe father was born in Germany in 1840. Leaving there in 1862, he came\r\nto Atchison county, Kansas, where he worked in a vineyard for two years.\r\nThe following four years he was employed in a brewery at Atchison, and\r\nthen farmed two years in Lancaster township. At that time he had a\r\nchance to buy 160 acres in section 16 of Lancaster township, and with\r\nthe aid of a partner, the land was bought. He built a one-room shanty\r\nand a thatched barn, and broke prairie with the oxen and planted the\r\nfirst crop. Later a better house and barn were built, and gradually,\r\nother improvements were added and a fine orchard planted. At the time of\r\nhis death, in October, 1910, Mr. Kammer owned 240 acres of land. The\r\nmother was born in Germany, February 20, 1840, and married in her native\r\nland just before coming to America. She died in 1904.\r\n\r\nKarl Kammer, the subject of this sketch, was reared on his father’s farm\r\nin Lancaster township. He attended High Prairie district school, No. 3,\r\nand remained on the home farm until he was twenty-six years old, when he\r\nrented some land from his father, and six years later he was able to buy\r\nthe land he had been renting. He improved the farm considerably and\r\nstocked it with graded cattle, and now has an excellent farm, modern in\r\nevery respect, consisting of 160 acres of land, and also has a fine\r\norchard of two acres.\r\n\r\nMr. Kammer was married October 23, 1895, to Emma Buttron, a native of\r\nLancaster township, Atchison county, born August 14, 1870. She is a\r\ndaughter of Henry and Rosa (Scheu) Buttron, the father a native of\r\nGermany, born in 1833. When a young man he left his native land and came\r\nto America, locating in Pennsylvania where he worked as a blacksmith.\r\nFrom there he went to Elgin, Ill., and continued at his trade, and in\r\n1857, he moved to Atchison, Kan., following blacksmithing for a short\r\ntime. He then preëmpted 160 acres of land in Lancaster township, where\r\nhe built a house. The first crop was destroyed by grasshoppers, and he\r\nwas forced to return to his trade during the following winter. When\r\nspring came, he went back to his farm and that year was successful and\r\nhis start was assured. Mr. Buttron bought more land and continued to\r\nmake improvements, and after a long and prosperous career he died in\r\n1914. Mr. and Mrs. Kammer are the parents of three children: Katherine,\r\nRosa and Henrietta, all living at home with their parents. Mr. Kammer is\r\na Republican, and is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Kammer and family are members of the Evangelical Lutheran\r\nchurch of High Prairie neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MARSHALL J. CLOYES.\r\n\r\nThe demise of Marshall J. Cloyes May 5, 1915, marked the passing of one\r\nof the sturdy figures who assisted in developing Atchison county, and\r\nwas one of the grand old men of the city. At the time of his death he\r\nwas probably the oldest living pioneer settler of Atchison county, in\r\npoint of age and years of residence in the county. For over half a\r\ncentury he had been one of the well known and distinguished characters\r\nwhom people trusted and respected. In the days when strong men were\r\nrequired to redeem a wilderness and make it habitable for men and their\r\nprogeny, Marshall Cloyes was one of those who never gave up the fight.\r\nDuring the terrible drought of 1860, when scores of families deserted\r\ntheir homes and left the State, he and his family were among those who\r\ndecided to remain and win out over the vagaries of nature. His faith in\r\nthe future of Kansas was amply justified as the years rolled on and ever\r\nincreasing prosperity came to him and his, as a just and equitable\r\nreward for a faith and confidence bestowed upon the new country during a\r\ntime which tried men’s souls and caused weaker mortals to give up the\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nHe was born at Salisbury, Vt., October 24, 1826, and descended from\r\nsturdy New England ancestry. His parents were Elijah and Mary (Beach)\r\nCloyes. On his father’s side his ancestry can be traced back in the\r\ncenturies to two brothers who settled in New England in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. His grandfather was William Cloyes, who fought for his country\r\nin the War of 1812. The boyhood days of Marshall were spent in the town\r\nof Salisbury, where he attended the public schools and later pursued his\r\neducation in a private school. He learned the trade of shoemaker but did\r\nnot follow it to any great extent. In 1847 he engaged in the lumber\r\nbusiness at Ripton, Vt., and was there for twelve years prior to coming\r\nto Kansas. From the town in which he was born he came to Kansas,\r\narriving here in Atchison June 2, 1859. The following autumn his wife\r\nand sons followed him and during the ensuing winter the family lived in\r\na two room hut, on the rear of the lots where Mrs. Jacob Leu’s residence\r\nnow stands. On February 21, 1860, they loaded all their goods in a\r\nwagon, and with an ox team moved to a farm north of Lancaster. During\r\nthe night an old-time Kansas blizzard gave them a cold reception in\r\ntheir new home. When Mr. Cloyes had agreed to pay $650 for his first\r\nquarter section of land he was still shy $2.50 of the necessary amount,\r\nand was forced to borrow this small sum from a kind neighbor. During the\r\nfollowing summer he worked in Oliver Davis’ sawmill and got enough\r\nlumber to build a shanty on his farm. While this was building the family\r\nlived in two rooms in the home of John S. Rust. In the fall of the bad\r\nyear of 1860, Mr. Cloyes decided to try to cash in on the reputation he\r\nhad left behind him in Vermont, and applied to an uncle for a loan of\r\n$400. The uncle readily responded with the statement in his letter, “If\r\nyou are ever able, I know you will pay it back; if you are never able to\r\npay it back I can get along without it.” During the summer Mr. Cloyes\r\nput in his spare time cutting prairie hay and stacking it. When fall and\r\nwinter came on, the returning freighters from Pike’s Peak were willing\r\nto sell their oxen and wagons for almost any price. Mr. Cloyes invested\r\na part of his $400 capital in these outfits, wintered the cattle on the\r\nhay, and in the spring was able to dispose of the oxen for more than\r\ndouble the purchase prices. During the next two years he was enabled to\r\npay off all of his debts, and prosperity attended his efforts from that\r\ntime on. By the hard work and good management of himself and his two\r\nsons he increased his holdings to an entire section of land. He remained\r\non the farm until 1872, then gave the farm to his sons and removed to a\r\nhome at 417 North Seventh street in Atchison.\r\n\r\nOn July 5, 1848, Mr. Cloyes was married to Miss Betsy Henderson, of\r\nMiddlebury, Vt., who died in Atchison in 1893, leaving two sons, Frank\r\nE. and Mark S. On September 15, 1909, he took a second wife, the bride\r\nbeing this time Mrs. Matilda Franke, of Atchison. She was born at\r\nThuringen, Germany, November 16, 1855, a daughter of John and Christiana\r\n(Temme) Franke, who immigrated to America in 1858, making the long sea\r\nvoyage in a sailing vessel which took six long weeks to make a trip,\r\nwhich is now made in six days. From New York City the Frankes came\r\ndirectly to St. Louis, and there made their home until their removal to\r\nAtchison. At the outbreak of the Civil war, John Franke volunteered his\r\nservices in defense of the Union which had given him a home. He served\r\nin a Missouri regiment of volunteers for one year, and was then\r\ndischarged on account of serious disability, caused by the hardships\r\nwhich he had undergone. He was never the same man afterwards, and died\r\nin 1865 as a direct result of his disabilities incurred in behalf of his\r\nadopted country. The mother and family lived in St. Louis until 1883\r\nwhen they removed to Atchison. Mrs. Franke died some years later at the\r\nhome of her daughter, Mrs. Cloyes. Matilda Franke was first married to\r\nTheo A. Franke, a native of Saxony, Germany, in 1879, and who came to\r\nAmerica when a youth of eighteen years of age, and settled in\r\nPittsburgh, Penn. Theo A. Franke was also a veteran of the Civil war,\r\nhaving enlisted in 1861 in Company D, Seventy-fourth regiment,\r\nPennsylvania infantry. He served throughout the great conflict and was\r\nwounded several times while participating in the battles fought by the\r\nArmy of the Potomac. He enlisted again, after being discharged on\r\naccount of a serious wound, and was a brave and valiant soldier who\r\nfought for sheer love of his adopted country. Mr. Franke’s first trip to\r\nAtchison was made in 1859, but he returned to Pittsburg upon the\r\noutbreak of the Civil war and there proffered his services as stated\r\nabove. He returned to Atchison after the close of the war and here met,\r\nin the course of years, Matilda, who was visiting friends in Atchison.\r\nTheir acquaintance ripened into a warm friendship which gave place to\r\nlove and they were married March 10, 1879. A happy wedded life endured\r\nuntil Mr. Franke’s death in 1882. Children blessed this union as\r\nfollows: Rose M., wife of Bert Gilmore, an electrician of Atchison;\r\nElsa, wife of Fred Moore, a railway engineer of Falls City, Neb.; Theo\r\nFranke, of Pierce, Ariz. During Mr. Franke’s first year of residence in\r\nAtchison he was a freighter across the plains. Upon his return in 1865\r\nhe entered the grocery business and prospered, accumulating considerable\r\nproperty interests. He was well known in Atchison and was considered to\r\nbe one of the city’s most substantial men.\r\n\r\nMr. Cloyes was prominently identified with the political affairs of the\r\ncounty and was an influential leader of the Republican party for many\r\nyears. Even before coming to Atchison from the farm he had taken an\r\nactive interest in politics in his home township and county. He was\r\nelected to represent his district in the State legislature in 1867,\r\nleaving the impress of his individuality upon laws passed in the\r\nfollowing session. For eight years he served in the Atchison city\r\ncouncil and in 1891 was elected mayor. Two years later he was reëlected.\r\nHonorable and thoroughly upright in all his dealings, his\r\nadministrations were characterized by integrity, sound judgment and an\r\nunusual amount of good sense. He was a member of Washington Lodge, No.\r\n5, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, and all who knew him respected him\r\nfor his sterling worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MARK D. SNYDER.\r\n\r\nMark D. Snyder, retired farmer, living in Monrovia, Atchison county,\r\nKansas, is a native son of Kansas, having been born in Atchison county\r\nNovember 2, 1858. He is a son of Hon. Solomon J. H. Snyder, one of the\r\ninfluential figures of the early pioneer days of Kansas, and who was a\r\nstanch and uncompromising adherent of the Free State principles. The\r\nfather of Mark D. was born in Washington county, Maryland, February 7,\r\n1812, and died at Monrovia, Atchison county, November 28, 1873. When\r\neight years of age he accompanied his father to Tuscarawas county, Ohio,\r\nwhere he was educated in the district schools and a graded school at\r\nCanton, Ohio. Between 1830 and 1833 he cleared a farm of 160 acres of\r\nheavily timbered land. In 1838 he married Susan Winklepleck and then\r\ncleared and cultivated a tract of timber land which he purchased until\r\n1848. His wife died in that year, leaving him with three small children.\r\nHe sold all of his holdings, placed his children with neighborhood\r\nfamilies and then traveled 4,000 miles in an endeavor to forget his\r\ngreat loss and overcome his grief over the death of his wife. Later, he\r\nmarried Eliza Fisher, and in 1852 removed to Indiana, and then came west\r\nto Ft. Leavenworth in 1854. On the morning of May 4, 1854, he made the\r\nfirst legal homestead claim ever entered in the State of Kansas,\r\ncomprising the land upon which the southern part of the city of\r\nLeavenworth now stands, and then returned to Indiana for his family. On\r\nhis return to his homestead he found his claim “jumped” and the country\r\nin the hands of border ruffians. He was driven from the polls at the\r\nfirst election held in the Territory on account of his Free Soil\r\nprinciples. Two other claims which he bought were wrested from him by a\r\npro-slavery “squatter court,” his life threatened, and he sought refuge\r\nin an unsettled part of the State where Monrovia now stands. Here he\r\nmade his home and became prominently identified with the politics of the\r\nnew State of Kansas. In 1862 Mr. Snyder was elected to the State\r\nlegislature and served for two terms in the house of representatives,\r\nand one in the senate, where he did faithful and conscientious work in\r\nbehalf of the people of Kansas.\r\n\r\nSolomon J. H. Snyder was a devoted Christian, and was one of the\r\norganizers of the first Lutheran church organization in the State, at\r\nMonrovia, of which he remained a member until his demise. He was a great\r\nSunday school worker and wrote two very interesting and valuable Sunday\r\nschool books, “The Lost Children” and “Scenes in the Far West,” and at\r\nthe time of his death was engaged in the preparation of a work entitled,\r\n“The Evidences of Christianity.” His influence was ever in behalf of the\r\nbetterment of mankind and his Christianity was of the practical kind\r\nwhich introduces helpfulness, kindness and forbearance into our daily\r\nlives. The children of S. J. H. and Eliza (Fisher) Snyder were as\r\nfollows: Angeline (Conley), deceased; Mrs. Sarah Dunn, of Anadarko,\r\nOkla.; Mrs. Cora Shifflet, deceased; and Mark D. The three children by\r\nhis first wife were: Mrs. Susan Reck, deceased; Mrs. Anna Berndt, of\r\nMexico City; and J. H., San Diego, Cal. The mother of these children was\r\nborn in Ohio in 1838, and died at her home near Monrovia, in 1896.\r\n\r\nMark D. Snyder, with whom this review is directly concerned, was born,\r\nreared, and reared his own family in Atchison county. He is one of the\r\nreal native born citizens of the county. Upon the death of his father he\r\ntook charge of the old home place, and when his mother died he purchased\r\nthe family estate. By the exercise of industry and economy, aided by\r\ngood financial judgment, he has become the owner of 240 acres of\r\nexcellent land which is well improved and one of the most productive\r\ntracts of land in northeast Kansas. He cultivated his broad acres\r\nassiduously until 1909, when he turned over the management of his farm\r\nto his son, and retired to Monrovia, where he now resides.\r\n\r\nMr. Snyder was married November 30, 1881, to Helen M. Maxfield, and this\r\nunion has been blessed with eight children, namely: Elsie and Minnie,\r\ndeceased; John, who is farming the home place; Mark, living in Omaha,\r\nNeb.; Mildred, deceased; Margaret and Marguerette, twins, deceased;\r\nJames, a boy twelve years old, living with John on the home farm. The\r\nmother of these children was born in Henry county, Illinois, a daughter\r\nof David and Anna (Freeze) Maxfield, who first emigrated from Illinois\r\nto Sedgwick county, Kansas, and in 1873 came to Atchison county. Mrs.\r\nSnyder died in 1909. Mr. Snyder has always been a loyal supporter of the\r\nRepublican party, is an attendant of the Lutheran church, and is a\r\nmember of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, of Effingham, Kan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             EDWARD PERDUE.\r\n\r\nEdward Perdue, president of the First National Bank of Atchison, and\r\nextensive farmer, of Huron, Kan., has been a resident of Atchison county\r\nfor the past forty-five years. Like other successful men who were\r\npioneers in Kansas, he arrived here from Canada when a young man of\r\ntwenty years of age without money, but possessed of strength, a\r\nwillingness to work at honest labor and an ambition to succeed. How well\r\nhe has succeeded is seen in the substantial fortune which he has\r\naccumulated and the honors which have been conferred upon him by his\r\nfellow citizens.\r\n\r\nMr. Perdue was born on a farm in Peterboro county, Ontario, Canada, June\r\n27, 1850, a son of Thomas and Catharine Perdue, natives of Ireland, who\r\nleft the Emerald Isle in their youth and settled in Canada. Edward\r\nPerdue was reared to sturdy young manhood on the parental farm and\r\nattended the country school in the vicinity of his home as opportunity\r\nafforded. In March of 1870 he arrived in Atchison, and during his first\r\nyear worked at any odd jobs which were presented, including labor on the\r\nstreets and harvesting on the nearby farms. During the following five\r\nyears he was employed as a construction foreman on the grading and\r\nbuilding of the Santa Fe railroad from Atchison to the Colorado-Kansas\r\nState line. He saved his money and by the exercise of strict economy,\r\nwhich meant the denial to himself of all but the actual necessities of\r\nlife, he was enabled to accumulate sufficient funds to invest in a farm\r\nnear the town of Huron, on which he resided for the next five years. He\r\nthen sold this farm and bought another one about one and one-half miles\r\neast from Huron, which remains his home to the present time. Mr. Perdue\r\nhas given his attention mostly to the raising and feeding of live stock\r\nin his farming operations and has succeeded in amassing a comfortable\r\nfortune during the forty years he has been an agriculturist. He has\r\nincreased his land holdings until at the present time he is the owner of\r\n1,040 acres of splendid farm lands in Lancaster township. His home farm\r\nis one of the best improved tracts of farm land in the county and all of\r\nhis farms show the results obtained from soil conservation and advanced\r\nmethods of farming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Edward Perdue_\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Perdue has been primarily a farmer, he has given his attention\r\nto other matters as betokens a man of influence and substance. In the\r\nyear 1891 he assisted in the organization of the Huron State Bank and is\r\npresident of this thriving concern. In 1906 he took part in the\r\norganization of the Commercial State Bank of Atchison, which was\r\nsucceeded later by the First National Bank, of which banking institution\r\nhe has served as president since 1900. He is also a stockholder of the\r\nState Savings Bank of Leavenworth, Kansas.\r\n\r\nMr. Perdue was married in 1878 to Mary Viola Davey, of Brown county,\r\nKansas, a daughter of Charles Davey, which marriage has resulted in the\r\nbirth of seven children, as follows: Mrs. Maria Walters, living on a\r\nfarm near Huron; Edna, wife of J. M. Delaney, merchant, of Huron, Kan.;\r\nMrs. Mabel Schmidt, wife of the assistant cashier of the Huron State\r\nBank; Charles, who is cultivating the home farm; Thomas Hendricks, at\r\nhome; George, a farmer in North Dakota; and Edward, Jr.\r\n\r\nMr. Perdue has been a life-long Democrat, who has always taken a more or\r\nless active part in the political affairs of the county. He was elected\r\ncounty commissioner in 1897 and served one term. In 1904 he served one\r\nterm as a member of the State legislature, representing this district,\r\ndeclining reëlection when his term of office expired. While he was\r\nreared in the Catholic belief, Mr. Perdue is tolerant of all creeds and\r\ntakes a broad-minded view of religious matters. He belongs to the\r\nAncient Order of United Workmen and the Modern Woodmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DR. CHARLES L. HIXON.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles L. Hixon, a leading dental practitioner of Atchison is a\r\nnative son of Kansas and comes of a pioneer family of the State. He was\r\nborn on a farm in Jackson county, Kansas, January 14, 1872, and is a son\r\nof John S. and Alice (Clark) Hixon. His father, John S. Hixon, was born\r\nin Ohio in 1850, a son of Jacob and Cassandra (Stonebraker) Hixon, who\r\nresided in Ashland county, Ohio, until their removal to Putnam county,\r\nIndiana, in the early pioneer days when that part of the Hoosier State\r\nwas being settled by large numbers of Ohio people. Alice Clark Hixon,\r\nmother of Dr. Hixon, was likewise born in 1850 in Putnam county,\r\nIndiana, a daughter of Andrew Jackson and Harriet (Mann) Clark, natives\r\nof New York State, and also pioneer settlers of Putnam county, Indiana.\r\nWhile John S. Hixon and Alice Clark were attending the district school\r\nin the neighborhood of their respective homes, they became great\r\nfriends, and the warm friendship ripening into love which culminated in\r\ntheir marriage several years later in Jackson county, Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe Hixons and Clarks were essentially pioneers, and the history of the\r\nfamily for generations shows that some member of the family, or several\r\nof them, have been continually pushing westward and settling in the\r\nnewer countries. Jacob Hixon was one of the first men in his\r\nneighborhood to hearken to the call of the West, and, after disposing of\r\nhis land holdings in Putnam county, Indiana, he with all of his family\r\nmigrated to Kansas, settling in Jackson county. They arrived in Atchison\r\nduring the stormy days of the Civil war, and at a time when the local\r\nvigilance committee was in control of community affairs and were\r\nnaturally very suspicious of all strangers. There had been considerable\r\nlawlessness in Atchison and neighboring towns and many outrages had been\r\nperpetrated by border ruffians and outlaws. The vigilance committee had\r\ntaken charge of the affairs and had summarily lynched three men on the\r\nbanks of White Clay creek just previous to the arrival of the Hixon\r\nfamily. Mr. Hixon was interrogated as to his loyalty to the Union and\r\nasked his intentions. His replies being satisfactory to the members of\r\nthe committee, he was allowed to proceed on his way to Jackson county\r\nand arrived at Holton, Kansas, without further delay. Jacob Hixon\r\nsettled on a fine farm near Holton, developed it and prospered as the\r\nyears rolled on and the country became more and more settled. He died in\r\n1905, at the advanced age of eighty-four years, his wife, Cassandra,\r\ndeparting this life in 1885.\r\n\r\nThe Clark family came to Kansas from Indiana in 1868, and Andrew Jackson\r\nClark naturally settled in that part of Jackson county where his old\r\nfriend and neighbor had chosen his place of residence. The intimacy\r\nwhich had existed between the two families in Putnam county, Indiana,\r\nwas renewed, and as time went on, John S. Hixon and Alice Clark grew to\r\nmaturity and were united in marriage. Their married life has been a\r\nhappy and prosperous one, and five children have blessed this union: Dr.\r\nCharles L. Hixon, with whom this review is directly concerned; Mrs. J.\r\nC. Neeley, of Weiser, Idaho; Ernest H. Hixon, of Kansas City, Mo.; one\r\nchild died in infancy. John S. Hixon became prominently identified with\r\nthe civic life of Jackson county and is serving his county well and\r\nfaithfully as treasurer for two terms, having been elected on the\r\nRepublican ticket in 1912 and again in 1914. Mr. and Mrs. John S. Hixon\r\nreside in Holton, in Jackson county, and are prosperous and well\r\nrespected in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nDr. C. L. Hixon spent his boyhood days on the farm and early learned to\r\nassist in the farm work. He received his elementary education in the\r\ndistrict schools, and was ambitious to secure a higher education. He has\r\npractically educated himself, and after learning all that was possible\r\nfor him to learn in the country school, he attended Campbell College, at\r\nHolton, Kan., for two years. His ambition was to become a dentist, and\r\nwith this end in view he matriculated in the University of Iowa in 1895.\r\nAfter spending two profitable years in this institution in the study of\r\ndentistry he returned home, and a short time later opened an office in\r\nAtchison, where he has practiced continuously for the past eighteen\r\nyears. After seven years of practice in his first location, he opened\r\nwell equipped offices at 519 Commercial street, and remained there until\r\nhis removal to his present location at 613 Commercial street, where he\r\nhas offices equipped with all the latest appliances for facilitating his\r\nwork. Dr. Hixon is kept very busy attending to the calls made upon him\r\nin the practice of his profession, and during the many years he has been\r\nlocated in Atchison, he has built up an extensive and lucrative\r\npractice. He finds time, however, to keep abreast of the latest\r\ndevelopments made in his profession, and is ever seeking to better his\r\nskill and knowledge of dentistry. He has been distinctly honored by the\r\nmembers of his profession, having served as president of the Northeast\r\nKansas Dental Association, and is at present an active member of this\r\nassociation. He is a leading member of the Atchison Dental Association,\r\nand ranks high in his profession, not only as a successful practitioner,\r\nbut as a citizen who has the best interests of his home city at heart.\r\nHe is a member of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, Washington\r\nLodge, No. 5, and is fraternally affiliated with the Odd Fellows, the\r\nModern Woodmen of America, the Rebekah and Eastern Star lodges.\r\n\r\nDr. Hixon was united in marriage with Miss Inez B. Horn in 1902, and one\r\nchild has been born to this union, Charles Horn Hixon, born May 25,\r\n1907. Mrs. Inez B. Hixon was born in Atchison county, a daughter of J.\r\nH. and Catharine (Wallick) Horn, who reside at 1126 North Third street,\r\nAtchison. Mrs. Horn is a daughter of Benjamin Wallick, who served as\r\nsheriff of the county during the time of the Civil war.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LOUIS KLOEPPER.\r\n\r\nLouis Kloepper, farmer and stockman of Lancaster township, Atchison\r\ncounty, was born January 18, 1888, on the farm where he now lives. He is\r\na son of William and Fredericka (Von Derahe) Kloepper, who were the\r\nparents of four children as follows: Louis, subject of this sketch;\r\nEmma, deceased; William, deceased; Pauline, living at home. The father\r\nwas born in Germany, December 14, 1853. He left there in 1883 and came\r\ndirectly to Atchison county, Kansas, where he bought eighty acres of\r\nland in section 27, Lancaster township. He farmed this one year, and in\r\n1885 returned to Germany to be married. In 1886 he returned to his farm\r\nand began to improve it, building a large eight-room house in 1899 in\r\nplace of the little three-room affair which stood on the place. In 1903\r\nhe built a fine 32×40 feet granary, and in 1904 he erected a large barn,\r\n40×48 feet. The following year he bought more land and put up additional\r\nbuildings, building in 1908 another barn, 32×40 feet. At the time of his\r\ndeath, February 7, 1913, he owned 240 acres of well improved land under\r\ncultivation, and thirteen acres of fine timber land. This achievement is\r\nthe more remarkable in view of the fact that he landed with only $1,200.\r\nBut he was industrious, and worked faithfully to improve his farm. He\r\nwas a member, trustee and steward of the German Lutheran church. His\r\nwife was born in Germany, February 15, 1858, and is a daughter of Henry\r\nand Fredericka (Von Behren) Von Derahe, natives of Germany. The mother\r\nis now living with her son, Louis.\r\n\r\nLouis Kloepper attended the old Huron school of Lancaster township, and\r\ngrew to manhood on the farm which he now operates. Since the death of\r\nhis father he has had charge of the farm and has worked to the extent of\r\nhis ability in installing modern improvements on his place. He owns 160\r\nacres in section 27, Lancaster township, in addition to the home place,\r\nand has three acres of orchard and grove. He also has a vineyard which\r\nwas the feature of the place which Louis, and his father before him,\r\nalways loved most. Special attention has been given to the vineyard when\r\nother things had to be neglected, perhaps. It is the pride of Mr.\r\nKloepper’s place. He keeps graded stock and is a practical farmer. He\r\nnow is operating 400 acres of land, 114 acres of which are in corn, and\r\nninety-three acres are in cloves, the latter having been unusually\r\nsuccessful. He owns a threshing outfit and two clover hullers, a corn\r\nshredder, and three gas engines. He utilizes these engines in numerous\r\nways, including pumping and threshing and plowing. Mr. Kloepper has a\r\nmodern farm in every way and has all up-to-date improvements of a labor\r\nand time saving kind, as well as an automobile. He is a stockholder in\r\nthe Farmers’ Mercantile Association of Effingham, Kan. He is a practical\r\nfarmer, of the progressive type.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 he married Marie Meier, a native of Germany, born July 3, 1888.\r\nShe is a daughter of Henry and Fredericka (Finke) Meier, and was\r\neducated in Germany and left her native land at the age of seventeen.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Kloepper have two children, Fredia, born November 13, 1911,\r\nand Emma, born April 21, 1913. Mr. Kloepper is an independent voter. He\r\nbelongs to the German Lutheran church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHARLES W. FERGUSON.\r\n\r\nCharles W. Ferguson, vice-president of the Atchison Savings Bank, is one\r\nof the best known men in financial circles of northeastern Kansas, and\r\nhe is equally as well known over a large section of western Missouri.\r\nMr. Ferguson was born at Plattsburg, Mo., December 29, 1862, and is a\r\nson of William L. and Fannie A. (Carpenter) Ferguson, both natives of\r\nKentucky, whose parents were Virginians and very early settlers of the\r\nBlue Grass State. The Ferguson family removed from Kentucky to Missouri\r\nabout 1851. They came up the Missouri river by boat as far as Liberty\r\nLanding, and later located in Clinton county, Missouri. The father was a\r\nmerchant and also engaged in the grain business, and was an all around\r\nprogressive business man. He was a Republican, and in 1862 was elected\r\nsheriff of Clinton county, being the first Republican elected to office\r\nin that county within a period of twenty-five years. During the Civil\r\nwar he was captain of the Home Guards. He died in 1893, age 64 years.\r\nCharles W. Ferguson is one of a family of six children, as follows: John\r\nL., assistant general passenger agent of the Chicago & Northwestern\r\nrailroad, Chicago, Ill.; Mary F., widow of M. B. Riley, and resides in\r\nSt. Joseph, Mo.; Adelia M., Plattsburg, Mo.; Katherine, Plattsburg, Mo.;\r\nCharles W., the subject of this sketch, and Louis, a conductor on the\r\nChicago & Northwestern railroad, resides at Highland Park, Ill. Charles\r\nW. Ferguson attended the public schools in Plattsburg until he was\r\nthirteen years old, and at that early age went to work in the express\r\noffice at Plattsburg, where he remained about five years. He then\r\nentered the employ of Stonum Brothers, remaining with that company two\r\nyears. He then accepted a position in the Plattsburg Bank, as bookkeeper\r\nand assistant cashier, remaining with that institution for seven years.\r\nHe then went with the Schuster-Hax National Bank, St. Joseph, Mo., as\r\nreceiving teller, and served in that capacity for four years. He\r\nresigned that position in June, 1894, to become bookkeeper of the\r\nExchange National Bank of Atchison. He served with that institution in\r\nthe capacity of paying teller, assistant cashier and cashier, resigning\r\nthe latter position February 1, 1914. In November, 1914, he accepted a\r\nposition with the Federal Reserve Bank, of Kansas City, Mo., and was\r\nwith that institution for eight months, and in July, 1915, became vice-\r\npresident of the Atchison Savings Bank. Mr. Ferguson has had a vast\r\nexperience in the field of banking, and is well posted on the intricate\r\nproblems of finance, and possesses the keen discriminating qualities of\r\nthe successful banker. Mr. Ferguson was married April 28, 1892, to Miss\r\nSallie Clay, of Plattsburg, Mo. She is a daughter of James M. Clay, a\r\nmember of the Kentucky branch of the Clay family. Mr. Ferguson is a\r\nmember of the Masonic lodge, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks\r\nand the Modern Woodmen of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             EARL V. JONES.\r\n\r\nSignal success in any one field of endeavor is worthy of recognition by\r\nthe public, whether it be professional, inventive, mercantile or of an\r\nindustrial nature. Some men are naturally gifted with the ability to\r\nbecome successful in the industrial and manufacturing field, and are\r\nmentally equipped with a certain amount of mechanical genius, along with\r\ndecided business ability to take hold of a proposition, and makes it\r\nsucceed, despite difficulties. E. V. Jones, treasurer and manager of the\r\nBailor Plow Company, of Atchison, is one of the latter type who is fast\r\nclimbing to a place of eminence in his chosen field of endeavor, and\r\nholds a high place among the manufacturing and mercantile interests of\r\nAtchison and the Middle West.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones was born in Livingston county, Missouri, January 21, 1878, a\r\nson of Charles Jones, a building contractor, who was a native of\r\nKentucky and a son of William Jones, owner of a large plantation in\r\nKentucky, which was lost as one of the misfortunes which befell the\r\nfamily as a result of the Civil war’s ravages in Kentucky. Desirous of\r\nmaking a new start in a land further removed from internecine strife,\r\nand where opportunities for success seemed greater, William Jones\r\nremoved to Missouri, and here Charles, the father of E. V., was reared\r\nand became successful in agricultural pursuits, the son, Earl V., being\r\nreared on the family estate in Livingston county, Missouri. The Jones\r\nfamily is originally of Scotch-Irish stock, the founder of the family\r\nemigrating from the north of Ireland to this country several generations\r\nago. Charles Jones married Miss Jennie Wills, a daughter of John Wills,\r\nnative of the east coast of England, and who immigrated to this country\r\nwith his brother, George, and followed his trade of wagon maker\r\nsuccessfully. John Wills owned and operated an extensive blacksmith and\r\nwagon maker’s shop at Chillicothe, Mo., which did a large business and\r\nmade moderate wealth for its proprietor.\r\n\r\nEarl V. Jones, with whom this review is directly concerned, was educated\r\nin the common and high schools of his native county, and attended the\r\nmilitary school at Palmyra, Mo., supplementing his academic education\r\nwith one year’s study in business college at Atchison, Kan. For some\r\nyears before the outbreak of the Spanish-American war, he had been a\r\nmember of the Missouri State militia, Company H, Fourth infantry\r\nregiment. When the war broke out and troops were called for to fight the\r\nSpaniards in Cuba and the Philippines, he responded with his company and\r\nregiment, and went to the front immediately, serving at Camp Alger, near\r\nWashington, D. C., on the Potomac river, and Camp Meade, at Harrisburg,\r\nPa., and at Greenville, S. C. After the close of the war, and receiving\r\nhis honorable discharge at Greenville, S. C., and being mustered out of\r\nthe service, he returned to his home city, Chillicothe, and entered the\r\nemploy of the Jackson Woodenware Company as a workman in 1899. His\r\ncapacity for work and an inherent genius for detail and management here\r\nasserted itself and his rise in this concern was rapid and substantial.\r\nIt was not long until his faithfulness and decided ability was\r\nrecognized by his employers and he was promoted to the post of\r\nsuperintendent of the factory. When the Jackson Woodenware Company was\r\nremoved to Atchison in 1902, Mr. Jones came along in the capacity of\r\nshipping clerk, and later served as superintendent of the company until\r\nits dissolution in 1910. During this time Mr. Jones had made a\r\nreputation as a manufacturer and organizer, which had become generally\r\nrecognized throughout this section of the country, and, although many\r\nflattering offers came to him to accept executive positions of\r\nimportance, he decided to cast his lot with the Bailor Plow Company as\r\ntreasurer and manager in 1910, when a company was organized for the\r\npurpose of locating the factory in Atchison. His judgment in this\r\nrespect was essentially sound, inasmuch as the Bailor Plow Company,\r\nunder his management, is one of the flourishing manufacturing concerns\r\nof the city. The company and Mr. Jones, the manager, have made good, the\r\nlarge payroll, and the constantly increasing output of the plant having\r\nfully justified the decision of the Atchison men who were instrumental\r\nin locating the plant in this city. A great future is decidedly in store\r\nfor the Bailor Plow Company and its manager.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones was united in marriage with Katherine Barton, of Livingston\r\ncounty, in 1901. To this union have been born two sons: Raymond and\r\nEarl. Mrs. Jones is a daughter of Prof. John W. Barton, widely known\r\neducator of Missouri, who formerly served as city superintendent of\r\nvarious schools, and was formerly a member of the faculty of the\r\nUniversity of Missouri.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones finds time, aside from his duties as manager of the factory,\r\nto take an active part in the social and civic life of Atchison, and has\r\nidentified himself with the city’s institutions in a substantial manner,\r\nas befitting a man of his position and attainments. He is a member of\r\nthe Masonic lodge, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the\r\nKnights of the Maccabees, and is affiliated with the United Commercial\r\nTravelers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MRS. JULIA E. ADAMS BOYINGTON.\r\n\r\nMrs. Julia E. Adams Boyington comes of parents who were important\r\nfactors in the early history of Atchison county. Her father, William\r\nAdams, came to Kansas in the fifties for the purpose of helping make\r\nKansas a free State. He was a leader of the Cayuga settlement and he was\r\nintimately connected with the making of Kansas history for many years.\r\nMrs. Boyington was born May 15, 1849, in Skaneateles, Onondaga county,\r\nNew York. Her parents, William and Mary Ann (Ellsbury) Adams, were both\r\nborn in England. The father was born October 6, 1820, in Summersetshire,\r\nEngland, and was a son of George Adams, who married Miss Thayer, also a\r\nnative of England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Home of_\r\n\r\n              _Frank W. and Julia (Adams) Boyington_\r\n\r\n  Extreme Left—SAMUEL ADAMS\r\n         Right—MRS JULIA E. BOYINGTON\r\n               FRANK W. BOYINGTON\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM ADAMS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MARY ANN ADAMS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt the age of seventeen, William Adams left his native country and came\r\nto New York. He farmed there until 1856, when he came to Kansas and\r\nsettled in Atchison county for the express purpose of helping John Brown\r\nin his fight along the border, and assisting the Free State party. He\r\npassed through many thrilling experiences during these troubled years\r\nand though he was often subjected to great bodily danger, he never\r\nwavered in his convictions and was always ready to fight for his\r\nconvictions. He preëmpted eighty acres of land which he increased to 800\r\nacres during his life time. When he took his first land the country was\r\nwild and undeveloped, and he built a log cabin on his place and used a\r\nyoke of oxen in breaking the land. He was a great stockman and kept a\r\nlarge number of animals and farmed until his death in 1889, remaining in\r\nactive life until within a short time of his death. Mr. Adams was a\r\nRepublican and was loyally devoted to the welfare of his party. He\r\nalways took a great deal of interest in the activities of his party and\r\nhelped it at every opportunity, though he never desired an office as a\r\nreward for his work, and never held a political job.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1848, Mr. Adams was married to Mary A. Ellsbury, also a\r\nnative of Summersetshire, England. She was born October 19, 1825, and\r\ndied December 15, 1895. Mrs. Boyington, though a small girl when she\r\ncame to Kansas, remembers many incidents of that early life with\r\nremarkable vividness. She still keeps a rifle and an old shot gun which\r\nher father brought from New York, and prizes them very highly. They were\r\nthe means of protecting her and her mother many times from the\r\ndepredations of the Indians, who were numerous in that section then, and\r\nlived on a reservation only four miles from the Adams home. They passed\r\nthe little Adams cabin when they went after whiskey. As they would\r\nreturn completely intoxicated, they would quarrel and disturb the\r\nneighborhood, often frightening the women whose husbands were working\r\nout in the fields. The Cayuga settlement numbered about forty people\r\nduring the early days. The township elections in Grasshopper township\r\nwere always held in the Adams house, and Mr. Adams was always generous\r\nin helping public affairs along.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Adams were parents of five children: Julia, the subject of\r\nthis sketch; Georgia Anna, deceased; Samuel, of Grasshopper township;\r\nMillicent, who died in infancy; Julia, born a twin, but the other child\r\ndied in infancy. Samuel, married Mrs. Ida Hitchcock, a native of\r\nScranton, Penn., in California, May 31, 1887. By her marriage to Mr.\r\nAdams she was the mother of two children: William J., who was born March\r\n19, 1890, and Earl, who was born October 10, 1891. These two children\r\nwere partly reared by their aunt, Mrs. Boyington, and she is very fond\r\nof them. Though she has no children of her own, she has made these two\r\nnephews her favorites and has treated them as though they were her own\r\nchildren. Frank W. Boyington, the husband of Julia E. Adams Boyington,\r\nwas born February 15, 1845, in Pennsylvania, and was a son of Edwin C.\r\nand Susan (Smith) Boyington, the former a native of Litchfield, Conn.,\r\nand the latter a native of Pennsylvania. In their old age they came to\r\nKansas and lived with their son, Frank W., and died here. The father\r\ndied 1872, and the mother died in 1875. He left there in 1867 and\r\nsettled in Grasshopper township, Atchison county, where Samuel Adams was\r\nreared to manhood in Grasshopper township; lived for ten years in\r\nCalifornia and returned to his farm in Grasshopper township in 1913. He\r\nwas married to Mrs. Julia Bartlet before his marriage to Miss Adams. His\r\nfirst wife was a school teacher in Grasshopper township before her\r\nmarriage. Three children were born to them. Edward, of Atchison, United\r\nStates mail clerk, Alice Spangler, Marion county, Kansas, and one\r\ndeceased. After her death in 1899, he was married to Miss Julia E.\r\nAdams, the subject of this sketch.\r\n\r\nMr. Boyington was an early settler in Kansas and has been a successful\r\nfarmer. His wife owns 480 acres of land which once was a part of the old\r\nhome place. Mr. Boyington owns 160 acres in Marion county, Kansas. He\r\nhas lived in Kansas since 1867 and has seen much history made during\r\nthat time. Mr. Boyington is a Republican and is a member of the Ancient\r\nFree and Accepted Masons. Although he is not a church member, he attends\r\nservices. Mr. Boyington is one of the most successful farmers of\r\nAtchison county, and with his wife, who is also a good manager, has made\r\na financial success of farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN L. BLAIR.\r\n\r\nThe historian must ever take cognizance of the facts concerning the\r\nlives of those who have contributed most to the upbuilding and the\r\nwelfare of their community. In looking backward over the half century,\r\nand more, which has elapsed since the Kansas Territory was thrown open\r\nto settlement, it is found that there are quite a number of men and\r\nwomen who are deserving of more than mere casual mention in the history\r\nof Atchison county. Among these are John L. and Amanda (Meeker) Blair,\r\nwhose names will go down in history as having taken a very prominent\r\npart in the social, political and intellectual development of Doniphan\r\nand Atchison counties. Mrs. Blair has the honored distinction of having\r\nbeen the first public school teacher in Atchison and she and her husband\r\nwere prominently identified with the historical course of events in\r\nnortheast Kansas for a long period of years.\r\n\r\nJohn L. Blair, deceased, was born in Fayette county, Pennsylvania, April\r\n25, 1833, a son of Alexander and Rachel (Lynch) Blair. The family is of\r\nIrish origin. Alexander Blair was a minister of the Methodist Episcopal\r\nchurch in Pennsylvania. He died in Pennsylvania, and in 1860 the widow\r\njoined John L., who had come to Kansas in 1858. They settled in Doniphan\r\ncounty, near the Atchison-Doniphan line. Mr. Blair developed a fine farm\r\nand made quite a reputation as a breeder of fine live stock, being one\r\nof the pioneer stock breeders of Kansas. In 1863 he was united in\r\nmarriage with Amanda Meeker. This was after he had served some time in\r\nthe Civil war as a member of Company D, Seventh regiment, Kansas\r\ncavalry, as a sergeant, enlisting at the beginning of the war and\r\nserving for two years. After being mustered out, he returned home and\r\nwas married in June of 1863. Mr. and Mrs. Blair immediately moved to a\r\nfarm in Doniphan county, Kansas, and were successful from the start.\r\nBoth being endowed with more than ordinary intelligence and thrift, they\r\nforesaw the inevitable rise in land values and invested all of their\r\nearnings in land, accumulating over 600 acres of land which was located\r\nin Doniphan county and since Mr. Blair’s demise Mrs. Blair has purchased\r\n320 acres in Lyon county, Kansas. Mr. Blair was an active and\r\ninfluential figure in the civic and political life of Doniphan county,\r\nand frequently stumped the county in the interest of the Republican\r\nparty candidates. He was a public speaker of power and ability, and was\r\na warm adherent of the cause of women suffrage, stumping Atchison and\r\nDoniphan counties in 1884 in the interest of the suffrage movement in\r\nKansas. He filled the office of county commissioner of Doniphan county\r\nfor two terms, and was at one time a candidate for State senator. During\r\nthe years 1873 and 1874, when the Grange movement was spreading over\r\nKansas, Mr. Blair was the official organizer for Atchison and Doniphan\r\ncounties. He had a good knowledge of parliamentary law and this came in\r\nvery useful in his work among the different granges. It was in the\r\nGrange meetings that the movement for woman suffrage first gained\r\nheadway in Kansas, and the women learned how to vote. Mr. Blair died in\r\n1891, February 4. To Mr. and Mrs. Blair were born the following\r\nchildren: Mamie, widow of James Hunter, of Doniphan county, and mother\r\nof two children; Alexander, a farmer in Doniphan county and father of\r\nseven children; Kate, wife of Thomas Evans, a breeder of fine Hereford\r\ncattle, hackney horses and pure bred hogs, in Lyon county, and who is\r\nthe owner of the famous hackney mare formerly owned by Jay Gould. Mrs.\r\nEvans was educated in the schools of Doniphan county, and the old Monroe\r\nInstitute of Atchison, and is a graduate of Holton University, at\r\nHolton, Kan., and graduated from the Kansas State University at Lawrence\r\nin 1893. Mr. and Mrs. Evans have one daughter, Mary Frances. Mrs. Blair\r\nhas ten grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Mr. and Mrs. Blair\r\nbelonged to the Methodist Episcopal Church and he was an Odd Fellow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Amanda (Meeker) Blair was born in Franklin county, Ohio, near the\r\ncity of Columbus, June 24, 1837. She was a daughter of Caleb and Mary\r\n(Grant) Meeker, her mother being a relative of Gen. U. S. Grant, and her\r\nfather being a member of the famous Meeker family of America. Ezra\r\nMeeker, who crossed the continent en route to Oregon with an ox team,\r\nwas a second cousin of Caleb Meeker. Caleb Meeker was born in New\r\nJersey, a son of Aaron, who was born in New Jersey, of German origin.\r\nCaleb Meeker was born in Essex county, New Jersey, August 9, 1807, a son\r\nof Aaron Meeker, also of New Jersey, who had eight sons and four sons-\r\nin-law in the Meeker, also of New Jersey. Aaron was a brother of Timothy\r\nMeeker, who had eight sons and four sons-in-law in the American army\r\nduring the Revolutionary war. Mary Grant Meeker was born in\r\nPennsylvania. In 1808 the Meeker family migrated from New Jersey to Ohio\r\nand resided there until 1857, when they went to Fulton county, Illinois,\r\nstopping for one year. In November of 1858 Amanda Meeker came to\r\nAtchison to take a position as teacher in the first public school in\r\nAtchison. Caleb came in January of 1859 to visit his daughter and\r\ninvested in a tract of land near Huron, Kan., moving his family in\r\nMarch, 1859. He lived on his farm all the rest of his life, dying in\r\nSeptember, 1886. Amanda was educated in the district schools of her\r\nnative county in Ohio and received a certificate to teach school when\r\nbut fifteen years of age. She taught three months in 1852 for $9.00 per\r\nmonth and then attended school for the remainder of the season. The\r\nfollowing year she taught six months for $20 per month, after which she\r\nstudied for two years in the Ohio Wesleyan University, at Delaware,\r\nOhio. Her teaching experience embraced six years in Ohio, five months in\r\nIllinois and three years in Atchison and six months in Hiawatha, Kan.\r\nMrs. Blair was a very successful teacher, and had the faculty of\r\nexercising great control over her pupils.\r\n\r\nA brother, Jeptha Meeker, served in the Union army during the Civil war.\r\nMrs. Blair kept the postoffice at Huron, Atchison county, when the\r\nvillage was one of the stations on the old Military road, from Ft.\r\nLeavenworth to Denver and Pike’s Peak, Colo.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blair is distinguished among the pioneer women of Atchison county\r\nas having been the first public school teacher in the county appointed\r\nby a board of education, duly organized and elected. During the summer\r\nof 1858, this board was organized in the office of F. G. Adams in\r\nAtchison, and the members of the board were Dr. William Grimes,\r\ntreasurer; F. G. Adams, clerk; James A. Coulter, director; Philip D.\r\nPlattenburg, principal of the schools at Lewistown, Ill., had been\r\nengaged as superintendent of the Atchison schools and this board elected\r\nAmanda Meeker as his assistant. This was the first public school in the\r\ncity of Atchison, and was located over a grocery store in a frame\r\nbuilding, where the Y. M. C. A. edifice now stands at the corner of\r\nFourth and Commercial streets. The school term began on November 1,\r\n1858, and lasted for seven month, ending July 1, 1859. The following\r\nyear the school term was extended to nine months. Miss Meeker taught for\r\nthree years without a certificate. The first teacher’s certificate in\r\nAtchison county was issued to W. D. Rippey, a young man who came from\r\nValparaiso, Ind. Mrs. Blair recalls that Mr. Rippey had no intention of\r\nteaching when he came to Atchison, and remained here for about five\r\nmonths and then went to Doniphan county, where he became quite wealthy\r\nin the course of years. Applicants for teacher’s certificates had little\r\nor no trouble in passing, the whole procedure of examining being\r\nconducted verbally and the chief requisite apparently being the one\r\ndollar fee which was required from the applicant.\r\n\r\nFew Kansas pioneer women at this day occupy the honored position in\r\nhistory which is held by Mrs. Blair. To have taught the first public\r\nschool in Atchison is a great honor, and to have been one of the\r\npioneers of a great State in such a capacity is a great honor which is\r\nclaimed by very few people. Mrs. Blair, despite her age, is possessed of\r\na keen mentality and is remarkably well preserved, her long life being\r\nbest attributed to her mental vigor and student powers which she has\r\nkept nourished these many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ALFRED SHORTRIDGE.\r\n\r\nAlfred Shortridge, deceased pioneer of Atchison, was born in Milton,\r\nInd., February 27, 1834. When twenty-three years of age he listened to\r\nthe admonition of his elders to come to the great West, where\r\nopportunities for amassing a competence were much better for a young man\r\nthan in his home community. He came by train to St. Louis and after\r\nstopping a few days at the Planter’s Hotel, he boarded a Missouri river\r\nsteamer which brought him to Atchison. His intention was to get a farm\r\nfrom the Government, and he accordingly took up a claim one-half mile\r\nsouth of Monrovia. He developed his homestead, sold it and later bought\r\na farm, ten miles south of Atchison, in Walnut township, near Potter. He\r\nadded to this first farm of 120 acres until he became the owner of a\r\nfinely developed farm of 200 acres, which he still owned at the time of\r\nhis demise.\r\n\r\nMr. Shortridge was one of the early day freighters and during the years\r\nof 1862 and 1863 he freighted from Atchison to Denver, and in 1863 made\r\ntwo trips overland to Denver and return with Pardee Butler, with whom he\r\nwas on intimate terms. He enlisted in the company of soldiers which was\r\nformed in his neighborhood for the purpose of repelling Price’s invasion\r\nof Kansas in 1864 and was present at Westport when Price’s army of\r\ninvasion was driven southward. After he had made his last trip to Denver\r\nin 1863, he sold his wagon and four mules for $1,500, and then engaged\r\nin farming. He resided on his farm near Potter until the year 1912, and\r\nthen removed to a home in Atchison.\r\n\r\nHe was married February 23, 1867, to Miss Catherine Elizabeth Clasby, of\r\nDeKalb, Buchanan county, Missouri, and to this union five children were\r\nborn as follows: Mrs. J. A. Edwards, Fairmount. Kan.; J. T. Shortridge,\r\nW. O. Shortridge, and Mrs. C. N. Faulkner, of Potter, Kan., and Miss\r\nFlorence Shortridge, at home. The mother of these children was born\r\nMarch 20, 1843, a daughter of John D. and Sarah Ann (Ellison) Clasby.\r\nJohn D. Clasby was a native of Virginia, whose mother was a member of\r\nthe Dunlap family of Virginia, one of the old colonial families of\r\nAmerica. One of the Dunlaps, a direct ancestor of Mrs. Shortridge,\r\nserved in the Continental army in the Revolutionary war. He was a\r\npioneer settler of Buchanan county, Missouri, and is buried on a hill\r\nwithin sight of Atchison.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shortridge’s mother, Sarah Ann (Ellison) Clasby, was born in\r\nMissouri, a daughter of James and Elizabeth (Dunlap) Ellison, who were\r\nresidents of Kentucky, and who were among the pioneer settlers in\r\nBuchanan county, Missouri. There were nine children in the Clasby\r\nfamily, as follows: James T., Robert, Orlando, Joseph, Franklin, Julian,\r\ndeceased; Mrs. Ann Eliza (Stewart), and Mrs. Alfred Shortridge.\r\n\r\nAlfred Shortridge departed this life on July 17, 1915, and was sincerely\r\nmourned by a host of friends and acquaintances who had known him for\r\nmany years in Atchison county. During his life, after attaining his\r\nmajority he was affiliated with the Republican party, and was always\r\nactive in the affairs of his party, although he was never a seeker after\r\npolitical preferment. He was a member of the Christian church, and lived\r\naccording to the precepts of his religious belief, as nearly as mortal\r\nman could. He carried his religion into his daily life and believed\r\nimplicitly in the golden rule, which admonishes mankind to treat his\r\nneighbor as he would have his neighbor do unto him.\r\n\r\nOn February 23, 1911, Mr. and Mrs. Shortridge celebrated their forty-\r\nfourth wedding anniversary at the old Shortridge homestead, and it was a\r\nfitting culmination of one of the happiest life unions on record. Mr.\r\nShortridge was deeply devoted to his noble wife and family and was\r\nalways kind and considerate, not only with the members of his immediate\r\nfamily, but with his many friends and acquaintances. He was never known\r\nto complain or find fault but took things as he found them and made the\r\nbest of every occasion. One of the last of the old guard of Atchison\r\npioneers, he was a fitting example of the type which did so much to\r\ndevelop the Sunflower State and make Atchison county one of the garden\r\nspots of the country. One by one the old pioneers are passing to the\r\ngreat beyond from which no man returneth; it is fitting that we record\r\nin imperishable print the record of their lives and their deeds and\r\naccomplishments while on earth in order that it all may live after them\r\nforever and their memories be kept continually green and fresh in the\r\nminds of succeeding generations which will know them not except through\r\nthe pages of these Atchison county historical annals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             O. M. BABCOCK.\r\n\r\nO. M. Babcock, of the Babcock-Avensberg Shoe Company, is one of the most\r\nprogressive merchants of Atchison. He is a native of the Empire State,\r\nand was born at Adams Center, Jefferson county, New York, in November,\r\n1872, and is a son of M. S. and Amy (Green) Babcock, both natives of New\r\nYork and of English descent.\r\n\r\nThe Babcock family was founded in America by Capt. James Babcock, who\r\nsettled in Rhode Island during the seventeenth century. M. S. Babcock\r\ncame to Kansas with his family in 1883 and settled on a farm in Benton\r\ntownship, one mile north of Nortonville in Atchison county. Here he\r\nbought 160 acres of unimproved land, which he developed to a high state\r\nof cultivation and followed farming there successfully until he and his\r\nwife removed to Battle Creek, Mich., where they now reside. O. M.\r\nBabcock, the subject of this sketch, was eleven years old when he came\r\nto Atchison county with his parents. He was educated in the district\r\nschools and the Atchison County High School at Effingham. After\r\ncompleting school he taught in Atchison county about two years when he\r\naccepted a position in a general merchandise store at Nortonville and\r\nlater at Effingham. He remained at Effingham one year and then came to\r\nAtchison and entered the shoe department of D. C. Newcomb’s general\r\nstore, where he remained about three years. He then accepted a position\r\nas traveling salesman for a wholesale shoe house, and for three years\r\nwas a successful knight of the grip with St. Joseph, Mo., as his\r\nheadquarters. He then came to Atchison as general sales manager for a\r\nretail shoe establishment, and four years later, in 1902, organized the\r\nBabcock Shoe Company, which he still conducts. This is Atchison’s\r\nleading shoe store.\r\n\r\nMr. Babcock was united in marriage in 1903 to Miss Edith L. Hooper, a\r\ndaughter of George R. Hooper, of Atchison, a personal sketch of whom\r\nappears in this volume. Mr. Babcock takes a keen interest and an active\r\npart in the welfare and development of Atchison and is one of its\r\nbooster citizens. He is a member of the Masonic lodge and active in the\r\nwork of that organization. He is also a member of the Elks and belongs\r\nto the Commercial Club. He is president of the Kansas Retail Shoe\r\nDealers’ Association, and politically, is a supporter of the policies\r\nand principles of the Republican party.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JULIUS KUHN.\r\n\r\nJulius Kuhn, deceased pioneer merchant of Atchison, was a man of\r\nsterling worth, industry and purpose who achieved a success in the\r\ncommercial life of his adopted city which ranked with the greatest\r\naccomplishments of those who figured most prominently in the early civic\r\nlife of Atchison. He was born in Bavaria, Germany, May 10, 1831, and\r\nreceived an excellent education in the famous university at Munich,\r\nwhere he fitted himself to become an architect. He was gifted with more\r\nthan ordinary talent as a draughtsman and architect and to this day many\r\nof his best drawings and designs are hanging on the walls of the art\r\nroom in St. Benedict’s College. When twenty years of age he took passage\r\non a sailing vessel for America, then as now, the land of promise for\r\nthe poor and ambitious youth of the old world. After a stay of a few\r\nyears in New York City and points in Connecticut, he journeyed to St.\r\nLouis where he was married, his wife, Lucetta, dying in Atchison in the\r\nspring of 1881. To this union one son was born, Gustave, who died July\r\n15, 1883. While in St. Louis Mr. Kuhn heard tales of the opportunities\r\nwaiting for industrious young men in the new State of Kansas and came\r\nhither to seek his fortune in the year 1859. He had some means which he\r\nhad saved and at once invested in a lot on the corner of Eighth and\r\nCommercial streets, upon which he built a story and a half frame\r\nbuilding, which for many years was a well known landmark in Atchison. He\r\ninstalled a stock of groceries in his new building, and from the start\r\nmet with success. His store soon became the outfitting point for the\r\nfreighters who were crossing the plains to the far western points and he\r\nprospered in excess even of his expectations. Mr. Kuhn’s store was\r\nrarely closed in those early days and it was his wont to retire at 1\r\no’clock a. m. and was often called out of bed at 3 o’clock in the\r\nmorning to assist some freighter just arriving from the trail half\r\nfrozen, or, perchance, to trade with some farmer who had traveled a long\r\ndistance to transact business with him and exchange his produce for\r\ngroceries and necessities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Julius Kuhn_\r\n]\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil war he served in the commissary department of the Union\r\narmy, called out to repel the invasion of Kansas, threatened by General\r\nPrice. He established himself in the wholesale business in 1870 as he\r\nforesaw that Atchison was to become an important distributing point for\r\nthe northeastern part of the State as the country grew more and more\r\nsettled with the influx of immigrants from all parts of the compass. In\r\ntime the little frame store, which he had erected when he first came to\r\nAtchison, was replaced by the pretentious brick structure which bears\r\nhis name. He invested his surplus profits in real estate in Atchison and\r\nKansas points and left a substantial fortune on his demise. In the early\r\nsixties he purchased for his family residence the old Judge Gilham\r\nhouse, at that time the only house on the hill, from his store\r\nnorthwestward. For a number of years the Kuhn store was the only\r\nbusiness house west of Third street, but in time the business center\r\ngradually moved westward from the river, and encompassed his business\r\nplace. Speaking reminiscently of those early days a few incidents\r\nshowing conditions at that time are worth recording. When Mr. Bartholow\r\nfirst came to Atchison, at the outbreak of the Civil war when business\r\nwas in a state of paralysis, he had on hand over $2,000 worth of\r\ntobacco, for which he could not find storage. He approached Mr. Kuhn and\r\nasked him to either buy the stock or store it until such a time as it\r\nwould be marketable. Mr. Kuhn took a chance and when tobacco soared to\r\nan extremely high price toward the last days of the war, he disposed of\r\nit at a profit of $1.00 per pound. Flour rose to the high price of $7.00\r\nper sack during those troublous days, while beef was very cheap, a “half\r\nof beef” often selling for ten cents.\r\n\r\nMr. Kuhn was married the second time, September 30, 1883, to Anna\r\nGlattfelter, and to this union were born two sons, Julius Otto, at home\r\nwith his mother, and Gustave Adolphus, living in Kansas City, married\r\nIrene King, and is the father of one child, Ruth Kuhn. Mrs. Anna\r\nGlattfelter Kuhn was born in Glattfelter, Switzerland, a daughter of\r\nHenry and Margaret Glattfelter, who immigrated to America in 1864, and\r\nlocated on a farm in Atchison county. Henry Glattfelter died in 1867,\r\nand his wife died in Atchison in 1903. They were the parents of Mrs. W.\r\nA. Dilgert, living on a farm in Walnut township; Mrs. Martin Dilgert,\r\nresiding on Ninth street; Margaret, wife of Mr. John Meyer, living on\r\nSeventh street; Fannie, wife of Dr. Sievers, of Manning, Iowa; Henry, on\r\nthe old home farm, near Cummings. Mrs. Kuhn resides in the family\r\nresidence at 1029 Atchison street, and looks after the interest of the\r\nKuhn estate. She is a keen, intelligent lady, who has shown marked\r\nbusiness ability in caring for the property interests left in her\r\ncharge. Mr. Kuhn retired from active mercantile pursuits in 1889, and\r\ndied October 30, 1902, universally respected and loved by all who knew\r\nhim. He was a Republican in politics and took an active part in the\r\ncivic and political affairs of Atchison, serving as a member of the city\r\ncouncil, and filling several important city offices of trust during his\r\nlong residence here. He was always a consistent and unremitting booster\r\nfor Atchison, and had a deep love for the city and his home life. He was\r\na member of the Elks and a social member of the Turner Society. Mr. Kuhn\r\nwas not a member of any religious denomination but was a friend and\r\nliberal supporter of all denominations which sought his aid. While not a\r\nprofessed Christian he lived a blameless and upright life, and was ever\r\nready to assist a needy acquaintance when his aid would do the most\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PETER WEBER.\r\n\r\nPeter Weber, retired farmer, residing at 921 North Sixth street,\r\nAtchison, Kan., is one of the real pioneer residents of the county. He\r\nhas lived in the county for over fifty-six years, and recalls many of\r\nthe incidents of the old days when the settlement of the county was in\r\nthe embryo stage. Like most of the prosperous and successful men in the\r\ncounty he has worked his way upward from a small beginning to a state of\r\naffluence, which reflects credit upon his industry and his capabilities.\r\nTimes, fifty years ago, and the present, give opportunity for making\r\ncontrasts which are striking and very interesting. When Mr. Weber was a\r\nboy it was the family custom to go to church on Sundays via the ox wagon\r\nroute, father, mother and all of the children seating themselves in a\r\nbig farm wagon, and going to church at the rate of two miles per hour,\r\nthe trip requiring almost the entire day to go and return. Now, Mr.\r\nWeber cranks the engine of his fine automobile, and in an incredibly\r\nshort space of time he travels from his city home to his country estate,\r\ncan spend hours in looking over the farming operations, and return to\r\nhis own home in time for the next meal.\r\n\r\nPeter Weber was born in Kenosha, Wis., March 8, 1859, and came to\r\nAtchison county with his parents a few weeks later. His father, John\r\nWeber, was a native of Luxemburg, Germany, and his mother was Mary\r\n(Penning) Weber, also a native of Luxemburg, and a daughter of Nicholas\r\nPenning, who emigrated from his native country to Wisconsin. John Weber\r\nwas married in Wisconsin, after coming to this country. He migrated to\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, from Wisconsin in 1859, and was equipped with a\r\ncash capital of nearly $300. He attended a lot sale in the boom days of\r\nOld Sumner, and invested nearly all of his savings in lots, purchasing\r\n275 lots in all, at prices varying from $5 for the first one bought, to\r\na price as low as twenty-five cents. This was more or less a speculation\r\non his part, and the price of lots in Sumner fell rapidly after the\r\ncounty seat election which selected Atchison as the seat of government\r\nfor the county. Real estate values naturally deteriorated in Sumner, and\r\nJohn Weber later sold seventy-five of his lots for $15 and allowed the\r\ngreater part of his initial Kansas investment to be sold for taxes,\r\ninasmuch as the property had no real value. His next investment was a\r\nmuch better one, however, and he purchased 160 acres of land in Walnut\r\ntownship for $360, on which he erected a home and proceeded to develop\r\nit into a fine farm. He became well to do, and was highly respected\r\nthroughout the neighborhood in which he resided. Originally John Weber\r\nhad been a wheelwright by trade, and his skill as a wood worker and\r\nwagon maker stood him in good stead when he took up agricultural\r\npursuits in Atchison county. During the Civil war John Weber was\r\nenrolled in the State militia and was called away to serve his country\r\nat Independence, Mo., leaving his wife and young children at home in\r\nmortal fear of their lives while the father and his comrades were in\r\nbattle array to repel the Price invasion of Kansas. The movable property\r\nof the family was kept hidden in the drawers. Mr. Weber had over $800 in\r\ngold buried in the cellar in an empty peach can. He reared a fine family\r\nof sons and daughters as follows: Peter, the eldest of the family and\r\nwith whom this review is directly concerned; Mathias, who is cultivating\r\nthe old home place in Mt. Pleasant township, and Mrs. Katherine Keefer,\r\na widow residing near Nortonville, Kan., are the surviving children of a\r\nfamily of six born, three of whom died in infancy. John Weber died in\r\n1905, his wife preceding him to the great beyond in 1901.\r\n\r\nPeter Weber, when a boy, attended the district school of his\r\nneighborhood in Mt. Pleasant township, and was reared to become an\r\nagriculturist. He was married in 1881 and then began doing for himself,\r\nrenting land in Mt. Pleasant township for a time and carefully\r\nhusbanding his resources and saving his money with a view to eventually\r\nowning a farm of his own. He was enabled to purchase his first farm of\r\n160 acres in 1895 in Walnut township. He still owns this fine farm,\r\nwhich is one of the best in Atchison county, and is now being cultivated\r\nby his son. Mr. Weber retired from active agricultural pursuits in May,\r\n1912, and removed to Atchison, where he owns real estate and lives\r\ncomfortably, as befitting a man who has earned the right to enjoy home\r\ncomforts. He was married in 1881 to Mary Weinmann, and to this union\r\nhave been born the following children: Mary, wife of Theo Vanderweide,\r\nof Atchison county; Katherine, wife of John Wagner, residing in Walnut\r\ntownship, Atchison county; Jacob, living on the home farm; Ida, wife of\r\nCharles Harrison, a foreman in the A. J. Harwi Hardware Store, in\r\nAtchison; Annie, wife of Gustave Boehme, Rulo, Neb., where Mr. Boehme\r\nconducts a bakery. The mother of these children was born August 9, 1860,\r\nin Salt Creek Valley, Leavenworth county, Kansas, a daughter of Jacob\r\nand Katherine Weinmann, natives of Germany, who came to Leavenworth\r\ncounty, Kansas, as early as 1858. She was one of sixteen children born\r\nto these parents, thirteen of whom were reared, and five came to America\r\nand died here.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber has always been a Democrat, but is more or less independent in\r\nhis political views and believes in voting for the candidate who seems\r\nbest fitted to perform the duties of the office, regardless of his\r\npolitical affiliations. While a resident of Mt. Pleasant township he\r\ntook an active part in the civic affairs of the township and served nine\r\nyears as treasurer and then served as trustee in 1895. Later when he\r\ntook up a permanent residence in Walnut township, in 1896, he was\r\nselected as township treasurer by the people in 1906 and filled the\r\noffice to the satisfaction of everybody for six years. He and the\r\nmembers of his family are members of the St. Benedict’s Catholic Church,\r\nand have always been liberal contributors to the support of this\r\ninstitution. He is also affiliated with the Knights of Columbus, and\r\ntakes a keen interest in city and county affairs as befitting a man of\r\nbroad general attainments, who has lived in Atchison county for over\r\nhalf a century and watched its evolution from a wilderness to become one\r\nof the fairest divisions of the great State of Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ROBERT F. BISHOP.\r\n\r\nRobert F. Bishop, farmer, residing in Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, and whose farm is located two and one-half miles west of\r\nPotter, is one of the most substantial and progressive agriculturists of\r\nhis neighborhood. He was born August 16, 1861, in the town of Watkins,\r\nin Schuyler county, New York, at the foot of Watkins Glen, which is now\r\na noted summer resort, and one of the most beautiful spots in all New\r\nYork. He is a son of Freeman and Annie (Sims) Bishop, both of whom were\r\nborn and reared in New York State and descendants of old eastern\r\nfamilies. The Bishop family is of English origin and is descended from\r\nold colonial stock, members of which figured in the early wars in which\r\nAmerica has been engaged. The Sims family is of Scotch and Irish\r\nextraction. The Bishops were early settlers in the section of New York\r\nwhere Robert F. Bishop was born. Freeman was a ship carpenter by trade\r\nwho followed his trade in New York, and in 1872 came to Kansas, settling\r\nin Jefferson county on a farm, where he prospered and reared his family\r\nof four children, Robert F. being the eldest.\r\n\r\nHe of whom this review is written was a boy ten years of age when the\r\nfamily came to Kansas to make a permanent home. He lived on the home\r\nplace and assisted his father in the cultivation of his farm until he\r\nwas twenty-four years of age, then married, and two years later, in\r\n1885, came to Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison county, and purchased the\r\nold Miller farm consisting of 180 acres of good, tillable land. Mr.\r\nBishop has added to his original farm as he was able and now owns 261\r\n1–2 acres all in one body and well improved. Besides his home farm he is\r\nalso the owner of another tract of 208 acres, which makes his total\r\nacreage 469 1–2 acres in all. The accumulation of this amount of land in\r\nabout thirty years is a considerable undertaking, in Kansas especially,\r\nwhen the possessor had very little of this world’s goods at the start of\r\nhis career. Mr. Bishop began with very little capital but imbued with a\r\ndetermination to succeed and the willingness to work hard and deny\r\nhimself the luxuries of life until he was well able to afford them. When\r\nhe purchased his first farm his cash capital was so limited that he was\r\nforced to go in debt for two-thirds of the purchase price of the land.\r\nSince then he has risen to become one of the wealthy farmers of Atchison\r\ncounty, and has one of the finest and best improved places in Kansas,\r\nequipped with excellent buildings and a modern silo. His farm is\r\nconsidered a model one in the county and was one of the first to be\r\nvisited by the county farm visitors for the purpose of ascertaining the\r\nprogress made and using it as a model for others in the county. Mr.\r\nBishop is a natural born agriculturist who has kept pace with the\r\nadvancement made in the science of agriculture, and is blessed with an\r\nintuitive knowledge of the best methods of tilling the soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Bishop was married in 1883 to Elizabeth Shaw, a daughter of Henry\r\nShaw, well-to-do farmer of Leavenworth county. To this union have been\r\nborn seven children, namely: Caude, a farmer, in Atchison county;\r\nCurtis, a farmer; Robert, living at home and assisting his father in the\r\nfarm operations; Myrtle S., Mable, Maude, and Irene, at home with their\r\nparents. The father of Mrs. Bishop is the owner of the old Penseneau\r\nfarm, which is the first piece of land ever tilled in Atchison county.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party has generally had the allegiance of Mr. Bishop, and\r\nwhile he has not taken an active part in political matters, he was one\r\nof the stanch supporters of the movement which resulted in the\r\nestablishment of the high school at Potter. It is only natural to learn\r\nthat he, like others who have succeeded in Kansas, has always been a\r\nlive stock man and believes in feeding the grains and grasses raised on\r\nhis land to the live stock on his place, in order to preserve the\r\nfertility of the land and make marketing the output much more\r\nconvenient. He maintains a dairy herd of thirty well bred Holstein milch\r\ncows and is a well known breeder of Duroc Jersey hogs, having 200 head\r\nor more on his farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HARRISON W. RUDOLPH.\r\n\r\nHarrison W. Rudolph is not only a leading photographer of Atchison, but\r\nranks among the best in his profession of the entire country. Mr.\r\nRudolph is a native of the Keystone State, born at Allentown, Pa., May\r\n30, 1866. He is a son of John and Levina (Messer) Rudolph. The Rudolphs\r\nare of old American stock of German descent. Sometime during the\r\nseventeenth century, two Rudolph brothers immigrated to America. One\r\nsettled in Pennsylvania, and the other went farther West, locating in\r\nOhio, and Harrison W. Rudolph, whose name introduces this review, is a\r\ndescendant of the one who settled in Pennsylvania. Mrs. James A.\r\nGarfield bore the maiden name of Rudolph, and was a member of the Ohio\r\nbranch of the Rudolph family, and James Rudolph Garfield, son of the\r\nformer President, retains his mother’s maiden name as his middle name.\r\nJohn Rudolph, the father of H. W., is now living and has reached the\r\nripe old age of eighty. He resides in Allentown, Pa.\r\n\r\nHarrison W. Rudolph was reared in Allentown, and after receiving a good\r\ncommon school education served an apprenticeship at photography in his\r\nnative city, and later completed a course in the Atchison Business\r\nCollege. About the time he was twenty years old he obtained a position\r\nfrom an Atchison photographer through correspondence. He came here and\r\nworked at his profession for M. A. Kleckner about nine years, when he\r\nopened a studio of his own at 509 1–2 Commercial street, where he has\r\nbeen located for twenty years. Mr. Rudolph is recognized as an artist\r\nand has a large patronage from all over northeastern Kansas, and he even\r\ngets work from Kansas City. The excellency of his work is readily\r\nrecognized by particular people who know and appreciate art. Mr. Rudolph\r\nhas been awarded five prizes and medals for his work by the Kansas State\r\nPhotographers’ Association, and his work is always in great demand. He\r\nis a member of the Kansas Photographers’ Association, the National\r\nPhotographers’ Association of America, the Missouri Valley\r\nPhotographers’ Association, the Modern Woodmen of America, and the\r\nMethodist Episcopal church.\r\n\r\nMr. Rudolph was married in Denver April 9, 1889, to Miss Martha Hausser,\r\nof New York City, and two children have been born to this union, as\r\nfollows: Rodney, born January 21, 1892, is a traveling representative\r\nfor the Standard Oil Company, and Fred, born June 2, 1894, a clerk in\r\nthe Atchison office of the Standard Oil Company. Mr. Rudolph is not only\r\na successful artist, but has made good in a financial way and is one of\r\nthe substantial business men of Atchison county. He is a member of the\r\nAtchison Commercial Club and the Young Men’s Christian Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EDWARD B. McCULLOUGH.\r\n\r\nEdward B. McCullough, deputy sheriff of Atchison county, was born on a\r\nfarm in Atchison county in 1880, and is a son of Hugh Elden and Sarah J.\r\n(Rankin) McCullough, both of whom were born and reared to maturity in\r\nPennsylvania, married there and shortly afterward set out for the West,\r\nsettling in Atchison county. Mr. McCullough bought a farm in Lancaster\r\ntownship, and improved it, but did not live long after settling here. He\r\ndied at the age of twenty-eight years, leaving one son, Edward B. At the\r\ntime of his father’s death, Edward B. was but fifteen months old, and\r\nsoon afterward his mother moved to the village of Lancaster where she\r\nhas since made her home, with the exception of some years spent on her\r\ncousin’s farm near Lancaster. Edward B. was reared to young manhood in\r\nLancaster and attended the public school. When still a youth he learned\r\nto hustle for himself and became self-reliant and self-supporting at a\r\ntime when most boys are still in the coddling stage. When but sixteen\r\nyears of age he bought a team and outfit and engaged in business for\r\nhimself. He continued as a teamster and in draying until 1914 when he\r\nremoved to Atchison to enter upon his duties as deputy sheriff under\r\nSheriff Roy Trimble. During the course of his teaming experience he\r\nbecame the proprietor of a livery barn in Lancaster.\r\n\r\nOn October 28, 1903, he married Mildred May Lowe, a daughter of Austin\r\nand Anna Lowe, of Atchison county. They have one child, Gayle Mateel,\r\nborn September 23, 1904. Mr. McCullough is a member of the Modern\r\nWoodmen, and is a Republican. Since early young manhood he has taken an\r\nactive part in political affairs, and loves the game for its own sake,\r\nas well as he loves baseball and kindred sports, for he is and has been\r\nquite an athlete, being a proficient baseball player.\r\n\r\nFor the past eight years he has been one of the wheel horses of the\r\nRepublican party in Atchison county and has naturally attained a wide\r\nacquaintance among the voters of both parties. He assiduously campaigned\r\nfor his favorite candidates during the campaigns of 1912 and 1914, but\r\nhas never been a candidate for office. He was appointed to the post of\r\ndeputy sheriff in November, 1914, and took up the duties of his office\r\nJanuary 11, of the following year. It is needless to state that he is\r\nfaithfully performing the duties of his position and is gaining more\r\nfriends as his general worth is becoming more widely known.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THOMAS E. BALLINGER.\r\n\r\nThomas E. Ballinger is one of the substantial and well respected\r\nresidents of Atchison who has accomplished much in a material and civic\r\nway since first coming to the county in 1869. He has acquired and\r\nimproved one of the finest farms of the county, served the people well\r\nand faithfully in an official capacity, and, best of all, has reared a\r\nfine family, every member of whom is a useful addition to society, and a\r\ncredit to their parents and the communities in which they reside. What\r\nmore could any man expect to accomplish during a long and busy life? A\r\nman who accomplishes so much with the assistance of an intelligent and\r\nfaithful wife can well be content to retire to a pleasant home, imbued\r\nwith the satisfaction of knowing that the future of himself and his is\r\nwell provided for during the declining years which can be likened to a\r\nbeautiful sunset at the end of a long and glorious day spent in gleaning\r\nfrom mother earth her treasures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Thos. E. Ballinger_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Julia H. Ballinger_\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Ballinger is a native of New Jersey and comes of good, old English\r\nstock. He was born in Salem county, that State, November 21, 1845. His\r\nparents were John G. and Sarah Ann (Reeves) Ballinger, also natives of\r\nNew Jersey. His paternal grandfather was John G. Ballinger, who married\r\na Quaker woman and died when Thomas E. was but a boy. His mother was a\r\ndaughter of Stephen Reeves, a scion of an old eastern family and a\r\nleading shipbuilder of New Jersey. The Reeves family settled in Alloway\r\ntownship, Salem county, New Jersey. John G. Ballinger, the father, was\r\nborn in 1827, and died in 1906. He was a miller, and operated a mill\r\nduring the active years of his long life. His wife, Sarah Ann, died in\r\n1850, leaving three children: Stephen R., a miller, who resided in New\r\nJersey, and died October 15, 1915; Samuel E., a retired farmer, living\r\nin the suburbs of Atchison, and Thomas E., with whose career this review\r\nis directly concerned. John G. Ballinger married a second time, to Sarah\r\nAustin, who bore him the following children: John, Charles, Walter,\r\nEllen, Sadie, Emma and Minnie.\r\n\r\nThe elder Ballinger had both the means and the incentive to give his\r\nchildren an education. Accordingly, Thomas E. had the advantages of\r\nthorough schooling and, after attending the district school of his home\r\nneighborhood, he studied in the Cumberland County Academy at Bridgetown.\r\nN. J., the Crittendon School in Philadelphia and the Eastman Business\r\nCollege at Poughkeepsie, New York, completing his course in the latter\r\ninstitution in 1865. He then became a clerk in a grocery store at\r\nGlouster, N. J., and was later employed in a drug store. All the while,\r\nhowever, he was hearkening to the call of the West, which had reached\r\nthe ears of thousands of young men in the East. The call proved so\r\nstrong that in 1869 he made the long journey to Kansas to become one of\r\nthe pioneers of the new State. For the first two years he worked out as\r\na farm hand in Shannon township, Atchison county, saving his funds in\r\norder that he might begin farming for himself. In 1871 he made his first\r\npurchase of eighty acres of unimproved land in Lancaster township,\r\nAtchison county, at a cost of $15 per acre. On this tract he built a two\r\nroom house in which he lived for two years, and was there joined by his\r\nbrother, Samuel E. He then married, and the first five years of a happy\r\nwedded life were spent on this farm. He traded this farm for eighty\r\nacres of land in Shannon township, which served as the family home until\r\n1888. He then exchanged the Shannon township farm for 240 acres, near\r\nHuron, Atchison county, which he retained for two years, and then made\r\nhis last trade for 160 acres in the east central part of Lancaster\r\ntownship. For seventeen years, until his retirement to Atchison in 1907,\r\nthis fine farm was the family home. Mr. Ballinger greatly improved this\r\nfarm, added to it another forty acres, and with its two sets of\r\nbuildings and well kept fields, is one of the finest and most productive\r\nagricultural plants in the county.\r\n\r\nHe was married on Saturday, March 21, 1874, to Julia H. Holland, and to\r\nthis union have been born the following children: Ralph, a talented\r\nphysician of Chicago, married Flora Groom, of Indiana; Mrs. Marie\r\nShuffleberger, Doniphan county, Kansas, mother of three children,\r\nDorothy, Reeves and Wayne; Adel, at home; Grace, wife of J. W. Coleman,\r\nof Atchison, having two children, John Ballinger, born June 14, 1911,\r\nand James Henry, born November 3, 1915; Thomas Edward, Jr., on the home\r\nfarm, married Nellie Colgan and is the father of one child, John Edward;\r\nJulia Gladys resides at home with her parents. Father, mother and\r\ndaughters reside in a handsome brick residence, erected by Mr. Ballinger\r\nat 210 North Eleventh street. Mrs. Ballinger was born December 29, 1853,\r\nin England, and is a daughter of Joshua and Maria (Relph) Holland, who\r\nimmigrated to America in 1856, and first settled on an Illinois farm.\r\nThe family came to Kansas in 1860, settling in Nemaha county, going from\r\nthere to Ft. Leavenworth, where Joshua Holland followed his trade of\r\nstone mason. During the Civil war Mr. Holland served in the commissary\r\ndepartment at Ft. Leavenworth. In 1870 he came to Atchison county and\r\ncultivated a farm of 120 acres near Lane until his death. Mr. Holland\r\nwas born in April, 1822, and died in September, 1884. Mrs. Holland was\r\nborn in November, 1824, and died in April, 1894. They were the parents\r\nof the following children: Emma, deceased; Misses Mary and Harriet\r\nHolland on a farm near Lancaster; Mrs. Julia Ballinger, and William, a\r\nretired farmer in Lancaster.\r\n\r\nThomas E. Ballinger has always been a Republican in politics and took an\r\nactive part in political and civic affairs in his home township, serving\r\nas township clerk for a number of years. He was elected to the office of\r\ncounty commissioner in 1910, and served from January, 1911, to January,\r\n1915. While a member of the board of county commissioners the best\r\ninterests of the county were paramount with him, and he was an honest\r\nand capable public official. He and his family are members of the\r\nPresbyterian church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ROGER PATRICK SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of many of the prosperous and substantial families who are\r\nthe backbone and substance of the rural population in Atchison county\r\nare very similar, beginning far away, across the ocean, in one of the\r\nolder countries from whence the parents came to seek fortune in America.\r\nThe Sullivan family had its origin in Ireland and it was from the\r\nEmerald Isle that the father of the family came when twelve years of\r\nage, struggled from poverty to comparative wealth and left his sons well\r\nprovided for, as a reward for their filial devotion to the parents when\r\nold age came upon them. Roger Sullivan, a progressive farmer of Benton\r\ntownship, is one of the best known men in his section of the county. The\r\nSullivan home is an attractive one, and the home farm of Mr. Sullivan is\r\none of the most fertile and best kept in Atchison county.\r\n\r\nRoger Patrick Sullivan was born December 4, 1862, in Atchison, a son of\r\nMichael and Bridget (Tobin) Sullivan, natives of Ireland. Michael\r\nSullivan was born in 1826 and lived in his native land until he was\r\ntwelve years of age when he made his way to America. His travels while\r\nseeking fortune in the new country took him ever westward and he was\r\nmarried in Keokuk, Iowa, to Bridget Tobin, who was his faithful helpmate\r\nduring the years when he was rising from poverty to affluence. In 1860\r\nthey came to Atchison, Kan., where Mr. Sullivan engaged in railroad\r\ncontract work and assisted in the grading of the Central Branch\r\nrailroad. He made money in his railroad contract work and was enabled to\r\npurchase a farm in Grasshopper township, or rather traded for it. While\r\nliving in Atchison, with true Irish thrift, he and his wife managed to\r\nbecome owners of a home which they exchanged for eighty acres of land in\r\nGrasshopper township, upon which they moved and developed it into a fine\r\nfarm. Mr. Sullivan in the course of time bought an additional quarter\r\nsection and with the help of his sturdy sons he increased his acreage to\r\n320 acres of well improved farm land. When old age crept upon Michael\r\nand his wife they turned over the farms to their two sons, who cared for\r\nthem in their declining years, which were spent in peace and comfort.\r\nMr. Sullivan died at the home of his son. John Edward, December 24,\r\n1906, and his wife followed him to the great beyond two years later,\r\nFebruary, 1908. Three children were born to this worthy couple, namely:\r\nJohn Edward, a farmer residing in Grasshopper township; Roger Patrick,\r\nthe subject of this review, and Mary, deceased.\r\n\r\nRoger P. learned when a youth the art of cultivating the soil, and\r\ndiligently applied himself to the task of helping to build up the family\r\nestate, and received as his share of the farm lands owned by his father\r\na fine quarter section of land upon which he resided until his removal\r\nto his present location in the spring of 1908. Prosperity has smiled\r\nupon his efforts, and he is now the owner of 360 acres of land, 160\r\nacres of which are comprised in his home farm, eighty acres is located\r\nfive miles west of his home in Kapioma township, and he still retains\r\n120 acres of the original Sullivan farm, which is entirely devoted to\r\npasture. If one should ask Mr. Sullivan how he had managed to attain the\r\nconsiderable acreage which he now possesses, his answer would probably\r\nbe, “By hard work,” which would be true, but the reviewer is also of the\r\nopinion that the “hard work” was also supplemented by intelligent\r\neffort, self-denial at times, sobriety, and good financial judgment.\r\n\r\nMr. Sullivan was married January 11, 1892, to Miss Mary Linehan, who was\r\nborn in Atchison county, Kansas, in 1865, a daughter of James and\r\nKathryn Linehan, natives of Ireland, and who were pioneer settlers in\r\nAtchison county. To this union four children have been born, namely:\r\nCatharine, aged seventeen years, and a student in the Atchison County\r\nHigh School, class of ’17; Daniel, fifteen years old, a freshman in the\r\ncounty high school; Mary, aged twelve years, and Helen, aged nine,\r\npupils in the parochial school at Effingham.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party has always claimed the allegiance of Mr. Sullivan\r\nand his father before him was a Democrat. He and his family are members\r\nof the Catholic church which was the faith of their fathers. He finds\r\ntime to give attention to the social side of life, and is fraternally\r\naffiliated with the Knights of Columbus and the Benevolent and\r\nProtective Order of Elks, of Atchison. Mr. Sullivan is a thorough\r\nKansan, and is proud to be numbered among the real pioneers of Atchison\r\ncounty, and in his opinion there is no better spot than the county which\r\nhas always been his home.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN FLEMING.\r\n\r\nJohn Fleming, a successful merchant of Atchison, was born October 29,\r\n1864, in Holland. When four years old his parents left the land of their\r\nbirth and came to America in 1868. He was one of twins, the other twin\r\nbrother dying during the ocean voyage to America. His parents were\r\nLambert and Rosena (Johnson) Fleming, who set out from their native land\r\nimbued with the desire to better their condition in America and finally\r\nlocated in Atchison. The elder Fleming had been a skilled wooden-shoe\r\nmaker in his native land, and he plied his trade in Atchison, being able\r\nto market the product of his skilled workmanship through the kindly\r\nassistance of John Ratterman, who exchanged groceries and the\r\nnecessities of life for the shoes which Mr. Fleming made. The family\r\nfinally located on a farm south of Atchison, and resided there until the\r\ndeath of the father in 1882, at which time John, his mother and two\r\nsisters, Bertha, now widow of Henry Nass, deceased: Ida Van Benthen,\r\nresiding at Seventeenth and Atchison streets, removed to Atchison.\r\n\r\nJohn Fleming was four years old when his parents took up their residence\r\nin Atchison county, and he was reared on the farm, south of the city,\r\nattending the district schools, and was able to secure a limited\r\neducation in this manner. Upon coming to the city to reside he worked in\r\nvarious grocery stores for several years. With true thrift, for which\r\nthose of Holland birth are noted the world over, he carefully saved his\r\nmoney over and above actual living expenses, and in 1898, equipped with\r\na capital of $500, he started in business with this amount and some\r\nborrowed money. For over seventeen years he has been conducting a\r\ngrocery business at 321 North Seventh street and his business has been\r\nconstantly on the increase. The demands of his growing trade and the\r\nexpansion of his business became such that in 1907 it became necessary\r\nfor him to erect the modern brick buildings which now houses his\r\nexcellent stock of goods at 321 North Seventh street. It is one of the\r\nmost attractive and best kept establishments of the kind in the city,\r\nand is noted for the tasteful manner in which the goods of the very best\r\nquality are displayed and the unvarying courtesy with which the patrons\r\nare treated. Prosperity has come to Mr. Fleming, and in 1908 he invested\r\nhis surplus in the erection of a four-suite apartment house, each\r\napartment of which contains six rooms. He is also the owner of other\r\nreal estate in north Atchison, and is rated as one of the city’s\r\nenterprising and progressive business men.\r\n\r\nMr. Fleming was married in 1889 to Emma C. Hilligoss, a daughter of\r\nAlfred and Anna Eliza (McLain) Hilligoss, who located in Atchison when\r\nshe was twelve years of age. Seven children have been born to Mr. and\r\nMrs. Fleming, four living: William J., associated with his father in the\r\ngrocery business; Henry A., also his father’s assistant; Agnes R., John\r\nEdwin; Bertha died at the age of four years; Ruth died in infancy, and\r\nTheodore died at the age of four months.\r\n\r\nMr. Fleming is a member of St. Benedict’s Catholic Church, and is\r\nfraternally connected with the Modern Woodmen of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MARK H. HULINGS.\r\n\r\nFor an Atchison county man to start out in life with a capital of\r\nfifteen dollars, which was given to him by a loving mother, with the\r\ninjunction that he purchase an article for personal adornment, and then\r\nto invest said fifteen dollars in a span of mules, which became the\r\nnucleus to a fortune, and for this citizen to rise to the position of\r\nbeing one of the large landed proprietors of Kansas, sounds like a tale\r\nfrom modern fiction. But the tale is true, and the incident which marked\r\nthe starting point of the career of Mark H. Hulings, of Center township,\r\nis the keystone of the man’s character, and shows wherein lies the\r\nmaterial from which he was created. Mr. Hulings decided that a pair of\r\nmules would do him more material good than adorning his person, and\r\ntherein used rare and capable judgment. Mr. Hulings is a Kansas man, who\r\nduring a career in agricultural pursuits embracing but little more than\r\nthirty years, has achieved a success which is truly remarkable. Not\r\ncontent with just common every-day farming, as has been practiced with\r\nindifferent success by others, Mr. Hulings became a specialist and has\r\ntaken his rightful place among the many skilled cattle breeders of this\r\ncounty, who in time to come will receive the credit and honors which are\r\ntheirs by right. By industry, persistence, intelligence, and keen\r\nfinancial judgment he has risen to become one of the leading farmers of\r\nAtchison county and Kansas. Born in the old Buckeye State, of Virginia\r\nparents, he is a loyal and steadfast Kansan, and takes pride in the fact\r\nthat he is one of the real pioneers of this section of a great State.\r\n\r\nMark H. Hulings, farmer and stockman, of Center township, was born\r\nFebruary 14, 1862, at Walnut Hill, a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio. He is a\r\nson of Samuel and Louise (Brown) Hulings. They had four children, as\r\nfollows: Mrs. Lillie High, widow, Atchison, Kan.; Cincinnatus, deceased;\r\nMark, the subject of this sketch, and Ruth J., twins, the latter\r\ndeceased. The father was born in what is now West Virginia in 1832. He\r\nwas a baker by trade, and his early days were spent on a steamboat,\r\nwhere he was employed as a cook and baker. When a young man he came to\r\nCincinnati, where he worked for some time, and then he began farming. In\r\n1867 he came to Atchison county, Kansas, where he bought 160 acres of\r\nland, and built a seven-room house of brick, which was considered a fine\r\nresidence in that day. He was a successful farmer and his crops were\r\nalways good, with the exception of one year when they were destroyed by\r\nthe grasshoppers. The father conducted his farm until his death in 1898.\r\nThe mother was born in New York and died about 1905, aged about seventy\r\nyears. An accident in an Atchison hardware store elevator which injured\r\nher leg led to her death.\r\n\r\nMark Hulings attended the school in District No. 28, Center township,\r\nand later the Pardee Seminary. When he started out in life for himself\r\nhe had only fifteen dollars which his mother gave him to buy a ring for\r\nhimself. But caring little for personal jewelry, bought a span of mules\r\ninstead, for which he paid the fifteen dollars as the first payment.\r\nThis was his first investment, but it was a profitable one, and he has\r\ncontinued to invest until he is now an extensive land owner. He and his\r\nbrother, Cincinnatus, bought land of their own after their parents died,\r\nand farmed together about eight years when each bought a farm of his\r\nown. Mark bought land in Center township and now owns 810 acres, a large\r\npart of which is well improved. He was a breeder of registered Hereford\r\ncattle for a time, but now devotes his attention to Shorthorns. He has\r\nworked his way to the first rank of Atchison county farmers, and now\r\nholds land that makes him one of the largest land owners of the county.\r\nOn April 27, 1890, he married Emma Sharpless, who was born September 22,\r\n1871, in Delaware. (See sketch of U. B. Sharpless for a sketch of the\r\nSharpless family history.) To Mr. and Mrs. Hulings have been born two\r\nchildren: Mark S. and Susie E., living at home. Mr. Hulings is a\r\nRepublican. He and his wife and children are members of the Christian\r\nchurch at Farmington.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FRANK SUTTER.\r\n\r\nFrank Sutter, owner of “Highlington,” a splendid farm of 245 acres, in\r\nBenton township, Atchison county, located one-half mile west of\r\nEffingham, is a native of Atchison county, and is one of its most\r\nsuccessful and progressive farmers. A beautiful, modern farm home of\r\neight rooms occupies a rise of land fronting the main highway, running\r\neast and west from Effingham, and is fully equipped with a water system\r\nand private gas plant installed by Mr. Sutter. A large red barn stands\r\nin the rear of the home. This farm is operated as a dairying plant, and\r\nMr. Sutter maintains a herd of fifteen milch cows of the Jersey and\r\nShorthorn breeds.\r\n\r\nFrank Sutter was born January 8, 1871, on a pioneer farm in Walnut\r\ntownship, Atchison county, and is a son of Frederick Sutter, deceased,\r\nof whom a complete biography is written in this volume. Frank Sutter\r\ncame with the family to Benton township in 1880 and lived on the home\r\nplace, two miles west of Effingham, and after his father’s death he and\r\nhis brothers, Fred and William, became the owners of the section of land\r\nwhich has since been divided, Frank taking a quarter section as his\r\nshare when the division of land was made. The sons of Frederick Sutter\r\nfarmed the family estate in common until 1902, and, after various\r\nchanges following the division of the estate Frank became the proprietor\r\nof 245 acres in one tract, which he is now cultivating.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutter was married in 1909 to Mrs. Kate (Cook) Pitman, a widow, who\r\nis the mother of eight children by her first marriage, as follows:\r\nGeorge, now in Montana; Ralph, living in Iowa; Mrs. Elsie Mann, of\r\nNebraska; Mrs. Vera Blair, a resident of Effingham; Margaret, at home;\r\nMrs. Geneva Perdue, of Huron, Kan.; Helen and Thomas reside at home.\r\nMrs. Sutter was a daughter of E. F. Cook.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Sutter is a Republican in politics, he votes independently in\r\ncounty and local matters, and supports the candidate who seems best\r\nfitted for the office, in his judgment. He is a member of the Ancient\r\nFree and Accepted Masons, and the Ancient Order of United Workmen. Mr.\r\nSutter is of a high type of the successful farmer who has made good in\r\nhis inherited vocation. The success of each individual member of the\r\nSutter family is due, to a great extent, to their coöperation and\r\nability to work together for the common good of the whole family,\r\ncollectively and individually, while the family fortunes were in process\r\nof building.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BISHOP K. HAM.\r\n\r\nBishop K. Ham, one of the younger successful farmers and stockmen of\r\nGrasshopper township, Atchison county, is the last surviving\r\nrepresentative of one of the oldest pioneer families of the western part\r\nof the county. He resides on the old homestead of the Ham family,\r\nconsisting of 170 acres of land, upon which his father homesteaded in\r\n1861. B. K. Ham was born on this farm July 23, 1882, a son of Martin W.,\r\nand Margarette (Black) Ham, natives of Fleming county, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nMartin W. Ham was born near the town of Flemingsburg, Ky., April 13,\r\n1834, and was a son of George and Ruth Ham, also reared in Kentucky. The\r\ngrandfather of Martin W. was John or “Jackie,” a native of Greenbrier\r\ncounty, Virginia, and was of Scotch-Irish lineage. The Ham family is a\r\nvery old one in this country, and the great-grandfather of B. K. Ham was\r\nJohn, better known as “Jackie” Ham, who was one among the earliest\r\npioneer settlers of Kentucky. Martin W. was reared to young manhood in\r\nFleming county, Kentucky, and there married Jane Humphreys. In 1861 the\r\nHam family left Kentucky in search of a home in the West, making the\r\nlong trip overland to Missouri by wagon. After a short stay in Missouri\r\nthey came to Atchison county, Kansas, and settled on the farm now owned\r\nby Mrs. Margarette Ham. All of Martin W. Ham’s worldly possessions when\r\nhe landed in Kansas was his team and wagon and a few household\r\nnecessities. The land was wild and there were few settlers on the\r\nprairies in Grasshopper township, where he made his settlement and\r\neventually developed a fine farm. He became an extensive cattle and hog\r\nraiser and made considerable money in this manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Hon. Martin W. Ham_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Martin W. Ham_\r\n]\r\n\r\nMartin W. Ham was twice married, his first wife, Jane Humphreys Ham,\r\ndying May 18, 1879. He married his second wife, Margarette Black, June\r\n28, 1880. One son was born of this second marriage, Bishop K. Mrs.\r\nMargarette (Black) Ham was born March 29, 1854, a daughter of M. M. and\r\nRebecca (Simms) Black, the former a native of Virginia, and of Irish\r\nlineage. He was one of the early pioneer settlers of Kansas. Martin W.\r\nHam died in 1908. From the start of his career in Kansas M. W. Ham took\r\nan active and influential part in civic and political affairs of his\r\ncounty and State. During the border ruffian days he was active in\r\naffairs and was a Free State man. He was captain of Company G, Kansas\r\nHome Guards, during the Civil war. He held various township offices and\r\nwas elected a member of the Kansas State legislature in 1869, serving\r\none term. He was a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, and was\r\naffiliated with the Masonic and Odd Fellows lodges.\r\n\r\nBishop K. Ham, with whom this review is directly concerned, received his\r\neducation in the district school of his neighborhood and also studied in\r\nthe college at Hiawatha, Kan., for one year. He then took up farming,\r\nand after his marriage lived on a neighboring farm until his father’s\r\ndemise. He then came to the home farm which he has since been\r\ncultivating with considerable success. Mr. Ham has made a record as a\r\nbreeder of horses and mules second to none in Atchison county. He is the\r\nowner of a magnificent, imported black stallion, “Illico,” six years\r\nold, which he purchased from the well known importer, Charles Kirk, of\r\nSt. Joseph, Mo. He is the owner of a high class jack and is a successful\r\nbreeder of mules. The pride of his farm is his fine herd of thirty\r\nthoroughbred Jerseys, headed by the pedigreed bull “Loren’s Lad,” both\r\nthe sire and dam of which were imported. By means of holding annual\r\nsales Mr. Ham will dispose of the surplus stock of his herds of cattle\r\nand horses. The Ham farm is well improved in every way with good\r\ncommodious buildings, silo, etc., a fine modern home, all grouped\r\ntogether on a beautiful location.\r\n\r\nMr. Ham was married October 19, 1905, to Miss Carrie B. McCubbins, and\r\nto this union has been born: Marguerite Ham, born April 17, 1907. Mrs.\r\nCarrie B. Ham is a daughter of Robert D. and Elizabeth (Tenry)\r\nMcCubbins, who were early settlers in Atchison county. The McCubbins\r\nfamily first settled near the city of Atchison, and later came to\r\nGrasshopper township.\r\n\r\nMr. Ham is a Republican in politics, and is a member of the Ancient Free\r\nand Accepted Masons of Muscotah, the Modern Woodmen of America and the\r\nFraternal Aid societies. He is one of the best known and rising young\r\nagriculturists of the county and will undoubtedly make a name for\r\nhimself among the breeders of the State of Kansas and middle West.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHARLES H. LINLEY.\r\n\r\nCharles H. Linley, a prominent physician and surgeon, of Atchison, may\r\nvery appropriately be called the dean of the Atchison county medical\r\nprofession. Dr. Linley is a Kentuckian. He was born in Livingston\r\ncounty, Kentucky, June 19, 1847, and is a son of Dr. Thomas and Maria\r\n(Barker) Linley, natives of Lewis county, Kentucky. Maria Barker, the\r\nmother, was a daughter of Admiral Barker of the United States navy. Dr.\r\nThomas Linley, the father, was born in 1806. He was a son of Thomas\r\nLinley, a native of England, who settled in Virginia at an early date\r\nand later removed to Kentucky, and was a pioneer of this State. Thomas\r\nLinley, the father of Dr. Charles H. Linley, was a large plantation\r\nowner and owned many slaves in Kentucky prior to the Civil war, but was\r\na strong Union man and believed that slavery was wrong, and when the\r\nCivil war came on he was pronounced in his anti-slavery views, and\r\nnotwithstanding the position of many of his neighbors and friends and\r\nlife-long associates, he stood firmly by the Union. He was a graduate of\r\nthe old Transylvania Medical College, at Lexington, Ky. He began the\r\npractice of his profession at the early age of nineteen years, and for\r\nforty-five years practiced most of the time in the vicinity of Salem,\r\nKy. He came to Atchison, Kan., in 1866, but remained a short time, when\r\nhe returned to Kentucky, where he died March 31, 1880. Dr. Thomas and\r\nMaria (Barker) Linley were the parents of thirteen children, three of\r\nwhom died in infancy, and four are now living, as follows: Dr. Charles\r\nH., the subject of this sketch; Isaac resides on the old homestead in\r\nSalem, Ky.; Mrs. Laura Hill resides at Liberty, Mo., and Joseph W., now\r\nliving retired in Atchison, Kan. After receiving a good academic and\r\nclassical education, Dr. Charles H. Linley entered Miami Medical\r\nCollege, now known as the Ohio Medical College, at Cincinnati, and was\r\ngraduated from that institution in 1877 with the degree of Doctor of\r\nMedicine. In 1880 he located in the city of Atchison where he has\r\npracticed his profession with uniform success for the past thirty-five\r\nyears. He is one of the oldest physicians in the number of years in\r\npractice in Atchison.\r\n\r\nDr. Linley was married in 1879 to Miss Fannie W. Gregory, a native of\r\nKentucky. She was born in 1854 and is a daughter of James Gregory and a\r\nmember of a prominent Kentucky family. Her father died when Mrs. Linley\r\nwas fourteen years of age. Dr. and Mrs. Linley are the parents of the\r\nfollowing children: Maria, born in 1880, and died in 1909; Corinne, a\r\nteacher in the Atchison high school, and a graduate of Midland College\r\nand the State Normal school at Emporia; Ray G., traveling salesman for\r\nBlish, Mize & Silliman; Nora B., a graduate of Midland College, now a\r\nteacher in Colorado; Alice, a graduate of Midland College, now a teacher\r\nin the grades at Atchison, and Louis D., traveling salesman for Blish,\r\nMize & Silliman.\r\n\r\nDr. Linley is a Democrat and has taken an active part in the welfare of\r\nhis city and county. He has served as city health officer for several\r\nterms and was police commissioner for Atchison for one year. He served\r\non the board of United States pension examiners for eight years during\r\nCleveland’s administrations. He is a member of the Knights of the\r\nMaccabees, the Fraternal Aid, and the Foresters of America. The Linley\r\nfamily are members of the Christian church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            L. C. ARENSBERG.\r\n\r\nL. C. Arensberg, one of the younger business men of Atchison, and member\r\nof the enterprising and successful firm of Babcock & Arensberg, shoe\r\nmerchants, is a Hollander by birth, and a hustling American in every\r\nsense the word implies. It has long been a matter of note that the\r\nnatives of Holland who became American citizens are more apt and take\r\nmore kindly and quickly to the ways of this nation than the people of\r\nany other European country. This country seems to become their natural\r\nhabitat, and they become citizens in both deed and word after a few\r\nyears’ residence here. Mr. Arensberg was born in Holland, September 17,\r\n1880, and is a son of William and Alegunde (Muskens) Arensberg, who\r\nimmigrated to this country in 1885, actuated by a desire to locate in a\r\nland where their children would have more and better opportunities for\r\nsuccess than their own little, crowded, native country afforded. They\r\nbelieved rightly and were successful in establishing a home in Atchison\r\nwhere they had relatives who had preceded them to the newer country. The\r\nArensberg family established themselves in reasonably comfortable\r\ncircumstances in Atchison in a short time. There were nine children in\r\nthe family of William and Alegunde Arensberg.\r\n\r\nL. C. Arensberg was educated in the parochial and high schools of\r\nAtchison. Then he obtained a position as all round man in Bradley &\r\nOstertag’s shoe store. Here he was employed for ten years and thoroughly\r\nlearned the ins and outs of the shoe business, becoming a very\r\nproficient salesman. In the meantime he carefully saved his money, with\r\na view to eventually engaging in business for himself. His ambition was\r\nat last realized, and in 1906 he purchased an interest in the Babcock &\r\nStallons shoe store, buying out the interest of Mr. Stallons. He is a\r\nfull partner in the business and has won a place of merit and honor\r\namong the leading merchants of Atchison.\r\n\r\nPolitically, Mr. Arensberg is a Democrat, and is inclined to be liberal\r\nin his views and independent in his voting. He is a member of the\r\nKnights of Columbus and the Loyal Order of Moose, and is a member of St.\r\nBenedict’s Catholic Church. He is active in the affairs of the Atchison\r\nCommercial Club, and is recognized as one of the real “live wires” of\r\nthe business and civic life of his home city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             W. B. COLLETT.\r\n\r\nW. B. Collett, district agent for the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance\r\nCompany of Milwaukee, Wis., is one of the progressive business men of\r\nAtchison. He was born in Liverpool, England, in 1860, and is a son of\r\nJohn and Mary (Henston) Collett, the former a native of Wolverhampton,\r\nStaffordshire, England, and the latter of Tipperary, Ireland. John\r\nCollett was a prosperous importing provision merchant when the Civil war\r\nbroke out in this country. The importing business fell off to such an\r\nextent in European ports that business was injured to such an extent\r\nthat he failed, and came to the United States, and in 1862 sent for his\r\nfamily, consisting of his wife and three children. During his youth he\r\nserved a seven-year apprenticeship in the provision trade. In 1879 he\r\ncame to Atchison as head salesman for the Fowler Brothers Packing\r\nCompany, and remained with that company until 1883. He then went with\r\nthe Armour Packing Company, of Kansas City, in the same capacity, and\r\nwas with that company for fourteen years, when he was made manager of\r\ntheir branch at St. Paul, Minn., and later he was the European\r\nrepresentative for Jacob Dold Packing Company, of Buffalo, N. Y. In 1908\r\nhe retired from active business and took up his residence on a farm near\r\nRichards, Mo., where he died, in 1911, at the age of seventy-nine years.\r\nHis wife survives him and resides on the farm where he died.\r\n\r\nJohn Collett was a man of unusual ability, and had few equals as a\r\nsalesman. He was a capable executive and thoroughly understood handling\r\nlarge commercial enterprises. He was a master salesman and always\r\ncommanded a large salary. He was a money maker, although he died\r\npossessed of but a small amount of this world’s goods; he was a money\r\nmaker rather than a hoarder of dimes.\r\n\r\nW. B. Collett, whose name introduces this sketch, was educated in the\r\npublic schools, and when a young man went to work in the Elgin watch\r\nworks, at Elgin, Ill., and in 1879, when the family came to Kansas, he\r\nwent to work for the Fowler Brothers Packing Company, where he remained\r\nabout a year. He then entered the employ of Bowman & Kellogg, millers,\r\nas bookkeeper, and later became a buyer and salesman for that company.\r\nIn 1888 he engaged in the general insurance business, and three years\r\nlater entered the employ of the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance\r\nCompany, and has been with that company ever since with headquarters at\r\nAtchison. Mr. Collett was married in December, 1886, to Miss Annie\r\nHeermance, who came to Atchison with her mother in 1883 from Hudson, N.\r\nY. She was one of the old Holland families of New York and taught in the\r\nAtchison High School prior to her marriage.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Collett have two children as follows; Mary E., educated at\r\nWellesley College, took her master degree at the University of\r\nPennsylvania, then one year of post-graduate work at Brown University,\r\nat Providence, R. I., when she became instructor of biology at the\r\nCarnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, Pa., and W. B., Jr., who was educated in\r\nthe Atchison public schools. Culver Military Academy, Culver, Ind., and\r\nthe State Agriculture College at Manhattan, Kan.\r\n\r\nMr. Collett is an Episcopalian, a York Rite Mason and a member of the\r\nYoung Men’s Christian Association, and has been active in the work of\r\nthese organizations for years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JAMES DOOLEY.\r\n\r\nThe late James Dooley, of Shannon township, left behind him a life’s\r\nrecord that is well worth recounting, and deserved an honored place in\r\nthe memoirs of the county, in which he was for over forty years a\r\nprominent and well known figure. As a pioneer he did his part well in\r\nbuilding up Atchison county. The story of his life is romantic in many\r\nways, and he was always imbued with the idea of providing well for his\r\nbeloved family, and leaving his affairs in such a stable condition that\r\nhis descendants could earn on the great work which the father and\r\nfounder of the family had so well begun and brought to such a\r\nsubstantial culmination.\r\n\r\nJames Dooley, deceased, was born January 6, 1835, in Ireland, a son of\r\nIrish parents, James and Catharine Dooley, who left their native land in\r\n1847, and located in Canada, where the father, James Dooley, the elder,\r\nbecame ill and died in the city of Hamilton. Although the young Irish\r\nlad was but twelve years of age and immature, it was necessary for him\r\nto go to work and gain a livelihood the best way he could. He managed to\r\nget a job which paid him one dollar and a half per month with his board.\r\nHe was knocked about from pillar to post while a youth, and managed to\r\nmake his way. His adventures in making a struggle for an honest\r\nlivelihood were similar to those of other poor orphan boys left in a\r\nstrange land without friends or relatives, other than those who were as\r\npoor as himself. One bright rift in the lonely life of this orphan boy\r\nis to be noticed when he became a boarder in the Hurley home at\r\nHarrisburg, Canada. It was here that he met with a genuine kindness and\r\nformed an attachment for the noble-hearted girl who later became his\r\ninspiration, and was his faithful wife during the years in Kansas when\r\nhe was working his way upward to wealth and affluence, aided and abetted\r\nby her wise counsel and assistance. Imbued with a desire to secure\r\ncapital so that he could come to this new country and realize an\r\ninherent ambition to own a farm, he set out for the gold fields of\r\nColorado during the Civil war years, and there amassed a small fortune\r\nof $500 in gold, saved during the months of his hard and unremitting\r\nlabor in the gold mines of the western State. With this capital he felt\r\nable to make the venture which he and his sweetheart had planned, and,\r\naccordingly, after his marriage at Paris, Canada, with Catharine Hurley,\r\nhe and his wife set out for Atchison in March of 1866. During the first\r\nfew months of their residence in Atchison county they lived with a\r\nsister of Mr. Dooley, Mrs. Slattery, in Shannon township, and James\r\nworked in the city at any honest labor he could get. Their first\r\ninvestment was for eighty acres of school land in Shannon township, for\r\nwhich they paid cash, and it then became necessary for Mr. Dooley to\r\nborrow forty dollars in order to get the deed for the land. During the\r\nwhole course of Mr. Dooley’s career in Atchison county, while the modest\r\neighty acres were growing to the large total of 600 acres of some of the\r\nbest agricultural land in the county, they never undertook a debt, but\r\neach time an additional tract of farm land was purchased, the savings\r\nwere drawn upon and cash paid for the land. Each of three sons now has a\r\nfine farm of 200 acres. The home place upon which Mrs. Dooley now\r\nresides, which consists of 200 acres, cost an even $10,000. This farm is\r\none of the oldest in the county and was originally preëmpted by a Mr.\r\nCollins, who set out a large grove of forty acres or more in walnut and\r\ncottonwood trees which have become very valuable, having grown to\r\nconsiderable size.\r\n\r\nCatharine (Hurley) Dooley, widow of James Dooley, was born April 28,\r\n1847, in Ireland, a daughter of James and Bridget Hurley, who left their\r\nnative land in 1847 while Katharine was but an infant, and located in\r\nHamilton, Canada, later residing in Harrisburg, Canada. A brother of\r\nMrs. Dooley, James Hurley, served three years and three months in the\r\nUnion army. He was a member of a Pennsylvania reserve regiment of\r\nsharpshooters and was wounded during the battle of Richmond, Va. For six\r\nmonths, while the wound in his wrist was healing, he served as sergeant\r\nin the quartermaster’s department. Some years after the war he became an\r\ninmate of the National Soldiers’ Home at Dayton, Ohio, and lost his life\r\nwhile aboard an excursion boat which sank in Lake Michigan, near\r\nChicago. Mr. and Mrs. Dooley were the parents of fourteen children: Mrs.\r\nJames Baker, Huron, Kan., and mother of eight children, Celia Baker, a\r\ntrained nurse in Chicago, Mary, wife of George Perdue, Joseph, William,\r\nBertha, Ruth, Rita and James; Catharine, James and Mary, deceased;\r\nSister Lucy, of Mt. St. Scholastica Academy; Lucy, wife of David\r\nLawless, and mother of two sons, Harold and Clevett; Mrs. Celia\r\nFinnegan, wife of Thomas Finnegan, of Houston, Texas, who had two\r\nchildren, Thomas Lillis and Mary; Bertha, Sister Dorothy, of the Order\r\nof St. Benedict’s in Mt. St. Scholastica Academy; Nora, wife of Roger\r\nFinnegan; William, managing the home farm; John, deceased; James married\r\nBertha Kistler, and has three children: Florence, Bernice, and Francis;\r\nEdward married Henrietta Kramer, and has two children, John and Gerard;\r\nJoseph, deceased; Irene, at home with her mother.\r\n\r\nIt is well to add here that James Dooley was one of the notable army of\r\nhardy freighters who crossed the plains with the long mule trains in the\r\nlate sixties. This was in April of 1866, when he convoyed a train load\r\nof goods to Denver, Colo., in company with William Slattery. During his\r\nwhole life, after attaining his majority, Mr. Dooley was a stanch\r\nDemocrat and was ever loyal to Democratic principles. While a member of\r\nthe Catholic church, he was a liberal supporter of all denominations,\r\nand took a broad and tolerant view of all religious matters as becoming\r\na widely traveled and experienced man. His life-long wish to perpetuate\r\nhis name and keep the family estate in the family was expressed while\r\nlying on his death bed. Calling his faithful helpmeet to his bedside, he\r\nsaid: “Mother, I am leaving you without having my dearest wish come\r\ntrue.” On being asked what it was, he said: “I have always longed for\r\nthe time to come when I could see my sons settled on this farm of ours,\r\nwith a Dooley here with his family, a Dooley there, and another son on\r\nthat part of the farm.” He was at once assured by his wife that his\r\nwishes would be respected, and after his demise Mrs. Dooley at once took\r\nsteps to carry out the plans of her husband with the result that within\r\nsight of her home the other two sons are comfortably located on 200\r\nacres of land each and have attractive homes of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ABRAHAM HOOPER.\r\n\r\nAbraham Hooper, deceased, was one of the pioneer settlers of Atchison\r\ncounty. He was one of the well known and sturdy figures in the early\r\ndays of the settlement of Kansas when strong and brave men were\r\nrequired, who were able to face the vicissitudes and hardships incident\r\nto the settlement of a new country and perform their tasks without\r\nsuccumbing, as weaker mortals were wont to do. Mr. Hooper was born in\r\nPlatte county, Missouri, November 23, 1839, on a farm, near Parkville.\r\nHis father was Abraham Hooper, a native of Tennessee and early settler\r\nof Missouri, who died in Mexico. Abraham Hooper, the subject of this\r\nreview, was reared in Platte county and came to Atchison county in 1858,\r\nsettling on a farm near Pardee. While engaged in farming he followed his\r\ntrade of plasterer in the neighborhood of Pardee. For a distance of ten\r\nmiles around his own residence he plastered all of the houses then\r\nbuilding by the incoming settlers. During the Civil war he was enrolled\r\nin the State militia. In his younger days Mr. Hooper was a freighter and\r\ncrossed the plains in charge of great trains on three different\r\noccasions. On one of his trips to Colorado he was placed in charge of a\r\ntrain load of twenty-five wagons, and one of his other trips was to Ft.\r\nUnion, N. M. His affiliations were with the Christian church, the\r\nAncient Order of United Workmen and the Knights of Pythias lodges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Daniel E. Hooper_\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Hooper was married in 1863 to Louisa Campbell, born in Tennessee in\r\n1842, a daughter of Daniel and Nancy Campbell. The Campbell family left\r\nTennessee in 1854, and in 1855 removed to a farm which they preëmpted\r\nnear Farmington in Atchison county. This was in a day when things were\r\nin a primitive state in Kansas. The Campbells lived in a cabin which was\r\none of the first dwellings built in that section of the county. The\r\nmother of Mrs. Hooper lived and died on their farm, and her father died\r\non the western plains while on a trip to the Black Hills. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nHooper removed from the farm to Atchison in 1887, and here Mr. Hooper\r\ndied February 18, 1914, at the advanced age of seventy-four years,\r\nhaving been born November 3, 1839. Three children were born to this well\r\nrespected couple: Addie B. died at the age of six years; Daniel,\r\ndeceased, and Nellie died at the age of one year. Mrs. Hooper lives all\r\nalone in her home, but remembers fondly the days of old and has many\r\nsweet memories of her husband and children to solace and comfort her\r\nduring her declining years. Despite her age she is physically and\r\nmentally vigorous and is distinguished in being one of the oldest\r\npioneer women now living in the county.\r\n\r\nHer well beloved son, Daniel Hooper, was born in 1868, and died January\r\n22, 1912. He was one of the most talented and best liked men in\r\nAtchison, and was far on the road to fame and prosperity when he was cut\r\noff in the prime of his vigorous and virile manhood. He received the\r\nrudiments of an elementary education in the district school near his\r\ncountry home and early developed ambitions which were partly realized\r\nduring his life. After leaving school he studied shorthand and\r\ntypewriting, and while holding a position in the law office of C. D.\r\nWalker he studied law and was admitted to the bar. A winning personality\r\nand his pronounced ability won him clients from the start of his legal\r\ncareer. His personal popularity and ambitious tendencies led him to\r\nenter politics, and he was elected to the office of probate judge of the\r\ncounty, serving the people well and faithfully for a period of six\r\nyears, and then served two terms as city attorney. Just in the prime of\r\nhis manhood and at the zenith of a career his health failed, and he died\r\nat Excelsior Springs, Mo., where he had gone in the hope of regaining\r\nhis health. Judge Hooper was sincerely mourned by a large circle of\r\nfriends and acquaintances and it is probable that there was not a man in\r\nhis class better liked or more highly respected in Atchison county at\r\nthe time of his demise. He was a Republican in politics and was\r\nfraternally connected with the Modern Woodmen, the Knights of Pythias,\r\nin whose councils he was very prominent, and an attendant at the\r\nChristian church. The most notable trait in Judge Hooper’s character was\r\nhis sincere devotion to his parents. Because of the love he bore his\r\nmother he never married and cared for no woman but her. His constant\r\nthought was to make provision for her in the event of his own demise,\r\nand he carefully looked after her immediate and future wants. Such men\r\nas he are deserving of a greater tribute than that embodied in this\r\nbrief review. A memorial window with his and the name of his father\r\nthereon was placed in the Christian church in his memory. Printed on\r\nthis window are Judge Hooper’s words of faith often expressed: “I\r\nbelieve in a great and a good God.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooper is rearing and educating a girl, Ruth Jones, who serves as\r\ncompany for her in the home.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ALBERT J. SMITH.\r\n\r\nAlbert J. Smith, the efficient cashier of the State Bank of Lancaster,\r\nKan., is a native son of Kansas, and has grown up with Atchison county.\r\nHe is a son of one of the prominent early pioneer settlers of the\r\ncounty, and while yet, comparatively, a young man, he has made good at\r\nhis chosen avocation and is considered one of the really successful\r\nbanking men of this section of the State, his talents and ability\r\nseeming to be especially adapted to the profession of banking.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith was born on a farm in Brown county, Kansas, January 13, 1879,\r\na son of Thomas B. and Mary E. (Woodruff) Smith. The father of Albert J.\r\nSmith was born August 16, 1843, in Grant county, Indiana, a son of\r\nWilliam J. and Lucinda (Barkley) Smith, who were born and reared in\r\nPennsylvania. The father of Lucinda Barkley Smith was a soldier in the\r\nWar of 1812. William J. Smith removed with his family to Grant county,\r\nIndiana, and in 1851 migrated further westward to Bureau county,\r\nIllinois, where he made a permanent settlement, and died in that county\r\nin 1869. Lucinda (Barkley) Smith died in Illinois in 1862, at the age of\r\nsixty-two years. They were the parents of the following children: Mrs.\r\nMargaret Pugh; Alvah, a veteran of the Civil war; Mrs. Lucinda Spangler;\r\nIsaac, Joseph, and William R. Thomas B. Smith, the father of Albert J.,\r\nwas eight years old when the family removed to Bureau county, Illinois,\r\nwhere he spent his boyhood days and received a common school education,\r\nfinishing in the Dover (Illinois) Academy. On the second call for\r\nvolunteers issued by President Lincoln, he enlisted in Company B,\r\nNinety-third regiment, Illinois infantry. He took part in a number of\r\ndecisive and important battles and campaigns. Among them are, Jackson,\r\nMiss., and Dalton, Ga. On May 16, 1863, while serving in General\r\nMcPherson’s corps, he fought at the battle of Champion Hill and was\r\nseverely wounded in the left shoulder. He was forced to remain in the\r\nhospital for some time and after his recovery he was placed on guard\r\nduty for the purpose of guarding the railroad bridges. At the close of\r\nthe war he was honorably discharged and returned to his home in Bureau\r\ncounty, Illinois. After his marriage in 1866, he continued to farm in\r\nIllinois until 1874, when he removed to Kansas, locating first in Brown\r\ncounty, where he and his family lived for six years, and then came to\r\nAtchison county, where Mr. Smith purchased a farm of 160 acres in\r\nGrasshopper township, northeast of the town of Muscotah. He resided on\r\nthis farm for twenty years and then moved to Effingham in 1900. He died\r\nin Effingham, November 29, 1914. Mrs. Mary E. (Woodruff) Smith, his\r\nwife, was a native of New Jersey, and a daughter of Nathan and Delia\r\nWoodruff.\r\n\r\nThomas B. Smith was married January 24, 1866, to Mary E. Woodruff, at\r\nPrinceton, Ill. They were the parents of nine children, six of whom are\r\nliving: Mrs. M. E. Beven, of Muscotah. Kan.; Mrs. H. T. Reece, of\r\nMuscotah; Mrs. J. C. Harman, of Auburn, Neb.; Albert J., the subject of\r\nthis review; C. E., cashier of the Huron Bank, and T. B., of the\r\nExchange National Bank of Atchison. Three daughters are deceased:\r\nLettie, Gracie and Goldie. Mr. Smith was an enterprising and progressive\r\ncitizen who did his duty in whatever community he was located, during\r\nhis long and useful life. While a resident of Grasshopper township he\r\nserved as township trustee for four years. He was a member of the city\r\ncouncil of Effingham one term, and filled the office of mayor for one\r\nterm, and also proved his efficiency as a member of the Atchison County\r\nHigh School board for two terms. He was an honored member of the\r\nIndependent Order of Odd Fellows, Ancient Order of United Workmen and\r\nthe Grand Army of the Republic, at Effingham. He was a stockholder and\r\ndirector of the banks at Lancaster and Huron, Kan. Mr. Smith was a\r\nmember of the Presbyterian church for over fifty years. Mrs. Smith, the\r\nwidowed mother, was born in New Jersey, in November, 1845, and now\r\nresides in Atchison.\r\n\r\nAlbert J. Smith was reared on the farm of his father and attended the\r\ndistrict school in District No. 23, Grasshopper township, and later\r\nentered the Atchison County High School, Effingham, and was graduated in\r\n1897. After his graduation he taught school in his home district for two\r\nterms, and in 1900 he received an appointment as clerk in the census\r\nbureau at Washington, D. C., and served for two years in that capacity.\r\nHe then returned to Effingham and entered the State Bank of Effingham,\r\nas assistant cashier and bookkeeper. He made a fine record for himself\r\nin this bank and in July, 1905, was one of the organizers of the Farmers\r\nand Merchants State Bank of Effingham, and held the office of cashier\r\nfrom the time of its opening until 1909, when he resigned his position\r\nand removed to Lancaster, where he became cashier of the Lancaster State\r\nBank. Mr. Smith, in addition to his banking interests, is the owner of\r\neighty acres of good land in Kapioma township, Atchison county.\r\n\r\nAlbert J. Smith was married in 1899 to Elizabeth R. Smith, and to this\r\nunion have been born the following children: Dorothy, deceased; Gladys,\r\nElizabeth and Albert, all living at home. Mrs. Elizabeth (Smith) Smith,\r\nwas born on a farm in Grasshopper township, February 26, 1879, and, like\r\nher husband, is a graduate of the Atchison County High School. She also\r\ntaught school for two years. She is a daughter of James K. and Elizabeth\r\n(Asquith) Smith, the former a native of Pennsylvania, and the mother a\r\nnative of England, and early settlers of Atchison county. Both are now\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith has identified himself with the civic affairs of Lancaster and\r\nis recognized as one of the town’s leading and enterprising citizens. He\r\nis a Republican and has served four years, from 1911 to 1915, inclusive,\r\nas mayor of Lancaster. His administration was successful and the affairs\r\nof the city were conducted with efficiency. He is a regular attendant of\r\nthe Presbyterian church, and is affiliated with the Anti-Horse Thief\r\nAssociation, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Modern Woodmen of\r\nAmerica, and the Knights and Ladies of Security.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOHN E. DUNCAN.\r\n\r\nThere is a proverbial saying that opportunity knocks once at every man’s\r\ndoor, and a classic has been written by a great Kansas statesman, since\r\ndeparted from among us, which tells in musical language that Kansas\r\nspells opportunity for the young man. Opportunity presented itself to\r\nJohn E. Duncan, Missouri Pacific agent, at Shannon, Kan., and Mr. Duncan\r\nseized it, and held on for all he was worth, and made a success of his\r\nventure. His ambition first was to become a railroad man and telegraph\r\noperator, and probably in the early stages of his career the post of\r\ntelegraph operator seemed to him to be the great height of attainment.\r\nHe realized his first dream, and when he came to Shannon, Kan., to take\r\ncharge of the Missouri Pacific business at that place, he conceived the\r\nidea of engaging in the buying and shipping of grain. This idea grew and\r\nhe became a grain buyer and shipper, built an elevator, established a\r\ngeneral store, opened an implement establishment, and became a\r\nprosperous and trusted business man of his adopted county. It is a fact\r\nthat more grain is shipped from the little village of Shannon through\r\nthe agency of Mr. Duncan than any other point in Atchison county,\r\noutside of the city of Atchison. Mr. Duncan enjoys the respect, esteem\r\nand confidence of the prosperous farmers of the section tributary to\r\nShannon, and they trade with him because of this confidence in his\r\nsquareness. A few years ago, when real hard times struck Kansas as a\r\nresult of the droughts, Mr. Duncan showed his hearty good will and\r\nconfidence in the eventual betterment of conditions by placing his trust\r\nin his farmer friends, and supplying such of those who were not blessed\r\nwith ready cash, with credit for supplies at his store, and carried them\r\nuntil they were able to pay. This kindness has been appreciated, and the\r\nmost cordial relations exist between Mr. Duncan and his patrons.\r\n\r\nJohn E. Duncan was born March 21, 1863, in Moro, Madison county,\r\nIllinois. He is a son of John and Mary (Hooley) Duncan, who had eight\r\nchildren, three of whom are now dead. The father was born in December,\r\n1818, in Ireland. He left his native land in 1846 and sailed for New\r\nYork. He engaged in farming in New York State, and was married two years\r\nlater. In 1851 he came to Illinois and remained there until 1891. The\r\nmother of John Duncan was born in Ireland, also, in 1827. In 1848 she\r\nleft there with a brother, William, and came to America. She died in\r\n1907. Both parents were members of the Catholic church. The subject of\r\nthis sketch was reared on the farm of his father and attended the\r\ngrammar schools of Madison county, Illinois. When he grew to be a young\r\nman the long days of labor on the farm palled on him and he longed to\r\nget into different work. He had always had an ambition to become a\r\ntelegrapher and when he was twenty-one years old he had a chance to\r\nlearn that work. He worked as telegrapher for the Chicago & Alton\r\nRailroad Company until 1887, when he went to Everest, Brown county,\r\nKansas, to become night operator for the Missouri Pacific Railroad\r\nCompany. In the fall of 1887 he was sent by the same company to Shannon,\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, to become the agent for the Missouri Pacific\r\nthere. In 1892 he went into the grain business. He bought and sold grain\r\nfor eight years, and at the end of a successful business period he\r\nerected the grain elevator at Shannon. This proved a profitable\r\ninvestment, and in 1907 he invested in a general merchandise store which\r\nhe conducted until August, 1915, when his store building and stock were\r\ndestroyed by fire, which was caused by lightning. Mr. Duncan has\r\nrecently completed a handsome new store building of cement blocks, 36×56\r\nfeet in size, which is attractively finished throughout and is well\r\nstocked with goods. In the fall of 1915 Mr. Duncan installed a line of\r\nagricultural implements and is the real merchant prince of his section\r\nof the county. Besides his business interests he is the owner of 200\r\nacres of land in Macoupin county, Illinois, a nice residence in Shannon,\r\nand several town lots.\r\n\r\nMr. Duncan was married in 1890 to Margaret V. Clark, and to this union\r\nthe following children have been born: John, associated with his father\r\nin business; Kathrine, aged sixteen years; Margaret, eleven years old;\r\nBernadette, aged nine; and Dorothy, four years of age, all of whom are\r\nliving at home with their parents. Mrs. Duncan is a daughter of Mathias\r\nand Katherine (O’Grady) Clark, both of whom were born and reared in\r\nIreland, and emigrated from their native land to America. She was\r\ngraduated from the school of telegraphy at St. Louis, Mo., in 1889, and\r\nassisted her husband in his work at Shannon. Mr. Duncan is a Democrat\r\nand he and his family are members of the Catholic church. He is a member\r\nof the Knights of Columbus, of Atchison, Kan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM SCHAPP.\r\n\r\nWilliam Schapp, a Civil war veteran and an Atchison county pioneer, is a\r\nnative of Germany. He was born in Wyler, Germany, January 26, 1840, and\r\nis a son of Peter and Margaret (Bonns) Schapp. The Schapp family\r\nimmigrated to America in 1854, landing at New Orleans, La. They remained\r\nthere but a short time, however, when they came up the Mississippi and\r\nMissouri rivers by boat and located at Weston, Platte county, Missouri,\r\nwhere a brother of Mrs. Schapp had located some time previously. Here\r\nthe father entered the dairy business and prospered and the parents\r\nmoved to Atchison, Kan., in 1868 and died in Atchison.\r\n\r\nWilliam Schapp received a common school education and grew to manhood in\r\nPlatte county. He entered the employ of James Steele, an extensive land\r\nowner, as overseer of his estate, and was thus employed when the Civil\r\nwar broke out and soon after the beginning of hostilities, Mr. Schapp\r\nwas drafted into the Confederate service. Four days after he became a\r\nConfederate soldier, his company was encamped on the banks of the\r\nMissouri river near Iatam, Mo. Young Schapp began to lay plans to\r\nescape, as he was a Union man at heart, and he had made up his mind that\r\nif he was going to serve in the army that he would serve under the stars\r\nand stripes. On the night he escaped the lieutenant of the company was\r\nkilled accidentally while showing the men how to use a gun, and during\r\nthe excitement incident to the killing, Mr. Schapp made his escape.\r\nDuring the night he secured a boat with one oar and drifted down the\r\nriver, landing at Ft. Leavenworth. Here he lost no time in enlisting in\r\nCaptain Black’s company which afterwards became a part of Company B,\r\nEighth Kansas regiment. The following night he piloted this company\r\nacross the river to Iatum where they surprised and captured the\r\nConfederate company of which he had been a member the day before. This\r\nact won from him the intense hatred of the members of the Confederate\r\ncompany, and even after the close of the war members of that company\r\nattempted to take his life. After serving about a month in Captain\r\nBlack’s company, he joined Company H, Eighteenth Missouri regiment and\r\nparticipated in a number of important engagements. After the battle of\r\nShiloh he was promoted to sergeant major. He was with Sherman on his\r\nmarch to the sea, and during that campaign, while at Decatur, Ala., his\r\nterm of enlistment expired and he received special permission to\r\naccompany General Sherman’s army through the campaign. On arriving at\r\nSavannah, Ga., he was placed in charge of fourteen soldiers whose term\r\nof enlistment had expired and was the first to arrive in New York City,\r\nwhere they were met by bands of music and were treated royally by the\r\npeople. He then returned to his former home in Platte county, but the\r\nsecession spirit was so strong and so much antipathy was shown him on\r\naccount of his loyalty to the Union that he decided not to remain, and\r\naccordingly, came to Atchison. The second night after arriving home he\r\nwas warned by a friendly member of the Confederate company he had\r\ndeserted to leave at once, as plans had been made to hang him. He left\r\nat once on the next train. He had saved about $800 during the war and\r\nloaned it to his uncle, John Bonns, who was engaged in the brewery\r\nbusiness, and through a failure, Mr. Schapp lost every dollar of his\r\nsavings. He then entered the employ of Julius Holthaus, who conducted a\r\nsaloon and a grocery store. About a year later he engaged in the\r\nmanufacture of brick in partnership with Jacob Nash. About five years\r\nlater he engaged in the ice business, which he conducted about six\r\nyears. He then bought a farm north of where the orphans’ home is\r\nlocated, where he remained for twelve years, when he sold his farm and\r\nremoved to Atchison, and engaged in the real estate business and has\r\nsince been engaged in that business. Mr. Schapp has been very successful\r\nand has accumulated considerable property.\r\n\r\nHe was married in February, 1865, to Miss Margaret, a daughter of\r\nGearhardt Kunders, a pioneer settler of Weston, Mo. Eight children have\r\nbeen born to Mr. and Mrs. Schapp, as follows: Peter P. resides in\r\nCalifornia; Dora F. resides at home; Mrs. Theodore Geritz, Atchison\r\ncounty; Mrs. Theodora Arensberg, Atchison; Mrs. Henry Wersling, Atchison\r\ncounty, and Albert A.; William H., deceased; Maggie, deceased.\r\n\r\nMr. Schapp is one of the old timers of Atchison, and has seen that town\r\ndevelop from a little settlement on the bank of the Missouri river to\r\nthe great prosperous commercial center that it is today. He has taken an\r\nactive part in the political life of Atchison, and for seven years was a\r\nmember of the city council, and served two years on the Atchison school\r\nboard. Mr. Schapp cast his first vote for Abraham Lincoln for President,\r\nand has been a stanch adherent to the policies and principles of the\r\nRepublican party since that day. He is a member of the Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THOMAS LINCOLN BLODGETT.\r\n\r\nThe passing of a good, industrious citizen from this mundane sphere to\r\nthe realms of a higher and better life beyond the grave is always\r\nsaddening, especially if his demise occurs while yet in the prime of his\r\nvigorous manhood. Such a one was Thomas Lincoln Blodgett, late of Mt.\r\nPleasant township, who, though not permitted to dwell upon this earth\r\nthe allotted time decreed for mankind, accomplished in the brief time he\r\nwas actively engaged in agricultural pursuits more than the average man,\r\nand will long be remembered for his many excellent qualities by those\r\nwho knew him best.\r\n\r\nThomas Lincoln Blodgett, late of Mt. Pleasant township, was born July\r\n27, 1860, and lived and died in the township in which he was born in\r\nAtchison county, his demise occurring May 4, 1905. He was a son of\r\nGeorge M. and Mary (Cline) Blodgett, his father having been born and\r\nreared in Michigan and came to Kansas when the State was created in the\r\nlate fifties.\r\n\r\nGeorge M. Blodgett, the father of Thomas Lincoln Blodgett, was born in\r\nLivingston county, New York, October 6, 1834, a son of George W. and\r\nLucinda (Garfield) Blodgett, and was a grandson of Thomas Blodgett.\r\nThomas Blodgett, who was a soldier under Washington and fought for the\r\nindependence of the American colonies, lived in Vermont, where he was a\r\nblacksmith and a farmer. He went to Michigan in 1856 and remained there\r\nto be near his son, George W., who had settled at Kalamazoo about 1846.\r\nMr. Rowel, the father of Thomas Blodgett’s wife, was also a\r\nRevolutionary soldier. The children of Thomas Blodgett were named George\r\nW., Riley and Jared. Riley went to Rhode Island and became connected\r\nwith shipping interests, navigating waters in the vicinity of Newport.\r\nThomas died in Michigan in 1850, aged ninety years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _T L Blodgett_\r\n]\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Blodgett, the father of George M., was born in Vermont in\r\n1800, and died in 1880, aged eighty years. His wife, Lucinda, was a\r\ndaughter of Solomon Garfield, of Ontario county, New York. She died in\r\n1840, leaving the following named children: Orinda, who married Thomas\r\nSanders; George M.; Emma, who was Mrs. Nathan Allen, of Michigan, and\r\nJohn, deceased.\r\n\r\nThe education of George M. Blodgett was limited and he became used to\r\nhard work at an early age. He worked as hired hand and at logging in the\r\npine woods of Michigan. When twenty-one years of age he left home and\r\nwent to Winnebago county, Illinois, and took charge of a quarter section\r\nof land for which he had traded. Not liking his prairie surroundings he\r\ntraded his farm for a small tract now within the limits of the city of\r\nMoline, Ill. He remained here for four years; then he traded this farm\r\nfor a farm in Iowa which he sold. With his small means he came to\r\nKansas, arriving in Atchison April 5, 1855. He took up a claim and\r\nbought land from the Delaware Indian lands and began developing his\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nWhen volunteers were called for at the outbreak of the Civil war, Mr.\r\nBlodgett offered himself for the defense of his country’s honor and was\r\naccepted as a member of Company F, Thirteenth regiment, Kansas infantry,\r\n(Colonel Bowen’s regiment), of the Seventh army corps, which was\r\nmustered into service at Leavenworth, Kan., and was in the military\r\ndepartment of the West. Mr. Blodgett was a sergeant of his company and\r\nparticipated in many battles fought by his regiment in Missouri and\r\neastern Arkansas and was once wounded by a bursting shell.\r\n\r\nGeorge M. Blodgett was married in 1857 to Mary E. Cline, a daughter of\r\nHenry Cline, an early settler of Atchison county. The children born to\r\nthis union were: Thomas Lincoln, Frank F., Frederick, Luther, Mrs.\r\nLavina Lawler, Mrs. Jessie Ellerman, and Lulu. The father of Thomas\r\nLincoln Blodgett became quite wealthy and accumulated 500 acres of land.\r\nHe served as deputy sheriff of the county in 1856 and filled many\r\noffices of trust in Mt. Pleasant township.\r\n\r\nGeorge M. settled on a pioneer farm in Mt. Pleasant township which he\r\ndeveloped, reared a family, and died in the home which he built to house\r\nhis family. He was the father of seven children, of whom Lincoln was the\r\neldest.\r\n\r\nThomas Lincoln Blodgett was named in honor of Abraham Lincoln, who was\r\ngreatly admired by the elder Blodgett. He was reared to young manhood on\r\nhis father’s farm and learned to become an excellent farmer and\r\nstockman. After his marriage in 1881 he and his young wife lived on a\r\nfarm owned by his father for four years, when they purchased 120 acres\r\nof land which formed the nucleus for a large farm which was later\r\nincreased to 400 acres, now owned by Mrs. Blodgett. The first tract was\r\nbought on time, but by industry, economy and self-denial on the part of\r\nthe ambitious couple, the debt was soon paid off and additional acreage\r\nwas gradually added as the years went on. Mr. Blodgett was a successful\r\nlive stock feeder and frequently fed one or two carloads of cattle on\r\nhis farm each year. He was noted as a good judge of cattle and made\r\nmoney in his operations. The Blodgett farm is well improved and is\r\nconsidered to be one of the best in Atchison county.\r\n\r\nHe was married August 18, 1881, to Miss Ella Hudson, and to this\r\nmarriage have been born five children, as follows: Robert, a farmer,\r\nnear Cummings, Atchison county, Kansas; George, managing the home farm;\r\nElmer, Mabel and Stella, at home with their mother. Stella is attending\r\nthe high school at Potter. Mrs. Blodgett was born May 20, 1862, in\r\nIllinois, and is a daughter of Cyrenus and Elizabeth (Shaw) Hudson, the\r\nformer of whom came to Kansas in 1867 with his family. Cyrenus Hudson\r\nwas a native of Illinois who made good in Kansas, and at one time was\r\nthe owner of 900 acres of land in Atchison and Jefferson counties,\r\nKansas. In 1901 he removed to a home in Potter, where he is living\r\nretired. With other live citizens of the thriving town he has taken an\r\nactive part in the upbuilding of his adopted city.\r\n\r\nDuring his life and ever since he attained his majority, Thomas Lincoln\r\nBlodgett was allied with the Republican party and took a prominent part\r\nin political and civic affairs in his home township and county. He was a\r\nprogressive citizen as well as a successful and progressive farmer who\r\nwas always in favor of matters which had for their intent the betterment\r\nof the public welfare and the advancement of the citizenship of Atchison\r\ncounty. He was ever ready to do his part in educational matters and was\r\na member of the local school board. He was fraternally allied with the\r\nModern Woodmen lodge, and was blessed with many warm friends and well\r\nwishers who esteemed him as a man and citizen. He was a kind parent who\r\nloved his wife and children and highly prized his home life and\r\nsurroundings, and was ever striving to make his family happy and\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOHN R. OLIVER.\r\n\r\nJohn R. Oliver, deceased pioneer of Atchison county, was born in Cayuga\r\ncounty, New York, April 5, 1825, and was a son of William Oliver, a\r\nnative of Scotland, who emigrated from his native land when a youth.\r\nJohn R. was educated in the schools of his native county and State and\r\nlearned the carpenter’s trade. He was married January 3, 1850, to Helen\r\nM. Packard, who was born in New York State February 17, 1832, a daughter\r\nof Thaxton Packard, of English extraction, who married a lady of Holland\r\ndescent. After John R. and Helen Oliver were married they settled at\r\nSterling Center, Cayuga county, New York, where Mr. Oliver worked at his\r\ntrade of contractor and builder until 1856, when he and his wife and two\r\nchildren came west and settled on a farm near the western border of\r\nAtchison county, in Grasshopper township. They became a part of the\r\nCayuga settlement, made up of several families who had migrated from\r\ntheir native county in New York State. There are only four of the\r\noriginal Cayuga colony living, as far as known: Fred L. Oliver, Frances\r\nJosephine Anderson, of Atchison; Mrs. Frank Boyington, of Atchison\r\ncounty, and brother, Samuel Adams. John R. Oliver came first, and in the\r\nfall of 1857 he sent back for his wife and two children to join him.\r\nMrs. Oliver and the children boarded a steamboat on Lake Erie and made\r\nthe voyage by way of the Great Lakes to Chicago, going from Chicago to\r\nLeavenworth, Kan., and thence by steamer to Atchison, from which place\r\nthey were taken across the county to the new home in the Cayuga\r\nsettlement, by a man named Sandy Coburn. The family lived in the\r\nsettlement for about six years and then moved to Leavenworth, Kan.,\r\nwhere they resided until Mr. Oliver’s death, in 1906; the wife and\r\nmother died in 1911. John R. Oliver served in the Kansas State militia\r\nduring the Price invasion, but was unable physically to withstand the\r\nrigors of the campaign which resulted in Price’s army of invasion being\r\ndriven southward. He was an ardent Republican in politics and was a\r\nfollower and supporter of Abraham Lincoln, to whom he was related by\r\nmarriage. Mr. and Mrs. Oliver were the parents of the following\r\nchildren: Fred L., born in Sterling Center, N. Y., November 8, 1851, now\r\nresiding in Atchison with his sister, Mrs. Anderson; Parthenia K., widow\r\nof Wesley Chaffee, a nephew of General Chaffee, was born August 8, 1861,\r\nand now resides in Leavenworth, Kan.\r\n\r\nFrances Josephine Oliver Anderson was born March 1, 1855, and was six\r\nyears of age when the family moved to Leavenworth. She received her\r\neducation in the public schools of Leavenworth and was married there on\r\nMay 8, 1873, to James A. Anderson, who was born March 16, 1849, in\r\nLoudon county, Virginia, about twenty miles south of Washington, D. C.\r\nAn anecdote which tells of the stirring and troublesome times in the\r\nbeginning of the Civil war is here worth recording. When a child on the\r\nfarm in Atchison county, Mrs. Anderson and her teacher, Miss Missouri\r\nBatsell stayed all night at the home of the Reece family, as it was\r\nunsafe to be abroad after dark. This was in the fall of 1861. Mr. Reece,\r\nthe head of the family, was very ill. Along about dark the people of the\r\nReece home heard a furious noise of yelling and shooting outside. The\r\nnoise makers rapped on the door with the butts of their guns, and when\r\nMrs. Reece opened the door it was ascertained that the night prowlers\r\nwere a band of Bushwhackers who demanded a meal. She told them that her\r\nhusband was very ill, and that she had nothing cooked which would\r\nsuffice for a meal. They swore at her, and after talking the matter over\r\ndecided to go to the barn and steal the horses for their own use. The\r\ngang went toward the barn, and another altercation arose among them\r\nwhich resulted in the killing of one of the men who had counseled them\r\nnot to steal the horses. A dead body was thrust through the doorway and\r\nslid part way across the floor after a shot was fired. Mrs. Anderson has\r\nnever forgotten the horrors of that night.\r\n\r\nJames A. Anderson was a son of Charles W. and Mary Francis (Hough)\r\nAnderson, both of whom were members of very old and prominent families\r\nin Virginia, the Hough family being large plantation and slave holders.\r\nCharles W. Anderson was profoundly opposed to the institution of\r\nslavery, and was high in the councils of the Democratic party. He was a\r\nthirty-second degree Mason and was a personal friend of men high in the\r\nGovernment affairs at Washington, D. C. A son, Fleming Anderson, was\r\nkilled by Mosby’s guerrillas while at home from the war on a furlough,\r\nand was shot as he ran out of the door of his home. Charles W. Anderson\r\nwas a paymaster in the Union army and was killed by robbers while on\r\nofficial duty. After the death of the father of the family, James A.,\r\nwith his widowed mother and sister. Mrs. Captain Spence, Charles W., and\r\nC. C. Anderson of the transfer company, of Atchison, came to Kansas,\r\nfirst residing at Topeka, then at Lawrence shortly after Quantrell’s\r\nraid. James was but seventeen years old at this time, and being the\r\neldest son was the actual head of the family. When still a young man he\r\nengaged in the transfer business and took a contract from the Government\r\nto supply Ft. Leavenworth with fuel, and while fulfilling his contract\r\nwith the Government, and transporting goods to and from the fort, he met\r\nand fell in love with his future wife, Frances Josephine Oliver, and the\r\nmarriage took place as stated in the preceding paragraph. After the\r\nmarriage Mr. and Mrs. Anderson lived in Lawrence, Kan., until their\r\nremoval to Atchison, in July of 1873. Mr. Anderson continued in the\r\ntransfer business and established the Anderson Transfer Company. He had\r\nassociates at various times, but was always at the head of the company.\r\nHe died July 12, 1906. His widow, Mrs. Frances Josephine Anderson, is\r\none of the best known ladies of Atchison and is prominent in social and\r\nreligious circles. When thirteen years of age she became a Christian and\r\nbecame a member of the Atchison Methodist Episcopal Church in 1883. She\r\nhas been actively and prominently identified with the church work for\r\nmany years, and has been especially successful as a teacher of boys. She\r\nis a class leader of the church and a member of the official board, and\r\nwas captain of one of the teams which raised a $43,000 fund to provide\r\nfor the erection of the new Methodist Episcopal church building. She is\r\na charter member of the Epworth League and is a singer of ability,\r\nhaving sung in the Methodist Episcopal church choir for thirty years. In\r\n1911 she began her evangelical career, in which chosen field she is\r\nachieving marked success. Mrs. Anderson is a member of the Knights and\r\nLadies of Security and is affiliated with the home and foreign\r\nmissionary societies of the Methodist Episcopal church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LEO NUSBAUM.\r\n\r\nFaithfulness to duty and perseverance invariably bring their reward.\r\nGive a truly ambitious young man an opportunity to advance himself, and\r\nhe will succeed. The opportunity was given to Leo Nusbaum, vice-\r\npresident of the Dolan Mercantile Company of Atchison, and he has made a\r\nsuccess of the business in which he began at the lowest rung of the\r\nladder. Entering the employ of the firm of which he is now one of the\r\nimportant heads, he worked his way steadily upward until he is now one\r\nof the recognized business factors in the city of Atchison.\r\n\r\nLeo Nusbaum was born in Poweshiek county, Iowa, December 6, 1877, and is\r\nthe son of Frederick and Eva (Link) Nusbaum, both natives of Germany.\r\nFrederick Nusbaum was born in the Fatherland in 1855, and came to\r\nAmerica in 1869, when a boy fourteen years of age. He worked as a farm\r\nhand in Iowa, and eventually owned a farm of his own. From Iowa he moved\r\nto Nebraska where he purchased and operated a farm. From Nebraska he\r\nremoved to St. Joseph, Mo., where he was employed in a grain elevator.\r\nHe died in St. Joseph in 1903.\r\n\r\nHe, with whom this review is directly concerned, was educated in the\r\nschools of Council Bluffs, and St. Peter’s parochial school, and came to\r\nAtchison in 1898. On coming here he entered the employ of the Dolan\r\nMercantile Company as office boy and packer. His first work consisted of\r\npreparing orders for shipment. After attaining proficiency in this\r\ndepartment, he was promoted to the position of billing clerk and made a\r\nsuccess in this department. being next advanced to the position of city\r\nsalesman for the concern. All the while he was studying the wholesale\r\nbusiness, and gaining such a knowledge as would best fit him to take a\r\nmore responsible position in the affairs of the company. His next\r\nimportant service was as the secretary of the company. From this place\r\nit was but a step to the sales managership. Upon the demise of William\r\nF. Dolan, the founder of the wholesale business, in the year 1913, Mr.\r\nNusbaum became vice-president and one of the managers. He and his\r\nassociates, in charge of the Dolan Mercantile Company’s affairs, are\r\ncapable and energetic men who are building up a more extensive business\r\nupon the broad and stable foundation erected by its late founder, whose\r\nexample has been an inspiration and guide to the young men whom he took\r\ninto his employ and educated in the details of his extensive business.\r\nMr. Nusbaum has justified the confidence and faith held in his ability\r\nby his employer, and is an able and dignified executive.\r\n\r\nMr. Nusbaum was united in marriage with Gertrude Delaney, at Atchison,\r\nKan., in 1900. She is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Martin Delaney. To this\r\nunion four children have been born, who are the pride of their parents,\r\nnamely: Leo, Mary Clare, Robert, and Frances. Mr. and Mrs. Nusbaum are\r\nmembers of the Catholic church and have a host of friends who esteem\r\nthem for their many excellent qualities. Mr. Nusbaum is a director of\r\nthe First National Bank of Atchison and a vice-president of the Atchison\r\nCommercial Club and the Atchison Hospital. He is politically allied with\r\nthe Democratic party. His primary interests, however, are mainly\r\nconcerned with the growing success of his firm, and the welfare and\r\ngrowth of his home city, and he is universally recognized as a citizen\r\nof worth and standing in the community. He was the most active force in\r\nthe organization of the Atchison Commercial Club, called its first\r\nmeeting and has been continuously one of its most aggressive members.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHARLES J. KEITHLINE.\r\n\r\nCharles J. Keithline, a prosperous farmer and stockman of Lancaster\r\ntownship, Atchison county, Kansas, is a native of the Keystone State,\r\nand is a descendant of an old American family which traces its ancestry\r\nback to the Revolutionary days, when the founder of the family in\r\nAmerica, Colonel Keithline, came from Germany, his native land, to\r\nAmerica with Baron De Kalb, and assisted the colonial army to achieve\r\nAmerican independence. Charles J. was born in Luzerne county,\r\nPennsylvania, July 9, 1857, a son of Samuel and Eliza (Hoover)\r\nKeithline, both of whom were born and reared in Pennsylvania and there\r\nmarried. Samuel Keithline was a son of John and Mary (Neyhart)\r\nKeithline, who also lived in Luzerne county, Pennsylvania. The great\r\ngrandfather of Charles J. was Joseph Keithline, who served in the War of\r\n1812, and made buckskin breeches for the United States Government, which\r\nwere worn by the United States soldiers. He was a tailor by trade.\r\nSamuel Keithline learned the trade of wagon maker in his younger days\r\nand operated a wagon shop at Hanover, Penn. He lived in his native State\r\nuntil 1884, when he migrated to Kansas and invested his capital in land\r\nin Shannon township upon which he lived in retirement until his demise\r\nin 1900, at the advanced age of eighty-two years. Samuel and Eliza\r\nKeithline were the parents of the following children: John A. died May\r\n17, 1915, in Atchison, Kan.; Samuel died in infancy; Joseph died at the\r\nage of three years; Charles J.; Augustus L., Lancaster township; Sarah\r\nE., in Shannon township; Emma Carlton, Franklin county, Kansas, and Mrs.\r\nCora Riley, Atchison, Kan. The mother of Charles died in 1910, at the\r\nage of seventy-nine years.\r\n\r\nCharles J. Keithline, with whom this narrative is directly concerned,\r\nwas educated in the graded schools of Nanticoke, Penn., and worked as\r\nfarm hand in Pennsylvania. In 1883, five years after his marriage in\r\n1879, he migrated westward with his family to Kansas, and located on a\r\nfarm in Shannon township on the old home place. He rented land for\r\ntwenty-eight years and finally became the owner of the fine farm which\r\nhe is now cultivating. This farm is fitted with excellent improvements\r\nconsisting of an attractive farm residence and excellent out-buildings,\r\nmuch of which has been erected or remodeled by the proprietor. The 187\r\nacres comprised in this farm are well and closely cultivated so as to\r\nyield the maximum of results. The farm is nicely located six miles west\r\nof Atchison on the Parallel road. Mr. Keithline has been a breeder of\r\nPoland China hogs for several years and takes pride in the animals bred\r\nand raised on his place.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1879 to Frances Goss at Wilkes-Barre, Penn., and this\r\nunion has been blessed with the following children: Ira, a hardware\r\ndealer in Atchison, Kan.; Samuel, a farmer, living at home with his\r\nparents; Amy, deceased; Mrs. Elsie Vollmer, Bronson, Kan.; Frances,\r\nliving at home; Grant, deceased; Charles died in infancy. The mother of\r\nthese children was born in Pennsylvania in 1856, and was a daughter of\r\nFloren and Maria (Keyser) Goss, the former a native of Germany and the\r\nlatter a native of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nMr. Keithline is identified with the Republican party, but has never\r\nbeen an aspirant for political preferment. He and the members of his\r\nfamily are affiliated religiously with the Methodist Episcopal church\r\nand contribute of their means to its support. He is fraternally allied\r\nwith the Modern Woodmen lodge, and during his residence in this county\r\nhas taken an active and influential part in affairs which concern the\r\nwelfare of the people in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SHEFFIELD INGALLS.\r\n\r\nSheffield Ingalls is a resident and a native son of Atchison, having\r\nbeen born in that city March 28, 1875. He is a son of the late United\r\nStates Senator John James Ingalls. Mr. Ingalls’ ancestors, both paternal\r\nand maternal, were representative New England pioneers. The Ingalls\r\nfamily in America originated with Edmond Ingalls, who with his brother,\r\nFrancis, founded Lynn, Mass., in 1628. The mother of our subject was\r\nAnna Louisa Chesebrough, a direct descendant of William Chesebrough, who\r\nemigrated to America with John Winthrop in 1630. The paternal\r\ngrandparents of our subject were Elias T. and Eliza (Chase) Ingalls, the\r\nformer of whom was a first cousin of Mehitable Ingalls, the grandmother\r\nof President Garfield, while the latter, Eliza Chase, was descended from\r\nAquilla Chase, who settled in New Hampshire, in 1630, and who was also\r\nthe ancestor of the late Chief Justice Chase.\r\n\r\nSheffield Ingalls was reared principally in his native town and received\r\nhis public school education at Atchison and at Washington, D. C. After\r\nattending Midland College at Atchison for four years he entered the\r\nUniversity of Kansas and was graduated in that institution in June,\r\n1895, with the degree of Bachelor of Arts. He then studied law and was\r\nadmitted to the bar in 1897, but as the profession did not appeal to him\r\nhe practiced but little and turned his attention to more genial\r\npursuits. He early developed a predilection for politics and became\r\nactively identified with the Republican party in both the city and\r\ncounty of Atchison at an early age. In July, 1898, he was appointed\r\npolice judge of Atchison by Mayor Donald and, in April, 1899, was\r\nelected to the same office for a term of two years, serving until April,\r\n1901. In the spring of 1904 he was a prominent candidate for the\r\nRepublican nomination for probate judge, but through the exigencies of\r\npolitics, instead of receiving the nomination sought for, he was\r\nnominated by the same convention for the legislature from the third\r\nrepresentative district. However, at the election his opponent, Edward\r\nPerdue, defeated him by thirty-two votes. Two years later he was\r\nnominated again for the legislature from the same district and received\r\na tie vote with Alonzo Wilcox. The contest was decided by lot in Topeka\r\nand Mr. Ingalls won. He served as a member of several important\r\ncommittees and was made chairman of the committee on education. He cast\r\nhis vote for Charles Curtis for United States senator, and in the work\r\nof that session became actively identified with that progressive element\r\nin the legislature which was known at that time as “the boss busters.”\r\nHe is in sympathy with all efforts to purify politics and to raise the\r\ntone of public life and during that session he voted for all reform\r\nlegislation. He is a man of deep convictions, a political and social\r\nreformer of exceptional ability and courage, and has always opposed\r\nmachine politics. It was due to an obnoxious political machine’s\r\ninfluence in local Republican circles at Atchison that Mr. Ingalls\r\nentered the arena of political strife in order to assist in effectively\r\nopposing said machine and to secure needed reform in political methods.\r\nShortly after the adjournment of the legislature Mr. Ingalls assumed the\r\neditorial management of the _Atchison Champion_, and for the following\r\ntwo years exposed through its columns the corruption in city affairs and\r\nfought against the domination of the city by a political ring. He then\r\nendeavored to purchase a controlling interest in the _Champion_ to\r\nenable him to be more aggressive in fighting corruption though its\r\ncolumns, but through various influences operating against him he was\r\nunsuccessful. In the fall of 1907 he originated and organized the\r\nCommercial State Bank and served as its vice-president until its\r\nconsolidation with the First National Bank, in the spring of 1910. He\r\nthen organized the Commerce Investment Company, of which he was made\r\npresident and continuously served as such until March 2, 1916, when he\r\nbecame the president of the Commerce Trust Company of Atchison, a\r\ncompany which is a development of the Commerce Investment Company.\r\nBesides the interests mentioned he is a director of the First National\r\nBank and also of the Railway Specialty Company of Atchison. He was\r\nappointed a member of the board of regents of the Kansas State normal\r\nschools by Governor Stubbs in April, 1908. He is a member of the State\r\nHistorical Society, and is a member of the Sons of the Revolution.\r\nFraternally he is a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of\r\nElks.\r\n\r\nOn January 9, 1901, was solemnized the marriage of Mr. Ingalls and Miss\r\nLucy Cornell Van Hoesen, of Lawrence, Kan. To their union five children\r\nhave been born: Robert Chesebrough, who died in infancy; Ruth Constance,\r\nSarah Sheffield, John James, and David Bagle.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 Mr. Ingalls received the Republican nomination for lieutenant-\r\ngovernor of Kansas and was elected, although the head of the State\r\nticket was defeated. It fell to Mr. Ingalls’ lot to preside over a\r\nDemocratic senate, which he did in such a fair and impartial manner as\r\nto win the commendation of both Democrats and Republicans. (_Copied from\r\nBlackmar’s History of Kansas and revised by R. M. Gibson._)\r\n\r\n\r\n                           E. P. PITTS, M. D.\r\n\r\nE. P. Pitts, M. D., a prominent Atchison physician and surgeon, and well\r\nknown specialist in diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat, is a\r\nnative of Virginia. Dr. Pitts was born in Northampton county, Virginia,\r\nOctober 13, 1880, and is a son of E. D. and Emory (West) Pitts, both\r\nnatives of the Old Dominion. E. D. Pitts, the father, was a prominent\r\nlawyer and was successfully engaged in the practice of his profession\r\nfor a number of years at Norfolk, Va. He was a son of Edward P. Pitts,\r\nwho was also a prominent Virginia lawyer of Northampton county, and for\r\na number of years served as United States district judge in Virginia. He\r\nwas a graduate of William and Mary’s College, and Dr. Pitts still has in\r\nhis possession the diploma which his grandfather received from that\r\ninstitution. The Pitts family is of English descent and traces its\r\nancestry back to the Hon. William Pitt, Earl of Chatham. Dr. Pitt’s\r\nmother belongs to an old Virginia family, and is also of English\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nDr. Pitts was reared to manhood in his native State and received a good\r\neducation. When he was eighteen years of age he went to St. Joseph, Mo.,\r\nwhere two of his uncles, brothers of his father, were practicing\r\nphysicians. Here, Dr. Pitts entered the Ensworth Medical College in\r\n1898, and was graduated in the class of 1902 with the degree of Doctor\r\nof Medicine. He then studied under, and practiced in conjunction, with\r\nDr. Barton Pitts, his uncle, who is a noted specialist in diseases of\r\nthe eye, ear, nose and throat. Dr. Pitts then went to New York, and\r\nafter spending six months in an eye and ear infirmary, he came to\r\nAtchison in the summer of 1902 and engaged in the practice of his\r\nprofession, specializing in diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat.\r\nDr. Pitts has met with a marked degree of success in his chosen field of\r\nspecial professional work. He is a close student of the wonderful\r\nadvances made in his profession and ranks as a leader.\r\n\r\nDr. Pitts was united in marriage to Miss Beulah Judah, a daughter of\r\nSamuel Judah, of Buchanan county, Missouri, and Dr. and Mrs. Pitts have\r\none child, Spencer, born in 1907. Dr. Pitts is a member of the Masonic\r\nlodge and the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOHN FANKHANEL.\r\n\r\nJohn Fankhanel, deceased, was born June 11, 1822, in Saxony, Germany.\r\nWhen a youth he learned the blacksmith’s trade which he plied in his\r\nnative village until 1862, when he immigrated to America, first settling\r\nin Weston, Mo., and later going to Ft. Leavenworth, where he was\r\nemployed as a blacksmith by the United States Government. He saved his\r\nmoney, and in 1879 came to Atchison county and invested in 160 acres of\r\nland in Benton township, located four miles northeast of Effingham. He\r\nimproved this farm and cultivated it successfully for a number of years,\r\nand about the year 1900 he turned it over to his son, Henry, and\r\npurchased the farm now owned by Gus Stutz. He resided on this place\r\nuntil his retirement to a comfortable home in Lancaster in 1901, where\r\nhe died December 24, 1914, leaving a reputation for honesty and industry\r\nsecond to none in his neighborhood. Mr. Fankhanel was a member of the\r\nGerman Lutheran church. He was twice married, his first wife having been\r\nborn in Germany, and died in Leavenworth, Kan., leaving one son, Henry,\r\nnow a farmer in Benton township.\r\n\r\nMr. Fankhanel was again married in 1882, to Mrs. Emma Lindel, widow of\r\nFrederick Lindel. She was born in Bavaria, Germany, August 20, 1841, and\r\nlived in her native country until she was eighteen years of age, and\r\nthen came to Illinois. Shortly after her arrival she married Frederick\r\nLindel, also a native of Germany, and a farmer in Illinois. To this\r\nunion were born five children, two of whom are living, namely: Mrs.\r\nMinnie Dorety, of Garfield, Okla.; and Herman, a farmer, residing near\r\nLeavenworth, Kan. The marriage of John and Emma Fankhanel was without\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fankhanel is a capable and worthy lady, who enjoys the respect and\r\nesteem of her neighbors and friends. She is kind and neighborly, and is\r\never ready to assist those of her acquaintances who are in need. She is\r\nliving in Lancaster in comfortable circumstances, where she owns a good\r\nhome and village property, and also a farm of sixty-five acres in\r\nLeavenworth county. She is a member of the German Lutheran church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EDWARD J. KELLY.\r\n\r\nEdward J. Kelly, cashier of the Farmers and Merchants State Bank, of\r\nEffingham, was born June 14, 1868, at New Brunswick, N. J., a son of\r\nJames and Alice (Tobin) Kelly, both natives of Ireland. Upon immigrating\r\nto this country in 1844 they made their first home in New Jersey, and\r\nfrom there came to Kansas in 1869, locating in Grasshopper township,\r\nwhere James met with wonderful success as an agriculturist. His first\r\ninvestment was for eighty acres of prairie land which he improved and\r\ngradually added to his holdings until he was the owner of 500 acres of\r\ngood land. James Kelly accumulated his estate by the exercise of good\r\njudgment in his farming operations, hard labor, and the exercise of the\r\nstrictest economy. At first he did not like the new country. Becoming\r\ndiscouraged, as many others did, after the bad years during the\r\nseventies, he sold out, but fortunately, as it later proved for him, he\r\nwas compelled to take back his land from the purchaser. He later changed\r\nhis opinion concerning the future of Kansas and invested heavily in land\r\nat every opportunity. James Kelly was born in 1828, and died in 1894.\r\nHis wife was born in 1830, and died in 1912. He first came to America in\r\n1844 when but sixteen years of age, and was married in New Jersey. The\r\nchildren of this estimable pioneer couple were: James, who died at the\r\nage of seven years; Lawrence P., a resident of Colorado Springs, Colo.;\r\nEdward J., and Mary E., residing in Effingham.\r\n\r\nEdward J. Kelly was educated in the district schools and spent two years\r\nas a student in St. Benedict’s College in Atchison. He lived on the old\r\nhome place of his parents until 1885, in the meantime improving one of\r\nhis father’s farms in Benton township, upon which he moved and resided\r\nthereon until 1894, at which time he married and moved on another farm\r\nwhich he owned in the same township. Mr. Kelly followed farming until\r\n1903, and then removed to Effingham and engaged in the hardware and\r\ngrain business for a period of five years. In 1909 he entered the State\r\nBank of Effingham as bookkeeper and remained one year, when he became\r\nfinancially interested in the Farmers and Merchants State Bank, of which\r\nhe is the present efficient cashier.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly was married February 16, 1898, to Mary Gerety, of Monrovia,\r\nKan., a daughter of Richard and Sarah Rooney Gerety, natives of Ireland,\r\nwho first immigrated to Indiana, and from there came to Kansas as early\r\nas 1856. Both are now deceased. The Gerety’s settled on the prairie\r\nsouth of Monrovia, when Indians were camping in the neighborhood. They\r\nlived there all of their days and prospered. Richard Gerety died in\r\n1906, and his widow removed to Effingham, where she died in 1910. They\r\nwere the parents of the following living children: Mrs. Elizabeth\r\n(Berney), Horton, Kan.; Thomas Gerety, near Nortonville, Kan.; James,\r\nEverest, Kan.; John, Wichita, Kan.; Margaret, Independence, Kan.;\r\nRichard, Wichita, Kan.; Sarah, Colorado Springs, Colo. During the Civil\r\nwar Mr. Gerety purchased horses for the United States Government.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone as a farmer, merchant and banker that Mr. Kelly has\r\nachieved a certain amount of prominence, but he has taken an active part\r\nin political affairs during his life and stands high in the councils of\r\nthe Democratic party. He was elected to represent Atchison county in the\r\nState legislature in the session of 1909, and during that session\r\nacquitted himself creditably as an honest and fearless legislator. He\r\nwas a member of the committees on roads and highways, mines and mining,\r\nand judicial apportionments, etc., and has the unique record of never\r\nmissing a roll call of the house while attending the session. Mr. Kelly\r\nhas likewise shown his interest in his home city by serving on the city\r\ncouncil for four years. His religious affiliations are with the Catholic\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Farmers and Merchants State Bank, Effingham, Kansas._\r\n\r\nThis bank was organized in 1905, with a capital stock of $12,000, and\r\nofficers as follows: President, U. B. Sharpless; secretary and cashier,\r\nA. J. Smith; vice-president, Fred Sutter; directors, R. M. Thomas, J. W.\r\nDavis, C. N. Snyder, U. B. Sharpless, A. J. Smith. Since this time there\r\nhave been some changes in the personnel of the official body governing\r\nthe bank’s affairs, and the present officers are as follows: President,\r\nFred Sutter; vice-president, L. T. Hawk; cashier, E. J. Kelly; assistant\r\ncashier, D. R. Gerety; directors, Fred Sutter, L. T. Hawk, Alexander\r\nMcKay, U. B. Sharpless; E. J. Kelly. The capital and surplus now exceed\r\n$15,000 and the bank averages in deposits over $120,000. In 1910 the\r\nbank erected a handsome brick building on the corner of Main and Howard\r\nstreets, which is fitted up with handsome new fixtures and a new burglar\r\nproof vault of the latest construction at a cost of over $4,000. This\r\nbank is purely a local concern and is financed by local capital, all of\r\nthe stockholders residing in Effingham and vicinity, and comprising the\r\nleading merchants and farmers of Effingham and the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BENTON L. BROCKETT.\r\n\r\nSuccessful business man, upright citizen and Christian worker, are\r\ncharacterizations which aptly describe Benton L. Brockett, who has been\r\nestablished in the lumber business in Atchison for over thirty years. He\r\nbegan as a poor man with little capital, and has built up a splendid\r\nretail concern at 1019 Main street. Mr. Brockett first established a\r\nsmall lumber yard at East Atchison in 1885, and six years later moved to\r\nAtchison. His buildings and warerooms occupy space 175×150 feet, and he\r\nemploys six men and four teams to handle his extensive business. The\r\nconcern supplies Atchison and vicinity with lumber, lime, cement, and\r\nbuilder’s material, including cement blocks, and practically all\r\nmaterials used in building. The yard work includes the only cement\r\nworking plant in the city which turns out cement blocks for foundation\r\nwork and porches.\r\n\r\nBenton L. Brockett was born in Ashtabula, Ohio, September 5, 1864. His\r\nparents were Lewis B. and Lucy S. (Fisk) Brockett, natives of New York\r\nand Ohio, respectively. The Brockett family is of English origin, and\r\nthe founder of the family in America first settled near New London,\r\nConn. His descendants afterward located in the state of New York. Lewis\r\nB. was the son of Ambrose Brockett, who moved to Ashtabula county, and\r\nwas one of the first settlers of the Western Reserve. Here Lewis was\r\nreared, and married Lucy S. Fisk, a daughter of an early settler of the\r\nWestern Reserve. He became a merchant at Saybrook, and served as\r\npostmaster under President Cleveland’s administration. He died at the\r\nadvanced age of eighty-six years. The mother of Benton L. is still\r\nliving and is now over eighty-three years of age. To them were born\r\nthree sons and three daughters, namely: James D., of Lincoln, Neb.;\r\nHaddie, the wife of Charles C. Parker, a resident of Portland. Ore.;\r\nEllen F., residing in Ashtabula; and Amy, the wife of Charles Simon, of\r\nAshtabula, Ohio; and two died in infancy.\r\n\r\nBenton L. was educated in the Ashtabula schools, and came west in 1884,\r\nwhere he engaged in business, as stated in a preceding paragraph.\r\nSuccess has attended his efforts, and he is universally recognized as\r\none of the substantial men of the city. The account of the growth of Mr.\r\nBrockett’s business is simply a narrative of his life work on the\r\nmaterial side. His prosperity is well deserved, and has been acquired by\r\nclose application to his affairs and square and honorable dealings with\r\nhis fellow men. Mr. Brockett was married on October 10, 1888, to Daisy\r\nDenton, a daughter of Henry Denton, an attorney of Atchison; she died\r\nJuly 15, 1898, leaving two sons, namely: Louis D., born August 14, 1889,\r\nwho is associated in the real estate and loan business with C. D.\r\nWalker, and married Isabella, a daughter of Mr. Walker. The second son\r\nis Wallace James Brockett, born February 14, 1895, and is a student at\r\nBaker University, at Baldwin, Kan. On July 23, 1903, Mr. Brockett\r\nmarried Margaret Schriver, a daughter of Peter P. Schriver, of Cedar\r\nPoint, Kan. To this union one child has been born, Helen Louise, born\r\nNovember 12, 1907.\r\n\r\nMr. Brockett has always espoused the principles of the Republican party,\r\nalthough his father was a Democrat. He has served his home city as a\r\nmember of the city council, and has been generally active in all\r\nundertakings tending to advance the best interests of Atchison and make\r\nthe city a better and more attractive place in which to live. He is a\r\nmember of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons. It is in church work,\r\nhowever, that Mr. Brockett is most active, aside from his business\r\naffairs. Ever since coming to the West he has been identified with\r\nchurch and Sunday school work, and is a prominent and active member of\r\nthe Methodist Episcopal church. He supplemented his work in behalf of\r\nmaking better men and women of the growing boys and girls of this\r\nlocality in East Atchison, where he has conducted a mission school for\r\nthe past four years. He is a trustee of his church, and has taken part\r\nin the work of the Sunday school for several years. The highest tribute\r\nthat can be paid to him is that he is universally known as an earnest\r\nChristian, who has reared his family to be valuable members of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JOHN STUTZ.\r\n\r\nJohn Stutz, one of the younger successful farmers of Center township,\r\nAtchison county, was born November 5, 1870, on his father’s farm in\r\nLancaster township. His parents were Christian and Kathrine Stutz,\r\nconcerning whom a complete review is given in the biographies of Gustave\r\nand Christian W. Stutz. The reader is referred to these sketches for the\r\nhistory of this worthy pioneer couple, who were among the early settlers\r\nof the county. John grew up on the home farm and attended the public\r\nschools of Lancaster, remaining at home with his parents until 1898, at\r\nwhich time his father died and John was employed by the Cain Milling\r\nCompany of Atchison for two months. He became heir to eighty acres of\r\nland as his share of the family estate, and began farming for himself.\r\nHis farm was only partly improved by a small shack and granary. He at\r\nonce set about to remedy conditions on the land, and erected a\r\nsubstantial home, a good barn and other out-buildings which are well\r\nkept. He built a two-story five-room house, and in 1903 erected a fine\r\nbarn, 48×30 feet in dimension. He has also added to his acreage, and now\r\nowns 160 acres of highly productive land.\r\n\r\nMr. Stutz was married October 8, 1895, to Nora Walz, and to this union\r\nhave been born three children, namely: Christian W., Grover J. and\r\nLester E. all at home with their parents. Mrs. Nora Stutz was born\r\nAugust 24, 1876, on a farm in Shannon township, a daughter of Charles\r\nand Margaret (Diehsback) Walz. Charles Walz, the father, was twice\r\nmarried, his first wife being Kathrine Reidel, who bore him four\r\nchildren: Mrs. Rosa Buff, of Shannon township; Charles, deceased; Mary\r\nmarried Fred Stutz, a member of the Atchison police force, and Kathrine,\r\nwife of Christian W. Stutz. By the second marriage of Charles Walz, that\r\nwith Margaret Diehsback, there were born eight children, as follows:\r\nMargaret, wife of Gustave Stutz, of Lancaster township; Nora, wife of\r\nJohn Stutz, the subject of this sketch; Frederick, deceased: Mrs. Anna\r\nHager, of Atchison; William, farmer, Shannon township; Mrs. Clara\r\nPeterson, Atchison; Albert, Atchison; and Jerry resides on the old home\r\nplace, in Shannon township.\r\n\r\nMr. Stutz is a Democrat, and a member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles.\r\nNaturally he has a deep and abiding love for his home county, and thinks\r\nthere is no place on earth better than Atchison county. His labor and\r\ninterests have generally been given towards the welfare of his home\r\ncounty, and his standing in his community is assured, as a well\r\nrespected and industrious citizen who has the respect and esteem of all\r\nwho know him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              A. S. SPECK.\r\n\r\nThe Speck family is one of the oldest of the pioneer families in Kansas\r\nand the date of the settlement of A. S. Speck in Atchison county goes\r\nback to sixty years ago, when in September 20, 1855, Mr. and Mrs. Speck\r\nwith their two children arrived at the banks of the Missouri river,\r\nafter a six weeks’ trip overland in a covered wagon from their old home\r\nin an eastern State. They crossed the river by ferry to the Kansas side\r\nand landed near old Sumner, traveled over the hills and finally stopped\r\nat a little log cabin, not far from Stranger creek, which stream is said\r\nto have received its name from an unknown man having been drowned in the\r\nstream some years previous. The Specks made a settlement in the county\r\nand experienced a great deal of trouble from the border ruffians and\r\npro-slavery advocates because of the fact that Mr. Speck was a\r\npronounced anti-slavery man. It was the aim of the border ruffians to\r\nintimidate or “get rid” of all Free State people in order to gain their\r\nends and make Kansas a slave State. A story concerning these troublous\r\ntimes is timely here. One afternoon Mrs. Speck glanced from her cabin\r\ndoor and saw a cannon facing the house and planted on a little knoll\r\nwith about thirty men surrounding the sinister looking weapon. They sent\r\none of their number to the door of the cabin to ascertain if Mr. Speck\r\nwas at home. In reply to their question as to Mr. Speck’s whereabouts,\r\nMrs. Speck said, “If he were here he would never send his wife to talk\r\nfor him.” After a long conference the men went away, but returned that\r\nnight and demanded the privilege of searching the house. All the weapon\r\nof defense Mrs. Speck had was an axe which she held in her hand when she\r\nopened the door. As the door was opened she asked for the revolver held\r\nby one of the men who entered. This he refused to do, but the leader of\r\nthe gang, a man named Adkins, called out with an oath, “Give it to her,\r\nwe will protect you.” The gang searched the house thoroughly and were\r\nsatisfied that the man they sought was not there. They then went away\r\nleaving the children crying in fear, and the mother so fearful of her\r\nlife that she sat up the remainder of the night on the outside of the\r\ncabin with her babe in her arms, thinking they would return. Not long\r\nafter this came the news of the Quantrell raid and the burning of\r\nLawrence, Kan., and Mr. Speck with others went to the relief of the\r\nsufferers. The ruffians returned to the Speck cabin in the afternoon of\r\nthe day of Mr. Speck’s departure, but this time Mrs. Speck was armed\r\nwith a gun which Mr. Speck had left with her. She also had another gun\r\nwhich had been given her by a neighbor named Martin, who had had similar\r\ntrouble with the ruffians, who searched through Martin’s cornfield for\r\nhim, and when the raiders would get near him he would slip away unseen\r\nto the rows through which they had already searched and thus elude them.\r\nWhen the men saw the gun one of them insisted that she give it up, and\r\nwrenched it from her hands. She at once reached for the other gun which\r\nshe kept hidden behind her and fired at her assailant, frightening him\r\nso that he dropped the gun he had seized and ran from the vicinity of\r\nthe home. The others who remained near the cannon saw on a high ridge\r\nsome distance away what they thought was a company of men coming to\r\ncapture them. They at once took flight and left hastily, leaving behind\r\nthem a long rope which was evidently intended to be used in hanging Mr.\r\nSpeck. The small army seen in the distance later proved to be neighbors\r\ndriving a herd of cattle. One little son of the family made a vow to\r\nwhip Adkins when he grew up and had the later satisfaction of fulfilling\r\nhis vow when still a boy. The old neighbor of “cornfield fame” still\r\nlives in practically the same locality. Pardee Butler, the famous Free\r\nState advocate, who was placed on a raft and set adrift on the Missouri\r\nby border ruffians, was an intimate friend of the Speck family. When the\r\nCivil war broke out and the call for volunteers was sent out by\r\nPresident Lincoln, Mr. Speck enlisted as lieutenant of Company F,\r\nThirteenth regiment, Kansas infantry, in September, 1862, serving until\r\nhis resignation, and later being appointed recruiting officer in August,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Speck lived on their farm until death took them, the demise\r\nof Mr. Speck occurring in February, 1901, and that of Mrs. Speck\r\noccurring January, 1904. They are survived by eight children: William\r\nA., of Kay See, Wyo.; Frank, James and Arthur, of Nortonville, Kan.;\r\nMrs. D. P. Barber, of Cummings, Kan.; Mrs. Joseph Hotchkiss, of Willow\r\nSprings, Mo.; Mrs. S. W. Adams, of Atchison, Kan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ROBERT L. GRIMES.\r\n\r\nRobert L. Grimes, farmer and stockman, of Lancaster township, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, is one of the representative and enterprising citizens\r\nof the county who have made good. He has been a resident of Kansas for\r\nthe past forty-four years, and during that time has worked his way\r\nupward by his own unaided efforts and is now the owner of 350 acres of\r\ngood Kansas soil. Of late he has practically retired from active\r\nfarming, and has rented out his land, that he may be able to take a well\r\nearned repose and enjoy a life of leisure.\r\n\r\nRobert L. Grimes was born February 11, 1852, in Fayette county,\r\nPennsylvania, a son of James and Margaret (Laughlin) Grimes, both of\r\nwhom were born and reared in that county. The father was born May 1,\r\n1824, and was the son of Henry and Sallie Grimes, who came of old\r\npioneer stock in the Keystone State, and were of Scotch and German\r\ndescent. Henry was a blacksmith and made a good living for his family.\r\nJames Grimes was reared in his native county, and when he grew up became\r\na farmer. He tilled the soil in Pennsylvania until 1871, and then\r\ndisposed of his holdings, and migrated westward, to Kansas, investing\r\nhis cash capital in Lancaster township, where he bought 160 acres,\r\nlocated in sections 15, 5 and 18, Atchison county. There were little or\r\nno improvements on his land when he bought it, but with characteristic\r\nthrift, he improved the land and made it into a desirable place of\r\nresidence. Like others who came to the county in that early day he went\r\nthrough the “grasshopper era,” and was discouraged for a time but held\r\non, and as a result became fairly well to do in the course of time, as\r\nbetter years followed the lean era. He lived on his farm until his\r\ndemise in 1905, and at the time of his death was one of the well\r\nrespected and best known citizens of his township. Grimes, senior, was\r\nmarried in Fayette county, Pennsylvania, to Margaret A. Laughlin, and\r\nthis marriage was blessed by the following children: Robert Laughlin,\r\nsubject of this sketch; William, a farmer of Lancaster township;\r\nElizabeth, deceased; John A., Huron, Kan.; Mrs. Sallie Hardin, Lancaster\r\ntownship, and Hugh L., Lancaster township. The mother of the foregoing\r\nchildren was born February 12, 1828, and departed this life in 1901. She\r\nleft the impress of a noble and womanly character upon the lives of her\r\nchildren, who have all led exemplary lives and been a credit to their\r\nparents. She was a daughter of Robert Laughlin, a farmer of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nRobert L., with whom this review is directly concerned, was reared to\r\nyoung manhood on the family farm in Fayette county, Pennsylvania,\r\nreceived his early education in the nearby district school, and at the\r\nage of nineteen years accompanied his parents to the new home in this\r\ncounty. His first schooling was obtained in the Mt. Vernon district in\r\nhis native county, and he also attended the school near his new home in\r\nLancaster township, when not assisting his father in developing their\r\nKansas farm. He remained on the home farm until he was twenty-seven\r\nyears of age, and after his marriage, he launched into agricultural\r\npursuits for himself by renting a tract of land for two years. His first\r\nefforts in his own behalf were successful and he then used his savings\r\nto purchase a tract of land in Lancaster township, south of Eden. His\r\nfirst investment was in a farm of 160 acres, which he improved as his\r\nprosperity continued to increase. By the exercise of industry, self-\r\ndenial and good financial management, he has become the owner of 350\r\nacres of fine land. This land has twenty-five acres of standing timber,\r\nwhich is a valuable asset when one considers that timber is almost a\r\nrarity in the greater part of Kansas. Mr. Grimes cultivated his land\r\nuntil 1914, when he decided to shift some of the burden which grew heavy\r\nas he felt himself taking on added years, and he accordingly rented it,\r\nbut retains the supervision of the farm.\r\n\r\nFor several years Mr. Grimes has been a breeder of Shorthorn cattle, and\r\ntakes considerable interest in his fine stock. His success in farming is\r\ndue to the fact that he has not been content to just be an ordinary\r\nfarmer, but has endeavored to keep abreast of the latest developments in\r\nagriculture and has aimed to keep the best of live stock on his place.\r\nHe has an excellent barn, 32×60 feet in dimension, with a capacity of\r\neighty tons of hay, and which cost over $1,500, despite the fact that\r\nmost of the lumber used in its construction was cut and sawed from the\r\ntimber on his place.\r\n\r\nMr. Grimes was married April 16, 1879, to Miss Viola Wilson, who has\r\nborne him two children: Mrs. Edith Shufflebarger, living on a farm in\r\nLancaster township, and Mrs. Franketta Carson, whose husband is farming\r\nthe Grimes farm land. Mrs. Grimes was born in Lancaster township,\r\nDecember 21, 1862, and is a daughter of Andrew and Nancy (Carpenter)\r\nWilson, who came to Atchison county from Kentucky in the early pioneer\r\ndays. Andrew Wilson was a Union veteran who saw valiant service during\r\nthe Civil war.\r\n\r\nIn political matters Mr. Grimes has always been identified with the\r\nDemocratic party, and has served as a member of the school board in his\r\ntownship. He attends religious services at the Methodist Episcopal\r\nchurch, and is a member of the Modern Woodmen of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHRIST KANNING.\r\n\r\nThe proverbial success of the members of the German race, who have left\r\nthe Fatherland in search of fortune in America, is well illustrated in\r\nreviewing the career of Christ Kanning, of Lancaster township, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas. In a little more than a score of years, beginning with\r\npractically no capital, Mr. Kanning has accumulated 240 acres of the\r\nbest land in Atchison county. He is the owner of two well improved\r\nfarms, and it was necessary for him to build practically all of the\r\nimprovements on his home place since purchasing the land in 1893.\r\n\r\nChrist Kanning was born in Westphalia, a province of Prussia in the\r\nGerman Empire, May 20, 1854. He is a son of Henry and Christena (Poos)\r\nKanning, who were the parents of seven children, three of whom are\r\ndeceased. The parents spent their lives in the Fatherland. Christ\r\nKanning is the only member of the family living in Atchison county; two\r\nof the children live in Germany, and the other resides in Illinois.\r\nChrist received eight years of schooling in his native land, became a\r\nfarmer in Westphalia, and in 1889 left the old home and immigrated to\r\nMadison county, Illinois, where he worked as a farm hand four years. In\r\n1893 he migrated westward, to Atchison county, and with his savings\r\nbought eighty acres of land in section 24, Lancaster township. This\r\ntract was improved at the time of purchase, but Christ, in keeping with\r\nthe policy of his neighbors and the other enterprising farmers of this\r\nnoted township, was not satisfied with the buildings, and has\r\npractically replaced all the original improvements with residence and\r\nbarns more in keeping with his ambition and prosperity. He has erected a\r\nlarge, eight-room residence, and a barn 40×46 feet, a granary, and a\r\nlarge windmill which pumps the water for his home and live stock. The\r\nHarry Searls place, which he also owns, is a very well improved farm,\r\nand is located just one-half mile east of the home farm of Mr. Kanning.\r\nIt is a well kept modern place. Mr. Kanning keeps graded stock on his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nMr. Kanning was married February 29, 1888, to Caroline Stahlhut, and\r\nthis marriage has been blessed with seven children, namely: Henry,\r\ndeceased; Mrs. Christina Poos, Benton township; Mrs. Mary W. Poos,\r\nBenton township; Bertha, Otto, William, and Ada, all of whom are at home\r\nwith their parents. Mrs. Kanning was born April 27, 1869, in Madison\r\ncounty, Illinois, and is a daughter of Henry and Mary (Debtner)\r\nStahlhut, both of whom were natives of Germany, immigrating to America\r\nand settling in Madison county, Illinois, where they died. Mr. Kanning\r\nis one of those citizens who believe in doing their own thinking in\r\npolitical affairs, and is not allied with any political party, voting\r\nfor the man, regardless of his politics, and making up his own mind as\r\nto each candidate’s personal fitness to ably perform the duties of the\r\noffice sought. He and his family are members of the German Lutheran\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THEO INTFEN.\r\n\r\nTheo Intfen has been a resident of Atchison county for over half a\r\ncentury. He has seen the county transformed from a wilderness and\r\nunbroken prairie to a land of fertile farms and thriving cities and\r\ntowns. Practically all of his life has been spent within sight of, or\r\nwithin, Atchison, and he has witnessed and taken part in the wonderful\r\ngrowth of his home city. Nearly thirty years of his life have been spent\r\nin building up the immense furniture and house furnishing business now\r\nlocated in his own building at 623–625 Commercial street. This business\r\nhad its initial beginning in 1887 in the old Municipal theater building,\r\nunder the firm name of Miller & Intfen. In 1890 the store was moved to\r\nthe west half of the Ramsey building, where it remained under Mr.\r\nIntfen’s management until November 25, 1912, when it was removed to the\r\npresent quarters. Mr. Intfen purchased the building and thoroughly\r\nremodeled it, erecting a new and modern front, and building an addition\r\non the rear, 50×150 feet. A stock worth over $40,000 is carried on three\r\nfloors and the basement. An immense credit business is handled in a\r\nsuccessful manner, and nine men are employed by Mr. Intfen in the caring\r\nfor the trade. Goods from the Intfen store are sold over a wide range of\r\nterritory, the store having patrons located in Tennessee, Iowa, Florida,\r\nPhilippine Islands, the Dakotas, Arkansas, Nebraska, Oregon, Illinois,\r\nMichigan, Oklahoma, and other states. He does an extensive business in\r\nKansas and Missouri, and cares for a great many orders received from a\r\ndistance. During the year of 1913 he made over 757 shipments from\r\nAtchison to distant railway points. Mr. Intfen is an extensive\r\nadvertiser and believes in publicity for a healthy, growing concern such\r\nas he has built up.\r\n\r\nTheo Intfen was born December 24, 1861, in Weston, Mo., and is a son of\r\nWilliam and Mary (Piekman) Intfen, of Prussia. The Intfen home was just\r\nacross the Holland-Prussian line. William Intfen and his wife immigrated\r\nto America in 1853 and made their first home for a number of years at\r\nWeston, Mo. In October, 1862, they crossed the Missouri river by means\r\nof a ferry and located on a farm, two and one-half miles north of\r\nAtchison. The elder Intfen developed his farm and reared a family. At\r\nthis time there were not many settlers in Atchison county, and the city\r\nwas but a village. The first store of the town was then doing business,\r\nand Theo Intfen can recall its appearance. Large trees stood on the site\r\nof many of the present business blocks. William Intfen became the owner\r\nof 180 acres of land, and was a prosperous farmer for those days. Mrs.\r\nIntfen died on the home farm in 1885. William Intfen came to Atchison\r\nafter her death and died in 1901, at a ripe old age. Five children were\r\nborn to them, namely: John J., a merchant of Atchison; Theo, the subject\r\nof this sketch; Mrs. Minnie Miller, living at 714 Laramie street; Mrs.\r\nAnna Falk, of Andale, Kan.; Henry died at the age of two years.\r\n\r\nTheo Intfen was reared on the pioneer farm and attended the district\r\nschool in his neighborhood. He assisted his father on the home place\r\nuntil he attained his majority, and then decided to do things for\r\nhimself. He went to Kanopolis, Eldridge county, Kansas, and opened the\r\nfirst store in the town. He sold sixty-two dollars’ worth of merchandise\r\nthe first day he arrived from boxes in the street before getting into\r\nthe store. He placed the first stock of goods in Kanopolis, and made the\r\nfirst sale of merchandise in the town. One year after establishing this\r\nstore he sold out at a nice profit and returned to Atchison, where he\r\nengaged in the furniture business, as before stated. His success has\r\nbeen due to pronounced ability as a salesman, and his excellent judgment\r\nin financial affairs, and a knowledge of what the people will buy, and\r\nthe carrying out of his plan to supply patrons on the credit plan, which\r\nis optional with the customer.\r\n\r\nMr. Intfen was married in 1893 to Miss Emma Zibold, and to this union\r\nhas been born a daughter, Louise, born September 29, 1894, educated in\r\nAtchison and graduated from the Atchison Business College. From 1912\r\nuntil her marriage she was her father’s bookkeeper. She was married on\r\nOctober 17, 1915, to LeRoy A. Osterbog, in charge of cost department of\r\nthe Atchison Saddlery Company. Mrs. Intfen is a daughter of Merman\r\nZibold, a native of Germany, who first settled in St. Louis, then lived\r\nin St. Joseph, and from there came to Atchison.\r\n\r\nMr. Intfen is an independent Democrat, politically, and does his own\r\nthinking as to what candidates he will support for office, when it is\r\ntime for him to cast his ballots. While interested in good government,\r\nhe does not take an active part in political affairs. He is strictly a\r\nbusiness man, who has built up a monument to his own individual\r\nenterprise and energy through the development of the large Intfen store.\r\nHe is likewise interested in his home city and takes a just pride in the\r\nfact that he has done his share to assist the development of Atchison,\r\nand is proud of the knowledge that he has witnessed the growth of a\r\nbeautiful and prosperous city from its very beginning. He is a member of\r\nSt. Benedict’s Catholic Church, and is affiliated with the Modern\r\nWoodmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THOMAS FINNEGAN.\r\n\r\nThomas Finnegan, an Atchison county pioneer, who came to this county\r\nforty-eight years ago, is a successful farmer of Shannon township, and\r\nhas resided on his present place for forty years. Thomas Finnegan is a\r\nnative of Ireland, born in 1842, and is a son of Patrick and Hanora\r\nFinnegan. The father died when Thomas was less than a year old, and the\r\nmother came to this country, and died in Atchison county, at the home of\r\nher son, Thomas, in 1899, at the remarkably advanced age of 102 years.\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Finnegan immigrated to America, he first settled in\r\nConnecticut, where he remained for five years. He then went to Iowa,\r\nremaining in that State for fifteen years. While living in Iowa he\r\nworked out by the month a great deal and often worked for as low as\r\neight dollars per month. In March, 1867, he came to Kansas, and after\r\nspending a short time in Atchison county, removed to Doniphan county,\r\nand for about two years worked at breaking prairie land with ox teams.\r\nHe followed farming about two years in Doniphan county, and was also\r\ninterested in a threshing outfit, which he operated for a time, and in\r\n1870 he returned to Atchison county, and in 1871 bought 160 acres of\r\nland in Shannon township, where he has since been engaged in farming and\r\nhas met with uniform success. He has one of the best farms in Atchison\r\ncounty, under an excellent state of cultivation, with a large producing\r\norchard. Mr. Finnegan is a great lover of trees and timber, and in the\r\nearly days in Kansas planted a great many trees, and now has a fine\r\ngrove on his place, with many large maple, elm and walnut trees, as well\r\nas cottonwood, which adds greatly to the appearance of his place.\r\n\r\nDuring the war Mr. Finnegan was employed as a Government teamster, and\r\nin 1863 he drove transfer teams in St. Louis. He was married in 1869 to\r\nMiss Anne Morley, a native of Ireland, born in 1850. The following\r\nchildren have been born to Mr. and Mrs. Finnegan: Nora married J. J.\r\nSlattery, Shannon township; John resides in Atchison; Mary married\r\nJoseph Schlesbaum, Atchison; Thomas, Houston, Tex.; James resides in\r\nCalifornia; Margaret married Joseph Longan, Doniphan county; Agatha\r\nresides at home, and Roger, farmer, Atchison county. Mr. Finnegan leans\r\nto independence in politics, and the family are members of the Catholic\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SAMUEL E. BALLINGER.\r\n\r\nAdjoining Atchison, to the westward there are many beautiful and well\r\nkept suburban homes. Along the road which borders Forest park on the\r\nwest are some especially fine homes with well kept grounds, dotted with\r\nflowers and shrubbery, in striking contrast to the unkempt condition of\r\nthe park upon which these suburban estates front. These homes make ideal\r\nplaces for people who have spent the greater part of their lives in\r\nfarming pursuits, and, while wishing to be near the city, yet wish to\r\nhave a larger space for a home setting than the thickly settled parts of\r\nthe town would afford. In one of the beautiful homes fronting the\r\nhighway resides Samuel E. Ballinger and his faithful wife and helpmeet,\r\nwho have been residents of Atchison county for many years and are both\r\ndescendants of old eastern families.\r\n\r\nSamuel E. Ballinger was born September 7, 1843, in Salem county, New\r\nJersey, a son of John G. and Sarah Ann (Reeves) Ballinger. His paternal\r\ngrandfather was also named John G., who married a Quaker lady. His\r\nmaternal grandfather was Stephen Reeves, a scion of an old eastern\r\nfamily, and in his day a leading ship builder of New Jersey. The father\r\nof Samuel E. was born in 1827 and died in 1906. During his life he was a\r\nmiller and farmer and prominent in the affairs of Salem county, New\r\nJersey. He was twice married, his first wife, Sarah Ann, dying in 1850,\r\nleaving three children: Stephen R., a retired miller of New Jersey, now\r\ndeceased; Samuel E., and Thomas E., residing in Atchison. John G.\r\nBallinger’s second wife was Sarah Austin, who bore him the following\r\nchildren: John, Charles, Walter, Ella, Gertrude, Emma, and Minnie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _S. E. Ballinger._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. S. E. Ballinger._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSamuel E. received his education in the public schools of his native\r\ncounty and State and early learned to perform his share of the work\r\nrequired in the operation of his father’s gristmill and farm. He hauled\r\ngrist from the mill to town and to the patrons of his father’s mill and\r\nassisted in cultivating his father’s farm when yet a boy in years. When\r\nhe attained young manhood he was associated with his father in the\r\nlivery and feed business at Camden, N. J., for a period of three years.\r\nHe and his brother, Stephen, then bought the gristmill which they\r\noperated in partnership until 1871, following which he farmed for one\r\nyear and then disposed of all of his holdings with the intention of\r\nmigrating to Kansas. He came to Atchison, Kan., with a capital of $350\r\nwhich he invested in eighty acres of improved land, costing him $2,400.\r\nThis land was but partly improved, with a modest home of two rooms and a\r\nlean-to at the rear. He and his good wife by dint of economy and\r\nperseverance soon managed to pay off their indebtedness and to erect a\r\nrather pretentious dwelling, at the same time increasing their land\r\nholdings. Their first purchase was an eighty acre tract near the home\r\nfarm, and they later bought a tract of 160 acres near Huron in Lancaster\r\ntownship, which they later traded for eighty acres near Shannon. Mr.\r\nBallinger was the possessor at one time of 240 acres of well improved\r\nland. As age crept upon this worthy couple they gradually disposed of\r\ntheir land holdings until they retained but forty acres of the home\r\nplace, and they moved to Atchison in September of 1907, where they\r\ninvested in a beautiful suburban estate of five acres. Later, when they\r\ndisposed of the forty acre farm they added ten acres to the suburban\r\ntract which has since become very valuable on account of its nearness to\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nMr. Ballinger was married September 7, 1870, to Janie Louise Paxson, and\r\nto this union have been born children, as follows: Mrs. Evelina\r\nLancaster, of Severance, Kan., who is the mother of six children,\r\nnamely: Samuel E., Sarah Catharine, William Andrew, Fred, Harry and\r\nLeonard: Mrs. Sarah Elizabeth Yaple, of Atchison, mother of children as\r\nfollows: Albert, Louise, Ruth, Esther (deceased), John, Edwin, Austin,\r\nRaymond, and Ernest, and twin boys, Harold Paxson and Herbert Ballinger.\r\nThe mother of these children, Jane Louise (Paxson) Ballinger, was born\r\nDecember 2, 1844, in the city of Philadelphia, daughter of Samuel W. and\r\nCatharine (Speer) Paxson. Her father was the son of Irish parents and\r\nher mother was born of German parentage. Samuel W. was a carpenter by\r\ntrade who was married in Camden, N. J., and plied his trade in that\r\nvicinity for many years. He served in behalf of the Union during the\r\nCivil war in a Pennsylvania regiment of volunteers. A brother, Henry,\r\nserved in the Tenth regiment of New Jersey volunteer infantry.\r\n\r\nMr. Ballinger has always been a Republican in politics, but has never\r\ntaken an active part in political matters. He is a member of the Central\r\nProtective Association. He is essentially a home man and takes a pride\r\nin keeping his attractive home in excellent condition, and can be seen\r\nmost any day working about the grounds surrounding the Ballinger home.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Ballinger are a worthy couple, kind and indulgent with\r\ntheir children whom they have endeavored to rear so that they might lead\r\nupright and worthy lives in the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CHARLES WILLIAM ROBINSON.\r\n\r\nCharles William Robinson, county physician of Atchison county, assistant\r\nsurgeon for the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, and one of the\r\nprominent and successful members of the medical profession in\r\nnortheastern Kansas, is a native son of the Sunflower State and was born\r\non his father’s farm in Noble township, Marshall county, March 1, 1890,\r\na son of William F. and Mary (Critchfield) Robinson. His parents were\r\nborn in Buchanan county, Missouri, his father in 1853, and his mother in\r\n1857. William F. Robinson became a resident of Kansas in the seventies,\r\nlocating in Marshall county, where he engaged in farming and stock\r\nraising. He is one of the extensive land owners of that county, his\r\nproperties exceeding 1,200 acres. He has been actively identified with\r\nthe development of his section, is one of his county’s most influential\r\ncitizens, and has attained a secure position in its commercial, social\r\nand political life. Mr. Robinson has been married twice. Two children,\r\nJames M. Robinson, M. D., of Hiawatha, Kan: and Lucille, now Mrs. Dr. A.\r\nE. Ricks, of Atchison, were born of the first marriage. Our subject, Dr.\r\nCharles W. Robinson, is the only child of the second marriage.\r\n\r\nDr. Robinson received his early educational discipline in the public\r\nschools of his native county, supplemented by a course in the Hiawatha\r\nAcademy. He subsequently completed a course in Washburn College, Topeka,\r\nand then entered the medical department of Kansas University, from which\r\nhe was graduated with the degree of Doctor of Medicine, a member of the\r\nclass of 1913. Following his graduation, he located for practice in the\r\ncity of Atchison, where he formed a partnership with Dr. C. A. Lilly.\r\nShortly after engaging in the practice of his profession, he was\r\nappointed county physician, an unusual honor for a practitioner to\r\nreceive during his first year of practice. That he has filled the office\r\nwith credit is attested by his having been re-appointed in 1914, and\r\nagain in 1915. Dr. Robinson has built up a very lucrative practice and\r\nis recognized as one of the most able of the younger members of the\r\nmedical profession in his section of the State. The demands of his\r\npractice have not caused him to forego his habit of study. He keeps\r\nabreast of the advancement in medicine and surgery, and during the\r\nwinter of 1914–15 completed a post-graduate course in diseases of\r\nchildren at the Nursery and Child’s Hospital, New York City. He is a\r\nmember of the Atchison County Medical Society, the Kansas State, and the\r\nAmerican Medical Associations. He is also a member of Orient Lodge, No.\r\n57, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, of Topeka; Atchison Lodge, No.\r\n647, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks; Atchison Aerie, No. 173,\r\nFraternal Order of Eagles, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, Royal\r\nArcanum, Fraternal Aid, Kansas Fraternal Citizens, Homesteaders, Yeoman\r\nof America, and Ancient Order of United Workmen.\r\n\r\nSince becoming a citizen of Atchison, Dr. Robinson has taken an active\r\ninterest in those measures and projects which have had for their object\r\nthe betterment and development of the city. He also finds time to take\r\nan active part in its social life. Dr. Robinson is unmarried.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN McINTEER.\r\n\r\nJohn McInteer was a builder who had an abiding faith in the eventual\r\ndevelopment of the West. He was a pioneer citizen of Atchison, and a\r\nprominent figure in the city for over forty-five years, and had an\r\nintimate acquaintance with the sturdy characters who had much to do with\r\nthe development of the Sunflower State. He came to Atchison in the days\r\nwhen the great wagon trains left in a continuous, and often unbroken,\r\nstream for the Far West with their valuable cargoes of freight. So great\r\nwas his confidence in the ultimate growth of his adopted city that he\r\ninvested his savings in real property, built of brick and stone, which\r\nare still standing in the city. The handsome McInteer block on\r\nCommercial street is a monument to his enterprise and faith in the\r\ngrowth of the city. Mr. McInteer was well and favorably known among the\r\ncoterie of famous men who have cast luster upon Atchison and the State\r\nof Kansas. He was a consistent and unremitting booster for his home city\r\nand State, and the substantial fortune and good name which he left\r\nbehind prove his judgment and business acumen to have been sound and\r\nessentially correct.\r\n\r\nMr. McInteer was born in Donegal, Ireland, in 1827, and immigrated to\r\nAmerica alone when a boy. He had heard of the wonders of the new land\r\nacross the ocean, and dreamed of one day sailing across the waters of\r\nthe broad Atlantic to the land of the free, there to seek his fortune.\r\nHow his dream came true is told in the succeeding paragraphs. His first\r\nemployment was in Philadelphia as a laborer. Opportunity did not seem to\r\nbeckon to him in the “City of Brotherly Love” sufficient to hold him,\r\nhowever, and he turned his face still farther to the westward, going to\r\nthe newer State of Indiana, where he learned the trade of harness maker.\r\nHe first started a business of his own in Jeffersonville, Ind. While\r\nbusily engaged in this Ohio river town in plying his trade with a fair\r\nmodicum of success, he heard of the opening up of the vast stretches of\r\nland west of the Missouri river. His Celtic imagination was still\r\nworking and he pictured to himself the possibilities of realizing his\r\nambitions in one of the new cities of Kansas. His decision was soon\r\nmade; he heeded the famous Greeley’s advice, “Go West, young man, go\r\nWest, and grow up with the country.” Accordingly, he sold out his little\r\nshop and started for Omaha. On the way up the Missouri river his wife\r\nwas taken ill and he changed his plans to the extent of stopping in\r\nDoniphan county, Kansas, and taking up a homestead. One year later he\r\ntraded his claim for a lot at Eighth and Commercial streets in Atchison.\r\nUpon this lot he built a small shop, where he again began the\r\nmanufacture of harness and saddles. For several years he supplied the\r\ngreat overland trains which passed to the Far West. His trade grew and\r\nhe was compelled to enlarge his quarters and engaged in the manufacture\r\nof harness and saddles on an extensive scale. As he prospered and\r\naccumulated capital he erected buildings and invested in real estate in\r\nAtchison and the nearby city of St. Joseph. He also erected a modern\r\nbrick residence where his widow now lives. He died July 17, 1901.\r\n\r\nHe was twice married, his first wife being Alice Conley, who died in\r\n1892 without issue. In 1895 he married Mrs. Anna (Conlon) Donovan, of\r\nMontreal, Canada, whose parents, James and Anna Conlon, were well known\r\ncitizens of Atchison, and whose personal history will be found in the\r\nbiography of Charles J. Conlon, brother of Mrs. McInteer. Mrs. McInteer\r\nwas reared in Atchison, returned to New York with her parents, and was\r\nthere married to Peter Donovan, who was a customs officer under the\r\nCanadian Government at Montreal. He died in Montreal in 1891. Three sons\r\nwere born of this marriage: Peter Donovan, a widely known journalist, of\r\nToronto, now a contributor to the _Toronto Saturday Night_; Fred, in the\r\ninsurance and real estate business in Atchison; Charles, a farmer and\r\nstockman, residing with his mother.\r\n\r\nMr. McInteer was a member of the Catholic church, and a liberal\r\ncontributor to his own and other religious denominations. He was one of\r\nthose big-hearted, whole-souled gentlemen, who was a friend to all, and\r\nwho was highly regarded for his many excellent qualities of heart and\r\nmind. He was independent in politics. The foregoing brief review is thus\r\ncontributed to the history of Atchison county in order that it be placed\r\non record for all time, and perchance, prove an inspiration for other\r\nyoung men, poor in purse, whose destiny is yet to be worked out, and who\r\nprobably dream of accumulating wealth or a competence in their\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HENRY HANSON LOUDENBACK.\r\n\r\nA review of the educational institutions of Atchison county would be\r\nincomplete without mention being made of the Loudenback School of Music.\r\nIt is probable that no institution within the borders of the State of\r\nKansas has had a more rapid, substantial and satisfactory growth than\r\nhas the school under the direct supervision and management of Professor\r\nLoudenback. Established in 1912 as a school of piano and theory,\r\nenlarged in 1913, and incorporated in 1914, it is now authorized by the\r\nState to issue diplomas and certificates. It is rapidly building an\r\nenviable reputation for thoroughness of instruction, having graduated\r\npupils who are conceded to be artists of recognized ability, and its\r\nimportance as an educational institution of the highest grade is\r\nappreciated by the residents of its home city.\r\n\r\nHenry Hanson Loudenback, founder and principal of the Loudenback School\r\nof Music, was born in a log cabin on his father’s farm in Hancock\r\ncounty, Indiana (the county seat, Greenfield, being the birthplace of\r\nJames Whitcomb Riley), March 17, 1879, a son of Daniel and Margaret\r\n(McCray) Loudenback. His paternal grandparents were Henry Loudenback, a\r\nnative of Pennsylvania, who came to Hancock county, Indiana, in 1836,\r\none of the early pioneers of that section, and Elizabeth Brown, a native\r\nof Virginia, of German ancestry. Daniel Loudenback was born in Hancock\r\ncounty in 1846 and reared in a district which at that time was almost a\r\nwilderness. Splitting rails was an occupation which took up a good\r\nportion of his time. With his father, he settled on a farm about three\r\nmiles from Charlottesville. This property they developed into a highly\r\nproductive farm. Henry Loudenback died in 1905. Daniel engaged in\r\nbusiness in Charlottesville in 1882, and in 1883 established a store at\r\nWilkinson, which he conducted until his death, in 1888. He had married,\r\nwhen a young man, Margaret McCray, now a resident of Wilkinson, who\r\nsurvives him. They were the parents of two children: Henry Hanson, the\r\nsubject of this review, and Allie Almeda Cook, of Wilkinson, Ind.\r\n\r\nHenry Hanson Loudenback received his educational discipline in the\r\npublic schools of his native State, and in 1898 came to Kansas and\r\njoined relatives who resided near Centralia. He became a teacher in the\r\ncountry schools, and later spent one year teaching music, going from\r\nplace to place on horseback. From early childhood he had given evidence\r\nof remarkable musical ability, and had sung in public when only four\r\nyears of age. After learning harmonies from his sister, he began to\r\nimprovise his own melodies, and to harmonize them upon the reed organ.\r\nHis first real lessons were taken when thirteen years of age. In the\r\nfall of 1901 he entered Campbell University at Holton, Kan., and was\r\ngraduated from that institution, in music, in 1902. Since receiving his\r\ndegree from Campbell College he has studied piano, harmony and\r\ncomposition with the best teachers of these subjects in America, his\r\ntraining being under such noted musicians as Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler,\r\nof Chicago, the world’s greatest woman pianist; Mr. and Mrs. A. K.\r\nVirgil, of New York City; Peter C. Lutkin and Arne Oldberg, of\r\nNorthwestern University, at Evanston; and Allen Spencer, of the American\r\nConservatory of Music, Chicago. From 1902 until 1906 he was director of\r\nmusic in the Atchison County High School; from 1906 until 1910,\r\nprofessor of music in South Dakota State College of Agriculture and\r\nMechanical Arts; from 1910 until 1912, director of piano, pipe organ,\r\nand musical theory at the Dakota Wesleyan University. In 1912 he founded\r\nthe Loudenback School of Music at Atchison, and since its establishment\r\nhas devoted his entire time to its management and the teaching of piano\r\nand musical theory. He is an accredited teacher of piano and theory by\r\nthe Kansas State Music Teachers’ Association, and was a member of the\r\nexecutive committee of that organization which issued certificates to\r\naccredited teachers in December, 1914, and was appointed a member of the\r\ncommittee on piano standards for 1915, and in December, 1910, was\r\nelected vice-president of that association, and was appointed a member\r\nof the special accrediting committee. He has appeared twice as piano\r\nsoloist with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, and numbers among his\r\nfriends many of the great musicians of the present day.\r\n\r\nProfessor Loudenback married on June 28, 1900, Miss Flora Donald, a\r\ndaughter of George and Christy (Black) Donald, of Centralia, Kan. Her\r\nfather was an early settler and prominent farmer.\r\n\r\nProfessor and Mrs. Loudenback are the parents of the following children:\r\nGeorge Daniel, born November 23, 1901; Allie Mae, born March 12, 1904;\r\nRamona Lolita, born July 25, 1905; Henry, born August 17, 1907; and\r\nDonald, born July 19, 1909. The children have inherited their father’s\r\nlove of music and show talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FRANK P. WERTZ.\r\n\r\nFrank P. Wertz, deputy county clerk of Atchison county, is one of the\r\nprogressive young men of the county. He was born at Parnell, Atchison\r\ncounty, September 2, 1888, and is a son of David M. and Elizabeth\r\nCaroline Wertz, natives of Pennsylvania. They were married in their\r\nnative State and shortly afterwards came West, and located on a farm in\r\nAtchison county, where they have been very successful. David M. Wertz\r\nbegan life with nothing, and by industry and keen foresight has become\r\none of the substantial and well-to-do men of Atchison county. He has\r\nalways taken a commendable interest in the welfare of his community. To\r\nDavid M. Wertz and wife have been born the following children: Frank P.,\r\nthe subject of this sketch; Eva married H. J. Barber, a banker, of\r\nCummings, Kan.; Abraham, a farmer and stockman, Mt. Pleasant, Atchison\r\ncounty; Fredrick, a farmer in Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison county;\r\nRosetta, the wife of Fred C. Voelker, a farmer, of Shannon township,\r\nAtchison county, and Bertha E., who resides at home.\r\n\r\nFrank P. Wertz was reared on the home farm in Atchison county and\r\neducated in the public schools, graduating from the Atchison County High\r\nSchool. He then took a course in the Atchison Business College, and\r\ngraduated in 1909. He then became assistant cashier of the State Bank of\r\nCummings, and remained in that position for two years, when he resigned\r\nto accept his present position. Frank P. Wertz takes a live interest in\r\nthe welfare of the community. He is a member of the Masonic lodge and\r\nthe Ancient Order of United Workmen. He is a popular county official,\r\nand his genial manner and obliging nature, coupled with efficiency and\r\nclose application to the duties of his office, have won for him many\r\nstanch friends and supporters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THOMAS L. CLINE.\r\n\r\nFor sixty years Thomas L. Cline has lived in Mt. Pleasant township,\r\nAtchison county, and he is one of the oldest of Kansas pioneers in point\r\nof years of residence in the State. Coming to this county when he was\r\nten years of age with his parents he has lived to see Kansas become\r\nprosperous and the vast prairie transformed by the hand of man into a\r\ntruly good place to live. He, himself, has risen in the course of time\r\nto become one of the wealthy farmers of the county, and despite his\r\nthree score and ten years of age he still oversees the work on his large\r\nfarm of 320 acres.\r\n\r\nMr. Cline was born October 8, 1845, in Henry county, Iowa, a son of\r\nHenry and Eleanor (Leanord) Cline, both natives of Ohio. The parents of\r\nboth Henry and Eleanor moved at a very early day from Ohio to Illinois,\r\nwhere they were married. The parents of T. L. Cline lived but a short\r\ntime in Illinois and then removed to Henry county, Iowa, where four of\r\nthe children were born, of whom T. L. was the youngest. The family lived\r\nin Iowa for sixteen years and came to Kansas as early as 1855. Henry\r\nsettled on a quarter section of land, which is still in the family, and\r\nis owned by Thomas L., adjoining the quarter section upon which the home\r\nof the subject is located. At the time the Clines located in Atchison\r\ncounty the country was a vast reach of unpeopled prairie broken by belts\r\nof timber along the streams. Prairie fires were very common in those\r\ndays. Henry Cline persuaded a neighbor to preëmpt the adjoining section\r\nto his and eventually bought it and increased his acreage to 480 acres\r\nin all. An interesting feature of the Cline farm is the stone fencing\r\nwhich is built around a portion of the farm. Stone fences are a rarity\r\nin Kansas and are found only in the occasional places where stone is\r\nplentiful, and their building required time and plenty of it on the part\r\nof men who in the early days made the building of stone fences a\r\nvocation and followed it as their method of earning a living. While a\r\nportion of the stone work on the farm has been replaced by wire fencing,\r\n300 rods of this fence are in excellent condition despite the fact that\r\nit was erected over forty-five years ago. T. L. Cline in speaking\r\nreminiscently of the old days recalls that the “grasshopper” visitation\r\nof 1866 was every whit as bad as in the years of 1874 and 1875, and he\r\nalso recalls seeing a company of “red shirts” or border ruffians\r\nencamped near his father’s farm. Henry Cline died in 1875, his widow\r\ndying in 1901 at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Mary E. Blodgett. Henry\r\nand Eleanor Cline reared the following children: Julia Ann (Jay),\r\ndeceased, at Rock Creek, Kan.; Mary E. Blodgett, Walnut township;\r\nCharles W. died in Union service at Drywood, Mo., and Thomas L., the\r\nyoungest.\r\n\r\nT. L. Cline grew up on his father’s farm and has never lived anywhere\r\nelse since he was ten years of age. He was married in 1874 to Miss Susan\r\nVandiver. The following children were born of this marriage: Ora, wife\r\nof Edward Bradley, of Atchison county; Nellie, wife of Martin Decker,\r\nliving in Leavenworth county, Kansas; Charles Cline, farming on the home\r\nplace; T. L., Jr., better known as Lloyd, at home with his parents and\r\nassists in farm work. The mother of these children was born February 11,\r\n1853, in Green county, Wisconsin, a daughter of Edward and Irene\r\n(Holloway) Vandiver, the former a native of Kentucky and the latter of\r\nProvidence, R. I. The respective parents of Edward and Irene Vandiver\r\nremoved from their native states to Illinois, and it was in that State\r\nthat they were married. Shortly after their marriage they moved to\r\nWisconsin and settled on a farm near Monroe, in Green county. They\r\nresided in Wisconsin for sixteen years and then returned to Schuyler\r\ncounty, Illinois. After a residence of ten years in Illinois they came\r\nto Atchison county, Kansas, to make a permanent home. Edward Vandiver\r\nwas a personal friend of Abraham Lincoln and often rode with Lincoln to\r\nand from political gatherings. His political beliefs were the same as\r\nMr. Lincoln’s. Mr. Vandiver was also acquainted with Stephen A. Douglas\r\nand attended the famous Lincoln and Douglas debates.\r\n\r\nFor one year after their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Cline lived at the home\r\nof Mr. Cline’s parents, when T. L. built a home for himself on a part of\r\nthe family estate. After his father’s demise he bought his mother’s\r\ninterest in the estate and moved to the old home place where he still\r\nresides. Mr. Cline has always been a stockman and a large feeder of\r\ncattle and hogs. He is now raising sheep and has about 140 head of these\r\nanimals on his farm. He has always been a stanch Republican, as his\r\nfather was before him, and has usually taken an active part in political\r\nand civic affairs. He served for many years as a member of the school\r\nboard and was succeeded by his son, Charles, as a member of the board\r\nwhen T. L. refused to serve any longer. He was one of the organizers of\r\nthe Farmers State Bank of Potter, Kan., and is generally found in the\r\nforefront of all good movements tending to promote the welfare of the\r\npeople in his neighborhood. Mr. Cline carries his years lightly and can\r\nbe seen almost any day directing the farm work and is very active for\r\nhis years. Thomas L. Cline is one of Atchison county’s grand old men and\r\nis a true Kansas pioneer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ROBERT FORBRIGER.\r\n\r\nIn the present incumbent of the county assessor’s office, the people of\r\nAtchison county are extremely fortunate in having a painstaking,\r\nfaithful and conscientious public servant who believes in doing his duty\r\nby the people, taxpayers, and for the people as the law provides. It is\r\nprobable that no other individual in the county has a wider or more\r\nintimate knowledge of values and property ownership in Atchison county\r\nthan Mr. Forbriger. Born in Atchison county in the pioneer days when the\r\ncounty was in process of early settlement, he has grown up with the city\r\nand county and has a speaking acquaintance with almost every person\r\nwithin the confines of his native heath. Kind and obliging to a high\r\ndegree, he has made himself invaluable as a citizen and able county\r\nofficial, and is well liked and highly esteemed for his many excellent\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nThe father of the gentleman named in the foregoing paragraph was Robert\r\nForbriger, a native of Saxony, Germany, born in 1825, immigrated to\r\nAmerica in 1848 and died in the city of his adoption in 1886. The senior\r\nForbriger was a man of good education, and came of a family of scholars\r\nand educators in his native land. Therefore, he was well equipped to\r\nfight a winning battle for success in the land of his adoption. He first\r\nlocated in Elgin, Ill., and after a residence of ten years in that city,\r\ncame to Atchison in 1858. This thriving and beautiful city was then in\r\nits infancy, and Mr. Forbriger had the distinction of being one of its\r\nforemost citizens and builders in the early days. He obtained a job in\r\nthe J. E. Wagner hardware store, which was situated on the southeast\r\ncorner of Fourth and Commercial streets. Not long afterward he engaged\r\nin the insurance and real estate business and from that drifted into the\r\nbanking business. He, with George Storch and John Belz, established the\r\nGerman Savings Bank, which was later reorganized as the United States\r\nNational Bank. This new organization erected the building at the corner\r\nof Sixth and Commercial streets. Mr. Forbriger was connected with the\r\nbanking concern until his death, after which the institution was again\r\nreorganized. He was active in civic and business affairs in Atchison\r\nduring his long residence here, and was always a booster for his adopted\r\ncity, liberal in his donations and support of public enterprises, and a\r\nbenefactor of churches and charitable enterprises. It is said of him\r\nthat he always generously responded to calls for assistance in the name\r\nof charity, religion or civic betterment of the community. As a citizen\r\nhe did his duty in an official capacity, serving as a member of the city\r\ncouncil and as an active member of the city school board. During the\r\nearly sixties when Atchison was yet a village he served as a member of\r\nthe town council. In addition he served three terms as city assessor.\r\nWhile a Democrat in politics, he was a great admirer and warm personal\r\nfriend of the late Senator Ingalls, and it was the Senator’s custom to\r\nmake his headquarters in Mr. Forbriger’s office while at home, on his\r\nreturn from Washington. This pioneer citizen was a charter member and\r\nofficer of the Turner’s Society, a famous athletic organization in the\r\nearly days. He was reared in the Lutheran faith, but was broadly\r\ntolerant of all creeds and religious beliefs. It was only natural that\r\nhe should have been a charter member of the Atchison Masonic lodge, and\r\nthe Independent Order of Odd Fellows. During the Civil war he was\r\nenrolled as a member of the State militia, and responded to the call for\r\nvolunteers to repel Price’s invasion and served in Colonel Quigg’s\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nRobert Forbriger, the elder, was married in 1862 to Helen Geier, born in\r\nLimbach, Baden, Germany, and died in Atchison. She came from her native\r\nland to Philadelphia with a sister and cousin, and from there journeyed\r\nto Atchison. To them were born three children as follows: Robert, of\r\nthis review; Emil, engaged in business in East Atchison; Bertha, wife of\r\nM. Noll, druggist of Atchison.\r\n\r\nRobert Forbriger, the son, was educated in the public schools and St.\r\nBenedict’s College. He then entered his father’s bank and also engaged\r\nin the insurance business. After his father’s death he continued in the\r\ninsurance business for a number of years, until he began his service as\r\npostoffice clerk, during Cleveland’s administration. After four years in\r\nthe mercantile business he filled the office of deputy register of deeds\r\nfor four years; served three years as deputy county assessor, and was\r\nelected to the office of county assessor in 1912, and again elected or\r\nappointed to the office by the board of county commissioners in 1914. In\r\nhis younger days he served several years as a regular fireman under\r\nthree successive fire chiefs, and two terms as city councilman. While\r\noriginally a Democrat, he deserted the party in 1896, as many others\r\ndid, to follow the teachings of William McKinley, and now takes an\r\nactive part in Republican politics, and is sincere and active in his\r\nwork in behalf of the candidates of his party. Having been born in\r\nAtchison, April 4, 1863, it is only natural that he should gather for\r\nhis sustenance some of the needful in the way of property, and is the\r\nowner of a fine fruit farm of twenty-eight acres near the city, and in\r\naddition has five residence properties in the city, with properties in\r\nOklahoma and Seattle, Wash.\r\n\r\nMr. Forbriger was married May 21, 1888, to Carrie Wagner, and to them\r\nhave been born two children: Helen, wife of Leo T. Markey, a banker of\r\nGreeley, Kan.; Ralph, a student of electrical engineering in the\r\nMississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College, at Starkville, Miss.\r\nThe mother of these children was born at Port Washington, near\r\nMilwaukee, and is a daughter of Henry and Rosa Wagner, natives of\r\nGermany, who removed from Milwaukee to Atchison where Henry Wagner\r\nbecame a bridge contractor and builder. Mr. Wagner for a long period of\r\nyears did practically all of the bridge construction work in Atchison\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nMr. Forbriger is a member of St. Benedict’s Catholic Church, and is\r\nbroad and tolerant in his religious views, taking the staple ground that\r\nthe manner of life a man lives, regardless of his religious belief,\r\ndetermines his salvation. He is affiliated with the Modern Woodmen, the\r\nAncient Order of United Workmen, the Fraternal Citizens, and the Modern\r\nBrotherhood of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HIRAM H. HACKNEY.\r\n\r\nThe measure of a man’s real worth to a community determines his standing\r\nand niche in the local hall of fame. While several things may be summed\r\nup in the final reckoning as to what constitutes a really useful\r\ncitizen, his service to his fellow citizens in furthering institutions\r\nwhich are of the greatest benefit to the greatest number takes\r\nprecedence over wealth, business ability, political success, or any\r\naccomplishments which have a tendency to place the individual ahead of\r\nhis fellow men. No greater service to a city can be rendered than by the\r\nbuilding up of a modern, progressive public school system. He who\r\nfurthers the cause of education in a practical manner and takes a keen\r\ninterest in the success of the city’s educational systems, as an\r\nunselfish task, befitting his citizenship, is entitled to an everlasting\r\nplace in the hearts and minds of his fellow citizens. The public school\r\nsystem of Atchison is a monument to the labors of Hiram H. Hackney, and\r\nhis fellow members of the board of education during the eight years\r\nwhile Mr. Hackney served as president of the board.\r\n\r\nHiram H. Hackney is a native of Fayette county, Pennsylvania, born near\r\nUniontown, November 30, 1859. He is a son of Hiram H. and Elizabeth\r\n(Wyley) Hackney, both natives of Pennsylvania. The Hackney family in\r\nAmerica came originally from the town of Hackney, England, now a part of\r\nthe city of London, in the early part of the seventeenth century. Hiram\r\nH., the elder, was born in 1822, and died in 1899. He was the son of\r\nJohn Hackney, born in 1776, and lived on the original homestead of the\r\nHackneys, who were Quaker followers of William Penn. Elizabeth Wyley was\r\nborn in 1830, a daughter of Jacob and Hannah Way Wyley, members of an\r\nold colonial family of Irish descent. Hiram H., Sr., was a resident of\r\nUniontown in his old age, and was the last surviving member of the board\r\nof directors, chartering the First National Bank of Uniontown. He was\r\nwell to do and invested some of his funds in the West, becoming one of\r\nthe original stockholders of the First National Bank of Atchison. He was\r\nalso a “Forty Niner,” going overland to the gold fields of California in\r\n1848, with a train of fortune hunters who outfitted at St. Louis and\r\nfought continually with the Indians on the trip across the plains and\r\nmountains. He engaged in the mercantile business at Sacramento and\r\nMarysville, Cal., for a period of two years. He returned home by way of\r\nCape Horn, but made another trip before settling down to the pursuit of\r\nfarming and business in his native State. His brother, Samuel, died of\r\nmountain fever while engaged in mining in the gold fields of California.\r\nMr. Hackney became an extensive farmer, stockman and banker, and\r\nprospered exceedingly. He was known as a solid Quaker citizen “whose\r\nword was as good as his note.” Of his five children, four are living as\r\nfollows: Mrs. Edward G. Hudson, of Newton, Kan.; Edgar S., of Uniontown:\r\nDr. Jacob S., a practitioner in Uniontown, and Francis, who died in\r\nPittsburgh.\r\n\r\nHiram H. Hackney, of Atchison, was educated in the State Normal School\r\nat California, Penn., and Duff’s Mercantile College, Pittsburgh. He did\r\nfarm work while a youth, and taught school for two years. His father\r\nhaving purchased an interest in the First National Bank of this city he\r\ncame here in 1881 and served as assistant cashier and director of the\r\nbank until 1910. He then sold his holdings and retired from banking\r\npursuits on account of ill health, due to long years of close\r\nconfinement to his duties. He then established a real estate, insurance,\r\nbond and loan business which he is now conducting with success. Mr.\r\nHackney is interested in Atchison real estate, and coal lands in\r\nPennsylvania, and is vice-president of the Blair Milling Company of\r\nAtchison.\r\n\r\nIn politics he is a Republican, and the only office he has ever held has\r\nbeen that of member of the board of education, from the presidency of\r\nwhich body he has only recently retired. Of his services on behalf of\r\nthe public schools during his sixteen years’ membership on the board.\r\n_The Atchison Globe_ said: “H. H. Hackney retired last night as a member\r\nof the school board and that board has lost its most useful member for\r\nat least two reasons: Mr. Hackney had the ability to handle the school\r\nfinances and the time necessary to accomplish the things the board laid\r\nout. In addition he possessed an ambition to establish a system of\r\nschools and equipment that would reflect credit on the city and on the\r\nschool board. He was a member of the board for sixteen years and its\r\npresident for eight years, and during the eight years he was president\r\nhe never had a disagreement with a member and there was never a question\r\ncame up which was not settled either by an unanimous vote or in a way\r\nthat left the members friendly. There never was a ‘row’ in the school\r\nboard and there never was a session where reporters were barred. In the\r\nlast eight years and under the management of Mr. Hackney, the school\r\nboard has spent $300,000 in school betterments and the total\r\nindebtedness is but $25,000 greater than it was eight years ago. This\r\nincludes the new Ingalls Building, Washington Building, accepting the\r\nplans and letting all contracts for the new Martin building, now under\r\ncourse of construction, rebuilding Franklin and building the new Douglas\r\nschool. In these eight years manual training, mechanical drawing,\r\ndomestic art and science, a commercial department, normal training,\r\nagriculture and physical training have been added to the high school, a\r\nschool nurse employed, music added to all grades and kindergartens\r\nestablished in two buildings. Since Mr. Hackney became a member of the\r\nboard the high school enrollment has increased from 66 to 338 and the\r\nfaculty from three to twenty members.”...\r\n\r\nDuring the time Mr. Hackney was a member of the school board he missed\r\nbut one regular meeting. He is president of the board of trustees of the\r\nFirst Presbyterian Church and is a member of the board of directors of\r\nthe Young Men’s Christian Association.\r\n\r\nHe was married in September of 1888, to Frances Blair, a daughter of E.\r\nK. Blair, deceased, formerly of Fayette county, Pennsylvania, founder of\r\nthe Blair Milling Company of Atchison. Mrs. Hackney’s mother was Barbara\r\n(Allen) Blair. She was born and reared in Atchison, in the house located\r\non the same lot where the Hackneys now live, with the exception of their\r\nfirst two years of married life, during which the new home was erected\r\nat 1021 North Third street. To Mr. and Mrs. Hackney have been born two\r\nchildren of whom they are justly proud, Helen Elizabeth, born 1890, a\r\ngraduate of the College Preparatory School of Atchison, and the Bennett\r\nSchool for Girls, located on the Hudson, in New York, carrying honors at\r\nboth her graduations; Edward Blair Hackney, born in 1893, is a graduate\r\nof the city high school and the Kansas University at Lawrence, where he\r\nreceived the degree of Bachelor of Arts. While a student of the\r\nuniversity he managed the _Jay Hawker_, the college annual, and\r\nperformed his duties so ably and so thoroughly that Chancellor Strong\r\ndeclared that the “Annual” issue under his management was the best ever\r\nissued, the cost of which was $4,500, and managed so well that a nice\r\nprofit was earned. The young man is now a traveling salesman for the\r\nBlair Milling Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GEORGE EDWIN WHITE.\r\n\r\nGeorge Edwin White, leading physician, of Effingham, Kan., was born at\r\nSavanna, Andrew county, Missouri, April 18, 1867, a son of Willis and\r\nRachel (Hall) White, natives of Indiana. Willis was the son of Drury\r\nWhite, who was born and reared in Virginia, and was a pioneer settler in\r\nGrant county, Indiana, where he hewed a farm and home from the virgin\r\ntimber at a time when it required men of hardihood and the greatest\r\nendurance to withstand the rigors of a life in the unbroken wilderness\r\nof the Hoosier State. Willis White was born August 12, 1840, and when he\r\nattained young manhood, hearkened to the call of President Lincoln for\r\ntroops to quell the rebellion of the Southern States, and enlisted at\r\nthe first call for “thirty thousand.” He served for ninety days in the\r\nTenth regiment, Indiana infantry. He migrated to Missouri in 1866 and\r\nplied his trade of blacksmith in the town of Savanna until 1880, when he\r\nmoved to Greenleaf, Kan., and conducted a blacksmith shop, in addition\r\nto cultivating his farm, which he purchased near Greenleaf. In the fall\r\nof 1907 he moved to Effingham, Kan., and is living a retired life. Mrs.\r\nWhite died in 1885, at the age of forty-three years. Twelve children\r\nwere born to Willis White and wife, four of whom are deceased: John,\r\nHenry, and Mary, deceased; Frank, for several years a practicing\r\nphysician of note in Effingham, and who died in October, 1912, as a\r\nresult of an accident; Charles, of Kansas City; Dr. George Edwin, with\r\nwhom this narrative is directly concerned; Albert H., a farmer, in\r\nDickinson county; Mrs. Dora Hill, of Kansas City; William, living in\r\nCalifornia; Mrs. Laura Shields, of California; Elmer, a farmer, of\r\nJackson county; Leroy, a farmer, of Effingham. Willis White was twice\r\nmarried, his second wife being Elizabeth Heavenridge, of Indiana, who\r\nbore him six children: Julia, employed in the Soldier’s Home at\r\nLeavenworth, Kan.; Herman, a farmer in western Kansas; Earl, of\r\nEffingham; Edith, at home; Ralph, also at home, and a child who died in\r\ninfancy.\r\n\r\nGeorge Edward White received his elementary education in the public\r\nschools, studied three years in the Kansas Medical College at Topeka,\r\nand graduated from the Medical University at Kansas City in 1905. For a\r\nperiod of five and one-half years he practiced medicine in Dickinson\r\ncounty, Kansas; practiced for two years in Brown county, Kansas, and\r\nlocated in Effingham in the fall of 1912.\r\n\r\nDr. White was married in 1895 to Sadie A. Phillippi, who died in 1911,\r\nleaving five children, namely: Willis, George, Lester, Birdie, and\r\nHarold, all of whom are at home and attending the public and high\r\nschools. One child, Ralph, died in infancy. Dr. White again married in\r\n1912, to Ada M. Elliot, a capable and talented woman, who is a good and\r\nkind mother to the doctor’s children.\r\n\r\nDr. White has achieved a reputation as a well read and capable\r\npractitioner, and his practice in Effingham and the surrounding country\r\nis constantly growing. He keeps abreast of the times and the latest\r\ndiscoveries in the science of healing, and is associated with various\r\nimportant medical societies, among them being the county, State, and\r\nNational societies, the Golden Belt, and the Northeast Kansas Medical\r\nassociation, the Aesculapian Society, and the University Medical College\r\nof Kansas City Alumni. He is a member of the Church of the Brethren, and\r\nis fraternally connected with the Knights of Pythias, the Knights and\r\nLadies of Security, and the Mystic Workers. He is a Republican, but has\r\nvery little time for political affairs. Dr. White is a genial, whole-\r\nsouled gentleman, who loves his profession and his fellowmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GEORGE W. THOMPSON.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Thompson is one of the oldest pioneers living in the State of\r\nKansas, and is all probability the oldest living pioneer in Atchison\r\ncounty today. His career has been an interesting and even romantic one,\r\nand reads like a tale from modern fiction. Homesteader, farmer,\r\nstatesman, politician and man of wide influence are terms which can well\r\nbe applied to this aged gentleman who has spent sixty-one years of his\r\nfour score and eight in assisting in the development of the Sunflower\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _George W. Thompson and Wife_\r\n\r\n  One of the Oldest Pioneer Couples in Atchison County\r\n]\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Thompson was born in Georgetown, Ky., October 18, 1827, a son\r\nof Benjamin and Nancy (Baxter) Thompson, natives of Virginia and\r\nMaryland, respectively, and descendants of old southern stock. Benjamin\r\nThompson was born in Virginia in 1799, the same year in which George\r\nWashington died. He was a son of George Thompson, who removed from\r\nVirginia to Kentucky in 1811, walking the entire distance over the Blue\r\nRidge mountains to the new home in the forests of Kentucky, where they\r\nlived until 1843, and then joined the influx of settlers who were going\r\ninto Platte county, Missouri. The Thompsons loaded their entire effects\r\non wagons and drove as far as Frankfort, Ky., and then boarded an Ohio\r\nriver steamer which carried them to St. Louis. An interesting episode of\r\nthis trip concerns the passage of the boat over the falls at Louisville,\r\nKy., or five miles below that city. At that time the water was very high\r\nin the river, and the captain of the steamer decided to take a chance\r\nand go over the falls. During the passage the pilot’s steering gear\r\nbroke and the boat drifted over the falls without guidance in safety,\r\nbut not without expressions of fear on the part of the passengers. This\r\nboat was the “Meridian,” one of the fast steamers of the river, and it\r\nfrequently raced with other river craft. The trip required about three\r\ndays from Louisville to St. Louis, which was at that time a city of\r\nabout 50,000 inhabitants. Mr. Thompson recalls that the boats were lined\r\nup along the wharfs at St. Louis for over one and one-half miles, and he\r\nhas never forgotten the sight. About five days longer were required to\r\nmake the trip from St. Louis to Parkville, Mo., the trip ending on June\r\n14, having commenced June 1, 1843. Benjamin plied his trade of\r\nbricklayer in Platte county, and built the Green Hotel in Platte City,\r\nwhich is still standing as a monument to his skill and handicraft as a\r\nmason. He was the first brick mason in Platte City and he erected the\r\nGreen Hotel in 1844. Benjamin became prominent in the affairs of Platte\r\ncounty and was a fine orator and public speaker.\r\n\r\nFor many years he was an active and influential figure in the political\r\nlife of Platte county, and he was a poet who left many evidences of\r\ncreative literary ability which are still prized among the archives of\r\nthe county. He resided in Missouri until 1860 and then came to Kansas\r\nwhere he spent the remainder of his days, dying in Mt. Pleasant township\r\nin 1862. His wife survived him and lived to an advanced age, dying in\r\n1892, having been born in Rosamount county, Maryland, near Curlew. They\r\nreared a fine family of nine children, of which George W. was the third\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Thompson, with whom this review is directly concerned, grew to\r\nsturdy manhood in old Kentucky, and was educated in the neighborhood\r\nschools. Since boyhood, he has been a student and is at this day one of\r\nthe best read men of his generation. He learned the trade of bricklayer\r\nunder his father and followed the trade while living in Missouri. As\r\nearly as 1854 he came to Kansas, on the day following the passage of the\r\nKansas-Nebraska act which threw the Territory open to settlement. He\r\ncame up the Missouri river in a small boat and landed at the mouth of\r\nNine Mile creek in Leavenworth county. After investigating the\r\npossibilities in this county, he filed upon a Government claim and went\r\nback to his home in Platte county, returning in January of 1854 to erect\r\na log cabin. This erected, he again went home, returning in November and\r\nroofed his cabin with clapboards made by him and his brother, and built\r\na stone chimney and daubed the chinks with mud. He located permanently\r\non his claim January 15, 1855, and on his way nearly lost his oxen in\r\nthe river. In the meantime a man named Dunham had jumped his claim, and\r\nit became necessary for him and Dunham to compromise matters and divide\r\nthe land which was considered valuable because it had a very fine spring\r\nof good, pure water available. Two years later Mr. Thompson sold his\r\nclaim and entered 160 acres of land in Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison\r\ncounty. He moved to Atchison June 14, 1856. He developed this farm and\r\nlived on it for forty-eight years, or until 1914, when he came to\r\nAtchison to reside with his daughter, Mrs. Keats.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson was married in Missouri in 1850, to Rebecca Stigers, a\r\nnative of Knox county, Ohio, born April 18, 1831, a daughter of Conrad\r\nStigers, a native of Germany. The mother of Mrs. Thompson was Mary Snell\r\nStigers, who was born in Virginia, of French parents, and whose father\r\nwas shipwrecked on the coast of Virginia. She was a direct descendant of\r\nthe famous French family of D’ Estang, and her father was a connection\r\nof Count D’ Estang. To Mr. and Mrs. George W. Thompson were born nine\r\nchildren: Benjamin T., born October 11, 1850, in Missouri, and died\r\nMarch 12, 1902; Mary Katharine, born October 2, 1854, wife of Asa\r\nBarnes, of Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison county; John Emmet, born\r\nFebruary 17, 1857, in Atchison county, and now residing in California;\r\nHarriet M., born April 2, 1859, wife of T. M. Grant, Atchison county;\r\nLouis T., born May 8, 1861, died May 1, 1864; Mrs. Dora T. Keats, born\r\nMarch 21, 1864, wife of H. T. Keats, of Atchison; George McClelland,\r\nborn May 20, 1867, a farmer, Mt. Pleasant township; Clara Thompson, born\r\nSeptember 5, 1870, and Albert T., born October 5, 1873, died in infancy.\r\n\r\nThe Thompson family is one of the oldest in America and is of English\r\norigin. The founder of the family came to Virginia with Capt. John Smith\r\nin 1607, and through the marriage of John Rolfe with Pocahontas, the\r\nprincess daughter of old King Powhatan of the Indian tribes of Virginia,\r\nthe family and successive generations claim to have Indian blood in\r\ntheir veins. They are or were connected with the famous Pickett family,\r\nof whom General Pickett was a member. It will thus be seen that on one\r\nside the present members of the family can lay claim to being descended\r\nfrom the nobility and on another to being descended from an Indian\r\nprincess and one of the earliest of the old Virginia gentlemen. It is\r\nnot to be wondered that the founder of the family in Atchison county has\r\nmade such a fine record during his long residence here.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson has always taken an active and influential part in the\r\npolitical affairs of Kansas, and has been a life-long Democrat. He has\r\nthe unique distinction of having voted for but one candidate who was\r\nelected President, and that was Franklin Pierce in 1852. This is\r\nprobably due to the fact that he has always been independent in his\r\nvoting, and acted upon his own convictions when it came time to cast his\r\nballot. His last vote was cast for Theodore Roosevelt. When Populism was\r\nin vogue in Kansas he voted for the Populist candidate for President. It\r\nwas only natural that he himself become a candidate for office on\r\naccount of his education and the inherent gift for leadership. He served\r\nas a member of the Kansas legislature at the sessions of 1867, 1868 and\r\n1869, and has been a candidate a few times since. At another time, early\r\nin his career, he was elected superintendent of public instruction in\r\nAtchison county, but refused to serve, and sent in his resignation. His\r\nlast candidacy for the legislature was given him by the fusion of the\r\nPopulists and Democrats, but he was defeated by White by a very small\r\nmajority. During the campaign of 1866, he was asked to become a\r\ncandidate for the legislature by many Republican friends and upon the\r\nadvice of his many friends in the county, he cast his votes for both\r\nRoss and Pomeroy for the positions in the United States Senate. It is a\r\nmatter of history that both Ross and Pomeroy were elected to represent\r\nKansas in the United States Senate, Ross subsequently making himself\r\nvery conspicuous by voting against the impeachment of Andrew Johnson.\r\n\r\nThis fine old pioneer was also a soldier in the Civil war, and served as\r\nfirst lieutenant of the company commanded by Capt. Asa Barnes in the\r\nbattle of Westport. Mrs. H. T. Keats, daughter of Mr. Thompson, has in\r\nher possession a number of interesting souvenirs of this battle, among\r\nthem being the belt buckle, and bayonet worn by her father in the\r\nbattle, and the company’s flag, Captain Barnes’ shoulder straps, and\r\nJames Binkley’s cap box, in addition to having some of the Government\r\nscrip, with which the soldiers were paid. The colonel of the Twelfth\r\nregiment was Colonel Louis L. Treat, another member of the company being\r\nT. L. Cline. Very few of the members of this company or regiment are now\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nOn October 8, 1915, this noted old pioneer was eighty-eight years old\r\nand still vigorous, mentally. His power of thinking is not much\r\ndiminished, and he is still a reader and student. Constant reading and\r\nthinking, we are told, is conducive to longevity and Mr. Thompson has\r\nalways been a great reader and student of history and philosophy. He is\r\na man, self-made and self-taught, and is blessed with a keenness of\r\nintellect far above the average. His life has been a well rounded and\r\nuseful one, and he has had a career of which he and his children and\r\ngrandchildren can well be proud. His long life has been clean and for\r\nyears he has been a stern advocate of temperance and has practiced his\r\nown belief. In his younger days he was a noted and powerful orator who\r\nhad the ability to thrill and sway his hearers. Few men can look back\r\nover a longer vista of years, well spent in honest pursuits, and in\r\nbehalf of his fellow men than George W. Thompson. All honor to him as\r\nthe oldest and most distinguished living pioneer of Atchison today.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            B. F. TOMLINSON.\r\n\r\nB. F. Tomlinson, deceased, was a pioneer merchant and meat packer of\r\nAtchison, and left behind him an imperishable record for honesty and\r\nfair dealing, which has never been surpassed in the mercantile history\r\nof the city. He was born December 25, 1838, in Covington, Ky., a son of\r\nLeroy Tomlinson, who was also a native of Kentucky. The mother of B. F.\r\nTomlinson died when he was a small boy, and as a consequence little is\r\nknown regarding her antecedents. The Tomlinsons are a very old American\r\nfamily. Leroy Tomlinson was a commission merchant and meat packer, who\r\nlater removed from Covington to Louisville, Ky., and became prominently\r\nidentified with the business interests of that city. He conducted a\r\nlarge packing establishment and handled as high as 100 beeves at one\r\ntime in his abattoirs, wholesaling the product of his packing houses to\r\nmeat merchants in the cities and towns bordering the Ohio river.\r\n\r\nB. F. Tomlinson, with whose career this review is directly concerned,\r\nwas reared and educated in the city of Louisville, Ky., and when he was\r\nbut fifteen years of age his father died, his stepmother dying one year\r\nlater. Being an only child, he was left with the responsibility of his\r\nfather’s extensive business. The excellent training which his father had\r\ngiven him, here came into good stead, and he carried on the packing\r\nbusiness successfully, paying, in the course of time, a considerable\r\nindebtedness which his father had incurred. After his marriage in\r\nLouisville in 1860, he continued to conduct his business in Louisville\r\nuntil 1870, at which time he disposed of his possessions and came to\r\nAtchison. Here he engaged in the butcher and packing business, and soon\r\nheld a prominent place in the mercantile life of the city.\r\n\r\nB. F. Tomlinson was married September 11, 1860, to Miss Elizabeth\r\nAlexander, who was born May 11, 1840, in Bedford, Ind. She was a\r\ndaughter of Robert M. and Emily (Legrant) Alexander. Her father was a\r\ncoach-maker by trade, and removed from Bedford, Ind., to Louisville,\r\nKy., where he died in 1900, at the age of eighty-nine years. Much\r\ninteresting history can be narrated concerning the mother of Mrs.\r\nTomlinson, who was born in New Orleans, and was one of three children\r\nborn to her parents, who were of French origin. The elder Legrant was a\r\ndrygoods merchant in the southern city, and the story goes, that on one\r\nof his regular trips to Cincinnati, Ohio, to buy a stock of goods for\r\nhis store, he left two of the children at home, and on arriving in\r\nCincinnati he placed Emily in charge of a Scotch family by the name of\r\nMcDonald, and with whom he had been in the habit of stopping while on\r\nbusiness in Cincinnati. Emily at that time was twelve years of age, and\r\nwas a prime favorite with the McDonald’s who begged her parents to leave\r\nher at their home during the time which would elapse until Mr. and Mrs.\r\nLegrant made their next trip from New Orleans to Cincinnati. They did\r\nso, but sad to relate, the little girl never saw nor heard from her\r\nparents again, and what became of them she never learned, and she was\r\nconsequently reared to womanhood by the kind foster parents. In an\r\nearlier year than this at New Orleans, and at a time when Emily’s father\r\nwas very sick with rheumatism, a band of over one hundred Indians was\r\nencamped near the Legrant home at New Orleans. One of the other children\r\nwas also afflicted with cancer of the face. The medicine men of the\r\nIndian tribe effected a cure of both the cancer and the father’s\r\nrheumatism. The Indians were very affectionate toward Emily and called\r\nher the “pretty squaw,” which was only natural, as she grew up to become\r\na very beautiful woman, eventually becoming the wife of Robert M.\r\nAlexander, and after her husband’s demise, made her home with her\r\ndaughter at Atchison, where she died in November of 1904, at the\r\nadvanced age of eighty-nine years.\r\n\r\nB. F. Tomlinson died in January, 1895. Mr. and Mrs. Tomlinson were the\r\nparents of eight children: Martha J., wife of Louis Nelson, of St.\r\nJoseph, Mo., and mother of one child, Frank B.; Emma T. Bosanko,\r\ndeceased, left one son, Harry; Lydia, wife of Frank Russell, of St.\r\nPaul, Minn., and mother of one son, Clarence Russell; Alice, wife of W.\r\nL. Johnson, of Atchison; Anna A., wife of Charles Robertson, of Chicago;\r\nRobert, a resident of Columbia, Mo., and who has one daughter, Ecce\r\nTomlinson; Franklin, deceased; Birdie died in infancy. The mother of\r\nthese children is now three score and fifteen years of age, but does not\r\nappear to be over fifty years old. She is remarkably well preserved and\r\nhas a keen mind, and is especially proud of her husband’s record and\r\nfine family of children.\r\n\r\nMr. Tomlinson was a member of several fraternal societies, among them\r\nbeing the Modern Woodmen, the Knights of Honor, and the Ancient Order of\r\nUnited Workmen. He was politically allied with the Democratic party, but\r\nnever sought political preferment. He was well and favorably known and\r\nhighly respected in business circles in Atchison, his greatest and\r\nkindliest trait being his generosity in giving assistance to the poor\r\nand deserving of the city. He was always ready to listen to the call of\r\nthe suffering and improvident, and never turned away a supplicant in\r\ndire need empty handed. It might be said of him that he was too generous\r\nfor his own financial welfare, but he sincerely believed in the\r\nwholeness of his nature in giving of his sustenance to those whom he\r\ndeemed in need. The indulgence of this Christian trait of giving\r\nnaturally endeared his memory to a host of friends, who will long\r\nremember him. Few men were more liberal or kinder than this upright\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN D. HAWK.\r\n\r\nIn the science of agriculture, as well as the learned professions, there\r\nare always men who are naturally endowed with the powers of leadership,\r\nand are so progressive and energetic that they lead in the van of better\r\nand more productive farming where others follow. Atchison county has its\r\nquota of these progressive agriculturists who are not content to be just\r\ncommon, every-day farmers, but are ambitious to become specialists in\r\nagricultural work. John D. Hawk, of Benton township, Atchison county,\r\nholds a place in the front rank of successful and enterprising farmers\r\nin Atchison county, and is the owner of one of the most productive and\r\nbest equipped agricultural plants in the county, or northeast Kansas.\r\nHis farm comprises 170 acres, located in section 2, range 618, Benton\r\ntownship. A good farm home sets well back from the road, in the rear of\r\nwhich is a large red barn. 86×46 feet, hip roofed and flanked by a\r\nmodern silo, built in 1910, and which is the first wood silo erected in\r\nAtchison county. Mr. Hawk is beginning the breeding of thoroughbred\r\nJersey cattle, and at the present time has a fine dairy herd of twenty-\r\nfive head, among which is a number of pure breds. Leading this herd is\r\n“Shawan Majesty,” a pure bred bull. He also specializes in Poland China\r\nhogs, and is meeting with success in the breeding and raising of live\r\nstock. Mrs. Hawk keeps a pure strain of Black Langshan poultry and\r\nhandles this end of the farm work with profit and satisfaction.\r\n\r\nJohn D. Hawk was born November 19, 1875, on a farm in Coshocton county,\r\nOhio, a son of Lafayette T. Hawk, of Benton township, a sketch of whom\r\nappears in this volume. He was seven years of age when his parents\r\nremoved to Atchison county, Kansas, from their Ohio home. Here he\r\nattended the district school, and had the advantage of one year’s study\r\nin the county high school. He worked on the home farm with his father\r\nuntil 1898, when he began for himself in the spring of that year on the\r\nMcClennon farm which he rented for two years. After his marriage he\r\nremoved to his present place which is the old Law homestead. He erected\r\nthe present barn and the large poultry house on the place and made\r\nvarious other improvements including the building of the silo.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawk was married March 15, 1899, to Miss Alice M. Law, who has borne\r\nhim eight children, of whom seven are living: Walter Gale, born January\r\n12, and died February 1, 1900; Herbert, aged fifteen years; Kenneth,\r\nborn November 19, 1902; Dorothy, aged ten; Mateel, nine years old; John,\r\naged six years; and twins, Vera and Veda, born December 12, 1911. The\r\nmother of these children was born in Toronto, Canada, a daughter of\r\nEdwin and Mary Alice Law, both of whom were born in England. Edwin Law\r\ncomes of a family of singers, and it is a matter of record that his\r\nmother sang before Queen Victoria on one occasion, and was noted\r\nthroughout England as a singer of note. The Laws immigrated from England\r\nand first settled in Canada, going from there to Ohio, and after a short\r\nresidence in the Buckeye State, migrated to Doniphan county, Kansas,\r\nfrom whence they came to Atchison county and purchased the farm where\r\nMr. and Mrs. Hawk now reside. There were five children in the family:\r\nAlfred Law, Ella, Alice, Walter, and one died in infancy. Mrs. Law died\r\non the farm, and Mr. Law died in Canon City, Colo. After his first\r\nwife’s death, Mr. Law again married, and had one daughter, Lillie, by\r\nhis second marriage.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawk is a Republican, but his activities do not tend to political\r\naffairs. For several years he has been actively identified with\r\nagricultural affairs in Atchison county, and his influence has ever been\r\nexerted in behalf of better farming. He is president of the Atchison\r\nCounty Farm Bureau, of which institution he is one of the organizers. In\r\nconnection with Fred Sutter, Alexander McClennon, he assisted in the\r\npromotion of the Farm Bureau and its establishment, and the consequent\r\nemployment of County Agent Taylor as a skilled farm instructor. This is\r\nnow considered as one of the finest and most beneficial moves ever made\r\nin the county in behalf of the farmers of the county, and even the most\r\nincredulous who were unwilling to support the movement are now coming\r\ninto line and becoming enthusiastic over the possibilities for bettering\r\nfarm conditions in the county as the result of the efforts put forth by\r\nits zealous supporters. This committee during the winter of 1914–1915\r\nvisited every part of the county, in the preliminary organization and\r\nmissionary work, and enrolled 200 farmers as supporters of the project.\r\nMr. Hawk is likewise president of the Atchison county Farmers’\r\nInstitute. He attends the Christian church, of which Mrs. Hawk is a\r\nmember, and is fraternally affiliated with the Central Protective\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HERBERT J. BARBER.\r\n\r\nA man’s standing in the community where he resides or transacts his\r\nbusiness affairs is usually gauged by his usefulness to society and his\r\nactivities in behalf of the general good of his fellows. If he be of the\r\nclass of citizens who are seeking to benefit the community in which he\r\nis engaged in business, he is a decided benefit to that community. Such\r\nan individual is Herbert J. Barber, banker of Cummings, Kan. Mr. Barber\r\nis a native of the Sunflower State, and is a son of one of the early\r\npioneers. The story of Moses Barber, his father, Union veteran, Kansas\r\npioneer, and one of the first successful fruit growers of Atchison\r\ncounty, is interesting and borders on the romantic to a considerable\r\ndegree. Over fifty years ago, directly after his honorable discharge\r\nfrom the Union service at Leavenworth, Moses Barber set out on horseback\r\nto find a place for a home in Atchison county. He found the homestead,\r\nand at the same time found a sweetheart who later became his wife and\r\nfought the good fight with him through the lean years and good ones\r\nuntil he attained to the realization of his ambitions to obtain a\r\ncompetence. He became widely known as the “Apple King” of Kansas as a\r\nresult of his remarkable success as a grower of apples, and cultivated\r\nwhat was in all probability the largest apple orchard in existence in\r\nthe State of Kansas in his day. His son, Herbert, has followed in his\r\nfather’s footsteps and is fast making a name for himself in the field of\r\nfinance. Speaking in a biographical sense, Herbert J. Barber was born on\r\nthe old homestead of his father in Mt. Pleasant township, April 11,\r\n1871, a son of Moses and Mary (Hubbard) Barber, the former a native of\r\nRhode Island, and the latter a native of Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Moses Barber_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Mary (Hubbard) Barber_\r\n]\r\n\r\nMoses Barber was born in South Kingston, Rhode Island, April 22, 1833, a\r\nson of James and Elizabeth Barber, natives of Rhode Island, of colonial\r\nancestry and English descent. A brother of James was Colonel Barber, who\r\nserved in the War of 1812, and the grandfather of Moses Barber was a\r\nRevolutionary soldier. Moses was reared to young manhood on his father’s\r\nfarm in Rhode Island, and then migrated westward to Illinois. After a\r\nresidence of a few years in Illinois he came to Kansas and was a\r\nresident of the State upon the outbreak of the rebellion of the Southern\r\nStates. He enlisted in Company I, Second regiment, Kansas cavalry, in\r\n1861, and was soon promoted to ranking sergeant of his company. He\r\nserved his country well and faithfully and took part in several hard\r\nfought engagements with his regiment, and received his honorable\r\ndischarge at the close of the war at Leavenworth, Kan. After receiving\r\nhis discharge from the service he set out on horseback in search of a\r\nhomestead, riding the faithful cavalry horse which had carried him\r\nthrough the strenuous days of the Civil war. His route led him in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction from Ft. Leavenworth through Atchison county. He\r\nstopped for sustenance and rest at the home of a family named Hubbard at\r\nParnell, Kan. Mr. Hubbard was a pro-slavery and State rights man who had\r\nremoved from the Southland in 1855 after two years in Missouri, a State\r\nrights advocate, and although Mr. Barber was his guest, they had\r\nfrequent clashes over the troubles of the South and war incidents. The\r\nbitterness of the great conflict had not yet been obliterated, and it\r\nwas only natural that the Union veteran and State’s rights man should\r\nhave disagreements. This was not all of their troubles, as time soon\r\ndeveloped. Mr. Hubbard had an attractive daughter, and thereby hangs a\r\ntale of romance. Mary Hubbard was the acme of beauty in the eyes of\r\nyoung Barber and he purposely stayed around in the neighborhood that he\r\ncould be near Mary and do his courting despite the evident antipathy of\r\nFather Hubbard. In fact, Moses often said later, “That was the reason I\r\nstayed there.” The attraction between Mary and Moses grew into\r\nfriendship, friendship ripened into love, and the son of the North and\r\nthe daughter of the South were married. The parental opposition to this\r\nnatural outcome of the meeting of two young souls who were evidently\r\ndestined for each other was so great that a quiet marriage was\r\nnecessary. Moses and Mary quietly departed one day and returned to the\r\nparental roof as man and wife. Mr. and Mrs. Hubbard soon afterwards\r\ndecided to accept the inevitable and become fond of their son-in-law.\r\nTime and subsequent events proved that Moses and Mary were well mated\r\nand the marriage, if a hasty one, proved to be very happy in the years\r\nto come. Mr. Hubbard soon afterward went west to satisfy the gold fever\r\nwhich obsessed him and Moses Barber settled down on his father-in-law’s\r\nfarm which he purchased, thus beginning a highly successful career as an\r\nagriculturist. The first home of him and his young wife was a little log\r\ncabin which formerly belonged to the Hubbards, but as prosperity came as\r\nthe reward of years of careful husbandry, he erected a handsome farm\r\nresidence of thirteen rooms which still stands on the place, built in\r\n1882. Mr. Barber was one of the first men in Kansas to see the\r\npossibilities in fruit growing and early began to develop that part of\r\nthe farming avocation. He planted four or five acres of apple trees as a\r\nstart in his horticultural experiments, and his success with his first\r\norchard was so gratifying that he increased his apple orchards to sixty\r\nacres of bearing trees. He became widely known as the “Apple King of\r\nKansas.” While managing his immense fruit orchard he did not neglect the\r\nother side of the farm work and cultivated assiduously and successfully\r\nhis large farm of 320 acres of land in Mt. Pleasant township. In the\r\nearly days he was a large cattle feeder and made large shipments to the\r\nstock markets.\r\n\r\nMoses Barber was married May 15, 1865, to Miss Mary Hubbard and this\r\nunion was blessed with two children: Mrs. Abigail Brayman, of Wickford.\r\nR. I., and Herbert J., with whom this review is directly concerned. Mr.\r\nBarber departed this life July 3, 1896, after having lived a long and\r\nuseful life which was profitable as well as happy. Mrs. Mary (Hubbard)\r\nBarber, his surviving widow, was born May 7, 1845, in Roanoke county,\r\nVirginia, and was a daughter of Clark and Rebecca Hubbard, both of whom\r\nwere born and reared in Virginia and came to Kansas in 1855. Mrs. Barber\r\nresides with her son, Herbert J., in Atchison, Kan.\r\n\r\nHerbert J. Barber attended the district school of his neighborhood in\r\nMt. Pleasant township and later pursued a course in the Atchison\r\nBusiness College. After finishing his business course he returned to his\r\nfather’s farm and took charge of the fruit growing and general farming.\r\nLater he spent three years in Colorado in the employ of a Denver\r\nwholesale book and stationery house. In 1894 he returned to the home\r\nfarm and successfully managed it until 1908. He then removed to\r\nCummings, Kan., and assisted in the organization of the Cummings State\r\nBank. He became the cashier of this institution and has given evidence\r\nof decided financial and business ability of a high order in his\r\nvocation. Besides his banking interests Mr. Barber has land holdings in\r\nColorado and western Kansas. He makes his residence at 1020 Santa Fe\r\nstreet in Atchison.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of H. J. Barber and Miss Eva Wertz was solemnized in\r\nFebruary 19, 1902. Mrs. Barber was born the twenty-sixth of May, 1878,\r\nin Pennsylvania, a daughter of David and Eliza Wertz, both of whom were\r\nborn and reared in the Keystone State. David Wertz was for many years a\r\nmerchant at Parnell, Kan., and is now living in retirement at that\r\nplace. The mother of Mrs. Barber is now deceased. One child, Mary Reta,\r\nborn August 13, 1904, has blessed the marriage of Herbert J. and Eva\r\nBarber.\r\n\r\nPolitically, Mr. Barber is a Republican, and has held the office of\r\ntrustee of Mt. Pleasant township for four years. He and his family are\r\nreligiously affiliated with the Baptist church. He is a member of the\r\nAncient Free and Accepted Masons, Washington lodge, No. 5, of Atchison,\r\nand the Modern Woodmen of America. Mr. Barber is a booster and public-\r\nspirited citizen by nature and is always ready and willing to support\r\nanything for the good of the community and the people. Every civic\r\nprogram which will have a tendency to benefit the whole of the people\r\nfinds him as one of its warmest supporters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ROBERT PINDER.\r\n\r\nRobert Pinder, the efficient and capable manager of the Effingham Lumber\r\nCompany, while having been a resident of Effingham but a few years, has\r\nso identified himself with the life of the community and taken such an\r\nactive part in the city’s affairs, that his citizenship is an important\r\nand component part of the body politic. He is a hustler in both thought\r\nand deed, and strives to advance his city as well as managing his\r\nbusiness at profit, and so as to gain increasing prestige for the lumber\r\ncompany’s business, which has been under the present management since\r\n1912. The company conducts a general lumber business, and sells all\r\nkinds of building material, such as farm gates, Crown and Tulsa silos,\r\nof superior make, tiling, roofing and roof paints, etc. The sheds and\r\nyards cover six lots, and Mr. Pinder employs two men to care for the\r\nbusiness. The president of the company is W. C. Alexander, of Atchison;\r\nthe vice president is T. B. Pinder, of Clifton, Kan., and the general\r\nmanager and secretary-treasurer is Robert Pinder, with whom this\r\nnarrative is directly concerned.\r\n\r\nRobert Pinder was born September 5, 1872, in Timberland, England, a son\r\nof John and Anna (Burton) Pinder, who were farmers in their native\r\ncountry, and about 1894 immigrated to this country and settled on a farm\r\nnear Everest, Kan., where they died. In 1886 Robert was indentured at\r\nMartindales, England, for three years and one and one-half years at\r\nHorncastle, to grocery and provision merchants, with the understanding\r\nthat he was to receive his board and lodging, and his father was to\r\nprovide for other necessaries, such as wearing apparel, and medicine, in\r\ncase of sickness. His periods of indenture required both day and night\r\nservice and to play no games, or frequent taverns or dice tables, or\r\ncontract matrimony, or buy and sell. For an American boy to be required\r\nto do anything of this sort would be considered the rankest injustice,\r\nand he would rebel at being compelled seemingly to sacrifice his liberty\r\nand become a bound employe for so long a time. But such is the custom in\r\nEngland, and the training which Robert Pinder received during his four\r\nand one-half years of indenture proved exceedingly valuable lo him in\r\nlater years. After serving his time as an apprentice he continued in the\r\nprovision business for three and one-half years longer, and then came to\r\nAmerica, journeying direct to Doniphan county in 1894. In the spring of\r\nthe following year he moved out on the farm owned by his father, who had\r\nbrought the entire family, with the exception of one brother, to this\r\ncountry. He assisted his father in the cultivation of the farm for four\r\nyears, and then accepted a position in the lumber business of E. L.\r\nAlexander, at Everest, Kan., in the spring of 1899. Three months later\r\nhe became manager of the Purcell Lumber Company, at Purcell, Kan., and\r\nremained in this position for three years, following which employment he\r\nwas manager of the Alexander Lumber Company at Havensville, Kan., for\r\nover ten years. In the spring of 1912 Mr. Pinder came to Effingham and\r\ntook charge of the Effingham Lumber Company. His success in the lumber\r\nbusiness has been marked and rapid, and is an indication of true and\r\ntireless business ability of a high order. He is secretary and a\r\nstockholder of the Alexander Lumber Company, a large concern: secretary\r\nof the Harrison Lumber Company, of Garnett, Kan., and is interested in\r\nthis concern as a stockholder. Mr. Pinder also administered the family\r\nestate after his father’s death in 1909, and his mother’s demise in the\r\nyear following. There were eight children in the family: Frederick died\r\nin infancy; John W., living, in England; Edith Mary, wife of William\r\nPinder, of Huron, Kan.; Robert; Charles, a farmer living near Huron:\r\nHenrietta died at Everest; Emma A., wife of Arthur Harris, of Everest;\r\nThomas Benton, in the lumber business at Clifton, Kan.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinder was married November 1, 1900, to Harriet M. Pinder, who was\r\nborn in Denton, a daughter of A. G. Pinder, a farmer, residing near\r\nHuron, Kan. Four children have blessed this union: Ruth Mary, born in\r\nNovember, 1901; Cecil Francis, born in 1903; Leslie Benton, born in\r\n1906; John Sylvester, born in 1909.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinder is a progressive Republican, and has pronounced and decided\r\nviews upon independence in politics, and believes in “a government of\r\nthe people and by the people,” and not for the benefit of the favored\r\nfew. He is affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal church, and is\r\nfraternally allied with the Knights and Ladies of Security, and the\r\nLumberman’s “Hoo-Hoo” society.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THOMAS J. POTTER.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-four years Thomas J. Potter has served the people well and\r\nfaithfully as postmaster of the town which was named in honor of his\r\nfather. Joseph Potter, one of the distinguished pioneer settlers of\r\nAtchison county, Kansas. Thomas J. Potter was born January 29, 1856, on\r\na farm which later became the townsite of Potter, Kan., and was settled\r\nupon by his father in 1854. Mr. Potter probably holds the record for\r\nlong and continuous residence in Atchison county as a native son of this\r\ncounty. He was a son of Joseph and Minerva (Wiley) Potter, natives of\r\nKentucky and descendants of colonial ancestry. Thomas Potter, father of\r\nJoseph, tracing his ancestry direct to a member of the colony founded at\r\nJamestown, Va., by Capt. John Smith, in 1607. Thomas Potter, grandfather\r\nof T. J., was born in old Virginia, and was a pioneer settler in Lincoln\r\ncounty, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nJoseph Potter was born in 1819 in Kentucky, married there and reared a\r\nfamily. When Kentucky began to take on a crowded condition, which was\r\ninimical to a great many of the early settlers of the Daniel Boone\r\nclass, Thomas Potter conceived the idea of migrating westward, as Boone\r\nhad done. Accordingly, he sent his son, Joseph, to the wild country of\r\nSaline county, Missouri, to find out about the fertility of the land,\r\nand to determine whether or not the country was suitable for settlement.\r\nJoseph made the trip in safety and made a favorable report on his\r\narrival home. The family, thereupon, disposed of their land holdings in\r\nKentucky and made the overland trip to Missouri, finally locating in\r\nBuchanan county of that State, near the town of DeKalb, in 1846. Here\r\nJoseph Potter was married in 1851 to Minerva Wiley, whose parents had\r\nmigrated from the old home in Kentucky to Buchanan county, Missouri,\r\nabout the same time the Potter family had settled there. Three years\r\nlater, in 1854, Joseph Potter and his wife removed to Atchison county\r\nand filed upon an 160 acre claim, on part of which acreage the town of\r\nPotter is now built. This was some years before Kansas became a State,\r\nand about the time the great struggle between the pro- and anti-slavery\r\nmen was beginning for the control of Kansas. Joseph Potter was a strong\r\nanti-slavery man, who was not afraid to voice his convictions in\r\nunmistakable language at any and all times. He was firm in his belief\r\nthat slavery was an evil which should be abolished, and his\r\naggressiveness led him into frequent conflicts with the pro-slavery\r\nadvocates. He was one of the able and fearless leaders of the anti-\r\nslavery contingent in Atchison county, and many times he was threatened\r\nwith physical violence. At the time of one of the territorial elections,\r\nonly three Free State votes were cast in Joseph Potter’s precinct. Four\r\nthousand votes, a number far in excess of the actual number of voters in\r\nthe territory, were cast at this election, and pro-slavery men came from\r\nMissouri, and even from Kentucky, and voted several times in favor of\r\nmaking Kansas a slave State.\r\n\r\nJoseph Potter was a Mexican war veteran. He enlisted in 1846 as a\r\nprivate soldier in the regular army of the United States, and served\r\nthroughout the Mexican conflict under Col. Sterling Price. When the\r\nCivil war broke out he was appointed recruiting officer for the Federal\r\nGovernment, and later served as a captain in the Kansas State militia.\r\nJoseph Potter served one term as a member of the State legislature. In\r\nthe year 1886 the town of Potter was established and named in his honor.\r\n\r\nOne of the most cherished of the friendships of this hardy pioneer was\r\nthat of the late Senator John J. Ingalls, a friendship which began in\r\nthe troublous days preceding the Civil war, and endured until death\r\nparted them, long afterward. Mr. Potter’s first impression of John J.\r\nIngalls was obtained at an anti-slavery meeting held in Mount Pleasant\r\ntownship, and he was fond of relating the occurrence after the Senator\r\nbecame a Nation-wide character of prominence. Joseph Potter was the\r\npolitical leader of the anti-slavery party in that section of the State\r\nat the time, and Mr. Ingalls, then a young man of twenty-five, had\r\nopened his law office a few weeks previously in the old town of Sumner,\r\nKan. Ingalls spoke at this meeting, and it is recalled, that as he arose\r\nto speak, a tall young man, pale and slender, the impression that he\r\nmade upon his audience was small, and there were those present who even\r\nsneered when he began to speak. It was not long, however, as the future\r\nsenator swung into his theme, until he convinced his auditors that he\r\nhad a thorough knowledge of Kansas conditions, and could speak with an\r\neloquence and honesty of delivery that was convincing. The listeners who\r\ncame to scoff, left the meeting as warm admirers of Mr. Ingalls, and Mr.\r\nPotter was forever afterward his warm supporter.\r\n\r\nJoseph Potter and his wife were the parents of eight children, as\r\nfollows: Celia J., wife of T. Lawler, of Cowles, Neb.; Francis, living\r\non the old home place in Walnut township; Alice P., residing on the home\r\nfarm; Josephine P., wife of J. W. Miller, of Atchison; Thomas J.; Samuel\r\nL., a banker, living at Cutbank, Mont.; John J., also living on the old\r\nhomestead.\r\n\r\nThomas J. Potter was born and reared on the old home farm of the Potter\r\nfamily, and followed the occupation of a tiller of the soil until he was\r\ntwenty-seven years of age. He was appointed postmaster of the town of\r\nPotter, and was re-appointed in 1898, and has held the office\r\ncontinuously ever since. He was married in 1882 to Fannie M. Brown, a\r\ndaughter of John Brown, of Missouri. Two children bless this union:\r\nGeorge Potter, in the United States mail service in Chicago, Ill., and\r\nGarland J., wife of Charles Pruitt, of Sioux Falls, S. D. The mother of\r\nthese children died in February, 1906. In the year 1913 Mr. Potter took\r\nfor his second wife, Mrs. Estella Everhardt, widow of Charles Everhardt,\r\nand a daughter of N. D. West, a native of New Jersey, who settled in\r\nKansas in the early territorial days.\r\n\r\nMr. Potter is politically allied with the Republican party and is a\r\nsupporter of Republican principles. He belongs to the Christian church,\r\nand is fraternally affiliated with the Modern Woodmen of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BENJAMIN F. SHAW.\r\n\r\nBenjamin F. Shaw, hardware merchant, of Potter, Kan., is a native of\r\nAtchison county, and is one of Potter’s younger successful business men.\r\nHe was born October 11, 1882, on a farm in this county. He is a son of\r\nHenry and Martha (Nelson) Shaw, the former a native of Roodhouse, Ill.,\r\nand the latter of Missouri. Both parents are of English ancestry. Henry\r\nShaw came to Kansas in 1867 when a young man twenty years of age. When\r\nhe came here he had a cash capital of about $100. He was of a saving\r\ndisposition, however, and it was not long until he became the owner of a\r\nfine farm of 320 acres in Leavenworth county, Kansas. He is now residing\r\nin Leavenworth, living on a small farm of twenty acres within the city\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nBenjamin F. is the fourth of six children born to Henry and Martha Shaw,\r\nand is the only son. He spent his boyhood days on his father’s farm and\r\nattended the district school in his neighborhood. When nineteen years of\r\nage he came to Potter and entered the employ of L. M. Jewell, in his\r\ngeneral merchandise store. He began working for a salary of sixteen\r\ndollars per month. When Mr. Jewell took charge of the Potter State Bank\r\nas cashier, Mr. Shaw was placed in charge of the Jewell lumber yard and\r\nfurniture store. Shortly afterward he was enabled to purchase a half\r\ninterest in the furniture store. Within a year he sold his interest in\r\nthe furniture business and bought a half interest in the hardware store\r\nof J. C. Helvey. Upon Mr. Helvey’s death, three years later, Mr. Shaw\r\npurchased his former partner’s interest, and has since conducted the\r\nbusiness entirely in his own name, as the sole proprietor. Mr. Shaw has\r\nmet with signal success in his business venture, and has grown with the\r\ntown of Potter. He has increased the value of the hardware stock in his\r\nestablishment from $2,200 to over $7,000. In addition to his business he\r\nis the owner of farm lands near the town of Potter. This is a\r\nconsiderable accomplishment for a young man who began his career with\r\npractically no capital, but a willingness to do the best he could, and\r\nendowed with plenty of energy and intelligence.\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw was married in November of 1904 to Miss Louise Bessler, of\r\nLeavenworth, Kan. His political affiliations are with the Democratic\r\nparty, and he is fraternally connected with the Modern Woodmen lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LAWRENCE GRIFFIN.\r\n\r\nA review of the life of the late Lawrence Griffin, of Effingham, Kan.,\r\nis the story of a poor Irish lad who left his native land, served his\r\nadopted country in the Civil war, became a pioneer in Kansas, and was a\r\nrailroad builder and successful farmer, and in the course of years\r\nrealized in full his boyhood dream of wealth and position in the great,\r\nfree land of America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _L. Griffin_\r\n]\r\n\r\nLawrence Griffin was born in County Galway, Ireland, in 1838, a son of\r\npoor Irish parents. When a boy in his teens he immigrated to America and\r\njoined his brother, Michael, in Ohio, and there engaged in farm work for\r\na living. He worked his way westward, and at the outbreak of the Civil\r\nwar was driving a stage coach out of Springfield, Ill., where he\r\nenlisted August 3, 1862, in Company C, Twenty-seventh regiment, Illinois\r\ninfantry, and served until his honorable discharge, September 20, 1864.\r\nHe fought in many important battles, among them being Belmont, Mo.,\r\nUnion City, siege and capture of Island No. 10, Farmington Mills, siege\r\nand capture of Vicksburg, Lookout Mountain, Mission Ridge, and the\r\nbattle of Chattanooga. After the war he went to St. Louis, Mo., and from\r\nthat city made his way to Atchison, where he took a contract under J. P.\r\nBrown for building a portion of the grade of the Central Branch\r\nrailroad, at that time under course of construction. His first job was\r\nthe grading of one mile of road called section 20 in partnership with a\r\nMr. Keean. In partnership with James Brady he then graded two miles of\r\nroad near Wetmore, Kan. He saved his money which he made from his\r\ngrading operations and in 1867 was married and purchased a farm of\r\neighty acres near Arrington on the creek bottoms. He was compelled to\r\nleave this place after one year on account of ague and invested in 160\r\nacres of land north of Arrington, which he later sold and bought 160\r\nacres of higher land four miles west of Effingham. This was prairie land\r\nwhich he at once began to improve and made into a permanent home for his\r\nfamily. He and his wife first lived in a small house and were often\r\ndiscouraged and faced failure many times, but persistence and fortitude\r\nfinally won out and they became the possessors of 400 acres of well\r\nimproved land on which were erected two sets of farm buildings. Three\r\nhundred and twenty acres yet remain intact of the original holdings,\r\nwhich are rented to tenants. In 1908 Mr. and Mrs. Griffin left the farm\r\nand purchased a handsome residence in Effingham where Mrs. Griffin now\r\nresides.\r\n\r\nMr. Griffin was married November 25, 1865, in the old St. Benedict’s\r\nChurch in Atchison, to Miss Ellen Gallagher, the marriage ceremony being\r\nperformed by Father Timothy. Ten children have blessed this union, as\r\nfollows: Michael died in infancy; Martin Lawrence, a farmer at Wetmore,\r\nKan.; Ellen, wife of James Bergen, Graham county, Kansas; Elizabeth,\r\nwife of Michael Murphy, Dallas, Texas; Anna, at home with her mother;\r\nPatrick Henry, conducting a livery business at Effingham; John J.,\r\ncultivating the home farm; Frank, agent for the Southern Life Insurance\r\nCompany, Wichita Falls, Texas; Walter L., a traveling salesman, Dallas,\r\nTexas, and who graduated from the Atchison County High School, and\r\nstudied two years at St. Benedict’s College; James Ambrose, also a\r\ngraduate of the Atchison County High School, and now a stenographer in\r\nthe office with his brother at Dallas, Texas. The mother of these\r\nchildren was born September 15, 1850, at La Salle, Ill., a daughter of\r\nMartin and Anne (Corcoran) Gallagher, both of whom were born in County\r\nMayo, Ireland. They came to this country when young and Mr. Gallagher\r\ntook up a homestead in Illinois and also engaged in freighting from La\r\nSalle to Chicago. He died in 1851, and the widow, accompanied by Ellen\r\nand two sons, came to Atchison county in 1860 and made their home here.\r\nMrs. Gallagher married again, her second husband being Frank Cullen, who\r\npreëmpted land near Muscotah, upon which the family moved from Atchison\r\nin 1863. Mr. Cullen died in 1888. The mother of Mrs. Griffin died in\r\n1890, at the age of sixty-six years.\r\n\r\nLawrence Griffin was a member of the Catholic church and was always a\r\nliberal contributor to the support of that denomination, giving\r\nsubstantially in aid of the building of the Catholic church in\r\nEffingham. While he was a rough and ready type of man who took the world\r\nas he found it, he was very moral and believed in living according to\r\nthe golden rule. He was very charitable to the poor and worthy and was a\r\nkind husband, and a loving and indulgent father, whose sole aim in\r\namassing a comfortable fortune was to provide well for his wife and\r\nchildren. In this aim he succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHARLES E. BARKER.\r\n\r\nThe Nation owes a debt to the veterans of the Civil war, who gave the\r\nbest years of their young lives to the defense of the Union, and marched\r\nunder the star-spangled banner under the leadership of such heroes as\r\nGrant, Sherman and Sheridan, which can never be fully repaid. The ranks\r\nof the grand army of brave and true men who have worn the blue are\r\ngradually thinning out, and where once they were numbered in hundreds\r\nand thousands throughout this broad land, there are now but few in each\r\ncommunity. These veterans were of the salt of the earth, and no better\r\ntype of manhood ever trod the earth or marched to the strains of martial\r\nmusic than the old guard, which saved the Union, at the call of Abraham\r\nLincoln. Living on a farm, in the northwest part of Benton township,\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, is a survivor of General Sherman’s victorious\r\n“march to the sea.” Comrade Charles E. Barker gave three years of his\r\nlife in the defense of the Union and flag, and has a war record which\r\nhas been equalled or surpassed by but few men who shouldered a musket to\r\nsave the Union from dissolution.\r\n\r\nCharles E. Barker, well-to-do farmer, of Atchison county, Kansas, was\r\nborn in Fulton county, Illinois, April 4, 1842, a son of John and\r\nEleanor (Rutledge) Barker. The father of Charles was born in Virginia\r\nJuly 20, 1786, and learned the blacksmith’s trade when yet a boy. He\r\nmigrated to Fulton county, Illinois, as early as 1826, and there\r\noperated a blacksmith shop. He was twice married, his second wife being\r\nEleanor Rutledge, who bore him three children: George R., deceased;\r\nJames Lee, deceased: Charles E. The four children by the first marriage\r\nwere Joseph, John W., Sarah, and Elizabeth, deceased. The mother of\r\nCharles E. was born in Greenbrier county, Virginia, November 28, 1801,\r\nand died September 3, 1873. John Barker died in Fulton county, Illinois,\r\nin September of 1861.\r\n\r\nCharles E. Barker grew up on his father’s farm, and helped in the shop\r\nand on the farm until his enlistment, at the age of twenty years. At the\r\noutbreak of the war he harkened to Lincoln’s call for volunteers to\r\nquell the rebellion of the Southern States, and went to Vermont, Ill.,\r\nwhere he enlisted in Company F, One Hundred and third regiment, Illinois\r\ninfantry, August 14, 1862, under the command of General Sherman, and Mr.\r\nBarker acted as commissary sergeant in Tennessee and the South. He\r\nparticipated in the following engagements: Vicksburg, Mission Ridge,\r\nKenesaw Mountain, Resaca, Ga., Peachtree Creek, Ga., Dallas,\r\nGristleville, November 26, 1864, and many others, his regiment being in\r\ntwenty-seven battles in all. He marched under Sherman’s banner from\r\nAtlanta to the sea, and then marched in the Grand Review at Washington,\r\nD. C. He was honorably discharged at Chicago, Ill., July 7, 1865. He\r\nreturned home after his discharge, and remained in Fulton county,\r\nIllinois, until 1883, when he disposed of his holdings there and went to\r\nDade county, Missouri, where he bought a farm. He remained in Dade\r\ncounty for several years, living on various farms which he bought and\r\nsold. In August, 1887, he went to Furnace county, Nebraska, and\r\npurchased a half section of land, to which he added 160 acres later,\r\nwhich he sold in 1903 to his son, Harry. On March 1, 1891, he went to\r\nBrown county, Kansas, and lived there until his removal to Atchison\r\ncounty. In 1894 he came to Atchison county, Kansas, and bought 160 acres\r\nof land in the northwest corner of Benton township. He improved this\r\nfarm and cultivated it with profit to himself. He maintains good graded\r\nlive stock on his acreage and is considered one of the really successful\r\nagriculturists of the county. Nearly all of his land is sown to alfalfa\r\nand grasses.\r\n\r\nOn April 19, 1866, Mr. Barker was married to Mary E. Pontious, who has\r\nborne him six children, as follows: Leonard, a farmer, of Norton county,\r\nKansas; Ira C., of Gooding, Idaho; Harry E., living in Brown county,\r\nKansas; William L., a farmer, of Kapioma township, Atchison county,\r\nKansas; Perry, residing in Stanford, Neb.; Nora, deceased. The mother of\r\nthese children was born in Ohio, a daughter of Andrew and Ann (Bear)\r\nPontious, natives of Germany.\r\n\r\nMr. Barker is a Democrat of the old school, and is a firm believer in\r\nDemocratic principles. He belongs to the Grand Army of the Republic,\r\nEffingham Post, and numbers among the members of this organization many\r\nwarm friends and comrades. He has taken his place in the community as a\r\nrepresentative citizen, who enjoys the respect and esteem of all who\r\nknow him. He can look back over his three score and thirteen years of\r\nlife with satisfaction and realize with complacency that it has been\r\nwell spent, and he has accomplished all that any good American could\r\nwish for on this earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOHN E. SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\nIf a man has the inherent ability and energy in his makeup to enable him\r\nto succeed, he is going to do it. The life stories of all successful,\r\nself-made men bear out this contention, and there are numberless\r\ninstances of success among the younger generation in the West which are\r\nwell worth recounting. John E. Sullivan, real estate dealer, loan and\r\ninsurance agent, of Effingham, Kansas, is a representative example of\r\nthe class referred to in the foregoing statement. Mr. Sullivan was\r\ndestined to succeed in his farming and business ventures, and, while a\r\nyoung man, he has already made his mark in the world, and is one of the\r\nsubstantial and influential citizens of Atchison county.\r\n\r\nJohn E. Sullivan was born on a farm, near Rulo, Richardson county,\r\nNebraska, January 20, 1873. He is a son of Murty and Mary (Rawley)\r\nSullivan, substantial and well respected citizens of Effingham. The\r\nformer was born in Ireland in 1847, and the latter is a native of\r\nCanada, born of Irish parents in 1852. Murty Sullivan left Ireland in\r\n1865, immigrated to America and settled near Rulo, Neb. He made his own\r\nway in this country, and accumulated a large farm in Nebraska, on which\r\nhe resided until 1910, when he removed to Effingham and purchased a farm\r\nadjoining the town on the south. Murty and Mary Sullivan are the parents\r\nof the following children: James and Murty, Jr., living at Hardin,\r\nMont.; Daniel D., a farmer, of Benton township, Atchison county, Kan.;\r\nJohn E., the subject of this review; Mrs. John Vogel, of Falls City,\r\nNeb.; Sister M. Teresa, a sister of the Ursuline Convent, of York, Neb.,\r\nand a teacher in St. Angela’s Academy there. The family are all members\r\nof the Catholic church.\r\n\r\nJohn E. received his primary education in the common schools of his\r\nnative county in Nebraska, and finished his education in St. Benedict’s\r\nCollege, Atchison, Kan., graduating from the commercial department of\r\nthat institution in 1894. He then took a special teachers’ course at the\r\nLincoln, Neb., Normal School. He taught school for seven years in\r\nRichardson county, Nebraska, and practically all of his teaching was\r\ndone in two schools of his home county. Upon his marriage in 1897 he\r\nengaged in farming in Nebraska, and it is a matter of pride with Mr.\r\nSullivan that he earned more money in two years of farming operations\r\nthan he had in all of his seven years of teaching, another reason why\r\nthe farm is the best place for a young and ambitious man to make money.\r\nHis success as a farmer determined his future career, and he decided to\r\nstick to the agricultural country for all time, imbued with the belief\r\nthat there is money to be earned in farming, or in handling farm lands.\r\nHe left Nebraska in December of 1901, and came to Atchison county,\r\nKansas, where he purchased a farm, one and one-half miles south of\r\nEffingham, his first farm being the northwest quarter of section 34–618.\r\nHe is at present the owner of 400 acres of well improved land which is\r\nkept in a high state of cultivation by improved methods of farming. Mr.\r\nSullivan raises considerable live stock on his acreage and aims to feed\r\nall the grain raised on the land to live stock. He specializes in\r\nHereford cattle and Poland China hogs and aims to keep only good grade\r\nof stock of all kinds. At the time of his purchase of the farm land in\r\nAtchison county, the land itself was in poor condition, and the soil had\r\nbecome impoverished by continual cropping of a single staple. Through\r\nthe modern method of crop rotation Mr. Sullivan is reviving the\r\nfertility of the soil, and at the present time the greater portion of\r\nhis farm is planted to clover and grasses, for the purpose of renewing\r\nthe strength of the soil, the process being assisted by the raising and\r\nfeeding of live stock on the place. The Sullivan farm has splendid\r\nimprovements, which were placed on it by Mr. Sullivan, who erected a\r\nmodern eight-room house and a good barn. In 1907 Mr. Sullivan was\r\ninduced to take up insurance work as a side line, in the interest of a\r\nNebraska insurance company, and met with great success in his new line\r\nof work. He later took up the real estate business and the handling of\r\nloans, and has been likewise successful in establishing a permanent\r\nbusiness which requires his attention and necessitates an office in\r\nEffingham. The Sullivan real estate and loan office is well located in\r\nthe Farmers and Merchants State Bank, of which concern Mr. Sullivan\r\nserved as cashier and a director for several years.\r\n\r\nHe was married February 16, 1897, to Mary Majerus, a native born\r\nresident of Richardson county, Nebraska, and a daughter of Jacob and\r\nElizabeth (Wilker) Majerus, the former a native of Germany, and the\r\nlatter of Ohio, of German parents. Seven children have blessed this\r\nunion, namely: P. Justin, aged seventeen, and a student of St.\r\nBenedict’s College, class of 1916; Leo, aged thirteen years; Nellie, ten\r\nyears old; Elizabeth, aged eight; Edward, six years old; Agnes, three\r\nyears of age; and Mary, born January 28, 1915.\r\n\r\nMr. Sullivan is a Democrat who takes an active and influential part in\r\nthe affairs of his party in Atchison county, having been the candidate\r\nof the party for county treasurer in 1914. He is fraternally affiliated\r\nwith the Modern Woodmen, of Effingham, the Knights of Columbus, of\r\nAtchison, and the Central Protective Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SAMUEL L. LOYD.\r\n\r\nSamuel L. Loyd, an enterprising and successful farmer, of Shannon\r\ntownship, was born June 11, 1860, in Brown county, Ohio, a son of Thomas\r\nF. and Celina (McGinness) Loyd, natives of Kentucky and Ohio,\r\nrespectively. His paternal ancestors were of Welsh extraction. William\r\nLoyd, grandfather of Samuel Loyd, after making a home for his family in\r\nthis country, started on a return trip to his native land, in order to\r\nsecure a legacy which had been willed to him by a deceased relative, and\r\non the way was afflicted with cholera, and died. With his death,\r\npractically all knowledge of the family in the old country passed away,\r\nand his widow and two children were left to get along as best they\r\ncould. Two years later the widow died. Thomas F. Loyd was reared by a\r\nMr. Boyd, and removed from Kentucky to Brown county, Ohio, when he\r\nbecame of age, and there married Celina McGinness. About 1865 he set out\r\nfor the western country to obtain cheaper land, and make a permanent\r\nhome for his family. After living for one year in Clark county,\r\nMissouri, he loaded his effects on a covered wagon, and with his wife\r\nand children crossed the Missouri river at St. Joseph, and settled on a\r\nfarm in Doniphan county, Kansas, April 14, 1866. Thomas F. Loyd was a\r\nmember of the Home Guard in Brown county, Ohio, during the Civil war. He\r\nwas born in 1825, and died in 1910. His wife, Celina, was born in 1829,\r\nand died in 1906. They were the parents of ten children, seven of whom\r\nare living: William, Mollie, deceased, Charles, deceased, Samuel L.,\r\nAnna, George, Effie, Otis, Oscar, and Celina, deceased.\r\n\r\nSamuel L. Loyd was six years of age when his parents located in Doniphan\r\ncounty, and consequently knows a great deal about the early days in\r\nKansas, and the struggles of the early settlers to make homes on the\r\nprairie. He was brought up on the farm, and attended the district school\r\nwhen possible, and learned very early in life to do farm work. After his\r\nmarriage he farmed in Doniphan county until 1899, when he came to\r\nShannon township in Atchison county, and purchased 160 acres of fine\r\nland, which he has brought to a high state of cultivation. During his\r\nsixteen years of residence here he has improved his farm to a\r\nconsiderable extent, and has spent over $5,000 in the erection of a\r\nhandsome brick residence which sets far back on a rise of ground and is\r\nreached from the highway by a private driveway. Other improvements on\r\nthe place in the way of buildings and fences have cost him over $1,500.\r\nA severe storm, which swept this section May 3, 1903, did damage to the\r\nextent of over $500 to his buildings, and he found it necessary to\r\nrepair all of this.\r\n\r\nMr. Loyd was married September 2, 1896, to Miss Lulu Voelker, born and\r\nbrought up in Atchison county, a few miles north of the city of\r\nAtchison. To this union five children have been born: Myrtle Ceina, Edna\r\nLula, good educations by their ambitious parents. Mrs. Loyd is a sister\r\nof Conrad Voelker, a wealthy and prominent farmer residing on one of the\r\nfinest farms in the county, about four miles north of Atchison, and who\r\nearned the title of “Cabbage King” of Kansas, because of his wonderful\r\nsuccess in growing that vegetable some years ago. Mrs. Loyd was born\r\nJuly 14, 1872, and is a daughter of Karl Voelker, who immigrated to this\r\ncountry from Germany in 1861, and operated a dairy and truck farm in\r\nShannon township for several years. The mother of Mrs. Loyd was\r\nChristina Neuhaus, of German parents. Further details of the history of\r\nthe Voelker family are found elsewhere in this volume. Conrad M., a\r\nnephew of Mrs. Loyd, is county clerk of Atchison county.\r\n\r\nMr. Loyd is a Republican, but gives little or no attention to political\r\naffairs, other than to vote as his conscience dictates. He is affiliated\r\nwith the Central Protective Association, and is a member of Good Intent\r\nlodge, of Shannon township. While Mrs. Loyd was reared in the Lutheran\r\nfaith, the members of the Loyd family attend the Methodist church. For a\r\nman who was forced to make his own way in the world, Mr. Loyd, with the\r\nassistance of his faithful wife, has accomplished a great deal, for\r\nwhich he deserves credit and honor among his neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JULIUS KAAZ.\r\n\r\nThe life story of Julius Kaaz, founder and proprietor of the\r\nmanufacturing concern which bears his name, is an account of the\r\nachievements of a self-made man who left his native land to seek\r\nopportunity and fortune in Atchison, and found it. During the period of\r\nthirty-four years of his life which has been spent in his adopted city,\r\nMr. Kaaz has succeeded even beyond his expectations and has made a place\r\nfor himself an enviable one in the city. He arrived in Atchison in 1881\r\nwithout a dollar, but endowed with a willingness to do whatever came to\r\nhand, imbued with a desire to succeed where the opportunity awaited him.\r\nThe Julius Kaaz Manufacturing Company is a monument to his industry and\r\nambition. This is one of the thriving and important establishments in\r\nthe city of Atchison, and is widely known as one of the city’s leading\r\nindustries. The extensive plant covers two floors of a building, 52×130\r\nfeet, and from eighteen to twenty men are employed in the mill proper,\r\nand from five to thirty-five men are given employment at outside work.\r\nThe factory is conveniently located at 1200–1208 Main street and is\r\nfully equipped with all modern machinery to facilitate the manufacture\r\nof the high grade products which consist principally of bank, church and\r\nstore fixtures, made to the order of the purchaser. An example of the\r\nhigh grade work turned out by the Kaaz plant can be seen in the interior\r\nfixings and furniture of the German-American State Bank of Atchison. Mr.\r\nKaaz ships his output to Kansas and Nebraska cities and all parts of the\r\nUnited States, and it is unsurpassed in quality and finish.\r\n\r\nJulius Kaaz was born March 26, 1854, in Prussia, German Empire, a son of\r\nDaniel and Christina (Schroeder) Kaaz, who were the parents of four\r\nchildren: Wilhelmina Loeproeck, a widow residing in Atchison county;\r\nErnest, Atchison; Mrs. Christina Schmeling, deceased; Julius, the\r\nyoungest of the family. Daniel Kaaz was a carpenter by trade and came to\r\nAtchison from Germany with his family in 1881. He resided with his son\r\nJulius upon his retirement from active labor until his death in 1902.\r\nHis wife, Christina, was born in 1821, and died in 1895.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Jul. Kaaz_\r\n]\r\n\r\nJulius Kaaz attended the schools of his native land and studied\r\narchitecture. He learned the trade of carpenter under his father, but\r\ncould not content himself to settle down in his native land and follow\r\nin the footsteps of his forebears. When still a young man the germ of\r\nambition called him to other lands, and his goal was America. His desire\r\nto better his condition led him to set sail for this country in 1881,\r\narriving in Atchison, where he at once sought employment. His first work\r\nwas cutting cordwood in the timber land, south of the city, during the\r\nwinter, and in the spring of the following year he worked on the\r\nMissouri river, making and placing riprap. Soon afterward he was given a\r\njob working at his trade for $1.50 per day. For one year he worked for\r\nwages, and at length decided to embark in business for himself and began\r\ntaking contracts at a time when he had no capital worth speaking of. It\r\nwas even necessary for him to borrow the saw and hammer which he used in\r\nhis work. In 1885 he formed a partnership with Henry Braun in the\r\ncontracting business which continued until 1909, when they dissolved\r\npartnership. In 1907 Mr. Kaaz erected his first planing mill which has\r\ngrown into his present extensive establishment consisting of plant,\r\nyards and warerooms.\r\n\r\nHe was married to Ida Schmeling in 1883, and to this union have been\r\nborn nine children, as follows: Emil, Lena, Robert, Lydia, Julius E.,\r\nOtto, Fred, Arthur, Martha. Of these children Martha is deceased, Lydia\r\nis her father’s secretary, Fred is also employed in the office, and Otto\r\nH. is employed in the mill. Mrs. Kaaz was born September 6, 1856, in\r\nPrussia, German Empire, and is a daughter of August and Ernestine\r\n(Polzien) Schmeling. She left her native land when sixteen years of age\r\nand came to Atchison.\r\n\r\nMr. Kaaz, while politically allied with the Republican party, is an\r\nindependent voter who believes in voting for the individual who seems to\r\nbe most capable of serving the people, rather than supporting an avowed\r\npolitician. He and the members of his family are affiliated with the\r\nGerman Lutheran church and are liberal supporters of this denomination.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GEORGE W. REDMOND, M. D.\r\n\r\nA greater service in behalf of mankind than a life devoted to healing\r\nthe sick and curing the halt and the lame can not be considered, and\r\nwhen this service has been rendered far from the comforts of the city\r\nand during the storms of many seasons in the open country from the\r\npioneer era in Kansas down to the present time, the value of such\r\nservice to humanity is inestimable. The unsung heroes of the medical\r\nfraternity are the large class of country practitioners who go their way\r\nyear after year, uncomplainingly and satisfied with the good they are\r\ndoing for their fellow creatures. Great fortune is not theirs, but the\r\ninevitable reward and the satisfaction of a task well and faithfully\r\ndone is theirs to have. Of this great class the biographer is pleased to\r\nrecord the facts concerning the life and career of George W. Redmond,\r\nthe second oldest physician in Atchison county, and one of the oldest\r\nmedical men in Kansas. For nearly half a century Dr. Redmond has\r\npracticed his profession among the tillers of the soil in the\r\nneighborhood of Potter, and the southeastern part of Atchison county,\r\nand in the northeast part of Leavenworth county, Kansas. During all this\r\ntime he has remained true to his calling, and resisted the call of the\r\ntowns and cities, where an easier life might be lived. He has likewise\r\nprogressed with the profession and endeavored to keep abreast of the\r\nwonderful developments in the science of medicine, arriving at the point\r\nin his career where he is a specialist in his profession.\r\n\r\nDr. George W. Redmond was born in Bourbon county, Kentucky, October 19,\r\n1849, a son of Oscar Redmond and Susan (Orr) Redmond, the former a\r\nnative of Bourbon county, and the latter a native of Nicholas county,\r\nKentucky. Both were born in the same year, 1820, and the mother of Dr.\r\nRedmond was a daughter of William Orr, a captain in the American army in\r\nthe War of 1812. William migrated to Kentucky from Pennsylvania shortly\r\nafter peace was declared between England and the United States, and was\r\none of the pioneers of that State. Oscar F. Redmond, father of George\r\nW., was a son of William Redmond, was also one of the pioneers in the\r\nsettlement of old Kentucky. Both the Orr and Redmond families were of\r\nthat sturdy Scotch Presbyterian stock, who were prominent in the early\r\nhistory of Kentucky, and were noted as true pioneers in several of the\r\nmiddle Western States. Oscar F. Redmond was a farmer in Kentucky, and\r\nreared a family of twelve children, of whom George W. was the fourth\r\nchild. In 1856 the Redmond family removed to Cooper county, Missouri,\r\nwhere they remained until 1858, and then settled in Platte county,\r\nMissouri, where the father made a permanent home for many years,\r\nafterwards ending his days in Muscotah, Atchison county, Kansas. The\r\nmother of Dr. Redmond died in Kansas City in 1892.\r\n\r\nWhen the Redmond family left Kentucky, George W. was five years of age.\r\nHe received his primary education in the district schools of Platte\r\ncounty, Missouri, and graduated from the Gaylord Institute, after which\r\nhe began the study of medicine with his uncle, Dr. H. B. Redmond, in\r\nSaline county, Missouri, with whom he studied one year. He then entered\r\nthe St. Louis Medical College, of St. Louis, Mo., completed the\r\nprescribed two years course, and graduated therefrom in 1869. While\r\ntrying to decide upon a location, and almost having his mind set upon a\r\ncity location, he received a letter from his sister, Mrs. Samuel E.\r\nKing, in Atchison county, informing him that Dr. John Parsons, of Mt.\r\nPleasant, was in need of a young assistant and partner, and he could\r\nhave the place if he came to Kansas. This letter decided his course, and\r\nhe came at once to Atchison county and began his practice with Dr.\r\nParsons. At this period Mt. Pleasant was an important inland town, but\r\nit has long since passed into the realm of “disappeared cities.” Dr.\r\nRedmond remained in Mt. Pleasant a little over two years, and then\r\nlocated in Oak Mills, where he owned a farm, and built up an enormous\r\nmedical practice in the village and surrounding countryside. He\r\npracticed in Oak Mills for thirty years, although prevailed upon by his\r\nmany admirers in Atchison to remove to the larger city and open an\r\noffice. During the winter of 1903 and 1904 he pursued a post-graduate\r\ncourse in the post-graduate school of Chicago, and upon his return to\r\nKansas, in the spring of 1904, he located in Potter, Atchison county. Of\r\nlate years Dr. Redmond has become a specialist in the diseases of women,\r\nand it is in this branch of practice that he is achieving his greatest\r\nsuccesses. Obstetrics has long been his specialty, and he undoubtedly\r\nholds the record in Kansas for the number of successful confinement\r\ncases at which he has officiated, and it can be said of him, that in all\r\nof his many years of practice he has never lost a confinement case,\r\nalthough there have been times in his career when he has had three and\r\nfour cases of this character in one day.\r\n\r\nDr. Redmond has been twice married, his first marriage occurring in 1874\r\nwith Anna Douglass, a daughter of J. M. and Sarah Douglass, who were\r\namong the earliest of the Atchison county pioneers. Four children\r\nblessed this union: Ethel, of Leavenworth, Kan.; Edith, wife of Charles\r\nMunger, of Atchison county, Kansas; Virginia, living in Leavenworth,\r\nKan.; Georgia Redmond, also residing in Leavenworth. Dr. Redmond’s\r\nsecond marriage took place in 1906 with Carrie A. Sprong, a daughter of\r\nD. H. Sprong, an early pioneer settler of Kansas, a sketch of whom\r\nappears in this volume.\r\n\r\nWhile Dr. Redmond is a Democrat in politics, he has never found the time\r\nto take an active part in political affairs. For the past thirty-five\r\nyears he has been a contributor to various medical journals, among them\r\nbeing the _Medical World_, of Philadelphia, one of the oldest and most\r\nwidely read medical publications in the United States. He is a member of\r\nthe Atchison County Medical Society, the Kansas State Medical Society,\r\nand the American Medical Association, and was one of the organizers of\r\nthe county society in 1869, and is the only surviving original member of\r\nthe society. He is a member of Kickapoo Lodge, No. 4, Ancient Free and\r\nAccepted Masons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FREDERICK W. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nFrom small beginnings larger things very often naturally grow. The candy\r\nand soft drink manufactory of Frederick W. Lincoln on South Fifth\r\nstreet, Atchison, had its inception in a very modest beginning. In fact,\r\nMr. Lincoln first began manufacturing his fine candies at his residence,\r\ncorner of Seventh and S streets, but the constant growth of the concern\r\nsoon required larger quarters, and his present factory, erected in 1893,\r\nis the result of his enterprise, a building 20×60 feet in extent, with\r\nthe basement in use. He employs ten people the year round, and is his\r\nown traveling salesman, his son, Edward, having charge of the business\r\nduring his father’s absence on the road. The products of the Lincoln\r\nfactory are in demand, and are noted for their excellency. In 1912 the\r\nmanufacture of soda and soft drinks was added to supply a demand in\r\nAtchison and the surrounding territory. The manufactured goods of the\r\nLincoln factory are distributed to all points in Kansas and western\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nFrederick W. Lincoln was born in England January 29, 1852, a son of\r\nEdmund B. and Jane (Barrell) Lincoln, the father being born in Norfolk,\r\nIntwood county, England, and the mother being a native of County\r\nClingford, England. They were the parents of four children: Edward, a\r\nveteran of the Civil war, and inmate of the National Soldiers’ Home at\r\nSandusky, Ohio; Mrs. Mary King, of Michigan; Mrs. Emily S. Moffit,\r\ndeceased; Frederick W., with whom this review is directly concerned, and\r\nwho was reared by an uncle, Mr. Barrell, who taught him the baker’s\r\ntrade. The Lincoln family immigrated to America in 1853, and settled in\r\nOhio, where Frederick was reared to manhood in the home of his uncle. He\r\nworked at his trade of baker until 1875, when he came to Atchison, and\r\nwas employed in the hardware store of W. W. Marlborough for a few years,\r\nafter which he worked in a candy shop for W. B. Howe, who taught him the\r\ncandy maker’s trade. About 1880 he embarked in the manufacture of\r\ncandies with T. L. White, with whom he was associated for a short time,\r\nand eventually engaged in business for himself, starting in his home,\r\nmaking a very modest beginning. His first shop was near his residence,\r\nbut the business soon outgrew the demands made upon the little shop, and\r\nlarger quarters soon became necessary. The business is the direct\r\noutcome of the persistence, integrity and industry of the proprietor,\r\nand the future of this flourishing concern is bright with promise, as\r\nthe years see it extend its natural field, and it achieves a natural and\r\ndeserving growth.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was married January 26, 1879, to Laura Averill, born July\r\n20, at Cooper, Maine, a daughter of Joseph and Julia A. (Whitney)\r\nAverill, natives of England and Scotland respectively. Mrs. Lincoln came\r\nto Atchison with her mother and resided with her stepfather and mother\r\nuntil her marriage with Mr. Lincoln. To Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln have been\r\nborn the following children: Mrs. Leona Andrews, of Atchison; Edward E.,\r\nborn May 11, 1883, educated in the public and high schools of Atchison\r\nand brought up with his father in the business, married in 1903 to Freda\r\nSpatz, who was born November 9, 1896, in Atchison, a daughter of Jacob\r\nand Josephine (Latenser) Spatz, natives of Germany and St. Joseph, Mo.,\r\nrespectively; the third child being Frank, a machinist, employed at\r\nHorton, Kan.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln is a Republican, and is fraternally allied with the Ancient\r\nOrder of United Workmen, the United Commercial Travelers, and the Modern\r\nWoodmen of America. He and the members of his family belong to the\r\nChristian church. Mr. Lincoln’s career is an exemplification of the\r\nadage, “Success never comes to him who waits,” and his standing in the\r\ncommercial life of Atchison today is due to the fact that he made his\r\nopportunity and is justly entitled to proper recognition as one of the\r\ncity’s leading factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOHN C. VALENTINE.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Valentine, owner and proprietor of the Northern Kansas Telephone\r\nCompany of Effingham, for more than forty years has been a resident of\r\nAtchison county. The Northern Kansas Telephone Company, of which he is\r\nthe head, was organized in 1903 as a coöperative concern, but is now\r\nowned and operated by Mr. Valentine and his son, A. G. Valentine.

Valentine is a native of Dearborn county, Indiana, and was born\r\nin the Hoosier State July 28, 1845, a son of George and Sarah\r\n(Cornforth) Valentine. His father was born in New Jersey, and\r\naccompanied his parents to the Middle West, locating in Cincinnati when\r\nGeorge was a child. He was reared in Cincinnati, and later settled in\r\nIndiana. His mother was the daughter of pioneer stock of English\r\ndescent, and was connected with the Eubanks family, which figured in the\r\nearly history of Indiana. Sarah Valentine died in 1863, and George\r\nmarried again, after which he settled in Illinois, and died near Xenia,\r\nthat State. He was a soldier in the Civil war, and served in an Ohio\r\ncavalry regiment throughout the conflict. John C. Valentine enlisted in\r\nthe 134th regiment, Indiana infantry, in the spring of 1864, and served\r\nuntil his honorable discharge in the fall of the same year. His health\r\nbecame poor while serving in Tennessee, and he was transferred to\r\nLouisville, Ky., and sent home from that city. He was kept on the\r\nreserve force while serving in Alabama, and was in the breastworks at\r\nDecatur, Ala. At this place he was exposed to a hot fire, and recalls\r\nthat it was a very uncomfortable place in which to be. During the winter\r\nof 1866 he taught school in Decatur county, Indiana. He remained at home\r\nwith an uncle, William Sawdon, at Aurora, Ind., after returning from the\r\nwar, until September, 1867, at which time he went to Ft. Madison, Iowa,\r\nand there met some friends. He worked on farms in the neighborhood until\r\nChristmas of that year, and then left for Kansas, arriving at\r\nLeavenworth January 1, 1868.\r\n\r\nDuring his first year in Kansas he broke prairie land for a living; the\r\nnext year he sold sewing machines, and made good at that avocation; the\r\nsecond year, winter of 1868–69, he taught school in Leavenworth county,\r\nand two years after coming to this State he was married. He and his\r\nbrother, Charles, broke prairie with their two teams in Jefferson\r\ncounty, and for four years after his marriage, Mr. Valentine had great\r\nsuccess in farming in that county, raising immense crops of wheat. In\r\nthe year 1874 he came to Atchison county and settled on a farm four\r\nmiles northwest of Effingham on the south side of the Parallel road. He\r\nat first bought a tract of eighty acres and erected a small house on his\r\nland, erecting other buildings as he was able. Mr. Valentine has\r\nprospered in the years following his first purchase of land in this\r\ncounty, and he and his son now own a total of 200 acres of well improved\r\nland. He resided on the farm until January of 1896, then turned over the\r\nfarm to the management of his son, and came to Effingham. For ten years\r\nfollowing he traveled as salesman, and in 1905 engaged in the telephone\r\nbusiness by the purchase of the coöperative company which formerly owned\r\nthe lines he is now operating.\r\n\r\nMr. Valentine was married April 7, 1870, to Miss Lena Smith, of Johnson\r\ncounty, Kansas, who was born in 1855. The children born to this union\r\nare: Albert G., on the home farm, married Alice Frame, and is the father\r\nof one son and five daughters; Mrs. Mattie Stevenson, of near Beloit,\r\nKan.; Edward died at the age of twenty-two years, and Robert died at the\r\nage of thirteen years.\r\n\r\nMr. Valentine is a Republican in politics, and has always remained loyal\r\nand steadfast to the party of Abraham Lincoln. He has served as city\r\ncouncilman and mayor of Effingham. He is an Odd Fellow, and a member of\r\nthe Grand Army Post, No. 176, Effingham.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GUSTAVE STUTZ.\r\n\r\nGustave Stutz, farmer and stockman, of Atchison county, Kan., was born\r\nApril 20, 1867, in Lancaster township, this county, and is the son of\r\nChristian and Katherine (Schweitzer) Stutz. Seven children were born to\r\nthem, as follows: Caroline (Demel), of Central City, Neb.; Katherine\r\n(Wilkins), Atchison, Kan.; Frederick, policeman, Atchison, Kan.;\r\nChristopher W., Center township, Atchison county; Gustave, subject of\r\nthis sketch; John, Center township; and one child died in infancy. The\r\nfather of Gustave Stutz was born March 25, 1825, in Germany. He left\r\nthere in 1855, and settled in Jackson county, Missouri, and in 1859 came\r\nto Atchison county, where he bought eighty acres of land in Lancaster\r\ntownship. The land was timber and prairie country, and he employed a man\r\nto break it up with oxen. Mr. Stutz made extensive improvements on his\r\nfarm, and added more land from time to time. When he died, December 28,\r\n1898, he owned 380 acres of land. The mother of the subject of this\r\nsketch was born in Germany, in February, 1829. She died in Lancaster\r\ntownship in December, 1888. She is buried in Maple Grove cemetery.\r\n\r\nGustave Stutz was reared on his father’s farm and attended the public\r\nschools of Lancaster. In 1893 he rented a farm from his father for a\r\nyear, and then bought 160 acres in Center township. Five years later he\r\nsold that and bought eighty acres near the Madison school house. Having\r\nmade a number of improvements, he sold this farm and bought the present\r\none of 160 acres. When he took this land there were only a few\r\nramshackle buildings on it, but he has made it one of the most modern\r\nfarms in the State. He built a large seven-room house at a cost of\r\n$4,500, which is fitted with all modern conveniences, including hot and\r\ncold water, electric lights, bath, and a basement fitted up as a\r\nlaundry. The house is lighted by electricity, which is generated from a\r\nprivate plant located on the farm. Mr. Stutz was the first to install\r\none in Atchison county. In 1912 he built a barn, 52×46 feet, for general\r\npurposes. Mr. Stutz is a breeder of Shorthorn cattle and takes great\r\npride in his herd. He has a herd of thirty fine Shorthorn cattle,\r\nincluding four pure breds, and has been gradually improving his herd for\r\nthe purpose of embarking in the business of breeding Shorthorns for the\r\ntrade. He is a stockholder in the Independent Harvester Company, of\r\nPlano, Ill. He is a Democrat in politics, and was for a time road\r\nsupervisor of Lancaster township.\r\n\r\nMr. Stutz was married October 10, 1893, to Margaret Waltz, who was born\r\nApril 30, 1875, in Shannon township, Atchison county. She is a daughter\r\nof Charles and Margaret (Diesback) Walz, both natives of Germany. The\r\nfather died February 4, 1890, at the age of sixty-two. He immigrated\r\nfrom Germany in 1847. The mother is living in Atchison county. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Stutz are the parents of three children: Albert, born June 2, 1895;\r\nEdward, born January 3, 1898, and Pearl, born June 24, 1899, all living\r\nat home. Mr. Stutz attends the Presbyterian church, and is a member of\r\nthe Independent Order of Odd Fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THOMAS O. PLUMMER.\r\n\r\nThere is some distinction in being a pioneer in the State of Kansas, and\r\nthere is certainly considerable distinction coming to the man who can\r\njustly lay claim to being the first white child born of pioneer parents\r\nin a component part of a great county like Atchison. Thomas O. Plummer,\r\nprosperous farmer and stockman of Grasshopper township, Atchison county,\r\nis the first white child born within the borders of his township, and\r\nhas lived all of his fifty-nine years within the borders of the\r\ntownship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _T. O. Plummer and wife_\r\n]\r\n\r\nT. O. Plummer was born December 6, 1857, a son of Leven Vincent and\r\nMatilda (Norman) Plummer, both of whom were born in Kentucky. Leven\r\nVincent was a son of Lewis Plummer, a native of Germany, who immigrated\r\nto America when quite young and married a Miss Vincent in Kentucky. She\r\n(his wife) was a daughter of English parents and was a large woman. The\r\nfact that her descendants are all men of large physique is explanatory\r\nof the inheritance of strength and size which predominates in the men of\r\nthe Plummer family. The mother of Thomas O. was a daughter of Lewis\r\nNorman, a Kentucky pioneer and expert blacksmith, who was of French-\r\nEnglish descent. He (Lewis) was a maker of plows and farming implements\r\nwhich he would manufacture in his shop, load on a river boat and sell in\r\nthe towns and villages on the banks of the Ohio river. On one of his\r\ntrading expeditions he was shot by the crew of a rival trading boat.\r\n\r\nLeven Vincent Plummer was the father of eight children, as follows: Mary\r\nElizabeth Baker, Oklahoma; Dempsey died at the age of sixteen years;\r\nCharles died in 1907; Thomas O. and Benjamin F., (twins), Arrington,\r\nKan.; Leonidas, Atchison; Commodore, Oklahoma; Harriet Ratley, Cowley\r\ncounty, Kansas; Lucullus, on old home place.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1854 he left Kentucky and migrated to Platte county,\r\nMissouri, where he resided until 1855 and then made a settlement in\r\nGrasshopper township, Atchison county. He was the first white settler on\r\nBrush creek in the Kickapoo Indian reservation lands. He did his trading\r\nat old Kennekuk. It is recalled that the old Mormon trail passed by his\r\nhome and Mr. Plummer remembers the story of a large party of Mormon\r\nimmigrants being stricken with the cholera and over 100 of them died as\r\na result of the terrible attack of the dread disease. The dead bodies of\r\nthe victims were hurriedly buried in shallow graves, but, unfortunately\r\nwere rooted up by hogs owned by the Indians. Inasmuch as the white\r\nsettlers were afraid to bury the bodies again the hogs were permitted to\r\neat the bodies. Leven Plummer was on extremely good terms with the\r\nIndians of the neighborhood and several of them worked for him at\r\ndifferent times. When the Indians disposed of their land holdings to the\r\nGovernment and moved to a new reservation, he purchased of them 100 of\r\ntheir “razorback” hogs and 10,000 fence rails at a cost of ten cents a\r\nhundred rails. He hauled the rails to his place in immense wagon loads,\r\nhauled by two yoke of oxen and a team of horses. He became fairly well\r\nto do and was a large feeder of live stock, frequently feeding as high\r\nas 100 head of cattle, four-year-old steers and 400 head of hogs. He\r\ndied in 1867, at the age of forty-seven years, leaving eight children to\r\nthe care of his widow. Leven Plummer was noted as one of the strongest\r\nmen of his day and was a man of large stature who could perform feats of\r\nstrength which would appall the average man.\r\n\r\nThomas O. Plummer attended the district school of his neighborhood and\r\nwhen twenty-one years of age began for himself. His first employment\r\naway from home was for six months with Martin W. Ham. He then worked for\r\na bachelor neighbor at ten dollars per month. In 1879 he began renting\r\nland on his own account. From boyhood he has always had to hustle for\r\nhimself and has made good. He made his first purchase of land in 1893\r\nand has accumulated a total of 241 acres of well improved farm lands in\r\nGrasshopper township.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 Mr. Plummer was united in marriage with Mary Ratley, and the\r\nunion was blessed with one son, James Oliver Plummer, who is now the\r\nefficient superintendent of highways in the township. Mary (Ratley)\r\nPlummer was the daughter of John and Hannah Ratley, and departed this\r\nlife in September 15, 1887. In September of 1893, Mr. Plummer was again\r\nmarried to Miss Mary E. Clark, who has borne him one child, Thomas\r\nMcKinley Plummer, who as a youth attended the agricultural college at\r\nManhattan, Kan., and is much interested in scientific farming. Mrs. Mary\r\n(Clark) Plummer died March 13, 1908. She was a daughter of P. J. Clark,\r\na very early settler of Atchison county, and formerly a member of the\r\nAtchison city police force. The third marriage of Thomas O. Plummer\r\noccurred March 2, 1909, with Mrs. Bessie May De Bord (Floyd), widow of\r\nJames Floyd, a native of Kentucky, and to this union have been born two\r\nchildren: Theodore Ole, and Calvin Vincent Plummer. By her first\r\nmarriage, Mrs. Plummer has one child, Ruby Jewell Floyd, born September\r\n30, 1905.\r\n\r\nMr. Plummer is one of Atchison county’s best known and successful self-\r\nmade men and everything he owns has been earned by hard labor and\r\ndiligence, combined with good management. Besides his farming interests\r\nhe is a stockholder in the Farmers Grain Elevator and the Mutual\r\nTelephone Company, at Muscotah. He is a Republican in politics, and is a\r\nmember of the Mystic Workers and the Modern Woodmen of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HOWARD E. NORTH.\r\n\r\nHoward E. North, farmer, of Lancaster township, Atchison county, was\r\nborn January 25, 1867, in Walnut township, this county, and is a son of\r\nEdwin T. and Elizabeth (McCully) North, natives of New Jersey. Of the\r\neight children born to them six are living, as follows: Walter M.,\r\nAtchison, Kan.; Joseph H., of Kansas City, Mo.; Percy, of Ottawa, Kan.;\r\nClaude, Lancaster, Kan., and Mrs. Sadie Dunkle, of Los Angeles, Cal.,\r\nbesides Howard E. North, subject of this sketch. The father was born\r\nApril 23, 1830, in Burlington county, New Jersey, of English descent.\r\nLeaving there about 1865, he came west and settled in Atchison county,\r\nKansas, living one year in Walnut township, and then bought a farm in\r\nLancaster township. He made improvements, and later sold the farm to his\r\nson, Howard E., and retired in 1896. In December, 1912, he died, after\r\nhaving lived a long and useful life. The mother was born in New Jersey,\r\nas was her husband, and was born in the same year, 1830, of Scotch\r\ndescent, and died in March, 1902.\r\n\r\nHoward E. North was reared on his father’s farm, and attended the public\r\nschool at Lancaster, and also the Bell district school, No. 59. He was\r\nborn on the place which he now owns, and it has been his home since\r\nboyhood. It consists of 180 acres, and is exceptionally well improved.\r\nExtra attention has been given to stock raising facilities. Mr. North\r\ntakes a great deal of interest in fine cattle, hogs and horses, and has\r\nsome excellent Shorthorns and some valuable Poland China hogs. Mr. North\r\nhas a graded stock of horses, some of which are the best in this part of\r\nthe country. He is a stockholder in the German-American Bank at\r\nAtchison, Kan. Politically, he is a Republican, and has always been a\r\nloyal citizen, taking keen interest in the welfare of his community and\r\nhis county. He is a member of the school board of Bell district.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Mr. North was married to Alice Guyer, who was born October 1,\r\n1866, in Union county, Pennsylvania. Mrs. North was a daughter of Israel\r\nand Catharine (Brown) Guyer, natives of Pennsylvania, and who lived and\r\ndied in the land of their nativity. Mrs. Alice North came to Kansas in\r\nAugust of 1893, and joined her sister, Mrs. Annie Gemberling, who now\r\nresides in a home on the Parallel road, near Lancaster, Kan. One child,\r\nEmlin E., has been born to Mr. and Mrs. North. Mr. North is a member of\r\nthe Methodist church, and of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and\r\nModern Woodmen of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NICHOLAS BOOS.\r\n\r\nNicholas Boos, proprietor of one of the best improved farms in Shannon\r\ntownship, has resided on the land which he now owns for over fifty\r\nyears, and is widely known as a progressive farmer who has applied his\r\naccurate knowledge of the best farming methods to such good account that\r\nhe is now the owner of 250 acres of good land, upon which he erected in\r\n1912 a handsome brick residence, modern throughout, at a cost of $4,500.\r\nMr. Boos installed his own light and water plant, and in the rear of his\r\nhandsome home he has built a large and commodious bank barn. His\r\nresidence faces the main highway running northward from Atchison, and\r\npresents a substantial evidence of the enterprise of its owner.\r\n\r\nMr. Boos was born November 11, 1862, in Germany, a son of Nicholas and\r\nCatharine Boos, who left their native land with their two children and\r\ncame to Atchison county, Kansas, in July of 1865. After one month’s stay\r\nin the city they removed to a point in Shannon township, about three\r\nmiles north of Atchison, and settled upon eighty acres of land which the\r\nelder Boos purchased. Nicholas Boos and his wife reared their children\r\nhere, and lived on the farm until death called them away. Nicholas Boos,\r\nSr., was born in 1833, and died in October of 1899. Catharine, his wife,\r\nwas born in 1833, and died in November of 1898. Their two children are:\r\nNicholas, with whom this narrative is directly concerned, and Catharine,\r\nnow known as Sister Hilda of the Order of St. Benedict’s, Mt. St.\r\nScholastica Academy, Atchison.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of their parents, Nicholas Boos and his sister inherited\r\nthe eighty acre farm upon which they had been reared. Nicholas bought\r\nhis sister’s share of the estate, and by dint of hard, unremitting\r\nlabor, and the exercise of frugality and good financial judgment, has\r\nadded 170 acres to the original tract. There are 205 acres in the home\r\nfarm on the east side of the highway and forty-five acres on the west\r\nside, some distance from his home.\r\n\r\nMr. Boos was married May 1, 1889, to Mary Wolters, born in Atchison\r\ncounty, and daughter of Matthew and Catharine Wolters, both of whom were\r\nnatives of Germany, Matthew being now deceased and his widow residing in\r\nMr. Boos’ home. Ten children have been born to this estimable couple,\r\nnamely: William, aged twenty-five years; Albert, aged twenty-three,\r\nemployed by Dolan Mercantile Company; Nicholas, aged seventeen years;\r\nEdward, twelve years of age; Harold, aged eight years; Hilda, twenty-\r\nthree years of age, and a dressmaker; Marie, aged twenty-one, second\r\nbookkeeper for John J. Intfen, grocer; Frances, aged eighteen,\r\nbookkeeper for Byrnes’ drug store; Bertha, aged fourteen, and Rosa, aged\r\nten years: William, an employee of the Symns Grocer Company, married\r\nMarie McGraff. Mr. and Mrs. Boos have endeavored to give all of their\r\nchildren good school and college educations, and have succeeded in\r\nrearing a fine and worthy family, of which they have a good and just\r\nright to be proud.\r\n\r\nMr. Boos is a member of St. Benedict’s Catholic Church and is a liberal\r\nsupporter of Catholic institutions. He is affiliated with the Modern\r\nWoodmen lodge. While a Democrat in politics, he endeavors to exercise\r\nthe right of suffrage in a manner befitting his own ideas, and supports\r\nsuch candidates for office as come the nearest to his ideal of a good\r\nman and official regardless of political protestations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JUNE E. MOORE.\r\n\r\nJune E. Moore, president of the Symns Grocer Company, of Atchison, Kan.,\r\nis a native of Cincinnati, Ohio, and a son of Thomas H. and Lydia Ann\r\n(Gordon) Moore, the former a native of Virginia, and the latter of New\r\nJersey. The Moore family came to Kansas in 1865, and the father engaged\r\nin the mercantile business at Iowa Point, Doniphan county. He was\r\nengaged in business there about ten years, or until 1876, when he sold\r\nhis business and removed to Kansas City, where he remained until his\r\ndeath, in 1889. His wife died in 1886. June Moore, the subject of this\r\nsketch, received a good common school education, and remained at home,\r\nat Iowa Point, until 1873, when he came to Atchison and accepted a\r\nposition as bookkeeper in the grocery house of A. B. Symns. About three\r\nmonths later he went on the road as traveling salesman for Mr. Symns,\r\nand was the first man to represent Mr. Symns in that capacity. After\r\nremaining in Mr. Symns’ employ for about three years, he went to Falls\r\nCity, Neb., and engaged in the mercantile business for himself, and\r\nconducted a business there for seven years. He then returned to\r\nAtchison, and in 1879 engaged in the grocery business for himself. Mr.\r\nMoore continued in the grocery business in Atchison from 1879 to 1887,\r\nwhen he again became connected with the Symns Grocer Company, which had\r\nbeen reorganized in the meantime. Since that time Mr. Moore has been\r\nconnected with the Symns Grocer Company, which is one of the leading\r\ninstitutions of the kind in the State. From 1889 until 1907 Mr. Moore\r\nhad charge of their Topeka branch. During the year of 1907, M. S.\r\nPeterson, who had been the buyer of the company for a number of years,\r\ndied, and Mr. Moore was obliged to return to Atchison to assume the\r\nresponsibilities in connection with the purchasing department. He looked\r\nafter the purchasing department of the company for one year, when he\r\nbecame president of the company, and has since capably filled that\r\nresponsible position. Mr. Moore is a stockholder in the company, and is\r\none of the men who have contributed many of the best days of their lives\r\nto the upbuilding and development of this great commercial institution,\r\nof which the people of Atchison are justly proud.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore was united in marriage July 27, 1871, to Miss Rebecca\r\nArmstrong, a native of North Carolina. Mrs. Moore was a daughter of\r\nFrancis K. Armstrong, of Virginia, who moved to North Carolina, and\r\nthere married Jerusha Eliza Belt, and returned to Virginia, and in 1859\r\nmigrated to Missouri, remaining in St. Joseph until the fall of 1860,\r\nand then settled on a farm in Doniphan county, Kansas, where he died in\r\nNovember, 1861. Mr. Moore is a member of the Masonic lodge, and one of\r\nthe substantial business men of Atchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             W. PERRY HAM.\r\n\r\nThe powers of leadership are inherent in some individuals, and there are\r\nin every community such men who seem naturally gifted to lead their\r\nfellows in political affairs. In reviewing the life career of W. Perry\r\nHam, the official head of the Republican party in Atchison county, the\r\nfact is brought out that his natural gifts have tended to lead him to\r\nactivity in political affairs, and that he is gifted with ability of a\r\nhigh order, which is universally recognized by the men of his party who\r\nlook to him for leadership. Mr. Ham is a thorough American, whose\r\nancestry goes back to the earliest days of the foundation of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nW. Perry Ham was born October 11, 1861, at Flemingsburg, Fleming county,\r\nKentucky, a son of James P. and Eliza (Jones) Ham, both of whom were\r\nborn and reared in Kentucky, and were children of pioneer parents. James\r\nP. was the son of William and Mary E. Ham, and the great-grandfather of\r\nW. Perry was John Ham, better known as “Jackie,” a native of Greenbrier\r\ncounty, Virginia, who married a Miss Woods, and migrated to Kentucky in\r\nthe days of the illustrious Daniel Boone, the famous hunter. These were\r\ntroublous times in Kentucky, and the Indians fiercely disputed the\r\nadvent of the white settlers into their favorite hunting grounds. The\r\nmother and two sisters of “Jackie” Ham were captured by the Indians,\r\nkilled and scalped, and their bodies burned in the cabin fireplace by\r\nblood-thirsty Indians. The Ham family is of Welsh extraction. James P.\r\nHam, although a southerner by birth and breeding, was a strong Union\r\nman, who was opposed to the institution of slavery. While still residing\r\nin Kentucky, in the year 1865, he received a telegram from his brother.\r\nJoseph, calling him to Buchanan county, Missouri, where his life was in\r\ndanger from Union men. Joseph kept a general store at DeKalb, and was\r\nforced to go in hiding to preserve his life, he being a southern\r\nsympathizer. It was his desire that James P. come to Missouri and take\r\ncharge of his store until times were better, and it was safe for him to\r\nappear. James made all haste to comply with his brother’s request, and\r\nwith his wife and family made a hasty trip to Buchanan county, only to\r\nfind on his arrival that his brother’s store at DeKalb had been burned\r\nto the ground. The wife of James P. was overcome by the excitement, and\r\nher strength overtaxed by the trials of the family, and she died in\r\n1865. This left the father with three children to care for, and he\r\nremoved to Atchison in 1866. Here he engaged in market gardening, and\r\ntook more or less interest in political affairs until his demise,\r\nNovember 2, 1894, at the age of sixty-six years, in Rural township,\r\nJefferson county, Kansas, where he removed a few years after coming to\r\nAtchison.\r\n\r\nW. Perry Ham was reared in Kansas, and attended the common and high\r\nschools of Atchison county. From the time he was six years of age he\r\nfound it necessary to shift for himself, and secured his education\r\nmainly through his own efforts. He did chores and worked for farmers in\r\nreturn for his board and schooling, and generally had a hard time of it\r\ntrying to make his own way in the world. During the famous “grasshopper”\r\nyears the family lived in Jefferson county, and privation and suffering\r\nwere predominant among the settlers. Perry was sent twice each week a\r\ndistance of seven miles, astride his pony, to the nearest relief station\r\nfor food and clothing. His first position was in the old Grant bakery,\r\noperated by Gerber & Hagen, and he was employed there for two years. He\r\nafterwards bought the grocery business at Tenth and Laramie streets, and\r\nwas engaged in business for another period of years until he bought a\r\nfarm near Atchison and moved upon it. He farmed this land for two years,\r\nand in 1895 returned to Atchison, and again entered the grocery\r\nbusiness, at Ninth and Parallel streets. In 1898 he disposed of his\r\nbusiness and accepted a traveling position in the interest of the Select\r\nKnights of the Ancient Order of United Workmen as State manager and\r\norganizer. He continued in this position until 1901, and then opened a\r\nfeed and poultry business, in which undertaking he was engaged until\r\n1909, when he sold out. He served as chief of police of Atchison during\r\n1908 and 1909 under Mayor S. S. King, and has been a member of the city\r\ncouncil for three terms during his residence in Atchison. Since 1909 Mr.\r\nHam has been general organizer of the Fraternal Aid Union, and has made\r\na great success of his work, which requires that he oversee the work of\r\norganizing in the States of Kansas, Oklahoma and Nebraska. His\r\nreputation as an organizer in the interest of the Fraternal Aid Union is\r\nunsurpassed, and it is in this capacity that his remarkable gifts have\r\nreceived full play.\r\n\r\nMr. Ham was married in 1883 to Rosa Frommer, who has borne him children\r\nas follows: Lloyd Perry, clerk in the Atchison postoffice; Mable Rose,\r\nwife of Roy Castle, of Falls City, Neb.; James Harwi Ham, of Atchison;\r\nWalter, of Atchison; Herbert, a jeweler, of Atchison; Myrtle, at home\r\nwith her parents; and Luther, in the city high school. The mother of\r\nthese children was born and reared in Germany, near the city of\r\nStuttgart, and was a daughter of John Frommer, who was a stone-cutter by\r\noccupation. Mrs. Ham came to this country in 1879.\r\n\r\nMr. Ham is a member of the Odd Fellows, the M. B. A., the Knights and\r\nLadies of Security, the Mystic Workers, the Central Protective\r\nAssociation, and the Fraternal Aid Union. In political matters, Mr. Ham\r\nhas been for years a prominent figure in Atchison county and Kansas, and\r\nenjoys a wide and favorable acquaintance among the political leaders of\r\nthe Republican party in Kansas. He has been a member of the central\r\nexecutive committee of his party for several years, and is at present\r\nthe county chairman and virtual leader of his party in Atchison county.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FRANK BEARD.\r\n\r\nFrank Beard, furniture dealer, of Potter, Kan., was born on a farm near\r\nAbingdon, Knox county, Illinois, a son of William M. and Sarah\r\n(Hawthorne) Beard, the former a native of Tennessee and the latter of\r\nMaryland, both of Scotch Presbyterian ancestry. William M., the father,\r\nwas born in Wilson county, Tennessee, on a farm not far from Nashville.\r\nThe grandfather of Frank Beard was Rev. John Beard, born of Virginia\r\nparents, who were among the earliest settlers of Tennessee. The Beards\r\nare a family of pioneers, the pioneering of the family having begun over\r\n100 years ago when the parents of Rev. John Beard crossed the mountains\r\nand made a settlement in western Tennessee, where John Beard was born\r\nDecember 25, 1800. The home of the family was not far from the\r\nbirthplace of Andrew Jackson, with whom John was personally acquainted.\r\nThe family later became pioneers in Illinois, and ever moved westward\r\nuntil they came to Kansas, and were among the first of the sturdy\r\ncharacters to build homes in the new State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Thomas Highfill_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Frank Beard and Family_\r\n]\r\n\r\nRev. John Beard was a minister of the Cumberland Presbyterian\r\ndenomination. He left Tennessee in 1848 and settled in Knox county,\r\nIllinois, and in 1856 came to Kansas, and was one of the first men to\r\npreach the Gospel in Atchison county. He was an ardent Free State man\r\nwho was emphatically opposed to the institution of slavery and\r\nfearlessly attacked the pro-slavery party and its principles from the\r\npulpit. On one occasion he preached a sermon in Mt. Pleasant and laid a\r\nhuge revolver on the pulpit beside his Bible with the remark, “I hope\r\nthere will be peace during the services,” and there was peace. This\r\naction was in keeping with the fearless character of the man himself.\r\nRev. John Beard died at the age of sixty-six years. No pictorial\r\nlikeness of this famous pioneer is available or his grandson, Frank,\r\nwould have it inserted in the history. His last sermon was preached at\r\nPleasant Grove church in South Atchison. During his career he served the\r\nRound Prairie and High Prairie churches in Leavenworth county, the Wolf\r\nCreek congregation in Brown county, and the Pleasant Grove church in\r\nAtchison county. He was traveling at all times, to and fro, in northeast\r\nKansas while engaged in the Lord’s work. His son, William M., left\r\nIllinois in 1862 and settled in Brown county, Kansas, and in 1865 came\r\nto Atchison county. Border ruffians at one time raided the home of\r\nWilliam Beard in Brown county. Mattie Beard, a three months’ old babe,\r\nwas awakened by the noise made by the raiders and screamed loudly. One\r\nof the ruffians walked to the cradle, drew his revolver and said: “I’ll\r\nstop her noise.” The mother made frantic by this threat picked up a\r\nchair, and with all her strength, augmented by her fright, rushed at the\r\nraider and knocked him down. After this occurrence the Beards left\r\nKansas and returned to Illinois, where people were more of one mind on\r\nthe subject of slavery and life was much safer. They remained in\r\nIllinois until the close of the war and then came again to Atchison\r\ncounty, settling on a farm in Walnut township. This farm has been owned\r\nby the Beard family for fifty years and is now in possession of John\r\nBeard, a son of William. Rev. John Beard died in Atchison county in\r\nAugust, 1866. William M. died in 1905, and his faithful wife followed\r\nhim to the great beyond two years later, in 1907. The father of Sarah\r\nHawthorne Beard was also a pioneer settler of Knox county, Illinois, and\r\nplanted the first apple orchard in that section of the State, and was\r\nthe first and only apple exhibitor at the first county fair ever held in\r\nKnox county, Illinois.\r\n\r\nFrank Beard was a boy of seven when his parents removed to Atchison\r\ncounty and was reared on the farm in Walnut township, receiving his\r\nschooling in district No. 60. He followed farming until 1909, when he\r\ncame to Potter and engaged in the general merchandise business in\r\npartnership with Mr. Hodges. This partnership continued until 1911, when\r\nhe sold out his interest in the general store, and in July of that year\r\npurchased the furniture and undertaking business which he is now\r\nconducting successfully.\r\n\r\nMr. Beard was married in 1898 to Miss Bee Henson, a daughter of A. T.\r\nand Amanda (Cox) Henson, the former a native of Kentucky and the latter\r\nhaving been born in Missouri. The Hensons migrated to Kansas in 1854\r\nbefore the organization of the State and settled in Jefferson county.\r\nThey were Free State advocates and took part in the struggle which made\r\nKansas a Free State. Mr. and Mrs. Beard have one child, Leona Beard,\r\nborn in 1903.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party has always claimed the allegiance of Mr. Beard in\r\nNational affairs, but he is inclined to independence of voting in local,\r\ncounty and State affairs. He is a member of Kickapoo Lodge, No. 4,\r\nAncient Free and Accepted Masons, the Modern Woodmen of America, the\r\nModern Brotherhood, and the Knights and Ladies of Security. Mr. Beard is\r\none of Potter’s best and well respected citizens, a successful and\r\nprosperous business man who is ever willing to put his shoulder to the\r\nwheel to advance the interests of his home community.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THOMAS HIGHFILL.\r\n\r\nThe late Thomas Highfill, of Easton township, Leavenworth county,\r\nKansas, was born April 9, 1844, on a farm near the city of Madison, in\r\nsoutheastern Indiana. He was a son of William Highfill, who was born in\r\nSouth Carolina of German parents, and was there reared to young manhood,\r\nwent to Kentucky from South Carolina, and there met and married\r\nElizabeth Bonnell, born in Kentucky of German ancestry. Shortly after\r\ntheir marriage William Highfill and his wife crossed the Ohio river and\r\nsettled near Madison on the Flat Rock river. He had charge of the toll-\r\ngate entrance of the bridge crossing the Flat Rock at that time. When\r\nThomas was four years of age, or in 1849, the father and his family\r\nloaded their movable effects on wagons and started across the plains, en\r\nroute to California, consuming six months on the long trip, their wagons\r\nbeing hauled by slow-moving oxen. The family remained in California for\r\nfour years, and William spent the time profitably in placer mining for\r\nthe yellow metal, after which they returned to the middle West, this\r\ntime making the return trip with horses instead of oxen. They settled in\r\nPlatte county, Missouri, and resided there until 1862, when William\r\nHighfill made a final settlement in Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison\r\ncounty. He died the same year in Atchison county. George Highfill, son\r\nof Thomas, is now the owner of the original home place of the Highfill\r\nfamily in Atchison county.\r\n\r\nThomas Highfill was eighteen years of age when his father came to\r\nAtchison county. He assisted in the operation of the home farm until his\r\nmarriage, November 24, 1864, to Elvira Porter, who was born in Casey\r\ncounty, Kentucky, February 7, 1847, a daughter of George and Sarah Ann\r\n(Foster) Porter, both of whom were born in Kentucky, and resided in\r\ntheir native State until November, 1850, when they removed to Buchanan\r\ncounty, Missouri, and there farmed for two years on the McDonald farm,\r\nnear Wallace. The Porters came to Atchison county, Kansas, among the\r\nearliest of the pioneers in the spring of 1855 and settled on a tract of\r\nland just one-half mile west of the present town of Potter. George\r\nPorter filed on 160 acres of land in the fall of 1854 which has never\r\nchanged ownership but once and has never been out of the family, being\r\nnow owned by George Highfill, the eldest grandson of George Porter. The\r\nelder Porter, although born and bred in a slave State, abhorred the\r\ninstitution of slavery, despite the fact that his father, Isaac Porter,\r\nwas a slave owner. He saw the evils of slavery when a youth and\r\ndetermined never to support it, because it was utterly wrong. He came to\r\nKansas imbued with the determination to do his part in making the State\r\nfree. He suffered considerably from the forays of the border ruffians\r\nand his homestead on the banks of the Big Stranger was raided frequently\r\nby the pro-slavery element. At one time Mr. Porter had a fine saddle\r\nhorse stolen from him by border ruffians. As soon as he learned of the\r\ntheft he set out after the thieves armed only with a bowie knife stuck\r\nin his boot top. He followed them to Atchison and lay hid in a clump of\r\njimson weeds, near the camp of the ruffians on the spot where the Santa\r\nFe railroad yards are now located. The marauders were drinking and\r\ncarousing in seeming safety and had no idea that they would be followed.\r\nAs a consequence of their neglect in not placing a sentry Mr. Porter was\r\nenabled to secure his horse and return home in safety at 4 o’clock in\r\nthe morning. At the outbreak of the Civil war Mr. Porter enlisted in the\r\nThirteenth Kansas regiment and served throughout the war. While absent\r\nin defense of the Union his wife and five children were left to shift\r\nfor themselves as best they could. George Porter was a stanch Republican\r\nin his political affiliations and was a member of the Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic. He died February 19, 1887, the age of sixty-five years, having\r\nbeen born January 21, 1822. His wife, Sarah Ann, died June 23, 1897.\r\nThey were the parents of eight children, of whom Mrs. Thomas Highfill\r\nwas the eldest. Mrs. Highfill was ten years old when the Porter family\r\nlocated in Kansas, and during the days of the Civil war, when the\r\nbreadwinner of the family was absent fighting for the Union, this brave\r\nwoman ploughed with an ox team and did the hardest kind of farm labor.\r\n\r\nTo Thomas Highfill and wife were born the following children: George,\r\nborn September 8, 1865, and is the owner of the farm preëmpted by his\r\ngrandfather Porter; John, born December 12, 1866; Sarah Elizabeth, wife\r\nof P. H. Fleer, of Potter, Kan., was born June 23, 1868, and died May\r\n11, 1909; Thomas J., born April 8, 1870, residing in Potter; Mrs. Rose,\r\nwife of Clarence Binkley, of Atchison, born December 23, 1878; Abigail,\r\nwife of Ashton Hundley, of Atchison county, born October 19, 1879;\r\nMartina, wife of Louis Linville, of Spring Lake, Texas, born November\r\n14, 1880; and Benjamin F., born June 10, 1884. The mother of these\r\nchildren resides on the Highfill place, west of Potter. Her son, George,\r\nis a prosperous farmer and good business man, who is connected with the\r\nFarmers State Bank of Potter.\r\n\r\nThomas Highfill departed this life March 7, 1899. He was a well\r\nrespected and industrious citizen who did well his part in the\r\ndevelopment of Atchison county.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN H. BEAN.\r\n\r\nJohn H. Bean, having been a resident of Atchison county for a period of\r\nnearly sixty years, is naturally considered as one of the pioneers of\r\nthe county. He has lived in the county since the year 1857, when his\r\nfather, Michael Bean, filed on a Government homestead in Mt. Pleasant\r\ntownship, seven miles southwest of Atchison. John was born on a farm in\r\nIllinois October 22, 1850. His parents were Michael, born in Winchester,\r\nKy., and son of William Bean, a native of Virginia, and Rebecca\r\nNorthcutt, wife of Michael, who was born and reared near Winchester,\r\nIll. Michael Bean came to Atchison February 5, 1853, filed on a claim,\r\nas stated above, and developed it into a splendid farm. On account of\r\nborder troubles he returned to Independence, Mo., and remained for four\r\nyears, and then returned to his claim. Michael died December 9, 1893,\r\nwhen a little over sixty-five years of age. He was a soldier in the\r\nUnion army, having enlisted in Company F of the Thirteenth Kansas\r\nregiment in 1862 and served until the close of the war. He was mustered\r\nout at Ft. Leavenworth, after taking an active part in military\r\noperations in southeast Missouri, Ft. Smith and Little Rock, Ark. To\r\nMichael and Rebecca Bean were born seven children, namely: John H.; Mrs.\r\nMary Barber, deceased; William, in Colorado; Paul, deceased; Mrs. Minnie\r\nLedger, of Kansas City; Mrs. Ida Mayfield, living on the old homestead\r\nin Mt. Pleasant township; Alvin, farmer, living in Shannon township;\r\nBarbara died in infancy; Mrs. Barbara Helen Hayes, of Lincoln, Neb. The\r\nmother of these children died in 1903, at the age of seventy-five years.\r\n\r\nWhen John H. Bean was twenty-three years of age he left home and went to\r\nColorado, where he spent the intervening years until 1893 in the gold\r\nand silver mines of the State with intermittent fortunes attending his\r\nefforts. After two years’ residence in St. Joseph, Mo., he spent four\r\nyears engaged in lumbering in the woods of northern Michigan. He then\r\nreturned to Atchison, and after two years on the Atchison police force,\r\nand for four years, from 1909 to 1913, inclusive, he was cell-keeper in\r\nthe State reformatory at Hutchinson, Kan. He returned to Atchison and\r\nwas attached to the Atchison police department as one of its most\r\nefficient and faithful members until October 1, 1915, when he became\r\ngate-tender for the Atchison Bridge Company. He has been twice married,\r\nhis first wife being Florence Bridges, who bore him one child, Mrs.\r\nArmina Bolen, of Leon, Kan. His second wife was Ella Mitchell, who died\r\nin Michigan in 1898.\r\n\r\nMr. Bean has always been a Republican in politics, but has never been a\r\ncandidate for any political office. In this respect he follows in the\r\nfootsteps of his father, Michael, who was an active politician in his\r\nday, although he never sought official preferment. Michael Bean was\r\nconsidered as one of the really influential men of Atchison county in\r\npolitical affairs and was a great and stanch friend of Senator John J.\r\nIngalls, besides having a wide and favorable acquaintance with the\r\npeople of the county. He counted among his friends many of the famous\r\nmen of Atchison and the State. For thirteen years he was in charge of\r\nthe county poor farm, and during that time he made a record since\r\nunsurpassed for management of the farm. Michael was a large man,\r\nphysically, of the true pioneer type—one of those outspoken, honest\r\nfellows, who said outright what he thought, and was a friend to all who\r\nknew him and trusted him. It is said that no needy settler went to\r\nMichael Bean for assistance when in dire need and came away empty-\r\nhanded. If a settler needed money to buy a cow or horse, it was\r\nforthcoming without the usual security or note which accompanies latter-\r\nday transactions of this character. Liberal in his views, he was liberal\r\nwith his means and was always ready and willing to help an acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ANDREW SPEER.\r\n\r\nAndrew Speer, county commissioner for the second district of Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, was born in this county, February 20, 1863. He was a son\r\nof Joseph and Mary (Fountain) Speer, both of whom were natives of\r\nLawrence county, Indiana. In 1859 Joseph and his wife left the old home\r\nin Indiana, en route to Kansas, and stopped during the winter in Iowa,\r\nwhere the oldest child of the family was born. Joseph came on to Kansas,\r\nleaving his wife in Iowa among friends, and preëmpted a quarter section\r\nof land in Grasshopper township, three miles northeast of Muscotah, now\r\nowned by William Speer. In the spring of 1860, the year of the great\r\ndrought, the father of the family returned to Iowa and brought his wife\r\nand son, William, to the new home which he had prepared for them on the\r\nKansas plains. While the drought of their first year in Kansas worked\r\nconsiderable hardship upon the settlers, Joseph was better prepared to\r\nwithstand this hardship, because of the fact that he had brought\r\nconsiderable means with him, which enabled him to successfully weather\r\nthe crop failure of that year. Joseph Speer was a man of more than\r\nordinary education and had been a school teacher in Indiana in his\r\nyounger days. All of his life, he was a student and was a fine\r\nmathematician. While teaching in Indiana he had read law to some extent,\r\nand became a justice of the peace in Grasshopper township, a position\r\nwhich he held for many years. He also served several years as township\r\ntrustee. Nine children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Speer, of whom\r\nAndrew is the third in order of birth. (See biography of D. Anna Speer,\r\ncounty superintendent of schools, for further details regarding the\r\nSpeer family.)\r\n\r\nAndrew Speer, with whom this review is directly concerned, was educated\r\nin the district school of his neighborhood, and brought up on his\r\nfather’s farm. His marriage occurred after a trip to the western part of\r\nKansas in 1888, and he then rented a farm. He has continually been\r\nengaged in farming and is now cultivating the Moore farm of 320 acres in\r\nGrasshopper township. When the Cherokee strip was thrown open to\r\nsettlement in the Indian Territory by the Government in 1892 Mr. Speer,\r\nwith eleven other Kansans from his neighborhood, made the run for\r\nhomesteads on the opening day. Six thousand or more men were lined up\r\nready for the great race and all rushed forward when the cannon boomed\r\nfor the start. Andrew drove a wagon and was unfortunate in staking out\r\nhis claim which proved to be a quarter section of school land. Each of\r\nthe other eleven men who accompanied him secured a good claim.\r\n\r\nMr. Speer was married May 1, 1889, to Miss Alida Gilliland, who has\r\nborne him five children, namely: Myrtle, wife of Fred Draper, a farmer\r\nof Atchison county; Albert, at home; Joseph, a teacher at Prospect Hill,\r\nAtchison county, and the first school teacher ever graduated from the\r\nMuscotah schools and directly became a teacher; Stephen, a pupil of the\r\neighth grade of the Muscotah schools, and Nicholas, deceased. The mother\r\nof these children was born in Illinois, October 22, 1863, a daughter of\r\nJosiah and Delitha (Maxwell) Gilliland, who died when she was but a\r\nchild four years of age. She then went to the home of an aunt, Mrs.\r\nKline, living in Jackson county, Kansas, who reared her to young\r\nwomanhood. Josiah Gilliland lives in Nebraska, aged eighty-three years.\r\nHe was a veteran of the Civil war from Illinois, and served in the Union\r\narmy, and moved to Missouri directly after the war ended.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party has always had the unswerving allegiance and\r\nsupport of Mr. Speer, and he stands high in the councils of his party in\r\nAtchison county. He was first elected to the office of township trustee\r\nand served for four years. Two years after his term of office as trustee\r\nexpired he was elected to the office of county commissioner of the\r\nsecond district. Mr. Speer has performed the duties of his official\r\nposition with great credit to himself and for the benefit of his\r\nconstituents. He is an honest and capable county official who has the\r\nbest interests of the entire county at heart. He is a member of the\r\nMasonic lodge of Muscotah, the Modern Woodmen of America, and the\r\nCentral Protective Association. Mrs. Speer is a member of the Methodist\r\nchurch, the Eastern Star lodge, the Royal Neighbors and the Mystic\r\nWorkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SAMUEL EDWARD FIECHTER.\r\n\r\nSamuel Edward Fiechter, now living retired on his beautiful suburban\r\nplace near Atchison, which is located on the west side of Forest Park,\r\nis a native of Missouri. He was born in Andrew county August 25, 1856,\r\nand is a son of John George and Anna (Bright) Fiechter. The father was\r\nborn in Baden, Germany, January 27, 1815, and died in Brown county,\r\nKansas, December 20, 1893. Anna Bright, his wife, was born in Berne,\r\nSwitzerland, October 26, 1822, and died in Brown county, Kansas, August\r\n8, 1900. George Fiechter immigrated to America with his parents about\r\n1835. They located in Missouri, and George engaged in farming in Andrew\r\ncounty, that State. In 1860 he traded his Missouri farm for a farm in\r\nBrown county, Kansas, where he was successfully engaged in farming until\r\nhe retired. He accumulated considerable property, and at the time of his\r\ndeath owned something over 400 acres. To John George and Anna (Bright)\r\nFiechter were born the following children: John resides in Brown county;\r\nFred, deceased; Louise, deceased; George, deceased; Susan married S. E.\r\nRush, and resides in South Dakota; Samuel E., the subject of this\r\nsketch; Jacob, deceased; Tina married Oscar Dean, and resides in Chase\r\ncounty, Kansas.\r\n\r\nSamuel Edward Fiechter was reared on the farm, and received a good\r\ncommon school education. At the age of twenty-one he engaged in farming\r\nfor himself, and later rented his father’s farm, and cared for his\r\nparents during their lives. He followed farming in Brown county until\r\n1902, when he removed to Atchison, and after residing in the city for\r\neight months purchased his present place. His farm is one of the best\r\nimproved places in Brown county, consisting of 360 acres of land, under\r\na high state of cultivation.\r\n\r\nMr. Fiechter was married November 20, 1884, to Miss Sarah Parker. She\r\nwas born in Andrew county, Missouri, July 17, 1863, and is a daughter of\r\nWilliam and Rachel (Esslinger) Parker, the former a native of Indiana,\r\nborn March 12, 1835, and the latter was born in Andrew county, Missouri,\r\nSeptember 20, 1842. William Parker came to Missouri with his parents,\r\nDaniel and Sarah (Davis) Parker, when he was a child. The parents were\r\nnatives of Kentucky, and after coming to Missouri, spent the remainder\r\nof their lives in that State. Mrs. Fiechter was the oldest of a family\r\nof six children; the others in order of birth are as follows: Frank\r\nresides in Colorado Springs, Colo.; Jennie resides with her parents;\r\nDaniel, Boise, Idaho; Mrs. Mae Zimmerman, Boise, Idaho; and Stella Allen\r\ndied September 16, 1915, at Cosby, Mo. To Mr. and Mrs. Fiechter has been\r\nborn one child, Edna, who married Ray McGaughey, and resides on a farm\r\nin Brown county. Mr. Fiechter is a member of the Modern Woodmen of\r\nAmerica, and is a Republican. The family are members of the Lutheran\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MRS. JENNIE CIRTWILL.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jennie Cirtwill, of Lancaster, Kan., is the widow of Richard N.\r\nCirtwill, one of the well known and substantial farmers of Atchison\r\ncounty, who was among the early settlers of this county. Richard N.\r\nCirtwill was born in Jefferson county, New York, September 20, 1828. He\r\nwas reared to young manhood in New York, and at the outbreak of the\r\nCivil war offered his services in defense of the Union. Mr. Cirtwill\r\nenlisted August 24, 1864, in Company I, One Hundred and Eighty-sixth\r\nregiment of New York infantry, and served until his honorable discharge,\r\nJune 2, 1865. He was color bearer of his regiment, and fought at the\r\nbattle of Petersburg and at the siege and capture of Richmond. Mr.\r\nCirtwill carried the regimental colors at Petersburg and during this\r\nfierce engagement his clothing and flag were riddled with bullets, and\r\nhe received a slight wound in his side. His son, Albert D., was also a\r\nmember of the same company and regiment, as his father and was wounded\r\nat the battle of Petersburg. Mr. Cirtwill was first married in New York\r\nState to Susan Burns, who departed this life in 1885.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Jennie Cirtwill_\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Cirtwill came to Kansas in 1871 and developed a fine farm and became\r\nwell-to-do.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1889, Mr. Cirtwill married Mrs. Jennie (McClain) Cameron,\r\nwhose first husband was James Cameron, a native of Carrickfergus,\r\nIreland, born in 1848. When a young man, James Cameron became a sailor,\r\nand was first mate on a vessel sailing the Atlantic ocean. At the\r\noutbreak of the Civil war, Mr. Cameron enlisted in the Union army at\r\nBangor, Me., and served until the close of the war. In 1869 he came to\r\nMuscotah, Kan., and worked as a contractor and brick mason. Six children\r\nwere born of this marriage: Frank, deceased; William, a traveling\r\nsalesman, Kansas City, Mo.; John R., a railway operator, of Mountain\r\nHome, Idaho; Rose died in infancy; Frank J., a railroad conductor, St.\r\nJoseph, Mo., and Walter H., a traveling salesman, Kansas City, Mo. The\r\nfather of these children died in 1903.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jennie Cirtwill was born at the Bank Cottages, Scotland, May 1,\r\n1849, a daughter of William and Rosanna (Saul) McClain, who emigrated\r\nfrom their native heath in 1855, and first settled in Illinois, where\r\nthe father became a contractor and builder in the employ of the Illinois\r\nCentral Railroad Company. He, too, became a soldier, thus making a\r\nremarkable coincident, wherein Mrs. Cirtwill was the daughter of a\r\nsoldier, and both of her former husbands were Union veterans. Mr.\r\nMcClain served with bravery in an Illinois regiment of volunteers. In\r\n1870 he came to Atchison county and engaged in the lumber and building\r\nbusiness at Muscotah, Kan. He became the owner of several farms and was\r\nwell-to-do at the time of his death, February 13, 1907. The mother of\r\nMrs. Cirtwill died in 1915, at the ripe old age of ninety-three years.\r\nBoth parents are buried at Lancaster, Kan. A bright spot in the memories\r\nof Mrs. Cirtwill is the fact that she was permitted to care for her aged\r\nparents in their declining years and made a home and furnished every\r\ncomfort for them.\r\n\r\nWhen residing in Muscotah, Mrs. Cirtwill, nee Cameron, was left almost\r\ndestitute with the care of her five children on her hands. She was\r\nforced to do the hardest kind of work to keep them in comfort and send\r\nthem to school. She worked as a tailor and seamstress in order to do\r\nthis, and long and exacting hours of toil were necessary to hold the\r\nlittle family together, but later, better days came and she has had the\r\nextreme satisfaction of seeing her children, for whom she made\r\nsacrifices in those earlier days, become substantial and well-to-do\r\ncitizens of their respective localities.\r\n\r\nA brother of Mrs. Cirtwill, John McClain, was killed by a horse when\r\nfour years of age. William, the only brother reared to manhood, was a\r\nbanker at Huron, Kan., but sold his interests there and removed to Peru,\r\nKan., where he started a bank of his own. Three years later he went to\r\nCoffeyville, Kan., and lived there for a short time. Very early he began\r\nto see the future value of oil lands in Oklahoma, and invested heavily\r\nin Oklahoma land which proved to be a very profitable investment.\r\nBesides being a capitalist and builder he was a speaker and public man,\r\nwell known in Atchison county and Kansas. He died in Coffeyville, Kan.,\r\nJanuary 5, 1911, at the age of fifty years. He left a widow and one\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nThe mother of Mrs. Cirtwill, who was Mrs. Rosanna (Saul) McClain, was a\r\nskilled seamstress, and had the honor of attending the coronation\r\nceremonies of Queen Victoria in England. Her father was Thomas Saul, a\r\npoet of unusual ability, endowed with a wonderful memory and an ability\r\nto quote poetry and the classics which his daughter inherited to a great\r\nextent. Through her great-grandmother, Rosanna Saul McClain was of royal\r\nlineage, having been born in a royal golden bed of honor, only\r\nvouchsafed to those of kingly lineage. This great-grandmother became\r\nvery wealthy and left a large estate to her two daughters. Rosanna and\r\nher sister were highly skilled in tailoring and needle work and\r\nembroidery, and were highly rewarded by Queen Victoria for making and\r\nembroidering a beautiful dress for the queen to wear on state occasions.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cirtwill is the owner of considerable property in Atchison county,\r\nincluding 260 acres of fine land, a store building and a home in\r\nLancaster, Kan. She has two grandchildren: Cecil Mae, and Jeanette Rose\r\nCameron, children of Frank J. Cameron. Besides her Atchison county\r\nproperty this well-to-do Atchison county woman has several vacant lots\r\nand residence properties in St. Joseph, Mo., and is considered to be an\r\nable business woman. She is a member of the Rebekah lodge, of Lancaster,\r\nand is a prominent member of the Methodist Episcopal church. For many\r\nyears she has taught a Sunday school class, of which she is very fond.\r\nMrs. Cirtwill usually spends the summer seasons in traveling and during\r\nthe summer and fall of 1915, she spent several weeks in the West,\r\nprincipally in Denver and vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ASA BARNES.\r\n\r\nThe name of Barnes figures prominently in the early history of Kansas\r\nand Atchison county, and the history of the family in Kansas dates from\r\nthe spring of 1858 when Capt. Asa Barnes came from the ancestral home of\r\nthe Barnes family in New Jersey, and settled in Mt. Pleasant township,\r\nAtchison county, and immediately identified himself with the Free State\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAsa Barnes, the present representative of the family living on the old\r\nBarnes homestead in Mt. Pleasant township, five miles northwest of\r\nPotter, was born in January, 1854, in New Brunswick, N. J., a son of Asa\r\nand Harriet (Cook) Barnes, the former a native of Connecticut and the\r\nlatter of New Jersey of English descent. Asa Barnes, the father of the\r\nsubject, was born in 1821, and became a papermaker in New Brunswick,\r\nwhere several of his children were born. In 1858 he disposed of his\r\nbelongings and property in New Jersey and migrated to Kansas, settling\r\nin Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison county. His wife and children\r\nfollowed him in April, 1859. When he first came to Kansas he was a\r\nDemocrat in politics, but changed his political belief soon afterward\r\nand espoused the cause of the Free State party. He took a prominent and\r\nactive part in political affairs and became well known throughout the\r\nState as an able and influential champion of freedom. On two different\r\noccasions he was elected to represent Atchison county in the State\r\nlegislature and served the people with distinction and ability. When the\r\nCivil war broke out between the States he organized Company A of the\r\nTwelfth Kansas cavalry and served as captain of the company; he also\r\nhelped to organize a company for the Thirteenth Kansas infantry. He was\r\nfurther distinguished by his war service in a manner which reflected\r\ncredit upon himself and his home county. Captain Barnes died January 12,\r\n1889. Asa Barnes was the father of ten sons and one daughter, as\r\nfollows: R. A., deceased; M. N., deceased; Enoch, deceased; Asa, Jr.,\r\nFillmore died in New Jersey; Frank, living in California; Laura\r\n(Willis), Corning, Kan.; Louis, living at Binger, Okla.; Harry, Bisbee,\r\nAriz.; Orrin, of Nevada; Reuben C., deceased. The mother of these\r\nchildren died February 12, 1909, at the age of eighty-two years.\r\n\r\nAsa Barnes, the younger, was one of three sons of Capt. Asa Barnes, and\r\ngrew to manhood on his father’s farm in Atchison county. He remained at\r\nhome and assisted his father in the management of the home farm until he\r\nattained his majority. After his marriage in 1874 he rented land on his\r\nown account for six years and then bought the home farm of 207 acres\r\nfrom his father and the heirs, part of which is now owned by his sons.\r\nHe has followed a plan of general farming and has prospered to a\r\nconsiderable extent. Mr. Barnes was married November 5, 1874, to Miss\r\nKate Thompson, of Atchison county. This marriage has been blessed with\r\nfive children, as follows: Fannie, deceased; Herbert, at home with his\r\nparents; Bertha, wife of A. J. Pease, of Atchison; Leola, wife of A. J.\r\nSaggs, of Falls City, Nebraska; Ernest L., at home; Dora, wife of Ed\r\nLee, of Atchison county; Cora, deceased. The mother of these children\r\nwas born October 2, 1854, and is a daughter of Hon. George W. Thompson,\r\nnow living in Atchison, and who is probably the oldest living pioneer\r\nsettler of Atchison county, and concerning whose career an extended\r\nreview is given in this volume.\r\n\r\nIn political affairs Mr. Barnes, while favoring the Progressive party\r\nprinciples, is inclined to be independent in his voting. He is a member\r\nof the Christian church, and is well and favorably known throughout this\r\nsection of Atchison county, being rated as a substantial well-to-do\r\nfarmer, who is deserving of considerable credit for what he has\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CHARLES ARTHUR CHANDLER.\r\n\r\nCharles Arthur Chandler is one of the self-made men of Atchison. Some\r\nmen are successful because of a fortunate chain of circumstances\r\nattending their efforts which we commonly refer to as “good luck”;\r\nothers by dint of steady employment, saving their surplus funds and\r\ninvesting them wisely, are enabled to secure the necessary wherewithal\r\nto embark in business and attain a substantial modicum of wealth. It is\r\nto the latter class that Mr. Chandler properly belongs. While good\r\nfortune has generally attended his industry and plans, his success is\r\ndue to the husbanding of his resources, and planning ahead with the\r\ncoöperation of a faithful wife, so that he could eventually be his own\r\nemployer and engage in mercantile pursuits for himself. Since January 1,\r\n1910, he has been engaged in the lumber business in connection with the\r\nShulz-Fisk Lumber Company, one of the oldest concerns in the city. Four\r\nmen are employed to take care of the extensive business which comes to\r\nthe yards. Lumber, lime, cement, plaster and building material of all\r\nkinds are sold in large quantities. The extensive yards, 100×250 feet,\r\nare rated as among the best equipped and most modern in northeastern\r\nKansas, and the management is constantly improving the appearance and\r\nfacilities of the buildings.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was born November 22, 1860, in Fond du Lac, Wis., a son of\r\nCharles and Maria (Moore) Chandler, natives of Munson, Mass., and\r\nMontreal, Canada, respectively. The Chandler family is a very old one in\r\nAmerica, and an extensive genealogy of the family has been compiled.\r\nWilliam Chandler, progenitor of the family in this country, emigrated\r\nfrom the ancestral home in England to Roxbury, Mass., in 1637, dying\r\nthere November 26, 1641. He had a son named John, born 1635, who married\r\nElizabeth Douglas, of Roxbury, Mass. Succeeding generations are as\r\nfollows, in a direct line to C. A. Chandler: Captain Joseph Chandler,\r\nborn June 4, 1683, wife, Susannah Perrin, of Roxbury, Mass.; David\r\nChandler, born May 28, 1712, wife, Mary Allen, of Pomfret, Conn.; Elijah\r\nChandler, born May 3, 1737, wife, Sarah Frizzel, of Woodstock, Conn.;\r\nCharles Chandler, born June 23, 1779, wife, Margaret Edgerton, of\r\nMunson, Mass.; Charles Chandler, born February 21, 1822, wife, Maria\r\nMoore Shepard; C. A. Chandler, born November 22, 1860, wife, Effie Rook,\r\nof Atchison, Kan.; Elijah Chandler was a soldier in the French and\r\nIndian war. Charles Chandler, father of the subject of this review, was\r\na “Forty-Niner,” who made the long trip to California across the plains\r\nin 1849. He mined gold in the placer fields of the Golden State for some\r\ntime, and then returned to the East, via the Nicaragua route, settling\r\ndown in Fond du Lac, Wis., where he engaged in the grain business with\r\nfair success. He died at his home in Fond du Lac in 1896, at the age of\r\nseventy-five years. He was the father of three children: Mrs. Charles E.\r\nRogers, Fond du Lac; Fred Shepard, also of Fond du Lac, and Charles A.,\r\nwith whom this review is directly concerned. The mother of these\r\nchildren, Maria Moore Shepard, was born in 1826, and is a direct\r\ndescendant of Governor William Bradford, of Massachusetts. The\r\ngenealogical tree in a direct line from the colonial governor is as\r\nfollows: Gov. William Bradford; his son, Maj. William Bradford; Alice\r\nBradford married Maj. James Fitch, 1649–1727; Daniel Fitch, 1693–1752,\r\nwife, Anna Cook; William Fitch, 1720—, wife, Mary Paine; Abigail Fitch,\r\n1745–1785, married Joseph Moore, 1745–1823; Anna Moore, 1770–1854,\r\nmarried Timothy Shepard, 1764–1817; Maria Moore Shepard, 1826, etc.\r\n\r\nC. A. Chandler was educated in the public schools of his native city and\r\nfitted himself for the profession of civil engineer by a considerable\r\namount of home study and practical experience. After getting launched in\r\nhis chosen profession, he entered the employ of the Missouri Pacific\r\nrailroad and remained in the employ of this railroad for a period of\r\ntwenty-five years. He first came to Atchison in May, 1885, and has since\r\nbeen a resident here.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler is the owner of the Graham farm of 310 acres near Cummings,\r\nAtchison county, Kansas. Every dollar’s worth of property which he owns\r\nhas been accumulated by his own endeavors; not one dollar was ever\r\nreceived by him through inheritance or gift, and he and his wife have\r\nthe great satisfaction of knowing that what they have and own is theirs\r\nby right of industry and thrift. Mr. Chandler is a Republican, a member\r\nof the Episcopal church, and is fraternally associated with the Masonic\r\norder, a member of Active Lodge, No. 158, Ancient Free and Accepted\r\nMasons, and the Ancient Order of United Workmen. He was married February\r\n4, 1891, to Effie Rook, of Atchison. To this union have been born:\r\nHorace F., born September 19, 1896, a graduate of the Atchison High\r\nSchool, class of 1913, and now a sophomore in Kansas University,\r\nLawrence; Esther, born March 5, 1898, senior student in the Atchison\r\nHigh School, class of 1916. The mother of these children is a daughter\r\nof Judge Horace M. Jackson, a biography of whom is published in this\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GRACE CROSBY POWER.\r\n\r\nThe city of Atchison is fortunate in having as the present\r\nsuperintendent of the city hospital a lady of talent and ability, which,\r\ncombined with great personal charm, constitute a splendid equipment for\r\nthe important position which Miss Power holds. She is eminently\r\nqualified by training and executive capacity to perform the exacting\r\nduties required of a hospital superintendent, and she is fast becoming\r\ndeservedly popular among the people of Atchison, who support this justly\r\nfamous institution.\r\n\r\nGrace Crosby Power is a native of Indiana, born October 23, 1880, in the\r\ntown of Milroy, Rush county, and is a daughter of William Strange and\r\nMary E. (Crosby) Power. Her father was also a native of Rush county,\r\nIndiana, born in 1837, a son of an Indiana pioneer family. His parents\r\nwere John A. and Mary A. (Smisor) Power, both of whom were natives of\r\nGermany and Scotland, respectively. They immigrated to America from\r\nGermany in an early day, and cleared a farm from the dense wilderness of\r\nRush county by dint of hard labor and the exercise of fortitude. This\r\nGerman-American couple had the satisfaction of gaining a substantial\r\ncompetence from the soil and of bequeathing a good family of sons and\r\ndaughters to their adopted land. William Power was one of the first fine\r\nlive stock breeders of Rush county, and his farm became famous for the\r\nHambletonian horses which it produced. He died in 1906 in his home town,\r\nMilroy. His wife, Mary, was born in Milroy, Ind., in 1837, a daughter of\r\nMichael and Lucinda Crosby, natives of Ireland, and also early settlers\r\nof Rush county, Indiana. The Powers were all members of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal church, and have been prominent in the affairs of Rush county\r\nfor many years. William Power was one of the well-to-do men of the\r\ncounty. To Mr. and Mrs. William Power were born four children: Cora\r\nEstelle, wife of Prof. E. F. Engel, of Lawrence, Kan.; Kathrine, wife of\r\nRev. W. F. Smith, of the Methodist church, at Huntington, Ind.; Frank\r\nA., Wichita, Kan., a director of the Power-Myers music house; Miss Grace\r\nCrosby Power, with whom this review is directly concerned.\r\n\r\nMiss Power received her elementary education in the public schools of\r\nMilroy, Ind., and afterwards entered DePauw University, at Greencastle,\r\nInd., where she pursued a music course for two years. She then came to\r\nKansas and studied in the liberal arts department of Kansas University,\r\nat Lawrence. While her original intention had been to perfect herself in\r\nart and music, she became imbued with the idea of becoming a nurse,\r\nfeeling that a wider field was offered in the art of caring for the\r\nsick, and that she could be of greater service to humanity. Accordingly,\r\nMiss Power entered the University Medical Hospital of Kansas City, Mo.,\r\nin 1905, and began the studies which were to prepare her for her life\r\nwork as a hospital nurse. She applied herself diligently to her medical\r\nstudies and was graduated from the Kansas City institution in 1908. She\r\nwas then offered the position of superintendent of the Galesburg, Ill.,\r\nhospital, and accepted, remaining there until 1911. She was not yet\r\nsatisfied with her professional preparation, and resigning her position,\r\nshe spent one year in Europe, traveling and studying the methods in\r\nvogue in the hospitals of the old world. Returning to Kansas City in\r\n1912, she was employed by Drs. Jabez and Jackson, of that city, in a\r\nprofessional capacity, until she was called to her present post,\r\nSeptember 29, 1915. Since taking charge of the Atchison City Hospital,\r\nshe has given every evidence of being eminently fitted for the duties of\r\nher position and calling. Miss Power is a member of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal church, and is affiliated with the A. X. U. sorority, of\r\nDePauw University.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WILLIAM H. THOMPSON.\r\n\r\nThe late William H. Thompson, of Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison county,\r\nwas born on a Kentucky farm, near the city of Louisville, in 1838. His\r\nparents were Benjamin and Nancy (Baxter) Thompson, and both were born\r\nand reared in Kentucky, their old home being located on a small stream\r\ncalled Dry Beauty. Nancy Baxter Thompson was the belle of the\r\nneighborhood and was a famous beauty in her day. In 1848 the Thompsons\r\nmigrated from Kentucky to Platte county, Missouri, where they resided\r\nuntil the spring of 1860, and then came to Atchison county and purchased\r\nthe farm where William H. lived until his death, in 1884. Benjamin, the\r\nfather, was born in Kentucky in 1799, and died on his Kansas farm in\r\n1861, just after locating in this county. He was a man of fair\r\neducation, who was self-taught. He taught school in his native State,\r\nand his father was a famous hunter in the early days of Kentucky\r\nhistory. He disappeared while absent from home on a hunting expedition,\r\nand it is supposed that he was killed or captured by Indians, leaving a\r\nwife and three children. Times were hard and educational advantages were\r\neither very poor or absent altogether. Benjamin educated himself by\r\nnight study and home reading, and became well versed in books and\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Matilda Thompson_\r\n]\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Thompson was ten years of age when the family removed to\r\nMissouri, and he was reared to young manhood on the pioneer farm in\r\nPlatte county. After his marriage in 1862, he and his wife lived with\r\nhis widowed mother after the death of his father, October 26, 1861. He\r\ncame into possession of the home place and cultivated the land until his\r\ndemise in 1884. He was married July 6, 1862, to Matilda Thompson, and\r\neight children were born to this marriage: Annie, wife of Frank\r\nWilliamson, of California; Ada, wife of Henry Knobloch, of Atchison\r\ncounty; Robert Lee, at home with his mother; William H., a mining\r\nexpert, in Colorado; Gertrude, wife of Ed. Myer, of Atchison; Sirena\r\nElla, deceased wife of Patrick Burns; Benjamin Isaac, at home; Gladis,\r\ndeceased wife of Eugene Thornburg. The mother of these children was born\r\nin 1842 in Buchanan county, Missouri, a daughter of Isaac Thompson, born\r\nin New York State, on a farm near New York City, in 1804. The\r\ngrandfather and a great-uncle of Isaac came to America from England some\r\ntime before the American revolution, and became separated and never saw\r\neach other again. They were of Scotch origin. The paternal grandmother\r\nof Mrs. Thompson was a Miss Fiske of the New York family of Fiskes.\r\nIsaac Thompson married Elizabeth Fiscus in Indiana. In the year 1808,\r\nthe parents of Isaac Thompson removed from New York to Ohio and twelve\r\nyears later migrated westward to Shelby county, Indiana, where the\r\nparents died. After his marriage Isaac migrated to Buchanan county,\r\nMissouri, in about 1839, and developed a fine farm in that county. In\r\nabout 1847 he sold his farm in Missouri and set out on the long overland\r\njourney to Oregon. A large party were en route to this new country and\r\nthe outfit comprised twenty-one wagons and teams. An incident of this\r\njourney is here worth recording. While the emigrants were encamped for\r\nthe night at a point hundreds of miles from any human habitation, an\r\nIndian came to the camp and informed them that a band of hostile red men\r\nintended to attack them and destroy the outfit. A band of emigrant\r\nMormons drove up and joined them and they at once formed a corral with\r\ntheir wagons and prepared to defend themselves against the threatened\r\nattack, but the attack did not take place because of the preparations\r\nmade. The Thompson family remained in Oregon for five years. Isaac went\r\nto California in 1848 and engaged in gold mining. Mr. Thompson was\r\nfortunate in his prospecting and accumulated a small fortune. During the\r\nwinter of ’49 he was shipwrecked while making a voyage from California\r\nto his Oregon home, the vessel being driven far and out of its course by\r\nterrific storms and he was forced to spend the winter on the Sandwich\r\nIslands. After arriving home safely, he again went to California and\r\ncontinued his gold mining. In 1851 the family returned to the Middle\r\nWest. They boarded a ship at Portland, Ore., journeyed to San Francisco,\r\nwhere they took a ship for New Orleans. On the way down the coast the\r\nparty was landed on the west coast of the Isthmus of Panama and the\r\nemigrants were packed across the Isthmus to the east side, where they\r\nboarded a vessel which carried them to New York City, arriving there on\r\nChristmas day of 1851. From New York they went to Philadelphia where Mr.\r\nThompson had his gold minted at the Government mint. From Philadelphia\r\nthey traveled to Pittsburgh, and here the children all contracted\r\nmeasles and two of them died. From Pittsburgh they went down the Ohio\r\nriver by steamer and up the Mississippi to St. Louis where they boarded\r\na Missouri river steamer which took them to Camden, Mo. Here the wife\r\nand mother died. At Camden Mr. Thompson purchased oxen and wagons and\r\ntook the family to Buchanan county, Missouri, arriving there in the\r\nsummer of 1852. They lived in Missouri until 1856 and then made a\r\npermanent settlement in Kansas preëmpting land and locating on Walnut\r\ncreek in Mt. Pleasant township, about four miles southwest of the city\r\nof Atchison, which is now the Herzog farm. After eight years’ residence\r\nhere they again moved, this time to Illinois, where they lived for three\r\nyears and came again to Kansas, this time settling in Nemaha county.\r\nIsaac died in Nemaha county in 1871. His was certainly a rich and varied\r\nexperience and his life was filled with adventure and continual changes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Matilda Thompson, widow of William H., although having attained the\r\nage of three score and thirteen years, is active, spry and in full\r\npossession of her mental faculties. She is a wonderful woman for her age\r\nand is fond of relating reminiscences of the old days when the family\r\ncrossed the plains and traveled half way around the world in quest of\r\nriches and adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOHN HENRY NASS.\r\n\r\nWhen the soul of the late John Henry Nass departed from its earthly\r\nhabitation to go to his Maker, the city of Atchison lost one of its\r\nexcellent citizens and merchants who had lived all of his life in the\r\ncity of his birth. The late J. H. Nass was born in Atchison, February\r\n15, 1865, a son of Jacob and Johanna Nass, both of whom were born and\r\nreared in Germany and emigrated from the Fatherland in 1856, to America.\r\nThey first settled at Weston, Mo., but a short time later came to\r\nAtchison, Kan., where Jacob Nass became the first brick manufacturer of\r\nthe city. He erected the first brick plant and made brick for many of\r\nthe large brick buildings still standing in the city. Jacob Nass\r\ncontinued actively in the brick business until 1875, when he retired and\r\nthe business was carried on by his four sons. During the course of his\r\nbusiness career he established the hardware store which was later owned\r\nby his son, the subject of this review. He left at his demise, in 1899,\r\na considerable estate consisting of the brick plant, a hardware store,\r\nand real estate. Jacob and Johanna Nass were the parents of six\r\nchildren, namely: Werner, J. H., Theodore, Herman, all living in\r\nAtchison; Gertrude, and Mary Nass, who is caring for her aged mother.\r\n\r\nJ. H., or Henry Nass, as he was better known by his friends and\r\nassociates, was reared in Atchison and attended the parochial schools\r\nand St. Benedict’s College. At the age of sixteen years he entered his\r\nfather’s hardware store, and took complete charge of the business when\r\nhe attained the age of eighteen years. In 1886, with a partner named\r\nFrank Hess, of Weston, Mo., he purchased the hardware store of his\r\nfather. Six years later he bought out his partner and became the sole\r\nowner of the store, which he conducted until his demise, in 1903. He was\r\nmarried September 27, 1893, to Bertha Fleming, who bore him children as\r\nfollows: Charles, born September 16, 1895, educated in St. Benedict’s\r\nCollege, and is now in the employ of the Dolan Mercantile Company of\r\nAtchison; Raymond, born July 31, 1898, a graduate of St. Benedict’s\r\nCollege, and is now with the Harwi Hardware Company of Atchison; Rose,\r\nborn October 31, 1899, at home with her mother; Margarette, born June 2,\r\n1901, student in St. Louis parochial school; William, born November 19,\r\n1902, a student in a St. Louis school; Henry John, born December 7,\r\n1903, and died at the age of eighteen months. Mrs. Nass is justly proud\r\nof her children and has endeavored to rear them so that they will lead\r\nupright lives and be a credit to her and the public. The Nass home is\r\nlocated near St. Benedict’s College, and it is a happy one at all times.\r\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Nass were married in 1893 their honeymoon trip\r\nincluded the World’s Fair at Chicago. She was born in Holland, a\r\ndaughter of Lambert and Rosa (Johnson) Fleming, both of whom were born\r\nand reared in Holland and married there, after which they immigrated to\r\nAmerica with their family and settled in Atchison where Lambert made\r\nwooden shoes for a time and later moved to a farm where he died June 15,\r\n1880. Mrs. Fleming died in 1903.\r\n\r\nJ. H. Nass was moderately successful in his business pursuits, and left\r\nhis family comfortably provided for. He was a Democrat but did not take\r\na very active interest in political matters. He was a member of St.\r\nBenedict’s Catholic Church. His life was a good and useful one and his\r\nmain interest was in the well being of his family, of whom he was very\r\nthoughtful and treated kindly and justly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FRANK M. WOODFORD.\r\n\r\nFrank M. Woodford, the well known cashier of the Atchison Savings Bank,\r\nwas born at Niles, Mich., November 29, 1874.

Both parents were\r\nmembers of the Methodist church.\r\n\r\nJames L., Jr., the subject of this sketch, grew up in Lancaster\r\ntownship, and attended school in district No. 44. He remained at home\r\nwith his parents until they died. He then bought 320 acres in Kapioma\r\ntownship and built an unusually fine residence at a cost of about\r\n$4,000. The interior is finished in white oak, and a cement basement\r\nunderlies the house, and all modern conveniences have been installed,\r\nincluding hot and cold running water. He keeps all of his buildings\r\npainted and in repair so that everything around the place presents a\r\nfresh and orderly appearance. Horses are Mr. Armstrong’s hobby, and\r\nseveral times he has won prizes at the Effingham fair with his\r\nPercherons, and now has four thoroughbred Percherons registered. He is a\r\nshareholder in the Muscotah elevator. He is unmarried and has a man and\r\nhis wife, who care for the household. Mr. Armstrong is a member of the\r\nChristian church and has affiliated himself with the Republican party.\r\nHe is a member of the Percheron Society of America. He has received as\r\nhigh as $600 for Percheron horses bred on his place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JOHN FERRIS.\r\n\r\nA man’s usefulness in his community need not necessarily be confined to\r\nworking entirely for his own individual aggrandizement, and there are\r\nfrequently found conspicuous examples of good citizenship who are broad-\r\nminded and enterprising enough to extend their activities outward, so as\r\nto embrace the well-being of their fellowmen. John Ferris, banker and\r\nprosperous farmer, of Center township, Atchison county, is a shining\r\nexample of broad and upright citizenship, with whom family, church and\r\nsocial ties have been preëminent during his long residence in the\r\ncounty. Successful as a farmer and stockman, his ambitions have led him\r\ninto banking pursuits with considerable success to his credit. His\r\ndeeply religious nature having endowed him with a love for church work,\r\nmany fruitful years of his life have been devoted to Sunday school and\r\nchurch work, which have won him high esteem and infinite respect among\r\nthe people of his neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-eight years of Mr. Ferris’ residence in Center township have\r\nbeen productive of much material good on his part, and he is rated as\r\none of the really successful men of the county. This period marks his\r\nrise from comparative poverty to a position of affluence and prestige,\r\nattained by few citizens. Mr. Ferris saw opportunity and embraced it,\r\nand has made good in more ways than one.\r\n\r\nJohn Ferris is a man whose pluck and industry have brought him out of a\r\nlong struggle with high honors. Starting out in life as a poor boy, he\r\nworked long and hard, until now he lives in comfort and security. Mr.\r\nFerris was born at Sharonville, Ohio, November 25, 1860, and is a son of\r\nPeter and Hettie (Phares) Ferris, who were the parents of seven\r\nchildren, as follows: John, the subject of this sketch; Joseph,\r\nWinchester, Kan.; Alice, wife of W. T. Birt, Topeka, Kan.; Louvinca,\r\nwife of F. L. Stephens, Topeka, Kan.; Thomas, Mt. Pleasant township,\r\nAtchison county; Peter, farmer, on old Eastman place, Center township,\r\nAtchison county, and Mrs. Della Coppinger, deceased. The father was born\r\nAugust 8, 1839, in Sharonville, Hamilton county, Ohio. He was a son of\r\nJohn and Rebecca (Myers) Ferris, natives of Pennsylvania, who came to\r\nOhio as early settlers, in 1804. The father of John Ferris, subject of\r\nthis sketch, was reared on the farm in Ohio. He came to Kansas in 1878,\r\nand settled in Osborne county. Two years later, after being starved out\r\nby the ravages of the grasshoppers and the hot winds, which burned up\r\nhis crops, he went to Rawlins county, Kansas, where he preëmpted 640\r\nacres of land. He did not live there, but came to Nortonville, Kan., and\r\nbegan work as a laborer and farmer.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 he came to Center township, where he rented for five years. He\r\nthen rented 640 acres south of Nortonville. In 1892 he and his son,\r\nJohn, the subject of this sketch, bought 160 acres in Jefferson county.\r\nThen, for a number of years, they bought and sold farms in Atchison and\r\nJefferson counties, until 1903, when they bought the farm of 215 acres,\r\nwhich John and his father are working. This land is located in Center\r\ntownship and includes the northwest quarter of section 3 and the\r\nsouthwest quarter of section 34, and includes ten acres of natural\r\ntimber. He has thirty acres of alfalfa and fifty acres in corn each\r\nyear. Mr. Ferris also devotes considerable attention to his stock. He\r\nkeeps only graded animals on his farm, and makes a specialty of feeding\r\nhogs and cattle for the market. He started out with little capital, and\r\nhad to begin as a laborer at day wages, but he saved his earnings and\r\ninvested them wisely, and, now, besides being a substantial farmer, he\r\nis a shareholder and president of the State Bank of Cummings. Mr. Ferris\r\nis unmarried. His mother was born in Little Rock, Ark., in 1840. She is\r\na daughter of Joseph and Matilda (Todd) Phares. The father came from New\r\nJersey, and the mother from Tennessee. In politics, Mr. Ferris has\r\nidentified himself with the Republican party. He is a member of the\r\nPardee Methodist Episcopal Church and takes an active part in its\r\norganization. He is a steward, and for many years has been\r\nsuperintendent of the Sunday school. He is a member of the Ancient Free\r\nand Accepted Masons, and of the Independent Order of Odd Fellow lodges\r\nof Cummings. Mr. Ferris is a conspicuous example of the self-made man.\r\nHis career proves the possibilities of a man, who, though handicapped by\r\nlack of capital, is willing to work consistently and save judiciously.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MARCUS J. LAIRD.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Laird family in Kansas begins three score years ago,\r\nin the old days when the first sturdy pioneers were coming from the\r\nolder states to find new homes in the unpeopled waste of Kansas, and to\r\nbreak the way for others who have since followed in increasing numbers.\r\nIt is a long reach which witnesses the transformation of a wilderness of\r\nprairie and woods to a beautiful, productive landscape of peace and\r\nplenty, but Marcus J. Laird and his wife have been fortunate in growing\r\nto maturity with Atchison county. Few families in this county can claim\r\nan older lineage than the Lairds or Cummings families, and no family is\r\nmore respected than that of Marcus J. Laird. His father, J. B. Laird,\r\nwas one of the earliest pioneers of Atchison county, and on the other\r\nhand the father of Mrs. Laird was another pioneer. William Cummings, who\r\nfounded the town of Cummings, thus leaving a monument which will\r\nperpetuate his name for all time to come. Through the medium of these\r\nhistorical annals of Atchison county these pioneers will be duly honored\r\nand this volume is dedicated to their everlasting memory in order that\r\nthe story of Atchison county might be transmitted truthfully and\r\naccurately to posterity.\r\n\r\nMarcus J. Laird has been successively, farmer, merchant and postmaster,\r\nand is proud of the fact that he is a native born citizen of Kansas, and\r\na son of one of the earliest pioneers of the State. Like a good many men\r\nwho have been reared to farm life, after a successful career as merchant\r\nand public official, he has returned to the farm where living is sure\r\nand certain and a competence is the inevitable reward of years of labor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _M J Laird._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Britamore Laird_\r\n]\r\n\r\nMarcus J. Laird was born August 26, 1860, in Center township, Atchison\r\ncounty, and is a son of James B. and Marinda (Martin) Laird, who were\r\nthe parents of fourteen children as follows: Mary died in infancy;\r\nThomas died in infancy; James W., Jackson county, Kansas; Marcus, the\r\nsubject of this sketch; Abraham, Jefferson county, Kansas; Mrs. Emma\r\nLeland, Atchison, Kan.; John, deceased; Ulysses, deceased; Rose, wife of\r\nC. Barnes, Chase county, Kansas; Robert, Jackson county, Kansas; Paul, a\r\nteacher, Durant, Okla.; Mrs. Amanda Hanson, Nortonville, Kan.; Mrs.\r\nMabel McDonald, Muscotah, Kan., and Frank, Seattle, Wash. James B.\r\nLaird, the father, was born in Zanesville, Ohio, June 13, 1834, and was\r\na son of Thomas and Elton (Saffle) Laird, both natives of Pennsylvania.\r\nThe Lairds are of Scotch descent. James was brought up on his father’s\r\nfarm, and when he was thirteen years of age his parents removed to\r\nLivingston, Mo., where he grew to manhood. He then went to Buchanan\r\ncounty, Missouri, where he was married to Marinda Martin, the wedding\r\ntaking place at DeKalb, Mo., in 1854. Marinda (Martin) Laird was born\r\nAugust 1, 1836, in Morgan county, Indiana. She is a daughter of Hanson\r\nand Mary (Holman) Martin. Her father was a farmer in Kentucky before\r\ncoming to Atchison county, Kansas, in 1856, where he died in 1878, and\r\nthe mother died in 1840, at the age of thirty years.\r\n\r\nJames B. Laird and his bride came to Kansas in the fall of 1854 and\r\nsettled in Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison county, where they\r\nhomesteaded 160 acres of prairie and timber land. They drove from\r\nMissouri in a covered wagon pulled by oxen. Atchison, Kan., had but one\r\nhouse at that time; it had been moved there from Missouri. James Laird\r\nbuilt a sawmill on his farm the first year he was there and sawed 1,000\r\nfeet of lumber, but a flood swept it all down into Crooked creek. They\r\nbuilt a log cabin on the place, and the first child, Mary, was born\r\nthere. The fact that Mt. Pleasant, which was only three miles away,\r\nprovided a nearby market, helped the Lairds out considerably. They\r\nfarmed the homestead until 1860, when they sold it for $900 and moved\r\nfarther west and bought 276 acres in Center township. This property\r\nbecame the old home place and the Lairds owned it for many years.\r\n\r\nJames B. Laird moved to Cummings and conducted a general merchandise\r\nstore for a few years preceding his death, in 1892. The widow returned\r\nto the farm with the children, where she brought them up and educated\r\nthem. In 1909 she left the home place and has since lived with her\r\nchildren, and at present she lives with Marcus, the subject of this\r\nsketch. Marcus J. Laird grew up on the home place and attended school in\r\ndistrict No. 36, Center township, and at the age of sixteen he left home\r\nand worked as a farm hand for about a year, and later rented land from\r\nhis father. In 1883, at the age of twenty, he bought sixty acres in\r\nCenter township and farmed it a year when he traded it for a stock of\r\nmerchandise at Cummings and was in partnership with Nelson Cox there for\r\nfive years. Selling his interest in the business he rented land and\r\nfarmed for a while. In 1892 he bought the place which he now owns and\r\nhas increased the original eighty acres to 104. He has always kept good\r\nstock on his place and takes pride in keeping his animals up to\r\nstandard. In 1884 Mr. Laird married Britamore Cummings, who was born\r\nAugust 20, 1866, in Center township, Atchison county. She is a daughter\r\nof William and Sarah (Quiet) Cummings. Her father was a founder of\r\nCummings, Kan., and was a native of Pennsylvania. He came to Kansas in\r\n1855 and engaged in farming. He died July 27, 1900, at the age of\r\neighty-six. The mother, Sarah, was born in Illinois and is now living in\r\nKansas City, Kan. Five children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Laird, as\r\nfollows: James W., Kansas City, Mo.; Meda B., wife of L. Reynolds,\r\nCenter township, Atchison county, Kansas; Anna McKanna, living at home;\r\nEdith Hammer, Effingham, Kan.; Blanche, a teacher, living at home. Mr.\r\nLaird is a Republican. He was postmaster of Cummings for thirteen years.\r\nHe is a member of the Baptist church and of the Independent Order of Odd\r\nFellows and Ancient Order of United Workmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ALLEN T. BILDERBACK.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Bilderback and Johnson families in Kansas goes back\r\nto the old freighting and pioneer days when the hardships of the first\r\nsettlers were many and conveniences were few. The father of Allen T.\r\nBilderback, whose name heads this review, was one of the early stage\r\ncoach drivers whose route took him on many journeys from Kansas to\r\nDenver, and other Colorado points. Aaron Bilderback drove a stage coach\r\nfrom Atchison to Denver and Central City, Colo., beginning in 1864, for\r\nseveral years, until he finally settled on a farm in Center township,\r\nAtchison county. Jesse R. Johnson, grandfather of Mrs. Bilderback, had\r\nthe honor of assisting in establishing the first Methodist church in\r\nKansas, and Methodism is said to have had its origin in the State from a\r\nSunday school which was started in his home at Oak Mills, nearly sixty\r\nyears ago. From this small beginning a great religious denomination had\r\nits inception in the new State of Kansas.\r\n\r\nAllen T. Bilderback, with whom this review is directly concerned, is a\r\nnative born Kansan, a man of good education, who has been useful as an\r\neducator and farmer during his residence in his native county. He was\r\nborn in Center township July 21, 1878, and is a son of Aaron and Sarah\r\n(Jones) Bilderback, who were the parents of two children: Allen, the\r\nsubject of this sketch, and Leslie, who lives in Atchison. The father\r\nwas born in Indiana September 17, 1843. When a young man he came to\r\nKansas in 1855, and freighted across the plains to Denver. The trail\r\nextended from Atchison to Denver, and Aaron Bilderback drove a stage\r\ncoach and a prairie schooner. He later bought forty acres of land just\r\nsouth of Cummings, Atchison county, where he remained a few years. In\r\nAugust, 1881, he bought the farm which his son now owns. He improved it\r\nand lived there until his death, January 4, 1890. Allen Bilderback’s\r\nmother was born in Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison county, in 1855. She\r\nwas a daughter of Vincent Jones, an early settler in Kansas. She died in\r\n1885, at the age of thirty years. Both parents died when Allen was very\r\nyoung, and he was brought up by his uncle, Gabriel T. Bilderback. He\r\nattended school in District No. 36, Center township, and later attended\r\nthe Atchison county high school at Effingham. At the age of twenty-one\r\nhe began teaching in District No. 19, Mt. Pleasant township. In 1902 he\r\nwent to Granada, Colo., where he started a livery business. Three years\r\nlater he returned to Atchison county and taught school again. After a\r\nterm of teaching, he took charge of the old home place and engaged in\r\nfarming. He now owns 149 acres and has graded stock.\r\n\r\nOn March 28, 1906, Mr. Bilderback married Edith K. Jones, who was born\r\nNovember 15, 1884, near Mayetta, Jackson county, Kansas. She also was a\r\nteacher before her marriage, having taught for a number of years in\r\nJackson county, Kansas. She is a daughter of Samuel R. and Sarah J.\r\n(Johnson) Jones. The father was born in Miami county, Ohio, and came to\r\nAtchison county in 1856, settling near Oak Mills. For a time he farmed\r\nthere, at first using oxen, and lived in a log cabin. A number of years\r\nlater he moved to Jackson county, Kansas, where he died January 23,\r\n1916. His wife was born in Virginia, a daughter of Jesse and Nancy\r\n(Davis) Johnson. Her father was born in New York April 11, 1819, and\r\ncame to Kansas in 1834, settling near Oak Mills, and helped organize the\r\nfirst Methodist church in Kansas. For some time a Bible class met at his\r\nhouse, and when it grew to a membership of forty, a Methodist church was\r\norganized by Rev. Bowen. That was the origin of Methodism in Kansas.\r\nJesse Johnson died in 1904. and his wife died in 1907, at the age of\r\neighty-three. Mr. and Mrs. Bilderback have three children, all living at\r\nhome, as follows: Allen, Jr., born March 18, 1907; Sarah Naomi, born\r\nJuly 27, 1909, and Lucile Elizabeth, born June 8, 1913. Mr. Bilderback\r\nis a member of the Methodist church, and now holds the office of\r\ntrustee. He belongs to the Modern Woodmen of America, and is president\r\nof the farmers’ institute at Cummings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM M. NITZ.\r\n\r\nAmerica is proud of her citizens of German birth, and glories in their\r\naccomplishments, their successes, and affluence, wherever they are\r\nlocated. It is an undisputable fact that the farmers of German birth or\r\nancestry in Kansas today are rated as among the most prosperous of this\r\ngreat commonwealth. Atchison county has its quota of successful German\r\nagriculturists, and William M. Nitz, of Center township, is one who is\r\ndeserving of special mention. It is a noteworthy rise from a poor German\r\nimmigrant boy to become one of the large landed proprietors of the\r\ncounty, but Mr. Nitz has accomplished all this. His 400 acres or more of\r\nland in Center township were all obtained by hard labor, economy,\r\nintelligence and good financial judgment. The rearing of his large\r\nfamily of nine children, and their gift to the county and country as\r\nsturdy and upright citizens, is alone a matter for praiseworthy mention.\r\n\r\nWilliam M. Nitz was born in Germany, March 26, 1864, and is a son of\r\nLudwig and Johanna Louisa (Linstad) Nitz, who were the parents of eleven\r\nchildren, eight of whom are living. The father was born in Germany, in\r\nAugust, 1836, and left his native land in 1883 with his wife and one\r\nchild, coming to America. He came west and worked a year as a laborer,\r\nand then bought eighty acres of land in Doniphan county, Kansas, where\r\nhe farmed until 1911. He then removed to Kansas City, Mo., where he and\r\nhis wife now live. His wife, the mother of William Nitz, was also born\r\nin Germany, in 1845. William N. Nitz immigrated to America when he was\r\nfifteen years of age. He worked in Pennsylvania as a farm hand for a\r\nyear, then he came to Doniphan county, Kansas, where he also worked as a\r\nfarm hand. He then rented land in Lancaster township, Atchison county,\r\nfor two years, when he returned to Doniphan county, where he bought\r\neighty acres of land. In 1902 he sold out and bought 307 acres in Center\r\ntownship. This farm was poorly improved, the house and barn being old\r\nand dilapidated. Mr. Nitz proceeded to rebuild and improve the\r\nbuildings. He is now located in section 11, and owns 427 acres of land.\r\nHe is a fancier of good mules and keeps graded stock on his farm. Mr.\r\nNitz, together with several other farmers in his neighborhood, hold\r\nstock in a thresher outfit which they operate jointly.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Mr. Nitz married Miss Lena Lawson, a native of Kansas, born\r\nFebruary 27, 1873. Mr. and Mrs. Nitz are the parents of eleven children:\r\nGeorge, born January 12, 1893, farmer, Center township; Charles, born\r\nNovember 11, 1891, on his father’s farm of 120 acres; Otto, born August\r\n28, 1894, living at home; Johanna and Nava, deceased; Edward, born June\r\n26, 1898, living at home; Oscar, born January 28, 1903; Irvin, born\r\nOctober 22, 1906, and Ida, born March 5, 1913, living at home, and two\r\nchildren died in infancy. Mr. Nitz is an independent in politics and he\r\nand his wife are members of the Lutheran church, as are Charles and\r\nGeorge. Though Mr. Nitz could not read or write the English language\r\nvery well when a young man, he has always been a student of new\r\nconditions, and was quick to learn the customs and language of his\r\nadopted country and has proved himself to be a useful member of his\r\ncommunity. Of late years he has become very proficient in reading\r\nEnglish and keeps abreast of the times by reading the daily newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HENRY GLATTFELDER.\r\n\r\nHenry Glattfelder, farmer, Center township, Atchison county, Kansas, was\r\nborn in the township where he now lives, September 16, 1871, and is a\r\nson of Henry and Margaret (Kuntz) Glattfelder. They were the parents of\r\nseven children: Elizabeth married J. Meyers, died in Atchison. Kan.;\r\nMaggie married widower of her deceased sister, and he is a baker and\r\nmerchant, Atchison; Anna, wife of J. Kuhn, Atchison, Kan.; Fannie\r\nmarried H. H. Severs, Manning, Iowa; Mary married M. L. Dilgert,\r\nAtchison; Bertha married W. A. Dilgert, Mt. Pleasant township, and\r\nHenry, the subject of this sketch. The father was born in Switzerland,\r\nJanuary, 1827. He came to America and settled in Atchison county, on a\r\nrented farm in Mt. Pleasant township. He worked this from 1863 until his\r\ndeath in 1871. The mother was also born in Switzerland, December 18,\r\n1832, and died in Atchison, Kan., in 1904.\r\n\r\nHenry Glattfelder, the subject of this sketch, attended the district\r\nschools of Center township, and grew up on his mother’s farm and began\r\nfarming for himself when he was twenty-two years old. He bought 125\r\nacres of land in Center township, and now owns 130 acres. He has made\r\nmany improvements on his place since taking possession of it, and keeps\r\ngraded stock. In 1894, the year in which he started out for himself, he\r\nwas united in marriage with Miss Anna Cline, a daughter of Peter J. and\r\nBersheba Cline. Mrs. Glattfelder was born March 21, 1877, in Mt.\r\nPleasant township, Atchison county, Kansas. Her father was a native of\r\nIowa, and her mother of Missouri. To Mr. and Mrs. Glattfelder have been\r\nborn six children: Leona, Ellsworth, Harold, Kennith, Lucile, all living\r\nat home. One child, Henry, is deceased. Mr. Glattfelder is an\r\nindependent voter. He attends church but does not profess any creed. He\r\nis a practical farmer and is a liberal giver to all movements for the\r\nbenefit of the community. Never has Mr. Glattfelder allowed his selfish\r\ninterests to stand in the way of the community’s progress and he has\r\nproven himself a patriotic citizen of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THOMAS W. TUCKER.\r\n\r\nThomas W. Tucker, live stock dealer, Effingham, Kan., is a native of\r\nAtchison county, and has lived all of his life in Benton township. He\r\nwas born on a farm three and one-half miles northeast of Effingham,\r\nNovember 27, 1872. His parents were J. Martin and Polly (Cummings)\r\nTucker, both of whom were born in Crawford county, Indiana. J. M. Tucker\r\nwas the son of Sloan Tucker, also a native of Indiana, who emigrated to\r\nKansas in 1860. When he attained young manhood the father of Thomas W.\r\nrented land for a few years in Doniphan county, and then bought a farm\r\nin Atchison county. He prospered and became the owner of two farms in\r\nBenton township, aggregating 280 acres. When old age came he and Mrs.\r\nTucker retired to a home in Effingham, where they spent the remainder of\r\ntheir days in peace and comfort. J. M. Tucker was born in 1831 and died\r\nin 1896, and his wife was born in 1838 and died in October, 1910. Mr.\r\nTucker served in the Kansas State militia during the Civil war. The\r\nfollowing children survive J. Martin and Polly Tucker: John R., a farmer\r\nliving west of Effingham; Mrs. C. C. Anderson, of Atchison, Kan.; Thomas\r\nW.; Albert, a resident of Atchison.\r\n\r\nThomas W. Tucker attended the Maple Grove school when a boy and lived on\r\nthe home farm, assisting in its operation, until he attained the age of\r\ntwenty-two years. In 1894 he engaged in the livery business in Effingham\r\nand continued operating the same until 1898, when he sold out and spent\r\none year cultivating the home farm. After his marriage in 1898, he\r\nremoved to the Noffsinger farm, east of Effingham, and managed it for\r\nsix years, returning to Effingham in 1905. While on the farm he became\r\ninterested in the buying and selling of live stock, and since taking up\r\na permanent residence in Effingham, he has devoted his entire time and\r\nattention to this business with signal success. His live stock dealings\r\nembrace the purchase and shipment of over seventy-five carloads of stock\r\nyearly, which is no inconsiderable item and involves transactions\r\nrequiring capital of several thousands of dollars. He is also interested\r\nin real estate and farm lands and has made several profitable deals in\r\nthis line. Mr. Tucker owns one of the best residences in Effingham and\r\nis the owner of some town lots.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1898 to Miss Maude Noffsinger, who was born and reared\r\non a farm, four miles southeast of Effingham, a daughter of Peter and\r\nMargaret Noffsinger, residing on their home place, east of Effingham.\r\nBoth Peter and Margaret Noffsinger are deceased, Mrs. Noffsinger dying\r\nin September, 1915. Mr. and Mrs. T. W. Tucker are the parents of two\r\nchildren: Ramona, aged fifteen years, and Maurice, aged eleven.\r\n\r\nMr. Tucker is a Republican in politics and is prominent in the affairs\r\nof his party, at present being the central committeeman of the Effingham\r\nprecinct, being a part of the county organization. He and his family are\r\nmembers of the Christian church. He is fraternally affiliated with the\r\nAncient Free and Accepted Masons, the Benevolent and Protective Order of\r\nElks, the Modern Woodmen, and the Knights and Ladies of Security.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              J. F. FLYNN.\r\n\r\nJ. F. Flynn, farmer, resides on the old Flynn homestead in Mt. Pleasant\r\ntownship, Atchison county, of which he is the owner and upon which his\r\nfather settled in March. 1855. Mr. Flynn was born on this farm, October\r\n8, 1855, and has lived all of his sixty years of life on the place.\r\nDuring this time he has simply grown up with Atchison county, and his\r\nearliest recollections were of the vast stretches of prairie in Atchison\r\ncounty, which were awaiting the homesteaders and settlers who have since\r\ntransformed the unpeopled wilderness into a land of homes and plenty.\r\nHis father was Jeremiah Flynn, who was born in County Cork, Ireland, and\r\nleft his native land when a young man and immigrated to America,\r\nlocating after a time in Kentucky, where he met Julia Sullivan, who was\r\nborn in his own native county in Ireland. The acquaintance ripened into\r\nlove and culminated in their marriage at Frankfort, Ky., September 24,\r\n1854. In March, 1855, they came to Kansas and settled on a tract of part\r\nprairie and part timber in Mt. Pleasant township where both lived and\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nJ. F. Flynn was the first born of ten children of Jeremiah and Julia\r\nFlynn. He received a common school education, supplemented with a course\r\nin bookkeeping at St. Patrick’s common school, district No. 14, after\r\nwhich he settled down to farming the home place, coming into possession\r\nof the homestead by inheritance and purchase after his father’s demise.\r\nFor several years he was a successful fruit grower, but of late has\r\ndevoted all of his time and activities to general farming.\r\n\r\nMr. Flynn was married March 31, 1880, to Mary Desmond, of Missouri, and\r\nto this union have been born five children: Kathrine, wife of John\r\nBegley, of Kansas City, Kan.; John E., at home, assisting his father in\r\nthe farm work; Joseph J., in Kansas City, Mo.; Julia and Mary, at home\r\nwith their parents.\r\n\r\nMr. Flynn is a Democrat in national politics, but is inclined to be an\r\nindependent voter who votes for the best man who seems qualified for the\r\noffice regardless of his political affiliations. He and all of his\r\nfamily are members of the Catholic church, which was the faith of his\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ERNEST C. HAZEL.\r\n\r\nIndustry and effort are generally rewarded. The successful man is\r\nusually found filling the niche for which he was designed. It affords\r\nsome satisfaction to chronicle the facts in the life of a self-made man\r\nwho has won an enviable place in the commercial and manufacturing life\r\nin his home city. Ernest C. Hazel, vice-president and general manager of\r\nthe Lockwood-Hazel Printing and Stationery Company, of Atchison, has\r\nachieved his position by industrious application of talents which have\r\nenabled him to rise above the mediocre and general station of the\r\naverage man. Considerable credit is due him for having been a potent\r\nfactor in building up the extensive business which his firm enjoys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Ernest C. Hazel_\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Lockwood-Hazel Printing and Stationery Company was established in\r\n1912. It originated as the Trade Printing Company in 1903. This was a\r\nsmall concern but grew constantly until the business reached its present\r\nproportions. The business is housed in the handsome new Masonic Temple\r\non Fifth and Kansas avenues, and occupies the first floor and basement\r\nof the building. The arrangements and equipment are the most modern\r\nwhich can be obtained and are especially adapted for a high grade\r\nquality of printing which this firm turns out. The greatest progress of\r\nthe firm has been made since its organization as the Lockwood-Hazel Co.,\r\nin 1912. The firm is composed of C. A. Lockwood, president and\r\ntreasurer, and E. C. Hazel, secretary and general manager. The firm\r\nmanufactures blank books and does general printing of the highest grade.\r\nThe line of printing includes county and bank supplies, loose leaf\r\nsystems, and embossed stationery. They supply leading banks with their\r\noutfits and deal extensively in wood and steel office furniture and\r\nequipments, and also vault accessories. C. A. Rowe is manager of the\r\nsales department which employs three traveling salesmen and the firm\r\nconducts a large mail order business in eight states. So excellent is\r\nthe product turned out and so fair is the treatment accorded a patron\r\nthat a first order supplied by this enterprising establishment leads to\r\nconstant repetitions from the purchaser when in need of supplies of the\r\ncharacter furnished.\r\n\r\nErnest C. Hazel was born March 30, 1875 in Newman, Ill. His parents were\r\nThomas and Lydia (Kinney) Hazel, natives of Virginia and Ohio,\r\nrespectively. Thomas Hazel was born in Page county, Virginia, a son of\r\nRichard and Elizabeth Hazel. He was a veteran of the Union army, and\r\nserved his country faithfully during the Civil war in Company E, of the\r\nTwelfth regiment, Illinois infantry. He served for two years under\r\nGeneral Grant and was under General Sherman’s command for two years and\r\nsix months. His first engagements were at Ft. Henry and Ft. Donelson. He\r\nfought in the battles of the Wilderness, Lookout Mountain, Mission\r\nRidge, Siege of Vicksburg, and was with Sherman on his victorious march\r\nfrom Atlanta to the sea. He enlisted at Springfield, Ill., at the first\r\ncall for volunteers and served until the end of the war. To the end of\r\nhis days he was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic. A brother,\r\nJohn, also fought in the Union army and like many other southern\r\nfamilies it was a house divided against itself and three brothers,\r\nRichard, Benjamin and William, fought on the side of the confederacy.\r\nLydia Hazel was born in Muskingum county, Ohio, and was the daughter of\r\nThomas C. and Levina Kinney.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the family emigrated from Newman, Ill., and settled on a farm\r\nnear Pawnee Rock, Kan., which the father had homesteaded. After spending\r\nsome years in developing the farm Thomas Hazel removed to Missouri, from\r\nwhere he came to Atchison in the year 1888. Here he lived a retired\r\nlife, dying November 19, 1904, at the age of sixty-seven years. Mrs.\r\nLydia Hazel resides with her daughter in Leavenworth, Kan. The Hazels\r\nare descendants from a fine old Virginian family and their ancestry\r\ntraces back to the colonial days.\r\n\r\nTo Lydia and Thomas Hazel were born six children, as follows: Mrs.\r\nElnora Allen, of Atchison; Mrs. Ida Stucker, of Leavenworth; Marion\r\nHazel, of Leavenworth; Ernest C. Hazel, of Atchison. Two children died\r\nin infancy.\r\n\r\nErnest C. Hazel was educated in the public schools of Atchison and\r\nlearned the trade of bookbinding with Mr. Caldwell, beginning at the age\r\nof fourteen years. After serving an apprenticeship of three years, he\r\nwas employed by the Haskell Show Printing Company. This concern was\r\nsucceeded by the Home Printing Company, and he was employed by them\r\nuntil 1901. For a period of two years he was a traveling salesman for\r\nthe Western Paper Company. In 1903 he entered the employ of the Trade\r\nPrinting Company, which was succeeded by the present firm in 1912. He\r\npurchased an interest in the firm in 1908.\r\n\r\nThe married life of Mr. Hazel has been a happy one, and has been in\r\nkeeping with his success in the business world. He was married March 30,\r\n1897, to Mary Elizabeth Semple, of Atchison, a daughter of Andrew and\r\nJennie Semple, both of whom were natives of Glasgow, Scotland. Andrew\r\nSemple was one of the pioneer contractors of Atchison. His last contract\r\nwas the Atchison county court house. Mr. Semple is deceased and his\r\nwidow still resides in Atchison.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Hazel have been born five children, namely:\r\nErnest C., Jr., seventeen years of age, and a student of Midland\r\nCollege; Robert R., fourteen years of age, and also a student at Midland\r\nCollege; Constance Marie, who died in infancy; Kenneth C., nine years of\r\nage, a pupil in the public schools, and Neola Christine, aged five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMr. Hazel finds time in the midst of his busy life to give considerable\r\nattention to civil and social affairs and is an active member of the\r\nChristian church of Atchison, in which thriving religious institution he\r\nand his wife are warmly appreciated for their good qualities. He is a\r\nRepublican in politics, and is fraternally affiliated with the Ancient\r\nFree and Accepted Masons, the Ancient Order of United Workmen, and the\r\nFraternal Aid Union, and also the United Commercial Travelers.\r\nPronounced ability, combined with an engaging personality, have won him\r\nthis high place in his home city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ALEXANDER H. CALVERT.\r\n\r\nAlexander H. Calvert, lumber and grain dealer, Muscotah, Kan., was born\r\non his father’s farm in Platte county, Missouri. He is a son of Warren\r\nCalvert, a native of Kentucky, whose ancestors were among the earliest\r\nsettlers in America. It is a matter of tradition that he was a\r\ndescendant of the original Lord Baltimore, or Cecil Calvert, who founded\r\nthe State of Maryland, in the seventeenth century. The father of Warren\r\nCalvert was a pioneer settler in Kentucky and was the owner of a large\r\nplantation. Warren Calvert was born in 1815 and died in 1875. With his\r\nwife, Lucy Calvert, he migrated from Kentucky, accompanied by his\r\nretinue of slaves, to form a part of the Kentucky colony which settled\r\nPlatte county, Missouri, in 1835. He was one of the original settlers in\r\nPlatte county, and operated a large tract of land. He and his wife,\r\nLucy, reared a family of nine children, namely: Presley Hawkins, a\r\nretired farmer of Muscotah; James Harvey, deceased banker of Muscotah,\r\nwho was a soldier in the Confederate army; Mrs. Anne May Buford,\r\ndeceased; John Hawkins, who died on his farm near Arrington in 1910;\r\nAmbrose Owens, living in California, near Los Angeles; Mrs. Ella (Burt)\r\nJackson, died in 1903.\r\n\r\nA. H. Calvert came to Kansas in the spring of 1878 and settled on a farm\r\nsouth of Muscotah in Atchison county. Three brothers came at this time,\r\nPresley H., James H. and himself. For a number of years Mr. Calvert\r\nrented land in Kapioma township and then purchased the farm of 220\r\nacres, which he owns. He rented land for over fifteen years and then\r\nbegan to buy land. His first farm of 135 acres was purchased in 1903,\r\nand he has continued to invest heavily in farm lands in the vicinity of\r\nMuscotah until he is now the owner of 700 acres, besides a small tract\r\nin Leavenworth county, Kansas.\r\n\r\nMr. Calvert resided on his farm until 1897 and then removed to Muscotah\r\nwhere he engaged in the lumber business under the firm name of Calvert &\r\nSharp. This partnership continued until 1902 when he purchased his\r\npartner’s interest in the business, which he has since operated. In\r\nNovember of 1905 he formed a partnership with M. E. Bevin, of Muscotah,\r\nand they purchased the grain elevator and engaged in the buying and\r\nshipping of grain. This firm also does an extensive live stock business,\r\nbuying and shipping several carloads of live stock during each year. In\r\naddition to his extensive business affairs, Mr. Calvert is a stockholder\r\nin the Muscotah State Bank.\r\n\r\nHis first marriage was with Miss Nora Rice in 1881. Two children (twins)\r\nwere born of this union, namely: Ella, wife of Will Warren, of Muscotah,\r\nwho served for seventeen years as assistant cashier of the Muscotah\r\nState Bank; Alma, a highly educated lady who studied in the Camden Point\r\nYoung Ladies’ Seminary, the Emporia Normal College, and received her\r\ndegree of Bachelor of Arts from Washburn College, at Topeka, now a\r\nteacher of mathematics in the Atchison city high school. The mother of\r\nthese children was a daughter of D. Rice, a native of Illinois, and a\r\npioneer settler of Atchison county. She died in 1883, at the age of\r\ntwenty-six years. In 1889 Mr. Calvert was united in marriage with Miss\r\nHattie Burt, of Platte county, Missouri, a daughter of John Burt, who\r\ncame from Indiana to Platte county. Three children have been born to\r\nthis marriage: George, conducting a garage at Effingham, Kan.;\r\nMarguerite, aged twenty-one years, a teacher, at present studying in\r\nWashburn College; Charles Cecil, aged fifteen years, a student in the\r\nAtchison County High School.\r\n\r\nMr. Calvert is an old-line Democrat and takes considerable interest in\r\nlocal and county political matters. He is a member of the Modern Woodmen\r\nand the Knights and Ladies of Security. A man of good education and\r\nattainments, he has succeeded in making his own way in the world and has\r\nrisen from comparative poverty to become one of the substantial and best\r\nknown citizens of the county.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN STODDARD.\r\n\r\nJohn Stoddard, a late resident of Muscotah, was born in Allegheny\r\ncounty, Pennsylvania, in 1833, and departed this life February 18, 1901.\r\nHe was the son of Robert and Margaret (Jordan) Stoddard. On the Stoddard\r\nside of the family the lineage is Scotch-Irish. John Stoddard grew to\r\nyoung manhood on the Pennsylvania farm, and received a good common\r\nschool education in his youth. When twenty years of age, fired by the\r\nstories of the riches being obtained in the gold fields of California,\r\nhe boarded a vessel in New York harbor. It carried him to Aspenwall, on\r\nthe east coast of the Isthmus, which he crossed on mule back. He then\r\nboarded the vessel, “Golden Rule,” which carried him to San Francisco,\r\nCal., from which city he journeyed to Sacramento, where he equipped\r\nhimself with a prospecting outfit, and for ten years followed the trail\r\nof the elusive metal. He spent this time in various mining campaigns and\r\nprospecting for gold. He returned home by re-tracing the same route\r\nwhich he had traveled on his way to California, and arrived in\r\nPennsylvania, not rich, but with considerable gold in his possession,\r\nand the remembrances of a wonderful experience.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return to his Pennsylvania home he removed to Iowa and\r\npurchased a farm, and was married there in 1869, after which he lived\r\nfive years on his first farm in Iowa, and then moved to another farm, on\r\nwhich he resided for seven years. In 1881 he came to Muscotah, Kan., and\r\ninvested in 320 acres of land near that city. Mr. Stoddard looked after\r\nhis farming interests and lived a retired life while in Muscotah, and\r\ndied there in 1901. Mr. Stoddard was married October 20, 1869, to Miss\r\nMartha Piggott, a native of Harrison county, Ohio, and a daughter of\r\nIsrael and Liddie (Goodwin) Piggott, the former a native of Belmont\r\ncounty, Ohio, and the latter a native of Westchester, Pa. The Piggott\r\nfamily originally came from Virginia, where the founder of the family in\r\nAmerica settled in early colonial days. Israel P. was an early settler\r\nin Iowa. To Mr. and Mrs. Stoddard were born four children: Grace, the\r\nwife of Dr. J. O. Ward, Horton, Kan,; Guy, a railway mail clerk, Los\r\nAngeles, Cal.; Alice V., the wife of J. C. Thurman, Los Angeles, Cal.;\r\nEva, wife of Carl Young, of Kansas City. Guy Stoddard, the son, who is\r\nlocated at Los Angeles, Cal., is a bright young man of more than\r\nordinary ability. After completing the course of study in the public\r\nschools of Muscotah, he graduated from the Atchison County High School\r\nat Effingham. Later, he attended college for a while. After completing\r\nhis education he became the owner and editor of the _Muscotah Record_.\r\nThe newspaper gained a wide prestige and was prosperous. After his\r\nmarriage to Miss Pearl Knox, of Muscotah, he and his wife removed to Los\r\nAngeles, where he became a member of the reportorial staff of the _Los\r\nAngeles Times_. He later entered the United States railway mail service\r\nat Los Angeles. John Stoddard, the subject of this review, was a\r\nDemocrat during the latter years of his life, and served two terms as\r\nmayor of Muscotah. Mrs. Stoddard is a member of the Congregational\r\nchurch of Muscotah, and spends a portion of her time each year in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            AARON B. EVANS.\r\n\r\nAaron B. Evans, pioneer auctioneer and livery proprietor, of Muscotah,\r\nAtchison county, was born April 16, 1857, in Union county, Tennessee, He\r\nwas a son of George W. and Orlena (Wolfenbarger) Evans. His mother was a\r\nnative of Granger county, Tennessee, and was of German extraction.\r\nGeorge W. Evans, the father, was the owner of a large farm on the south\r\nside of Clinch river, in Union county, Tennessee, just opposite the old\r\nhome of the Vansell family. A. B. Evans and M. C. Vansell, of\r\nGrasshopper township, were boys and play-mates together in Tennessee,\r\nand are first cousins. Like most boys living in the South, during that\r\nperiod, and in the time of the Civil war, their early education was\r\nsadly neglected. In fact, during the war the school system of Tennessee\r\nwas entirely destroyed. When Aaron B. Evans was twenty years of age he\r\nleft home and came direct to Kansas. He had no means wherewith to pay\r\nhis transportation, and borrowed sufficient money from a neighbor to pay\r\nhis railroad fare to Atchison. When he arrived at Atchison he had no\r\nmoney with which to pay for a meal or hotel accommodation. He and M. C.\r\nVansell, who accompanied him on the trip, walked from Atchison to\r\nKennekuk, where they stopped at the home of their uncle, M. C. Willis,\r\nfor a few days.\r\n\r\nMr. Evans’ first employment in Kansas was on the farm of Dave Moore,\r\nlocated three and one-half miles northeast of Kennekuk, in Atchison\r\ncounty. He worked for various farmers in the county until he saved\r\nsufficient money to buy his first farm. For two years previous to his\r\nmarriage, in 1881, he was in the employ of George Storch, who at that\r\ntime was engaged in the general mercantile business at Muscotah, Kan. In\r\n1881 Mr. Evans moved to a farm three miles northeast of Kennekuk, where\r\nhe resided for three years, and was very successful in his farming\r\noperations. He then bought ninety-six acres of land near Kennekuk, which\r\nhe cultivated for two years, when he sold it at a good profit. After\r\nselling his first farm he moved to a rented farm west of Muscotah, which\r\nhe operated for one year, and invested in partnership with M. C.\r\nVansell, and divided the land in a quarter section of raw prairie land,\r\nthree miles northwest of Muscotah. He erected improvements on this farm\r\nand resided upon it for eighteen years. He sold his farm in 1901, and in\r\nMay of the same year invested in a livery barn, and also entered upon\r\nhis career of auctioneer, which he has followed since that time with\r\nconsiderable success. Mr. Evans also maintains a breeding stable, for\r\nthe equipment of which he went to Lexington, Ky., in 1906 and purchased\r\nthe best jack to be had in the Lexington market, and shipped him to\r\nMuscotah. This animal is the first high class jack ever brought to this\r\nsection of Kansas. During this same year Mr. Evans also bought a pure\r\nbred black Percheron stallion, which he lost during the first year of\r\nhis ownership. At the present time the Evans barn stands two high class\r\njacks and one pure bred grey Percheron stallion.\r\n\r\nOn January 27, 1881, Mr. Evans was united in marriage with Recy\r\nTannyhill, who was born in Marion county, Ohio, a daughter of William\r\nand Nancy Tannyhill, both of whom were natives of the Buckeye State, and\r\nemigrated to Kansas when Mrs. Evans was but eight years of age, and\r\nsettled on a farm in Grasshopper township, Atchison county. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nEvans are the parents of seven children: Elizabeth, the wife of J. L.\r\nMorgan, St. Joseph, Mo.; William George, a farmer, Grasshopper township;\r\nFred, who is associated with his father in the livery business; Orlena,\r\nthe wife of Bert Annis, Chicago, Ill.; Nannie, living in Des Moines,\r\nIowa; Nora, St. Joseph, Mo., and Frank, at home.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Evans are members of the Christian Advent church of\r\nMuscotah. He is a stanch and true Republican of the uncompromising\r\nvariety, and has been one of the political leaders of his section of\r\nAtchison county for many years, serving as delegate several times to the\r\nRepublican county conventions. He has always been an advocate of\r\neducational advancement, and has offered his children every opportunity\r\nto acquire a good common school education. He was one of the pioneers in\r\nthe auctioneering profession in Atchison county, and was the second man\r\nto enter the business of crying sales.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RALPH A. ALLISON.\r\n\r\nRalph A. Allison, the capable, efficient and obliging cashier of the\r\nMuscotah State Bank, was born and reared in the town where he resides.\r\nHe was born July 1, 1889, at Muscotah, Kan., a son of Webster C. and\r\nIrene (Alexander) Allison, the former a native of Illinois, and the\r\nlatter of Wisconsin. Webster C. Allison was born in 1861 on his father’s\r\nfarm in Illinois, and was the son of John Allison, who was born and\r\nreared in Pennsylvania, and immigrated to Illinois in the pioneer days\r\nof that State. Webster C. Allison attended the district schools of his\r\nnative State, and assisted his father on the home farm until he was\r\neighteen years of age. He then came to Kansas, where his first\r\nemployment was on a farm west of Muscotah, owned and operated by A. B.\r\nHarvey. He worked for Mr. Harvey for one year, and then went to Jackson\r\ncounty, Kan., where he broke up and developed a tract of prairie land\r\nwhich he purchased. He improved his farm and cultivated it with profit\r\nuntil 1888, when he came to Muscotah and established a hardware store\r\nwhich he conducted successfully for twenty-five years. In 1913 Mr.\r\nAllison disposed of his interests in Muscotah, and removed to Horton,\r\nKan., where he is now conducting a hardware and implement business.\r\n\r\nTo Webster C. and Irene Allison were born the following children: Lola,\r\nwife of Luther Cortelyou, assistant cashier of the First National Bank\r\nof Parsons, Kan.; Minnie, wife of Charles Hail, an oil operator, LeRoy,\r\nKan.; Jennie, wife of William McClennon, Owasa, Iowa; Ralph A., with\r\nwhom this review is directly concerned. Ralph A. received his primary\r\neducation in the public schools of Muscotah, after which he completed a\r\ncourse in the Atchison County High School at Effingham, from which\r\ninstitution he graduated in 1907. For one year following his graduation\r\nhe served as stenographer for a wholesale fruit company, and then\r\nentered his father’s hardware store in Muscotah, where he remained until\r\nthe stock was sold in 1913. In 1914 be became manager of the Farmers\r\nElevator Company of Muscotah. He became cashier of the Muscotah State\r\nBank July 1, 1914, and is filling this responsible position to the\r\nsatisfaction of the bank patrons, and in a manner which reflects credit\r\nupon himself and the bank’s officials and stockholders. Mr. Allison was\r\nmarried in April, 1912, to Miss Ella Ellson, who was born in Muscotah, a\r\ndaughter of Charles Ellson, proprietor of the local meat market. Mr. and\r\nMrs. R. A. Allison are the parents of one daughter, Priscilla, born\r\nApril 17, 1913.\r\n\r\nMr. Allison is a Republican in politics, and is a member of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal church. He is affiliated with the Ancient Free and\r\nAccepted Masons and the Modern Woodmen of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FRED SUTTER.\r\n\r\nFred Sutter, president of the Farmers and Merchants State Bank of\r\nEffingham, is a native son of Atchison county and prominently identified\r\nwith the affairs of his county. Mr. Sutter is rightly considered as one\r\nof the real leaders of the county, and it can be said of him that he has\r\nmet with unusual success in anything which he has undertaken. To him and\r\nhis influence, more than any other individual, the farmers of the county\r\nare indebted for the inauguration of a skilled county farm expert.\r\nKindred things of this character in behalf of the welfare of the county\r\nhave been Mr. Sutter’s hobby for several years past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Fred Sutter_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Fred Sutter_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fred Sutter’s Residence.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFred Sutter was born July 20, 1869, on a pioneer farm in Walnut\r\ntownship, and is a son of Fred Sutter, who was born in Bath, Germany, in\r\n1827, and immigrated to America about 1844, and died in Atchison county\r\nin September of 1887. Fred Sutter, Sr., landed at New York City and made\r\nhis way from there to St. Louis, Mo., where he married Fredericka\r\nMiller, who was born at Bath, Germany, September 23, 1837. She died in\r\nAtchison county September 10, 1914. The elder Sutter had learned the\r\ntrade of carpenter in his youth and he plied his trade in St. Louis\r\nuntil 1857, when he came up the Missouri river by steamer to old Sumner,\r\nthen in the heyday of its brief glory and prosperity. He found plenty to\r\noccupy his talents at Sumner and helped to build a great many of the\r\nfirst houses there. It might be well to add here, however, that the\r\nfirst home of the family in Kansas was at old Port William, where one or\r\ntwo of the children were born. From Port William the family removed to\r\nSumner, and in the course of time Fred Sutter, Sr., made his home on a\r\nfarm in the northwestern part of Walnut township, near the Mt. Pleasant\r\nand Walnut line. The family lived there until the spring of 1880, during\r\nwhich time he worked at his trade. In 1880 he moved to Benton township,\r\nand for the first seven years of his residence there he rented the A. G.\r\nOtis farm, about two miles west of Effingham and then purchased the\r\nfarm. The next investment was made by his sons in the Osborn tract of\r\n480 acres of school land. Two years after buying this an additional\r\nquarter section was added, making 640 acres in all, which was owned by\r\nthis enterprising family. During all these years in which he was\r\naccumulating valuable farm lands, the elder Sutter had the assistance of\r\nhis sons, and the greater part of the estate is still tilled and owned\r\nby the children of this pioneer. Fred Sutter, Sr., came to this country\r\na poor man and worked in a planing mill and furniture factory at St.\r\nLouis until he heard of the opening of the Kansas territory, when he\r\ndetermined to be one of the first to settle in the new State. He was\r\nfarseeing, and by the practice of rigid economy and the better plan of\r\nholding his family together, was able to leave a considerable estate at\r\nhis demise. He was an honored and respected member of the community and\r\nwas well known throughout the county. The children born to Frederick and\r\nFredericka Sutter were as follows: Kate, deceased wife of H. W. Barkow,\r\nof the Kessler-Barkow Saddlery Company, of Atchison; Mrs. Augusta\r\nMcAdam, of Effingham; Fannie, housekeeper for her brother, William, who\r\nresides on the old home place; Mrs. Anna Shannon, of Effingham; Carl F.,\r\nof Kipp, Kan.; William and Fred, and Frank, on a farm one-half mile west\r\nof Effingham.\r\n\r\nFred Sutter, with whom this review is directly concerned, received his\r\neducation in the district schools, and for three years after his\r\nfather’s death lived on the home place, or until 1890. He settled on\r\npart of the family estate, consisting of 640 acres held jointly by the\r\nSutter sons, improving the property until his removal to Effingham,\r\nwhere he resided for three years, and then purchased his present farm,\r\nwhich is just at the edge of Effingham. He has 160 acres of fine land\r\nwithin sight of the town upon which he has erected (in 1909) one of the\r\nhandsomest, modern ten-room farm houses in the county. He also built a\r\nnew barn, 40×40 feet, which is in keeping with the rest of his farm\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutter was married May 20, 1908, to Sarah, daughter of Robert\r\nMcPhilimy, and to this union have been born the following children:\r\nMabel, aged five years, and Geneva, aged three years. He has been\r\nconnected with the Farmers and Merchants State Bank since 1905 and was\r\nelected president of this thriving financial institution in 1906. Mr.\r\nSutter is a Republican and is one of the wheel horses of the party in\r\nAtchison county. He was appointed a member of the Atchison County High\r\nSchool board in September of 1913, reëlected to the office in the fall\r\nof 1914 and is now serving as treasurer of this board. He is a member\r\nand trustee of the Presbyterian church of Effingham and is a liberal\r\ncontributor to the support of this religious denomination. He is\r\naffiliated fraternally with the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, the\r\nBenevolent and Protected Order of Elks of Atchison, and the Central\r\nProtective Association, being one of the original members of Effingham\r\nLodge, No. 158, Central Protective Association, and has been its\r\ntreasurer for the past four years.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Sutter is connected with the Presbyterian church of Effingham,\r\nhis ideal of a church for a small town is the community church which can\r\nbe used by the entire population of the town for public and social\r\npurposes. To this end he was the prime mover in the erection of the\r\nhandsome Presbyterian church building in Effingham, at a cost of\r\n$14,000, which was dedicated in June, 1913. This church building is used\r\nfor many public purposes and has been a decided benefit to Effingham in\r\nmany ways. Mr. Sutter started the movement for the building of this\r\nchurch and headed the subscription list, never desisting in his work\r\nuntil the church was erected and dedicated. Another monument to his\r\nenterprise is the farmers’ institute, with which he was connected for\r\nfive years and assisted materially in organizing. His energy and\r\ninfluence kept the institute going in fine shape for the five years with\r\nwhich he was connected with the movement. Mr. Sutter has a likable\r\npersonality and is one of the forceful and influential men of Atchison\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EDMOND W. ALLEN.\r\n\r\nEdmond W. Allen, merchant, of Muscotah, Kan., is a leading and\r\nsuccessful retailer of his city, and one of the hustling citizens of\r\nMuscotah. The grocery and meat market of which Mr. Allen is proprietor\r\nwas first established by Jacob P. Sprang, with whom Mr. Allen became a\r\npartner in 1902. He became the sole owner of the business in 1910.\r\nAllen’s store is nicely located in one of the large business rooms,\r\n80×25 feet in extent, on the main street of Muscotah, supplemented with\r\nan ice house and a ware house for feed and flour. In addition to\r\nconducting the grocery and meat market, Mr. Allen is a retailer of ice\r\nand conducts a produce exchange, which enabled him to ship eggs and\r\npoultry in considerable quantity to distant markets.\r\n\r\nEdmond W. Allen was born January 29, 1868, on a farm adjoining the\r\npresent county farm on the northwest corner, consisting of eighty acres,\r\nin Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison county. He was the son of M. L.\r\nDunlap and Amanda (Walker) Allen, natives of Kentucky. Amanda (Walker)\r\nAllen was the daughter of Philip Walker, who immigrated to Kansas from\r\nKentucky, settled on the prairies of Atchison county, but later moved to\r\nMissouri. M. L. Dunlap Allen moved from Kentucky to Missouri, and came\r\nfrom that State to Atchison county, Kansas, in 1863. He purchased the\r\nfarm of 130 acres on which he erected a small house, built out of native\r\nsawed lumber. In this house of two rooms several of his children were\r\nborn, and as the family increased in size, he added four rooms to the\r\nresidence. He was born in 1830, and died in March, 1886. He was the\r\nfather of eight children, as follows: Mrs. Francis J. Bucknum, of\r\nOklahoma City; Emily, deceased; William H., living at Saugatuck, Mich.;\r\nRobert M., former traveling salesman, who died at Holdredge, Neb., in\r\n1913; Edmond W., the subject of this review; Mrs. Etta M. Hubbard,\r\nliving in Michigan; Mrs. Addie Myrtle Latta, of Oklahoma City, and\r\nDudley M., deceased. The mother of these children died in 1881. The\r\nsenior Allen was again married in 1883 to Ruth Robinson, who now resides\r\nin Wyandotte county, near the town of Piper. One child, Ethel, was born\r\nof this marriage.\r\n\r\nEdmond W. Allen was reared on the pioneer farm of his father’s, near\r\nAtchison, Kan., and received his primary education in the district\r\nschools of his neighborhood, and completed his schooling at Beloit, Kan.\r\nWhen his father died, in 1886, William H. Allen, the oldest son, was\r\nappointed administrator of the estate, and guardian of the minor\r\nchildren. He removed all of them to his home at Beloit, where he was\r\nengaged in the implement business. This was done in order that William\r\nmight properly care for the younger children and look after their\r\neducation. Edmond W., after finishing his schooling, was employed for\r\ntwo years in his brother’s store at Beloit, following which he worked\r\nfor one year in a grocery store and meat market in Kansas City, Kan.,\r\nowned by Robert Robinson. His brother, William H., in the meantime, sold\r\nout his stock in Beloit and removed to Hoxie, Kan., and was employed in\r\na bank for a year and one-half. Financial disaster overtook the bank,\r\nand he then spent one year in Kansas City, Kan., after which, in 1891,\r\nhe went to western Nebraska and entered the employ of Harris Bros., a\r\nfirm of grain dealers with headquarters in Lincoln, Neb. Mr. Allen was\r\nlocated in the town of Stamford, Lebanon, and Republican City, Neb., in\r\nthe employ of Harris Bros. and was then transferred to the main office\r\nof the firm of Lincoln, Neb., where he remained until 1893. From 1893 to\r\n1895, he was in the employ of Hathaway & Williams, fire insurance\r\nagents, of Lincoln, and when this firm sold out he traveled for a period\r\nof six months in the interests of an Omaha fire insurance company. After\r\nhis marriage, in 1895, he resided in Michigan for one year, and in 1896\r\nhe again entered the employ of the Harris Bros. Grain Company, which\r\nfirm was later incorporated as the Central Granaries, a very rich\r\ncorporation. He remained with this concern until 1898, when he entered\r\nthe employ of the McCormick Harvester Company as bookkeeper, with\r\nheadquarters at Lincoln, Neb. He was in the employ of the McCormick\r\npeople until 1903. In the meantime he had formed a partnership with his\r\nfather-in-law, Jacob P. Sprang, in the grocery and meat market business\r\nin Muscotah, where Mr. Allen has resided permanently since 1903.\r\n\r\nEdmond W. Allen was married in 1895 to Miss Lucie Sprang, and their\r\nchildren are as follows: Una L., born in 1896, and is a senior in the\r\nfine arts and music department of Kansas University. Miss Una is a\r\nteacher of piano and violin, and has a large class of pupils. Mrs. Allen\r\nwas born on a farm in Benton township, Atchison county, five miles south\r\nof Effingham, and is a daughter of Jacob P. Sprang, who built up a fine\r\nfarm in Atchison county, and established the business which is now owned\r\nby Mr. Allen. While Mr. Allen is a Republican, he votes independently on\r\nlocal and county matters. He was formerly a member of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal church, but since coming to Muscotah has united with the\r\nCongregational church of this place. He is a member of the Knights and\r\nLadies of Security.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LUTHER CORTELYOU.\r\n\r\nFor a citizen of a small Kansas city to achieve State-wide prominence,\r\nand to become the official head of the body of mercantile men with whom\r\nhe became affiliated during a long and successful career, is somewhat\r\nout of the ordinary, and is decided evidence that the recipient of such\r\nhonors has received them solely because of pronounced ability of a high\r\norder. For several years, Luther Cortelyou, farmer, grain merchant, and\r\nbanker, of Muscotah, Kan., was the recognized leader among the grain men\r\nof Kansas, attaining to his position by virtue of executive ability and\r\npowers of leadership. He is one of the first and best known citizens of\r\nMuscotah and Atchison county, who for more than twenty-seven years has\r\nbeen active in civic affairs in the county.\r\n\r\nLuther Cortelyou was born December 23, 1851, in Somerset county, New\r\nJersey, and is a son of James G. and Cornelia (Polhemus) Cortelyou.\r\nJames Garretson Cortelyou, the father, was the son of Abraham Cortelyou,\r\nwho was descended from French Hugenot colonists, who first settled on\r\nLong Island in 1624. The original ancestor of the family fled from\r\nFrance to a safe refuge in Holland during the persecution of the\r\nHuguenots in France. Jaques Cortelyou was the founder of the family in\r\nAmerica and was prominent in the affairs of the colony on Long Island.\r\nHis son, Peter, was a governor of the borough in which is now located\r\nBrooklyn. The descendants of Jaques Cortelyou figured in Revolutionary\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nJames G. was reared in New Jersey, and there married Cornelia, a\r\ndaughter of C. Polhemus, also of an old Holland family. He was the\r\nfather of three children: John Gardner, deceased; Luther, of this\r\nreview; and Peter J., now deceased, formerly a resident of Corning,\r\nNemaha county, Kansas. The father died in Middlesex county, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nLuther Cortelyou was reared to young manhood on his father’s farm, and\r\nreceived his primary education in the public schools of Somerset county,\r\nNew Jersey. He received his academic education in Rutgers College, a\r\nDutch Reformed college, at New Brunswick, N. J., and then attended\r\nEastman’s Business College, at Poughkeepsie, N. Y. After his marriage he\r\nremoved to Maryland, where he lived on a farm which he purchased and\r\ncultivated for twelve years. In 1889 Mr. Cortelyou sold his Maryland\r\nproperty and came to Kansas and located in Muscotah, Atchison county. He\r\ninvested his capital in the M. J. Walsh grain elevator, and for eighteen\r\nyears was engaged in the buying and shipping of grain. He extended his\r\noperations, and owned an elevator at Corning, Kan., which he sold in\r\n1909. Mr. Cortelyou amassed a considerable competence during the many\r\nyears in which he was engaged in the grain business, and became\r\nprominent in mercantile circles in the State of Kansas. For seven years\r\nhe served as president of the Kansas Grain Dealers’ Association, and\r\ngained a wide acquaintance among grain dealers throughout the State and\r\nNation. He served for one year as second vice-president of the National\r\nGrain Dealers’ Association, and also filled the post of first vice-\r\npresident of the national body for one year. He disposed of his elevator\r\nin Muscotah in 1907, and has since retired from active business pursuits\r\nother than his farming and banking interests. Mr. Cortelyou is the owner\r\nof a fine farm of 250 acres in Grasshopper township, and was one of the\r\norganizers of the Farmers State Bank of Muscotah, of which thriving\r\ninstitution he is the president.\r\n\r\nMr. Cortelyou was first married in New Jersey in 1876 to Miss Gertrude\r\nStelle, of Middlesex county, New Jersey, and this union was blessed with\r\nfour children, namely: Luther, Jr., assistant cashier of the First\r\nNational Bank at Parsons, Kan., married Miss Lola Allison, a daughter of\r\nWebb Allison, of Nortonville, Kan.; Stelle, formerly an engineer in the\r\nUnited States Government service, died in Panama of yellow fever, in\r\n1905, at the age of twenty-two, having been the last victim to die from\r\nyellow fever on the Isthmus; Peter J., postmaster of Muscotah; Frank\r\nMorgan, born in 1886, a talented engineer, who was graduated from Kansas\r\nUniversity engineering department, and is connected with the engineering\r\nfirm of Waddell & Harrington, of Kansas City, Mo., and is now located in\r\nVancouver, Wash., in charge of the construction of an immense bridge\r\nacross the Columbia river, costing $1,750,000; this bridge connects\r\nVancouver, Wash., and Portland, Ore., and is a link in the Pacific\r\nhighway. It has twenty-nine steel-spans, and is over 17,200 feet in\r\nlength. The largest dredges and pile-driving machinery in the world are\r\nrequired in its construction. The permanent roadway of this great\r\nstructure is thirty-five feet wide with sidewalks five feet in width.\r\nFrank M. married Miss Marney Burney, of Green Forest, Ark. The mother of\r\nthese children was born March 19, 1856, in New Jersey, a daughter of\r\nPeter and Sarah J. Stelle, and she departed this life February 5, 1905.\r\nMr. Cortelyou was again married to Mrs. Alice T. Calvert, widow of J. H.\r\nCalvert, deceased merchant and banker of Muscotah, February 19, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party has always had the allegiance of Mr. Cortelyou, and\r\nhe has been prominently identified with the affairs of his party in\r\nAtchison county, and was the candidate of his party for county treasurer\r\nin 1896. He is a warm admirer of President Wilson and a supporter of the\r\nPresident’s policies. He was elected mayor of Muscotah in April, 1900,\r\nand served one term, and also has served as a member of the school board\r\nof Muscotah. Mr. Cortelyou is a member of the Congregational church of\r\nMuscotah, to which denomination he has been a liberal contributor: he\r\nassisted in the building of the church edifice, and has served as\r\ntrustee of the church for several years. For the past thirty years or\r\nmore he has been a member of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, and\r\nhe also is affiliated with the Modern Woodmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WILLIAM S. HUBBARD.\r\n\r\nLiving in comfortable retirement in Muscotah is one of the pioneer\r\nsettlers of Atchison county, who fought the good fight with grasshoppers\r\nand hot winds in the old days of hardships on the prairies over forty\r\nyears ago. William S. Hubbard is one of the fine old gentlemen of\r\nMuscotah who came to Kansas a poor man, has reared a fine family of\r\nprosperous sons and daughters, and achieved a competence sufficient to\r\nsupport him in comfort during his declining years.\r\n\r\nW. S. Hubbard was born March 10, 1839, on a farm near Cloverdale, Putnam\r\ncounty, Indiana, a son of Asa and Melinda (Holland) Hubbard, natives of\r\nKentucky, who founded a pioneer home in the forests of Putnam county,\r\nIndiana. Asa Hubbard, the father, died when William S. was a child, and\r\nhis mother married W. Davis. In 1844 the family moved to Illinois, where\r\nthe mother and stepfather died in later years. The Davis farm was\r\nlocated in Henry county, Illinois. Here W. S. was reared to young\r\nmanhood, and knew very few luxuries in those early days of privation and\r\nstruggle. After a two years’ residence on a farm near Burlington, Iowa,\r\nhe decided to come farther west to find a home and fortune where lands\r\nwere cheap and opportunities seemed to be much better than in Illinois.\r\nIn 1874 he set out with his wife and five children to find a home in\r\nAtchison county, Kansas. All of his worldly possessions consisted of a\r\nteam of horses, a cow, and twelve dollars in cash. His first year on a\r\nrented farm in Grasshopper township was a disastrous one, and the\r\n“hoppers” got his crops, even to a fine crop of cabbage, which he\r\nharvested and tried to cover up by piling hay upon the cabbages to keep\r\nthe greedy “hoppers” from eating them. Sad to relate, the grasshoppers\r\nburrowed down through the hay and ate the cabbage. The following year\r\nwas much better, Mr. Hubbard raising a fine crop of corn. During his\r\nfirst year he raised a good flax crop which he sold for one dollar and\r\nforty cents per bushel. He was eventually able to invest in 220 acres of\r\nrich bottom land, bordering the Delaware river, at a cost of fifteen\r\ndollars an acre. Mr. Hubbard had saved $800 to make the initial payment\r\non this tract, and in nine years succeeded in lifting the debt. During\r\nthe period in which he was paying off the indebtedness on his land he\r\nwas also paying interest on the money at the rate of ten per cent,\r\nannually. He sold his first farm some years after this and invested in\r\nthe fine tract of seventy-two acres which he now owns. On June 12, 1913,\r\nhe and Mrs. Hubbard decided that they had worked long enough, and left\r\nthe farm for a home in Muscotah.\r\n\r\nMr. Hubbard was married January 29, 1861, to Miss Mary Ann Pence, a\r\nnative of Lycoming county, Pennsylvania. Six children have been born to\r\nthis worthy couple, namely: William Elsworth, a farmer, of Kapioma\r\ntownship, Atchison county, and the owner of 160 acres of well improved\r\nfarm land; he married Mattie Roth, and they have six children: Lewis\r\nHenry Hubbard, a farmer of this county, owner of 160 acres of land: he\r\nmarried Ann Hinxton, and they have two children: Lillie Jane, wife of\r\nMalcolm Connor, residing on a homestead in South Dakota, and they have\r\nthree children: Cora May, wife of Simeon Routh, Atchison county; they\r\nhave six children. The other children are deceased. All of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nHubbard’s children are prosperous and highly respected citizens of their\r\nrespective communities, and are a credit and comfort to their aged\r\nparents, who are proud of the family. Mrs. Hubbard was born December 27,\r\n1839.\r\n\r\nFew people in Atchison county can point to a better record than Mr. and\r\nMrs. Hubbard, or can look back with greater satisfaction over long years\r\nwell spent in achieving a livelihood and rearing a fine family to\r\nmaturity. They came to Atchison county at a time when Indians still\r\nroamed the prairies, and very little of the prairie land was improved.\r\n\r\nMr. Hubbard is an old-line Democrat, and, while he has taken an active\r\ninterest in political affairs in his township and county, he has never\r\nbeen an aspirant for office, preferring to play the game for the pure\r\nlove and fun of it rather than to become an aspirant for political\r\nhonors. He and Mrs. Hubbard are members of the Second-Day Adventist\r\nchurch of Muscotah.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          O. O. BARKER, M. D.\r\n\r\nO. O. Barker, M. D., is one of the younger members of the medical\r\nprofession in Atchison county, located at Muscotah, Kan. During the nine\r\nyears which he has been located in Muscotah, he has built up an\r\nexcellent practice in his profession, and has demonstrated that he has\r\nan accurate knowledge of the art and science of medicine. Dr. Barker was\r\nborn March 30, 1885, in the town of True, Sumner county, West Virginia.\r\nHe is a son of J. Lee and Anna (Milburn) Barker, the former having been\r\nborn in 1860, and the latter in 1862, in Virginia. Both parents still\r\nreside at True, W. Va. J. Lee Barker was a son of M. Calloway Barker,\r\nalso a native of Virginia, and a descendant of an old Virginia family.\r\nThe history of the Barker family dates back to the birth of Chaplain\r\nBarker, of Liverpool, England, who was born in 1750, and immigrated to\r\nVirginia in 1785. David Barker, a son of Chaplain Barker, distiller, in\r\nRichmond, Va. William Barker, the son of David, was a tanner by trade,\r\nand had three sons: William A., Joseph, and Isaac. Of these sons, Joseph\r\nwas killed by Indians; Isaac lives at Liberty, Va., and reared the\r\nfollowing children: James M. Calloway, Mary E., A. L., Thomas J.,\r\nFrancis, and Joseph G. Thomas J. Barker immigrated to Kansas and became\r\na wealthy citizen of Kansas City, where he died. M. Calloway Barker\r\nlived at True, W. Va., and reared a family of twelve children: William\r\nA., who died in the Confederate service during the Civil war; Mary E.,\r\ndeceased; R. J., residing in Kansas City, Kan.; J. W., deceased; Thomas\r\nB., living near Hinton, W. Va.; James L., deceased; Dr. Joseph L.; J.\r\nLee, father of Dr. Barker; David M., of Parsons, Kan.: Francis I.;\r\nOllie, living at True, W. Va., and Maria, deceased. J. Lee Barker has\r\nalways been a farmer, and has made a success of his life’s vocation. He\r\nis one of the prominent and well known citizens of his section of West\r\nVirginia, and for several years has served as president of the school\r\nboard of True, W. Va. He has reared three children: Orus O., with whom\r\nthis review is directly concerned; Mrs. Grace M. Skaggs, Topeka, Kan.,\r\nand Mrs. Nellie B. Deeds, of Hinton, W. Va.\r\n\r\nDr. Barker received his primary education in the public schools of his\r\nnative town in West Virginia, and then decided to take up the study of\r\nmedicine. He studied for two years in the medical department in the\r\nUniversity of Maryland, and completed his medical education in the\r\nUniversity of Louisville, Ky., from which institution he received his\r\ndegree of Doctor of Medicine in 1906. After his graduation he came to\r\nKansas, visited for a few months with an uncle in Kansas City, Kan., and\r\nafter passing an examination given by the state board of medical\r\nexaminers of Topeka, he opened an office at Muscotah, Kan., October 1,\r\n1906. Dr. Barker is a member of the Northeast Kansas Medical Society,\r\nthe Kansas State Medical Association, and the Country Doctors’ Business\r\nand Social Club. He endeavors at all times to keep abreast of the latest\r\nadvancement in medical science, and has built up an excellent practice\r\nin Muscotah and the surrounding country. He was married June 2, 1906, to\r\nMiss Ethel M. Morton, a daughter of G. W. Morton, of Columbus, Ohio. Dr.\r\nBarker is a fraternal member of the Knights and Ladies of Security,\r\nModern Woodmen of America, and Mystic Workers of the World.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DR. CHARLES M. LUKENS.\r\n\r\nCharles M. Lukens, dentist, Muscotah, Kan., is a fine type of\r\nprofessional man who is self-made, and has achieved success in his\r\nprofession, which is gratifying and worthy of mention in a favorable\r\nmanner. Dr. Lukens was born June 28, 1872, in Harrison county, Ohio, and\r\nis a son of William Ellis and Margaret (McLaughlin) Lukens, both of whom\r\nwere born and reared in Ohio. William Ellis Lukens was born in 1849, and\r\nwas a son of Moses Lukens, born in Lycoming county, Pennsylvania, in\r\n1812, and was an uncompromising abolitionist. He was an early settler of\r\nHarrison county, Ohio, where he conducted a station on the famous\r\n“Underground Railway.” He lived to a great age, and it is a fact that\r\nlongevity is a characteristic of both the Lukens and the McLaughlin\r\nfamilies. The Lukens family was of Quaker origin, and the founder of the\r\nfamily in America was one of the original followers of William Penn.\r\nAnother characteristic of the Lukens family is the fact that a brother\r\nof William Ellis Lukens was a dentist, and Dr. Lukens has five cousins\r\nwho are practicing dentistry.\r\n\r\nWilliam Ellis Lukens migrated to Holt county, Missouri, in 1882, where\r\nhe resided for four years, and in 1886 he settled in Nemaha county. He\r\nwas one of the early pioneers in Nemaha county, and first engaged in the\r\nlive stock business at Corning, Kan., where he conducted a grain\r\nelevator, and bought and shipped live stock. He has become well-to-do,\r\nand is the owner of two large farms in Nemaha and Jackson counties. Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Lukens now make their home on a farm in Jackson county, Kansas,\r\nsouth of Netawaka. Their children are: Dr. C. M. Lukens, of Muscotah;\r\nChester W., a farmer, living south of Netawaka, and Kinney E., a farmer,\r\nliving in the northwest corner of Jackson county, Kansas. The mother of\r\nthese children was born in 1850.\r\n\r\nCharles M. Lukens received his primary education in the public schools\r\nof Corning, Kan., and then decided to work his way through college. His\r\nambition was to become a dentist, and for a period of five years he did\r\nall kinds of honest labor in order to pay for his tuition and expenses\r\nwhile attaining his collegiate education. He not only earned his way\r\nthrough college, but saved money in the meantime. He followed farming\r\nand railroad bridge work during this time, and eventually graduated from\r\nthe Western Dental College of Kansas City, Mo., on May 6, 1905. He\r\nlocated in Muscotah, June 29, 1905, and has made a signal success in the\r\npractice of his profession. Dr. Lukens also maintains an office at\r\nWhiting, Kan., and divides his time between the two towns, Whiting and\r\nMuscotah.\r\n\r\nDr. Lukens was married April 10, 1901, at Corning, Kan., to Miss Hallie\r\nA. Graham, a daughter of Dr. J. W. Graham, of Wetmore, Kan. They have\r\none child, Graham St. Clair Lukens, born June 21, 1902. The Republican\r\nparty claims the allegiance of Dr. Lukens, and he has always been active\r\nin political affairs in Atchison county, being one of the leaders and\r\n“wheel-horses” of the party in the county. He is affiliated with the\r\nAncient Free and Accepted Masons of Muscotah, and the Fraternal Order of\r\nEagles of Horton, Kan., and is a member of the Modern Woodmen. Dr.\r\nLukens is possessed of a likable and generous personality, which enables\r\nhim to make friends easily, and to retain them for all time. He is a\r\ngood provider for his family, and is fast accumulating a comfortable\r\ncompetence. He is a member in good standing of the Northeast Kansas\r\nDental Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JAMES M. TRIMBLE.\r\n\r\nJ. M. Trimble, deceased, was born September 10, 1843, in Buchanan\r\ncounty, Missouri, a son of Benjamin F. Trimble, a native of Kentucky and\r\nearly pioneer settler of De Kalb, Mo., where he conducted a blacksmith\r\nand wagon shop for a number of years, until his removal to Texas. After\r\nliving in Texas for some years, he finally located in Atchison county,\r\nKansas. James M. Trimble purchased a farm in this county and cultivated\r\nit until 1905 and then removed to Atchison and engaged in the livery\r\nbusiness, continuing the same until his demise in January of 1910. The\r\nfirst wife of James M. Trimble was Margaret McCreary, a daughter of\r\nSolomon McCreary, a pioneer settler of Atchison county. To this first\r\nmarriage were born the following children: J. P. Trimble; A. F. Trimble;\r\nK. S. Trimble; Ed. Henry; Roy C., sheriff of Atchison county, and T. O.\r\nTrimble.\r\n\r\nMr. Trimble was married the second time, to Mrs. Emma A. (Hayden)\r\nGallup, widow of Frank Gallup, January 21, 1892. She is a daughter of\r\nLevi and Martha Hayden, natives of Kentucky, and pioneer settlers of\r\nCoffey county, Kansas. The Hayden family were settlers in Coffey county,\r\nKansas, at a time when the county was largely populated by Indians. At\r\none time, while a resident of this county, Levi Hayden and a number of\r\nother settlers were hunting buffalo and were surrounded by hostile red-\r\nmen, who robbed the hunting party of their provisions and horses and\r\nleft the hunters on the plains destitute. A terrible snow storm came up,\r\nand several of the party perished from cold and starvation, Mr. Hayden\r\nbeing among the number lost. After his death his widow reared the family\r\nof seven children with the exception of two sons and a daughter, Emma,\r\nwho went to reside with an uncle, John Hayden, in Iowa. This uncle was a\r\nvery prominent resident of Taylor county, Iowa, and served as county\r\nclerk and county surveyor. He ran a survey line from his farm in Taylor\r\ncounty, Iowa, to a place later named Hayden Junction, near Council\r\nBluffs. He was a school teacher and a man of more than ordinary ability\r\nand reared his adopted children to become good citizens. Emma lived at\r\nher uncle’s home until January 1, 1874, and while attending high school\r\nat Bedford, Iowa, she met Frank Gallup, whom she married. Mr. Gallup\r\ndied August 11, 1888. To this union were born children as follows:\r\nNellie M., wife of Gale Trimble, of Atchison county; Jennie B. married\r\nEdwin E. Buchanan, now deceased, and she lives in Atchison; Clara Maude,\r\nwife of Ed. Trimble, residing near Seattle, Wash.; Samuel D., of\r\nAtchison; Agnes Gertrude, wife of Blake Balaock, of Memphis, Tenn.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the marriage of Mr. Trimble and Mrs. Gallup, Mr. Trimble\r\nwas serving as superintendent of the Atchison county poor farm. They had\r\ncharge of this institution for over six years and then moved to Mr.\r\nTrimble’s farm, which is now owned by John M. Price, in Mt. Pleasant\r\ntownship. They resided on the farm until their removal to Atchison in\r\n1905. After another short period of residence on the farm they finally\r\npurchased the property which is the family home at 1206 South Seventh\r\nstreet, Atchison. Mr. Trimble conducted a livery and horse trading\r\nbusiness in Atchison until his demise. He dealt extensively in horses\r\nand cattle, and frequently conducted farm and real estate deals to\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nJames M. Trimble was a life-long Republican and took an active and\r\ninfluential part in the affairs of his party. He was well and favorably\r\nknown throughout Atchison county. He and Mrs. Trimble were affiliated\r\nwith the Presbyterian church, and Mr. Trimble belonged to the Grand Army\r\nof the Republic by virtue of having enlisted for service in a Kansas\r\nregiment during the Civil war, at the time of the Price invasion. It can\r\nbe said of him that he was an honest, upright citizen, who cared well\r\nfor those who depended upon him and he was, according to those who knew\r\nhim best, a good man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         JOHN EDWARD SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\nFor fifty-five years John Edward Sullivan has resided in Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas, and can be readily classed with the old-timers of the\r\ncounty. His parents came from Iowa to Kansas when he was but one year\r\nold, and his father, with the assistance of his sons, Roger P. and John\r\nEdward, was enabled to rise from poverty to become the owner of half a\r\nsection of land in Grasshopper township. The account of this family is\r\nsimilar to that of several other prosperous Irish families in Atchison\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nJohn E. Sullivan was born May 15, 1859, in Keokuk, Iowa, a son of\r\nMichael and Bridget (Tobin) Sullivan, both of whom were born in Ireland.\r\nMichael Sullivan was born in 1826 in Ireland, and lived in his native\r\nland until he was twelve years of age, and then made his way, alone and\r\nunaided, to America. His travels for seeking fortune in the new country\r\ntook him ever onward, and he was married in Keokuk, Iowa, to Bridget\r\nTobin, who was his faithful helpmeet when he was rising from poverty to\r\naffluence. Mr. Sullivan came to Atchison, Kan., in 1860, and for some\r\ntime was engaged in the railroad contract work, and assisted in the\r\ngrading of the Central Branch railroad. With the money saved in his\r\nrailroad contract work he became the owner of a home in Atchison, which\r\nhe exchanged for eighty acres of land in Grasshopper township, upon\r\nwhich he settled and soon developed into a fine farm. Mr. Sullivan, in\r\nthe course of a few years, was enabled to buy an additional quarter\r\nsection, and with the help of his sturdy sons, he increased his holdings\r\nto 320 acres of well improved farm land. When old age crept upon Michael\r\nSullivan and his wife they turned the farm over to their two sons, who\r\ncared for them in their declining years, which were spent in peace and\r\ncomfort. Mr. Sullivan died at the home of his son, John Edward, December\r\n24, 1904. He was the father of three children: John Edward, the subject\r\nof this review; Roger Patrick, a prosperous farmer of Benton township,\r\nAtchison county, and Mary, deceased.\r\n\r\nJohn Edward Sullivan attended the public schools of Atchison until he\r\nwas fourteen years of age, and after his parents removed to the farm in\r\nGrasshopper township he remained at home and assisted his father on the\r\nhome farm until he was thirty years old. He then purchased his present\r\nfarm of 160 acres, made improvements upon it, and has brought the land\r\nup to a high state of cultivation. Mr. Sullivan has his farm stocked\r\nwith well graded horses and cattle, and has frequently exhibited his\r\nfine draft colts and mules at the county fairs, held at Effingham, Kan.\r\n\r\nMr. Sullivan was married in 1890 to Anna Small, and to this union were\r\nborn eight children, namely: Mary E., deceased: Anna, John, Lauretta,\r\nLeo, and Lucy, all at home with their parents; Grace, deceased; one\r\nchild died in infancy. Mrs. Sullivan was born October 29, 1864, in\r\nIreland, a daughter of Patrick and Elizabeth (McVay) Small, who\r\nimmigrated to America, settling in Pennsylvania, and came to Atchison,\r\nKan., in 1879; they were engaged in farming for some years, and are now\r\nliving at Effingham, Kan. Mrs. Sullivan died November 23, 1906. She was\r\na well educated woman, being an accomplished musician and a teacher of\r\nmusic. Mr. Sullivan is a stockholder and director of the Farmers State\r\nBank of Muscotah. He is not allied with any political parties, and casts\r\nhis vote independently at election time for the candidates of his\r\nchoice, who seem best fitted to perform the duties of the office sought.\r\nHe is a member of the Catholic church, and is fraternally allied with\r\nthe Knights of Columbus of Atchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RIENZI M. DUNLAP.\r\n\r\nRienzi M. Dunlap, editor and publisher of the _Muscotah Record_,\r\nMuscotah, Kan., was born in Illinois, February 25, 1850. He is the son\r\nof John M. and Nancy (Fletcher) Dunlap, the former a native of Maine,\r\nand the latter a native of Illinois. John M. Dunlap was a descendant\r\nfrom Scotch-Irish ancestry, who immigrated from North of Ireland to\r\nAmerica. His wife was of English descent, and a daughter of Kentucky\r\nparents, who emigrated from Kentucky to Illinois in the early days. John\r\nM. received his education in his native State, and was engaged in\r\nteaching school, a profession which he followed for twenty-five years.\r\nHe taught school in Illinois, southern Wisconsin, and also in the State\r\nof Iowa. He finally located on a farm in northern Iowa, near Nashua,\r\nwhich he developed into a fine productive plant. He became well known as\r\na skilled horticulturist, and originated several different kinds of\r\nfruits. He died at his home near Nashua, Iowa, in 1909. His widow still\r\nlives on the home place.\r\n\r\nRienzi M. Dunlap was educated in the schools of northeastern Iowa, and\r\nentered college with the intention of completing a college course, but\r\nhis eyesight failing him, he was unable to complete his classical\r\nstudies. Later, he prepared himself for the teaching profession by self-\r\nstudy, and received a teacher’s certificate. He taught school for\r\nfifteen years at various places in Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota. The\r\nlast five years of his teaching was of a professional character, with\r\nthe backing of a professional certificate. During all this time he had\r\nbeen preparing himself by hard study to enter the ministry, and on\r\nSeptember 1, 1893, went to Wisconsin and began preaching in an Advent\r\nChristian church. He preached for four years in Wisconsin in the\r\ninterest of the Advent Christian denomination, and later engaged in the\r\nmarket gardening business for the benefit of his health at Baraboo,\r\nWis., where he resided until 1909, in the meantime preaching in the\r\nchurches of the nearby towns. From 1909 until 1910 he had charge of a\r\nchurch at Linn, Kan. Mr. Dunlap, while engaged in teaching, managed to\r\nobtain considerable journalistic experience by working in various\r\nnewspaper offices, among them being that of his uncle. Consequently, it\r\nis not surprising that in 1910 he came to Muscotah, Kan., and purchased\r\nthe _Muscotah Record_. He is operating an excellent newspaper, which is\r\nnoted for its clean, moral and fearless stand on all public questions.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunlap was married at Mendota, Ill., August 23, 1893, to Miss Retta\r\nMorris, of Ohio, who was also a public school teacher, who taught school\r\nfifteen terms previous to her marriage, several years of which were in\r\nIowa. Mr. and Mrs. Dunlap are the parents of three children: Morris O.,\r\na student of journalism in the Advent Christian College, Aurora, Ill.,\r\nwhich course is to be followed by two years in the university; Ella M.,\r\na pupil in the eighth grade in the Muscotah school; Mary, a pupil in the\r\nsixth grade in the public school. Mr. Dunlap is an independent in\r\npolitics, who has not allied himself in any form of politics, and\r\nbelieves that the best government results from the independent voting of\r\nits citizens. His newspaper is also noted for its independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LEWIS P. Du BOIS.\r\n\r\nLewis P. Du Bois has the distinction of being the oldest living pioneer\r\nsettler of Atchison county residing in Shannon township. The story of\r\nhis life since coming to the great West in search of health reads like a\r\nromance and is well worth recounting in the pages of this history of the\r\ncounty which he has helped to create during the past fifty-seven years\r\nor more. The last days of his eventful life are being peacefully spent\r\nin the beautiful country home which he erected several years ago, which\r\nsets far back in a park created by his own hands and shaded by great\r\ntrees planted in years gone by on the barren prairie which he broke and\r\nbrought to a high state of cultivation. Mr. Du Bois can look out over\r\nthe broad acres which he and his good and faithful wife have\r\naccumulated, and be well content that providence has been kind to them\r\nand theirs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Du Bois—Golden Wedding Anniversary.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLewis P. Du Bois is a descendant of an old American family. He was born\r\nMarch 23, 1834, in Salem county, New Jersey, a son of Samuel and Mary\r\n(Johnson) Du Bois, both of whom were natives of New Jersey. Louis Du\r\nBois, a Frenchman, who came to America in about 1660, and established\r\nthe French settlement of New Palz, was the original founder of the\r\nfamily in this country. His children were as follows: Jacob, Abraham,\r\nSarah, Isaac, David, Solomon, Rebecca, Rachel and Matthew. Samuel Du\r\nBois was the son of Matthew, a great-grandson of the first Louis Du\r\nBois. Lewis Du Bois, direct ancestor of Lewis, and son of Mathias, was a\r\nsoldier in the Revolution and served for seven years under General\r\nWashington, and was engaged in all of the battles in which Washington’s\r\narmy participated. Matthias’ children were: Sarah, Lewis, Anna, Rachel,\r\nCornelius, Matthew and Benjamin. Lewis Du Bois, the Revolutionary\r\npatriot, married Rebekah Craig and was the father of the following\r\nchildren: John, Matthew, Polly, Lewis, Rebekah, Benjamin, Elizabeth, and\r\nSamuel, father of the subject of this review. Samuel Du Bois was born\r\nSeptember 26, 1800, and died in May, 1873. He married Mary Johnson, who\r\nwas born January 17, 1824, and died January 28, 1879.\r\n\r\nTo Samuel and Mary Du Bois were born children as follows: Rebecca, who\r\nbecame the wife of Clarence Struper, and is now-deceased; Adaline, wife\r\nof Jacob Kaeley, deceased; Mary Jane, wife of John Du Bois, of\r\nFairfield, Iowa; Lewis, with whom this review is directly concerned;\r\nEmeline, wife of Daniel Hitchner, Nemaha county, Kansas; Eliza, wife of\r\nA. Hitchner, deceased; Samuel Johnson, Salem county, New Jersey. Mr. Du\r\nBois has an old Bible over 150 years old and also has in his possession\r\ngenealogical works concerning the Du Bois, Patterson and the Ewing\r\nfamilies which can be consulted for further genealogical data if need\r\nbe. Samuel Du Bois was a farmer and his father, Lewis, was a paymaster\r\nin the American army of defense during the War of 1812. Both lived and\r\ndied on the old ancestral farm which has been in the family for many\r\ngenerations. Lewis donated one farm of 160 acres to the Daretown\r\nPresbyterian church and practically endowed it. Samuel was a very\r\nprominent citizen in his neighborhood and held several important offices\r\nand was one of the twelve free holders of Salem county, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nLewis P. Du Bois was educated in the common schools of his native county\r\nand when twenty years of age was employed as clerk in a store at\r\nBridgeton, Cumberland county, New Jersey, for three years, after which\r\nhe spent one year assisting his father farm the old homestead. His\r\nhealth failing, he was told by the family doctor that he must go west or\r\nhe could live but a short time. Leaving the old home, his sweetheart and\r\nall associations behind him, he set out and arrived in Atchison in\r\nApril, 1858, with only $50 in cash in his pockets. For the first year he\r\nmade his home with Dr. Challiss, on the doctor’s farm. Dr. Challiss\r\nadvised him to spend one year near the river and then go to the\r\nmountains for an indefinite stay until he was cured. At the end of his\r\nfirst year’s residence in the West he set out for the mountain country\r\nas assistant to Eli Mason, the first sheriff of Atchison county, in the\r\nconduct of a wagon train en route to Ft. Kearney. His first trip to the\r\nWest and the outdoor life proved beneficial and upon his return he\r\nclerked in the store of P. R. King until November of 1859, and again\r\ncrossed the plains with Henry Macey, of Weston, Mo. This was a very hard\r\nand long trip, taken in the winter time, but he gained rapidly in\r\nstrength and general health and accumulated weight until he tipped the\r\nscales at 158 pounds. Upon his arrival in Denver, Colo., the mining\r\nexcitement was at its height and he was seized with the gold fever. He\r\ntook up a mining claim in the mountains, but left it and went further\r\ninto the mountainous country. He spent all of his money on developing\r\nanother claim, building a sluice and dam and turning the course of a\r\nstream in order to get a sufficient flow of water for placer mining. All\r\nof his efforts came to naught and his mining fixtures were washed away\r\nby a disastrous flood and he was left in debt over $1,000. He and his\r\nassociates then went to Georgia gulch and bought another claim which\r\nyielded sufficiently to enable him to pay off his debts and then the\r\ngold gave out entirely. News came to the camp during his first winter in\r\nthe mountains that a number of men were snow bound over the divide and\r\nwere starving for food. The snow was from seven to ten feet deep on the\r\nlevel and twenty feet deep on the ranges. Mr. Du Bois and another man\r\nwere the only men brave enough to volunteer to carry succor to the\r\ndestitute prospectors and had the distinction of being the first men to\r\ncross the Rockies in the dead of winter. From Colorado he went to\r\nWyoming and then returned to Atchison in 1861, meeting the fast pony\r\nexpress on his way and learning of Abraham Lincoln’s election to the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nFrom Atchison he returned to the old home in New Jersey and there\r\nmarried the sweetheart who had been waiting for him to come back,\r\nrestored to vigorous health and strength. He followed farming in New\r\nJersey for three years, suffering in the meantime from rheumatism and\r\nsickness, brought on from too much exposure to the elements. In 1865 he\r\nand his wife again returned to Atchison with a cash capital of $500 and\r\nhe took charge of a farm owned by his friend, Dr. Challiss, on the share\r\nplan for a period of three years. His farming experience for those three\r\nyears was not at all profitable, and he was left at the end of the time\r\nwith practically no funds. Jayhawkers took practically all that he made,\r\nand one time, after he had fattened a lot of hogs on corn which cost him\r\n$1.10 per bushel, thieves stole the porkers and he was left without a\r\ndollar. He then ventured to sell fruit trees to the settlers in Colorado\r\non the route to Denver and was very successful in taking many orders.\r\nThe delivery of this consignment consisting of two wagon loads cost over\r\n$1,850 by overland freight train in the fall of the year. The Indians\r\nwere troublesome at the time and during one eventful night which\r\ndemonstrated that the biggest braggarts with the train were the greatest\r\ncowards, the Indians tried to run off their mules but were finally\r\ndriven off. This venture resulted in replenishing his store of funds and\r\nhe bought his first farm with the proceeds, paying cash for it. Like\r\nmany others during those early days, Mr. Du Bois herded cattle on the\r\ngreat free ranges but was unfortunate in having fifty head die of Texas\r\nfever contracted from an infected herd of Texas cattle which were being\r\npastured over the range on the way to market. Many, indeed, were the\r\ndiscouragements which beset his attempts to secure a livelihood, at one\r\ntime having purchased a horse from a Mr. Galbreath, it developed that\r\nthe beast was afflicted with glanders in a contagious form. This\r\nnecessitated the killing of all of his horses and the consequent\r\nrestocking of his farm. Prosperity eventually smiled upon him and his,\r\nhowever, and better times came and he became the owner of 320 acres of\r\nexceedingly fine land in Shannon township. He is a director of the Bank\r\nof Vliets, Kan.\r\n\r\nMr. Du Bois was married November 3, 1863, to Sarah Jane Jones and to\r\nthis union have been born children as follows: Mrs. Carrie C. Buck, born\r\nin 1865, and residing at Vliets, Kan.; Lewis P. died in infancy; Samuel\r\nT., born July 7, 1876, operates the home farm, married Anna Katharine\r\nKistler, daughter of William D. Kistler, and has two children, Lewis P.,\r\nJr., and Kathryn Ellen. The mother of these children was born April 5,\r\n1835, in Salem county, New Jersey, daughter of Joseph and Mary Ann (Van\r\nMeter) Jones. The Jones family of which she is a descendant is a very\r\nold one in America, and a history of the family is being now published.\r\nThe Van Meter family had its origin in this country as far back as 1660\r\nand they were members of the new Palz settlement in New Jersey. Her\r\ngrandfather, Samuel Van Meter, married Lady Anna Bishop, a titled\r\nEnglish lady who was a member of a noble English family. Several of her\r\nancestors served in the war of independence.\r\n\r\nOn November 3, 1913, there was celebrated at the hospitable and\r\nbeautiful Du Bois home, the fiftieth or golden wedding anniversary of\r\nthis widely known and well loved pioneer couple. Guests to the number of\r\n500 came to congratulate them from far and near, among them being the\r\nnotable men and women of Atchison county, who are proud of the\r\nfriendship of Mr. and Mrs. Du Bois. The tables groaned with good things\r\nto eat and the day was spent happily in merrymaking, the wedding\r\nceremony of Lewis and Sarah being again duplicated for the edification\r\nof the interested guests. No invitations were issued for the occasion,\r\nbut a general country-wide notice printed in the Atchison newspapers\r\ncaused a perfect hegira to the Du Bois home of old and new friends of\r\nthis worthy couple, who wished to be in line to grasp their hands and\r\nwish them many more happy years of wedded life which have been unmarred\r\nby a single serious discord. The fifty-three years of wedded life have\r\nbeen replete with happiness and blessings for Mr. and Mrs. Du Bois, in\r\nthe main, while tinged with sorrows which are the inevitable lot of all\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nMr. Du Bois and the members of his family are affiliated with the\r\nPresbyterian church. He is a member of the Masonic lodge, the\r\nIndependent Order of Odd Fellows and the Central Protective Association,\r\nhaving been one of the founders of the Good Intent lodge of the Central\r\nProtective Association. He has been a life-long Democrat, and, while\r\nnever having sought political preferment and not having filled any\r\noffice but that of trustee of Shannon township, he has always taken in\r\nother years a very active part in county, State and National politics.\r\nHe was a great personal friend of Governor Glick.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          EDWIN S. WOODWORTH.\r\n\r\nThe name Woodworth is a noted one, not only in Kansas, but in American\r\nhistory. A long line of distinguished men have descended from the\r\noriginal founders of the family in America, and the men of each\r\nsuccessive generation have added additional luster to the family name by\r\ndeeds of valor and statesmanship which stand out prominently in the\r\nannals of their respective abiding places. Edwin S. Woodworth, farmer\r\nand live stock breeder, of Kapioma township, is a well and favorably\r\nknown member of the civic body of Atchison county, and a son of Maj.\r\nCaleb A. Woodworth, who was one of the famous figures in the early\r\nperiod of the making Kansas into a great State. His grandfather, Caleb\r\nA. Woodworth, Sr., was one of the earliest of the Kansas pioneers.\r\n\r\nMajor Caleb A. Woodworth was born in Wilkesbarre, Pa., April 14, 1838,\r\nand was a son of Caleb Woodworth, a native of Tyre, N. Y., whose father,\r\nalso named Caleb, was a captain of artillery under General Scott in the\r\nWar of 1812. Gresham Woodworth, the great-grandfather of Major\r\nWoodworth, was a colonel in the Continental army during the American\r\nRevolution, and fought at the battle of Saratoga. The Woodworth family\r\nis of English origin, the progenitors of the family having emigrated\r\nfrom the Isle of Man early in the seventeenth century. The father of\r\nMajor Woodworth was a farmer by occupation, and married Miss Ellen\r\nGordon, of Goshen, N. Y., a cousin of Gen. Gordon, of Goshen, and a\r\ndaughter of Cornelius Gordon, who was born in Ireland, of Scotch-Irish\r\nparents, and settled in Virginia. The elder Woodworth died at the age of\r\nseventy-four years, and the wife and mother died in December, 1898, at\r\nthe age of eighty-six years. Caleb, Sr., immigrated to Kansas in 1857,\r\nand settled at Muscotah, Atchison county. Both Caleb Woodworth and his\r\nwife were members of the Congregational church, and Caleb was an Odd\r\nFellow. He was well educated, and in his younger days was a school\r\nteacher, becoming a farmer in later life. The line of Woodworths in\r\nAmerica tells of many men of letters and distinction, and many soldiers\r\nwho have shed luster on the family name in the successive generations.\r\n\r\nThere were five children born to Caleb, Sr., and wife, namely: Caleb A.,\r\nfather of Edwin S.; Gilbert M., who came to Kansas at an early day, and\r\nserved three years in a Kansas regiment during the Civil war, first as\r\ncorporal, then as sergeant, and later was captain of a company of the\r\nFourth Arkansas infantry, and was made lieutenant-colonel of the Twelfth\r\nKansas militia in 1864. He became prominent in political life, and\r\nserved as State senator in Colorado, and died while marching in the G.\r\nA. R. reunion parade in Philadelphia, September 8, 1899; eighty veterans\r\nsuccumbed to the heat. He left one son, Charles G., of Onanga, Okla.;\r\nBen F., a resident of Downs, Okla., served three years in the Union\r\narmy, part of the time as bugler of Company A, Fifth regiment, Kansas\r\ninfantry, and later as captain in the Fourth Kansas regiment; David G.,\r\na graduate of Monroe Institute, a teacher, and a Kansas militiaman.\r\nDavid Woodworth assisted in the survey of Oklahoma, moved to the new\r\nState in 1889, and settled at Downs. He was a successful farmer, but is\r\nnow postmaster at Kingfisher, Okla. The mother accompanied him to\r\nOklahoma, and died there; Sarah Elizabeth, deceased, was the wife of B.\r\nA. Colville, and left one son, Dr. Frank Colville, who died in St.\r\nJoseph, Mo.\r\n\r\nMajor Caleb A. Woodworth came to Kansas in 1857, from Virginia, and\r\nengaged in farming near Muscotah until 1859, when he entered the\r\nUniversity of Chicago, and pursued his collegiate education until the\r\noutbreak of the Civil war. He then returned to Kansas and offered his\r\nservices in defense of the Union. His first enlistment was for a period\r\nof nine months in Company B, Fourth regiment, Kansas infantry. He then\r\nassisted in organizing the Thirteenth Kansas regiment, and was a member\r\nof Company F of that regiment, which he joined September 20, 1862. He\r\nrose rapidly in rank, was commissioned major of his regiment, and served\r\nfor three years, or until the close of the war. He served directly under\r\nColonel Bowen, and under Generals Blount, Schofield, Steele, and\r\nReynolds. He participated in the battles around Springfield, Mo., and in\r\nArkansas. At the battle of Prairie Grove, in 1862, his horse was shot\r\nfrom under him. Three times his mount was killed in battle, but he\r\nseemed to bear a charmed life, and was never wounded. After the close of\r\nthe war he returned to Atchison, Kan., and engaged in freighting across\r\nthe plains, making three trips in all with a freighting outfit. He was\r\nthe first man to telegraph money from Denver, Colo., to Atchison. He\r\noperated a livery barn where the union depot now stands in Atchison.\r\nAbout 1868 he again turned his attention to farming, and settled in\r\nKapioma township, where his father had preëmpted half a section of land.\r\nMajor Woodworth farmed the home tract, and erected the house where Edwin\r\nS. now lives. He became an extensive cattle feeder, and was very\r\nsuccessful in his farming operations.\r\n\r\nMajor Woodworth was married in June, 1867, to Miss Margaret Shaw, of\r\nValley Falls, Kan. Three children were born of this union, namely: Nora,\r\nwife of E. M. Wilcox, Kamaloops, British Columbia; Edwin S.; Jennie,\r\nliving in Wood, S. D. The mother of these children was born in Akron,\r\nOhio, January 21, 1850, a daughter of William and Louise (Fletcher)\r\nShaw, natives of Ohio. She is now residing with her daughter at Wood, S.\r\nD.\r\n\r\nThe civic and political career of Major Woodworth was a distinguished\r\none. He was elected State senator from Atchison county on the Republican\r\nticket in 1876, and served for four years. During his term as senator he\r\nwrote the bill and presented the same to the State legislature,\r\norganizing the Kansas State Historical Society. In 1892 he was chosen to\r\nrepresent the third district in the lower house of the legislature, this\r\ntime being elected on the Democratic ticket. In 1895 he removed to\r\nEffingham, Kan., and resided in that city until 1897, when he removed to\r\nAtchison to take up his duties as superintendent of the State Soldiers’\r\nOrphans’ Home. He filled the duties of this position until 1900, when he\r\nresigned and retired to a home in Muscotah, Kan. Major Woodworth died\r\nOctober 24, 1908. His demise marked the passing of one of the most noted\r\nof the Kansas pioneers, a distinguished soldier and statesman. He left a\r\nheritage of honorable and upright service to the people of the State, of\r\nwhich his descendants can well be proud.\r\n\r\nEdwin S. Woodworth was born April 20, 1874, on the farm where he now\r\nresides. He was educated in the common schools of his native county, and\r\nstudied in Bolton University, after completing a course in the high\r\nschool at Effingham, Kan. After his marriage, in 1895, he began farming\r\nthe home place of the Woodworth family. He is the owner of 163 acres of\r\nrich farm land, which is well improved. Mr. Woodworth is a well known\r\nbreeder of registered Shorthorn cattle, and ships the product of his\r\nfarm in this respect to all parts of the country. He is a member of the\r\nAmerican Shorthorn Breeders’ Association. During 1915 he had a herd of\r\nfifty thoroughbred Shorthorns, but has sold to buyers at excellent\r\nprices until he has depleted his herd.\r\n\r\nMr. Woodworth was married May 29, 1895, to Miss Sadie E. Speer, born\r\nJune 11, 1875, and reared on a farm three miles east of Muscotah. (See\r\nbiography of D. Anna Speer for details concerning the Speer family.)\r\nFour children have been born to Edwin S. and Sadie E. Woodworth, namely:\r\nMrs. Marguerite Mulligan, of Benton township; Mabel, a student in the\r\ncounty high school at Effingham; Isabelle and Mildred, at home.\r\n\r\nPolitically, Mr. Woodworth is allied with the Democratic party. He\r\nattends the Methodist Episcopal church, and is affiliated with the\r\nKnights of Pythias, the Modern Woodmen of America and the Central\r\nProtective Association. There is no doubt in the minds of those who know\r\nMr. Woodworth and esteem him for his many excellent qualities, that he\r\nwill keep alive the traditions of the Woodworth family and endeavor to\r\nfollow in the footsteps of his illustrious ancestors as regards right\r\nliving and doing his duty to his county and State.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HAL C. LOW.\r\n\r\nHal C. Low, of the firm of Johnson-Low Clothing Company, of Atchison,\r\nwas born in 1879 in Doniphan county, Kansas. His parents were J. W. and\r\nMary (Collins) Low, natives of the Buckeye State, the father’s home\r\nhaving been at West Milton, Ohio. The grandfather of Hal C. was Ansel\r\nLow, who was one of the earliest pioneer settlers of Kansas, first\r\ncoming to Atchison in 1852, following which he located in Doniphan,\r\nwhere he kept the first hotel, or tavern, and also operated a general\r\nstore. To the home of this pioneer came in the fall of 1860, Abraham\r\nLincoln, who was then touring the country in his first campaign for the\r\npresidency. Lincoln’s visit and stay at the Low hostelry was an event\r\nwhich awakened a great deal of pride with J. W. Low and he was fond of\r\nrelating the circumstance and describing in detail how Mrs. Low served\r\nthe simple wants of the greatest of all Americans. He was always a\r\nstanch supporter of the martyred President and gave direct evidence of\r\nhis loyalty to the Union by his enlistment in Company I, Seventh\r\nregiment, Kansas cavalry, serving under Generals Rosecrans and Grant\r\nsuccessively, and was in active service throughout the entire war.\r\n\r\nHal C. Low was educated in the common and high schools of Atchison, and\r\nthen entered his father’s dry goods store, where he spent several years\r\nprofitably, absorbing the details of the business and in becoming a\r\nproficient salesman and buyer. This experience stood him in good stead,\r\nand in 1905 he organized the Johnson-Low Clothing Company and has made\r\nan unqualified success of the venture. The store is one of the most\r\ncomplete in this section of the State, and carries high grade goods of\r\nthe best workmanship and design. The ever increasing trade, which flows\r\nto this establishment, is the best evidence of its continued success.\r\n\r\nMr. Low was married in 1905 to Miss Jane Pollock, daughter of S. M.\r\nPollock, an early pioneer settler of Iowa, later a resident of Kansas,\r\nand now residing in Atchison. Mr. Low is a Republican.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             D. ANNA SPEER.\r\n\r\nThe public owes much to the teachers who have made a life work of their\r\nchosen profession. While the teaching profession is used to some extent\r\nas a stepping-stone to something supposedly higher and better, or as an\r\nopportunity on the part of young people to earn some money in\r\npreparation for embarking in some other vocation, there are in the ranks\r\nof the profession a considerable number of efficient and painstaking\r\neducators who through a deep and abiding love of the work of teaching\r\nthe youth of the land and a desire to advance themselves high in their\r\nprofession, have made themselves indispensable members of the community,\r\nand have shown by application and actual practice that they are fitted\r\nabove the rank and file to hold executive positions. D. Anna Speer,\r\ncounty superintendent of schools for Atchison county, is a capable and\r\nsuccessful educator whose marked ability has received due recognition\r\nfrom the people of the community in which she was reared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Miss D. Anna Speer._\r\n]\r\n\r\nShe was born in Atchison county, a daughter of Joseph and Mary\r\n(Fountain) Speer. Her father, Joseph Speer, was born March 4, 1834, in\r\nLeesville, Ind., and was the son of Andrew and Dicie (Kirby) Speer, both\r\nnatives of Kentucky. Miss Speer’s mother was a daughter of Stephen\r\nFountain and Mary (Clark) Fountain, natives of North Carolina. The\r\nancestors on the side of each parent were pre-Revolutionary colonists of\r\nVirginia and the Carolinas. The Speers were among the earliest settlers\r\nof Kentucky and the great-great-grandfather of Miss Speer on the\r\nmaternal side was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Joseph\r\nand Mary Speer were married in Indiana and came west in 1859, settling\r\non a farm near Muscotah in the spring of 1860. Mr. Speer invested in a\r\npartly improved farm of 160 acres on which they lived until old age\r\nrequired that they leave the farm for a town home in Muscotah. During\r\nthe Civil war Mr. Speer served in the Kansas State militia and took part\r\nin the expedition against the Price invasion. Joseph Speer died March 5,\r\n1900. His wife was born in September, 1833, and departed this life June\r\n19, 1909. To them were born six sons and three daughters: William F.,\r\nwho resides on the home farm; Mrs. Mary J. Long, of Fowler, Kan.;\r\nAndrew, present county commissioner and farmer residing near Muscotah;\r\nJames R., one of the pioneer settlers of Guthrie, Okla.; John W., a\r\nfarmer of Morrison, Okla.; George T., a resident of Guthrie, Okla., and\r\nauditor of the Arkansas Lumber Company; D. Anna; Jesse A., engaged in\r\nthe livery business at Medford, Okla.; Sadie E., wife of E. S.\r\nWoodworth, of Muscotah, a son of Major Woodworth. The Speers are a\r\nfamily of pioneers and are found to be leading citizens of their\r\nrespective communities. Joseph and Mary Speer reared their large family\r\nof children to become useful and influential members of society and God-\r\nfearing men and women. Before death called them to the eternal rest they\r\nhad the satisfaction of seeing the county where their earliest and most\r\narduous labors had been accomplished grow to become a prosperous and\r\npopulous community.\r\n\r\nD. Anna Speer was educated in the rural school of her home neighborhood\r\nand the Muscotah public school. She completed a teachers’ course in\r\nCampbell College and was graduated, receiving a life diploma from the\r\nState Normal College at Emporia, Kan., in 1893. She then taught school\r\nfor a number of years. During the summer vacations she did post-graduate\r\nwork in the University of Chicago, Kansas University and Colorado\r\nCollege, at Colorado Springs, Colo., and received the degree of Bachelor\r\nof Arts in 1911.\r\n\r\nShe entered the University of California at Berkeley and received the\r\ndegree of Master of Arts in 1913. Miss Speer is self-educated, having\r\nworked her way through college and university while teaching school to\r\nearn money for tuition and expenses. She began her teaching career with\r\na few years’ service in the rural schools and in 1893 became a teacher\r\nin the Effingham County High School, where she taught continuously for\r\nseventeen years. She was then an instructor for two years in the State\r\nNormal School at Emporia, Kan., after which she spent one year as a\r\nstudent in the University of California. After receiving her degree from\r\nthe University of California she served as instructor in Grass Valley,\r\nCal., High School. This was a delightful experience in one of the most\r\nbeautiful spots on the globe, but she returned home, and on July 1,\r\n1915, entered upon her new duties as county superintendent of public\r\ninstruction of her home county. That she will make a success of her work\r\nis assured.\r\n\r\nMiss Speer is affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal church, the\r\nEastern Star lodge and is a member of the County and State Teachers’\r\nassociations, and is a member of the National Educational Association.\r\nShe is a deep and capable student: a thorough and progressive educator,\r\nwho is familiar with the most advanced methods of teaching and is\r\ndestined to achieve marked success in her present important position.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         JOSEPH C. GREENAWALT.\r\n\r\nJoseph C. Greenawalt, retired lawyer, Muscotah, Kan., was born April 17,\r\n1840, on a farm in Montgomery county, Pennsylvania. He comes of old\r\nHolland Dutch stock and the progenitors of the Greenawalt family\r\nemigrated from Holland to America in 1665. He is a son of George and\r\nSarah (Conner) Greenawalt, natives of Pennsylvania. George Greenawalt\r\nwas a son of John, and his wife’s father was John Conner, a native of\r\nEngland. Joseph C. was eighteen months old when his father died, leaving\r\na widow with six children to rear, namely: Mary Amanda, Sarah Ann and\r\nMargaret, now deceased; Samuel C., deceased, who served as captain in a\r\ncompany in the Seventy-third regiment, New York infantry, in the Union\r\narmy, and was a wanderer from choice, having gone to sea for several\r\nyears, his first service in the Union army being as a scout; Elmina C.,\r\ndeceased, and Joseph C., with whom this review is directly concerned,\r\nand who was reared in eastern Ohio at the home of his aunt. He lived at\r\nhis aunt’s home until he attained the age of sixteen years, attended\r\nschool and learned the trade of carpenter and cabinet maker in a shop\r\noperated by his uncle.\r\n\r\nAs a boy Joseph C. Greenawalt had been ambitious to acquire an education\r\nand was not content with the idea of spending his days at the\r\ncarpenter’s bench. Accordingly, at the age of sixteen, we find that he\r\nstarted out to make his own way in the world and to educate himself by\r\npartly working his way through college. He entered Mt. Union College, at\r\nAlliance, Ohio, and was one of the first students enrolled in this\r\ncollege when it was advanced from a seminary to a regular college. He\r\nworked during the summer seasons and was thus enabled to pay his way\r\nthrough the college course. When he was eighteen years of age, he also\r\ntaught one term of school. He studied languages for one year in the\r\nHayesville Institute at Ashland, Ohio. After studying for three years at\r\nMt. Union, he matriculated at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor,\r\nMich., entering the junior class of this university in 1860. In 1862 he\r\nreceived his bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan, but did\r\nnot acquire his master’s degree until five years later, in 1867. In May\r\nof 1862 Mr. Greenawalt enlisted in Company I, Eighty-sixth regiment,\r\nOhio infantry, and served for four months, when he was commissioned a\r\nlieutenant of the Ohio Sharpshooters, but resigned his commission and\r\ntook charge of the Canton, Ohio, Union School for the ensuing six\r\nmonths. He then served as deputy clerk of the circuit court, studied law\r\nin the meantime and was admitted to the bar at Ravenna, Ohio. In the\r\nspring of 1864 Mr. Greenawalt went to Colorado and engaged in mining\r\nengineering in the mountains, forty miles west of Denver. After a stay\r\nin the West he settled in Platte City, Mo., and practiced law there\r\nuntil 1871, and after a trip to the Pacific coast, he located\r\npermanently in the city of Atchison in August of 1871. He practiced law\r\nsuccessfully for twenty-five years in Atchison, and held the office of\r\ncity attorney in 1875.\r\n\r\nMr. Greenawalt has always been a great lover of horses, and more to\r\ngratify his love of horse flesh than anything else he established in\r\n1882, the famous Greenview Stock Farm, near Atchison, now owned by B. P.\r\nWaggener. He erected the residence and several of the buildings now on\r\nthe farm and engaged in the breeding of fast trotting horses. For some\r\nyears he made his home on the farm and practiced his profession in the\r\ncity, going to and fro from his law office and giving the farm work his\r\npersonal supervision. The Greenview Stock Farm became famous for the\r\nmany fast horses bred there, one of the most noted of which was Samuel\r\nG., record 2:29, and who made a trial record of 2:18¼ when a four-year-\r\nold. He made a practice of breeding two-year-olds for speed and\r\nsucceeded, shipping horses to buyers in eastern and southern points\r\nwhere racers were desired for the tracks. In 1900 Mr. Greenawalt removed\r\nto Muscotah and continued his horse breeding until 1912, when he\r\npractically retired from the pursuit of his favorite hobby. He is the\r\nowner of a fine farm of 160 acres adjoining Muscotah on the east.\r\n\r\nMr. Greenawalt has been twice married, his first wife being Sophia E.\r\nBowers, of Cleveland, Ohio, and who died May 26, 1870, at the age of\r\ntwenty-seven years, leaving an infant daughter, Maude Mary, born\r\nFebruary 11, 1870, and died August 2, 1870. He married Mary C. Bowers,\r\nof Stark county, Ohio, in September of 1882. This marriage was blessed\r\nwith one son, Samuel O., born November 6, 1885, and died March 1, 1902.\r\nMrs. Greenawalt was born December 15, 1845, in Stark county, Ohio, a\r\ndaughter of Elijah and Mary Bowers, natives of Pennsylvania. In\r\npolitics, Mr. Greenawalt is an independent. Mrs. Greenawalt is a member\r\nof the Congregational church of Muscotah. For many years Mr. Greenawalt\r\nhas been a Mason and served as eminent commander of Washington\r\nCommandery, No. 1, at Atchison for two years, and also served as\r\nworshipful master of Active lodge of Masons, and is a member of the\r\nKnights of Pythias.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HENRY NIEMANN.\r\n\r\nWherever members of the German race have settled in the agricultural\r\nsections of the Middle West, we find that they have been uniformly\r\nsuccessful, and it is only natural to find that certain individuals\r\nachieve greater success than others. Henry Niemann, of Center township,\r\nAtchison county, is an American citizen of German birth, who came to\r\nthis country a poor emigrant lad, and has made a wonderful success since\r\nhe purchased his first eighty acre tract in this county, nearly forty\r\nyears ago. He is now one of the largest landed proprietors of the\r\ncounty, and one of the best known stockmen of northeast Kansas.\r\n\r\nHenry Niemann was born February 14, 1853, in Minden, Germany, a son of\r\nChristian and Mary (Krouse) Niemann, who lived and died in the\r\nFatherland. They were the parents of seven children as follows: Crist,\r\ndeceased; Henry, whom this review directly concerns; Fred, a farmer of\r\nCenter township; Mrs. Christena Krouse, deceased; Charles, a farmer of\r\nAtchison county; William, living in Germany, and Augustav, deceased.\r\nHenry was educated in the schools of his native land and at the age of\r\neighteen years left the Fatherland and immigrated to America in search\r\nof his fortune, which he was eventually to find in Kansas. He first\r\nsettled in Madison county, Illinois, and worked there as a farm hand for\r\nfive years. He saved his money carefully while working on the farms of\r\nIllinois, and in 1876 came to Kansas and invested in a tract of eighty\r\nacres of land in Center township. He erected a small two-room cabin on\r\nhis land and a barn to house his team of horses. He broke his land\r\ngradually and at first was able to farm only a small portion of it. The\r\nneighbors tried to discourage him by telling him that the strong winds\r\nmight wreck his home at any time and advised him to find a better and\r\nsafer location. He failed to find a place which suited him as well as\r\nhis first choice, and although he has lived for forty years on the farm\r\nhis buildings have never yet been blown away by the Kansas zephyrs. Mr.\r\nNiemann has prospered as he deserved and by the exercise of economy,\r\nhard work and good financial judgment, has become the owner of 615 acres\r\nof land in several farms, all of which are well improved and highly\r\nproductive. Mr. Niemann is an extensive feeder of hogs and raises large\r\nnumbers annually for the market. He believes in feeding the grain\r\nproducts of his farm to live stock on the place and thus reaps greater\r\nbenefits than the ordinary methods of farming would yield. He is a\r\nstockholder in a prosperous mercantile concern at Nortonville, Kan.\r\n\r\nMr. Niemann was married in 1897 to Louise Frommer, and to this marriage\r\nhave been born ten children, namely: Mrs. Mary Dietrich, a widow, who\r\nlives with her parents; Rosa, widow of George Moeck, also living with\r\nher parents; Christena, deceased; Dena, deceased; William, a farmer\r\nliving in Center township; Mrs. Dora Dietrich, deceased; Harry, Henry\r\nand Julius, living at home, and Mrs. Lillie Poos, Nortonville, Kan. The\r\nmother of these children was born in Wurtemberg, Germany, in 1858, a\r\ndaughter of John and Kathrine (Markley) Frommer, natives of Germany, who\r\nwere early settlers of Atchison county.\r\n\r\nMr. Niemann is an independent Republican voter, who refuses to wear the\r\ncollar of any one set of political bosses, and votes as his judgment\r\nindicates. He and his family are members of the German Lutheran church.\r\nHenry Niemann is a fine type of successful German-American farmer and is\r\na tiller of the soil first and last; he lays claim to no ambition beyond\r\ntilling his broad acres and making his land yield the maximum of\r\nsustenance for man and beast; his great success lays in the fact that he\r\nhas confined his energies to the soil and its cultivation and he has\r\nmanaged to get a good slice of the best land obtainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FRED W. KAUFMAN.\r\n\r\nFred W. Kaufman, merchant, Cummings, Kan., was born in Nortonville,\r\nKan., February 18, 1879. He is a son of Frank and Louise (Baker)\r\nKaufman, who were the parents of thirteen children. Frank Kaufman was\r\nborn in Servia, Germany, in 1833. When a youth, in his native land he\r\nlearned the shoemaker’s trade which he followed there until eighteen\r\nyears of age, and he then emigrated from Germany to America in 1851. He\r\ncame to Atchison, Kan., and worked as a cobbler. When the town of\r\nPardee, Kan., was founded, Mr. Kaufman opened a shoe shop in that town\r\nand conducted it for about four years, after which he located in\r\nNortonville and worked at his trade until his demise in 1911. The\r\nchildren of Frank and Louise Kaufman were as follows: Charles, deceased,\r\nmerchant of Nortonville, born 1866, died 1908; Edward, a merchant,\r\nNortonville; Fred, a merchant of Cummings, Kan., the subject of this\r\nreview; Mrs. Anna Coon, of Rock Creek, Kan.; Mrs. Flora Hilderbrand,\r\nIndependence, Kan.; Walter, a farmer, living near Cleveland, Okla.;\r\nGrace, residing at Nortonville. The mother of these children was born\r\nnear the city of Atchison, and is now living in Nortonville.\r\n\r\nFred Kaufman was reared in Nortonville and attended the public schools\r\nof his native city after which he studied in the Atchison Business\r\nCollege. At the age of fifteen years he was employed as clerk in a\r\ngeneral merchandise store in his home city. In 1900 he went to St.\r\nJoseph, Mo., where he was employed in the wholesale department of the\r\nWheeler & Motter Mercantile Company for a period of nine years, and\r\nserved in the capacity of mail order clerk in this establishment. He was\r\nthen given a traveling position as salesman with his firm and for three\r\nyears sold goods in the surrounding territory with considerable success.\r\nHis ambitions led him to undertake things in his own behalf, however,\r\nand in 1912 Mr. Kaufman located in Colorado, where he was engaged in\r\nranching for three years. Three years’ hard work enabled him to develop\r\nhis Colorado farm into a good piece of salable property and he then\r\ndisposed of his holdings and came to Cummings where he invested his cash\r\ncapital in a general merchandise store which he is conducting with\r\nconsiderable success. His previous commercial experience has proven to\r\nbe invaluable to him since entering the mercantile field in his own\r\nbehalf, and he has developed a splendid business in Cummings. Besides\r\nhis large store in Cummings, Mr. Kaufman has invested in 210 acres of\r\nland in Colorado and Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nMr. Kaufman was married September 6, 1905, to Carrie E. Hackney, and\r\nthis marriage has been blessed with two children: Fred, Jr., and Maxine\r\nC., both of whom are at home with their parents. Mrs. Kaufman was born\r\nOctober 27, 1884, at Agency, Buchanan county, Missouri, and is a\r\ndaughter of Alfred and Pauline (Slover) Hackney, natives of Wisconsin\r\nand Missouri, respectively. Alfred Hackney was a son of Thomas and Mary\r\n(Saxton) Hackney, the former a native of England. Thomas was an early\r\npioneer settler in Doniphan county, Kansas, coming there about 1852, and\r\nalso operated a drug store at Wathena, Doniphan county. Mrs. Thomas\r\nHackney is still living at the age of eighty-eight years, born August,\r\n1827. Alfred is now living in retirement at St. Joseph, Mo., and has\r\nattained the age of sixty-five years. Mrs. Kaufman’s mother died in\r\n1904, at the age of forty years.\r\n\r\nMr. Kaufman is a Republican in politics and is affiliated with the\r\nUnited Commercial Travelers’ lodge at Hastings, Neb. He and Mrs. Kaufman\r\nattend religious worship at the Baptist church, of which Mrs. Kaufman is\r\na member. Mr. Kaufman is a splendid type of self-made man whose success\r\nin the mercantile field is certain to continue in the years to come. His\r\nbusiness methods are such as to commend him favorably to the many\r\npatrons of his store; he is likewise a good citizen who has the best\r\ninterest of his town and county at heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ARNOLD LANGE.\r\n\r\nLancaster township, Atchison county, is rightly considered as one of the\r\ngenuine garden spots of the State of Kansas, because of the fertility of\r\nthe soil, the well kept appearance of the fields, and the excellent\r\nimprovements on the farms, the owners of which seem to vie with each\r\nother as to who can have the nicest looking and most productive farm.\r\nThis township has a large German population, or rather, American citizen\r\nfarmers, of German birth or descent, and it is a proverb in this land\r\nthat, wherever you see a community of thrifty farmers of German descent,\r\nthere you will find enterprise, thrift and progress. Arnold Lange, of\r\nthis township, is a successful farmer and breeder, of German birth who\r\nhas made good in his adopted country and holds a high place in the\r\ncitizenship of the county.\r\n\r\nArnold Lange was born in Westphalia, Prussia, German Empire, December\r\n23, 1853, and is a son of Herman and Charlotte (Mittendorf) Lange, who\r\nwere born and reared in the Fatherland. Herman Lange was a farmer and\r\ncoal dealer, and also conducted a grocery store for a time. He was born\r\nin 1824, lived all of his life in his native land and died in 1907. His\r\nwife, Charlotte, died in 1899, at the age of seventy-six years. They\r\nwere the parents of twelve children, six of whom are living.\r\n\r\nArnold Lange received his schooling in Germany and worked as farmer and\r\nteamster until his emigration from Germany to America in 1882. He\r\nsettled in Atchison county and invested his capital in eighty acres of\r\nland north of Huron, which he cultivated for nine years with fair\r\nsuccess. He then sold the farm at an increase over the purchase price\r\nand bought the farm which now constitutes his home place and which\r\ncontains 240 acres of good land. The improvements on the land when Mr.\r\nLange purchased the tract were indifferent and included a small house.\r\nNaturally one of his thrift and pride could not remain long content with\r\npoor accommodations and he has built a commodious farm residence and a\r\nvery fine barn and improved the looks of his place with shrubbery and\r\ntrees until it presents a handsome appearance. He has also set out an\r\norchard of six acres. Mr. Lange has specialized in his live stock\r\nraising with considerable success and his efforts in breeding\r\nthoroughbred Percheron horses have met with reward commensurate with his\r\nefforts. He has bred and raised some very fine animals of this class and\r\nin 1906 was awarded first prize on Percheron draft animals at the county\r\nfair held in Effingham. His interest is given to breeding fine cattle\r\nand his herd of shorthorns are as good as can be found in the county.\r\n\r\nMr. Lange was married in 1883 to Miss Minnie Kloepper, who has borne him\r\nthree children: Herman, of Huron, Kan.; William, a farmer, of\r\nGrasshopper township, and Arnold, a graduate of the Huron schools and at\r\nhome assisting his father in the farm work. The mother of these children\r\nwas born December 14, 1865, in Illinois, and is a daughter of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Christian Kloepper deceased. Mr. Lange is a Democrat, and is a\r\nmember of the German Lutheran church. He is fraternally connected with\r\nthe Modern Woodmen lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM H. GRANER.\r\n\r\n                          “_The Graner Farm._”\r\n\r\nAccording to competent authority there are in Atchison county a number\r\nof pure bred live stock breeders, who, if they received the recognition\r\nto which they are rightly entitled, would take high rank among the\r\nleading live stock men of the country. Among these specialists are\r\nWilliam H. and Henry C. Graner, sons of one of the pioneer pure bred\r\nlive stock breeders of the county who are following in their father’s\r\nfootsteps and have made a name and fame for themselves which extend far\r\nbeyond the borders of this county and beyond the borders of the State of\r\nKansas. William H. Graner, proprietor of the “Graner Farm,” which is the\r\nold homestead of the Graner family, is one of the most successful\r\nagriculturists of the county and is deserving of special credit for his\r\nprogressiveness and decided ability as a breeder of fine live stock. The\r\n“Graner Farm” is one of the best stocked and best equipped ranches in\r\nthe West and is noted for its fine Shorthorn cattle and standard bred\r\nPercheron horses. Mr. Graner learned the breeding business from his\r\nfather and has made a success of the undertaking. His farm consists of\r\n160 acres, which was formerly owned and developed by his father,\r\nGottlieb Graner. On this farm are some very fine animals of the pure\r\nbred Shorthorn type which will compare most favorably in breeding and\r\nappearance with anything of the kind in the country. His herd of\r\nPercherons include twenty registered mares which have won many prizes at\r\ncounty fairs and live stock exhibits in Kansas. Mr. Graner has owned and\r\nused two grandsons of “Brilliant,” the sons of “Old Brilliant,” and sire\r\nof these animals, the “Colored Gentleman,” was awarded first and\r\nchampionship over all draft horses at the world’s exhibit of live stock\r\nat the Chicago international exhibition in 1893. All of his mares’\r\nancestry is traced back to “Old Brilliant” and this strain predominates\r\nin his drove of fine Percherons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Gottlieb Graner_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Martha (Hauck) Graner_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Old Graner Homestead, W.

C. Graner’s Annual Sale of\r\n    Large Type Poland China Sows, May 27, 1913. Pleasant Hill Stock\r\n    Farm, Lancaster, Kansas.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the breeding of Shorthorn cattle he has used such sires as a son of\r\nthe imported cow, “Ballechin,” “Charming Maid,” V67–616, “Sire\r\nCeremonious Archer,” 171479. A number of the cows in Mr. Graner’s herd\r\nare sired by “Victor Archer,” 223102, a pure Victoria, and one of the\r\nfinest strains of Shorthorn cattle known. Mr. Graner has not shown any\r\nof his fine stock cattle outside of Atchison county. He has six large\r\ncattle barns for the housing of his live stock and ships the product of\r\nhis farm to buyers and fanciers in all parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nGottlieb Graner, founder of the “Graner Farm,” and father of William H.\r\nand Henry C. Graner, of Lancaster township, was born in Germany in 1835,\r\nand immigrated from the Fatherland to America at the age of sixteen\r\nyears. He first settled in Illinois where he worked as a farm hand, and\r\na few years later came west to Kansas City, Mo. In this city he invested\r\nhis savings in a city lot which is now in the heart of the most valuable\r\nbusiness district of the southwest metropolis, but he eventually let the\r\nlot go for taxes. From Kansas City he made his way to the city of\r\nAtchison where he found employment in a brewery at a salary of $100 per\r\nmonth. He saved his money and in 1868 purchased 160 acres of raw prairie\r\nland in Lancaster township, for which he paid five dollars an acre. He\r\nbecame a breeder of Shorthorn cattle and Percheron horses and succeeded\r\nin this undertaking, being one of the pioneer breeders of the western\r\ncountry. At the time of his demise, in 1894, he was the owner of 560\r\nacres of well improved farm lands.\r\n\r\nGottlieb Graner married Martha Hauck, also a native of Germany, and who\r\ndied in 1905. To this well and favorably known pioneer couple were born\r\nthe following children: Mrs. Matilda Stansburger, a widow, residing in\r\nCalifornia; William H., with whose career this review is directly\r\nconcerned; Henry C., a farmer and stockman, living near William H.;\r\nFerdinand, living in New York, and Adolph, residing in California. Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Gottlieb Graner were Lutherans, and honest, industrious, God-\r\nfearing people.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Graner was born June 13, 1869, on the farm which he now owns\r\nin Lancaster township. He was reared on his father’s farm and attended\r\nthe Bell district school and also studied in the Monroe Institute at\r\nAtchison, after which he pursued a course in the Atchison business\r\ncollege. His commercial course occupied a period of four years and has\r\nproven to be invaluable to him in the management of his extensive\r\nfarming interests. After completing his commercial course Mr. Graner\r\nwent to work on the home farm with his father. After his father’s demise\r\nin 1894 he took charge of the farm and managed it until all the children\r\nbecame of age. The estate left by his father was then divided, and\r\nWilliam bought the interests of the other heirs in the home farm and\r\ncame into possession of the homestead place of 160 acres which he has\r\nimproved with several barns and modern farm buildings. He has prospered\r\nand is now the owner of 560 acres of land, two farms, each of which is\r\nwell equipped with good buildings. One of these farms is tilled by a\r\ntenant, and Mr. Graner had planted in 1915 140 acres of corn.\r\n\r\nMr. Graner was married in 1898 to Miss Clara Matthias, and to this union\r\nhave been born four children, namely: Martha, deceased; Louis,\r\nMarguerite and Esther, at home with their parents. Mrs. Graner was born\r\nFebruary 6, 1871, in Lancaster township, a daughter of Fred and Agnes\r\n(Bodendoerfer) Matthias, both of whom were natives of Germany and\r\nimmigrated from the Fatherland to America and became early pioneer\r\nsettlers in Atchison county. Mrs. Graner attended the Rock district\r\nschool in her youth and is an excellent helpmeet to her husband and a\r\nkind mother to her children.\r\n\r\nMr. Graner is an independent in politics and prefers to vote for the\r\nman, regardless of party affiliations. He is a member of the Lutheran\r\nchurch, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and Modern Woodmen of America.\r\nHe is a well educated and versatile citizen and a capable and successful\r\nbusiness man, as well as farmer and breeder. He has achieved a\r\nconsiderable measure of prominence in the county and State because of\r\nhis decided ability. Besides his farming interests he is a stockholder\r\nof the Independent Harvester Company of Plano, Ill., of which concern he\r\nis the county agent, a large warehouse having keen erected on the\r\n“Graner Farm” for the purpose of housing the implement stock sold to\r\nfarmers in the neighborhood. Mr. Graner is a member and stockholder of\r\nthe Percheron Society of America, the Importers and Breeders, and the\r\nAmerican Percheron Registry Association, and is a member of the American\r\nShorthorn Breeders’ Association. He is a director in the Brown County\r\nMutual Fire Insurance Company, of which prosperous concern he has been a\r\ndirector for fifteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HENRY C. GRANER.\r\n\r\n                     “_Pleasant Hill Stock Farm._”\r\n\r\nSituated on a hillside within sight of the old Graner homestead in\r\nLancaster township, Atchison county, is the “Pleasant Hill Stock Farm,”\r\nowned and managed by Henry C. Graner, one of the most successful and\r\nbest known farmers and breeders of northeast Kansas. Mr. Graner is a son\r\nof Gottlieb Graner, a pioneer in the pure bred live stock industry of\r\nAtchison county, whose biography appears in the review of the life of\r\nWilliam H. Graner on the preceding pages of this history of their home\r\ncounty. The “Pleasant Hill Stock Farm” is unquestionably one of the best\r\nequipped modern breeding plants in the State of Kansas and is famed over\r\nthe West for the product of its fields and barns. This farm consists of\r\n240 acres of well tilled and well improved land, situated two miles\r\nnorth of the town of Lancaster and only a quarter of a mile from the\r\nbirthplace of Henry C. Graner. In addition to his home place, Mr. Graner\r\nis the owner of 160 acres of land which he uses for pasturing his live\r\nstock. The home farm is well equipped with two farm dwellings and five\r\nwell built barns and granaries with other conveniences to facilitate the\r\nhandling of live stock. The owner has given special attention to\r\nequipping his farm for the breeding of fine cattle and hogs. He pays a\r\ngreat deal of attention to his Poland China hogs and is a breeder of the\r\nBig Type Poland China swine, which are among the best in the United\r\nStates. Mr. Graner ships the product of his breeding pens to all parts\r\nof the country and has annual sales of thoroughbred hogs which are a\r\nfeature of the countryside. To show the prices obtained from his sales\r\nin 1914, one small sow sold for $500. He handles the Big Type Poland\r\nChina breed exclusively and is a regular exhibitor at county fairs and\r\nhas frequently taken first prizes and many blue ribbons. His drove of\r\nfine hogs exceeded 300 in 1915, all pure bred stock.\r\n\r\nMr. Graner’s herd of Shorthorn cattle is of the Scotch pure bred strain\r\nand bred to “Choice Goods,” a famous strain known the world over for\r\nquality. He has also shown his fine cattle at the county fairs and live\r\nstock exhibits and carried off many first prizes. His herd of pure bred\r\nShorthorns numbers fifty head at the present time, all registered stock.\r\nIn addition to being a breeder of hogs and cattle Mr. Graner breeds\r\nstandard Percheron horses of the imported strain sired by “Brilliant,”\r\nof which he has usually from twenty-five to thirty head of fine stock on\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nHenry C. Graner was born April 19, 1871, on the old Graner homestead in\r\nLancaster township, on which he was reared to young manhood. When a\r\nsmall boy he attended school in the village of Lancaster, and after the\r\nschool house was erected in the neighborhood he went to the district\r\nschool. He was one of the first students to enter Midland College in\r\nAtchison and there completed his education. He remained on the home farm\r\nuntil 1901 and then bought the farm which he now owns, first consisting\r\nof 160 acres, to which lie afterwards added an eighty. He later invested\r\nin another quarter section which he uses for pasture.\r\n\r\nHe was married June 6, 1901, to Miss Mary K. Meck, who has borne him\r\nfive children, as follows: Lillian, born October 11, 1902; Matilda, born\r\nApril 21, 1904; Louise, born June 1, 1907; Henrietta, born March 11,\r\n1910; and Frederick, born April 8, 1913. The mother of these children\r\nwas born in Center township August 31, 1874, a daughter of Fred Meck,\r\nnow living on a farm in Center township, Atchison county. Mrs. Graner is\r\na capable woman, a devoted wife and mother, and the Graner home is a\r\nvery happy one at all times.\r\n\r\nMr. Graner is a Democrat in politics, but has little time to devote to\r\nthe political game other than to vote for his favorite candidates at\r\nelection time. He and Mrs. Graner are members of the Lancaster\r\nPresbyterian church, of which institution Mr. Graner is a trustee. He is\r\naffiliated with the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, the Independent\r\nOrder of Odd Fellows, and the Modern Woodmen of America. He is also a\r\nmember of the Standard Bred Poland China Record Association, and the\r\nPercheron Society of America. Mr. Graner’s success has been mainly due\r\nto hard work, close application to his affairs and keen financial\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            RICHARD E. KING.\r\n\r\nRichard E. King, farmer of Oak Mills, Walnut township, Atchison county,\r\nwas born in this county, January 11, 1876. He was a son of Richard M.\r\nKing, pioneer, farmer, merchant and early-day freighter, who was born in\r\nSmith county, Tennessee, January 23, 1837. Richard M. was a son of\r\nAbraham and Mahaley (James) King, natives of Virginia, who came to\r\nTennessee in 1833. They migrated from Tennessee to Buchanan county,\r\nMissouri, in 1851, and one year later moved to a farm in Platte county,\r\nMissouri, where Abraham King and his wife eventually died. Richard M.\r\nKing crossed the plains with a freighting outfit which started from Ft.\r\nLeavenworth en route Ft. Laramie in Wyoming, and met with considerable\r\nadventure on the long trip, which consumed ninety days going and\r\nreturning. The Indians molested them frequently, and one time a\r\nmischievous band stole all the tongue pins from their wagons. Another\r\ntime, when they were in camp, a band of hundreds of Pawnees swarmed\r\naround the train and tried to intimidate the men. One big Pawnee buck,\r\nuttering a loud “woof,” stuck a spear in Mr. King’s stomach. On account\r\nof the Indian force being of superior number to the whites, they did not\r\ndare take offense at anything they did, or seem offended at any of their\r\npranks for fear of massacre. Richard M. King followed freighting four\r\nyears and made his last trip to the far West in 1862, from Ft.\r\nLeavenworth, Kan., to Ft. Union, N. M. He came back from this trip, and\r\nwith his savings bought a tract of land on the Missouri river in Walnut\r\ntownship. Unhappily, this land was eventually cut off from the mainland\r\nby the freakish Missouri, when it once more changed its course, and,\r\nalthough the deed to the land is still held by Richard M. King the muddy\r\nwaters of the Missouri flow over it. In 1866 he bought forty acres of\r\nland in the hills, back from the river. He was married November 22,\r\n1863, to Mary Frances Hottle, a daughter of David and Frances (Creal)\r\nHottle, both of whom were natives of Brook county, Virginia. They too,\r\ncame to Kansas in the early days, and settled in Leavenworth county, in\r\n1855. David Hottle was a butcher by trade and bought and killed the\r\nfirst beef ever slaughtered in the historic town of Kickapoo,\r\nLeavenworth county. Kickapoo was a hotbed of the pro-slavery element in\r\nthose days and woe betide the man who opposed their wishes. Two children\r\nwere born to Richard M. King and wife: Lucy Ann, born August 27, 1864,\r\ndeceased wife of Thomas Reagan, a passenger conductor on the Missouri\r\nPacific railway. To Mr. and Mrs. Reagan were born two children, Thomas\r\nD., born March 8, 1889, and John M., born August 7, 1905; Richard E.,\r\nthe subject of this review.\r\n\r\nRichard E. King grew to manhood on the home farm and was educated in the\r\ncommon schools of his native county and the high school at Kansas City,\r\nKan. He was married in 1895 to Mary Sacks, a daughter of Henry Sacks, of\r\nAtchison county. She died in 1898, and after her death, Mr. King went to\r\nKansas City, Kan., to reside and was there engaged in various pursuits.\r\nHe married Miss Sue Allen in Kansas City, Kan., January 16, 1900. Mrs.\r\nKing is a daughter of James T. and Jane (McCampbell) Allen, both natives\r\nof Woodford county, Kentucky, whose people removed from the ancestral\r\nhome of the family in Virginia to Kentucky. The old Allen homestead,\r\nbuilt of natural stone is still standing in the latter State, a\r\npicturesque and beautiful reminder of ante-bellum days. In 1885 James T.\r\nAllen and family left Kentucky and went to Cass county, Missouri, where\r\nthey resided on a farm until 1903, and then removed to Harrisonville,\r\nMo., where they now live. One child has been born to Mr. and Mrs.\r\nRichard E. King, Richard Allen King, born July 12, 1903, a bright and\r\nintelligent boy and is an excellent student in school.\r\n\r\nThe King home, situated on a bluff overlooking the reaches of the old\r\nMissouri river, is noted for its hospitality and good cheer. Their home\r\nhas been named “Che-me-o-kah,” a Kaw Indian term, meaning “Lodge of the\r\nRising Sun,” or “Sunrise Cottage.” The Kaw Indians had a village on this\r\nfarm in ancient times. Mr. and Mrs. King are a fine young couple who are\r\nhighly esteemed by all who know them. Mrs. Richard M. King has one of\r\nthe most remarkable collections of family heirlooms in Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JOHN MOECK.\r\n\r\nJohn Moeck, farmer, of Center township, Atchison county, was born in\r\nWurtemberg, Germany, March 17, 1869. He is a son of Henry and Eva\r\n(Heinz) Moeck, who were the parents of the following children: Mrs.\r\nKathrine Younger, living near Potter, Kan.; Anna, deceased; Henry,\r\nfarmer, Germany; John, subject of this sketch; Karl, Osborne county,\r\nKansas; Regina, Atchison, Kan.; and George, deceased. The father was\r\nborn April 3, 1839, in Germany, where he spent his life. He was a son of\r\nHenry Moeck, also a native of Germany. His wife, Eva, was born December\r\n1, 1841. She is a native of Germany, and is now living on a farm in that\r\ncountry. John Moeck, the subject of this sketch, attended the schools in\r\nGermany, and in 1883 immigrated to the United States, settling in\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, where he worked on a farm for his board and\r\nclothing. He attended the district schools of Center township until he\r\nwas twenty-one years old. During this time he was living with his uncle,\r\nFred Moeck, and the following five years he worked as a farm hand. He\r\nwas then married, and settled down on the farm which he now owns. He\r\nrented it for a time, until he was able to accumulate enough to buy it.\r\nHe bought the place in 1898, and has owned it since that time. The farm\r\nconsists of 145 acres of fine land, which the owner has improved\r\nextensively. Two acres of the place is planted with fine fruit-bearing\r\ntrees. Mr. Moeck keeps high grade stock on his farm.\r\n\r\nThe career of Mr. Moeck shows what one can do by hard work. When he\r\narrived in Atchison county he had only four dollars, and every cent that\r\nhe now owns has been earned by hard work since he came to Atchison\r\ncounty. Mr. Moeck is a self-made man, who has won a desirable place for\r\nhimself in his community. That his fellow citizens hold him in high\r\nregard, is shown by the fact that they elected him to the office of\r\ntownship treasurer for two terms. He has been road overseer, and is now\r\na member of the school board.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Mr. Moeck married Kathrine Ziegler, who was born April 5, 1875.\r\nShe is a native of Germany, and the daughter of George and Agnes\r\n(Frommer) Ziegler. When a child five years old Mrs. Moeck came to\r\nAmerica with her parents, who settled in Center township, Atchison\r\ncounty. Mr. and Mrs. Moeck have four children: Eva, Louise, Frieda, and\r\nWalter, living at home. Mr. Moeck is a Republican. He is an elder in the\r\nGerman Lutheran church. In reviewing his life, it is only fair to say\r\nthat he is one of those self-made citizens who form the solid foundation\r\nof our democracy. By his own efforts he has climbed to the top, and has\r\nshown by his life what the man who will try can accomplish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOHN O. A. MILLER.\r\n\r\nJohn O. A. Miller, farmer and stockman, of Kapioma township, Atchison\r\ncounty, was born January 1, 1872, in Kapioma township. He is a son of\r\nJames and Eliza (Russell) Miller, who were the parents of eight\r\nchildren, one of whom is dead. The father, James Miller, was born in\r\nClay county, Missouri, August 3, 1831, and was a son of Moses Miller, a\r\nnative of Kentucky. James Miller grew up on his father’s farm and at the\r\nage of eighteen crossed the wild western plains to New Mexico, working\r\nfor the Government. He found a few years of the strenuous life enough\r\nand settled down to farming in Atchison county in 1854. He bought 160\r\nacres of land from a land company. The farm was composed of good bottom\r\nland and he made extensive improvements on the profitable returns which\r\nhis large crops brought. He was a large breeder of cattle, especially\r\nShorthorns, and his judgment on cattle was regarded as authoritative. He\r\nwas known throughout that part of the country as the “cattle king.” He\r\nfarmed 700 acres until his death. During his life time he held a number\r\nof township offices. His successful career ended September 12, 1913,\r\nwith his death at Muscotah, Kan. His wife, who was a native of Iowa,\r\ndied in 1879.\r\n\r\nJohn Miller grew up on his father’s farm. He attended the Atchison\r\nCounty High School at Effingham, Kan., and after working a short time he\r\nwent to the State Normal School at Emporia, Kan. To earn his way through\r\ncollege he worked as a farm hand until he had saved enough money to\r\ncarry him through school. After leaving the State Normal School he\r\nrented the farm which he now owns, and in 1912 bought it. The place\r\nconsists of 160 acres. In 1914 he built a fine barn, which is one of the\r\nbest in the State for its size. It is 40×52 feet and has a smaller wing,\r\n26×14 feet, with a capacity of seventy-five tons of hay. It is strongly\r\nconstructed and is a model barn. Mr. Miller maintains that stock as fine\r\nas his ought to have a good barn in which to live. He makes a specialty\r\nof Percheron horses and Chester White hogs. He is also a breeder of\r\nShorthorn cattle and has maintained the same strain which his father\r\nkept. In addition to his activities in the rural life of his\r\nneighborhood Mr. Miller is active in the business affairs of Muscotah.\r\nHe is a director and stockholder in the State Bank at Muscotah, Kan.,\r\nand has an interest in the Farmers’ Grain and Elevator Supply Company\r\nand the Mutual Telephone Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 he married Jane Ernst, who was born November 6, 1871, in Kapioma\r\ntownship, Atchison county. She is a daughter of John and Eliza (Lewis)\r\nErnst. The father is a native of Germany and the mother of Norway, and\r\nboth came to Atchison county, Kansas, in the early days. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMiller have two children: Alice E. and Mary E., twins, who are living at\r\nhome. Mr. Miller is a Democrat and has been treasurer of Kapioma\r\ntownship. He is a member of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHARLES CARLTON HART.\r\n\r\nFor a Kansas citizen and pioneer settler to spend the better part of a\r\nlifetime in building up a fine and highly productive farm, and then to\r\nenter the banking business at a time when most men are ready to retire\r\nand live a life of ease, is rather out of the ordinary, but such has\r\nbeen the experience of C. C. Hart, banker, of Muscotah, Kan. Mr. Hart\r\nhas lived in Kansas for forty-seven years and has been successively\r\nfarmer and banker during that time. He is a descendant of one of the old\r\nfamilies in America and comes of a family of ministers and teachers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _C. C. Hart_\r\n]\r\n\r\nC. C. Hart was born December 6, 1842, in Sandusky, Ohio, and was a son\r\nof Rev. Ichabod and Harriet (Whitcomb) Hart, the former a native of New\r\nYork, and the latter was born in Templeton, Mass., April 22, 1819, and\r\ndied in Chicago, Ill., April 30, 1889. The Hart family is a very old one\r\nin America and is descended from two English immigrants who settled in\r\nConnecticut in the colonial period of our Nation’s history, and from\r\nwhom the city of Hartford took its name in the seventeenth century.\r\nSeveral descendants of these early pioneers fought for the cause of\r\nAmerican independence in the American Revolution and also in the War of\r\n1812. Two brothers of C. C. Hart served in the Union army in the late\r\nCivil war. The father of C. C. Hart was educated for the Presbyterian\r\nministry and later became a Congregational minister. He received his\r\ncollege training in Princeton University and migrated to Ohio in 1840;\r\nresided at Sandusky until 1843, and then took charge of a church at\r\nMedina, Ohio, until 1844, when he removed to Kenosha, Wis. After several\r\nyears’ ministerial work in Wisconsin he located in Illinois, and died at\r\nWheaton, that State, in 1870, at the ripe old age of eighty-four years.\r\nRev. Hart was the father of eight children: Edwin R. received a college\r\neducation and served in the Union army; Rev. Walter O. Hart, a Union\r\nveteran, now located in North Carolina; Eliza born in Kenosha, Wis.,\r\nJanuary 23, 1847, married George W. Phillips, and died September 15,\r\n1875, at Llano, Texas, one and one-half years after her marriage. While\r\ncarrying on his ministerial work the Rev. Ichabod Hart also conducted a\r\nfarm in the neighborhood of his work. Edwin R. Hart was educated in\r\nOberlin College, Ohio, and Walter O. received a college and theological\r\ninstitute education and is now living in retirement with his son who\r\nalso is a minister.\r\n\r\nC. C. Hart, with whom this review is directly concerned, was reared to\r\nyoung manhood on his father’s farm and attended the schools of Genoa,\r\nWis. During the Civil war lie remained at home and assisted his father\r\nin the farm work. In 1868 he decided to strike out for himself and try\r\nhis fortunes in the West. He came to Kansas and located in Jackson\r\ncounty, on the western border of Atchison county, where he purchased 160\r\nacres of railroad owned land, at a cost of five dollars and forty cents\r\nper acre. He at once began improving this tract which was raw prairie at\r\nthe time of purchase and in the course of time developed it into a fine\r\nand highly productive farm. The Hart farm is one of the most productive\r\nand best improved in the State of Kansas and is widely known for the\r\nexcellent shape in which the grounds and improvements are kept. Mr. Hart\r\nadded eighty acres adjoining in Atchison county to the original quarter\r\nsection and now has 240 acres in all. He remained on the farm until\r\n1905, in the meantime having become interested in the Muscotah State\r\nBank as a stockholder and director. In that year he removed to the town\r\nof Muscotah, where he has since made his residence in an attractive\r\nhome. Mr. Hart was elected cashier of the bank January 1, 1910, and\r\nserved in this capacity until August 1, 1915. While cashier he also\r\nserved as vice-president of the institution and is now connected with\r\nthe bank in that capacity.\r\n\r\nMr. Hart was married in 1867 to Miss Emma A. Olden, who has borne him\r\nthe following children: Arthur C., born in 1873, married Bertie\r\nStockton, and has one child, Dorothy, residing in Bakersfield, Cal.;\r\nDwight Hart died in youth. Mrs. Emma A. (Olden) Hart, the mother, was\r\nborn in Wisconsin in 1846, and is a daughter of Enos Olden, a native of\r\nNew York State, and a descendant of an old eastern family.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party has always claimed the allegiance of Mr. Hart, and\r\nhe has taken an active part in political affairs during his long\r\nresidence in Grasshopper township and Muscotah. While living on the farm\r\nhe held various township offices, and was always found in the forefront\r\nof civic movements which had for their intention the ultimate good of\r\nall the people. He filled the post of mayor of Muscotah for four years\r\nand was a good official. In church work he has been very active and is\r\nat present the treasurer of the Congregational church. His work in the\r\ninterest of the young people of Muscotah has endeared him to all of the\r\nresidents and for twenty-five years he has served as the superintendent\r\nof the Sunday school of his church. Mr. Hart was secretary of the\r\nAtchison County Sunday School Association for ten years. Although this\r\ngrand old pioneer has passed the allotted three score and ten years of\r\nage. He is still active, mentally and physically, and rarely a day\r\npasses which does not find him at his desk attending to his duties in\r\nthe bank or working about the grounds of his attractive, well kept home.\r\nMr. Hart is a courteous and kindly gentleman of the old school whom one\r\ncan not help but admire for his many sterling qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WILLIAM YOUNG.\r\n\r\nA native born Kansan, who became a successful agriculturist and banker,\r\nand left an indelible imprint upon the business and social life of\r\nAtchison county, was the late William Young, of Arrington, Kan. The\r\nYoung family was one of the real pioneer families of the county, and the\r\nlate Mr. Young was born on a pioneer farm in Mt. Pleasant township May\r\n20, 1858. He was a son of William Johnson Young, whose wife was Mrs.\r\nMartha (Wamach) Snowden, widow, born in Virginia, a daughter of Abraham\r\nWamach, an early pioneer settler of Atchison county, who came to this\r\ncounty in 1854 and settled on adjoining homesteads with W. J. Young. W.\r\nJ. Young, the father of William, was born in Tennessee in 1815, and was\r\nthe first judge of Atchison county. He settled on a farm in Walnut\r\ntownship, two and one-half miles northeast of Potter, Kan., which farm\r\nis now owned by Peter C. Griner. The elder Young was a natural born\r\nleader of men, and took an active and influential part in the political\r\naffairs of the county in the early days. He was a religious man, whose\r\nhome was a meeting place for the politicians and ministers of the\r\nGospel, and he was very hospitable. His father was the Rev. Duke Young,\r\na native of Tennessee, who came to Kansas in 1854, and preached the\r\nfirst sermon in the county, on the doctrine of the Christian\r\ndenomination. The Rev. Mr. Young was about sixty years of age when he\r\ncame to Atchison county, and he had been preaching the Gospel for many\r\nyears in Tennessee. J. W. Young became a member of the Christian church\r\nwhen sixteen years of age. The Young family was of Scotch-Irish\r\nancestry.\r\n\r\nWilliam Young, with whom this review is directly concerned, was one of a\r\nfamily of fourteen children reared by his parents. He grew to manhood on\r\nhis father’s farm, and after his marriage, in 1880, he and his wife\r\nlocated on a farm in Mt. Pleasant township, near the town of Potter, and\r\ndeveloped it into a fine and productive tract. He continued in\r\nagricultural pursuits until 1908, when he went to Arrington, Kan., and\r\npurchased the Arrington State Bank, which he operated until his demise,\r\nJanuary 12, 1910. After Mr. Young’s death, his widow disposed of the\r\nbank and the Arrington property, and removed to Atchison, where she has\r\nsince made her home at 419 Kearney street.\r\n\r\nWilliam Young was married February 5, 1880, to Miss Angie Cooley, and to\r\nthis union were born the following children: Maude, wife of Earl\r\nStapler, Atchison; Duff D. Young, born April 8, 1901. The mother of\r\nthese children was born November 9, 1861, a daughter of James and\r\nCassendania (Waddle) Cooley, both of whom were born and reared in\r\nKentucky. James Cooley, her father, migrated to Kansas in 1854 and\r\nsettled on a homestead south of Potter, in Leavenworth county. His wife,\r\nCassendania, came to Kansas to reside with her sister, Mrs. Masterson,\r\nwho lived in Mt. Pleasant township, and she was married in 1860 to James\r\nCooley. Eight children were born to them, of whom Mrs. Young was the\r\nfifth in order of birth. James Cooley took an active and prominent part\r\nin political affairs in Kansas in the early days, and served as the\r\nrepresentative to the State legislature from Leavenworth county for two\r\nterms, from 1868 to 1872, inclusive. He died in 1876.\r\n\r\nWilliam Young was a member of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, the\r\nOdd Fellows, and the Fraternal Aid Union. He was a man who lived his\r\nlife according to Christian precepts, and was a regular attendant at\r\nchurch and Sunday school of the Christian denomination. His start in\r\nlife was at the foot of the ladder, and he was successful in his\r\nundertakings, building for himself and his family, and leaving behind\r\nhim on this earth the memory of a life well spent, and to his family a\r\nheritage of industry, honesty, straightforwardness and right living\r\nwhich will long be remembered by those who knew him best.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JAMES E. BEHEN.\r\n\r\nIn the compilation of the biographical department of this history of\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, the fact is frequently brought to the mind of\r\nthe reviewer that the really successful men of this county are\r\nessentially self-made, and began at the foot of the ladder of success,\r\nworking their way upward by various means, all of which were honest and\r\nbased upon hard and painstaking labor at the outset of their careers.\r\nVery few were well educated, or had been blessed with opportunities in\r\ntheir youth such as are the heritage of the youth of the present day.\r\nJames Edward Behen, successful farmer, of Center township, Atchison\r\ncounty, is one of those citizens who are deserving of credit for what\r\nthey have accomplished. Starting out as a boy of twelve, he has made his\r\nown way in the world, and after he attained manhood, with the assistance\r\nof a good and faithful helpmeet, he has accomplished results which are\r\nreally creditable. Starting with a tract of eighty acres of land in\r\n1900, which he found necessary to improve, he soon added another eighty,\r\nthen another eighty, and now has a fine farm of 240 acres, which is one\r\nof the most fertile tracts of land in the county, practically all of\r\nwhich is in cultivation. Mr. Behen has the right idea of farming,\r\ninasmuch as he sells the product of his farm “on the hoof,” and has\r\nbecome an extensive feeder of cattle and hogs. This plan insures the\r\nfertility of the soil, and his farm is steadily improving as the result\r\nof a wise method of cultivation.\r\n\r\nMr. Behen is a native son of Kansas, who was born and brought up on\r\nKansas soil, and will not admit that there is any better place under the\r\nsun for a man to acquire a fortune than right here in Atchison county,\r\nand, judging by what he has done in Kansas, the writer is prone to agree\r\nwith him. James E. Behen was born March 28, 1864, at Leavenworth, and is\r\na son of Michael and Mary Behen, who had six children. The father was of\r\nIrish descent. He followed bridge building. James, the subject of this\r\nsketch, started out to make his own way at the age of twelve years, and\r\nwent to work on the farm of Edward Whalen, in Doniphan county, Kansas,\r\nand stayed there eight years. Meanwhile, he attended the district\r\nschool, receiving a rudimentary education. He then worked as a farm hand\r\nuntil he was twenty-two years old. For several years following he rented\r\nland in Atchison and Doniphan counties. In 1900 he bought eighty acres\r\nin Center township, and five years later bought the eighty acres\r\nadjoining his farm on the west. Now he owns 240 acres, which he has\r\nimproved considerably. He built a modern barn, 32×35 feet in size, and\r\nalso built a fine cattle barn, forty feet square. He does a large\r\nfeeding business, handling a carload of cattle each year. He keeps\r\ngraded stock of all kinds on his farm.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 he was married to Lizzie Pauly, who was born March 30, 1862, in\r\nDoniphan county, Kansas. She is the daughter of John and Anna\r\n(Hartzinger) Pauly, natives of Germany. The parents were early settlers\r\nin Illinois, and moved to Doniphan county, Kansas, in 1857. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBehen have eight children: Mrs. Agnes McCibben, Atchison, Kan.; Alice,\r\ndeceased; Mary, graduate of Atchison High School, living at home;\r\nThomas, living at home; Joseph, at home; John, whereabouts unknown; Roy\r\nand Fred, living at home. Mr. Behen is a Democrat. He is a member of the\r\nRoman Catholic church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FRED HARTMAN.\r\n\r\nIt is meet that considerable space be devoted to the valiant old\r\npioneers of Kansas who assisted in the settlement of the country, and\r\nhad much to do with its development. Not all of them figured\r\nprominently, and it was given to a very few to be honored above their\r\nfellows. In the latter class the reviewer must of necessity and choice\r\nplace the late Fred Hartman, pioneer, successful farmer, Union veteran\r\nand well known public official, who for more than two decades was a well\r\nknown and highly esteemed citizen of Atchison county.\r\n\r\nFred Hartman was born in Franklin county, Indiana, December 7, 1844, a\r\nson of Jonathan and Christina (Wolking) Hartman. His paternal\r\ngrandfather was Henry Hartman, a native of Pennsylvania, of German\r\nextraction, and his wife, Alice Case, whom he married in Pennsylvania,\r\nmigrated to Indiana in the early days of the settlement of the Hoosier\r\nState. Jonathan Hartman, father of the subject, was born in Franklin\r\ncounty, Indiana, January 22, 1822, and was reared to young manhood among\r\nthe rugged hills of his native county, learning the carpenter’s trade,\r\nand then moving to Platte county, Missouri, with his family in 1846.\r\nNine years after settling in Platte county, he removed to Port William,\r\nat that time a thriving settlement on the banks of the Missouri river in\r\nAtchison county. Here he erected one of the first sawmills in Atchison\r\ncounty and the State of Kansas, and furnished all the sawed lumber for\r\nthe settlers for many miles around. The year 1856 saw the beginning of\r\nthe struggle between the Free State and pro-slavery men for possession\r\nof Kansas, and the summer of that year witnessed some lively times.\r\nHistory records the fact that a man named Bob Gibson, leader of the\r\nKickapoo Rangers, came from the headquarters of the gang with a squad of\r\nmen for the purpose of mobbing Jonathan Hartman on account of his\r\nopposition to slavery. Mr. Hartman was a man of high courage and assumed\r\na defiant attitude toward the Rangers who finally left without doing the\r\ndamage which they had boasted was their intent. About this time the\r\nnoted Pardee Butler was set afloat on a raft down the Missouri river by\r\nthe pro-slavery men of Atchison, and Butler appealed to Hartman for aid\r\nafter landing, near Port William. Mr. Hartman gave Butler every\r\nassistance possible, in getting him to his home. In 1857 Jonathan\r\nHartman sold his sawmill and settled on a farm in Mt. Pleasant township,\r\nnear the old military road which ran from Ft. Leavenworth to Denver, and\r\nthe Far Western points. Great trains of thirty or more heavily laden\r\nwagons drawn by six and twelve yoke of oxen were constantly passing the\r\nhome of the Hartmans. Mrs. Hartman recalls the great drought of 1860 and\r\nthe great snows of the following winter. During the year of the great\r\ndrought the settlers did not raise any crops and were forced to journey\r\nto Atchison for provisions, on the return trip stopping at the Andrew\r\nParnell farm for assistance in their dire need. Two of the drivers on a\r\nwagon train that terrible winter had their feet frozen, one of the men\r\nafterwards losing both feet as a result of the hardships undergone. The\r\nParnell home was a welcome and hospitable place of refuge for the\r\nstarving and suffering settlers, during that winter. Mrs. Hartman also\r\nrecalls the beautiful and inspiring sights made by the troops of United\r\nStates cavalry which were frequently seen from her home in those days.\r\n\r\nFred Hartman hearkened to the call of the Union in the second year of\r\nthe great civil conflict and enlisted in Company F, of the famous\r\nThirteenth Kansas volunteer regiment, under Captain Hayes, Major\r\nWoodworth and Colonels Bowen and Speck. He was engaged chiefly in scout\r\nduty, and was stationed at Ft. Smith and other points in the Southwest\r\nduring his term of service, which lasted for three years, and was\r\nfinally mustered out at Ft. Leavenworth in 1865. He then came home and\r\nresumed the farm work on his father’s farm. He was married January 21,\r\n1866, to Cynthia Parnell. To this union were born the following\r\nchildren: Henrietta, wife of R. H. Ripple, died in 1896; Hannah Ann,\r\nwife of James Iddings, both of whom are deceased, and who left one\r\nchild, Geneva Iddings, of Topeka, Kan.; Dora, wife of Joseph Speck, died\r\nin 1896, leaving one daughter, Dora, who lives with her grandmother;\r\nJonathan, a salesman of Kansas City; Josephine, wife of John Putman, of\r\nAtchison; May Florence, wife of Roy Trimble, sheriff of Atchison county,\r\nhas four children; Birdie, wife of Henry Barr, died in 1906; Frederick,\r\ndied in 1911, was married to Blanche Baker, daughter of Captain Baker.\r\nThe mother of these children was born January 14, 1849, in Buchanan\r\ncounty, Missouri, a daughter of Andrew and Mirah (Wilson) Parnell\r\nnatives of Kentucky and Indiana, respectively. Andrew and Mirah Parnell\r\nbegan their wedded life in Franklin county, Indiana, where they were\r\nreared and then migrated to Arkansas, and from there to Missouri in the\r\nearly forties. In 1859 the family left Buchanan county and settled in\r\nMt. Pleasant township, Atchison county, where they figured prominently\r\nin the early history of the county. The little Parnell was named after\r\nAndrew Parnell and the old town of the same name took its appellation\r\nfrom the family which settled in the neighborhood. Mr. Parnell spent his\r\nlast days in Jefferson county, Kansas, where he died in 1872. He became\r\nvery well-to-do and prospered. He was one of the original Free State men\r\nand suffered considerable loss at the hands of the Jayhawkers and border\r\nruffians. Andrew Parnell was the father of eleven children, six sons and\r\nfive daughters, and sent three of his sons to serve their country in the\r\nThirteenth Kansas regiment, one son being killed. Mrs. Hartman is the\r\nyoungest child of this large family.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Fred Hartman were married they settled on a farm near\r\nParnell, which Mrs. Hartman still owns. They developed this farm and\r\ncultivated it successfully until 1896, when they removed to Atchison,\r\nwhere Mr. Hartman died October 25, 1909. Mr. Hartman was a life-long\r\nRepublican and began taking an active part in political and civic\r\naffairs when he had attained his majority. He was elected sheriff of the\r\ncounty in the fall of 1895, and served four years in all, in this\r\nimportant office. Previous to his removal to Atchison, he had capably\r\nfilled the office of trustee of Mt. Pleasant township. He became\r\nidentified with the civic life of Atchison and served as a member of the\r\ncity council and was held in high esteem for his ability and\r\ncapabilities as a citizen. Mr. Hartman was prominent in Odd Fellow and\r\nMasonic circles during his long life in the county.\r\n\r\nFred Hartman was one of those pioneer citizens of Atchison county which\r\nare distinguished for their qualities of leadership, and his descendants\r\nare proud of his record as a citizen and public official. He was, during\r\nhis whole life, a reader and student who believed in keeping abreast of\r\nthe times and made a hobby of gathering historical data, being much\r\ninterested in the history of his adopted State. His mind remained keen\r\nto the end of his days and he will always be fondly remembered by those\r\nwho knew him. To him and his comrades who laid the foundation of the\r\nprosperous and happy community of Atchison, this volume is respectfully\r\ndedicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           OSCAR A. SIMMONS.\r\n\r\nSuccessful banking calls for qualifications somewhat different from\r\nthose required in other pursuits or professions. It calls for a keen\r\nmind, decisive action, ability to pass judgment upon a proposition and\r\nits merits, and the power to judge and gauge human nature, and determine\r\nupon the honesty or sincerity of those with whom the banker is\r\nconstantly doing business. Oscar A. Simmons, active vice-president and\r\nmanager of the First National Bank of Atchison, possesses the\r\nqualifications of a successful banker to a considerable degree. He is\r\nunquestionably one of the rising financiers of Kansas with an ever\r\nincreasing prestige in financial circles. He is one of those broad-\r\nminded men who keep abreast of progress and have the faculty of adapting\r\ntheir capabilities to the advanced needs of the times. Although a\r\ncomparatively young man, as years measure a man’s age, his experience in\r\nbanking has been such as to eminently fit him for the important position\r\nwhich he holds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _O A Simmons_\r\n]\r\n\r\nO. A. Simmons is a native of Kansas, and was born in Jefferson county\r\nFebruary 11, 1874. His father was Joshua Simmons, a native of Indiana,\r\nand his mother was Susan Pitcher Simmons, born and partly reared in\r\nMissouri. The parents of both Joshua and Susan Simmons were among the\r\npioneer settlers in Jefferson county, and it is probable that they\r\nlocated there in about 1855. Both the Simmons and Pitcher families were\r\nprominent in the affairs of Jefferson county in the early days of the\r\ncounty’s growth, and were highly respected. Joshua Simmons and Susan\r\nPitcher were married in Jefferson county. At the outbreak of the Civil\r\nwar, Joshua Simmons offered his services in behalf of the Union, and\r\nenlisted in Company A, Eleventh regiment, Kansas infantry, at the age of\r\nseventeen years, and was under the command of Colonels Moonlight and\r\nPlumb. Mr. Simmons took part in some hard campaigns during his\r\nenlistment, the Eleventh regiment being a part of the division which\r\nfought General Price’s army of invasion throughout Missouri and\r\nArkansas. On a number of occasions he showed his personal bravery in\r\nvolunteering for scout duty in the Southwest. He was mustered out at the\r\nclose of the war, returned home, and was married shortly afterward.\r\nAfter a long and successful career as a farmer and merchant, he is now\r\nliving a retired life at Brondon, Colo., at the ripe age of seventy-one\r\nyears. Eight children were born to Joshua and Susan Simmons, five of\r\nwhom are living, as follows: Mrs. J. W. Faubion, of Anthony, Kan.; Oscar\r\nA.; Mrs. P. H. Scales, of Birmingham, Ala.; W. C. and C. T. Simmons, of\r\nLos Angeles, Cal. The mother of these children departed this life in\r\n1886. She was a good wife and a kind and loving mother.\r\n\r\nO. A. Simmons attended the common and high schools of his native county\r\nand town, after which he was employed in a general store at Winchester,\r\nJefferson county, until 1899. He was then employed in charge of the\r\ngents’ furnishing department of a large department store at Leavenworth\r\nfor one year. His ambitions had always been headed toward entering the\r\nfield of banking, inasmuch as he believed that he could make a success\r\nas a banker. Opportunity naturally beckoned; he saw the need of a bank\r\nin the town of Potter, Atchison county. Taking what funds he could\r\nmuster he went to Potter and organized the Potter State Bank, serving as\r\nthe cashier of this institution for two years. He then sold his holdings\r\nin the Potter bank and organized the Exchange State Bank at Nortonville.\r\nFor a period of five years he was in charge of this flourishing bank,\r\nand here had the opportunity of demonstrating his inherent ability as a\r\nfinancier. A wider and larger field beckoned to him and he came to\r\nAtchison in 1906. Here his genius as an organizer has had full\r\nopportunity for exercise and he organized the Commercial State Bank,\r\nwhich later bought control of, and was consolidated with, the First\r\nNational of Atchison. Mr. Simmons was elected vice-president of the bank\r\nat the time of the reorganization and was installed as the bank manager.\r\nHe has since taken an active part in the organization of other banking\r\nconcerns, having organized the Farmers State Bank of Anthony, Kan., in\r\n1910, of which his brother-in-law, J. W. Faubion, is the cashier. In\r\n1901 he organized the Jarbalo State Bank at Jarbalo, Kan., of which T.\r\nJ. Mains is cashier. Mr. Simmons disposed of his interests in the\r\nJarbalo bank in 1911, and bought the Farmers State Bank at Effingham,\r\nselling control of this bank in 1912. His next venture was the purchase\r\nof the controlling interest in the State Savings Bank at Leavenworth, of\r\nwhich Mr. Mains is now the vice-president. He reorganized the Arrington\r\nState Bank at Arrington, Kan., in 1903, and is still interested in its\r\naffairs. He organized the Citizens State Bank at Elmo, Mo., in 1913, and\r\nis the principal owner of this bank, and a stockholder in the Union\r\nState Bank at McLouth, Kan. It is a noteworthy fact that every financial\r\ninstitution with which Mr. Simmons has been connected has prospered, and\r\nis in sound condition. In every bank in which he has been interested he\r\nhas displayed ability of a high order as a financier and manager.\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons has been twice married, his first wife being Margaret Mains,\r\nwhom he espoused in 1902, being a daughter of James Mains, of Oskaloosa,\r\nKan. She died in 1907. His second marriage, in 1910, was with Mary\r\nFrances, daughter of J. H. Barry, a substantial and well known citizen\r\nof Atchison (see biography of J. H. Barry). Two children have blessed\r\nthis union: John Barry, born December 17, 1911, and O. A. Simmons,\r\njunior, born March 9, 1913.\r\n\r\nFrom farmer boy to banker and capitalist in the short period of a little\r\nover forty years, with no initial capital to begin with, but a keen mind\r\nand strong body, is the gist of the career of him of whom this review is\r\nwritten. When a boy he worked for fifty cents per day in Jefferson\r\ncounty. Coming from the soil, and being reared on the farm, he has never\r\nentirely lost a love for the land itself, and is heavily interested in\r\nvarious tracts of good farm land, and owns 400 acres of Atchison county\r\nfarm land, and 700 acres in eastern Colorado, which, together with\r\nholdings in Missouri and Texas, will aggregate over 1,500 acres. His\r\nfinancial interests are varied, and in Atchison are of such nature as to\r\nbe of distinct benefit to the welfare of the city. He holds stock in\r\nseveral of the city’s leading mercantile concerns. His first work was as\r\na farm laborer at $10 per month. His commercial career practically began\r\nin a general store at Winchester, Kan., at a salary of $17 per month,\r\nand during the twenty-three years following, he has amassed a fortune of\r\nover $100,000. Yet, there are those who say that opportunity for\r\nattaining wealth and position are gone, and that a young man has no\r\nchance to succeed because of the great competition of the financial\r\ntrusts of the country. The life story of O. A. Simmons is a direct\r\ncontradiction to the wail of the pessimist, and furnishes a decided\r\ninspiration to any young fellow blessed with mentality and strength to\r\ngo and do likewise in his favorite line of endeavor. While Mr. Simmons\r\nis a stanch Republican, he does not take an active part in political\r\naffairs, and has declined political preferment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             H. B. WALTER.\r\n\r\nH. B. Walter, of Benton township, Atchison county, Kansas, is one of the\r\nmost widely known and successful live stock breeders in Kansas, and has\r\nmade a signal success as a breeder of Poland China hogs during the past\r\nten years. He first began the breeding of fine live stock in Republic\r\ncounty, Kansas, and while he has been a resident of Atchison county only\r\nsince 1909, he has become known the length and breadth of the county for\r\nhis fine live stock production. Mr. Walter did not venture in the\r\nbreeding department of specialized agriculture for the purpose of\r\nproducing show animals, but began his work purely as a commercial\r\nventure, and has succeeded even beyond his most sanguine expectations.\r\nHe is the owner of 160 acres of fine farm land, located three and one-\r\nhalf miles northwest of Effingham, on which are excellent improvements.\r\nHis farm is headquarters for supplying breeders with registered stock in\r\nall parts of the country, and he has the distinction of having developed\r\nthe world beater of big type litters, and has produced and sold a\r\nworld’s record type of Poland China swine of the big variety. For the\r\npast four years he has made the sales record for the State of Kansas in\r\nthe numbers produced and the prices obtained. His farm produces 200 head\r\nof registered Big Type Poland China swine annually, and he holds two\r\nsales each year, in the months of October and February. In February of\r\n1915, Mr. Walter sold fifty head of hogs, at an average price of sixty\r\ndollars per head, to buyers who attended the sale from all parts of the\r\nWest. In February of the preceding year he sold at his regular sale\r\nfifty head, which brought an average price of seventy dollars each. The\r\noutput of his breeding pens is shipped to points as far west as Oregon,\r\nand to places ranging from Minnesota to the Gulf States. In July of 1915\r\nhe filled an order for three high priced hogs sent in from Connecticut.\r\nHe has done no exhibiting except at the local stock shows.\r\n\r\nH. B. Walter was born on a farm in Jay county, Indiana, July 31, 1871, a\r\nson of Thomas S. and Sarah (Sherman), the former a native of Indiana,\r\nand the latter a native of Ohio. The family migrated from Indiana to\r\nRepublic county, Kansas, in 1892, and settled on a farm in that county,\r\nwhere Thomas S. still resides. H. B. received his education in the\r\npublic schools of his native county and State, and studied at Ridgeville\r\nCollege, Indiana. He prepared himself for the teaching profession, and\r\ntaught school in Indiana for one year, and taught for nine years in\r\nRepublic county, after moving to Kansas. He held the highest average\r\ngrade possible to obtain in his teacher’s certificate, and met with\r\nconsiderable success in his profession, but abandoned teaching to engage\r\nin farming, in which avocation he began with the same determination to\r\nsucceed as he had been imbued with when he began to teach. He purchased\r\na farm in Republic county, which he cultivated, later buying a place in\r\nBrown county, Kansas, which he sold in 1909, and made the purchase of\r\nhis present farm.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1895 to Fanny Kunkel, a daughter of Noah and Caroline\r\nKunkel, who were residents of Republic county, Kansas, from 1867 until\r\ntheir death. Mrs. Walter was also a teacher for eight years, and lived\r\nin Republic county over forty years. Mr. and Mrs. Walter have two living\r\nchildren: Frank, born in 1898, and Ruth, born in October, 1902.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Walter are members of the Methodist Episcopal church.\r\nPolitically, Mr. Walter is an independent voter, who is not tied to the\r\nprinciples of any political party or leader. He is a member of the\r\nCentral Protective Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HEKELNKAEMPER BROTHERS.\r\n\r\nThis firm has the distinction of operating the oldest soda and vinegar\r\nmanufactory in Kansas, which was founded by William H. Hekelnkaemper,\r\nfather of the present proprietors, in 1863. The first factory was\r\nlocated in a little shed, 14×14 feet, one door east of the A. J. Harwi\r\nhardware store on Commercial street, Atchison, Kan. Mr. Hekelnkaemper\r\noperated the business for ten years, and gradually enlarged his quarters\r\nas much as his limited means would allow, and about 1873 removed the\r\nplant to the present location on the corner of Ninth and Laramie\r\nstreets. He erected a brick structure, 22×50 feet, and also built an ice\r\nhouse. His business prospered from the start when he moved to his new\r\nlocation, and was confined to the trade in Atchison with the exception\r\nof supplying the towns within a radius of fifty miles in northeast\r\nKansas, and western Missouri. In the old days patrons drove in wagons\r\nfor a distance of fifty miles and more to purchase the products of the\r\nfactory, and many of the former patrons are still buying from the sons.\r\nAfter the founder’s death in 1881, the business was allowed to languish\r\nto some extent owing to the enforcement of the State prohibition law,\r\nfor the reason that the products of the factory, while not intoxicating,\r\nwere largely purchased by saloons. Trade naturally fell off for a time\r\nuntil conditions were adjusted to the new regime, and new demands were\r\ncreated in other retail circles than the saloon business. The plant was\r\nclosed for about a year and the widow then leased the buildings for ten\r\nyears to M. L. Greenhut, who later retired. The sons then took charge in\r\n1900, and it has since been operated by F. W. and G. A. Hekelnkaemper.\r\nThe boys had no capital to begin with, but had a wonderful amount of\r\ndetermination and perseverance which stood them in good stead and\r\nenabled them to make good. The business had to be built over again, but\r\nfortunately paid a small profit during the first years. In time other\r\nadditions were made to the plant and the capacity has been increased to\r\nover 15,000 bottle of soda water per day. This is the main product of\r\nthe factory which also produces fruit syrups and flavoring extracts of a\r\nsuperior grade and quality, in addition to fifty thousand gallons of\r\nhigh grade vinegar each year. During the busy season fourteen men are\r\nemployed and Hekelnkaemper Brothers has grown to become one of the\r\nimportant manufacturing concerns of Atchison. During the past eight\r\nyears the business has practically doubled itself over that of each\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Hekelnkaemper, Sr., was born in April of 1837, in Westphalia,\r\nGermany, and emigrated from his native land when a young man. He landed\r\nat New Orleans from a sailing vessel and then came by river boat to St.\r\nLouis where he lived for a number of years and engaged in the grocery\r\nbusiness. His store was burned and he left St. Louis and came to the\r\ntown of Rollin, Mo., where he again established a grocery store about\r\n1861. In the spring of 1863, he came to Atchison, Kan., and opened and\r\noperated the first pool and billiard room in the city. One year later he\r\ndisposed of part of his equipment and moved a part to Seneca, Kan.,\r\nwhere after operating a pool room for a time, he sold out and returned\r\nto Atchison. In about 1863 he embarked in the soda manufactory as stated\r\nin the preceding paragraph. While a resident of St. Louis, Mr.\r\nHekelnkaemper was married to Theresa Houk, who was born in St. Louis,\r\nMo., of German parents, who both died during the great cholera epidemic\r\nwhen Theresa was about three years of age. The children born to this\r\nunion are as follows: Gustave A., Frederick W.; William G., Frank V.,\r\nLaura, Edith, Emma and Anna.\r\n\r\nF. W. Hekelnkaemper was married September 17, 1901, to Pauline Ostertag,\r\na daughter of George Ostertag, one of the pioneer wagon makers of\r\nAtchison, and to this union have been born two children: Irene and\r\nLucille. He is a Democrat and is a member of the Elks, Eagles and the\r\nMoose.\r\n\r\nG. A. Hekelnkaemper is associated with F. W. in the business as above\r\nmentioned. He was married in August, 1901, to Lydia Weik, a daughter of\r\nChristian Weik, an Atchison county pioneer, and to this union have been\r\nborn two children: Marie and Louise. G. A. is a Democrat in politics.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Hekelnkaemper died August 20, 1881. He was politically allied\r\nwith the Republican party during his life, and was a member of the\r\nAtchison city council for a number of years, having been a particular\r\nand close friend and admirer of the late Senator John J. Ingalls. He was\r\none of the founders of the famous Turner Society, and was its first\r\npresident. He was prominently identified with the affairs of the society\r\nand the civic affairs of Atchison until his demise. He was a man of\r\ngreat resourcefulness which aided him in making a new start on occasions\r\nwhen everything looked darkest for his future. He had many warm friends\r\nin Atchison and was universally respected by all who knew him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CLEM P. HIGLEY.\r\n\r\nClem P. Higley, farmer and stockman of Center township, Atchison county,\r\nwas born there March 25, 1869. He is a son of Russell and Carrie\r\n(Hooper) Higley, who were the parents of nine children, as follows:\r\nWilliam, deceased; Otto, deceased; Emma Winsor, Las Vegas, N. M.; Hallie\r\nNelson, Las Vegas, N. M.; Theodore, a traveling man; Clem, the subject\r\nof this sketch; Frank, farming the old home place, and Gilbert and Mina,\r\nboth deceased. The father was born just west of New York City, January\r\n3, 1833. In his early manhood he followed the blacksmithing trade, and\r\nat the age of twenty went to Illinois, where he remained for two years.\r\nComing to Atchison county, he preëmpted 160 acres of land in section 3,\r\nCenter township, and sold it shortly afterward and bought 80 acres in\r\nsection 35, a mile east of old Pardee, Kan. He made extensive\r\nimprovements on this place and farmed it until he retired in 1895. He\r\nnow lives with his son, Clem. Russell Higley’s life did not run as\r\nsmoothly as it might seem from this account of it. In his early days in\r\nKansas the drought destroyed his crops one year. He gathered only one\r\nbushel of corn from his field that year. Having started out with no\r\ncapital, this misfortune was a serious one. He and his twin brother,\r\nRussell, worked for Pardee Butler, while he returned to Illinois. They\r\nworked for Mr. Butler all summer and in the fall of 1856 started to walk\r\nback to Illinois, so as to be home during the winter. A winter in Kansas\r\nwas a serious thing in those days, and with the best of provisions, it\r\nwas a fierce ordeal. In the spring of 1857 they returned to Kansas,\r\nhaving the confidence in this country to develop into a prosperous\r\ndistrict. Russell was a son of Francis Higley, and his mother died when\r\nhe was a very small boy. Carrie Higley, the mother of Clem, was born in\r\nTennessee in 1837. Her father was a freighter from Missouri to Santa Fe,\r\nN. M. Mrs. Higley died in 1899.\r\n\r\nClem Higley, the subject of this sketch, attended school at Pardee,\r\nKan., and when twenty-one years old, started out to work by the month. A\r\nyear later he rented a farm in Benton township, five miles south of\r\nEffingham, Kan. Then for a period of nine years he rented in Benton\r\ntownship, and the following three years rented his father’s farm and in\r\n1903 bought 105 acres. The place was not well improved and he set to\r\nwork erecting buildings, and now has a large two-story home and two\r\nbarns, one 24×50 feet and the other 40×42 feet. The latter has a cement\r\nbasement. Higley’s total holdings now number 185 acres of land. He keeps\r\ngraded stock, including fine Poland China hogs. In 1896 he was married\r\nto Margaret Hawk, who was born March 21, 1877, in Ohio. She is a\r\ndaughter of Lafayette and Hattie (Pitt) Hawk, both natives of Ohio. Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Higley have had six children born to them, the second child\r\ndying in infancy. The others are, Newell, Wilber, Morris, Marie, Dale.\r\nAll are living with their parents. Mr. Higley is a Republican and is a\r\nmember of the Christian church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WILLIAM E. HUBBARD.\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Hubbard, farmer and stockman, Kapioma township, Atchison\r\ncounty, was born September 8, 1861, in Henderson county, Illinois. He is\r\na son of Simeon and Mary Ann (Pence) Hubbard, who were the parents of\r\nthe following children: Mrs. Lillie O’Connor, widow living in Muscotah;\r\nMrs. Cora Routh, Kapioma township; Lewis, farmer, Kapioma township;\r\nWilliam, the subject of this sketch, and two children who died in\r\ninfancy. Simeon Hubbard, the father of William, was born March 10, 1840,\r\nin Indiana. He was a farmer in his young manhood, and on coming to\r\nKansas in 1874, followed the same occupation. Settling near Muscotah, he\r\nrented land for four years, and during this time saved his earnings for\r\nfuture investment. At the end of four years he had accumulated enough to\r\nbuy the farm, and he became a landowner and led a prosperous career as a\r\nfarmer. He fed stock for the market as well as grew crops. He now\r\nresides in Muscotah, Kan. The mother of William Hubbard is also living.\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Hubbard grew up on his father’s farm in Illinois and attended\r\nthe district school in Kapioma township, Atchison county. When he was of\r\nage he began farming in partnership with his father. At the age of\r\ntwenty-eight he was married and located on a rented farm near his\r\nfather’s place. He lived there until 1895, when he bought 180 acres just\r\nsouth of where he had rented. After working this place seven years, he\r\nsold it and bought the 160–acre farm which he now owns. On this place\r\nWilliam has invested a considerable sum in improvements which include a\r\nfine granary. He is a stockholder in the Grange elevator at Muscotah,\r\nKan. It should also be mentioned that William keeps graded stock on his\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 he married Martha Routh, who was born near Leavenworth, Kan., in\r\n1869. They are the parents of seven children as follows: Jesse, Atchison\r\ncounty; Mrs. Bessie Roberts, Kapioma township; Fred, Lola, Ollie, Mabel\r\nand Frank, all living at home. Mr. Hubbard is a Democrat and is now\r\nserving as a member on the school board in his district, Rose Valley,\r\nNo. 49. He is a member of the Mission church. Mr. Hubbard is a citizen\r\ninterested in the welfare of his community and is always active in any\r\nproject that will improve his neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DRENNAN L. DAWDY.\r\n\r\nDrennan L. Dawdy is a stockman first, last and always. Pedigrees and\r\nprices are his stock in trade, and to talk with Mr. Dawdy without\r\nhearing about his fine stock is impossible. Next to his family his stock\r\nis his pride. Mr. Dawdy confines his stock raising to the best strains.\r\nIt is his theory that it never pays to bring up a scrub. The same amount\r\nof feed and the same amount of care, if intelligently applied to\r\nregistered animals, will bring in double and treble returns, Mr. Dawdy\r\nbelieves, and it is his policy not to waste time on inferior breeds. Mr.\r\nDawdy has a cow that cost him $75. The former owner of the cow did not\r\nsee any marks of good blood in the animal, but Mr. Dawdy did, and he has\r\nmade $4,000 out of that one cow in the last seven years. The buying of\r\nthis cow at the price, however, was simply a very fortunate investment,\r\nas Mr. Dawdy says, generally speaking, “The highest priced cattle were\r\nmuch the best investments, and he has paid as high as $800 and $900 for\r\ncows and $1,000 for a bull. He sold one of the calves for $755 and\r\nanother for $500. He learned his business well, for he learned it in the\r\nbest way possible, from his father. The father, John W. Dawdy, was a\r\nbreeder of fine cattle in Illinois and probably inherited that trait\r\nfrom his parents, who were Kentuckians. The father was born in the blue\r\ngrass country March 30, 1840, but at the age of seven was taken by his\r\nparents, Jefferson and Elizabeth (Amos) Dawdy, to Illinois, where he\r\nremained until 1910. While he was living at Abingdon, Ill., he met Sarah\r\nJ. Latimer, to whom he was married May 7, 1847. She was a daughter of\r\nAlexandria and Julia Ann (Hart) Latimer, natives of Tennessee, and was\r\nthe mother of six children, three of whom are living. Drennan, the\r\nsubject of this sketch, is the oldest. The others are Norval M. and\r\nDaisy E., who live in California. In 1910 the parents removed to Napa,\r\nCal., where the father is now living. The mother died August 12, 1915.\r\n\r\nAfter attending the country school near his Illinois home, Drennan\r\nattended Hedding College at Abingdon and later went to business college\r\nat Chicago. But he was a natural born stockman and could not resist the\r\nlure. So he went back to his father and joined him in the livestock\r\nbusiness and became associated with his father in the breeding of\r\nShorthorn cattle under the firm name of J. W. Dawdy & Son. In the latter\r\npart of 1889 he and Walter Latimer purchased the entire herd of cattle\r\nknown as the Shannon Hill herd owned by the late Ex-Governor George W.\r\nGlick, of Atchison, Kan. This herd was the largest collection of pure\r\nBates cattle in America at that time, and were dispersed by D. L. Dawdy\r\n& Co., at auction in Kansas City, Mo., April 11–12, 1900, the ninety-one\r\nhead bringing a total of $20,460, which was considered a remarkable sale\r\nfor an entire herd, which included a number of aged cows, the general\r\naverage of the sale being $225 per head with a top price of $800 for the\r\n“Second Dutchess” of Atchison, the buyer of whom was the late W. R.\r\nNelson, of the _Kansas City Star_. Mr. Nelson bought fifteen head of\r\ncattle at this sale at an average price of $415 per head. In June of the\r\nsame year this firm bought the entire herd of Scotch and Scotch topped\r\nShorthorns of J. T. Kinmouth & Son, Columbus Junction, Iowa, paying\r\n$11,000 cash for the 100 head. This was one of the most notable private\r\ndeals in registered cattle of recent years. In 1901 they bought sixty-\r\nfive head of registered cattle in one lot. D. L. Dawdy & Co. have made\r\nmany successful sales both private and public. In 1899 Mr. Dawdy came to\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, and took charge of the George W. Glick farms,\r\nnear Atchison, Kan. This position gave him charge of a herd of\r\nregistered Shorthorns. In 1901 he bought the farm which he now owns,\r\nconsisting of 405 acres, lying one-half mile north of Arrington, Kan. On\r\nthis place he has devoted himself to the breeding of fine cattle and has\r\nmade that his principal work. His exhibits have taken high honors at the\r\nstock shows in Kansas City and Chicago. A number of years ago he bought\r\n“Sunshine,” a fine cow in the herd owned by Senator W. A. Harris, paying\r\n$225 for her. Four of her calves have brought him $1,365. He has owned\r\nthree cows which sold for $800 each, and in 1902 he sold thirty head of\r\ncattle at $266.66 each.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 1901, Mr. Dawdy married Nellie B. Prim, who was born on a\r\nfarm near Atchison, Kan., April 3, 1881. Her father, Charles S. Prim,\r\nwas a native of Tennessee, while the mother, Sophia (Christian) Prim,\r\ncame from the Isle of Man. Both parents are now dead. Mr. and Mrs. Dawdy\r\nhave four children, all of whom are living at home: Ruth, John, Helen\r\nand Glenn. Two died in infancy. Mrs. Dawdy carries her husband’s hobbies\r\ninto the domestic end of the farm. She makes a specialty of raising fine\r\nturkeys, raising the bronze variety. She sells eggs from her turkeys for\r\nfifty cents apiece, and often gets as high as $7.50 for a turkey. She\r\nsaved $150 from the sale of eggs and bought a Shorthorn calf which is\r\nworth $300 today. Mr. Dawdy is working to make his home an ideal country\r\nplace. His house is on one of the finest locations in the county. By\r\ninstalling 15,000 feet of drainage, at a cost of $1,200, he has\r\nreclaimed fifty-two acres of soil, which previous owners of the place\r\nhad thought to be too wet to cultivate, but since installing the\r\ndrainage system Mr. Dawdy has raised annually fine crops of corn and\r\nwheat on it. The Delaware has a habit of overflowing and Mr. Dawdy was\r\none of the first farmers to suggest the organization of County Drainage\r\nDistrict, Number One, comprising 8,300 acres, and is nine miles in\r\nlength as the crow flies, while the Delaware river course is at present\r\nnineteen and one-half miles, and the drainage system shortens the run\r\nseven and one-half miles, doubles the velocity of the stream and\r\nincreases its carrying capacity four and one-half times. The expense or\r\ntotal cost of the ditch will be $100,000 and will increase land values\r\ntremendously. Mr. Dawdy is one of the directors of the enterprise. Mr.\r\nDawdy owns 405½ acres of land which has a fine large residence on it.\r\nThe location is one of the most beautiful in Atchison county. On a clear\r\nday Horton, fifteen miles north, can be plainly seen; Holton looms up\r\ntwelve miles west, Muscotah, seven miles north, Valley Falls, twelve\r\nmiles southeast, Larkin, two and a half miles west, and Arrington, one-\r\nhalf mile south. Mr. Dawdy has a complete set of volumes of American\r\nherd books, and knows the pedigree of every animal on his place. He is a\r\nmember of the American Shorthorn Breeders’ Association of Chicago, and\r\nknows the latest facts about the cattle business. His home is highly\r\nimproved with silos and drainage facilities. He is a Democrat in\r\npolitics and a member of the district school board and the drainage\r\ndistrict No. 1, of Atchison county, Kansas. He belongs to the Ancient\r\nFree and Accepted Masons, of Muscotah.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN M. PRICE.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Price, deputy county treasurer, farmer and stockman, of Mt.\r\nPleasant township, Atchison county, is a native born Kansan, and son of\r\nJohn M. Price, deceased, who was one of the most distinguished members\r\nof the Kansas bar, and who practiced his profession in the city of\r\nAtchison for forty years.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Price, the father, was born in Richmond, Madison county,\r\nKentucky, in October, 1829, a son of Thomas S. and Sarah (Jarman) Price.\r\nHis paternal grandfather was Moses M. Price, and his maternal\r\ngrandfather was John Jarman. Moses M. married Catherine Broadus, and\r\nJohn Jarman married Elizabeth Broadus, the two women being distant\r\nrelatives. Moses M. Price and wife were both natives of Virginia, and\r\nremoved to Madison county, Kentucky, in the early part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, with their respective parents. After his marriage in Kentucky,\r\nMoses M. made his home in Estill county, Kentucky. He was the father of\r\nten children, the fourth of whom was Thomas M. Price, father of John M.,\r\nthe elder, and who married Sarah Jarman in 1828. Sarah (Jarman) Price\r\nwas a daughter of John and Elizabeth (Broadus) Jarman. This marriage was\r\nblessed with three children: Thomas E., John M., and Mary W. The mother\r\ndied in 1836, and in 1838 Thomas M. Price married Miss Elizabeth Combs,\r\nof Clark county, Kentucky, and the following fall removed to a home in\r\nJohnson county, Missouri. From Johnson county he removed to Pettis\r\ncounty, Missouri, and farmed there until 1845, after which he returned\r\nto Estill county, Kentucky. In 1853 Thomas S. and family started for\r\nTexas, where he resided until his demise at Mt. Pleasant, Titus county,\r\nin 1857.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Price, father of the present deputy county treasurer, returned\r\nfrom Missouri to Kentucky with his father, and remained at the home of\r\nhis uncle, Morgan M. Price, whom he assisted in his farm work, and also\r\nattended school at Irvine, the county seat of Estill county. In 1845 and\r\n1846 he was employed in a drygoods store at Irvine, and in the fall of\r\n1847 he accepted a home with Col. Walter Chiles, a prominent lawyer and\r\npolitician of Mt. Sterling, Ky., who had married Jane Price, an aunt of\r\nJohn M. Price. After attending school in the fall and winter, Mr. Price\r\nbecame a clerk in the office of the county clerk of Montgomery county,\r\nKentucky. While performing his duties in the county clerk’s office he\r\nread law in the office of Colonel Chiles and was admitted to the\r\npractice of his profession in March, 1848. He first opened a law office\r\nat Irvine, and in 1851 was elected county attorney of Estill county;\r\nreëlected in 1855, and continued to serve until July, 1858, when he\r\nresigned in order to remove to Kansas. He determined on Atchison as his\r\nfuture abiding place, and accordingly, located in this city September 1,\r\n1858.\r\n\r\nKansas was then a territory, and for forty-one years of the development\r\nof the State, Mr. Price was an important factor in promoting its\r\ninterests and welfare. He soon built up an extensive law practice in the\r\ngrowing city of the great bend on the Missouri, and took an active and\r\ninfluential part in political affairs, allying himself with the newly\r\nformed Republican party. He early identified himself with the\r\ncontrolling organization of his party, and for twenty years prior to his\r\ndemise he was a delegate to every Republican county convention, and to\r\nmany State conventions. In 1859, when Judge Otis resigned the office of\r\ncounty attorney, Mr. Price was appointed to fill the vacancy by the\r\nboard of county commissioners, and served until Kansas was admitted into\r\nthe Union, when he was nominated and elected to the office at the first\r\ngeneral election under the State constitution. In 1861 he was elected\r\npolice judge of the city and re-elected in 1862 and 1863. He was elected\r\na member of the city council in 1864 and served for three years in\r\nsuccession as a member of that body. He was elected mayor of the city\r\nwithout opposition in 1867. In the fall of 1866 he was elected State\r\nsenator from Atchison county for a two years’ term, and while serving as\r\nState senator he was appointed by Governor Crawford as one of the\r\ncommissioners to revise the general laws of the State. Mr. Price was\r\nchairman of the commission, which was composed of himself, Samuel A.\r\nRiggs, of Lawrence, and James McCahon, of Leavenworth. The revision thus\r\nmade was adopted by the legislature without much amendment, and the\r\ngeneral statutes of 1868 were printed and published during that year\r\nunder the supervision of this commission. In the same year Mr. Price was\r\nmade chairman of the judiciary committee of the senate, to which body he\r\nwas reëlected in 1870, and served during the sessions of 1871 and 1872,\r\nand on the organization of the senate, he was chosen president of the\r\nbody. He was a candidate for governor of the State before the Republican\r\nconvention in the fall of 1872, and was a leading candidate until the\r\ntenth and last ballot, when all the opposing candidates threw their\r\nsupport to Thomas A. Osborne. In the memorable contest for the United\r\nStates senatorship in 1873, Mr. Price’s friends presented him as a\r\ncandidate before the anti-Pomeroy caucus, and for the first nineteen\r\nballots Mr. Price was the leading candidate, and then John J. Ingalls\r\nwas chosen by the convention on a unanimous vote. In 1892 he was again\r\nelected to the State senate and served in the memorable sessions of 1893\r\nand 1895.\r\n\r\nOn January 10, 1854, John M. Price was married in Irvine, Ky., to Eliza\r\nJarman Park, the only daughter of Elihu and Mary Park. This marriage was\r\nblessed with the following children: Mollie F., born in Irvine, October\r\n12, 1854, married Charles B. Singleton, of Atchison, for twenty-seven\r\nyears assistant postmaster, and now bookkeeper for the Exchange National\r\nBank; Nannie B., born in Irvine August 28, 1856, wife of F. L.\r\nVandergrift, editor of the Santa Fe publications, Kansas City, Mo.; John\r\nM. died in January, 1875; John M., Jr., with whom this review is\r\ndirectly concerned, and Eliza P. The mother of these children was born\r\nin Irvine, Ky., August 22, 1832, and resides at present in Kansas City,\r\nMo.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Price, Sr., died October 19, 1898. He was one of the\r\ndistinguished Masons of Kansas. He served as the grand high priest of\r\nthe Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Kansas, and was secretary of that body:\r\nhe was president of the council of the Holy Order of High Priesthood;\r\ngrand treasurer of the Grand Council of Royal and Select Masters of the\r\nState; also president of the Kansas Masons’ Protective Association; was\r\na thirty-second degree Mason, and a member of Medina Temple, No. 31, of\r\nthe Mystic Shrine, and was also a member of Shiloh Conclave, No. 1,\r\nKnights of the Red Cross of Constantine, Knights of the Holy Sepulchre,\r\nand Knights of St. John the Evangelist.

When he came to Kansas he\r\nwas without funds, but at the end of four years he had accumulated\r\nenough to enable him to buy a farm. In addition to growing his crops he\r\nfed stock and did a hustling business in that line. He is still living\r\nand resides at Muscotah, Kan. The mother of Lewis Hubbard is also\r\nliving. Lewis Hubbard went to school in the Rose Valley district.

He died at Mscotah, Kan., September 12, 1913, and the mother\r\nof Mrs. Gibson died in 1879. She was a native of Iowa. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGibson have nine children: Daisy M. Anderson, of Muskogee, Okla., who\r\nwas graduated from the Kansas Western Business College, and later taught\r\nschool in Kansas and Colorado; Dr. Frank C. Gibson, a graduate of the\r\nPhysicians’ and Surgeons’ School of Chicago, now practicing in Bovill,\r\nIdaho, where he is surgeon for a railroad company and has charge of a\r\nhospital; Charles R., farmer, Kapioma township, Atchison county; Lucy M.\r\nIrwin, Dallas, Texas; Harry L., farmer on the home place; Ruth,\r\nattending Kansas University, Lawrence; George W., Jr., John and William,\r\nliving at home. Mr. Gibson is an independent progressive Republican. He\r\nhas held the township offices of clerk, treasurer and trustee.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FRANK J. HUNN.\r\n\r\nFrank J. Hunn has combined the activities of banker, public citizen,\r\nfarmer, and stockman, with the refinements of education, and lives today\r\nas an example of an all around man of influence. Mr. Hunn is a native\r\nKansan, having been born in Garfield township, Jackson county, Kansas,\r\nMarch 2, 1860. He comes of parentage of the sturdy pioneer type, brave,\r\nbut God-fearing. The father, Joseph Hunn, was born in 1815, of English\r\ndescent, being a son of a London minister. He was a native of\r\nConnecticut and lived there until he was of middle age. Coming to Kansas\r\nin 1857, he preëmpted a claim one mile east and a mile north of\r\nArrington, Atchison county, Kansas. Here he constructed a cabin home and\r\nlived in the rough life of the frontier. But this was not new to Joseph\r\nHunn, for he had been one of that vast army of adventurers who crossed\r\nthe western plains in “forty-nine,” to seek gold in California. For four\r\nyears he had undergone the hardships of prospecting and the rigors of\r\nKansas winters weighed less heavily on him than they did on many\r\nsettlers. After two years on the Atchison county place, he sold out and\r\nremoved to Larkin, Jackson county, Kansas, living there until 1865, when\r\nhe took possession of the farm now owned by his son, Frank J. The father\r\ndied two years later, leaving his wife, Elizabeth, with two children,\r\nFrank, and a daughter, Bessie, since married to Mr. Kathrens, a\r\nmerchant, of Arrington, Kan.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Hunn, whose maiden name was Redman, is of English and German\r\ndescent, coming from a line of religious ancestors, all of her family\r\nbeing of a devout nature. She was born in 1825, and died December 16,\r\n1912, having lived a long and useful career. After the death of her\r\nhusband she was occupied with the management of the farm, but in her\r\nyounger days she led a life full of service to others. She worked as a\r\nnurse among the sick in the early times, when medical attention was\r\nexpensive and hard to get, and her efforts saved untold suffering and\r\nexpense to many settlers. She was a school teacher in Iowa for some\r\ntime, and always took a great deal of interest in the affairs of the\r\nchurch and Sunday school. Until two years before her death Mrs. Hunn\r\ntaught a Sunday school class at the Arrington Methodist church, and,\r\nalthough she was eighty-five years old, her age never kept her away from\r\nher class. She was always on time and in her place and constantly set a\r\ngood example for younger persons.\r\n\r\nWith such persons for parents it is to be expected that Frank Hunn would\r\ndevelop into a good citizen. With the high ideals instilled in his young\r\nmind, Frank when a boy was encouraged to study hard at school, and when\r\nhe finished the graded courses at the Arrington school, he went to\r\nCampbell College, at Holton, Kan. Here he spent a short time, and at the\r\nage of twenty-two years began farming for himself. In 1893 he bought his\r\nfather’s old place and has since increased it to 250 acres. But his\r\nactivities do not stop at the limits of his farm. He has broken the\r\nisolation of the farmer and has taken an active part in affairs for the\r\ngood of the community. He is recognized as a conservative, shrewd\r\nbusiness man, and now is president of the Arrington Bank, a position of\r\ntrust and responsibility. The fact that his fellow-shareholders in the\r\nenterprise were willing to place such an honor upon him is proof of his\r\ncharacter and achievements. He takes a great deal of interest in\r\nShorthorn cattle and is recognized as a breeder of fine strains. He also\r\nkeeps graded horses and hogs.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Mr. Hunn was married to Susie Gibson. (A sketch of her brother,\r\nGeorge W. Gibson, appears elsewhere in this volume.) Mrs. Hunn was born\r\nin January, 1860, in Pennsylvania, and was a teacher in the district\r\nschool of Kapioma township before her marriage. Mr. and Mrs. Hunn are\r\nthe parents of three children, the oldest of whom is Frank, a graduate\r\nof Effingham high school, now living at home; Edna and Mildred, the\r\nother two children, also live with their parents. Mr. Hunn attends the\r\nMethodist church, although he is not a member. He is an independent\r\nvoter, preferring to cast his ballot for the man whom he thinks will\r\nmake the best official regardless of party affiliations. He has held the\r\noffice of township clerk, township trustee, and township treasurer,\r\nwhich positions he filled in a praiseworthy manner. At present Mr. Hunn\r\nis a member of the school board of Kapioma township.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            AUGUST J. WOLF.\r\n\r\nAugust J. Wolf, farmer and stockman, of Atchison county, was born\r\nOctober 17, 1862, in Doniphan county, Kansas. He is a son of Gottlieb\r\nand Joehanna Wolf, who were the parents of fourteen children, seven of\r\nwhom are living. The parents of August Wolf were born in Germany and\r\nboth grew up there and were married in the capital city. In 1860 they\r\nleft the Fatherland with their five children and came to Doniphan\r\ncounty, Kansas, where they engaged in farming. In 1880, they came to\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, and bought the farm of 240 acres which is now\r\nowned by their son, August, the subject of this sketch. Five years later\r\nthey moved to Atchison, Kan., where the father died in 1904, at the age\r\nof eighty-five years. The mother died in 1914, at the age of eighty-one.\r\nAugust Wolf grew up on his father’s farm and at the age of twenty-seven\r\nstarted out to shift for himself. He rented his father’s farm, and also\r\nhelped his father in the threshing business. While feeding a thresher he\r\nhad his right hand torn off. This, of course, disabled him greatly, but\r\nhe kept up courage and after his injury had healed engaged in threshing\r\nagain. In 1902 he bought his father’s farm, and kept up both farming and\r\nthreshing until 1905, when he gave all of his attention to farming. Just\r\nafter this a storm destroyed many of the buildings on his place and he\r\nrebuilt them better than they were before and made several additions. He\r\nnow owns 320 acres of land, seventy of which he plants in corn each\r\nyear. In 1910 he retired from active work on the farm, and his son-in-\r\nlaw, Will Graham, now has actual charge of the place. Mr. Wolf has been\r\ntwice married, his first wife being Mary Walsh, a native of Germany, to\r\nwhom he was married in 1890. No children were born to them and the wife\r\ndied in 1912. Mr. Wolf later married Dorothea Hoffman, who was born in\r\nAtchison county, April 15, 1870, and is the daughter of Frederick and\r\nKatharena (Scheu) Hoffman. Her parents are of German birth, both having\r\nleft their native country when quite young. They were married in\r\nIllinois and came to Kansas about 1860, where nine children were born to\r\nthem. Three had been born to them while they were living in Illinois.\r\nThe father engaged in farming in Center township and worked the place\r\nwhich Frank Hubbard now farms and was also a blacksmith in Atchison,\r\nKan., for a few years. He died in July, 1887, at the age of fifty-six\r\nyears. No children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Wolf, and the wife died in\r\nJuly, 1913, at the age of seventy-six years. Mr. Wolf is a Republican.\r\nHe is a member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles and belongs to the\r\nEvangelical church. Mr. Wolf has striven under the greatest\r\ndifficulties, having lost his right hand when a young man, he has been\r\nimmeasurably handicapped through the greater part of his life. This is\r\nespecially true in view of the fact that he followed farming, where, if\r\nanywhere, the use of both hands is necessary. Though it was a great\r\ndisadvantage that Mr. Wolf was placed under, he made a success of his\r\ncareer by hard work and good management.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FRANK J. WAGNER.\r\n\r\nFrank J. Wagner, farmer and stockman, of Center township, Atchison\r\ncounty, was born July 16, 1864, in Austria. He is a son of Frank J. and\r\nLouise (Frennar) Wagner, and was one of seven children, four of whom are\r\nliving. The parents were born in Austria and the father remained there\r\nuntil his death in 1870. He was a farmer and was seventy-eight years old\r\nwhen he died. In 1888 the mother left Austria and came to Atchison,\r\nKan., where she is now living. She was married a second time and this\r\nhusband is also dead. She will be seventy-six years old in August, 1916.\r\nFrank J. Wagner, the subject of this sketch, was educated in his native\r\nland and after attending the Austrian schools learned the trade of wagon\r\nmaker. Until 1884 he worked at this trade in Austria. He then immigrated\r\nto America and came to Atchison, Kan., where he worked for a lumber\r\ncompany for some time. Three years later he went to work on a farm, and\r\nafter five years he returned to Atchison and worked two years. He then\r\nrented land in Shannon township, Atchison county, and in 1905 bought 160\r\nacres in Center township. He bought this place just in time to have his\r\nbuildings torn to pieces by the storm of 1905. Most of the buildings\r\nwere blown down by the wind and it was necessary to rebuild practically\r\nall of them. In doing this he made some $5,000 worth of improvements.\r\nMr. Wagner takes a great deal of interest in the breeding of fine Poland\r\nChina hogs.\r\n\r\nHe was married to Amelia Wonder, March 5, 1890. She is a daughter of\r\nWenzel and Amelia Wonder, and was born in Austria in August, 1873. She\r\ncame to America with her mother in 1888, and later settled in Atchison\r\ncounty. Mr. and Mrs. Wagner are the parents of the following children:\r\nFrank, farming with his father; Karl, living with his father; Frances,\r\nmarried to M. Mudice; Ada, deceased: John, Albert and George, living at\r\nhome. Mr. Wagner is an independent Democrat in politics. He is a member\r\nof the Catholic church and of the Fraternal Order of Eagles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM WEHKING.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wehking, farmer and stockman, of Center township, Atchison\r\ncounty, was born in Westphalia, Germany, November 26, 1866. He is a son\r\nof Christian and Christena (Ruhe) Wehking, who were the parents of seven\r\nchildren, one of whom is dead. The parents both died in their native\r\nland. William Wehking worked in a flour-mill in Germany until 1886, when\r\nhe immigrated to America. He thought that the West offered the best\r\nopportunity to a poor boy, and came to Kansas, settling in Cummings,\r\nAtchison county. He began working on a farm at thirteen dollars a month.\r\nEight years later he rented land near Nortonville, Kan. In 1894 he\r\nbought eighty acres in Jefferson county, Kansas, where he farmed eight\r\nyears. Later, he sold this place and bought the farm of 150 acres which\r\nhe now owns. He erected a fine silo on this place and is especially\r\nprepared to raise fine stock. He has since increased his holdings to 190\r\nacres and has ventured into the dairy business fine Durham cattle and\r\nPoland China hogs in which he takes great pride. Mr. Wehking is a\r\nstockholder in a mercantile enterprise in Nortonville, Kan.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Mr. Wehking married Minnie (Giesking), who was born in Germany\r\nAugust 31, 1876. When sixteen years old she came to America and settled\r\nat Lancaster, Kan. Mr. and Mrs. Wehking have eight children: Martha,\r\nEdward, Clara, William, Alma, Ernst, Frederick and Henry, all living at\r\nhome. Mr. Wehking is an independent voter and is a member of the\r\nLutheran church. He is a shrewd business man and has been successful\r\nprimarily because of his conservative judgment in handling his business\r\nventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM HARTMAN.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hartman, prosperous farmer, of Mt. Pleasant township, Atchison\r\ncounty, was born in Platte county, Missouri, in 1851, a son of Jonathan\r\nand Christina (Wolking) Hartman, the latter a native of Hanover,\r\nGermany, and emigrated from her native land with her parents when ten\r\nyears of age, locating in Cincinnati, Ohio. Jonathan Hartman was born in\r\n1821, at Brookville, Franklin county, Indiana, and was a son of Henry\r\nHartman, who was born in Pennsylvania, and was among the first settlers\r\nof Franklin county, Indiana. In 1842 Henry left Indiana and settled in\r\nPlatte county, Missouri, and was among the early pioneers of that\r\ncounty. He died on his farm in Missouri in 1860. Jonathan, the father of\r\nWilliam, was reared to young manhood in Indiana and was married there.\r\nIn 1847, he with his wife and two children followed his father to Platte\r\ncounty, Missouri, and there followed his trade of millwright in Platte\r\nCity until 1849, when he made the overland trip to California with ox\r\nteams, remaining on the coast for two years. He made some money while in\r\nthe gold fields and returned home by way of Cape Horn, paying $500 for\r\nhis passage. Captain Fulger was in command of the ship and he lost his\r\nvessel on the coast of Central America, the vessel striking the rocks\r\nand breaking in pieces. All aboard were rescued except the first mate.\r\nThere were 500 passengers on this vessel who were compelled to wait on\r\nthe west coast for five weeks before an opportunity presented itself to\r\ncross the mountains to the eastern shore. They were eventually taken\r\nacross the mountains, but several died from the hardships they endured\r\nduring the trip. Mr. Hartman secured passage to New Orleans, and from\r\nthat city came up the Mississippi river to St. Louis, arriving there in\r\nDecember of 1850. From St. Louis the returned argonaut went to his home\r\nat Platte City. Three years later he set out with five wagons in\r\npartnership with his brother-in-law, R. D. Johnson, en route to Salt\r\nLake City, Utah. The wagons were heavily loaded with provisions,\r\ndrygoods and liquor. When the expedition arrived at the south fork of\r\nGreen river they left three wagonloads at that point and pressed onward\r\nto their destination to the north fork of the river. They traded with\r\nthe Indians and Mormons and made considerable money. Prices were\r\nfabulous in the far West in those days, flour bringing $100 per hundred\r\nweight; common work shirts sold for five dollars each, whiskey brought\r\nfive dollars per pint, and the prices of other commodities were in\r\nproportion. Returning home from this trip Mr. Hartman lived in Platte\r\nCity until 1854, and then came to Kansas with the first steam sawmill\r\never erected in Atchison county, and one of the first to be placed in\r\noperation in Kansas. He established his mill at old Port William and\r\noperated it successfully until 1857. He then came to Mt. Pleasant\r\ntownship and preëmpted a claim now known as the Howe farm which he sold\r\nfor fifty dollars. He traded his sawmill for a farm near Parnell, Kan.,\r\nnow owned by Robert Volk. Jonathan was personally acquainted with Pardee\r\nButler, and met and conversed with Butler after he had been set adrift\r\non a raft on the Missouri river by pro-slavery men. He took Butler to\r\nhis home and gave him his supper. He hid the refugee at the home of a\r\nneighbor until the next day and then accompanied him to Weston, from\r\nwhich point Mr. Butler made his way to his old home in Ohio, where he\r\nremained in safety for nine months before he returned to Kansas.\r\nJonathan Hartman was a Free State man and a Republican in politics, who\r\ntook a prominent and influential part in the affairs of his locality. He\r\nwas appointed guardian for the war widows and was selected by the Civil\r\nwar veterans of the county to distribute the money apportioned to the\r\nwar widows. On account of defective hearing, contracted as a result of\r\nan attack of mountain fever, he was not eligible for service in the\r\nUnion army, but lent his moral support to the Union. He died on the farm\r\nJanuary 24, 1897. He was the father of nine children, three of whom are\r\nliving, as follows: R. D. Hartman, born in Missouri in 1847; William\r\nHartman, the subject of this review; and Henry Hartman, born in Indiana;\r\nFrederick Hartman, former sheriff of the county; Elijah Hartman, born in\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, in 1856, and died in 1890; Alice, wife of E. N.\r\nEshom, of Atchison county.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hartman grew up on his father’s farm and was educated in the\r\ndistrict school of his neighborhood. He was married in 1883 to Florence\r\nA. Good, a daughter of Daniel Good, an early settler of Atchison county,\r\nand originally from New York State. Mr. Hartman is the owner of 140\r\nacres of very fine and productive land near old Parnell. The children of\r\nWilliam and Florence Hartman are as follows: Morris, Jonathan H.,\r\nNelson, Mariwillie, wife of H. W. Gilbert, of Horton, Kan.; and Flossie,\r\nwife of J. C. Cartmille, of Atchison county; Warren, the youngest of the\r\nfamily, was born November 11, 1901.\r\n\r\nMr. Hartman is a stanch Republican in politics, is a member of the\r\nChristian church, and is affiliated with the Independent Order of Odd\r\nFellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ROYAL BALDWIN.\r\n\r\nNear the old village of Kennekuk, in the northeast corner of Grasshopper\r\ntownship, Atchison county, Kansas, stands the old home of Maj. Royal\r\nBaldwin, Indian agent. This home was built sixty years ago by Major\r\nBaldwin and is at present the home of Mrs. Jennie L. Dollinds, the last\r\nof the race of Baldwins in Atchison county. This narrative, therefore,\r\nwill deal principally with the life career of Royal Baldwin, United\r\nStates Indian agent, who was widely known in all of northeast Kansas as\r\nMajor Baldwin.\r\n\r\nRoyal Baldwin was born in Litchfield, Conn., June 22, 1817, and was a\r\ndescendant of ancestors who came over from England in the Mayflower.\r\nThree brothers, Ira, Julius, and Thomas, landed at Plymouth Rock with\r\nthe party of Pilgrims who sought homes in the forbidding wilderness of\r\nNew England in 1620. Julius Baldwin was the founder of the family of\r\nwhich Royal Baldwin descended, and he finally settled in Connecticut,\r\nwhere Royal was born and reared to young manhood. Royal Baldwin received\r\na good education in the public schools and academy of his neighborhood\r\nin Connecticut, and when fifteen years of age he began teaching school.\r\nLater, the spirit of adventure moved him and he went to Ohio, where he\r\nbecame a boatman on the Muskingum river. While living in Ohio he married\r\nMiss Ann Campbell, who was born February 15, 1820, in Belmont county,\r\nOhio, and died July 16, 1894. She was a daughter of Joseph Campbell, of\r\nScotch parents, and who married a lady of Welsh parentage. After his\r\nmarriage Royal Baldwin settled in Meigs county, Ohio, where their three\r\nchildren were born. In 1856 Mr. Baldwin was appointed Indian agent by\r\nthe United States Government and sent to northeast Kansas to take charge\r\nof the moving of the four tribes, the Kickapoos, Sacs, Foxes and\r\nPottawatomies to their Kansas reservations. When he received his\r\nappointment he removed with his family overland to St. Joseph, Mo., and\r\nimmediately began his duties of settling the Indians on their\r\nreservations. He remained as Indian agent for twelve years and then\r\nresigned his position on account of poor health, but was again appointed\r\nand held the office for three years, after which he resigned, but was\r\nre-appointed by the Government, and died October 3, 1878, soon after the\r\nacceptance papers were sent back to Washington. Major Baldwin also\r\nconducted the Indian trading post at old Kennekuk in Grasshopper\r\ntownship. During the border ruffian days a party of Jayhawkers called at\r\nthe home of the Baldwins one night when the major was absent, and,\r\nknocking loudly upon the door, gave the information that Government\r\nauthorities had sent them to get arms and ammunition from the stores\r\nwith which to fight against General Price’s army, which was about to\r\ninvade Kansas. Jennie L. Baldwin was then a young girl of sixteen years.\r\nMrs. Baldwin met the men at the door, and by the exercise of tact and\r\ndiplomacy induced them to move on and let them alone. During his career\r\nas Indian agent Major Baldwin accumulated several hundred acres of land.\r\nHe was a shrewd trader, and during the early days before the building of\r\nthe trans-continental railroads he became interested in the freighting\r\nof goods across the plains to Denver and western points. He was a\r\nbrilliant success as an Indian agent and never had trouble with his\r\nproteges. His first interpreter was Peter Kadgue, and his second\r\ninterpreter was John Chawkickey. The old Indian mission was also built\r\nby Major Baldwin, and the old Baldwin home which he erected in 1856 is\r\nstill standing. His duties as Indian agent were arduous and exacting,\r\nbut he was equal to the emergencies which arose. He was a small, wiry\r\nman of slight build, blue-eyed and had light hair. Three children were\r\nborn to Royal Baldwin and wife, of whom two died in infancy. Jennie L.,\r\nwidow of John S. Dollinds, was born January 9, 1851, in Meigs county,\r\nOhio, and was married in 1883 to Mr. Dollinds.\r\n\r\nJohn S. Dollinds was born in New Orleans January 1, 1832, of French-\r\nSpanish parents. When he was a small boy his parents removed to\r\nPittsburgh, Pa., where he was reared to young manhood. At the outbreak\r\nof the Civil war he enlisted in Company A of the Sixty-second regiment,\r\nPennsylvania infantry, serving in the Fifth army corps and participated\r\nin many hard-fought battles, among them being the battles of the\r\nWilderness and Gettysburg. He was wounded at the battle of Antietam, but\r\nremained in the service until the close of the war, after recovering\r\nfrom his wound. After the war closed Mr. Dollinds became a river boatman\r\non the Ohio and Mississippi rivers for sixteen years, plying between\r\nPittsburgh and New Orleans. He then came to Kansas and settled in\r\nPottawatomie county. He invested in land, but never actively farmed to\r\nany extent. He was a gifted individual of great versatility of mind and\r\nwas a photographer of more than ordinary ability. He died June 1, 1914.\r\nMr. Dollinds was a member of the Odd Fellows, and of the Grand Army of\r\nthe Republic, Black Eagle Post, Horton, Kan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dollinds was formerly a member of the ladies’ aid auxiliary of the\r\ngrand army post at Horton, and was invited by the Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic to attend the National grand encampment at Washington. She is\r\nan honorary member of the Grand Army of the Republic, and had served as\r\na delegate to the grand encampment held at Pittsburgh, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DAVIS W. COLLINS.\r\n\r\nDavis W. Collins, M.D., a prominent physician, of Arrington, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas is one of the leading professional men of his town. He is\r\na Pennsylvanian, having been born in Fayette county, Pennsylvania, March\r\n9, 1875. His parents, James C. and Phoebe (Woodward) Collins, were the\r\nparents of four children, as follows: Eliza Rowland, Lane, Kan.; Effie\r\nMocherman, Wellsville, Kan.; Davis, the subject of this sketch; Roy,\r\noperator, Yale, Okla. The father was born in Ohio and spent his early\r\nyears on the farm. In 1878 he came to Kansas and settled in Franklin\r\ncounty, where he is now engaged in farming at the advanced age of\r\nseventy, an example of good health through right living. The mother was\r\nborn in Pennsylvania and lives with her husband on the farm.\r\n\r\nDr. Collins grew up on his father’s farm in Kansas and attended the\r\ndistrict school near the home place. Later, he attended the high school\r\nat Wellsville, Kan., and then took a business course at Dixon, Ill. In\r\n1894 he entered the Kansas City Medical College and was graduated from\r\nthat institution with the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1898. He was\r\nat Baldwin, Kan., a short time and then came to Arrington, where he has\r\nbuilt up a large practice by his excellent skill and high ethical\r\nstandards. He owns stock in the Arrington bank and holds considerable\r\nproperty in the vicinity of Arrington.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 he was united in marriage with Minnie Case, who was born\r\nNovember 20, 1880, in Atchison county, Kansas. She is the daughter of\r\nFrank and Anna (High) Case, early settlers of Kansas. The father was a\r\nmerchant in Arrington. Both parents are now dead. Mr. and Mrs. Collins\r\nhave two children: Claire and Carmen, both living at home. Mr. Collins\r\nis a Republican and belongs to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and\r\nModern Woodmen of America. Although he is not a church member, he is a\r\nregular attendant at church and contributes liberally to the support of\r\nreligious activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GEORGE GOODWIN.\r\n\r\nGeorge Goodwin, one of the pioneer settlers of Atchison county, and\r\nfarmer of Grasshopper township, was born in 1857, in Illinois, a son of\r\nThomas and Helen (Bevens) Goodwin, both of whom where born at Gravesend,\r\nEngland, about thirty miles from the city of London on the Thames river.\r\nThey were reared to maturity in England, there married and immigrated to\r\nAmerica, first settling in New York, where they resided for a short\r\ntime, and then made a home in Illinois. In 1860 the parents of George,\r\nwith the family, came to Kansas. For a short time they lived at Ft.\r\nLeavenworth, and then came to the city of Atchison, where Thomas Goodwin\r\nbecame a manufacturer of brick in partnership with Henry Bevens, his\r\nbrother-in-law. They made the first kiln of brick ever burned in\r\nAtchison county, and soon afterward sold the brick kiln and moved onto a\r\nfarm owned by John Russell, the banker. After working for Mr. Russell\r\nfor a few years, Thomas moved on to a farm of his own, where he spent\r\nthe remainder of his days. He became quite prominent among the early\r\npioneers of the county, was a Republican in politics, and was an Odd\r\nFellow. Seven children were born to this pioneer couple, of whom George,\r\nthe subject of this review, was the youngest.\r\n\r\nGeorge Goodwin was eighteen months of age when the family came to\r\nKansas, and he was reared in the city of Atchison and on the farm where\r\nhis parents settled. He received his education in the public schools,\r\nand is residing on his eighty acre farm in Grasshopper township. When he\r\nbecame of age he married Hester Adams, to this union have been born two\r\nchildren, namely: Thomas N. Goodwin, who is cultivating the old Goodwin\r\nhomestead, and Edmund E. died at the age of eight years. The mother of\r\nthese children was born in Iowa, a daughter of Nathan Adams, a native of\r\nNew York State, and an early settler of Iowa. He was of English\r\nparentage, and his wife was a daughter of French-Canadian parents.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Goodwin is allied with the Republican party, he prefers to\r\nvote independent of party dictation and makes up his own mind concerning\r\nthe qualifications of respective candidates regardless of their\r\npolitical qualifications. He is a member of the Knights and Ladies of\r\nSecurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         RICHARD B. CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\nRichard B. Cleveland, retired farmer and old settler, of Muscotah, Kan.,\r\nwas born December 29, 1830, in New York State. He was a son of Richard\r\nand Elizabeth (Mead) Cleveland, who left New York when Richard was a\r\nsmall boy and settled in Illinois. The Cleveland family are of English\r\ndescent and can trace their ancestry back to the settlement and colonial\r\ndays of New England. Richard, the father, was a successful merchant in\r\nNew York, who suffered considerable losses on account of an absconding\r\npartner, who left after looting the business. Richard then decided to\r\nmake a new start in the West, and again succeeded in rehabilitating his\r\nfortunes on the rich farm lands of Illinois in Cook county. When he\r\nfirst went to Illinois he was too poor to do otherwise than to rent\r\nland, but as time went on he gradually got on his feet and became a\r\nprosperous land owner.\r\n\r\nRichard B. Cleveland was reared to young manhood in Cook county,\r\nIllinois, and was married there. In 1862 he left Illinois and came to\r\nKansas with his wife and family, first living for a few years on a farm\r\nin Jackson county, north of Holton. He then bought 160 acres of land in\r\nGrasshopper township which was unimproved. Before he built his home on\r\nthis tract he lived for a time at New Eureka on the old Salt Lake trail\r\nand operated a small grocery store. All of Mr. Cleveland’s worldly goods\r\nwhen he came to Kansas in company with Isaac Gordon, an old Englishman,\r\nconsisted of a team and wagon and a few household goods. He bought 160\r\nacres of unimproved land, his mother’s watch being applied on this deal.\r\nIn 1863 he enlisted in the Second regiment, Nebraska infantry, and was\r\nengaged in fighting the Sioux Indians on the border for over nine\r\nmonths. He was mustered out of the service at Falls City, Neb., late in\r\nthe winter of 1864, at a time when a deep snow covered the ground and he\r\nhad difficulty in reaching his home after his long absence. He then took\r\na job of carrying the mail for a Government contractor named Darlington.\r\nThe route which he traveled extended from Falls City, Neb., to Indianola\r\nand Mr. Cleveland received the munificent salary of twelve dollars per\r\nmonth for carrying the mail on horseback between these two cities and\r\nfurnished his own horse. The farm which he purchased near Eureka was\r\nlocated on Straight creek, and there was plenty of timber growing on the\r\nbanks of this stream which was a favorite camping ground of the Indians\r\nof the Pottawatomie tribe. Sometimes a large band of over 100 would camp\r\nin the timber along the stream. An incident which occurred is well worth\r\nrecording. Mrs. Cleveland had a fine flock of turkeys which were running\r\nin the woods and prairies. One day she heard the sound of a gun, and\r\nlooking out of the doorway of the cabin she saw an Indian buck going\r\ntoward one of her turkeys which he had shot. This incensed her and she\r\nran toward the Indian. A neighbor woman also started toward the Indian\r\nwith a gun in her hands, ready to shoot him if it became necessary. She\r\nshook her fist at the buck, who said in explanation: “Me thought prairie\r\nchicken.” Mrs. Cleveland replied: “You thieving rascal, that was my\r\nturkey, now you get.” The Indian sulkily moved on and the Cleveland\r\nfamily feasted on turkey the next day. In the spring of 1864 the soldier\r\nreturned to his family and began building up his farm, settling down to\r\nfarm life and endeavoring to make good. He succeeded and is the owner of\r\na fine farm of rich land. By the exercise of thrift and industry he\r\naccumulated a competence and reared a fine family. Like the other\r\nfarmers of his neighborhood he had to go through the experience of the\r\n“grasshopper” years, and it is recalled that he was very skeptical of\r\nthe news of the coming of the “hoppers” when travelers and grasshopper\r\nvictims came through his country. He “pooh-poohed” the idea that the\r\n“hoppers” were coming in vast clouds and would not believe it, but he\r\nsoon had serious reason to change his mind when they came in vast swarms\r\nand ate up his crops. Mr. Cleveland was married in Lockport, Ill., to\r\nRhoda A. Perrin, who was born November 21, 1832, and departed this life\r\nJuly 11, 1907. Three children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland, as\r\nfollows: Orrin Almeron, a farmer of Atchison county; Mead Cleveland, a\r\nfarmer in Oklahoma, and Hattie, at home with her father.\r\n\r\nIn politics, Mr. Cleveland has always been a Republican of the stalwart\r\nvariety. He is a member of the Congregational church of Muscotah, and is\r\none of the highly respected citizens of his township and city, and is\r\none of the last of the old-time Indian fighters and pioneers who paved\r\nthe way in the wilderness for the thousands of settlers who have come to\r\nthis great land after him and his fellows had endured the hardships\r\nnecessary for the redemption of the unpeopled prairie. It is to such men\r\nas he that this volume of historical annals is respectfully dedicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GEORGE V. ANDERSON.\r\n\r\nGeorge V. Anderson, farmer and stockman, of Arrington, Kapioma township,\r\nAtchison county, Kansas, was born February 3, 1876, on a farm in Platte\r\ncounty, Missouri, son of Vincent and Mathelda (Pitts) Anderson. Vincent\r\nAnderson was a native of Tennessee, farmer by vocation, immigrated from\r\nTennessee to Missouri, where he became the owner of a farm, and during\r\nthe late fifties was a shipper and freighter across the plains. Vincent\r\nAnderson was married to Mathelda Pitts, and the following children were\r\nborn to this marriage: Mrs. Mary Dyer, deceased; Eliot, deceased; and\r\nGeorge V., the subject of this sketch. The mother of these children was\r\nborn April 17, 1845, in Fleming county, Kentucky, a daughter of James\r\nand Anna (Eliot) Pitts. James Pitts was a native-born Kentuckian who\r\nimmigrated to Missouri, and died at the age of seventy-four years. He\r\nbecame an extensive land owner in Missouri. A few years after the death\r\nof Vincent Anderson his widow married John H. Calvert, who is also\r\ndeceased. Mrs. Calvert, the mother of George V. Anderson, still resides\r\nin Kapioma township.\r\n\r\nGeorge V. Anderson was reared on a farm and when twenty years of age\r\nstarted to work at twenty-two dollars a month. His stepfather, John\r\nCalvert, migrated from Platte county, Missouri, to Kansas in 1883 and\r\nsettled on a farm near Muscotah, where he rented land for a few years,\r\nand in 1892 bought an eighty-acre farm in Kapioma township. He improved\r\nthis farm and erected a six-room residence which presents a good\r\nappearance. He died June 24, 1913. In 1897 George V. Anderson rented a\r\ntract of land which he cultivated for three years, saved his money in\r\nthe meantime, and made his first investment in eighty acres of land in\r\nJackson county, Kansas. He improved this tract and sold it at a good\r\nprofit in 1902. A few years later he purchased 160 acres of land in\r\nKapioma township. This tract he at once began to improve, built a house\r\nand erected a nice barn. Mr. Anderson has added to his acreage from time\r\nto time until he now owns 252 acres of well improved land. He keeps\r\nsufficient graded stock on his place to consume the grain which is\r\nraised, enabling him to market his farm products in a convenient manner\r\nand keep up the fertility of the land.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson was married in 1892 to Frances Brosig, and to this union\r\nhave been born four children: Carl, Minnie, Vernon, and Scott, all of\r\nwhom are at home with their parents. Mrs. Anderson was born August 13,\r\n1865, in Germany. She is a daughter of Carl and Theresa Anderson, who\r\nimmigrated to America when Frances was a child and settled in Kansas.\r\nMr. Anderson is a Democrat in politics, a member of the Christian\r\nchurch, and affiliated with the Modern Woodmen lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GEORGE L. BROWN.\r\n\r\nGeorge L. Brown, one of the younger members of the Atchison county bar\r\nand an able attorney, is a native of Chattanooga, Tenn. He was born\r\nMarch 25, 1890, and is a son of George T. and Mary E. (Scott) Brown. The\r\nfather was a native of Washington, D. C., born in 1860. He was reared to\r\nmanhood in the vicinity of Washington and studied civil engineering in\r\nMaryland. He came to Kansas in the capacity of civil engineer on the\r\nconstruction of the Rock Island railroad in the eighties and while there\r\nmet and married Mary E. Scott. She is a native of Doniphan county,\r\nKansas, and is a daughter of Benjamin and Frances (Helm) Scott; the\r\nformer is now deceased and the latter resides in Atchison with her\r\ndaughter. The Scott family were early settlers in Kansas, locating in\r\nDoniphan county in 1857.\r\n\r\nAfter their marriage George T. Brown and his wife located in\r\nChattanooga, Tenn., where he was engaged in business for a time when he\r\nremoved to St. Louis and was engaged in business there until the time of\r\nhis death which occurred in November, 1900. After the death of her\r\nhusband Mrs. Brown returned to Kansas with her two children, George L.,\r\nthe subject of this sketch, and Donald Scott, now aged fifteen years.\r\nMrs. Brown located in Atchison and engaged in teaching which had been\r\nher profession prior to her marriage. She is one of the most successful\r\nteachers of Atchison county and is now engaged in her work in the\r\nIngalls school, Atchison.\r\n\r\nGeorge L. attended the public schools of Atchison and was graduated from\r\nthe Atchison High School in the class of 1909. He then entered the law\r\ndepartment of Kansas University, Lawrence, Kan., and was graduated in\r\nthe class of 1914 with the degree of Bachelor of Laws. Mr. Brown did not\r\nattend the university continuously from the time that he entered until\r\nhis graduation. He was employed for a year in the meantime as clerk in\r\nthe offices of the Missouri Pacific shops at Atchison and in this way\r\nhelped pay his way through the university. He was admitted to the bar in\r\nJune, 1914, and immediately engaged in the practice of his profession\r\nwith offices at 304 Simpson building. He has a very satisfactory\r\npractice for the short time that he has been engaged in his professional\r\nwork and is recognized as a young man with considerable more than\r\nordinary ability who gives close attention to his profession.\r\nPolitically, he is a Democrat and comes from a long line of Democratic\r\nancestors. He is a member of the Presbyterian church and his fraternal\r\naffiliations are with the Phi Alpha Delta law fraternity, and the Loyal\r\nOrder of Moose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JOHN A. REYNOLDS.\r\n\r\nTime and experience have demonstrated that if an individual remain for a\r\nnumber of years in an avocation and devote his energies and mind to\r\nbecoming proficient in his particular profession he is certain to become\r\na valued citizen of his community and amass a competence. John A.\r\nReynolds, railroad engineer, is a citizen of this type, who for forty\r\nyears has been in the employ of the Missouri Pacific railroad, and has\r\narisen to become one of the substantial and well respected citizens of\r\nAtchison. Mr. Reynolds is a director of two of the most important\r\nbanking concerns of northeast Kansas and has taken a leading part in\r\ncity affairs for many years.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in a biographical sense. Mr. Reynolds was born in the city of\r\nSt Louis, Mo., June 7, 1858. a son of Thomas and Bridget (Glancy)\r\nReynolds, both of whom were natives of Roscommon county, Ireland. Thomas\r\nReynolds, after his immigration to America became wharf clerk for a\r\nnavigation company at St. Louis, where he resided until July 28, 1861,\r\nat which time he came to Atchison, Kan., and entered the employ of\r\nTheodore Barkow as bookkeeper. He remained in this position until his\r\ndemise, on April 1, 1870. The mother of John A. Reynolds died February\r\n25, 1915, at the great age of ninety-six years. It is to the everlasting\r\ncredit of John that when his father died he at once began doing his\r\nshare of supporting the family and cared tenderly for his mother until\r\nher death. Mrs. Reynolds, the widow, was left with very few resources,\r\nand John was but twelve years of age at the time. Seven children were\r\nborn to Thomas Reynolds and wife, of whom John was the only survivor at\r\nthe time of his father’s death.\r\n\r\nJohn A. Reynolds received his education in the public schools of\r\nAtchison, attended a private school, and also studied in St. Benedict’s\r\nCollege. At the age of sixteen years he entered the employ of the\r\nMissouri Pacific Railway Company as a fireman and brakeman and remained\r\nwith the railroad at Atchison until January 1, 1881, when he entered the\r\nservice of the Missouri Pacific at Sedalia, Mo., as engineer of a\r\nfreight run for a period of five years. He was then (1886) promoted to\r\nthe passenger service, in which department he has since been employed as\r\none of the most trusted and reliable engineers of the system. Mr.\r\nReynolds’ first experience as an engineer, however, was in the passenger\r\nservice of the road, and it came about in this wise: The engineer for\r\nwhom he was firing (George W. Slade) had been promised a vacation and a\r\ntrip to New York State. This promise had been made to Mr. Slade time and\r\ntime again, and at his suggestion the master mechanic of the yards\r\nplaced young Reynolds, then twenty-two years old, in charge of the\r\nengine on the run between Kansas City and Atchison, Kan. Mr. Slade took\r\nthe responsibility of any errors or mistakes that Reynolds would make,\r\nbut the young engineer ran his train successfully without mishap for a\r\nperiod of six weeks and was then promoted to the post of locomotive\r\nengineer on the freight run as stated above. Mr. Reynolds at this time\r\nis in charge of the through passenger run between Atchison and Downs,\r\nKan.\r\n\r\nMr. Reynolds was married in 1898 to Kathrine Horan, and the following\r\nchildren have blessed this happy marriage: Mary Anna, John, Kathrine,\r\nRuth, Ellen, Marselene, all of whom are at home with their parents. The\r\nmother of these children is a daughter of Michael and Anna (Dean) Horan,\r\nboth of whom were born in Tipperary, Ireland. (See biography of M. J.\r\nHoran.)\r\n\r\nMr. Reynolds is a member of the Locomotive Engineers’ Union, the Ancient\r\nOrder of United Workmen, the Elks lodge, the Fraternal Order of Eagles,\r\nand is affiliated with the Democratic party in politics. For the past\r\nsix years Mr. Reynolds has been connected with the Atchison Savings Bank\r\nand is a director of this financial concern, as well as being a\r\nstockholder of the First National Bank of Atchison. One of the finest\r\nthings which can be said of Mr. Reynolds concerning his career as a\r\nrailway engineer is that during all his long experience and constant\r\nwork he has never had a serious accident, and no passengers have been\r\nkilled or injured who were intrusted to his charge, and he has had but\r\ntwo trifling rear-end collisions to account for, which did very little\r\ndamage and resulted in no injuries to persons. This record is a\r\nremarkable one and is in keeping with the character of the man himself,\r\nwho from his earliest boyhood has known what it is to shift for himself\r\nand learned the art of being self-reliant and cool-headed in any\r\nemergency. A brother of Mr. Reynolds, Andrew by name, was a Union\r\nsoldier who served in the cavalry and was wounded, later dying at home\r\nfrom the effects of his wound. Another brother, James, was also a\r\nsoldier in the Union army.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WILLIAM SUTTER.\r\n\r\nWilliam Sutter resides on the old home place of the Sutter family in\r\nBenton township, about two miles west of Effingham. This farm is one of\r\nthe finest and best cultivated farms in Atchison county, and the\r\nresidence grounds and farm buildings are among the most attractive and\r\nbest kept in the State of Kansas. The farm is widely known as the “Maple\r\nLawn Stock Farm,” and is noted for its production of fine live stock.\r\nMr. Sutter is an able farmer, having been well schooled in the art of\r\nagriculture by his capable father. The Sutter family erected the\r\nhandsome farm residence of seven rooms in 1892, all modernized with hot\r\nand cold running water and electric lights. The barn is an immense\r\naffair and well built, in dimensions, 60×70 feet and erected with an eye\r\nto appearance as well as convenience. Mr. Sutter has long been a breeder\r\nof Percheron horses and keeps pure bred stock of this variety. He\r\ngenerally has about thirty head of horses and mules on the farm and aims\r\nto feed all of the grain which he produces to live stock on the place.\r\nHe keeps only full bred Poland China hogs and good grades of cattle.\r\nWhen the Sutter estate was apportioned among the children of the late\r\nFrederick Sutter, William received 160 acres, the home place, as his\r\nshare, and afterwards bought an additional quarter section, making 320\r\nacres in all. Which he owns. He formerly owned 160 acres south of the\r\nhome place, but sold it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE SUTTER HOMESTEAD\r\n\r\n  William A. Sutter, Owner.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWilliam Sutter was born October 18, 1856, on a farm in Walnut township,\r\na son of Frederick and Fredericka Sutter, natives of Germany, and\r\npioneer settlers in the town of old Sumner. (See biography of Fred\r\nSutter for further details.) William Sutter accompanied his parents to\r\nBenton township in 1880, and assisted his father in the accumulation of\r\nhis large estate and cared for his parents until their deaths. After his\r\nfather’s death he continued to reside on the old home place and tilled\r\nthe farm of which he is now the sole owner.\r\n\r\nHe was married October 18, 1915, to Miss Dorothy Nickle, of Muscotah,\r\nAtchison county, a daughter of William Nickle, an old resident of\r\nAtchison county. After a honeymoon trip to the Panama-Pacific Exposition\r\nand Pacific coast points extending into old Mexico, covering a period of\r\nnearly two months, Mr. and Mrs. Sutter returned to the home farm, near\r\nEffingham.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutter is a Republican in politics, is a member of the Presbyterian\r\nchurch and is affiliated with the Central Protective Association and the\r\nIndependent Order of Odd Fellows. He is truly a product of the pioneer\r\ndays in Atchison county, and in his youth knew what real hardships were\r\nand assisted in the struggle to achieve a comfortable competence for the\r\nSutter family in common, and has had the satisfaction of seeing the\r\nfamily fortunes increase as the years have passed, and seeing his home\r\ncounty improve with age and gain in prestige and wealth. He is a genial,\r\npopular gentleman, who has a deep and abiding love for the county which\r\nhe has helped to develop and is proud of the fact that he was one of\r\nthose who assisted in its upbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JAMES ISHAM HOLMES.\r\n\r\nJames Isham Holmes, of Shannon township, Atchison county, is a pioneer\r\nof eastern Kansas and western Missouri, and for seventy-three years has\r\nlived within a radius of twelve miles from Atchison. He is a native of\r\nIndiana and was born in Putnam county March 22, 1841. He is a son of\r\nWilliam and Nancy (Hartsock) Holmes, the former a native of England,\r\nborn in 1812, and the latter a native of Germany. William Holmes, the\r\nfather, immigrated from England with his parents when he was a small\r\nboy. The family located in Kentucky, where they remained but a short\r\ntime when they removed to Indiana, and in 1842 they removed to Buchanan\r\ncounty, Missouri, and located near St. Joseph. The father was a cooper\r\nand worked at his trade for a short time at Rushville, Mo., and in the\r\nspring of 1843 he settled one mile south of Dekalb, where he conducted a\r\ncooper shop for eight years. He then bought a farm three miles north of\r\nDekalb, where he followed farming for twelve years, or until 1863, when\r\nhe traded his place for a farm in Doniphan county, Kansas. Three years\r\nlater he sold his Doniphan county farm and removed to Atchison, where he\r\nspent the remainder of his life in retirement.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Nancy (Hartsock) Holmes were the parents of the following\r\nchildren: John William, Eliza Ann, Peter, Alfred; James Isham, the\r\nsubject of this sketch; John, Francis, Marion, Loma, Ann, Perry, Praeter\r\nB., Isaac, Susan Ann, Lethia Maria, Joseph, and Henry.\r\n\r\nJames Isham Holmes was reared amid the pioneer surroundings of the times\r\nand received such education as was available under the conditions, and\r\nwhen twenty-two years old went to Doniphan county, Kansas, where he\r\nworked in a flouring mill one year. He was then engaged in various\r\nvocations, including farming, cutting cordwood, railroading and\r\nlumbering, when he engaged in breaking prairie in the vicinity of\r\nAtchison. He followed that vocation for some time when he engaged in\r\nfarming in Atchison county. He sold his farm in 1868 and shortly\r\nafterwards bought another place of eighty acres, and bought more land as\r\nthe opportunity offered, and now owns a fine farm of 240 acres, where he\r\nhas resided for the past forty years. He is one of the successful\r\nfarmers of Atchison county and has prospered.\r\n\r\nMr. Holmes has been twice married. His first wife was Rose Ann Wood, to\r\nwhom he was married in 1861. She died February 9, 1862, leaving one\r\nchild, William H., who resides in Atchison. His second marriage took\r\nplace September 17, 1863, to Jemima E. Pruitt, a Missouri girl, born in\r\n1844. Three children were born to this union: Perry, a railroad man,\r\nresiding in Salt Lake City, Utah; Nancy Emily, now deceased; Minnie\r\nmarried Mr. Bisel, and is now deceased. She was the mother of three\r\nchildren, Lawrence, Milburn, and Othello.\r\n\r\nMr. Holmes has been a student of men and affairs all his life. He has\r\nread extensively during his entire life and is one of the best posted\r\nmen on general topics in Atchison county. He is a typical representative\r\nof the American pioneer who courageously conquered the wild and unbroken\r\nWest and made of it the great agricultural and commercial empire that it\r\nis. He and his accomplished wife, who has been his helpmate and\r\ncompanion for more than a half century, are now spending the sunset of\r\ntheir lives in peace and comfort in their beautiful home which their\r\nindustry has provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       EDWIN TAYLOR SHELLY, M. D.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-five years Dr. Edwin Taylor Shelly has been a successful\r\nmedical practitioner in the city of Atchison. Dr. Shelly was born in\r\nQuakertown, Pa., February 6, 1859, and is a son of William N. and Anna\r\n(Taylor) Shelly, both of whom were natives of Bucks county,\r\nPennsylvania. Rev. William N. Shelly, the father, was a United Brethren\r\nminister, whose ancestors came originally from Saxony, Germany, in 1765\r\nand settled in Montgomery county, Pennsylvania. He departed this life in\r\n1893, at the age of seventy-nine years. Mrs. Anna (Taylor) Shelly died\r\nin 1881, at the age of sixty-four years.\r\n\r\nEdwin Taylor Shelly was the only child by the second marriage of Rev.\r\nWilliam N. Shelly. He received his early education in the Quakertown\r\nhigh school and then taught school for two years. He began the study of\r\nmedicine in the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania in\r\n1878, graduating therefrom in 1881. After practicing his profession for\r\na few months in his home county Dr. Shelly removed to Eden, Kan., where\r\nhe practiced for three years. He then moved to Huron, Kan., where he\r\nremained for two years, previous to locating in Atchison in May, 1886,\r\nwhere he has since maintained offices.\r\n\r\nDr. Shelly is a member of the Missouri Valley Medical Society, the\r\nAtchison County Medical Society, the Kansas State, and the American\r\nMedical associations, and is a member of the Kansas Academy of Science\r\nand the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has\r\ntwice served as president of the Northeastern Kansas Medical\r\nAssociation. He has endeavored to keep pace with the progress made in\r\nhis life profession and has pursued post-graduate courses in the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, the Post-Graduate School of Chicago, and the\r\nSloan Maternity Hospital of New York City. Dr. Shelly has been an\r\noccasional contributor to the various medical journals, and articles\r\nfrom his pen have appeared in the _Journal of the American Medical\r\nAssociation_, the _New York Medical Record_, and other medical\r\npublications. He has always devoted himself exclusively to the practice\r\nof his profession. In politics, the Doctor is an independent Democrat,\r\nand has always taken a great deal of interest in civic and economic\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nDr. Shelly has been twice married, his first marriage occurring in 1885\r\nwith Miss Mary A. Schletzbaum, of Eden, who died in 1897, leaving two\r\nsons, namely: William L., a farmer, residing on rural route No. 1, south\r\nof Atchison, and who is a graduate of the Manhattan Agricultural\r\nCollege; Ralph A., a graduate of the engineering department of Manhattan\r\nCollege, and now employed in the Buick automobile factory at Flint,\r\nMich. His second marriage was with Miss Lillie E. Allen, of Atchison, in\r\n1899. To this union have been born two children, Esther, aged thirteen\r\nyears, and Allen Parker, seven years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           EDGAR WATSON HOWE.\r\n\r\nEdgar Watson Howe, journalist and author, was born at Treaty, Wabash\r\ncounty, Indiana, May 3, 1854, a son of Henry and Elizabeth (Irwin) Howe.\r\nIn 1857 the Howe family moved to Harrison county, Missouri, where Edgar\r\nwas educated in the common schools until twelve years of age, when he\r\nbegan working in his father’s printing office. Henry Howe, a Methodist\r\nminister, was described as a “fierce abolitionist,” and published a\r\npaper at Bethany, Mo. At the age of fourteen the strict discipline of\r\nhis erratic father became too much for the spirit of the boy and he left\r\nhome. E. W. Howe is next heard of in Golden, Colo., as editor and\r\npublisher of the _Weekly Globe_, at the age of eighteen. A year or so\r\nafterward he was connected with a paper at Falls City, Neb., where in\r\n1875 he married Miss Clara L. Frank. Five children were born to this\r\nunion, and three are living. In 1877 Mr. Howe came to Atchison, Kan.,\r\nwhere he established the _Atchison Globe_. This paper was not long in\r\nfinding its way to recognition among the newspapers of Kansas on account\r\nof the personality injected into it by its editor, and for more than\r\nthirty years it has been one of the most widely quoted publications in\r\nthe whole country. The recent edition of the Encyclopedia Brittanica\r\nrefers to it. Mr. Howe has the happy faculty of being personal in his\r\ncomments without giving offense. The informal way of dealing with\r\nmatters in his paper has always been relished by Kansans and has\r\nattracted favorable comment in the more conventional parts of the\r\ncountry. The magazines, in reproducing some of his refreshing\r\nparagraphs, have referred to “Ed” Howe as the best country-town\r\nnewspaper reporter in America. He has the faculty of seeking the points\r\noverlooked by the majority and of working them up into paragraphs having\r\na combination of sarcasm and good humor that is irresistible.\r\n\r\nMr. Howe’s first work of fiction was “The Story of a Country Town,”\r\npublished in 1882, which has been for more than a quarter of a century\r\namong the standard books of America. It has been classed by such eminent\r\ncritics as William Dean Howells as one of the ten best American novels.\r\nThis book did not run its course as the average popular novel does; its\r\nhuman interest has taken lasting hold on the public. Other works of\r\nfiction which Mr. Howe has since written are: “The Moonlight Boy,” “The\r\nMystery of the Locks,” “An Ante-mortem Statement,” “The Confession of\r\nJohn Whitlock.” His “Lay Sermons” contain a great deal of good, sound\r\nphilosophy of life, and from the pages of this book may he deducted a\r\nvery practical code of ethics. In 1900, at the time Dr. Sheldon edited\r\nthe _Daily Capital_ in Topeka for a week in the way he thought Christ\r\nwould do, Mr. Howe added to the gayety of Nations by accepting an\r\ninvitation from the _Topeka State Journal_ and running it for a week the\r\nway he thought the devil would run a newspaper.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 Mr. Howe made a long trip abroad, which resulted in “Daily Notes\r\nof a Trip Around the World,” in two volumes, which has been praised as\r\nhighly as any book of travels in recent years. Two years later he wrote\r\n“The Trip to the West Indies,” as a result of a winter cruise. His\r\nlatest book is “Country Town Sayings,” a collection of his paragraphs in\r\nthe _Atchison Globe_.\r\n\r\nMr. Howe’s country home at Atchison is one of the most carefully and\r\nartistically arranged homes in the State. It is a bungalow, overlooking\r\nwhat is said to be one of the three finest views in Kansas. It was built\r\nby its owner as a place to retire when he became old, as he believes\r\nthat too many people stand around in other people’s way. True to his\r\ninstinct of the unusual he named it “Potato Hill.” At the age of fifty-\r\nsix years he retired from active management of the _Globe_. It was\r\npredicted by those familiar with his tireless energy as a newspaper man\r\nthat he would soon be back at his desk in the _Globe_ office, but such\r\nwas not the case. After revising the “Story of a Country Town” for the\r\nstage he began the publication of _Howe’s Monthly_, which, within a few\r\nmonths became the western rival of the _Phillistine_, published at East\r\nAurora, N. Y., and is considered by many to have out-classed Elbert\r\nHubbard’s magazine. The Edward Howe paragraphs have been syndicated, and\r\nappear in the leading dailies of the country. In an attempt to account\r\nfor the popularity of these paragraphs and the other writings of Mr.\r\nHowe, Walt Mason in the _American Magazine_, says: “There is always, in\r\neverything Ed. Howe writes, the element of the unexpected. It is present\r\nin all his books—one of which ranks with the best in American fiction—\r\nand it is in his briefest paragraphs, and that is why he is inimitable.\r\nOthers may adopt his style and mannerisms, but they can’t borrow the\r\nstrange, original intelligence that eternally ignores the obvious and\r\nseizes upon the bizarre, showing how much of the bizarre there is in\r\nevery-day commonplace life.”\r\n\r\nThe personality of Mr. Howe as described by those who know him best, is\r\nthat of a quiet, courteous gentleman, amiable and kind to all. His\r\npatience in teaching the young reporter and his indulgent ignoring of\r\nthe mistakes of his office force, have been frequently remarked upon. It\r\nis said that he never discharged anyone, but always assisted them to\r\nmake good. To those who have been associated with him he is a greater\r\nman than he is to those who only know him through the printed page, and\r\nthe longer and closer the acquaintance, the more remarkable seems his\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WILLIAM F. SPEER.\r\n\r\nWilliam F. Speer showed his good judgment in coming to Kansas. It was\r\nnot his fault that he was not born in the great Sunflower State, but he\r\nimmediately recognized that the next best thing to being a native born\r\n“Jayhawker” was to spend as many years as possible in the prosperous\r\nState, and although he was only three months old at the time he has\r\nnever had occasion to reverse his judgment. In fact, he likes it better\r\nevery year, and in all the fifty-five years he has lived in Kansas he\r\nhas always held to his first preference for Kansas territory.\r\n\r\nWilliam F. Speer was born January 8, 1860, but when spring came his\r\nparents, Joseph and Mary (Fountain) Speer, whose history is written\r\nunder the name of Anna D. Speer, a sister, came to Atchison county,\r\nKansas, from their former home in Madison county, Iowa. The parents\r\nsettled on the farm which William Speer now owns and brought him up in\r\nthe way he should go, including some schooling at the district school\r\nhouse. His meagre time in school was only a breathing spell for the\r\nheavier duties which awaited him on his father’s farm, and William was\r\nearly drafted for service and had to help along with his eight brothers\r\nand sisters. When the father’s estate was divided he bought the home\r\nplace of 160 acres, which he has improved a great deal since that time.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Mr. Speer married Cora Spangler, who was born March 6, 1866, in\r\nMalden, Ill. She was the daughter of LeRoy and Lucendia (Smith)\r\nSpangler, both natives of Ohio, who came to Brown county, Kansas in\r\n1870, where they remained until 1876, when they moved to Grasshopper\r\ntownship, Atchison county. They moved to Edmond, Okla., in 1900. The\r\nfather died in 1913, at the age of seventy-four years, and the mother\r\npassed away in 1906, at the age of sixty-seven years. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nSpangler had six children, as follows: Alfred, of Marion county, Kansas;\r\nGeorge, of Edmond, Okla.; Cora, the wife of William Speer; Joseph,\r\ndeceased; Curtis and Irvin, of Kansas City, Mo. Mr. and Mrs. Speer have\r\nseven children, all of whom are living at home, with the exception of\r\nRalph, who is manager of the Muscotah farmers’ elevator. The children\r\nliving at home are: Lela, LeRoy, Lucy, Anna Belle, Frank, and Marjorie.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EDMUND BULLOCK.\r\n\r\nEdmund Bullock, late of Muscotah, Kan., was born in January, 1838, at\r\nCornwall, England, and departed this life July 27, 1892. He was a son of\r\nFrank Bullock, who with his family immigrated to Canada in 1846, and\r\ncrossed the border to become a resident of the United States in 1853,\r\nfinally settling in Wisconsin. Edmund was reared to young manhood in\r\nWisconsin, and married there in 1869. Three years later, in 1872, he and\r\nhis young wife came to Kansas, settling in Muscotah, Atchison county.\r\nEdmund Bullock was a skilled tinsmith, and his first work in Muscotah\r\nwas the opening of a small shop which served as a place to ply his\r\ntrade, and also as their home for some time. He prospered as time went\r\non and added a stock of stoves and tinware, and later established a\r\nlarger store and carried hardware of all kinds in stock. For several\r\nyears after coming to Muscotah he made all of the tinware sold from his\r\nshop. For the first five years of their residence in Muscotah the tin\r\nshop was divided and half of it served as a residence for Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBullock. A sister of Mrs. Bullock lived with them and conducted a\r\nmillinery store in the living room. Mr. Bullock first worked in\r\nGreenleaf, Kan., when he came west, and Mrs. Bullock stayed with friends\r\nin Frankfort. He heard of Muscotah and decided to locate here.\r\n\r\nMr. Bullock was married in 1869 to Miss Emma Graham, a native of\r\nWisconsin, and a daughter of Gustavus and Sarah Maria Graham, who were\r\nboth born in New York State. For fifteen years previous to her demise\r\nMrs. Bullock’s mother, Mrs. Sarah Maria Hale, made her home with her\r\ndaughter, dying September 29, 1915, at the great age of 100 years and\r\nnine months.\r\n\r\nEdmund Bullock was a Union veteran, who enlisted in 1862 in the Twenty-\r\nfifth Wisconsin regiment of volunteers and served until the close of the\r\nCivil war, participating in several hard-fought engagements with his\r\nregiment. He was affiliated with the Grand Army of the Republic and the\r\nAncient Free and Accepted Masons. He was prominent in Masonic circles\r\nand was well versed in Masonry. Politically, Mr. Bullock was a\r\nRepublican, who voted independently on local and county matters. He was\r\nreared in the Episcopalian faith, but was a liberal donator to all\r\ndenominations who sought his assistance. He was an honest, straight-\r\nforward citizen who was blessed with a jolly disposition and had a fund\r\nof anecdotes which he was continually retailing to a crowd of interested\r\nlisteners, especially children who would gather around him at times when\r\nhe was not busy and listened enthralled to his wonder tales. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Bullock lived an ideal married life and were deeply devoted to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PRESLEY H. CALVERT.\r\n\r\nPresley H. Calvert, retired farmer, of Muscotah, Kan., was born November\r\n14, 1835, in Owington, Ky., a son of B. Warren Calvert, a native of old\r\nVirginia, and a direct descendant of Cecil Calvert (Lord Baltimore), who\r\nfounded the Maryland colony in America. The mother of Presley H. Calvert\r\nwas Lucy J. Hawkins before her marriage with Warren Calvert, and was\r\nborn in Frankfort, Ky. In 1837 the Calvert family migrated from Kentucky\r\nto Platte county, Missouri, and were among the earliest pioneer settlers\r\nof that county. Being slaveholders in Kentucky they brought along the\r\nfamily slaves and improved 160 acres of land in Missouri. Both parents\r\nended their days on the old home place in Platte county.\r\n\r\nPresley H. was reared on the farm in Platte county and was educated in\r\nthe Pleasant Ridge College, the same school attended by B. P. Waggener,\r\nof Atchison. He followed farming until the outbreak of the war between\r\nthe States and then served three months in the army of General Price,\r\nbeing under the direct command of Captain Mitchell and in Steen’s\r\ndivision. He fought at the battle of Lexington, Mo., in behalf of the\r\nConfederacy and received his discharge on account of sick disability at\r\nOsceola, St. Clair county, Missouri. After his marriage in 1867 he\r\nfarmed for ten years in Platte county, Missouri, and then came to\r\nKansas, settling on a farm three miles south of Muscotah in Kapioma\r\ntownship. For the first ten years Mr. Calvert rented land and then\r\ninvested in 160 acres of good land three miles north of Muscotah in\r\nGrasshopper township. He improved this farm and resided thereon until\r\n1895. He then rented his farm and moved to Muscotah. Mr. Calvert paid\r\ntwenty dollars per acre for his land and sold it for $5,000 when he\r\nretired from active farm work. He is now making his home with Mr. and\r\nMrs. Will Warren. Mrs. Warren is his niece.\r\n\r\nMr. Calvert was married in 1867 to Miss Cora A. Jackson, born and reared\r\nin Platte county, Missouri, a daughter of Wallace Jackson, a native of\r\nKentucky and an early settler of Missouri. Two children were born to\r\nthis union: Edna and Charles, both of whom are deceased. Mrs. Calvert\r\ndied in 1908, at the age of sixty years. Mr. Calvert has been a life-\r\nlong Democrat of the old school. When a young man he formed one of the\r\nhardy army of freighters who crossed the plains to the Far West in\r\ncharge of the great overland freight trains before the advent of the\r\nrailroads. He crossed the plains on four trips to Salt Lake City and\r\nother western points in Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WILLIAM THOMAS WARREN.\r\n\r\nWilliam Thomas Warren is one of the younger generation of farmers in\r\nAtchison county, and is the owner of 320 acres of land one and one-half\r\nmiles east of Muscotah on the White Way highway. He was born December\r\n25, 1876, in Brown county, Kansas, and is a son of Rodney T. (born in\r\n1846, died March 5, 1914), and Chariet (Speaks) Warren (born in 1846).\r\nBoth parents were born and reared in Kentucky and came to Kansas in the\r\nspring of 1876 and settled on a farm in Brown county. Later, in 1905,\r\nRodney T. Warren bought a farm near Centralia in Nemaha county, and\r\nresided thereon until his demise. Mrs. Warren lives at Hiawatha, Kan.\r\n\r\nW. T. Warren was educated in the public schools of his native county and\r\nfollowed farming until 1903, when he left the farm and was employed in\r\nthe retail meat market of Mr. Zimmerman, at Hiawatha, for a period of\r\nfive years. He was then employed in the same avocation at Atchison,\r\nFalls City, Neb., and Fairbury, Neb., until October of 1911. He then\r\ncame to Muscotah and entered the employ of E. W. Allen, who conducted a\r\ngrocery and meat market. He remained with Mr. Allen until 1914, and then\r\nhe and Mrs. Warren invested their combined capital in 320 acres of land\r\nnear Muscotah.\r\n\r\nHe was married on May 22, 1912, to Miss Ella, a daughter of A. H.\r\nCalvert, grain merchant of Muscotah. (The reader is referred to the\r\nbiography of A. H. Calvert, brother of Presley H. Calvert, for further\r\ndetails concerning Mrs. Warren’s parents.) Mrs. Warren served as the\r\nassistant cashier of the Muscotah State Bank for fifteen years. Mr.\r\nWarren is a Republican in politics and attend the Congregational church,\r\nof which Mrs. Warren is a member.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WILLIAM MANGELSDORF.\r\n\r\nThe name of Mangelsdorf is indelibly linked with the story of the\r\ncommercial development of northeast Kansas and the Middle West, and the\r\nMangelsdorf family is one of the most respected and substantial of\r\nAtchison, Kan. The review of the life of William Mangelsdorf, deceased,\r\nbegins across the Atlantic in the Fatherland of Germany, where he was\r\nborn and spent part of his youth, coming to America with his parents\r\nwhen twelve years of age. William not only achieved a wonderful success\r\nin business and accumulated wealth, but he assisted in making the family\r\nname known and respected throughout a great extent of territory wherever\r\nthe output of the great seed house founded by him and his brother,\r\nAugust, carried its business. He left behind him a monument for business\r\nintegrity and upright methods which has made his name universally\r\nrespected and honored for years to come.\r\n\r\nWilliam Mangelsdorf was born in Armin, Prussia, February 15, 1845, a son\r\nof Christopher and Marie Anna Dorothy Mangelsdorf. Christopher\r\nMangelsdorf died in Germany in 1849 and his widow married Andrew\r\nStehwein, who with the family emigrated from their native land in 1849\r\nand settled on a farm in Gasconade county, Missouri. In 1868 the family\r\nremoved to Douglas county, Kansas, where they resided until the mother’s\r\ndemise, after which Mr. Stehwein came to Atchison to spend the remainder\r\nof his days with his children. Five children were born to Christopher\r\nand Marie Anna Mangelsdorf: Mrs. Anna Buhman, of Atchison, Kan.; Henry,\r\nin New Mexico; Mrs. Dorothy Beurman, Lakeview, Douglas county, Kansas;\r\nWilliam, with whom this review is directly concerned; and August,\r\nresiding in Atchison.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 William Mangelsdorf left the family home in Gasconade county,\r\nMissouri, and came to Atchison, Kan. His first employment in this city\r\nwas as a laborer in various capacities until 1872. During the four years\r\nin which he was earning his living by the hardest kind of labor he was\r\nall the time obsessed with the idea that the mercantile field of the new\r\ncountry being developed afforded opportunities to become successful for\r\nan ambitious young man. He accordingly, carefully saved his money, and\r\nwith a small capital embarked in business for himself. He was first\r\nengaged in the retail grocery business with John Ratterman under the\r\nfirm style of Ratterman & Mangelsdorf, and remained a member of the firm\r\nuntil 1875, when he disposed of his interest in the grocery business and\r\npurchased a half interest in the retail grocery conducted by his\r\nbrother, August Mangelsdorf, forming the firm of Mangelsdorf Brothers.\r\nIt was about this time that the brothers tried the experiment of adding\r\na seed department to the grocery in order to meet a growing demand for\r\nfarm and garden seeds. The experiment proved successful and the business\r\ngrew even beyond the greatest expectations of the promoters. What was\r\nintended as a side line on their part developed into an extensive\r\nbusiness which soon dwarfed the grocery trade; it was not long until\r\nthey engaged in the wholesale line; the enterprise grew to be one of the\r\nmost important in northeastern Kansas, and was later incorporated as the\r\nMangelsdorf Brothers Company. An extended mention of its development is\r\nto be found elsewhere in this publication. Not many years after the\r\npartnership of the Mangelsdorf Brothers was formed, William established\r\nanother general merchandise store at Ellinwood, Kan., in 1877, and later\r\nanother store at Bushton, Kan. The stores were conducted under the name\r\nof the Mangelsdorf Brothers Company, which was incorporated about this\r\ntime, and the other partners in the various enterprises were August\r\nMangelsdorf, of Atchison, H. D. Back, of Atchison, Kan., and C. F.\r\nStehwein, manager of the Bushton store. William resided in Ellinwood in\r\nactive management of the stores until 1895; then he removed with his\r\nfamily to his farm near there. In 1898 he moved to Bushton, taking the\r\nactive management of the store at that place. He also established a\r\nbanking business at Bushton which was successful from the start, and his\r\nactivity in commercial life continued until 1904, when he removed to\r\nAtchison, where he lived in retirement from active business pursuits\r\nuntil his demise, May 15, 1911.\r\n\r\nMr. Mangelsdorf was married August 6, 1875, to Miss Minnie Halling, and\r\nthis marriage was blessed with six children, namely: Clara, residing in\r\nPueblo, Colo.; William C., who also lives in Pueblo, Colo.; Edward F., a\r\nmember of the Mangelsdorf Brothers Company; Minnie, at home; Frank A.,\r\ncashier of the German-American State Bank of Atchison; Albert H.,\r\ncashier of the Farmers State Bank, Potter, Kan. Mrs. Mangelsdorf was\r\nborn in 1854 in Pennsylvania, and died in Atchison, Kan., in 1904. Her\r\nfather was an early settler in Kansas, and first resided in Doniphan\r\ncounty, where he preëmpted land on Independence creek, later removing to\r\nAtchison. William Mangelsdorf was a member of the Evangelical Lutheran\r\nchurch, to which denomination he was a liberal contributor. During his\r\nlife he was a hard and indefatigable worker, who was ambitious to\r\nsucceed and achieve a competence for his children. He was a liberal\r\nsupporter of local enterprises, and was regarded as one of the wealthy\r\nand substantial citizens of Kansas, and will long be regarded as one of\r\nthe leading figures of the commercial development of Atchison county and\r\ncentral Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ALBERT H. MANGELSDORF.\r\n\r\nAlbert H. Mangelsdorf, cashier of the Farmers State Bank of Potter,\r\nKan., was born February 15, 1890, in Barton county, Kansas. He is a son\r\nof the late William Mangelsdorf, a pioneer settler of Atchison, and one\r\nof the successful merchants of Kansas, extended mention of whom is given\r\nelsewhere in this volume. Mr. Mangelsdorf was educated in the common\r\nschools of Barton county, Kansas, and received his preparatory training\r\nat St. Benedict’s College, Atchison, Kan. He attended the University of\r\nKansas, class of 1912, pursuing a course in mining engineering. After\r\nthe completion of this course he was in the employ of the Newmire\r\nVanadium Company, located at Newmire, Colo., in the capacity of\r\nengineer. Later, he was in the employ of a mining firm at Weinkleman,\r\nAriz., and later with the Arizona Copper Company at Morenci, Ariz.,\r\nafter which he served as superintendent of the main building of the\r\nMangelsdorf Brothers Company at Atchison until his appointment as\r\ncashier of the Farmers State Bank of Potter, Kan., in December, 1914.\r\n\r\nMr. Mangelsdorf is a Republican in politics and is fraternally\r\naffiliated with the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, the Knights of Columbus,\r\nand is a member of the Catholic church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FRED BINKLEY.\r\n\r\nThe late Fred Binkley, of Potter, Kan., was born April 8, 1832, in\r\nWarrick county, Indiana, a son of George and Catharine (Chinn) Binkley,\r\nboth of whom were born and reared in the State of North Carolina, and\r\nwere among the earliest settlers of southwestern Indiana. George Binkley\r\nwas of German origin, and Catharine (Chinn) Binkley was of English\r\norigin. In the year 1828 George Binkley with his wife and infant son,\r\nJames, set out for Indiana, equipped with one horse, their personal\r\nbelongings and a camping outfit. The horse was used to transport their\r\noutfits and it was necessary for George and his wife to walk practically\r\nthe entire distance from North Carolina to their destination in Indiana.\r\nThey arrived in the wilderness of Indiana without mishap and at once set\r\nabout making a home in the new country. A few years later they removed\r\nto a farm in Gibson county, Indiana, where George and Catharine Binkley\r\nspent the remainder of their lives. They reared a family of eleven\r\nchildren, of which Fred was the third child.\r\n\r\nFred Binkley grew to manhood on the pioneer farm in Indiana and learned\r\nto rough it at a very early age. After his marriage in 1854 to Elizabeth\r\nDougan, he and his wife lived for one year on a farm in Gibson county,\r\nand then the father of Mrs. Binkley (James Dougan) sold out his holdings\r\nin Indiana and migrated to Atchison county, Kansas. Two years later Fred\r\nand his wife followed and settled on 160 acres of land one and one-half\r\nmiles northwest of Potter in Mt. Pleasant township. The land was mostly\r\nraw prairie and it was necessary for him to erect a suitable home which\r\nwas an humble one at first, but as the years passed and Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBinkley became more and more prosperous they built a better home and\r\nadded sixty acres more land to their holdings.\r\n\r\nFred Binkley was married September 15, 1854, to Elizabeth Dougan, and\r\neight children have been born to this union: Robert, born in Indiana in\r\n1855, a farmer living in Mt. Pleasant township; Sarah, wife of S.\r\nWatson, of Leavenworth county, Kansas, was born in 1860; Lewis, born in\r\n1863, and died in 1899; James, born in 1868, living on a farm near\r\nEffingham, Kan.; George, born in 1870, died in 1910; Dora, born in 1872,\r\nwife of Samuel Hall, of Leavenworth county, Kansas; Lou, born in 1874,\r\nat home with her mother; Kate, born in 1877, wife of Albert Hawley, of\r\nAtchison county, Kansas. The mother of these children was born May 10,\r\n1835, a daughter of James and Sarah (Healt) Dougan. James Dougan, the\r\nfather, was born in Kentucky, a son of Samuel, who was a soldier of the\r\nRevolution, and who received a large grant of Government land for his\r\nservices. His grant was located in Dyer county, Tennessee, and consisted\r\nof 1,300 acres of wild land, which was divided among the children of the\r\nRevolutionary soldier (James). Samuel removed with his family to a\r\nportion of this land, which was wild and rough and covered with dense\r\ntimber. A few years of living in the wilderness of Tennessee sufficed\r\nfor them, however, and they left the State and went to Gibson county,\r\nIndiana, to found another home. They traveled horseback to the new\r\nlocation. Samuel, at that time an old man, became ill on the trip and\r\nwas forced to return to Tennessee, dying there in about 1828. The family\r\nlater made a permanent settlement in Gibson county, Indiana. Samuel and\r\nMolly Dougan (his wife) reared a family of five children, of whom James,\r\nthe father of Mrs. Binkley, was the third child. The mother of James\r\ndied in 1845. James Dougan was married in 1831 to Sarah Healt, and\r\neleven children were born to them, of whom nine were reared to manhood\r\nand womanhood. As early as 1855 James Dougan came to Atchison county and\r\npreëmpted 160 acres of land, built a cabin, and returned to Indiana for\r\nhis family, whom he brought to Atchison county, Kansas, in the spring of\r\n1856. He was comparatively a poor man when he located in Kansas, but\r\nbecame quite prosperous and well-to-do and became the owner of a half\r\nsection of well improved land. James died in 1900, at the age of ninety-\r\ntwo years. Two brothers of Mrs. Binkley served in the Union Army during\r\nthe Civil war. One of them enlisted in the Eighth Kansas cavalry\r\nregiment, and the other in the Thirteenth regiment.\r\n\r\nFred Binkley departed this life August 2, 1910. He was well and\r\nfavorably known in Atchison county and his demise marked the passing of\r\none of the sturdy pioneer settlers of the State. He was a stanch\r\nRepublican during his whole life and was a pronounced Free State man in\r\nthe days when the struggle was on to make Kansas a Free State. He took\r\nan active part in the stirring scenes before and during the dark days of\r\nthe Civil war, and like many others, suffered from the forays of the\r\nborder ruffians. The Methodist church, of which he was one of the\r\nmembers and a builder, having been burned by border ruffians, he never\r\nunited with any other denomination.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOHN DRIMMEL.\r\n\r\nJohn Drimmel, farmer and stockman, of Shannon township, Atchison county,\r\nwas born on the farm where he resides, in 1863, a son of John and Mary\r\n(Karn) Drimmel, natives of Austria. John Drimmel, Sr., was born in\r\nAustria in 1829, and immigrated to America with his wife in 1853. They\r\nwere accompanied by the oldest child, Veronica. He settled on a rented\r\nfarm of eighty acres north of Atchison in Shannon township, which he\r\ncultivated for three years and then bought eighty acres of land four\r\nmiles west of the city. John, Sr., erected a small, rough box house,\r\nwhich was the family home for the first twelve years, and which was then\r\nreplaced by a large, handsome brick residence of ten rooms, which is now\r\nthe home of the son, John. This fine home is modern and fitted with a\r\nlighting system and a cellar runs underneath the entire body of the\r\nhouse. It is one of the most attractive places in Atchison county. Mr.\r\nDrimmel added to his acreage as he was able and accumulated a total of\r\n230 acres of fine land which is now being cultivated by his son. During\r\n1914 John Drimmel, with whom this review is concerned, had planted\r\nforty-five acres of corn, 100 acres of wheat, and ninety acres of oats,\r\nall of which yielded splendid crops. Mr. Drimmel is renting eighty\r\nacres, in addition to the home farm. The elder Drimmel was a Free State\r\nman and served as company cook in the Union army during the Civil war.\r\nHe reared a family of seven children, as follows: Mrs. Veronica Miller,\r\nliving in Doniphan county, Kansas; Antony, of Atchison; Florence,\r\nEverest, Kan.; John, the subject of this review; Arnold, of Kansas City;\r\nFrank, living with his brother, John; L. J., a farmer, living in Shannon\r\ntownship. All of the children of this pioneer family are well-to-do and\r\nin good health, the oldest of the family being over sixty-one years of\r\nage. John Drimmel, the father, died in 1891. The mother was born in\r\n1829, and died in 1889. They were a worthy pioneer couple who achieved a\r\ncomfortable competence and reared a fine family in the land of their\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nJohn Drimmel owns and manages the old home place of the Drimmel family\r\nin Shannon township, and is one of the representative and well known\r\nfarmers of Atchison county. All of his fifty-three years of life have\r\nbeen spent in Atchison county and he has always lived on the farm which\r\nhe now owns. Mr. Drimmel was married in 1893 to Miss Marie Blodig, who\r\ndied in the first year of her marriage, leaving one son, Frank, born\r\nMarch 1, 1894, and studied in St. Benedict’s College. He was again\r\nmarried in 1896 to Miss Marie Jahl, who has borne him the following\r\nchildren: Anna Marie, born November 24, 1898; John Albert, born April\r\n28, 1900; Marie Veronica, born September 6, 1901; Agnes Cecila, born\r\nDecember 23, 1902; Irene Florentine, born June 11, 1904; Ernest Gabriel,\r\nborn January 15, 1906; Alfred William, born March 28, 1908; Reinhold\r\nLeapold, born September 20, 1909; Rose Helena, born January 23, 1911;\r\nMaximilian Louis, born August 21, 1912; Genevieve Frances, born August\r\n14, 1914. The mother of this large family of eleven children was born in\r\nAustria in 1877, a daughter of John and Anna Jahl. John Jahl, the father\r\nof Mrs. Drimmel, was born in Austria in 1852, and departed this life\r\nMarch 10, 1879. Mrs. Jahl was born July 22, 1855, and came to America in\r\nthe year 1894, and has since resided in Atchison county. Mrs. Jahl\r\nresides with her daughter. She and Mr. Jahl were married in Austria in\r\n1875 and were the parents of three children as follows: John Jahl, Jr.,\r\nborn February 21, 1876, and died in October, 1877; Mrs. Marie (Jahl)\r\nDrimmel, born March 10, 1877; Frank Jahl, born September 17, 1878, and\r\ndied in June of 1879.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Drimmel and their children are all members of St.\r\nBenedict’s Catholic Church and are liberal supporters of this\r\ndenomination. Mr. Drimmel is a Democrat in politics, but simply does his\r\nduty as a citizen and has never been a seeker after political office.\r\nThe Drimmel home is a very happy one, and the Drimmel family is one of\r\nthe largest families in Atchison county or the state of Kansas, and Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Drimmel have good and just right to be proud of the fact,\r\ninasmuch as Atchison county is proud of them. The children of this fine\r\nfamily are all receiving the benefits of a good school and college\r\neducation, and it is the firm intention of the parents that all of their\r\nsons shall be educated in St. Benedict’s College, and the daughters\r\nshall finish their training in Mt. St. Scholastica Academy. John, Jr.,\r\nis at present a student in St. Benedict’s College, class of 1917, and\r\nAnna and Marie will enter Mt. Scholastica in the fall of 1916 in order\r\nto complete the course in this excellent young ladies’ school. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Drimmel believe thoroughly in giving their children every\r\neducational advantage within their means in order to properly fit them\r\nfor becoming useful men and women and become a credit to their ambitious\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AUGUST MANGELSDORF.\r\n\r\nAugust Mangelsdorf has been a citizen of Atchison for over half a\r\ncentury and has accomplished during that period two things which entitle\r\nhim to recognition and even renown. He established and built up the\r\nMangelsdorf Brothers Seed Company, one of the largest concerns of its\r\nkind in the West, and now managed by his sons. The other is the rearing\r\nof a large family of fifteen children. If Mr. Mangelsdorf had done no\r\nmore than to bring into the world and rear his family of fifteen\r\nchildren he would have been entitled to more than ordinary mention as\r\none of the sturdy pioneer citizens of Atchison. He is now living a\r\nretired life at his beautiful place, “Homewood,” in South Atchison, and,\r\nwhile ostensibly retired, works constantly on his farm within and\r\nadjoining the city limits. While nominally the president of the\r\nMangelsdorf Brothers Seed Company, he spends the greater portion of his\r\ntime out of doors working about the grounds and fields of his estate.\r\nMr. Mangelsdorf, while having lived a busy and even strenuous life\r\nduring his fifty years in business in Atchison, has no desire to “rust\r\nout,” but believes that his health can be better conserved by plenty of\r\nexercise in the open air. His rugged appearance and keen interest in\r\nlife bear testimony to the wisdom of his plan of living. He is one of\r\nthe highly respected and substantial citizens of Atchison and has done\r\nhis part in the task of making Atchison preëminent among the cities of\r\nthe West. The great concern which bears his name was originated and\r\nbuilt up by himself and is a monument to his enterprise and integrity,\r\nand Atchison is proud of him and the outcome of his life work.\r\n\r\nMr. Mangelsdorf was born in Armin, Prussia, July 27, 1848. He was the\r\nson of Christopher and Marie Anna Dorothy Mangelsdorf, who lived in\r\nArmin until 1856, when they immigrated to America. The father died in\r\n1849, and the mother married the second time to Andrew Stehwein. The\r\nfamily first settled on a farm in Gasconade county, Missouri, residing\r\nthere until 1868, when they came to Douglas county, Kansas. Here they\r\nlived until the mother died, and then Mr. Stehwein came to Atchison to\r\nspend the remainder of his days with his children. Five children were\r\nborn to Christopher Mangelsdorf, namely: Mrs. Anna Buhrman, of Atchison;\r\nHenry, in New Mexico; Mrs. Dorothy Beurman, Lakeview, Douglas county,\r\nKansas; William, deceased August, with whom this review is directly\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nAugust Mangelsdorf came to Kansas from Missouri in 1865 and located in\r\nAtchison. He worked as a laborer to earn money for his sustenance and\r\nwas not ashamed to do the hardest kind of labor. He willingly did\r\nanything necessary to earn an honest dollar. His first real business\r\nexperience was as a clerk in the grocery store of John Belz. It was only\r\nnatural to see him become the owner of the business in time. Frugality,\r\nindustry and aptitude, characteristics of his race, enabled him to\r\nbecome proprietor of the store in 1873. He owned the business until\r\n1893. Two years after taking entire charge of the grocery he started a\r\nsmall seed business as a side line with his grocery. This was the\r\nfoundation of his subsequent fortune, and it was only a question of\r\nyears until he branched out in the wholesale line and the business\r\noutgrew the store. The seed business kept on growing and growing: the\r\nsons of its founder became young men; its founder concluded to retire\r\nand he turned over the management to his sons who are following in the\r\nfather’s footsteps. For years his brother, William, was associated with\r\nhim and they started a general store at Ellinwood, Kan., of which\r\nWilliam had charge. Mr. Mangelsdorf established greenhouses in\r\nconnection with the seed business. These extensive greenhouses are\r\nlocated on the Homewood estate and are in charge of his son, Ernest. In\r\n1912 Mr. Mangelsdorf concluded to retire from active business and is now\r\nenjoying life to the full. His sixty-seven years of existence have been\r\nwell and profitably spent and he can look back over the past years with\r\nsatisfaction and pleasure over a task well and faithfully done. It is\r\ngiven to but few men to have reared a large family of sons and daughters\r\nand to have lived to see them shoulder the responsibilities left by the\r\nfather and perform the work successfully while he is yet living to\r\nobserve, guide, and instruct them.\r\n\r\nMr. Mangelsdorf was first married to Anna Charlotte Brune in 1874. She\r\ndied in 1890. To this union were born nine children: Anna died in 1890;\r\nAugust, manager and vice-president of the seed company; Fred, the\r\nefficient secretary of the concern; Charlotte, cashier of the company;\r\nErnest, in charge of the greenhouses; Bertha, teacher of domestic\r\nscience in the high school at Seneca, Kan.; Caroline, who is studying in\r\nChicago in preparation for kindergarten work; Marie, deceased; Frank,\r\ntreasurer of the seed company; Mrs. Marie Schmeling, of Atchison. In\r\n1892 Mr. Mangelsdorf took to wife, Mrs. Louise Brune, who has borne him\r\neight children: Albert, a graduate of the Agricultural College at\r\nManhattan, class of 1916; Carl died in infancy; Paul and Louise, in high\r\nschool; Theodore, Dorothy, Harold and Helen.\r\n\r\nMr. Mangelsdorf is a director of the First National Bank of Atchison.\r\nPolitically, he is allied with the Democratic party and has served one\r\nterm as city councilman and city treasurer for four years. He is a\r\nmember of the Evangelical church and is fraternally allied with the\r\nBenevolent and Protective Order of Elks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FRANK A. MANGELSDORF.\r\n\r\nFrank A. Mangelsdorf, cashier of the German-American State Bank of\r\nAtchison, Kan., while the youngest of the bankers of the city, has given\r\nevidence that he possesses the inherent ability and the necessary\r\nambition to successfully conduct the important financial institution\r\nunder his management. The German-American State Bank is the newest of\r\nthe banking concerns of Atchison, but it is fast coming to the front as\r\none of the important banks of this section of Kansas under Mr.\r\nMangelsdorf’s aggressive and capable control. He is a native son of\r\nKansas and was born and reared in this State, being a son of William\r\nMangelsdorf, merchant and financier, deceased, who came from Germany to\r\nAmerica when a boy and achieved a notable success in the land of his\r\nadoption. A review of the life of William Mangelsdorf appears in this\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nMr. Mangelsdorf was born August 14, 1888, in Ellinwood, Kan. The first\r\nten years of his life were spent there and on his father’s farm, whither\r\nhis parents had removed from Ellinwood. He received his early education\r\nin a country school, later attending the public schools of Bushton, and\r\ncompleted the eighth grade at the age of twelve. From 1900 to 1904 he\r\nwas employed in his father’s store at Bushton, the family removing to\r\nthe city of Atchison in the latter year. He pursued a course in the\r\nAtchison Business College, and then became cashier of the Mangelsdorf\r\nBrothers Company, a position which he filled until 1910. He then became\r\nassistant cashier of the First National Bank of Atchison, remaining in\r\nthat position until the organization of the German-American State Bank\r\nin 1912, when he became cashier of the newly organized banking concern.\r\nThe success of this bank is a matter of gratification to its\r\nstockholders and patrons.\r\n\r\nMr. Mangelsdorf was married June 22, 1914, to Miss Veva Sawin, a\r\ndaughter of William H. Sawin, an undertaker of Atchison. He is\r\nindependent in political matters, preferring to cast his vote for the\r\nindividual whom he deems best fitted to perform the duties of the office\r\nsought rather than to support a party candidate. He is a member of the\r\nCatholic church. Although young in years, Mr. Mangelsdorf is recognized\r\nas one of the rising young bankers of Atchison and is considered among\r\nthe city’s best and most enterprising citizens. The unvarying courtesy\r\nand dignity characteristic in his conduct of the banking business is\r\ncarried into his daily life, and he enjoys the respect and esteem of a\r\nlarge number of friends in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PAUL ATKIN.\r\n\r\nPaul Atkin, traveling salesman, of Atchison, Kan., was born September 6,\r\n1866, in Lincolnshire, England. He was the son of William and Rebecca\r\n(Prestwood) Atkin. William Atkin, the father, was born in England about\r\n1841. He was a farmer in his native country, but emigrated from England\r\nto America in 1872. His first place of residence in this country was in\r\nChicago, where he resided a few years. He then moved to Kansas, settling\r\non his farm in Doniphan county. After one year’s residence in Kansas he\r\nreturned to Chicago and engaged in the transfer business. Again, in\r\nabout 1880, he returned to Doniphan county, Kansas, and engaged in\r\nfarming, and cultivated his land until 1899, at which time he engaged in\r\nthe hotel and livery business in Denton, Kansas. He died in a hospital\r\nat Leavenworth, Kan., in 1900. Nine children were born to William and\r\nRebecca Atkin: Mrs. L. H. Priester, living in California; Paul, with\r\nwhom this review is directly concerned; Mrs. Thomas Wrighter, of Denton,\r\nKan.; Mrs. Fred Hickok, of Haverlock, Neb.; Mrs. Ben Hinchscliff, near\r\nTopeka, Kan.; Mrs. Art Hall, Severance, Kan.; William, farmer, of\r\nDoniphan county; Arnold, near Severance, Kan.; Ethel died at the age of\r\neight years. The mother of these children was born in England in 1842,\r\nand died in Severance, Kan., in 1902.\r\n\r\nPaul Atkin did not leave England until thirteen years of age, when he\r\ncrossed the ocean and continent and came to Atchison, Kan., arriving in\r\nthe city ten days before his parents, then living in Doniphan county,\r\nKansas, learned of his arrival. He was nine days on the water and came\r\nacross the ocean aboard the “City of Richmond,” one of the fastest\r\nocean-going passenger ships afloat at that time. Being a boy and alone,\r\nhe was given all privileges and made many friends. He never had a day’s\r\nillness during the voyage or crossing the continent to Kansas, but\r\nbecame ill on arriving in Atchison and was cared for by Mr. Dorethy, at\r\nthat time depot master of Atchison. This kind man looked after him until\r\nhis father was notified of his arrival. From Atchison he went to\r\nDoniphan county and assisted his father for many years in operating the\r\nfarm, later operating the farm by himself for one year. At the age of\r\ntwenty he began working for himself for twenty dollars per month for a\r\nperiod of one year. He then went to Ellensburg, Wash., and learned the\r\nplasterer’s trade, remaining in that city two years, after which he went\r\nto Tacoma, Wash., and remained there six months, then going to Portland,\r\nOre., where he worked at the harness maker’s trade, not long after\r\nreturning to Doniphan county, Kansas, where he followed the trade of\r\nplastering for three years. After his marriage he made his home in\r\nAtchison, Kan., and after making a trip to Port Arthur and working at\r\nhis trade, he then opened a meat market in Denton, Kan., which he\r\noperated for a time and then sold out. In 1888 he returned to Atchison\r\nand entered the employ of Curtain & Clark Cutlery Company, of St.\r\nJoseph, Mo., as traveling salesman. He traveled for three years, his\r\nterritory being through Nebraska. He resigned and accepted a position\r\nfor another three and a half years with the Rochester Stamp Company, of\r\nRochester, N. Y. Giving up this work he engaged in the hardware business\r\nwith Krings in Atchison. The firm was known as Krings & Atkin. Later he\r\nsold out his interest in the hardware business and became interested in\r\nthe United States Street Lighting Company, manufacturing street lamps in\r\nKansas City until February, 1909, when he again went on the road as\r\ntraveling salesman with the Associated Silver Company of Chicago, his\r\nterritory embracing Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado.\r\n\r\nMr. Atkin was married in 1894 to Addie M. Herring. Mr. and Mrs. Atkin\r\nhave one daughter, Frances Mildred, a graduate of Atchison High School,\r\nand a student in Atchison Business College.\r\n\r\nMrs. Atkin was born in 1871 in Doniphan county, Kansas, a daughter of\r\nHenry H. Herring, a native of Pennsylvania and now residing in Atchison.\r\n\r\nMr. Atkin is independent in political affairs and votes for the\r\nindividual rather than the support of any one political party. He is\r\naffiliated with the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons. His wife and\r\ndaughter are members of the Methodist Episcopal church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PETER PARSONS.\r\n\r\nPeter Parsons, of Atchison, Kan., is a Kentuckian by birth and has the\r\ndistinction of being the pioneer thresher man of northeast Kansas and\r\nwestern Missouri. He was born in Breathitt county, Kentucky, December\r\n10, 1868, a son of J. W. Parsons, a descendant of an old Virginia\r\nfamily. Peter Parsons’ maternal grandfather, Hatfield, was a soldier in\r\nthe Revolution and fought under General Washington. The Parsons and the\r\nHatfield families were among the earliest pioneers of the State of\r\nKentucky. When Peter was four years of age the Parsons family removed to\r\nBuchanan county. Missouri, and there settled on a farm. Peter was reared\r\nto young manhood on the Missouri farm and attended the district schools.\r\nWhen but a boy he developed an aptitude for machinery and showed a knack\r\nof handling farming implements possessed by few boys of his age. In 1887\r\nhe entered the employ of the A. J. Harwi Hardware Company and worked in\r\nthe farm machinery department of the store. Desiring to gain a more\r\nintimate knowledge of threshing machinery, especially, he went to Battle\r\nCreek, Mich., where the machines were manufactured and learned the\r\nbusiness of building and assembling threshing machines from the ground\r\nup. This was a good business venture on his part, as he soon engaged in\r\nthreshing on his own account and operated threshing outfits for over\r\nnineteen years, and was actively engaged in northeast Kansas and\r\nnorthwest Missouri in this business successfully. He operated several\r\nmachines and crews and had almost a virtual monopoly of the threshing\r\nbusiness in his territory. At the present time Mr. Parsons operates two\r\nthreshing outfits which he owns, but for some years has retired from\r\nactive labor in the fields. The wide range of his activities naturally\r\ngave him an extensive and favorable acquaintance among the farmers of\r\nthis section of the country and he acquired a reputation for thorough\r\nworkmanship and square dealing which has never been surpassed by men\r\nengaged in the same industry. He is probably the oldest threshing\r\nmachine operator at the present time in eastern Kansas or western\r\nMissouri in years of experience, and understands the mechanical part of\r\nthe industry better than any other man in this neighborhood. Mr. Parsons\r\nhas a right to be proud of his record in the agricultural history of\r\nAtchison county and Kansas. From 1903 to 1909 Mr. Parsons was a member\r\nof the Atchison police force and made a record in the department for\r\nefficiency and faithful performance of his duties which is remembered.\r\nHe is a member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles and is well liked by all\r\nwho know him. He is broad-minded in his views and kindly disposed toward\r\nhis fellow men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HENRY SCHIFFBAUER.\r\n\r\nHenry Schiffbauer, pioneer, plainsman, Government scout, and friend of\r\nBuffalo Bill, now lives in comparative quiet on his farm in Kapioma\r\ntownship, Atchison county, after having seen the wildest and wooliest\r\nparts of the great West in its early days. Under his own eyes, Kansas\r\nhas changed from a land of Indians, daubed with bright paint, shouting a\r\nwar-whoop and brandishing tomahawks, to a quiet farming community, where\r\npeaceable citizens drive to church every Sunday. He has seen Kansas\r\nchanged from a broad prairie, with its countless thousands of buffaloes\r\nto a great farming country, with its productive fields, and the trudging\r\nox has been succeeded by the tractor and automobile. Henry Schiffbauer,\r\nin his seventy-five years, has seen the making of a nation; he has seen\r\nthe wild frontier grow into a civilized community, which ranks among the\r\nhighest in intelligence and prosperity. Mr. Schiffbauer was born January\r\n27, 1841, on the River Rhine, in Prussia, Germany. His parents, Michael\r\nand Gertrude (Frentz) Schiffbauer, had thirteen children. The father\r\nfollowed farming in his native land, and in 1851 immigrated to the\r\nUnited States, settling on General Taylor’s farm, in Gamwell county,\r\nKentucky. Four years later he moved to Missouri, and in the same year\r\ncame to Kansas, where he homesteaded a claim in Jefferson county, which\r\nhe farmed until about eight years before his death, which occurred when\r\nhe was eighty-nine years old. The mother of Henry Schiffbauer died in\r\n1854, at the age of fifty-five years. She fell before the terrible\r\nscourge of cholera which swept the United States about that time. The\r\nfour children living are: Charles, Cripple Creek, Colo.; Trassie, a nun,\r\nat Leavenworth, Kan.; Frank, Pittsburgh, Pa.; and Henry, the subject of\r\nthis sketch. All but Frank were born in Germany, he having been born in\r\nGamwell county, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nHenry Schiffbauer’s boyhood was one of rough and hard adventure. He\r\nreceived his education by driving a six-mule team, and his book learning\r\nwas scanty. When he was seventeen years old he went to work for Dr.\r\nDavis, at Leavenworth, Kan. In 1857 he was stationed in the\r\nquartermaster’s department at Ft. Leavenworth, Kan., where he was\r\nemployed eight years. After Lee’s surrender, in 1865, Henry returned to\r\nhis home in Jefferson county, Kansas, and met Buffalo Bill, or as he is\r\nknown in private life, William Cody, for the first time. Here was begun\r\na friendship which continued for many years, and which probably will\r\nlive until one of the friends passes away. Two years later, however, the\r\ntwo men were thrown closer together, and their acquaintance ripened into\r\na close friendship. Henry was guarding and herding mules when he met\r\nBuffalo Bill the second time. The latter was an extra hand on Major &\r\nRussell’s overland freight train. Henry Schiffbauer was the man who\r\ntaught Buffalo Bill to shoot from a saddle, it is said, and the\r\nunequalled skill of the great hunter may be laid at the feet of the\r\nsubject of this sketch. It may be that if Buffalo Bill had not met Henry\r\nSchiffbauer, his life history might have been different, for undoubtedly\r\nit was the stories which Henry told of his experiences that tempted the\r\nyoung man to leave his oxen and follow the wilder life of a Government\r\nscout. Mr. Schiffbauer has seen the most sensational life of the West in\r\nits most dangerous days. Just before the outbreak of the Civil war he\r\ncarried messages for the Government from Ft. Kearney, Neb., to Ft.\r\nLaramie, Colo., and to Salt Lake City, and Ft. Floyd, Utah. These were\r\ntimes when it was dangerous to be a Government messenger. The\r\ndispatchers of the Government were not held in such awe in those days,\r\nand it was not at all unusual to kill a messenger to get his papers. But\r\nMr. Schiffbauer was able to take care of himself, and passed through\r\nthese uncertain times without harm. He served in the secret service\r\ndepartment for eight months, about the time of the second election of\r\nAbraham Lincoln. It was feared by governmental officials that attempts\r\non the President’s life were being planned, and General Thayer, then in\r\ncommand at Ft. Smith, Ark., secured the services of Henry Schiffbauer in\r\nthis difficulty. This was a position won because of fearlessness and\r\ncoolness, even in the most dangerous situations, and to be one of the\r\nprotectors of the President was the honor which repaid him. In 1865 Lee\r\nsurrendered and conditions began to settle.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Schiffbauer saw that his opportunity to serve his country had\r\nceased, he located on the farm which he now owns and built a small farm\r\nhouse, thus settling down to the quiet life of a farmer. He broke his\r\nground with oxen, and worked in the most primitive manner for a few\r\nyears, but gradually he was rewarded for his labors, and he came to have\r\nmore of the comforts and conveniences of a modern farmer, erecting a\r\nlarge stone residence in 1880. His place is one-fourth mile east of\r\nArrington, Kan. It comprises 189 acres, and here he and his wife,\r\nMargaret Glimm, to whom he was married in 1865, have lived since,\r\nrearing a family of eight children. Mrs. Schiffbauer was born in\r\nGermany, March 6, 1848. She is a daughter of John and Christian Glimm,\r\nwho came to Kansas in the early days, bringing their daughter with them.\r\nThe children of Mr. and Mrs. Schiffbauer are: Christena, who married\r\nAllen Kinkaid, of Washington State; Charles E., Belle Plains, Sumner\r\ncounty, Kansas; Sarah married L. E. Wagner, of St. Louis, Mo.; Henry F.,\r\nValley Falls, Kan.; Gertrude married John Nevins, Kapioma township;\r\nRobert is farming near La Cygne, Linne county, Kansas; William,\r\nArrington, Kan.; George, passenger conductor, East St. Louis, Ill. Mr.\r\nSchiffbauer is an independent in politics. He belongs to the Modern\r\nWoodmen of America, and to the Knights and Ladies of Security. He has\r\nhad a remarkable career and remembers the incidents of his early life\r\nwith vividness. Atchison county has few characters with such an\r\ninteresting history.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 while in the quartermaster’s department at Ft. Leavenworth he\r\nwas detailed with General Sumner’s expedition against the Cheyenne\r\nIndians in the far West. This trip required six months and was filled\r\nwith great hardships for the troops. In April of 1858 he accompanied\r\nGen. Sydney Johnston’s expedition to Salt Lake City for the purpose of\r\nsubduing the Mormons, and was gone for eighteen months. He assisted in\r\nbuilding a camp at Ft. Floyd, or Camp Floyd, as it became known at the\r\ntime, forty-five miles south of Salt Lake City. During this trip Mr.\r\nSchiffbauer had his first experience in driving a six-mule team and\r\nhauling “adobes.” The fort was built under the direction of Colonel\r\nCrossmore. He returned to Kansas in the fall of 1859, and went to New\r\nOrleans in the Government secret service, and thence to Baton Rouge,\r\nwhere he remained until after Lincoln’s election, finally making his way\r\nout of the southland with great difficulty, accompanied with personal\r\ndanger to himself. For a period of eight years this plainsman never\r\nslept under a roof, excepting twice at Ft. Bonta, where he was under\r\nshelter for the night. On one of his expeditions to the far West they\r\nhad fed their last grain to the mules, made camp, and the next morning\r\nthe entire camp was under two feet of snow. Mr. Schiffbauer himself\r\nbeing covered over in a gully where he had lain down, wrapped in his\r\nblankets and buffalo robes. He recalls that on this snowy morning the\r\nwagon-master shouted: “I wonder where that damned Dutchman is?” Henry\r\nraised himself out of the snow and called out: “Here I am.” The mules\r\nwere picketed out two and two together the night before, but that\r\nmorning they were put into corrals and were so starved that they tried\r\nto eat each other. The pioneer corps cut down cottonwood trees for fuel,\r\nand the mules ate the branches, which poisoned them, and they died in\r\ntheir tracks, the ravens eating out their eyes while the beasts were in\r\ntheir death throes. The expedition lost sixty mules each day, and the\r\ndrove of 500 animals was depleted to less than sixty head. They lay in\r\ncamp for twelve days, and then moved on the thirteenth day. Henry\r\nrecalls that the favorite team, belonging to General Johnston, was\r\ndrowned through the carelessness of a teamster in fording the swollen\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Schiffbauer was at Baton Rouge in Government service, he was\r\nimportuned by the rebels to join a company as bugler, but declined, and\r\nwith the assistance of a steamboat captain, he managed to get out of the\r\ncountry, and at New Orleans boarded the steamer, “Henry Von Pool,” and\r\nmade his way to St. Louis. From here he went to Ft. Leavenworth and\r\nhandled Government dispatches, working between Ft. Leavenworth, Ft.\r\nScott, Ft. Gibson, Ft. Smith, Little Rock, and hunting forage and wheat\r\nfor the Government. During this service he was sent to Valley Falls,\r\nwith 100 six-mule teams from Ft. Smith for recuperation on the Hoover\r\nfarm. Henry bought all the forage for miles around in order to feed the\r\nmules, and had under him several men for assistants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WILLIAM ADDISON MCKELVY.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 a young man, who had graduated but a few months previously from\r\nthe Philadelphia Dental College came to Atchison, Kan., and finding the\r\ncity to his liking located for practice. The year 1915 finds the same\r\nman, now thirty-five years older, or younger, as his friends speak of\r\nhim, still in the active practice of his profession, and it is said his\r\npractice is a leading one in this section of the State. Thirty-five\r\nyears in Atchison have done much for this man and he has done much for\r\nsuffering humanity. He is the nestor of the dental profession in\r\nnortheastern Kansas, one of the widely known and influential citizens of\r\nthe city and has justly earned the esteem of a large circle of friends\r\nand acquaintances; the esteem which slowly develops only through\r\nhonorable living and kind deeds. His name initiates this review.\r\n\r\nWilliam Addison McKelvy was born in the city of Pittsburgh, Pa., June 5,\r\n1858. His paternal grandfather, Hugh McKelvy, emigrated from Ireland\r\nabout the year 1800. Shortly after reaching America, he located in\r\nPittsburgh and was one of that city’s pioneer brick manufacturers. Dr.\r\nMcKelvy’s father was Col. Samuel McKelvy, born in Pittsburgh, a member\r\nof the firm of Blair & McKelvy, pioneers in the steel industry in that\r\ncity. He married when a young man, Anna B. Pride, a daughter of David\r\nPride, who was also a pioneer resident of Pittsburgh and a native of\r\nScotland. When President Lincoln issued his first call for volunteers,\r\nSamuel McKelvy was among the first to enlist in his home city. He was\r\ncommissioned captain of the Duquesne Greys, Pittsburgh’s crack troop. He\r\nserved his country with distinction and was given important assignments\r\nand received deserved promotion, being commissioned lieutenant-colonel\r\nand served on the staff of General Heintzelman and that of Gen. Phil\r\nSheridan. The convalescent camp of the Union army, situated about seven\r\nmiles south of the city of Washington, was under his charge or\r\nsupervision during his entire term of service. Following his military\r\nservice, he returned to Pittsburgh and his steel business. He was one of\r\nthe first to build a country residence at Sewickley, now famous for its\r\nbeautiful suburban homes owned by the prominent families of the steel\r\ncity. The old McKelvy mansion, now owned by the Doctor’s brother,\r\nWilliam Henry Seward McKelvy, is known as the Park Place Hotel, and is\r\noperated by its owner. Colonel McKelvy died in Sewickley in 1889. To\r\nColonel and Mrs. McKelvy were born nine children of which our subject is\r\nthe eighth.\r\n\r\nWilliam Addison McKelvy was reared in his native city and acquired a\r\nthorough education in its public schools. He later entered the\r\nPhiladelphia Dental College and graduated with the degree of Doctor of\r\nDental Surgery, a member of the class of 1880. Following his graduation\r\nhe returned to Pittsburgh and was engaged in practice for a few months.\r\nIn November of that year he came to Kansas and located in the city of\r\nAtchison on the twenty-fifth of the month. His choice of location was\r\npartly due to having in the person of Dr. William F. Ferguson, a well\r\nestablished surgeon of the city, a friend who assured him that Atchison\r\nwould prove a most satisfactory place in which to build up a practice.\r\nDr. Ferguson assisted in getting him properly started and gave every\r\nevidence of a sincere friendship. He had little difficulty in building\r\nup a lucrative practice and has for many years past been recognized as\r\none of the leading men in his profession in his section of the State. He\r\nis a member of the Kansas City Dental Society, the Kansas State, the\r\nMissouri State and the National Dental Associations.\r\n\r\nDr. McKelvy has never neglected his civic duties, has favored those\r\nmeasures and projects which meant a bigger, better city, but has never\r\nhad time nor the inclination for public office. He has, from the time he\r\ngraduated given his entire time and attention to his profession. He is a\r\nmember of Washington Lodge, No. 4, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, and\r\nAtchison Lodge, No. 647, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.\r\n\r\nDr. McKelvy has been twice married. His first wife was Miss Ella M.\r\nFerguson, a daughter of Dr. Eli Ferguson, a pioneer physician of\r\nAtchison. They were married in November, 1888. Mrs. McKelvy died in\r\n1892. Two children were born to this union: William Ferguson McKelvy, a\r\nhardware merchant of Marliton, W. Va., and Charles S. McKelvy, employed\r\nin the wholesale hardware house of Blish, Mize & Silliman, of Atchison.\r\nOn October 2, 1899, he married Miss Eleanor Cain, a daughter of Alfred\r\nD. Cain, a pioneer miller of Atchison and founder of the Cain Milling\r\nCompany. They are parents of three children: Alfred D., Addison P., and\r\nMona.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GEORGE ROBERT HOOPER.\r\n\r\nGeorge Robert Hooper, an extensive merchandise broker of Atchison, Kan.,\r\nand president of the Babcock-Arensburg Shoe Company, is a native of\r\nVirginia. He was born at Richmond, December 7, 1851, and is a son of\r\nJohn Hancock and Sarah Rebecca Hooper. The mother died when George R.,\r\nof this sketch, was a child, and in 1867 the father removed from\r\nRichmond to Bowling Green, Ky., and later to Paducah, where he died in\r\n1871. He was a contractor and builder. George R. Hooper was one of a\r\nfamily of six children and is the only one now living. He was reared in\r\nVirginia and was educated in private schools. He was about twenty years\r\nold when his father died, and had just completed an apprenticeship at\r\nthe carpenter’s trade. After the death of his father he returned to\r\nVirginia with the remains, and the following year came to Atchison and\r\nentered the retail grocery business as clerk from 1872 to 1876. He was\r\nthen a traveling salesman until 1884, and after that was engaged in the\r\ngrocery business in Atchison about a year and one-half, when he engaged\r\nin the merchandise brokerage business, which he has successfully\r\nconducted to the present time. Mr. Hooper was united in marriage in 1876\r\nto Miss Frances Lucy Howe, a daughter of George W. Howe. Mrs. Hooper is\r\na daughter of George W. Howe, who was one of the very early settlers of\r\nAtchison county. He conducted a store at the town of Sumner and was\r\nlater engaged in freighting across the plains from 1860 to 1865. The\r\nHowe family came from Plattsburg, Clinton county, New York, and Mrs.\r\nHooper’s mother bore the maiden name, Frances Lucy Ellis. To Mr. and\r\nMrs. Hooper have been born three children, as follows: Edith married O.\r\nM. Babcock, a sketch of whom appears in this volume; Gladys Ella is a\r\ngraduate of the Conservatory of Music, Cornell University, and is now a\r\nteacher in the music department of the Iowa State Teachers’ College; and\r\nGeorge Frances Hooper, a graduate of Wentworth Military Academy of\r\nLexington, Mo., and is a traveling salesman. Mr. Hooper is a Democrat,\r\nbut has never aspired to hold political office, although he takes a\r\ncommendable interest in public affairs and is public spirited and is\r\never ready and willing to aid any movement for the betterment of the\r\ncommunity. He is a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks\r\nand secretary of the lodge. He is also local secretary for the United\r\nCommercial Travelers, of which he is a member. He also holds membership\r\nin the Knights of the Maccabees and the Independent Order of Foresters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          RUTHERFORD B. HAWK.\r\n\r\nThe residence and buildings of a farm in any locality are generally\r\ntaken as evidence of the degree of thrift and enterprise of the owners\r\nof the land. If the house and barns and fences of the agricultural plant\r\nare in a “run down at the heels” condition, it is taken as evidence of\r\nthe sterility of the soil and lack of industry, pride and thrift on the\r\npart of the proprietor. On the other hand, if the buildings, fencing,\r\netc., are attractive and well kept, it betokens prosperity and a desire\r\non the part of the farm proprietor to keep things in first class\r\ncondition. The farm home of Rutherford B. Hawk, of the younger\r\ngeneration of farmers in Atchison county, is one of the most attractive\r\nand handsome in the county, barns and fences, fields, orchard and\r\ngardens all making a pleasing appearance. This farm is located in Benton\r\ntownship, north of Effingham in sections 8 and 9, and consists of 240\r\nacres of good land, 160 acres of which lie in section 8, and eighty\r\nacres in section 9, range 618. This is the old home place of Andrew\r\nHawk, father of R. B., and the present owner has lived on the place\r\nsince 1883.\r\n\r\nRutherford B. Hawk was born February 28, 1877, on a farm near\r\nBakersville, Coshocton county, Ohio, a son of Andrew and Lavina (Landes)\r\nHawk, both of whom were born and reared on pioneer farms in Ohio. The\r\nlate Andrew Hawk was born February 4, 1825, and died in 1903. He was\r\nborn in Carroll county, Ohio, a son of Leonard and Margaret Hawk, and\r\nwas one of a large family of ten children. Leonard was born in\r\nWestmoreland county, Pennsylvania, and his people were pioneers in Ohio.\r\nAndrew Hawk came to Kansas in the eighties to make a visit with his\r\nbrother, Daniel, in Atchison county, and liked the country so well that\r\nhe returned to Ohio and disposed of his property and in 1883 came again\r\nto Atchison county and bought a section of land, one mile north and west\r\nof Effingham, in Benton township. He developed this large farm and lived\r\non the place until 1903 when he sold 160 acres. Mrs. Hawk, the widow,\r\nwas the owner of 240 acres of this tract which she sold to her sons.\r\n\r\nAndrew Hawk was twice married, his first marriage taking place in\r\nCoshocton county, Ohio, with Mary Jane Walters, whom he married on May\r\n5, 1848. The following children were born to this union and who are yet\r\nliving are as follows: Mrs. Margaret Alice Zinkorn, of Baltic, Ohio;\r\nMrs. Rachel Emily McFarlan, living on a farm near Monrovia, Atchison\r\ncounty, Kansas; Mrs. Teletha Ellen Dreher, of Minerva, Ohio. The second\r\nmarriage of Andrew Hawk took place May 12, 1864, with Lavina Landes, and\r\nthe following children were born to this union: William Sherman, Howard,\r\nAllen, a farmer near Salina, Kan.; Edgar Russell, located on a farm two\r\nmiles west of Effingham; Arvilla Florence, wife of Herbert Harris,\r\nHorton, Kan.; Charles Arthur, living near Atchison, Kan; Rutherford B.,\r\nwith whom this review is directly concerned; John Andrew, a farmer in\r\nBenton township; Clarissa, at home with her mother. The mother of these\r\nchildren was born April 2, 1844, in Coshocton county, Ohio, a daughter\r\nof Valentine and Elizabeth (Hufford) Landes, the former a native of\r\nGermany, and the latter a native of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nRutherford B. was six years of age when his parents came to Atchison\r\ncounty to make this county their permanent home. He attended the\r\ndistrict school and studied for one year in the county high school. He\r\nhas always resided on the farm where he now lives with the exception of\r\none year spent in the West. Upon his father’s demise he came into\r\npossession of eighty acres by inheritance and purchase, bought an\r\nadditional eighty acres, and eighty acres of land which came to his\r\nwife, make the total of 240 acres which he owns and cultivates. He was\r\nmarried on March 31, 1909, to Mary Agnes Mackay, who was born near\r\nEffingham, educated in the district school and completed the course in\r\nthe Atchison County High School, graduating therefrom in 1898. She\r\ntaught school successfully for a period of ten years, the last two years\r\nof which was as principal of the Effingham school. During the summer of\r\n1908 Mrs. Hawk visited Europe and spent some time amid the old home\r\nscenes of her parents in Scotland and also visited places of interest in\r\nIreland and England.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary Hawk was born on a farm near Effingham, a daughter of George\r\nand Jeanette (Macnee) Mackay, both of whom were born and reared in\r\nScotland. George Mackay was born in Sterlingshire, April 18, 1840.\r\nJeanette Mackay was born January 21, 1843 in Perthshire, Scotland. This\r\nworthy and industrious couple was married July 27, 1868, and three years\r\nlater emigrated from their native heath to America. They first settled\r\non the prairies of Wisconsin near the city of Janesville, and after a\r\nresidence of three years in that locality they removed farther west to\r\nKansas (1874). Mr. Mackay rented land for a short time and then\r\npurchased a tract of prairie land in Benton township. The land which he\r\nbought was unbroken prairie, unfenced and had never known the mark of\r\nthe plow. He at once set about the hard task of developing his prairie\r\nfarm and in the course of time developed it into one of the best and\r\nmost productive agricultural plants in Atchison county. This farm which\r\nMr. Mackay built up was well known as “Walnut Hill Farm.” The Mackays\r\nprospered as they deserved, and with true Scottish thrift increased\r\ntheir land holdings to 280 acres.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mackay died on his farm May 1, 1907. He was a sturdy and upright\r\ncitizen whose honesty was proverbial and he enjoyed the respect and high\r\nesteem of his neighbors. He was a member of the Presbyterian faith and\r\nwas a Democrat in politics. He was also a member of the Ancient Order of\r\nUnited Workmen. Two years after Mr. Mackay’s demise the widow and\r\nchildren removed to a pleasant home in Effingham.\r\n\r\nThe children of this estimable couple were: Alexander, and Georgette, at\r\nhome with their mother; Mary, wife of Rutherford B. Hawk; Nellie\r\nJeanette, deceased wife of Frank Sutter.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this review is a Republican in politics, and while\r\ninterested in the success of his party, and a believer in Republican\r\nprinciples of government, has never sought political preferment. He and\r\nhis wife are members of the Presbyterian church, and Mr. Hawk has served\r\nas an elder of the church for the past six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CALVIN BUSHEY.\r\n\r\nThere is an atmosphere of refinement and well being about the town of\r\nMuscotah, Atchison county, Kansas, that is not always found in the\r\nwestern towns which the traveler passes through. The handsome\r\nresidences, with well kept lawns, shaded by great trees, and the\r\ngenerally attractive appearance of things in the residence portion of\r\nthis prosperous community is sure to attract the eye and cause favorable\r\ncomment. The people inhabitating this town are mostly of eastern descent\r\nand are nearly all pioneers who many years ago settled on the prairies\r\nin the western part of Atchison county, and by dint of industry and hard\r\nwork transformed the wilderness into a smiling and fertile landscape.\r\nMany of them, their work done, have retired to comfortable homes in\r\nMuscotah. Among these is Calvin Bushey and his estimable wife, who came\r\nto Kansas, fought the good fight for a competence and are now taking\r\nlife easy in a beautiful and comfortable home in this attractive Kansas\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in a biographical sense, Calvin Bushey, Union veteran and\r\nretired pioneer farmer, was born July 17, 1844, on a Pennsylvania farm\r\nin Adams county, near the historic city of Gettysburg. He comes of good\r\nold Pennsylvania German stock and is a son of Nicholas (born 1797, died\r\n1852), and Esther (Mickley) Bushey. Nicholas Bushey was born in the\r\nFatherland and immigrated with his parents to America when a youth.\r\nEight children were born to Nicholas Bushey and wife, namely: Peter died\r\nin 1905, at the age of eighty-five years; Mrs. Sarah Hartman died in\r\n1910 at the advanced age of eighty-seven years: George, Union veteran,\r\ndied at the age of eighty-four years; Jacob M., a Union veteran,\r\nresiding at Holmesville, Ohio: Henry died in 1858; Catharine died in\r\n1881; Calvin, with whom this review is concerned; John, a resident of\r\nArendtsville, Pa., and James, deceased. The parents of these children\r\nlived and died on the homestead in Pennsylvania. The grandfather of Mr.\r\nBushey, on his maternal side, was John Jacob Mickley, who figures in\r\nAmerican history as one of the men who helped to haul the old Liberty\r\nBell from Baltimore, Md., to keep it from being captured and destroyed\r\nby the British invaders and hid the bell under a church for safe\r\nkeeping. A son of John Jacob was a soldier in the Revolution. Daniel\r\nMickley, an uncle of Calvin Bushey, lived to the great age of ninety-\r\nnine years, and two other uncles lived to the age of ninety-four and\r\nninety-five years. Longevity is a characteristic of the members of this\r\nremarkable family. Daniel Mickley served in the War of 1812 as a\r\nsergeant.\r\n\r\nCalvin Bushey was reared to young manhood on his father’s farm. When\r\nPresident Lincoln called for troops, with which to quell the rebellion\r\nof the southern states, he responded and enlisted in August of 1862, in\r\nCompany K, One Hundred and twenty-sixth regiment, Pennsylvania infantry,\r\nfor a period of eight months, but served one and one-half years in all.\r\nHe participated in the great battles of Second Bull Run, South Mountain,\r\nAntietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. After Mr.\r\nBushey received his honorable discharge from the service he studied in\r\nHayesville Institute for one year and was then engaged in mercantile\r\nbusiness for two years, and after his marriage in 1867 came to Kansas to\r\nmake his fortune. He and his young wife came directly to Atchison county\r\nand bought 160 acres of land six miles southeast of Muscotah. Not being\r\nexactly satisfied with this farm they sold it three years later and\r\nbought a quarter section of land three miles southeast of Muscotah. This\r\nland was all raw prairie at the time of purchase and it was necessary\r\nfor Mr. Bushey to place all the improvements on it. He cultivated this\r\nfarm until 1903 when he and Mrs. Bushey retired to a home in Muscotah.\r\nHe sold the old homestead for a good price and invested in 120 acres of\r\nland southwest of Muscotah which is being cultivated by his son.\r\n\r\nMr. Bushey was married in January of 1867 to Miss Eva J. Taylor, who has\r\nborne him the following children: Mrs. Myrtle Belle, wife of J. D.\r\nMiller, garage proprietor and farmer, of Muscotah; John C., farmer and\r\nstock buyer, of Muscotah; Esther, wife of J. N. Roach, a farmer, living\r\nnear Muscotah; Chastine Dwight Bushey, a farmer; and two children died\r\nin infancy. The mother of these children was born September 20, 1842, in\r\nDefiance, Ohio (at that time Paulding county, Ohio), a daughter of John\r\nand Lucretia (Bell) Taylor, the former a native of Huntingdon, Pa., and\r\nthe latter a native of Nova Scotia. John Taylor was a son of William\r\nTaylor, who emigrated from Ireland to Pennsylvania, whence he came to\r\nOhio and made a permanent settlement. John Taylor was a prominent man in\r\nhis section of Ohio and served as a member of the Ohio legislature in\r\n1860, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1865 and 1866, six years in all. He also served\r\nas a justice of the peace and was probate judge of Ashland county, Ohio,\r\nfor twelve years. He died in Ashland, Ohio, in 1881. The Taylor children\r\nwere as follows: Mrs. Eva Bushey, William, Arabella, Wilson, Don\r\nFernando, Lavona, and Emma Luverna. Mrs. Bushey is a well educated lady\r\nand taught school in Ohio. It was at Perrysville, Ohio, that Calvin and\r\nEva Bushey first met. Calvin had left his home in Pennsylvania, and\r\nafter studying at the Hayesville Academy he was employed at Perrysville,\r\nOhio, keeping store, attending the railroad office, the express office,\r\nand was general all-round railway factotum, as well as managing a\r\ngeneral store. The future Mrs. Bushey came to the store one day to buy a\r\npair of shoes and Calvin fell a victim to her charms while attending to\r\nher wants. They became friends; the friendship ripened into love, and\r\nmarriage ensued, which has been one of the happiest on record.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bushey are members of the Congregational church and\r\ncontribute to the support of this religious denomination. He is a\r\nRepublican in politics and is a member of the local grand army post.\r\nThis well known and highly respected couple have a total of twenty-one\r\ngrandchildren, as follows: Mrs. Olive Laughlin, Eva, Nannie, Marguerite,\r\nLillie, Josephine, Julia, children of Mr. and Mrs. J. D. Miller; Helen,\r\na teacher, Ruth, also a teacher, Calvin Dwight, Mildred, and Dorothy,\r\nand Louis, children of John C. Bushey; Charles Calvin, Mrs. Bertie\r\nYazel, and Gail, children of Mrs. Esther Roach; Paul Everett, Ralph,\r\nDessa, Essa, and Claude, children of Chastine Dwight Bushey. They have\r\none great-grandchild, Margaret, daughter of Mrs. Olive Laughlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MARTIN C. VANSELL.\r\n\r\nForty-six years ago Martin C. Vansell, pioneer settler of Grasshopper\r\ntownship and one of the best known farmers and live stock breeders of\r\nAtchison county, landed in Muscotah with a cash capital of five dollars.\r\nDuring the forty-six or more years he has lived in the vicinity of\r\nMuscotah he has risen to become one of the wealthy and substantial\r\nlanded proprietors of the county and has reared to maturity a fine\r\nfamily of sons and daughters, educated them and given them a start in\r\nlife. What more honors can a man wish for than these? Could any citizen\r\ncontribute more to the upbuilding of his State and county than this\r\npioneer?\r\n\r\nMr. Vansell was born of old southern stock, on a plantation in Union\r\ncounty, Tennessee, October 24, 1854. He was a son of Dr. Elias Vansell,\r\nof German descent. His mother was before her marriage, Tabitha Willis,\r\nborn and reared in Tennessee, and a daughter of Moses Willis, whose farm\r\nadjoined the Vansell homestead on the river bottoms. She was of English\r\ndescent. There were seven children in the family of Elias and Tabitha\r\nVansell, of which M. C. was the youngest. The ancestral home of the\r\nVansells was a large plantation which stretched for one and one half\r\nmiles along the banks of the Clinch river in Tennessee, and before the\r\nCivil war the land was cultivated by slaves. Dr. Vansell was a physician\r\nof fine education and exceptional talent.\r\n\r\nWhen a boy M. C. Vansell’s education was cut short by the troubles which\r\nbeset the neighborhood during the Civil war when all schools in the\r\nState were closed and Tennessee was torn by the marching and ravaging of\r\ncontending armies. The fortunes of the Willisses and Vansells suffered\r\nan eclipse for the time being and when fifteen years of age he decided\r\nto leave the old home and try his fortune in a newer land. He set out\r\nfor Dade county, Missouri, with a party of men who were en route to the\r\nwild country of southwest Missouri. There was little to induce the boy\r\nto remain at home as his father had died and his mother had re-married.\r\nUpon his arrival in Dade county he was given work as a cow-boy on a big\r\ncattle ranch owned by David Scott and George Igue, brothers-in-law.\r\nYoung Vansell at that time was a fair horseman and his work consisted in\r\ndriving herds of cattle to the ranch from Indian Territory and Texas.\r\nThe nearest point of supply to the ranch was at Sedalia, 100 miles away.\r\nHis next move was to the State of Kansas, and this migration came about\r\nin this wise: In the year 1856 his uncle, Martin C. Willis, had gone\r\nfrom Tennessee to Brown county, Kansas, where he had preëmpted land and\r\nbecome quite wealthy. This uncle heard that his nephew was working on\r\nthe cattle ranch in Missouri and sent for him to come to his home in\r\nBrown county. Although quite in love with the wild free life of the\r\ncattle ranch, he heeded his uncle’s request and joined him at his home.\r\nFor eighteen months after going to his uncle’s home he attended school\r\nand was then employed by his uncle and others as a farm hand for some\r\nyears. On July 17, 1870, he stepped off the train at Muscotah, Kan.,\r\nwith a cash capital of five dollars in his pocket. He worked at farm\r\nlabor until he was twenty-one years of age and then began operating on\r\nhis own account. Mr. Vansell has always been somewhat of a trader. The\r\nfirst deal which he ever made in his life was the purchase of a horse in\r\nMuscotah which involved an outlay of thirty-five dollars for horse,\r\nsaddle and bridle. He later sold this animal for sixty-five dollars,\r\ntook a note in payment, but, sad to relate, the note was never paid and\r\nhe lost the whole amount. When he became of age he traded a span of\r\nmules, of which he had become the owner, for his first forty acres of\r\nland which he had farmed on shares, and with the money earned had bought\r\nthe mules. This trade was made with a Kickapoo Indian. He fenced the\r\nforty-acre tract and rented it to a son-in-law of the Indian who had\r\nformerly owned it, and finally traded the land for some colts, five cows\r\nand twenty-five head of hogs. In a short time afterwards he bought an\r\neighty-acre tract with borrowed money and during the first summer broke\r\nup seventy acres of his eighty, and in the fall built a home for\r\nhimself. The following winter he sowed seventy acres of the tract in\r\nwheat and then sold the land at a good profit in November of that year.\r\nThe following February he bought 160 acres of land, comprising the old\r\ntownsite of Cayuga in Grasshopper township. Mr. Vansell cultivated this\r\ntract for about two years and then sold it at a profit. In 1882 he\r\nbought the quarter section which is now the Vansell home place. He has\r\nadded to his possessions since that time until he is now the owner of\r\n362 acres of land, 320 acres of which is all in one body. It is one of\r\nthe finest and best improved farms in Atchison county. When Mr. Vansell\r\nsettled on this land there were little or no improvements. He now has a\r\nlarge modern ten-room house, two large barns, hog and carriage houses, a\r\nbig double corn-crib and granary, a horse barn, and a special cattle\r\nbarn. The Vansell farm also boasts a 250–ton concrete silo, forty-eight\r\nfeet in height and sixteen feet in diameter. From the start of his\r\nsuccessful agricultural career Mr. Vansell has handled pure bred live\r\nstock, and he is widely known as a breeder of thoroughbred Shorthorn\r\ncattle, Poland China hogs, and standard black Percheron horses. In\r\naddition to this he has some standard trotting horses which are his\r\npride. Since the start of his career Mr. Vansell has never bred any but\r\nthe purest strains of live stock on his ranch and keeps from forty to\r\nsixty head of pure bred cattle on his place at all times.\r\n\r\nMr. Vansell was united in marriage with Miss Alice Trimble, February 23,\r\n1882, and this union has been blessed with the following children: Lena,\r\nwife of Frank Campbell, of Horton, Kan.; Ralph, at home, manages the\r\nVansell home farm; Ray, a student for two years in the State\r\nAgricultural College at Manhattan, Kan., and is now operating a cattle\r\nranch in Montana; George, a graduate of Kansas University, class of\r\n1915, and now employed as an entomologist by the State of Kentucky,\r\nlocated in Lexington; Erma, wife of T. C. Whittaker, of Nortonville,\r\nKan., and Willis Blaine, who died at the age of seventeen years in July,\r\n1904. Mr. Vansell has given each of his children a good education. His\r\ntwo daughters are graduates of the Atchison County High School, and his\r\nson, Ralph, is a graduate of the Veterinary College of Kansas City, and\r\nRay studied for two years in the Manhattan State Agricultural College.\r\nMrs. Alice (Trimble) Vansell, mother of the foregoing children, was born\r\nMay 23, 1854, in Fayette county, Ohio, a daughter of Nathaniel and Jane\r\n(Lorimer) Trimble, natives of Ohio and Pennsylvania, respectively, and\r\nwho were pioneers of Johnson county, Missouri, settling there in 1868.\r\n\r\nMr. Vansell is an independent Republican in his political affiliations,\r\nand refuses to wear a party yoke when his conscience and knowledge lead\r\nhim to think independently, and make up his own mind concerning the\r\nqualifications of candidates or the merits of political principles at\r\nissue. Aside from his extensive farming interests he is a stockholder of\r\nthe Farmers State Bank of Muscotah. He is a member of the Modern Woodmen\r\nand is religiously connected with the Congregational church. Mr. Vansell\r\nis a broad-minded and well read citizen who keeps abreast of the times\r\nand stands high in his community. In a way he is a philosopher who holds\r\nto the correct idea that some men or too many men never grow up and take\r\nthe serious view of life which they should in order to achieve the\r\nsuccess which is their right and in justice to those dependent upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FRANK W. BISHOP.\r\n\r\nFrank Wilson Bishop, live stock dealer and broker, and leading citizen\r\nof Effingham, Kan., has spent the greater part of his sixty-one years of\r\nlife in Atchison county. When a boy he knew what it was to endure the\r\nhardships of the frontier and had little opportunity for schooling until\r\nhe had attained the age of sixteen years. He is a descendant of a fine\r\nold colonial family which can trace their ancestry back to the early\r\ndays of the settlement of New England. His forebears were Puritans, and\r\nhe is a direct lineal descendant of Governor Bishop of Connecticut. A\r\ngrandfather, Levi Bishop, was a soldier in the regular United States\r\narmy and fought in the War of 1812. On the maternal side of his\r\ngrandfather’s family he is a descendant of the old Higgins family of New\r\nYork, which numbers among their progeny Governor Higgins. The Bishops\r\nfor many generations have been military men and in practically every\r\ngeneration the annals of the country show that members of the family\r\nfought in the various wars in which this country has been engaged.\r\n\r\nMr. Bishop was born December 12, 1854, in Alleghany county, New York, a\r\nson of Lucius Hazen and Betsy Morse (Wilson) Bishop, the former a native\r\nof Windsor, Vt., and the latter having been born in Whiteside, N. Y.\r\nLucius was the son of Levi Bishop, who served his country in the War of\r\n1812 as a regularly enlisted soldier. The second wife of Lucius Bishop\r\nwas a Miss Higgins of the Higgins family of New York. It is worthy of\r\nnote that while the Bishops were soldiers and fighting men who believed\r\nin serving the Nation on the battlefields of its wars, the Higgins\r\nfamily were as a class opposed to warfare and it is not recorded that\r\nany of the members of the family enlisted in behalf of their country.\r\nThey were men of letters, teachers, authors and Statesmen rather than\r\nwarriors. The father of Levi Bishop was a soldier in the Revolution,\r\naccording to tradition. The Bishop family left the old home in Alleghany\r\ncounty, New York, in April of 1859. Lucius Bishop having previously made\r\na first trip in 1857 and selected a quarter section of land just north\r\nof Monrovia, Atchison county, Kansas, for his home site. He returned\r\nhome and brought his family to Kansas with the intention of making a\r\npermanent home in Atchison county, and thus giving his children a better\r\nopportunity for gaining a livelihood than the older eastern country\r\nafforded. On his previous trip he had made arrangements for the erection\r\nof a home, and an abiding place was already for the family to occupy\r\nwhen they came here. Frank W. and his mother landed from the Missouri\r\nriver steamer, which they boarded at St. Louis and he recalls that the\r\nday they landed at the foot of Commercial street in Atchison was very\r\nrainy and disagreeable. The family had taken the overland train at\r\nBelmont, N. Y., and rode by rail as far as St. Louis and then boarded\r\nthe “Ben Louis,” which carried them to Atchison. They breakfasted in\r\ntown and then made the trip to the claim by wagon. The outlook and\r\nsurroundings of the vicinity of the family home were not encouraging,\r\nand it required considerable courage to get ready to face the struggle\r\nfor a livelihood in what was then almost a barren wilderness with few\r\nsettlers in the neighborhood. Every fall the members of the family had\r\nthe ague, which did not entirely disappear for many years. There was\r\nalso some trouble with the Indians, and the border warfare added its\r\nquota of troubles to beset this pioneer family. Lucius Bishop served in\r\nCompany F, Twelfth regiment of Kansas cavalry, under Capt. A. S. Best in\r\nthe battle of Westport, which resulted in repelling General Price and\r\nhis army of invasion. The elder Bishop prospered as the years passed,\r\nand in old age he and his faithful helpmeet left the farm and retired to\r\na comfortable home in Effingham, where they both died. Lucius Bishop was\r\nborn January 6, 1824, and died August 9, 1905. Betsy Ann Bishop was born\r\nin 1832, and died March 31, 1907. They were the parents of the following\r\nchildren: Frank Wilson, with whom this review is intimately concerned:\r\nWillis E., who resides on the home farm near Monrovia; Amelia Ann, wife\r\nof C. H. Oliver, both deceased, who were the parents of three sons and\r\ntwo daughters; Sarah H., wife of Hugh N. Gillan, of Hill City, Kan. The\r\ntwo daughters were twins. A sister, Helen Bishop, accompanied Lucius C.\r\nto Kansas. She was the oldest of the family, dying July 6, 1913, at the\r\nadvanced age of ninety-two years. Helen Bishop was born in Randolph,\r\nVt., March 12, 1831, and came to Kansas in 1858. She began teaching when\r\nsixteen years of age, receiving one dollar per week and boarded around.\r\nAt the end of nine years she was receiving two dollars per week. She\r\ntaught several years in Atchison county, and conducted a private school\r\nat Monrovia. She taught at Monrovia and Lancaster. She was one of the\r\npioneer advocates of teaching domestic science in the schools and was\r\nfar ahead of her time. She advocated progressive teaching methods in the\r\nseventies, which are now in practice. She was a thinker and was an\r\nadvocate of purity in living. After the death of her parents she made\r\nher home with Frank W. Bishop.\r\n\r\nFrank W. Bishop was reared to young manhood on the pioneer farm, and had\r\nlittle or no schooling until he attained the age of sixteen years, at\r\nwhich time he realized the necessity of securing an education and\r\nmanaged to attend a short term at the State College at Manhattan, Kan.\r\nHis father purchased a fine tract of farm land in 1873, consisting of\r\n160 acres which Frank leased from him for a few years and then\r\npurchased. He practically built up the farm from a barren tract of\r\nprairie land to be one of the excellent producing farms in Atchison\r\ncounty. He erected all buildings on the place and cultivated the land\r\nvery successfully until 1908, when he removed to Effingham to be better\r\ncare for the extensive live stock business which he had begun in 1895.\r\nMr. Bishop has one of the most attractive homes in this beautiful city,\r\nwhich was formerly the Potter property and maintains a down-town office\r\nwhere he looks after his business affairs. He is not only a buyer and\r\nshipper of live stock but is principally a broker, buying stock in the\r\ncity yards in carload lots for his farmer patrons who feed them on their\r\nfarms for the market. In this manner in the capacity of broker he does a\r\nvery extensive business annually.\r\n\r\nMr. Bishop was married in 1880 to Miss Viola T. Horton, of Atchison\r\ncounty, whose demise occurred in 1886, leaving three children, as\r\nfollows: Ernest L., a farmer, of Atchison county; Carl A., who is first\r\nsergeant of Company I, engineering division, United States regular army,\r\nand who is on duty in the Hawaiian Islands; one child died in infancy.\r\nIn 1890 Mr. Bishop was again married to Miss Mary E. Scott, of Tama\r\ncounty, Iowa, a daughter of Robert A. and Anne (Cannon) Scott, natives\r\nof Scotland, the former born in Kirkcudbrightshire, and the latter born\r\nin Wigtonshire. The Scotts came to America in 1880. Robert was a\r\nstonemason and was one of the builders of the United States treasury\r\nbuilding at Washington. In 1870 the Scotts settled on a farm in Tama\r\ncounty, Iowa, and reared eight children. Robert A. and Anne were married\r\nMay 26, 1848. Robert died November 24, 1911, aged eighty-five years, and\r\nAnne Scott died May 18, 1905, aged eighty years.\r\n\r\nMr. Bishop is a Democrat in his political affiliations, and has held\r\nlocal city offices, doing his duty as a citizen when called upon by his\r\nfellow citizens. Mrs. Bishop is a member of the Presbyterian church, of\r\nwhich Mr. Bishop is a Supporter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WILLIAM RYAN.\r\n\r\nWilliam Ryan, former chief of police of the city of Atchison and\r\nprosperous farmer and iron moulder of Walnut township, was born in\r\nOttawa, Ill., in 1874. He is a son of James and Ellen (Charleston) Ryan,\r\nthe former a native of Connecticut and the latter having been born and\r\nreared partly in Boston, Mass. James Ryan was a son of Patrick Ryan, a\r\nnative of Ireland who, after emigrating from the Emerald Isle, settled\r\nin Connecticut and later became a pioneer of Ottawa, Ill. Patrick Ryan,\r\nwith his wife and seven children, moved to Ottawa, Ill., in an early\r\nday. Later James and his family went to Nebraska and in 1874 moved to\r\nKansas. Patrick Ryan, grandfather of William, was a very prominent\r\ncitizen of his county in Illinois. He served as captain of his company\r\nof Union soldiers during the Civil war and held the office of county\r\ntreasurer for several terms, besides filling other important county\r\noffices. James Ryan, the father, was also a soldier, holding the\r\nposition of sergeant in a company forming part of the Fifty-sixth\r\nregiment of Illinois volunteers. He was taken prisoner and confined for\r\na time in the notorious Andersonville prison. His trade was that of iron\r\nsmelter and for thirty years he was employed in the John Seaton foundry\r\nin that capacity. His son, William, also became an expert moulder and is\r\nnow employed in the Seaton foundry.\r\n\r\nWilliam Ryan, with whom this review is directly concerned, was but an\r\ninfant when the family located in Atchison. He attended the old Doniphan\r\nschool in the city and also the Washington public school, where he was a\r\nschool-mate of Sheffield Ingalls. He learned the trade of iron moulder\r\nat the Seaton foundry and saved his earnings until he was able to\r\npurchase a farm in Walnut township in 1908. He removed to his farm and\r\ncultivated it until 1910 and then returned to Atchison. In 1911 he was\r\nappointed chief of the Atchison police department. Previous to his\r\nappointment to the head position of the city police force he had served\r\nas a member of the city council and was very active in behalf of a\r\nnumber of public and street improvements which were badly needed at the\r\ntime. He was one of the official body responsible for the completion of\r\nthe South Atchison sewer and for the building of a number of paved\r\nstreets. For his activity in behalf of these public improvements he was\r\ndefeated for re-election, but some years later Mr. Ryan was again\r\nelected to office by a handsome majority. Mr. Ryan has a fine farm of\r\n160 acres in Walnut township which was originally covered with a heavy\r\ngrowth of timber, much of which has been cleared away in past years.\r\nUpon his retirement from the position of chief of police he returned to\r\nhis farm, where he resides while he is employed as iron moulder.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1898 to Miss Nellie Cairns, and this union has been\r\nblessed with five children: Blanche, born in 1899; Ruth, born in 1901;\r\nMary Louise, born in 1903; Hugh, born in 1905; Florence, born in 1910.\r\nMrs. Ryan is a daughter of Irish parents and was born in Atchison.\r\n\r\nIn his younger days William Ryan was a noted baseball player. He played\r\nthe left field position on the Atchison team in the first game of\r\nbaseball ever played in Forest park. The aggregation of players with\r\nwhom he was associated were known as the “Corn Carnival Colts.” This\r\nteam became known as the fastest amateur team ever banded together in\r\nthe city of Atchison and became famous over northeast Kansas for their\r\nproficiency in the national game. The name was given to the team when\r\nthey succeeded in defeating the fast “Kansas Blues,” a professional\r\nteam, at the time of the corn carnival held in Atchison. Several players\r\nfrom this team broke into the professional league game and became\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JAMES H. GARSIDE.\r\n\r\nJames H. Garside, retired, is one of the best known and best liked\r\npioneer citizens of Atchison. He has resided in this city for the past\r\nfifty-one years and has a large acquaintance throughout the city and\r\ncounty. For thirty-eight years Mr. Garside was engaged in railroad work\r\nand for twenty-seven years he served as a member of the board of\r\neducation and was vice-president of the board which had charge of the\r\nerection of the Ingalls High School building and other school edifices\r\nin the city. During the time in which he served as the local freight\r\nagent of the Santa Fe railroad Mr. Garside’s position brought him into\r\ncontact with all classes of men and his fine courtesy and obliging\r\nmanner of conducting the company’s business won him high regard and an\r\nenviable reputation.\r\n\r\nMr. Garside was born in Canton, Fulton county, Illinois, January 26,\r\n1848, a son of Joshua and Anna (Cox) Garside. His father was born in\r\nEngland and immigrated to America in 1836. He became engaged in banking\r\nand was a member of the banking firm of Maple, Stipp & Garside, at\r\nCanton, until his removal to Nebraska City, where he opened a bank for\r\nS. F. Nukols. The family came to Atchison in 1864 and Joshua Garside was\r\nassociated with A. S. Parker & Company, forwarding agents, and also\r\nagents for the Star line of steamers plying between St. Joseph and St.\r\nLouis. This firm later became Garside & Son and did an extensive\r\nfreighting business to Denver, Salt Lake and Montana points. They\r\nshipped a vast amount of grain by river steamer; a single boat used in\r\ntheir freighting sometimes took on from 3,000 to 10,000 bushels of grain\r\nand lay at the levee two or three days while loading. This was in the\r\ndays when the Missouri river was the great waterway for transporting\r\nfreight to southern and eastern points. Joshua Garside and wife reared a\r\nfamily of two sons and seven daughters, of which James H. was the\r\neldest.\r\n\r\nJames H. Garside received his education in the public schools of\r\nNebraska City, Neb., and the high school of Atchison. For several years\r\nhe was engaged in the freighting business with his father, as above\r\nstated. Prior to the completion of the Atchison bridge across the\r\nMissouri river, Mr. Garside had charge of the business of transferring\r\nthe railroad freight cars across the river and which were carried to the\r\nMissouri side, and vice versa, by the “William Osborne.” When the bridge\r\nwas completed he was in the employ of the Hamilton & Flint Transfer\r\nCompany, engaged in transferring freight with teams across the river. In\r\n1881 he entered the service of the Santa Fe Railroad Company as local\r\nfreight agent and held this position continuously until his retirement\r\nfrom active service. Before he was engaged by the Santa Fe Mr. Garside\r\nwas an agent for the Continental Fast Freight line, the Commercial\r\nExpress line and the Star Union line.\r\n\r\nMr. Garside was married in 1872 to Miss Hattie H. Preston, of Canton,\r\nIll. One son blessed this union, William Preston. Mr. Garside is\r\naffiliated with the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, and is a member of\r\nWashington Lodge, No. 5, of Washington Commandery, and of the Mystic\r\nShrine. For twenty-seven years he was a member of the board of education\r\nand did his duty as a very useful citizen in helping forward the\r\nadvancement of the Atchison city schools to first rank in the state of\r\nKansas. He served as vice-president of this body for several years, and\r\nwas always found in the forefront of the movement for better school\r\nbuildings and the installation of better educational facilities for the\r\nbenefit of the youth of Atchison. He is one of the charter members of\r\nthe Flambeau Club and also of the Atchison Gun Club. He is religiously\r\naffiliated with the Congregational church and has been one of the\r\ntrustees of this body for several years. In the days of his retirement\r\nthe same geniality and courtesy which he maintained during his years of\r\npublic service marks the demeanor of this grand old citizen of Atchison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WILLIS J. BAILEY.\r\n\r\nWillis J. Bailey, vice-president and managing officer of the Exchange\r\nNational Bank, Atchison, Kan., since 1907, and governor of the State of\r\nKansas from 1903 to 1905, was born in Carroll county, Illinois, October\r\n12, 1854. He was educated in the common schools, the Mount Carroll high\r\nschool, and graduated at the University of Illinois as a member of the\r\nclass of 1879. In 1904 his Alma Mater conferred upon him the degree of\r\nDoctor of Laws. In 1879, soon after completing his college course, he\r\naccompanied his father to Nemaha county, Kansas, where they engaged in\r\nfarming and stock raising, and founded the town of Baileyville. Upon\r\nreaching his majority Governor Bailey cast his lot with the Republican\r\nparty, and since that time he has been an active and consistent advocate\r\nof the principles espoused by that organization. In 1888 he was elected\r\nto represent his county in the State legislature; was reëlected in 1890;\r\nwas president of the Republican State League in 1893; was the Republican\r\ncandidate for Congress in the First district in 1896, and in June, 1898,\r\nwas nominated by the State convention at Hutchison as the candidate for\r\nCongressman at large, defeating Richard W. Blue. After serving in the\r\nFifty-sixth Congress he retired to his farm, but in 1902 was nominated\r\nby his party for governor. At the election in November he defeated W. H.\r\nCraddock, the Democratic candidate, by a substantial majority, and began\r\nhis term as governor in January, 1903. At the close of his term as\r\ngovernor he removed to Atchison, and since 1907 has been vice-president\r\nand manager of the Exchange National Bank of that city. Shortly after\r\nhis retirement from the office of governor he was prominently mentioned\r\nas a candidate for United States senator, and in 1908 a large number of\r\nRepublicans of the State urged his nomination for governor. Mr. Bailey\r\nhas always been interested in behalf of the farmers of the country, and\r\nfrom 1895 to 1899 he was a member of the Kansas State Board of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOHN A. KRAMER.\r\n\r\nJohn A. Kramer, a leading and prosperous farmer of Shannon township, has\r\nthe double distinction of being a pioneer in the county and having one\r\nof the largest families in the State. In this day of small families it\r\nis gratifying to note that in Atchison county, within a few miles of the\r\ncity, resides a man who takes a just pride in the fact that he is\r\nrearing thirteen children to become good citizens of the community. Mr.\r\nKramer is the owner of one of the oldest farms in the county which has\r\nbeen in the family for nearly fifty years. It is one of the valuable\r\nfruit farms in this section of the State and is noted for its small\r\nfruits and orchard products. A handsome brick residence built by the\r\nfather of Mr. Kramer sets well back from the highway and is surrounded\r\nby large trees which have grown to immense size during the life of Mr.\r\nKramer.\r\n\r\nJohn A. Kramer was born October 13, 1862, on the farm where he now\r\nresides and was the son of Frank and Rosalie Kramer, both of whom were\r\nborn, reared and married in Austria, the former having been born in 1820\r\nand the latter in 1827. They emigrated from their native country in\r\nabout 1852, locating first in Wisconsin, going from that State to\r\nMissouri, and in 1857 coming to Atchison county, Kansas. In that year\r\nFrank Kramer settled permanently on the farm now owned by his sons and\r\nbuilt up a fine estate which became noted throughout this section of\r\nKansas. He was one of the pioneers in the fruit industry in the county,\r\nand planted an extensive vineyard, an orchard of thirty to forty acres,\r\nincluding apples, pears and plums, and all kinds of small fruits, the\r\ncultivation of which has been carried on by his sons. The Kramer farm\r\nnow consists of 240 acres of land in a high state of cultivation and\r\nwell improved. Frank Kramer died in 1889 and his wife lived to a\r\nconsiderable age, dying in April of 1911. To them were born three sons\r\nand three daughters, namely: Theresa and Anna, sisters of the Order of\r\nSt. Benedict, in Mt. St. Scholastica Academy; Mrs. Mary Zehnter,\r\ndeceased; Frank, born October 13, 1860, in partnership with John A. in\r\nthe management of the farm; John A. with whom this review is directly\r\nconcerned; Edward, deceased.\r\n\r\nJohn A. Kramer was reared on the farm in Atchison county, and upon the\r\ndeath of his father took up the burden of the family support with his\r\nbrother. He is considered to be one of the substantial and successful\r\nagriculturists of the county and has taken a prominent part in the\r\naffairs of his county since attaining his majority. He was married in\r\n1891 to Phillipina Rambour, born in Bavaria, Germany, a daughter of\r\nMichael Rambour. She came to Atchison when young and here met and\r\nmarried Mr. Kramer. To this estimable couple have been born thirteen\r\nchildren: Mrs. Hattie Dooley, of Shannon township, Martha, Rosalie,\r\nAnna, Tillie, Phillipina, Josephine, Deloris, Mary Constance, Alfred,\r\nJohn, Francis and Edward.\r\n\r\nMr. Kramer is a member of St. Benedict’s Catholic Church and is a\r\nliberal supporter of this denomination. He has been a life-long Democrat\r\nand has been an active and influential figure in his party since\r\nattaining voting age. In 1891 he served one term as trustee of Shannon\r\ntownship and was elected county treasurer in 1893 and again elected to\r\nsucceed himself in 1895. This election took place at a period when the\r\ncounty was strongly Republican and party lines were more strictly drawn\r\nthan at present—evidence of the fact that Mr. Kramer had a strong\r\npersonal following among the citizens of the county.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               JOHN BELZ.\r\n\r\nThe growth and development of any community depends to a considerable\r\nextent upon the management of its financial institutions. The\r\nmanufacturing and commercial enterprises of the city of Atchison, as\r\nwell as the farmers and stockmen in its trade territory, have enjoyed\r\nthe benefits of progressive banking since the first bank was established\r\nin the county. It is in connection with this field of activity that John\r\nBelz became most widely and favorably known in Atchison county. He was\r\nfor many years a managing executive of the German Savings Bank of\r\nAtchison, which he had helped to organize, serving as cashier, and later\r\nfilled the same position with the United States National Bank of\r\nAtchison. He was known to the banking fraternity of Kansas as an able\r\nand discriminating financier, an executive who brought the\r\nadministrative policy of the institutions with which he was connected to\r\nthe point of highest efficiency. He was of material assistance in the\r\ndevelopment of the city of Atchison, an ambitious and tireless worker, a\r\nman of high ideals, and his business integrity and honesty were\r\nunquestioned.\r\n\r\nJohn Belz was a native of Germany, born in Wurtemberg, near the city of\r\nStuttgart, on August 18, 1833. His father was engaged in the milling\r\nbusiness and was a man of some means. John learned the miller’s trade\r\nand also served his apprenticeship as a journeyman carpenter, and he\r\nenjoyed excellent educational advantages in the schools of his home town\r\nand the city of Stuttgart. The elder Belz died when John was nineteen,\r\nin 1852, leaving a comfortable estate which was dissipated by the\r\nadministrator through mismanagement. Thrown on his own resources, and\r\nwith two younger sisters dependent upon him, John came to the conclusion\r\nthat America spelled opportunity for him. Master of a trade, possessed\r\nof an excellent education, thoroughly versed in the German and French\r\nlanguages, he believed that wealth and position were to be won in the\r\nUnited States; and his sisters believed in him. Leaving their native\r\ncountry, they crossed the Atlantic, landed in New York City, and for a\r\ntime lived in Lancaster, N. Y., a little village near the city of\r\nBuffalo, where the brother found employment. A few months later they\r\nlocated in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Here John was employed as a carpenter,\r\nfarm hand, and with such other jobs as offered. He attended school and\r\nacquired a comprehensive knowledge of the English tongue.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 John Belz came to Atchison and during the succeeding twelve or\r\nfifteen months was employed at his trade. He was thrifty and was soon\r\nable to open a small grocery store. His identification with the banking\r\nlife of the city began in 1872, when he, George Storch and Robert\r\nForbriger organized the German Savings Bank. He was elected its first\r\ncashier and filled this position until the institution closed out its\r\nbusiness in 1886. Subsequently he was elected cashier of the United\r\nStates National Bank, and remained in this executive office until 1887,\r\nwhen he resigned. He had early in life acquired the desire, the habit,\r\nthe love of making money and the habit of work. He possessed shrewd\r\nbusiness judgment, keen insight in business affairs, profound knowledge\r\nof men, and these, coupled with will and energy, enabled him to gain\r\nrank as one of the leaders in the financial and commercial life of the\r\ncity. He became directly or indirectly interested in several commercial\r\nenterprises of the city and was closely associated with the late George\r\nStorch, at that time Atchison’s leading man of affairs. Mr. Belz was a\r\nloyal citizen, believed in the commercial future of Atchison, and could\r\nalways be depended upon to assist, both with time and money, any\r\nenterprise or measure which meant a greater, better Atchison. During his\r\nresidence in the city his various investments in financial and\r\ncommercial enterprises were uniformly successful, from which he\r\naccumulated a large fortune. Shortly after his retirement from the\r\nUnited States National Bank he went to California, where he invested\r\nheavily in lands. This venture proved a failure and a large part of his\r\nfortune was lost. From this time until his death, which occurred\r\nSeptember 11, 1895, while not actively engaged in business, he occupied\r\nhimself as a real estate and insurance agent.\r\n\r\nComing to Kansas in 1857, and locating in any of the towns on her\r\neastern border, meant taking sides with one or the other of the\r\npolitical parties. It also required courage upon the part of the\r\nsettler. John Belz possessed not only courage but convictions, and,\r\nalthough a newcomer to the United States had, while living in Iowa,\r\ngiven the slavery question much study which resulted in his aligning\r\nhimself with the Free State party on his arrival in Atchison. He became\r\nactively identified with political affairs and was elected a member of\r\nthe city council, serving several terms. He was also elected to the\r\noffice of city clerk and served several years. Had it not been for his\r\nsensitiveness over his inability to overcome a pronounced German accent\r\nin his English which caused him to decline to speak at public meetings,\r\na most necessary qualification if one desired to attain State-wide\r\nprominence politically, John Belz would have become one of the powers in\r\nthe political life of Kansas. He knew men and the motives which actuated\r\nthem and possessed keen insight as to the demands of the future upon the\r\nlegislators.\r\n\r\nMr. Belz became a member of Washington Lodge, No. 5, Ancient Free and\r\nAccepted Masons, on October 17, 1857. He was one of several who demitted\r\nfrom other lodges and was the oldest Mason among them, having been\r\ninitiated at an earlier date than any of the others. He was also a\r\nmember of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He was reared a Lutheran\r\nand a member of that church in his native town. He never affiliated with\r\nany church after coming to the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Belz married on November 10, 1859, Miss Sophia Binde. She was born\r\nin Prussia, near Madgeburg. She was left an orphan at the age of six\r\nyears and was adopted by her uncle and aunt, Ludwig and Mary Binde, and\r\nwith them and their two sons came to the United States in 1857. They\r\nlocated northwest of the city of Atchison where Mr. Binde engaged in\r\nfarming. He broke the raw prairie, fenced his property, underwent the\r\nprivations incident to that pioneer period and developed a successful\r\nand highly productive farm. He and his wife were persons of culture,\r\ncomfortably situated financially and their children were highly educated\r\nand talented musicians. Among their effects brought from the Fatherland\r\nwere a Grand piano and the complete works of the great composers, which\r\nincluded those by Mozart, Mendelssohn, and Beethoven. Mrs. Belz talks\r\nfamiliarly and interestingly of these composers and has never lost her\r\ninterest in things musical. The vessel which brought the Binde family to\r\nAmerica also carried the Mangelsdorf family, of which August\r\nMangelsdorf, Atchison’s pioneer seedsman, was the youngest member. As\r\ntime went on John Belz came to Atchison and entered the grocery\r\nbusiness. He met Sophia Binde and later she became his wife. His grocery\r\nbusiness required the services of a clerk and August Mangelsdorf filled\r\nthat position. The latter has often remarked that his first employer,\r\nJohn Belz, instilled in him the principles which were the foundation of\r\nhis success in the commercial world; that his rugged honesty, high\r\nideals and close attention to detail in the handling of any matter\r\nremained indelibly imprinted on his mind. Following his precepts has\r\nbrought him a golden harvest.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Belz were the parents of two children, daughters. The\r\neldest, Emma, born in Atchison, was married in 1892 to Augustin M.\r\nMoore, of Denver, Colo. Mr. Moore died in 1906, leaving an infant son\r\nand a daughter, Helen, the wife of Fred Stein, an electrician, of\r\nAtchison. Mr. Moore was a well known insurance adjuster and was in the\r\nemploy of the Shawnee Fire Insurance Company of Topeka. Ida Belz, the\r\nyounger daughter, also born in Atchison, is the wife of Thomas N. Gray,\r\ntreasurer of the Symns Grocer Company of Atchison.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n ┌────┬────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐\r\n │Page│            Changed From            │        Changed To         │\r\n ├────┼────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤\r\n │  37│two years later                     │two centuries later        │\r\n │    │                                    │                           │\r\n │  85│used the construction               │used for the construction  │\r\n │    │                                    │                           │\r\n │ 226│he was forced to take control of the│he was forced to take      │\r\n │    │  paper, and had employed Herman    │  control of the paper, and│\r\n │    │  Van- On August 19, 1915, T.
