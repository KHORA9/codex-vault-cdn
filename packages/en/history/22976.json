I wuz bawned in Rockingham, Richmond County,\r\nNorth Carolina. I wuz eight years old when the Yankees come through. I\r\nbelonged to Marster Tom A. Covington, Sir. My mother wuz named Easter,\r\nand my father wuz named Jacob. We were all Covingtons. No Sir, I don't\r\nknow whur my mother and father come from. Soloman wuz brother number\r\none, then Luke, Josh, Stephen, Asbury. My sisters were Jane, Frances,\r\nWincy, and I wuz nex'. I 'members grandmother. She wuz named Lovie Wall.\r\nThey brought her here from same place. My aunts were named, one wuz\r\nnamed Nicey, and one wuz named Jane. I picked feed for the white folks.\r\nThey sent many of the chillun to work at the salt mines, where we went\r\nto git salt. My brother Soloman wuz sent to the salt mines. Luke looked\r\natter the sheep. He knocked down china berries for 'em. Dad and mammie\r\nhad their own gardens and hogs. We were compelled to walk about at night\r\nto live. We were so hongry we were bound to steal or parish. This trait\r\nseems to be handed down from slavery days. Sometimes I thinks dis might\r\nbe so. Our food wuz bad. Marster worked us hard and gave us nuthin. We\r\nhad to use what we made in the garden to eat. We also et our hogs. Our\r\nclothes were bad, and beds were sorry. We went barefooted in a way.\r\nWhat I mean by that is, that we had shoes part of the time. We got one\r\npair o' shoes a year. When dey wored out we went barefooted. Sometimes\r\nwe tied them up with strings, and they were so ragged de tracks looked\r\nlike bird tracks, where we walked in the road. We lived in log houses\r\ndaubed with mud. They called 'em the slaves houses. My old daddy partly\r\nraised his chilluns on game. He caught rabbits, coons, an' possums. We\r\nwould work all day and hunt at night. We had no holidays. They did not\r\ngive us any fun as I know. I could eat anything I could git. I tell you\r\nde truth, slave time wuz slave time wid us. My brother wore his shoes\r\nout, and had none all thu winter. His feet cracked open and bled so bad\r\nyou could track him by the blood. When the Yankees come through, he got\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nI wuz married in Rockingham. I don't 'member when Mr. Jimmie\r\nCovington, a preacher, a white man, married us. I married James Adams\r\nwho lived on a plantation near Rockingham. I had a nice blue wedding\r\ndress. My husband wuz dressed in kinder light clothes, best I\r\nrickerlect. It's been a good long time, since deen [HW: den] tho'.\r\n\r\nI sho do 'member my Marster Tom Covington and his wife too, Emma. Da\r\nold man wuz the very nick.[HW correction: Nick] He would take what we\r\nmade and lowance us, dat is lowance it out to my daddy after he had\r\nmade it. My father went to Steven Covington, Marster Tom's brother, and\r\ntold him about it, and his brother Stephen made him gib father his meat\r\nback to us.\r\n\r\nMy missus wuz kind to me, but Mars. Tom wuz the buger. It wuz a mighty\r\nbit plantation. I don't know how many slaves wuz on it, there were a lot\r\nof dem do'. Dere were overseers two of 'em. One wuz named Bob Covington\r\nand the other Charles Covington. They were colored men. I rode with\r\nthem. I rode wid 'em in the carriage sometimes. De carriage had seats\r\ndat folded up. Bob wuz overseer in de field, and Charles wuz carriage\r\ndriver. All de plantation wuz fenced in, dat is all de fields, wid\r\nrails; de rails wuz ten feet long. We drawed water wid a sweep and pail.\r\nDe well wuz in the yard. De mules for the slaves wuz in town, dere were\r\nnone on the plantation. Dey had 'em in town; dey waked us time de\r\nchicken crowed, and we went to work just as soon as we could see how to\r\nmake a lick wid a hoe.\r\n\r\nLawd, you better not be caught wid a book in yor han'. If you did, you\r\nwere sold. Dey didn't 'low dat. I kin read a little, but I can't write.\r\nI went to school after slavery and learned to read. We didn't go to\r\nschool but three or four week a year, and learned to read.\r\n\r\nDere wuz no church on the plantation, and we were not lowed to have\r\nprayer meetings. No parties, no candy pullings, nor dances, no sir, not\r\na bit. I 'member goin' one time to the white folkses church, no\r\nbaptizing dat I 'member. Lawd have mercy, ha! ha! No. De pateroller were\r\non de place at night. You couldn't travel without a pas.\r\n\r\nWe got few possums. I have greased my daddy's back after he had been\r\nwhupped until his back wuz cut to pieces. He had to work jis the same.\r\nWhen we went to our houses at night, we cooked our suppers at night, et\r\nand then went to bed. If fire wuz out or any work needed doin' around de\r\nhouse we had to work on Sundays. They did not gib us Christmas or any\r\nother holidays. We had corn shuckings. I herd 'em talkin' of cuttin de\r\ncorn pile right square in two. One wud git on one side, another on the\r\nother side and see which out beat. They had brandy at the corn shuckin'\r\nand I herd Sam talkin' about gittin' drunk.\r\n\r\nI 'member one 'oman dying. Her name wuz Caroline Covington. I didn't go\r\nto the grave. But you know they had a little cart used with hosses to\r\ncarry her to the grave, jist a one horse wagon, jist slipped her in\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nYes, I 'member a field song. It wuz 'Oh! come let us go where pleasure\r\nnever dies. Great fountain gone over'. Dat's one uv 'em. We had a good\r\ndoctor when we got sick. He come to see us. The slaves took herbs dey\r\nfound in de woods. Dat's what I do now, Sir. I got some 'erbs right in\r\nmy kitchen now.\r\n\r\nWhen the Yankees come through I did not know anything about 'em till\r\nthey got there. Jist like they were poppin up out of de ground. One of\r\nthe slaves wuz at his master's house you know, and he said, 'The Yankees\r\nare in Cheraw, S. C. [HW correction: South Carolina] and the Yankees are\r\nin town'. It didn't sturb me at tall. I wuz not afraid of de Yankees. I\r\n'member dey went to Miss Emma's house, and went in de smoke house and\r\nemptied every barrel of 'lasses right in de floor and scattered de\r\ncracklings on de floor. I went dere and got some of 'em. Miss Emma wuz\r\nmy missus. Dey just killed de chickens, hogs too, and old Jeff the dog;\r\nthey shot him through the thoat. I 'member how his mouth flew open when\r\ndey shot him. One uv 'em went into de tater bank, and we chillun wanted\r\nto go out dere. Mother wouldn't let us. She wuz fraid uv 'em.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln freed us by the help of the Lawd, by his help. Slavery\r\nwuz owin to who you were with. If you were with some one who wuz good\r\nand had some feelin's for you it did tolerable well; yea, tolerable\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nWe left the plantation soon as de surrender. We lef' right off. We went\r\nto goin' towards Fayetteville, North Carolina. We climbed over fences\r\nand were just broke down chillun, feet sore. We had a little meat, corn\r\nmeal, a tray, and mammy had a tin pan. One night we came to a old house;\r\nsome one had put wheat straw in it. We staid there, next mornin', we\r\ncome back home. Not to Marster's, but to a white 'oman named Peggy\r\nMcClinton, on her plantation. We stayed there a long time. De Yankees\r\ntook everything dey could, but dey didn't give us anything to eat. Dey\r\ngive some of de 'omen shoes.\r\n\r\nI thinks Mr. Roosevelt is a fine man and he do all he can for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict     No: 3                      [320278]\r\nWorker:      Travis Jordan\r\nNo. Words:   1500\r\nTitle:       Ida Adkins Ex-slave\r\nInterviewed: Ida Adkins\r\n             County Home, Durham, N.

Additions and comments were\r\nleft as notation, in order to preserve the flow of the dialect.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI wuz bawn befo' de war. I wuz about eight years ole when de Yankee mens\r\ncome through.\r\n\r\nMy mammy an' pappy, Hattie an' Jim Jeffries belonged to Marse Frank\r\nJeffries. Marse Frank come from Mississippi, but when I wuz bawn he an'\r\nMis' Mary Jane wuz livin' down herr near Louisburg in North Carolina\r\nwhare dey had er big plantation an' [HW addition: I] don' know how many\r\nniggers. Marse Frank wuz good to his niggers, 'cept [HW addition: that]\r\nhe never give dem ernough to eat. He worked dem hard on half rations,\r\nbut he didn' believe in all de time beatin' an' sellin' dem.\r\n\r\nMy pappy worked at de stables, he wuz er good horseman, but my mammy\r\nworked at de big house helpin' Mis' Mary Jane. Mammy worked in de\r\nweavin' room. I can see her now settin' at de weavin' machine an' hear\r\nde pedals goin' plop, plop, as she treaded dem wid her feets. She wuz a\r\ngood weaver. I stayed 'roun' de big house too, pickin' up chips,\r\nsweepin' de yard an' such as dat. Mis' Mary Jane wuz quick as er\r\nwhippo'-will. She had black eyes dat snapped, an' dey seed everythin'.\r\nShe could turn her head so quick dat she'd ketch you every time you\r\ntried to steal a lump of sugar. I liked Marse Frank better den I did\r\nMis' Mary Jane. All us little chillun called him Big Pappy. Every time\r\nhe went [HW correction: come back] to Raleigh he brung us niggers back\r\nsome candy. He went to Raleigh erbout twice er year. Raleigh wuz er far\r\nways from de plantations--near 'bout sixty miles. [HW notation:\r\ncheck--appears to be about 40 miles only.] It always took Marse Frank\r\nthree days to make de trip. A day to go, er' day to stay in town, an' a\r\nday to come back. Den he always got home in de night. Ceptn' [HW\r\naddition: when] he rode ho'se back 'stead of de carriage, [HW addition:\r\nan'] den sometimes he got home by sun down.\r\n\r\nMarse Frank didn' go to de war. He wuz too ole. So when de Yankees come\r\nthrough dey foun' him at home. When Marse Frank seed de blue coats\r\ncomin' down de road he run an' got his gun. De Yankees was on horses. I\r\nain't never seed so many men. Dey was thick as hornets comin' down de\r\nroad in a cloud of dus' [HW: correction \"dust\"]. Dey come up to de house\r\nan' tied de horses to de palin's; [HW correction: dey was so many dey\r\nwas stan] 'roun' de yard [HW addition: fence]. When dey seed Marse Frank\r\nstandin' on de po'ch [HW correction: porch] wid de gun leveled on dem,\r\ndey got mad. Time Marse Frank done shot one time [HW correction: \"once\r\na\"] a bully Yankee snatched de gun away an' tole Marse Frank to hold up\r\nhis hand. Den dey tied his hands an' pushed him down on de floor 'side\r\nde house an' tole him dat if he moved [HW addition: a inch] dey would\r\nshoot him. Den dey went in de house.\r\n\r\nI wuz skeered near 'bout to death, but I run in de kitchen an' got a\r\nbutcher knife, an' when de Yankees wasn' lookin', I tried to cut de rope\r\nan' set Marse Frank free. But one of dem blue debils seed me an' come\r\nrunnin'. He say:\r\n\r\n'Whut you doin', you black brat! you stinkin' little alligator bait!' He\r\nsnatched de knife from my hand an' told me to stick out my tongue, dat\r\nhe wuz gwine to cut it off. I let out a yell an' run behin' de house.\r\n\r\nSome of de Yankees was in de smoke house gettin' de meat, some of dem\r\nwuz at de stables gettin' de ho'ses, an' some of dem wuz in de house\r\ngettin' de silver an' things. I seed dem put de big silver pitcher an'\r\ntea pot in a bag. Den dey took de knives an' fo'ks an' all de candle\r\nsticks an' platters off de side board. Dey went in de parlor an' got de\r\ngol' clock dat wuz Mis' Mary Jane's gran'mammy's. Den dey got all de\r\njewelry out of Mis' Mary Jane's box.\r\n\r\nDey went up to Mis' Mary Jane, an' while she looked at dem wid her black\r\neyes snappin', dey took de rings off her fingers; den dey took her gol'\r\nbracelet; dey even took de ruby ear rings out of her ears an' de gol'\r\ncomb out of her hair.\r\n\r\nI done quit peepin' in de window an' wuz standin' 'side de house when de\r\nYankees come out in de yard wid all de stuff dey wuz totin' off. Marse\r\nFrank wuz still settin' on de po'ch [HW correction: porch] floor wid his\r\nhan's tied an' couldn' do nothin'. 'Bout dat time I seed de bee gums in\r\nde side yard. Dey wuz a whole line of gums. Little as I wuz I had a\r\nnotion. I run an' got me a long stick an' tu'ned over every one of dem\r\ngums. Den I stirred dem bees up wid dat stick 'twell [HW correction:\r\n'till] dey wuz so mad I could smell de pizen. An' bees! you ain't never\r\nseed de like of bees. Dey wuz swarmin' all over de place. Dey sailed\r\ninto dem Yankees like bullets, each one madder den de other. Dey lit on\r\ndem ho'ses 'twell [HW correction: till] dey looked like dey wuz live [HW\r\ncorrection: alive] wid varmints. De ho'ses broke dey bridles an' tore\r\ndown de palin's an' lit out down de road. But dey [HW correction: dar]\r\nrunnin' wuzn' nothin' to what dem Yankees done. Dey bust out cussin',\r\nbut what did a bee keer about cuss words! Dey lit on dem blue coats an'\r\nevery time dey lit dey stuck in a pizen sting.

McIlhenny who had a big\r\nrice plantation \"Eagles Nest\" in Brunswick County. It was a big place.\r\nHe had lots of slaves, an' he was a good man. My mother and father died\r\nwhen I was fourteen. Father died in February 1865 and my mother died of\r\npneumonia in November 1865. My older sister took charge of me.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: \"Can you read and write?\"\r\n\r\nJoseph: \"Oh yes, I can write a little. I can make my marks. I can write\r\nmy name. No'm I can't read. I never went to school a day in my life. I\r\njust \"picked up\" what I know.\"\r\n\r\nI don't remember much about slave times. I was fourteen when I was\r\nfreed. After I was freed we lived between 8th and 9th on Chestnut. We\r\nrented a place from Dan O'Connor a real estate man and paid him $5 a\r\nmonth rent. I've been married twice. First time was married by Mr. Ed\r\nTaylor, magistrate in Southport, Brunswick County. I was married to my\r\nfirst wife twenty years and eight months. Then she died. I was married\r\nagain when I was seventy-five years old. I was married to my second wife\r\njust a few years when she died.\r\n\r\nI was on the police force for a year and a half. I was elected April 6,\r\n1895. Mr. McIlhenny was an ole man then an' I used to go to see him.\r\n\r\nI was a stevedore for Mr. Alexander Sprunt for sixty years.\r\n\r\nJoseph is now buying his house at 1113 Rankin Street. Rents part of it\r\nfor $8.50 a month to pay for it. He stays in one room.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Joseph's health is none too good, making information sketchy and\r\nincoherent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

I was born on a plantation near Franklinton,\r\nWake County, N. C. May 10, 1851. I was a slave belonging to Sam Brodie,\r\nwho owned the plantation at this place. My missus' name was Evaline. My\r\nfather was Alfred Brodie and my mother was Bertha Brodie.\r\n\r\nWe had good food, plenty of warm homemade clothes and comfortable\r\nhouses. The slave houses were called the quarters and the house where\r\nmarster lived was called the great house. Our houses had two rooms each\r\nand marster's house had twelve rooms. Both the slave and white folks\r\nbuildings were located in a large grove one mile square covered with oak\r\nand hickory nut trees. Marster's house was exactly one mile from the\r\nmain Louisburg Road and there was a wide avenue leading through the\r\nplantation and grove to marster's house. The house fronted the avenue\r\neast and in going down the avenue from the main road you traveled\r\ndirectly west.\r\n\r\nThe plantation was very large and there were about two hundred acres of\r\ncleared land that was farmed each year. A pond was located on the place\r\nand in winter ice was gathered there for summer use and stored in an ice\r\nhouse which was built in the grove where the other buildings were. A\r\nlarge hole about ten feet deep was dug in the ground; the ice was put in\r\nthat hole and covered. [TR: HW note in left margin is illegible.]\r\n\r\nA large frame building was built over it. At the top of the earth there\r\nwas an entrance door and steps leading down to the bottom of the hole.\r\nOther things besides ice were stored there. There was a still on the\r\nplantation and barrels of brandy were stored in the ice house, also\r\npickles, preserves and cider.\r\n\r\nMany of the things we used were made on the place. There was a grist\r\nmill, tannery, shoe shop, blacksmith shop, and looms for weaving cloth.\r\n\r\nThere were about one hundred, and sixty-two slaves on the plantation\r\nand every Sunday morning all the children had to be bathed, dressed, and\r\ntheir hair combed and carried down to marster's for breakfast. It was a\r\nrule that all the little colored children eat at the great house every\r\nSunday morning in order that marster and missus could watch them eat so\r\nthey could know which ones were sickly and have them doctored.\r\n\r\nThe slave children all carried a mussel shell in their hands to eat\r\nwith. The food was put on large trays and the children all gathered\r\naround and ate, dipping up their food with their mussel shells which\r\nthey used for spoons. Those who refused to eat or those who were ailing\r\nin any way had to come back to the great house for their meals and\r\nmedicine until they were well.\r\n\r\nMarster had a large apple orchard in the Tar River low grounds and up\r\non higher ground and nearer the plantation house there was on one side\r\nof the road a large plum orchard and on the other side was an orchard of\r\npeaches, cherries, quinces and grapes. We picked the quinces in August\r\nand used them for preserving. Marster and missus believed in giving the\r\nslaves plenty of fruit, especially the children.\r\n\r\nMarster had three children, one boy named Dallas, and two girls, Bettie\r\nand Carrie. He would not allow slave children to call his children\r\nmarster and missus unless the slave said little marster or little\r\nmissus. He had four white overseers but they were not allowed to whip a\r\nslave. If there was any whipping to be done he always said he would do\r\nit. He didn't believe in whipping so when a slave got so bad he could\r\nnot manage him he sold him.\r\n\r\nMarster didn't quarrel with anybody, missus would not speak short to a\r\nslave, but both missus and marster taught slaves to be obedient in a\r\nnice quiet way. The slaves were taught to take their hats and bonnets\r\noff before going into the house, and to bow and say, 'Good morning\r\nMarster Sam and Missus Evaline'. Some of the little negroes would go\r\ndown to the great house and ask them when it wus going to rain, and when\r\nmarster or missus walked in the grove the little Negroes would follow\r\nalong after them like a gang of kiddies. Some of the slave children\r\nwanted to stay with them at the great house all the time. They knew no\r\nbetter of course and seemed to love marster and missus as much as they\r\ndid their own mother and father. Marster and missus always used gentle\r\nmeans to get the children out of their way when they bothered them and\r\nthe way the children loved and trusted them wus a beautiful sight to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nPatterollers were not allowed on the place unless they came peacefully\r\nand I never knew of them whipping any slaves on marster's place. Slaves\r\nwere carried off on two horse wagons to be sold. I have seen several\r\nloads leave. They were the unruly ones. Sometimes he would bring back\r\nslaves, once he brought back two boys and three girls from the slave\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nSunday wus a great day on the plantation. Everybody got biscuits\r\nSundays. The slave women went down to marsters for their Sunday\r\nallowance of flour. All the children ate breakfast at the great house\r\nand marster and missus gave out fruit to all. The slaves looked forward\r\nto Sunday as they labored through the week. It was a great day. Slaves\r\nreceived good treatment from marster and all his family.\r\n\r\nWe were allowed to have prayer meetings in our homes and we also went\r\nto the white folks church.\r\n\r\nThey would not teach any of us to read and write. Books and papers were\r\nforbidden. Marster's children and the slave children played together. I\r\nwent around with the baby girl Carrie to other plantations visiting. She\r\ntaught me how to talk low and how to act in company. My association with\r\nwhite folks and my training while I was a slave is why I talk like white\r\nfolks.\r\n\r\nBettie Brodie married a Dr. Webb from Boylan, Virginia. Carrie married\r\na Mr. Joe Green of Franklin County. He was a big southern planter.\r\n\r\nThe war was begun and there were stories of fights and freedom. The\r\nnews went from plantation to plantation and while the slaves acted\r\nnatural and some even more polite than usual, they prayed for freedom.\r\nThen one day I heard something that sounded like thunder and missus and\r\nmarster began to walk around and act queer. The grown slaves were\r\nwhispering to each other. Sometimes they gathered in little gangs in the\r\ngrove. Next day I heard it again, boom, boom, boom. I went and asked\r\nmissus 'is it going to rain?' She said, 'Mary go to the ice house and\r\nbring me some pickles and preserves.' I went and got them. She ate a\r\nlittle and gave me some. Then she said, 'You run along and play.' In a\r\nday or two everybody on the plantation seemed to be disturbed and\r\nmarster and missus were crying. Marster ordered all the slaves to come\r\nto the great house at nine o'clock. Nobody was working and slaves were\r\nwalking over the grove in every direction. At nine o'clock all the\r\nslaves gathered at the great house and marster and missus came out on\r\nthe porch and stood side by side. You could hear a pin drap everything\r\nwas so quiet. Then marster said, 'Good morning,' and missus said, 'Good\r\nmorning, children'. They were both crying. Then marster said, 'Men,\r\nwomen and children, you are free. You are no longer my slaves. The\r\nYankees will soon be here.'\r\n\r\nMarster and missus then went into the house got two large arm chairs\r\nput them on the porch facing the avenue and sat down side by side and\r\nremained there watching.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour there was one of the blackest clouds coming up the\r\navenue from the main road. It was the Yankee soldiers, they finally\r\nfilled the mile long avenue reaching from marster's house to the main\r\nLouisburg road and spread out over the mile square grove. The mounted\r\nmen dismounted. The footmen stacked their shining guns and began to\r\nbuild fires and cook. They called the slaves, saying, 'Your are free.'\r\nSlaves were whooping and laughing and acting like they were crazy.\r\nYankee soldiers were shaking hands with the Negroes and calling them\r\nSam, Dinah, Sarah and asking them questions. They busted the door to the\r\nsmoke house and got all the hams. They went to the ice-house and got\r\nseveral barrels of brandy, and such a time. The Negroes and Yankees were\r\ncooking and eating together. The Yankees told them to come on and join\r\nthem, they were free. Marster and missus sat on the porch and they were\r\nso humble no Yankee bothered anything in the great house. The slaves\r\nwere awfully excited. The Yankees stayed there, cooked, eat, drank and\r\nplayed music until about night, then a bugle began to blow and you never\r\nsaw such getting on horses and lining up in your life. In a few minutes\r\nthey began to march, leaving the grove which was soon as silent as a\r\ngrave yard. They took marster's horses and cattle with them and joined\r\nthe main army and camped just across Cypress Creek one and one half\r\nmiles from my marster's place on the Louisburg Road.\r\n\r\nWhen they left the country, lot of the slaves went with them and soon\r\nthere were none of marster's slaves left. They wandered around for a\r\nyear from place to place, fed and working most of the time at some\r\nother slave owner's plantation and getting more homesick every day.\r\n\r\nThe second year after the surrender our marster and missus got on their\r\ncarriage and went and looked up all the Negroes they heard of who ever\r\nbelonged to them. Some who went off with the Yankees were never heard of\r\nagain. When marster and missus found any of theirs they would say,\r\n'Well, come on back home.' My father and mother, two uncles and their\r\nfamilies moved back. Also Lorenza Brodie, and John Brodie and their\r\nfamilies moved back. Several of the young men and women who once\r\nbelonged to him came back. Some were so glad to get back they cried,\r\n'cause fare had been mighty bad part of the time they were rambling\r\naround and they were hungry. When they got back marster would say, 'Well\r\nyou have come back home have you, and the Negroes would say, 'Yes\r\nmarster.' Most all spoke of them as missus and marster as they did\r\nbefore the surrender, and getting back home was the greatest pleasure of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nWe stayed with marster and missus and went to their church, the Maple\r\nSprings Baptist church, until they died.\r\n\r\nSince the surrender I married James Anderson. I had four children, one\r\nboy and three girls.\r\n\r\nI think slavery was a mighty good thing for mother, father, me and the\r\nother members of the family, and I cannot say anything but good for my\r\nold marster and missus, but I can only speak for those whose conditions\r\nI have known during slavery and since. For myself and them, I will say\r\nagain, slavery was a mighty good thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District: No. 2                    [320280]\r\nWorker:         Mary A.

I wish I could recall some of the ole days when I\r\nwas with my missus in Orange County, playing with my brothers and other\r\nslave children.\r\n\r\nI was owned by Mr. Franklin Davis and my madam was Mrs. Bettie Davis. I\r\nand my brother used to scratch her feet and rub them for her; you know\r\nhow old folks like to have their feet rubbed. My brother and I used to\r\nscrap over who should scratch and rub her feet. She would laugh and tell\r\nus not to do that way that she loved us both. Sometimes she let me sleep\r\nat her feet at night. She was plenty good to all of the slaves. Her\r\ndaughter Sallie taught me my A B C's in Webster's Blue Back spelling\r\nBook. When I learned to Spell B-a-k-e-r, Baker, I thought that was\r\nsomething. The next word I felt proud to spell was s-h-a-d-y, shady, the\r\nnext l-a-d-y, lady. I would spell them out loud as I picked up chips in\r\nthe yard to build a fire with. My missus Bettie gave me a blue back\r\nspelling book.\r\n\r\nMy father was named James Mason, and he belonged to James Mason of\r\nChapel Hill. Mother and I and my four brothers belonged to the same man\r\nand we also lived in the town. I never lived on a farm or plantation in\r\nmy life. I know nothing about farming. All my people are dead and I\r\ncannot locate any of marster's family if they are living. Marster's\r\nfamily consisted of two boys and two girls--Willie, Frank, Lucy and\r\nSallie. Marster was a merchant, selling general merchandise. I remember\r\neating a lot of brown sugar and candy at his store.\r\n\r\nMy mother was a cook. They allowed us a lot of privileges and it was\r\njust one large happy family with plenty to eat and wear, good sleeping\r\nplaces and nothing to worry about. They were of the Presbyterian faith\r\nand we slaves attended Sunday school and services at their church. There\r\nwere about twelve slaves on the lot. The houses for slaves were built\r\njust a little ways back from marster's house on the same lot. The Negro\r\nand white children played together, and there was little if any\r\ndifference made in the treatment given a slave child and a white child.\r\nI have religious books they gave me. Besides the books they taught me,\r\nthey drilled me in etiquette of the times and also in courtesy and\r\nrespect to my superiors until it became a habit and it was perfectly\r\nnatural for me to be polite.\r\n\r\nThe first I knew of the Yankees was when I was out in my marster's yard\r\npicking up chips and they came along, took my little brother and put him\r\non a horse's back and carried him up town. I ran and told my mother\r\nabout it. They rode brother over the town a while, having fun out of\r\nhim, then they brought him back. Brother said he had a good ride and was\r\npleased with the blue jackets as the Yankee soldiers were called.\r\n\r\nWe had all the silver and valuables hid and the Yankees did not find\r\nthem, but they went into marster's store and took what they wanted. They\r\ngave my father a box of hardtack and a lot of meat. Father was a\r\nChristian and he quoted one of the Commandments when they gave him\r\nthings they had stolen from others. 'Thou shalt not steal', quoth he,\r\nand he said he did not appreciate having stolen goods given to him.\r\n\r\nI traveled with the white folks in both sections of the country, north\r\nand south, after the _War Between the States_. I kept traveling with them\r\nand also continued my education. They taught me to recite and I made\r\nmoney by reciting on many of the trips. Since the surrender I have\r\ntraveled in the north for various Charitable Negro Societies and\r\nInstitutions and people seemed very much interested in the recitation I\r\nrecited called \"When Malinda Sings\".\r\n\r\nThe first school I attended was after the war closed. The school was\r\nlocated in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and was taught by a Yankee white\r\nwoman from Philadelphia. We remained in Chapel Hill only a few years\r\nafter the war ended when we all moved to Raleigh, and I have made it my\r\nhome ever since. I got the major part of my education in Raleigh under\r\nDr. H. M. Tupper[1] who taught in the second Baptist Church, located on\r\nBlount Street. Miss Mary Lathrop, a colored teacher from Philadelphia,\r\nwas an assistant teacher in Dr. Tupper's School. I went from there to\r\nShaw Collegiate Institute, which is now Shaw University.\r\n\r\nI married Aaron Stallings of Warrenton, North Carolina while at Shaw.\r\nHe died and I married Rev. Matthews Anngady of Monrovia, west coast of\r\nAfrica, Liberia, Pastor of First Church. I helped him in his work here,\r\nkept studying the works of different authors, and lecturing and\r\nreciting. My husband, the Rev. Matthews Anngady died, and I gave a lot\r\nof my time to the cause of Charity, and while on a lecture tour of\r\nMassachusetts in the interest of this feature of colored welfare for\r\nRichmond, Va., the most colorful incident of my eventful life happened\r\nwhen I met Quango Hennadonah Perceriah, an Abyssinian Prince, who was\r\ntraveling and lecturing on the customs of his country and the habits of\r\nits people. Our mutual interests caused our friendship to ripen fast and\r\nwhen the time of parting came, when each of us had finished our work in\r\nMassachusetts, he going back to his home in New York City and I\r\nreturning to Richmond, he asked me to correspond with him. I promised to\r\ndo so and our friendship after a year's correspondence became love and\r\nhe proposed and I accepted him. We were married in Raleigh by Rev. J. J.\r\nWorlds, pastor of the First Baptist Church, colored.\r\n\r\nP. T. Barnum had captured my husband when he was a boy and brought him\r\nto America from Abyssinia, educated him and then sent him back to his\r\nnative country. He would not stay and soon he was in America again. He\r\nwas of the Catholic faith in America and they conferred the honor of\r\npriesthood upon him but after he married me this priesthood was taken\r\naway and he joined the Episcopal Church. After we were married we\r\ndecided to go on an extensive lecture tour. He had been a headsman in\r\nhis own country and a prince. We took the customs of his people and his\r\nexperiences as the subject of our lectures. I could sing, play the\r\nguitar, violin and piano, but I did not know his native language. He\r\nbegan to teach me and as soon as I could sing the song _How Firm A\r\nFoundation_ in his language which went this way:\r\n\r\n    Ngama i-bata, Njami buyek\r\n    Wema Wemeta, Negana i\r\n    bukek diol, di Njami,\r\n    i-diol de Kak\r\n    Annimix, Annimix hanci\r\n\r\n    Bata ba Satana i-bu butete\r\n    Bata ba Npjami i bunanan\r\n    Bata be satana ba laba i wa--\r\n    Bata ba Njami ba laba Munonga\r\n\r\nWe traveled and lectured in both the north and the south and our life,\r\nwhile we had to work hard, was one of happiness and contentment. I\r\ntraveled and lectured as the Princess Quango Hennadonah Perceriah, wife\r\nof the Abyssinian Prince. I often recited the recitation written by the\r\ncolored poet, Paul Lawrence Dunbar _When Malinda Sings_ to the delight of\r\nour audiences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following incidents of African life were related to me by my husband\r\nQuango Hennadonah Perceriah and they were also given in his lectures on\r\nAfrican customs while touring the United States.\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Bakuba tribe of Abyssinia was almost wholly Pagan\r\nas the natives believed fully in witchcraft, sorcery, myths and\r\nsuperstitions. The witch doctor held absolute sway over the members of\r\nthe tribe and when his reputation as a giver of rain, bountiful crops or\r\nsuccess in the chase was at stake the tribes were called together and\r\nthose accused by the witch doctor of being responsible for these\r\nconditions through witchery were condemned and speedily executed.\r\n\r\nThe people were called together by the beating of drums. The witch\r\ndoctor, dressed in the most hellish garb imaginable with his body\r\npainted and poisonous snake bone necklaces dangling from his neck and\r\nthe claws of ferocious beasts, lions, leopards and the teeth of vicious\r\nman-eating crocodiles finishing up his adornment, sat in the middle of\r\na court surrounded by the members of the tribe. In his hand he carried a\r\ngourd which contained beads, shot, or small stones. He began his\r\nincantations by rattling the contents of the gourd, shouting and making\r\nmany weird wails and peculiar contortions. After this had gone on for\r\nsometime until he was near exhaustion his face assumed the expression of\r\none in great pain and this was the beginning of the end for some poor\r\nignorant savage. He squirmed and turned in different directions with his\r\neyes fixed with a set stare as if in expectancy when suddenly his gaze\r\nwould be fixed on some member of the tribe and his finger pointed\r\ndirectly at him. The victim was at once seized and bound, the doctor's\r\ngaze never leaving him until this was done. If one victim appeased his\r\nnervous fervor the trial was over but if his wrought-up feelings desired\r\nmore his screechings continued until a second victim was secured. He had\r\nthese men put to death to justify himself in the eyes of the natives of\r\nhis tribe for his failing to bring rain, bountiful crops and success to\r\nthe tribe.\r\n\r\nThe witch doctor who sat as judge seemed to have perfect control over\r\nthe savages minds and no one questioned his decisions. The persons were\r\nreconciled to their fate and were led away to execution while they\r\nmoaned and bade their friends goodbye in the doleful savage style.\r\nSometimes they were put on a boat, taken out into the middle of a river\r\nand there cut to pieces with blades of grass, their limbs being\r\ndismembered first and thrown into the river to the crocodiles. A drink\r\ncontaining an opiate was generally given the victim to deaden the pain\r\nbut often this formality was dispensed with. The victims were often cut\r\nto pieces at the place of trial with knives and their limbs thrown out\r\nto the vultures that almost continuously hover 'round the huts and\r\nkraals of the savage tribes of Africa.\r\n\r\nIn some instances condemned persons were burned at the stake. This form\r\nof execution is meted out at some of the religious dances or festivities\r\nto some of their pagan gods to atone and drive away the evil spirits\r\nthat have caused pestilences to come upon the people. The victims at\r\nthese times are tortured in truly savage fashion, being burned to death\r\nby degrees while the other members of the tribe dance around and go wild\r\nwith religious fervor calling to their gods while the victim screeches\r\nwith pain in his slowly approaching death throes. Young girls, women,\r\nboys and men are often accused of witchcraft. One method they used of\r\ntelling whether the victim accused was innocent or guilty was to give\r\nthem a liquid poison made from the juice of several poisonous plants. If\r\nthey could drink it and live they were innocent, if they died they were\r\nguilty. In most cases death was almost instantaneous. Some vomited the\r\npoison from their stomachs and lived.\r\n\r\nThe Bakubas sometimes resorted to cannibalism and my husband told me\r\nof a Bakuba girl who ate her own mother. Once a snake bit a man and he\r\nat once called the witch doctor. The snake was a poisonous one and the\r\nman bitten was in great pain. The witch doctor whooped and went through\r\nseveral chants but the man got worse instead of better. The witch doctor\r\nthen told the man that his wife made the snake bite him by witchery and\r\nthat she should die for the act. The natives gathered at once in\r\nresponse to the witch doctor's call and the woman was executed at once.\r\nThe man bitten by the snake finally died but the witch doctor had\r\nshifted the responsibility of his failure to help the man to his wife\r\nwho had been beheaded. The witch doctor had justified himself and the\r\nincident was closed.\r\n\r\nThe tribe ruled by a King has two or more absolute rules. The Kings\r\nword is law and he has the power to condemn any subject to death at any\r\ntime without trial. If he becomes angry or offended with any of his\r\nwives a nod and a word to his bodyguard and the woman is led away to\r\nexecution. Any person of the tribe is subject to the King's will with\r\nthe exemption of the witch doctor. Executions of a different nature than\r\nthe ones described above are common occurrences. For general crimes the\r\nculprit after being condemned to death is placed in a chair shaped very\r\nmuch like the electric chairs used in American prisons in taking the\r\nlives of the condemned. He is then tied firmly to the chair with thongs.\r\nA pole made of a green sapling is firmly implanted in the earth nearby.\r\nA thong is placed around the neck of the victim under the chin. The\r\nsapling is then bent over and the other end of the thong tied to the end\r\nof the sapling pole. The pole stretches the neck to its full length and\r\nholds the head erect. Drums are sometimes beaten to drown the cries of\r\nthose who are to be killed. The executioner who is called a headsman\r\nthen walks forward approaching the chair from the rear. When he reaches\r\nit he steps to the side of the victim and with a large, sharp,\r\nlong-bladed knife lops off the head of the criminal. The bodies of men\r\nexecuted in this manner are buried in shallow holes dug about two feet\r\ndeep to receive their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe rank and file of the savage tribes believe explicitly [HW\r\ncorrection: implicitly] in the supernatural powers of the witch doctor\r\nand his decisions are not questioned. Not even the King of the tribe\r\nraises a voice against him. The witch doctor is crafty enough not to\r\ncondemn any of the King's household or any one directly prominent in the\r\nKing's service. After an execution everything is quiet in a few hours\r\nand the incident seems forgotten. The African Negroes attitude towards\r\nthe whole affair seems to be instinctive and as long as he escapes he\r\ndoes not show any particular concern in his fellowman. His is of an\r\nanimal instinctive nature.\r\n\r\nThe males of the African tribes of savages have very little respect for\r\na woman but they demand a whole lot of courtesies from their wives,\r\nbeating them unmercifully when they feel proper respect has not been\r\nshown them. The men hunt game and make war on other tribes and the women\r\ndo all the work. A savage warrior when not engaged in hunting or war,\r\nsleeps a lot and smokes almost continuously during his waking hours.\r\nGirls are bought from their parents while mere children by the payment\r\nof so many cows, goats, etc. The King can take any woman of the tribe\r\nwhether married or single he desires to be his wife. The parents of\r\nyoung girls taken to wife by the King of a tribe feel honored and fall\r\non their knees and thank the King for taking her.\r\n\r\nThe prince of a tribe is born a headsman and as soon as he is able to\r\nwield a knife he is called upon to perform the duty of cutting off the\r\nheads of criminals who are condemned to death by the King for general\r\ncrimes. Those condemned by the witch doctor for witchcraft are executed\r\nby dismemberment or fire as described above.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy husband was a cannibal headsman and performed this duty of cutting\r\noff persons heads when a boy and after being civilized in America this\r\nfeature of his early life bore so heavily upon his mind that it was\r\ninstrumental in driving him insane. By custom a prince was born a\r\nheadsman and it was compulsory that he execute criminals. He died in an\r\ninsane ward of the New Jersey State Hospital.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: [HW: ]Dr. Henry M.

C.\r\n\r\n\r\nI ort to be able to tell sumpin cause I wus twelve years old when dey\r\nhad de surrender right up here in Raleigh. If I live to see dis coming\r\nDecember I will be eighty five years old. I was born on the 18th of\r\nDecember 1852.\r\n\r\nI belonged to Jackson May of Nash County. I wus born on de plantation\r\nnear Tar River. Jackson May never married until I wus of a great big\r\ngirl. He owned a lot of slaves; dere were eighty on de plantation before\r\nde surrender. He married Miss Becky Wilder, sister of Sam Wilder. De\r\nWilders lived on a jining plantation to where I wus borned.\r\n\r\nJackson May had so many niggers he let Billy Williams who had a\r\nplantation nearby have part of 'em. Marster Jackson he raised my father\r\nand bought my mother. My mother wus named Louisa May, and my father wus\r\nnamed Louis May. My mother had six chilluns, four boys and two girls.\r\nThe boys were Richard, Farro, Caeser, and Fenner. De girls Rose and\r\nJane. Jane, dats me.\r\n\r\nWe lived in log houses with stick an' dirt chimleys. They called 'em\r\nthe slave houses. We had chicken feather beds to sleep on an' de houses\r\nwus good warm comfortable log houses. We had plenty of cover an' feather\r\npillows.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother on my mother's side told me a lot of stories 'bout\r\nhaints and how people run from 'em. Dey told me 'bout slaves dat had\r\nbeen killed by dere marster's coming back and worryin' 'em. Ole Missus\r\nPenny Williams, before Jackson May bought mother, treated some of de\r\nslaves mighty bad. She died an' den come back an' nearly scared de\r\nslaves to death. Grandmother told all we chillun she seed her an' knowed\r\nher after she been dead an' come back.\r\n\r\nJohn May a slave wus beat to death by Bill Stone an' Oliver May. Oliver\r\nMay wus Junius May's son. Junius May wus Jackson May's Uncle. John May\r\ncome back an' wurried both of 'em. Dey could hardly sleep arter dat. Dey\r\nsaid dey could hear him hollerin' an' groanin' most all de time. Dese\r\nwhite men would groan in dere sleep an' tell John to go away. Dey would\r\nsay, 'Go way John, please go away'. De other slaves wus afraid of 'em\r\ncause de ghost of John wurried 'em so bad.\r\n\r\nI wurked on de farm, cuttin' corn stalks and tendin' to cattle in\r\nslavery time. Sometimes I swept de yards. I never got any money for my\r\nwork and we didn't have any patches. My brothers caught possums, coons\r\nand sich things an' we cooked 'em in our houses. We had no parties but\r\nwe had quiltin's. We went to the white folks church, Peach Tree Church,\r\nsix miles from de plantation an' Poplar Springs Church seven miles away.\r\nBoth were missionary Baptist Churches.\r\n\r\nThere were no overseers on Jackson May's plantation. He wouldn't have\r\nnary one. Billy Williams didn't have none. Dey had colored slave\r\nforemen.\r\n\r\nAfter wurkin' all day dere wus a task of cotton to be picked an' spun\r\nby 'em. Dis wus two onces of cotton. Some of de slaves run away from\r\nBill Williams when Marster Jackson May let him have 'em to work. Dey run\r\naway an' come home. Aunt Chaney runned away an' mother run away. Marster\r\nJackson May kept 'em hid cause he say dey wus not treated right. He\r\nwouldn't let 'em have 'em back no more.\r\n\r\nI never saw a grown slave whupped or in chains and I never saw a slave\r\nsold. Jackson May would not sell a slave. He didn't think it right. He\r\nkept 'em together. He had eighty head. He would let other white people\r\nhave 'em to wurk for 'em sometimes, but he would not sell none of 'em.\r\n\r\nIf dey caught a slave wid a book you knowed it meant a whuppin', but de\r\nwhite chillun teached slaves secretey sometimes. Ole man Jake Rice a\r\nslave who belonged to John Rice in Nash County wus teached by ole John\r\nRice's son till he had a purty good mount of larnin'.\r\n\r\nWe did not have prayer meeting at marster's plantation or anywhur.\r\nMarster would not allow dat.\r\n\r\nWhen I wus a child we played de games of three handed reels, 'Old Gray\r\nGoose', 'All Little Gal, All Little Gal, All Little Gal remember me'. We\r\ntook hold of hands an' run round as we sang dis song.\r\n\r\nWe sang 'Old Dan Tucker'. Git outen de way, ole Dan Tucker, Sixteen\r\nHosses in one stable, one jumped out an' skined his nable an' so on.\r\n\r\nDr. Mann and Dr. Sid Harris and Dr. Fee Mann and Dr. Mathias looked\r\narter us when we wus sick. Mother and de other grown folks raised herbs\r\ndat dey give us too. Chillun took a lot of salts.\r\n\r\nJackson May wus too rich to go to de war. Billy Williams didn't go, too\r\nrich too, I reckons. I remember when dey said niggers had to be free. De\r\npapers said if dey could not be freedom by good men dere would be\r\nfreedom by blood. Dey fighted an' kept on fightin' a long time. Den de\r\nYankees come. [HW correction: New paragraph] I heard dem beat de drum.\r\nMarster tole us we wus free but mother an' father stayed on with\r\nMarster. He promised 'em sumptin, but he give 'em nothin'. When de crop\r\nwus housed dey left.\r\n\r\nFather and mother went to Hench Stallings plantation and stayed there\r\none year. Then they went to Jim Webbs farm. I don't remember how long\r\nthey stayed there but round two years. They moved about an' about among\r\nthe white folks till they died. They never owned any property. They been\r\ndead 'bout thirty years.\r\n\r\nI married Sidney Arrington. He has been dead six years las' September.\r\n\r\nI am unable to do any kind of work. My arm is mighty weak.\r\n\r\nI know slavery wus a bad thing. I don't have to think anything about\r\nit. Abraham Lincoln wus the first of us bein' free, I think he wus a man\r\nof God.

C., and I belonged to\r\nJ. B. Smith. His wife wus named Henrietta. He owned about thirty slaves.\r\nWhen a slave was no good he wus put on the auction block in Fayetteville\r\nand sold.\r\n\r\nMy father wus named Romeo Harden and my mother wus named Alice Smith.\r\nThe little cabin where I wus born is still standing.\r\n\r\nThere wus seven children in marster's family, four girls and two boys.\r\nThe girls wus named Ellen, Ida, Mary and Elizabeth. The boys wus named\r\nHarry, Norman and Marse George. Marse George went to the war. Mother had\r\na family of four girls. Their names wus: Mary, Kate, Hannah and myself,\r\nSarah Louise. I am the only one living and I would not be living but I\r\nhave spent most of my life in white folk's houses and they have looked\r\nafter me. I respected myself and they respected me.\r\n\r\nMy first days of slavery wus hard. I slept on a pallet on the floor of\r\nthe cabin and just as soon as I wus able to work any at all I wus put\r\nto milking cows.\r\n\r\nI have seen the paterollers hunting men and have seen men they had\r\nwhipped. The slave block stood in the center of the street, Fayetteville\r\nStreet, where Ramsey and Gillespie Street came in near Cool Springs\r\nStreet. The silk mill stood just below the slave market. I saw the\r\nsilkworms that made the silk and saw them gather the cocoons and spin\r\nthe silk.\r\n\r\nThey hung people in the middle of Ramsey Street. They put up a gallows\r\nand hung the men exactly at 12 o'clock.\r\n\r\nI ran away from the plantation once to go with some white children to\r\nsee a man hung.\r\n\r\nThe only boats I remember on the Cape Fear wus the Governor Worth, The\r\nHurt, The Iser and The North State. Oh! Lord yes, I remember the stage\r\ncoach. As many times as I run to carry the mail to them when they come\r\nby! They blew a horn before they got there and you had to be on time\r\n'cause they could not wait. There wus a stage each way each day, one up\r\nand one down.\r\n\r\nMr. George Lander had the first Tombstone Marble yard in Fayetteville\r\non Hay Street on the point of Flat Iron place. Lander wus from Scotland.\r\nThey gave me a pot, a scarf, and his sister gave me some shells. I have\r\nall the things they gave me. My missus, Henrietta Smith, wus Mr.\r\nLander's sister. I waited on the Landers part of the time. They were\r\nhard working white folks, honest, God fearing people. The things they\r\ngave me were brought from over the sea.\r\n\r\nI can remember when there wus no hospital in Fayetteville. There wus a\r\nlittle place near the depot where there wus a board shanty where they\r\noperated on people. I stood outside once and saw the doctors take a\r\nman's leg off. Dr. McDuffy wus the man who took the leg off. He lived on\r\nHay Street near the Silk Mill.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the white folks died they sent slaves around to the homes\r\nof their friends and neighbors with a large sheet of paper with a piece\r\nof black crepe pinned to the top of it. The friends would sign or make a\r\ncross mark on it. The funerals were held at the homes and friends and\r\nneighbors stood on the porch and in the house while the services were\r\ngoing on. The bodies were carried to the grave after the services in a\r\nblack hearse drawn by black horses. If they did not have black horses to\r\ndraw the hearse they went off and borrowed them. The colored people\r\nwashed and shrouded the dead bodies. My grandmother wus one who did\r\nthis. Her name wus Sarah McDonald. She belonged to Capt. George\r\nMcDonald. She had fifteen children and lived to be one hundred and ten\r\nyears old. She died in Fayetteville of pneumonia. She wus in Raleigh\r\nnursing the Briggs family, Mrs. F. H. Briggs' family. She wus going home\r\nto Fayetteville when she wus caught in a rain storm at Sanford, while\r\nchanging trains. The train for Fayetteville had left as the train for\r\nSanford wus late so she stayed wet all night. Next day she went home,\r\ntook pneumonia and died. She wus great on curing rheumatism; she did it\r\nwith herbs. She grew hops and other herbs and cured many people of this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nShe wus called black mammy because she wet nursed so many white\r\nchildren. In slavery time she nursed all babies hatched on her marster's\r\nplantation and kept it up after the war as long as she had children.\r\n\r\nGrandfather wus named Isaac Fuller. Mrs. Mary Ann Fuller, Kate Fuller,\r\nMr. Will Fuller, who wus a lawyer in Wall Street, New York, is some of\r\ntheir white folks. The Fullers were born in Fayetteville. One of the\r\nslaves, Dick McAlister, worked, saved a small fortune and left it to\r\nMr. Will Fuller. People thought the slave ought to have left it to his\r\nsister but he left it to Mr. Will. Mr. Fuller gives part of it to the\r\nex-slaves sister each year. Mr. Will always helped the Negroes out when\r\nhe could. He was good to Dick and Dick McAlister gave him all his\r\nbelongings when he died.\r\n\r\nThe Yankees came through Fayetteville wearing large blue coats with\r\ncapes on them. Lots of them were mounted, and there were thousands of\r\nfoot soldiers. It took them several days to get through town. The\r\nSouthern soldiers retreated and then in a few hours the Yankees covered\r\nthe town. They busted into the smokehouse at marstar's, took the meat,\r\nmeal and other provisions. Grandmother pled with the Yankees but it did\r\nno good. They took all they wanted. They said if they had to come again\r\nthey would take the babies from the cradles. They told us we were all\r\nfree. The Negroes begun visiting each other in the cabins and became so\r\nexcited they began to shout and pray. I thought they were all crazy.\r\n\r\nWe stayed right on with marster. He had a town house and a big house on\r\nthe plantation. I went to the town house to work, but mother and\r\ngrandmother stayed on the plantation. My mother died there and the\r\nwhite folks buried her. Father stayed right on and helped run the farm\r\nuntil he died. My uncle, Elic Smith, and his family stayed too.\r\nGrandfather and grandmother after a few years left the plantation and\r\nwent to live on a little place which Mrs. Mary Ann Fuller gave them.\r\nGrandmother and grandfather died there.\r\n\r\nI wus thirty years old when I married. I wus married in my missus'\r\ngraduating dress. I wus married in the white folks' church, to James\r\nHenry Harris. The white folks carried me there and gave me away. Miss\r\nMary Smith gave me away. The wedding wus attended mostly by white\r\nfolks.\r\n\r\nMy husband wus a fireman on the Cape Fear river boats and a white man's\r\nNegro too. We had two children, both died while little. My husband and I\r\nspent much of our time with the white folks and when he wus on his runs\r\nI slept in their homes. Often the children of the white families slept\r\nwith me. We both tried to live up to the standards of decency and\r\nhonesty and to be worthy of the confidence placed in us by our white\r\nfolks.\r\n\r\nMy husband wus finally offered a job with a shipping concern in\r\nDeleware and we moved there. He wus fireman on the freighter\r\nWilmington. He worked there three years, when he wus drowned. After his\r\ndeath I married David Augustus and immediately came back to North\r\nCarolina and my white folks, and we have been here ever since.

C.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wus borned in the year 1852, July 27. I wus born in Granville County,\r\nsold to a slave speculator at ten years old and carried to Southwest,\r\nGeorgia. I belonged to Samuel Howard. His daughter took me to Kinston,\r\nNorth Carolina and I stayed there until I wus sold. She married a man\r\nnamed Bill Brown, and her name wus Julia Howard Brown. My father wus\r\nnamed Paul Howard and my mother wus named Chollie Howard. My old missus\r\nwus named Polly Howard.\r\n\r\nJohn Richard Keine from Danville, Virginia bought me and sent me to a\r\nplantation in Georgia. We only had a white overseer there. He and his\r\nwife and children lived on the plantation. We had slave quarters there.\r\nSlaves were bought up and sent there in chains. Some were chained to\r\neach other by the legs, some by the arms. They called the leg chains\r\nshackles. I have lived a hard life. I have seen mothers sold away from\r\ntheir babies and other children, and they cryin' when she left. I have\r\nseen husbands sold from their wives, and wives sold from their husbands.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln came through once, but none of us knew who he wus. He\r\nwus just the raggedest man you ever saw. The white children and me saw\r\nhim out at the railroad. We were settin' and waitin' to see him. He said\r\nhe wus huntin' his people; and dat he had lost all he had. Dey give him\r\nsomethin' to eat and tobacco to chew, and he went on. Soon we heard he\r\nwus in de White House then we knew who it wus come through. We knowed\r\nden it wus Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nWe children stole eggs and sold 'em durin' slavery. Some of de white\r\nmen bought 'em. They were Irishmen and they would not tell on us. Their\r\nnames were Mulligan, Flanagan and Dugan. They wore good clothes and were\r\nfunny mens. They called guns flutes.\r\n\r\nBoss tole us Abraham Lincoln wus dead and we were still slaves. Our\r\nboss man bought black cloth and made us wear it for mourning for Abraham\r\nLincoln and tole us that there would not be freedom. We stayed there\r\nanother year after freedom. A lot o' de niggers knowed nothin' 'cept\r\nwhat missus and marster tole us. What dey said wus just de same as de\r\nLawd had spoken to us.\r\n\r\nJust after de surrender a nigger woman who wus bad, wus choppin' cotton\r\nat out plantation in Georgie. John Woodfox wus de main overseer and his\r\nson-in-law wus a overseer. Dey had a colored man who dey called a nigger\r\ndriver. De nigger driver tole de overseer de woman wus bad. De overseer\r\ncame to her, snatched de hoe from her and hit her. The blow killed her.\r\nHe was reported to de Freedman's Bureau. Dey came, whupped de overseer\r\nand put him in jail. Dey decided not to kill him, but made him furnish\r\nde children of de dead woman so much to live on. Dere wus a hundred or\r\nmore niggers in de field when this murder happened.\r\n\r\nWe finally found out we were free and left. Dey let me stay with Miss\r\nJulia Brown. I was hired to her. She lived in Dooley County, Georgia. I\r\nnext worked with Mrs. Dunbar after staying with Mrs. Brown four years.\r\nHer name wus Mrs. Winnie Dunbar and she moved to Columbia, South\r\nCarolina takin' me with her. I stayed with her about four years. This\r\nwus the end of my maiden life. I married Isaac Austin of Richmond\r\nCounty, Georgia. He wus a native of Warrenton County and he brought me\r\nfrom his home in Richmond County, Georgia to Warrenton and then from\r\nWarrenton to Raleigh. I had two brothers and thirteen sisters. I did\r\ngeneral house work, and helped raise children during slavery, and right\r\nafter de war. Then you had to depend on yourself to do for children. You\r\nhad to doctor and care for them yourself. You just had to depend on\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nDey had 320 acres o' cleared fields in Georgia and then de rice fields,\r\nI just don't know how many acres. I have seen jails for slaves. Dey had\r\na basement for a jail in Georgia and a guard at de holes in it.\r\n\r\nNo, No! you better not be caught tryin' to do somethin' wid a book. Dey\r\nwould teach you wid a stick or switch. De slaves had secret prayer\r\nmeetin's wid pots turned down to kill de soun' o' de singin'. We sang a\r\nsong, 'I am glad salvation's free.' Once dey heard us, nex' mornin' dey\r\ntook us and tore our backs to pieces. Dey would say, 'Are you free? What\r\nwere you singin' about freedom?' While de niggers were bein' whupped\r\nthey said, 'Pray, marster, pray.'\r\n\r\nThe doctor came to see us sometimes when we were sick, but not after.\r\nPeople just had to do their own doctorin'. Sometimes a man would take\r\nhis patient, and sit by de road where de doctor travelled, and when he\r\ncome along he would see him. De doctor rode in a sully drawn by a horse.\r\nHe had a route, one doctor to two territories.\r\n\r\nWhen de white folks were preparing to go to de war they had big dinners\r\nand speakin'. Dey tole what dey were goin' to do to Sherman and Grant. A\r\nlot of such men as Grant and Sherman and Lincoln came through de South\r\nin rags and were at some o' dese meetings, an' et de dinners. When de\r\nwhite folks foun' it out, dere wus some sick folks. Sometimes we got two\r\ndays Christmas and two days July. When de nigger wus freed dey didn't\r\nknow where to go and what to do. It wus hard, but it has been hard\r\nsince. From what de white folks, marster and missus tole us we thought\r\nLincoln wus terrible. By what mother and father tole me I thought he wus\r\nall right. I think Roosevelt wus put in by God to do the right things.\r\n\r\nEH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District:     No. 2               [320012]\r\nWorker:             Mary A.

Marse Henry wus good ter us so we had a heap of prayer\r\nmeetin's an' corn shuckin's an' such.\r\n\r\nI 'members de big meetin's dat we'd have in de summer time an' dat good\r\nsingin' we'd have when we'd be singin' de sinners through. We'd stay\r\npretty nigh all night to make a sinner come through, an' maybe de week\r\natter de meetin' he'd steal one of his marster's hogs. Yes'um, I'se had\r\na bad time.\r\n\r\nYou know, missy, dar ain't no use puttin' faith in nobody, dey'd fool\r\nyou ever time anyhow. I know once a patteroller tol' me dat iffen I'd\r\ngive him a belt I found dat he'd let me go by ter see my gal dat night,\r\nbut when he kotch me dat night he whupped me. I tol' Marse Henry on him\r\ntoo so Marse Henry takes de belt away from him an' gives me a possum fer\r\nhit. Dat possum shore wus good too, baked in de ashes like I done it.\r\n\r\nI ain't never hear Marse Henry cuss but once an' dat wus de time dat\r\nsome gentlemens come ter de house an' sez dat dar am a war 'twixt de\r\nnorth an' de south. He sez den, 'Let de damn yaller bellied Yankees come\r\non an' we'll give 'em hell an' sen' dem a-hoppin' back ter de north in a\r\nhurry.'\r\n\r\nWe ain't seed no Yankees 'cept a few huntin' Rebs. Dey talk mean ter us\r\nan' one of dem says dat we niggers am de cause of de war. 'Sir,' I sez,\r\n'folks what am a wantin' a war can always find a cause'. He kicks me in\r\nde seat of de pants fer dat, so I hushes.\r\n\r\nI stayed wid Marse Henry till he died den I moved ter Wilson. I has\r\nworked everwhere, terbacker warehouses an' ever'thing.

I have neuritis, an' have been unable to work any fer a year\r\nand fer seven years I couldn't do much.\r\n\r\nMy mother wus named Teeny McIntire and my father William McIntire.\r\nMammy belonged to Bryant Newkirk in Duplin County. Pap belonged to\r\nsomeone else, I don't know who.\r\n\r\nDey said dey worked from light till dark, and pap said dey beat him so\r\nbad he run away a lot o' times. Dey said de paterollers come to whare\r\ndey wus havin' prayer meetin' and beat 'em.\r\n\r\nMammy said sometimes dey were fed well and others dey almost starved.\r\nDey got biscuit once a week on Sunday. Dey said dey went to de white\r\nfolks's church. Dey said de preachers tole 'em dey had to obey dere\r\nmissus and marster. My mammy said she didn't go to no dances 'cause she\r\nwus crippled. Some o' de help, a colored woman, stole something when she\r\nwus hongry. She put it off on mother and missus made mother wear\r\ntrousers for a year to punish her.\r\n\r\nMammy said dey gave de slaves on de plantation one day Christmas and\r\ndat New Years wus when dey sold 'em an' hired 'em out. All de slaves wus\r\nscared 'cause dey didn't know who would have to go off to be sold or to\r\nwork in a strange place. Pap tole me 'bout livin' in de woods and 'bout\r\ndey ketchin' him. I 'member his owner's name den, it wus Stanley. He run\r\naway so bad dey sold him several times. Pap said one time dey caught him\r\nand nearly beat him to death, and jest as soon as he got well and got a\r\ngood chance he ran away again.\r\n\r\nMammy said when de Yankees come through she wus 'fraid of 'em. De\r\nYankees tole her not to be 'fraid of 'em. Dey say to her, 'Do dey treat\r\nyou right', Mammy said 'Yes sir', 'cause ole missus wus standin' dere,\r\nan' she wus 'fraid not to say yes. Atter de war, de fust year atter de\r\nsurrender dey moved to James Alderman's place in Duplin County and\r\nstayed dere till I wus a grown gal.\r\n\r\nDen we moved to Goldsboro. Father wus a carpenter and he got a lot of\r\ndat work. Dat's what he done in Goldsboro. We come from Goldsboro to\r\nRaleigh and we have lived here every since. We moved here about de year\r\no' de shake and my mother died right here in Raleigh de year o' de\r\nshake. Some of de things mother tole me 'bout slavery, has gone right\r\nout of my min'. Jes comes and goes.\r\n\r\nI remember pap tellin' me' bout stretchin' vines acrost roads and paths\r\nto knock de patterollers off deir horses when dey were tryin' to ketch\r\nslaves. Pap and mammy tole me marster and missus did not 'low any of de\r\nslaves to have a book in deir house. Dat if dey caught a slave wid a\r\nbook in deir house dey whupped 'em. Dey were keerful not to let 'em\r\nlearn readin' and writin'.\r\n\r\nDey sold my sister Lucy and my brother Fred in slavery time, an' I have\r\nnever seen 'em in my life. Mother would cry when she was tellin' me\r\n'bout it. She never seen 'em anymore. I jes' couldn't bear to hear her\r\ntell it widout cryin'. Dey were carried to Richmond, an' sold by old\r\nmarster when dey were chillun.\r\n\r\nWe tried to get some news of brother and sister. Mother kept 'quiring\r\n'bout 'em as long as she lived and I have hoped dat I could hear from\r\n'em. Dey are dead long ago I recons, and I guess dare aint no use ever\r\nexpectin' to see 'em. Slavery wus bad and Mr. Lincoln did a good thing\r\nwhen he freed de niggers. I caint express my love for Roosevelt. He has\r\nsaved so many lives. I think he has saved mine. I want to see him face\r\nto face. I purely love him and I feel I could do better to see him and\r\ntell him so face to face.\r\n\r\nLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

My\r\nbrothers wuz Rufus, William an' George, an' my sisters wuz Mary an'\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\nI 'minds me of de days when as a youngin' [HW correction: youngun'] I\r\nplayed marbles an' hide an' seek. Dar wuzn't many games den, case nobody\r\nain't had no time fer 'em. De grown folkses had dances an' sometimes\r\nco'n shuckin's, an' de little niggers patted dere feets at de dances an'\r\ndey he'p ter shuck de co'n. At Christmas we had a big dinner, an' from\r\nden through New Year's Day we feast, an' we dance, an' we sing. De fust\r\none what said Christmas gift ter anybody else got a gif', so of cou'se\r\nwe all try ter ketch de marster.\r\n\r\nOn de night 'fore de first day of Jinuary we had a dance what lasts all\r\nnight. At midnight when de New Year comes in marster makes a speech an'\r\nwe is happy dat he thanks us fer our year's wuck an' says dat we is\r\ngood, smart slaves.\r\n\r\nMarster wucked his niggers from daylight till dark, an' his thirteen\r\ngrown slaves had ter ten' 'bout three hundred acres o' land. Course dey\r\nmostly planted co'n, peas an' vege'ables.\r\n\r\nI can 'member, do' I wuz small, dat de slaves wuz whupped fer\r\ndisobeyin' an' I can think of seberal dat I got. I wuz doin' housewuck\r\nat de time an' one of de silber knives got misplaced. Dey 'cused me of\r\nmisplacin' it on purpose, so I got de wust beatin' dat I eber had. I wuz\r\nbeat den till de hide wuz busted hyar an' dar.\r\n\r\nWe little ones had some time ter go swimmin' an' we did; we also\r\nfished, an' at night we hunted de possum an' de coon sometimes. Ole\r\nUncle Jeems had some houn's what would run possums or coons an' he uster\r\ntake we boys 'long wid him.\r\n\r\nI 'members onct de houn's struck a trail an' dey tree de coon. Uncle\r\nJeems sen's Joe, who wuz bigger den I wuz, up de tree ter ketch de coon\r\nan' he warns him dat coons am fightin' fellers. Joe doan pay much mind\r\nhe am so happy ter git der chanct ter ketch de coon, but when he ketched\r\ndat coon he couldn't turn loose, an' from de way he holler yo' would\r\ns'pose dat he ain't neber wanted ter ketch a coon. When Joe Barbour wuz\r\nburied hyar las' winter dem coon marks wuz still strong on his arms an'\r\nhan's an' dar wuz de long scar on his face.\r\n\r\nI 'members onct a Yankee 'oman from New York looks at him an' nigh\r\n'bout faints. 'I reckon', says she, dat am what de cruel slave owner or\r\ndriver done ter him'.\r\n\r\nYes mam, I knows when de Yankees comed ter Smithfield. Dey comed wid de\r\nbeatin' of drums an' de wavin' of flags. Dey says dat our governor wuz\r\nhyar makin' a speech but he flewed 'fore dey got hyar. Anyhow, we libed\r\noff from de main path of march, an' so we ain't been trouble so much\r\n'cept by 'scootin' parties, as my ole missus call' em.\r\n\r\nDey am de darndest yo' eber seed, dey won't eat no hog meat 'cept hams\r\nan' shoulders an' dey goes ter de smoke house an' gits 'em 'thout no\r\npermission. Dey has what dey calls rammin' rods ter dere guns an' dey\r\nknock de chickens in de haid wid dat. I hyard dem say dat dar warn't no\r\nuse wastin' powder on dem chickens.\r\n\r\nDey went ober de neighborhood stealin' an' killin' stock.

De\r\nfoun' all de things we done hid, not dat I thinks dat dey am witches,\r\nbut dat dey has a money rod, an' 'cides dat some of de slaves tol' 'em\r\nwhar marster had hid de things.\r\n\r\nYes 'um, I reckon I wuz glad ter git free, case I knows den dat I won't\r\nwake up some mornin' ter fin' dat my mammy or some ob de rest of my\r\nfamily am done sold.

My mammy plowed an' done such\r\nwork all de time uv slavery, but she done it case she wanted to do it\r\nan' not 'cause dey make her.\r\n\r\nAll de slaves hate de Yankees an' when de southern soldiers comed by\r\nlate in de night all de niggers got out of de bed an' holdin' torches\r\nhigh dey march behin' de soldiers, all of dem singin', 'We'll Hang Abe\r\nLincoln on de Sour Apple Tree.'

I was born Oct. 7, 1862, near Fayetteville,\r\nCumberland County, North Carolina. My father's name was Simon Bectom. He\r\nwas 86 years of age when he died. He died in 1910 at Fayetteville, N. C.\r\nMy mother's name was Harriet Bectom. She died in 1907, May 23, when she\r\nwas seventy years old. My brother's were named Ed, Kato and Willie. I\r\nwas third of the boys. My sisters were Lucy, Anne and Alice. My father\r\nfirst belonged to Robert Wooten of Craven County, N. C. Then he was sold\r\nby the Wootens to the Bectoms of Wayne County, near Goldsboro, the\r\ncounty seat. My mother first belonged to the McNeills of Cumberland\r\nCounty. Miss Mary McNeill married a McFadden, and her parents gave my\r\nmother to Mis' Mary. Mis' Mary's daughter in time married Ezekial King\r\nand my mother was then given to her by Mis' Mary McFadden, her mother.\r\nMis' Lizzie McFadden became a King. My grandmother was named Lucy\r\nMurphy. She belonged to the Murpheys. All the slaves were given off to\r\nthe children of the family as they married.\r\n\r\nMy father and mother told me stories of how they were treated at\r\ndifferent places. When my grandmother was with the Murpheys they would\r\nmake her get up, and begin burning logs in new grounds before daybreak.\r\nThey also made her plow, the same as any of the men on the plantation.\r\nThey plowed till dusk-dark before they left the fields to come to the\r\nhouse. They were not allowed to attend any dances or parties unless they\r\nslipped off unknowin's. They had candy pullings sometimes too. While\r\nthey would be there the patterollers would visit them. Sometimes the\r\npatterollers whipped all they caught at this place, all they set their\r\nhands on, unless they had a pass.\r\n\r\nThey fed us mighty good. The food was well cooked. They gave the slaves\r\nan acre of ground to plant and they could sell the crop and have the\r\nmoney. The work on this acre was done on moonshiny nights and holidays.\r\nSometimes slaves would steal the marster's chickens or a hog and slip\r\noff to another plantation and have it cooked. We had plenty of clothes,\r\nand one pair o' shoes a year. You had to take care of them because you\r\nonly got one pair a year. They were given at Christmas every year. The\r\nclothes were made on the plantation.\r\n\r\nThere were corn mills on the plantation, and rice mills, and threshing\r\nmachines. The plantation had about 300 acres in farm land. The enclosure\r\nwas three miles. My marster lived in a fine house. It took a year to\r\nbuild it. There were about 16 rooms in it. We slaves called it the great\r\nhouse. Some of the slaves ran away and finally reached Ohio. There was\r\nno jail on the plantation. Sometimes the overseer would whip us.\r\n\r\nThe Kings had no overseers. King beat his slaves with a stick. I\r\nremember seeing him do this as well as I can see that house over there.\r\nHe became blind. An owl scratched him in the face when he was trying to\r\ncatch him, and his face got into sich a fix he went to Philadelphia for\r\ntreatment, but they could not cure him. He finally went blind. I have\r\nseen him beat his slaves after he was blind. I remember it well. He beat\r\n'em with a stick. He was the most sensitive man you ever seed. He ran a\r\nstore. After he was blind you could han' him a piece of money and he\r\ncould tell you what it was.\r\n\r\nThere were no churches on the plantation but prayer meeting' were held\r\nin the quarters. Slaves were not allowed to go to the white folk's\r\nchurch unless they were coach drivers, etc. No sir, not in that\r\ncommunity. They taught the slaves the Bible. The children of the marster\r\nwould go to private school. We small Negro children looked after the\r\nbabies in the cradles and other young children. When the white children\r\nstudied their lessons I studied with them. When they wrote in the sand I\r\nwrote in the sand too. The white children, and not the marster or\r\nmistress, is where I got started in learnin' to read and write.\r\n\r\nWe had corn shuckings, candy pullings, dances, prayer meetings. We went\r\nto camp meetin' on Camp Meeting days in August when the crops were laid\r\nby. We played games of high jump, jumping over the pole held by two\r\npeople, wrestling, leap frog, and jumping. We sang the songs, 'Go tell\r\nAunt Patsy'. 'Some folks says a nigger wont steal, I caught six in my\r\ncorn field' 'Run nigger run, the patteroller ketch you, Run nigger run\r\nlike you did the other day'.\r\n\r\nWhen slaves got sick marster looked after them. He gave them blue mass\r\nand caster oil. Dr. McDuffy also treated us. Dr. McSwain vaccinated us\r\nfor small pox. My sister died with it. When the slaves died marster\r\nburied them. They dug a grave with a tomb in it. I do not see any of\r\nthem now. The slaves were buried in a plain box.\r\n\r\nThe marsters married the slaves without any papers. All they did was to\r\nsay perhaps to Jane and Frank, 'Frank, I pronounce you and Jane man and\r\nwife.' But the woman did not take the name of her husband, she kept the\r\nname of the family who owned her.\r\n\r\nI remember seeing the Yankees near Fayetteville. They shot a bomb shell\r\nat Wheeler's Calvary, and it hit near me and buried in the ground.\r\nWheeler's Calvary came first and ramsaked the place. They got all the\r\nvaluables they could, and burned the bridge, the covered bridge over\r\nCape Fear river, but when the Yankees got there they had a pontoon\r\nbridge to cross on,--all those provision wagons and such. When they\r\npassed our place it was in the morning. They nearly scared me to death.\r\nThey passed right by our door, Sherman's army. They began passing, so\r\nthe white folks said, at 9 o'clock in the mornin'. At 9 o'clock at night\r\nthey were passin' our door on foot. They said there were two hundred and\r\nfifty thousan' o' them passed. Some camped in my marster's old fiel'. A\r\nYankee caught one of my marster's shoats and cut off one of the hind\r\nquarters, gave it to me, and told me to carry and give it to my mother.\r\nI was so small I could not tote it, so I drug it to her. I called her\r\nwhen I got in hollering distance of the house and she came and got it.\r\nThe Yankees called us Johnnie, Dinah, Bill and other funny names. They\r\nbeat their drums and sang songs. One of the Yankees sang 'Rock a Bye\r\nBaby'. At that time Jeff Davis money was plentiful. My mother had about\r\n$1000. It was so plentiful it was called Jeff Davis shucks. My mother\r\nhad bought a pair of shoes, and had put them in a chest. A Yankee came\r\nand took the shoes and wore them off, leaving his in their place. They\r\ntol' us we were free. Sometimes the marster would get cruel to the\r\nslaves if they acted like they were free.\r\n\r\nMat Holmes, a slave, was wearing a ball and chain as a punishment for\r\nrunning away. Marster Ezekial King put it on him. He has slept in the\r\nbed with me, wearing that ball and chain. The cuff had embedded in his\r\nleg, it was swollen so. This was right after the Yankees came through.\r\nIt was March, the 9th of March, when the Yankees came through. Mat\r\nHolmes had run away with the ball and chain on him and was in the woods\r\nthen. He hid out staying with us at night until August. Then my mother\r\ntook him to the Yankee garrison at Fayetteville. A Yankee officer then\r\ntook him to a black smith shop and had the ball and chain cut off his\r\nleg. The marsters would tell the slaves to go to work that they were not\r\nfree, that they still belonged to them, but one would drop out and\r\nleave, then another. There was little work done on the farm, and\r\nfinally most of the slaves learned they were free.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln was one of the greatest men that ever lived. He was the\r\ncause of us slaves being free. No doubt about that. I didn't think\r\nanything of Jeff Davis. He tried to keep us in slavery. I think slavery\r\nwas an injustice, not right. Our privilege is to live right, and live\r\naccording to the teachings of the Bible, to treat our fellowman right.\r\nTo do this I feel we should belong to some religious organization and\r\nlive as near right as we know how.\r\n\r\nThe overseers and patterollers in the time of slavery were called poor\r\nwhite trash by the slaves.\r\n\r\nOn the plantations not every one, but some of the slave holders would\r\nhave some certain slave women reserved for their own use. Sometimes\r\nchildren almost white would be born to them. I have seen many of these\r\nchildren. Sometimes the child would be said to belong to the overseer,\r\nand sometimes it would be said to belong to the marster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

As I approached the shack I noticed that the storm had done great\r\ndamage to the chaney-berry tree in her yard, fallen limbs litterin' the\r\nground, which was an inch deep in garbage and water.\r\n\r\nThe porch was littered with old planks and huge tubs and barrels of\r\nstagnant water. There was only room for one chair and in that sat a tall\r\nNegro woman clad in burlap bags and in her lap she held a small white\r\nflea-bitten dog which growled meaningly.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the gate, which swings on one rusty hinge, she bade me\r\ncome in and the Carolina Power and Light Company men, who were at work\r\nnearby, laughed as I climbed over the limbs and garbage and finally\r\nfound room for one foot on the porch and one on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"I wus borned in Mount Airy de year 'fore de Yankees come, bein' de\r\nfourth of five chilluns.

Dere\r\nwus about twenty-five slaves on de plantation whur mother an' me\r\nstayed.\r\n\r\nMarse John used ter take me on his knee an' sing, 'Here is de hammer,\r\nShing ding. Gimme de Hammer, shing ding.' Marster loved de nigger\r\nchilluns on his plantation. When de war ended father come an' lived with\r\nus at Marse John's plantation. Marster John Griffith named me Emmy. My\r\ngrandfather on my fathers side wus named Harden Rand, an' grandmother\r\nwus named Mason Rand. My grandfather on my mother's side wus named Antny\r\nGriffiths an' grandmother wus named Nellie.\r\n\r\nOur food wus a plenty and well cooked. Marster fed his niggers good. We\r\nhad plenty of homespun dresses and we got shoes once a year, at\r\nChristmas Eve. I ken 'member it just as good. We got Christmas Holidays\r\nan' a stockin' full of candy an' peanuts. Sometimes we got ginger snaps\r\nat Christmas. My grandmother cooked' em. She wus a good cook. My\r\nmother's missus wus Miss Jetsy Griffith and my father's missus wus Lucy\r\nRand. Dey wus both mighty good women. You know I am ole. I ken 'member\r\nall dem good white folks. Dey give us Fourth July Holidays. Dey come to\r\ntown on dat day. Dey wore, let me tell you what dey wore, dey wore\r\ndotted waist blouses an' white pants. Dat wus a big day to ever'body, de\r\nFourth of July. Dey begun singing at Auburn an' sung till dey reached\r\nRaleigh. Auburn is nine miles from Raleigh. Dere wus a lot of lemonade.\r\nDey made light bread in big ovens an' had cheese to eat wid it. Some\r\nsaid just goin' on de fofe to git lemonade an' cheese.\r\n\r\nIn the winter we had a lot of possums to eat an' a lot of rabbits too.\r\nAt Christmas time de men hunted and caught plenty game. We barbecued it\r\nbefore de fire. I 'members seein' mother an' grandmother swinging\r\nrabbits 'fore de fire to cook 'em. Dey would turn an' turn 'em till dey\r\nwus done. Dey hung some up in de chimbly an' dry 'em out an' keep 'em a\r\nlong time an' dat is de reason I won't eat a rabbit today. No Sir! I\r\nwon't eat a rabbit. I seed 'em mess wid 'em so much turned me 'ginst\r\neatin' 'em.\r\n\r\nI don't know how much lan' Marster John owned but, Honey, dat wus some\r\nplantation. It reached from Auburn to de Neuse River. Yes Sir, it did,\r\n'cause I been down dere in corn hillin' time an' we fished at twelve\r\no'clock in Neuse River. Marster John had overseers. Dere wus six of 'em.\r\nDey rode horses over de fields but I don't 'member dere names.\r\n\r\nI never seen a slave whupped but dey wus whupped on de plantation an' I\r\nheard de grown folks talkin' 'bout it. My uncles Nat an' Bert Griffiths\r\nwus both whupped. Uncle Nat would not obey his missus rules an' she had\r\nhim whupped. Dey whupped Uncle Bert 'cause he stayed drunk so much. He\r\nloved his licker an' he got drunk an' cut up bad, den dey whupped him.\r\nYou could git plenty whiskey den. Twon't like it is now. No sir, it\r\nwon't. Whiskey sold fur ten cents a quart. Most ever' body drank it but\r\nyou hardly ever seed a man drunk. Slaves wus not whupped for drinkin'.\r\nDere Marsters give 'em whiskey but dey wus whupped for gittin' drunk.\r\nDere wus a jail, a kind of stockade built of logs, on de farm to put\r\nslaves in when dey wouldn't mind. I never say any slave put on de block\r\nan' sold, but I saw Aunt Helen Rand cryin' because her Marster Nat Rand\r\nsold her boy, Fab Rand.\r\n\r\nNo Sir, no readin' an' writin'. You had to work. Ha! ha! You let your\r\nmarster or missus ketch you wid a book. Dat wus a strict rule dat no\r\nlearnin' wus to be teached. I can't read an' write. If it wus not fur my\r\nmother wit don't know what would become of me. We had prayer meetings\r\naround at de slave houses. I 'member it well. We turned down pots on de\r\ninside of de house at de door to keep marster an' missus from hearin' de\r\nsingin' an' prayin'. Marster an' his family lived in de great house an'\r\nde slave quarters wus 'bout two hundred yards away to the back of de\r\ngreat house. Dey wus arranged in rows. When de war ended we all stayed\r\non wid de families Griffiths an' Rands till dey died, dat is all 'cept\r\nmy father an' me. He lef' an' I lef'. I been in Raleigh forty-five\r\nyears. I married Mack Blalock in Raleigh. He been dead seven years.\r\n\r\nMy mother had two boys, Antny an' Wesley. She had four girls, Katie,\r\nGrissie, Mary Ella an' Emma. I had three chilluns, two are livin' yet.\r\nThey both live in Raleigh.\r\n\r\nWe had big suppers an' dinners at log rollin's an' corn shuckin's in\r\nslavery time ha! ha! plenty of corn licker for ever'body, both white an'\r\nblack. Ever'body helped himself. Dr. Tom Busbee, one good ole white man,\r\nlooked after us when we got sick, an' he could make you well purty\r\nquick, 'cause he wus good an' 'cause he wus sorry fer you. He wus a\r\nfeelin' man. Course we took erbs. I tell you what I took. Scurrey grass,\r\nchana balls dey wus for worms. Scurrey grass worked you out. Dey give us\r\nwinter green to clense our blood. We slaves an' a lot of de white folks\r\ndrank sassafras tea in de place of coffee. We sweetened it wid brown\r\nsugar, honey, or molasses, just what we had in dat line. I think slavery\r\nwus a right good thing. Plenty to eat an' wear.\r\n\r\nWhen you gits a tooth pulled now it costs two dollars, don't it? Well\r\nin slavery time I had a tooth botherin' me. My mother say, Emma, take\r\ndis egg an' go down to Doctor Busbee an' give it to him an' git your\r\ntooth pulled. I give him one egg. He took it an' pulled my tooth. Try\r\ndat now, if you wants to an' see what happens. Yes, slavery wus a purty\r\ngood thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District:     No. 2               [320165]\r\nWorker:             Mary A.

Good general story--]\r\n\r\n[HW: Good story\r\nHates the Yankees\r\nboy beaten by overseer who is later discharged;\r\nslaves make pact with Yankees]\r\n\r\nDAYS ON THE PLANTATION\r\n\r\nAs told by Uncle David Blount, formerly of Beaufort County, who did not\r\nknow his age. \"De Marster\" he refers to was Major Wm. A. Blount, who\r\nowned plantations in several parts of North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes mam, de days on de plantation wuz de happy days. De marster made us\r\nwuck through de week but on Sadays we uster go swimmin' in de riber an'\r\ndo a lot of other things dat we lak ter do.\r\n\r\nWe didn't mind de wuck so much case de ground wuz soft as ashes an' de\r\nmarster let us stop and rest when we got tired. We planted 'taters in de\r\nuplan's and co'n in de lowgroun's nex' de riber. It wuz on de Cape Fear\r\nan' on hot days when we wuz a-pullin' de fodder we'd all stop wuck 'bout\r\nthree o'clock in de ebenin' an' go swimmin'. Atter we come out'n de\r\nwater we would wuck harder dan eber an' de marster wuz good to us, case\r\nwe did wuck an' we done what he ast us.\r\n\r\nI 'members onct de marster had a oberseer dar dat wuz meaner dan a mean\r\nnigger. He always hired good oberseers an' a whole lot of times he let\r\nsome Negro slave obersee. Well, dis oberseer beat some of de half grown\r\nboys till de blood run down ter dar heels an' he tole de rest of us dat\r\nif we told on him dat he'd kill us. We don't dasen't ast de marster ter\r\ngit rid of de man so dis went on fer a long time.\r\n\r\nIt wuz cold as de debil one day an' dis oberseer had a gang of us\r\na-clearin' new groun'. One boy ast if he could warm by de bresh heap. De\r\noberseer said no, and atter awhile de boy had a chill. De oberseer don't\r\ncare, but dat night de boy am a sick nigger. De nex' mornin' de marster\r\ngits de doctor, an' de doctor say dat de boy has got pneumonia. He tells\r\n'em ter take off de boys shirt an' grease him wid some tar, turpentine,\r\nan' kerosene, an' when dey starts ter take de shirt off dey fin's dat it\r\nam stuck.\r\n\r\nDey had ter grease de shirt ter git it off case de blood whar de\r\noberseer beat him had stuck de shirt tight ter de skin. De marster wuz\r\nin de room an' he axed de boy how come it, an' de boy tole him.\r\n\r\nDe marster sorta turns white an' he says ter me, 'Will yo' go an' ast\r\nde oberseer ter stop hyar a minute, please?'\r\n\r\nWhen de oberseer comes up de steps he axes sorta sassy-like, 'What yo'\r\nwant?'\r\n\r\nDe marster says, 'Pack yo' things an' git off'n my place as fast as yo'\r\ncan, yo' pesky varmit.'\r\n\r\nDe oberseer sasses de marster some more, an' den I sees de marster\r\nfairly loose his temper for de first time. He don't say a word but he\r\nwalks ober, grabs de oberseer by de shoulder, sets his boot right hard\r\n'ginst de seat of his pants an' sen's him, all drawed up, out in de\r\nyard on his face. He close up lak a umbrella for a minute den he pulls\r\nhisself all tergether an' he limps out'n dat yard an' we ain't neber\r\nseed him no more.\r\n\r\nNo mam, dar wuzent no marryin' on de plantation dem days, an' as one\r\nole 'oman raised all of de chilluns me an' my brother Johnnie ain't\r\nneber knowed who our folkses wuz. Johnnie wuz a little feller when de\r\nwar ended, but I wuz in most of de things dat happen on de plantation\r\nfer a good while.\r\n\r\nOne time dar, I done fergit de year, some white mens comes down de\r\nriber on a boat an' dey comes inter de fiel's an' talks ter a gang of us\r\nan' dey says dat our masters ain't treatin' us right. Dey tells us dat\r\nwe orter be paid fer our wuck, an' dat we hadn't ort ter hab passes ter\r\ngo anywhar. Dey also tells us dat we ort ter be allowed ter tote guns if\r\nwe wants 'em. Dey says too dat sometime our marsters was gwine ter kill\r\nus all.\r\n\r\nI laughs at 'em, but some of dem fool niggers listens ter 'em; an' it\r\n'pears dat dese men gib de niggers some guns atter I left an' promised\r\nter bring 'em some more de nex' week.\r\n\r\nI fin's out de nex' day 'bout dis an' I goes an' tells de marster. He\r\nsorta laughs an' scratches his head, 'Dem niggers am headed fer trouble,\r\nDave, 'he says ter me, 'an I wants yo' ter help me.'\r\n\r\nI says, 'Yas sar, marster.'\r\n\r\nAn' he goes on, 'Yo' fin's out when de rest of de guns comes Dave, an'\r\nlet me know.'\r\n\r\nWhen de men brings back de guns I tells de marster, an' I also tells\r\nhim dat dey wants ter hold er meetin'.\r\n\r\n'All right,' he says an' laughs, 'dey can have de meetin'. Yo' tell\r\n'em, Dave, dat I said dat dey can meet on Chuesday night in de pack\r\nhouse.'\r\n\r\nChuesday ebenin' he sen's dem all off to de low groun's but me, an' he\r\ntells me ter nail up de shutters ter de pack house an' ter nail 'em up\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nI does lak he tells me ter do an' dat night de niggers marches in an'\r\nsneaks dar guns in too. I is lyin' up in de loft an' I hyars dem say dat\r\natter de meetin' dey is gwine ter go up ter de big house an' kill de\r\nwhole fambly.\r\n\r\nI gits out of de winder an' I runs ter de house an tells de marster.\r\nDen me an' him an' de young marster goes out an' quick as lightnin', I\r\nslams de pack house door an' I locks it. Den de marster yells at dem,\r\n'I'se got men an' guns out hyar, he yells, 'an' if yo' doan throw dem\r\nguns out of de hole up dar in de loft, an' throw dem ebery one out I'se\r\ngwine ter stick fire ter dat pack house.'\r\n\r\nDe niggers 'liberates for a few minutes an' den dey throws de guns out.\r\nI knows how many dey has got so I counts till dey throw dem all out, den\r\nI gathers up dem guns an' I totes 'em off ter de big house.\r\n\r\nWell sar, we keeps dem niggers shet up fer about a week on short\r\nrations; an' at de end of dat time dem niggers am kyored for good. When\r\ndey comes out dey had three oberseers 'stid of one, an' de rules am\r\nstricter dan eber before; an' den de marster goes off ter de war.\r\n\r\nI reckon I was 'bout fifteen or sixteen den; an' de marster car's me\r\n'long fer his pusonal sarvant an' body guard an' he leabes de rest of\r\ndem niggers in de fiel's ter wuck like de dickens while I laughs at dem\r\nYankees.\r\n\r\nJim belonged to Mr. Harley who lived in New Hanover County during de\r\nwar, in fac' he was young Massa Harley's slave; so when young Massa Tom\r\nwent to de war Jim went along too.\r\n\r\nDey wuz at Manassas, dey tells me, when Massa Tom got kilt, and de\r\norders wuz not to take no bodies off de field right den.\r\n\r\nCourse ole massa down near Wilmington, doan know 'bout young Massa Tom,\r\nbut one night dey hears Jim holler at de gate. Dey goes runnin' out; an'\r\nJim has brung Massa Tom's body all dat long ways home so dat he can be\r\nburied in de family burian ground.\r\n\r\nDe massa frees Jim dat night; but he stays on a time atter de war, an'\r\ntell de day he died he hated de Yankees for killing Massa Tom. In fact\r\nwe all hated de Yankees, 'specially atter we hear 'bout starve dat first\r\nwinter. I tried ter make a libin' fer me an' Johnnie but it was bad\r\ngoin'; den I comes ter Raleigh an' I gits 'long better. Atter I gits\r\nsettled I brings Johnnie, an' so we done putty good.\r\n\r\nDat's all I can tell yo' now Miss, but if'n yo'll come back sometime\r\nI'll tell yo' de rest of de tales.\r\n\r\nShortly after the above interview Uncle Dave who was failing fast was\r\ntaken to the County Home, where he died.

C. May 13,\r\n1937 by Mary A. Hicks.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wuz borned at Warrenton in Warren County in 1850. My father wuz named\r\nWashington, atter General Washington an' my mamma wuz named Diasia atter\r\na woman in a story. Us an' 'bout forty or fifty other slaves belonged\r\nter Mr. Richard Bobbitt an' we wucked his four hundred acres o' land fer\r\nhim. I jist had one brother named Clay, atter Henry Clay, which shows\r\nhow Massa Dick voted, an' Delilah, which shows dat ole missus read de\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nWe farmed, makin' tobacco, cotton, co'n, wheat an' taters. Massa Dick\r\nhad a whole passel o' fine horses an' our Sunday job wuz ter take care\r\nof 'em, an' clean up round de house. Yes mam, we wucked seben days a\r\nweek, from sunup till sundown six days, an' from seben till three or\r\nfour on a Sunday.\r\n\r\nWe didn't have many tear-downs an' prayer meetin's an' sich, case de\r\nfuss sturbed ole missus who wuz kinder sickly. When we did have sompin'\r\nwe turned down a big wash-pot in front of de do', an' it took up de fuss,\r\nan' folkses in de yard can't hyar de fuss. De patterollers would git\r\nyou iffen you went offen de premises widout a pass, an' dey said dat dey\r\nwould beat you scandelous. I seed a feller dat dey beat onct an' he had\r\nscars as big as my fingers all ober his body.\r\n\r\nI got one whuppin' dat I 'members, an' dat wuz jist a middlin' one. De\r\nmassa told me ter pick de cotton an' I sot down in de middle an' didn't\r\nwuck a speck. De oberseer come an' he frailed me wid a cotton-stalk; he\r\nwuz a heap meaner ter de niggers dan Massa Dick wuz. I saw some niggers\r\nwhat wuz beat bad, but I ain't neber had no bad beatin'.\r\n\r\nWe libed in log houses wid sand floors an' stick an' dirt chimneys an'\r\nwe warn't 'lowed ter have no gyarden, ner chickens, ner pigs. We ain't\r\nhad no way o' makin' money an' de fun wuz only middlin'. We had ter\r\nsteal what rabbits we et from somebody elses [TR correction: else's]\r\nboxes on some udder plantation, case de massa won't let us have none o'\r\nour own, an' we ain't had no time ter hunt ner fish.\r\n\r\nNow talkin' 'bout sompin' dat we'd git a whuppin' fer, dat wuz fer\r\nhavin' a pencil an' a piece of paper er a slate. Iffen you jist looked\r\nlak you wanted ter larn ter read er write you got a lickin'.\r\n\r\nDar wuz two colored women lived nigh us an' dey wuz called \"free\r\nissues,\" but dey wuz really witches. I ain't really seen 'em do nothin'\r\nbut I hyard a whole lot 'bout 'em puttin' spells on folkses an' I seed\r\ntracks whar day had rid Massa Dick's hosses an' eber mo'nin' de hosses\r\nmanes an' tails would be all twisted an' knotted up. I know dat dey done\r\ndat case I seed it wid my own eyes. Dey doctored lots of people an' our\r\nfolkses ain't neber had no doctor fer nothin' dat happen.\r\n\r\nYou wuz axin' 'bout de slave sales, an' I want ter tell you dat I has\r\nseen some real sales an' I'se seed niggers, whole bunches of' em, gwin'\r\nter Richmond ter be sold. Dey wuz mostly chained, case dey wuz new ter\r\nde boss, an' he doan know what ter 'spect. I'se seed some real sales in\r\nWarrenton too, an' de mammies would be sold from deir chilluns an' dare\r\nwould be a whole heap o' cryin' an' mou'nin' 'bout hit. I tell you\r\nfolkses ain't lak dey uster be, 'specially niggers. Uster be when a\r\nnigger cries he whoops an' groans an' hollers an' his whole body rocks,\r\nan' dat am de way dey done sometime at de sales.\r\n\r\nSpeakin' 'bout haints: I'se seed a whole lot o' things, but de worst\r\ndat eber happen wuz 'bout twenty years ago when a han'ts hand hit me\r\nside o' de haid. I bet dat hand weighed a hundred pounds an' it wuz as\r\ncold as ice. I ain't been able ter wuck fer seben days an' nights an' I\r\nstill can't turn my haid far ter de left as you sees.\r\n\r\nI reckon 'bout de funniest thing 'bout our plantation wuz de\r\nmarryin'. A couple got married by sayin' dat dey wuz, but it couldn't\r\nlast fer longer dan five years. Dat wuz so iffen one of 'em got too\r\nweakly ter have chilluns de other one could git him another wife or\r\nhusban'.\r\n\r\nI 'members de day moughty well when de Yankees come. Massa Dick he\r\nwalked de floor an' cussed Sherman fer takin' his niggers away. All o'\r\nde niggers lef', of course, an' me, I walked clean ter Raleigh ter find\r\nout if I wuz really free, an' I couldn't unnerstan' half of it.\r\n\r\nWell de first year I slept in folkses woodhouses an' barns an' in de\r\nwoods or any whar else I could find. I wucked hyar an' dar, but de\r\nfolkses' jist give me sompin' ter eat an' my clothes wuz in strings'\r\nfore de spring o' de year.\r\n\r\nYo' axes me what I thinks of Massa Lincoln? Well, I thinks dat he wuz\r\ndoin' de wust thing dat he could ter turn all dem fool niggers loose\r\nwhen dey ain't got no place ter go an' nothin' ter eat. Who helped us\r\nout den? Hit wuzn't de Yankees, hit wuz de white folkses what wuz left\r\nwid deir craps in de fiel's, an' wuz robbed by dem Yankees, ter boot. My\r\nole massa, fur instance, wuz robbed uv his fine hosses an' his feed\r\nstuff an' all dem kaigs o' liquor what he done make hisself, sides his\r\nmoney an' silver.\r\n\r\nSlavery wuz a good thing den, but de world jist got better an'\r\noutgrowed it.\r\n\r\nEH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

I\r\n'members dat we wucked hard, but we had plenty ter eat an' w'ar, eben\r\niffen we did w'ar wood shoes.\r\n\r\nI kin barely recolleck 'fore de war dat I'se seed a heap o' cocks\r\nfightin' in pits an' a heap o' horse racin'. When de marster winned he\r\n'ud give us niggers a big dinner or a dance, but if he lost, oh!\r\n\r\nMy daddy wus gived ter de doctor when de doctor wus married an' dey\r\nshore loved each other. One day marster, he comes in an' he sez dat de\r\nYankees am aimin' ter try ter take his niggers way from him, but dat dey\r\nam gwine ter ketch hell while dey does hit. When he sez dat he starts\r\nter walkin' de flo'. 'I'se gwine ter leave yore missus in yore keer,\r\nEdwin,' he sez.\r\n\r\nBut pa 'lows, 'Wid all respec' fer yore wife sar, she am a Yankee too,\r\nan' I'd ruther go wid you ter de war. Please sar, massa, let me go wid\r\nyou ter fight dem Yanks.'\r\n\r\nAt fust massa 'fuses, den he sez, 'All right.' So off dey goes ter de\r\nwar, massa on a big hoss, an' my pap on a strong mule 'long wid de\r\nblankets an' things.\r\n\r\nDey tells me dat ole massa got shot one night, an' dat pap grabs de gun\r\n'fore hit hits de earth an' lets de Yanks have hit.\r\n\r\nI 'members dat dem wus bad days fer South Carolina, we gived all o' de\r\nfood ter de soldiers, an' missus, eben do' she has got some Yankee folks\r\nin de war, l'arns ter eat cabbages an' kush an' berries.\r\n\r\nI 'members dat on de day of de surrender, leastways de day dat we hyard\r\n'bout hit, up comes a Yankee an' axes ter see my missus. I is shakin', I\r\nis dat skeerd, but I bucks up an' I tells him dat my missus doan want\r\nter see no blue coat.\r\n\r\nHe grins, an' tells me ter skedaddle, an' 'bout den my missus comes out\r\nan' so help me iffen she doan hug dat dratted Yank. Atter awhile I\r\ngathers dat he's her brother, but at fust I ain't seed no sense in her\r\ncryin' an' sayin' 'thank God', over an' over.\r\n\r\nWell sar, de massa an' pap what had gone off mad an' healthy an' ridin'\r\nfine beastes comes back walkin' an' dey looked sick. Massa am white as\r\ncotton, an' so help me, iffen my pap, who wuz black as sin, ain't pale\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nAtter a few years I goes ter wuck in Spartanburg as a houseboy, den I\r\ngits a job wid de Southern Railroad an' I goes ter Charlotte ter\r\nnight-watch de tracks.\r\n\r\nI stays dar eighteen years, but one night I kills a white hobo who am\r\ntryin' ter rob me o' my gol' watch an' chain, an' dey gives me eighteen\r\nmonths. I'se been hyar six already. He wus a white man, an' jist a boy,\r\nan' I is sorry, but I comes hyar anyhow.\r\n\r\nI hyard a ole 'oman in Charlotte tell onct 'bout witchin' in slavery\r\ntimes, dar in Mecklenburg County. She wus roun' ninety, so I reckon she\r\nknows. She said dat iffen anybody wanted ter be a witch he would draw a\r\ncircle on de groun' jist at de aidge o' dark an' git in de circle an'\r\nsquat down.\r\n\r\nDar he had ter set an' talk ter de debil, an' he mus' say, 'I will have\r\nnothin' ter do wid 'ligion, an' I wants you ter make me a witch.' Atter\r\nday he mus' bile a black cat, a bat an' a bunch of herbs an' drink de\r\nsoup, den he wuz really a witch.\r\n\r\nWhen you wanted ter witch somebody, she said dat you could take dat\r\nstuff, jist a little bit of hit an' put hit under dat puson's doorsteps\r\nan' dey'd be sick.\r\n\r\nYou could go thru' de key hole or down de chimney or through de chinks\r\nin a log house, an' you could ride a puson jist lak ridin' a hoss. Dat\r\npuson can keep you outen his house by layin' de broom 'fore de do' an'\r\nputtin' a pin cushion full of pins side of de bed do', iffen he's a mind\r\nto.\r\n\r\nDat puson can kill you too, by drawin' yore pitcher an' shootin' hit in\r\nde haid or de heart too.\r\n\r\nDar's a heap o' ways ter tell fortunes dat she done tol' me but I'se\r\ndone forgot now 'cept coffee groun's an' a little of de others. You\r\ncan't tell hit wid 'em do', case hit takes knowin' how, hit shore\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District: No. 2                    [320022]\r\nWorker:         T.

Andrews\r\n\r\nANDREW BOONE\r\nage 90 years.\r\n\r\nWake County, North Carolina. Harris Farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nI been living in dese backer barns fifteen years. I built this little\r\nshelter to cook under. Dey cut me off the WPA cause dey said I wus too\r\nole to work. Dey tole us ole folks we need not put down our walkin'\r\nsticks to git work cause dey jes' won't goin' to put us on.\r\n\r\nWell, I had some tomatoes cooked widout any grease for my breakfast. I\r\nhad a loaf of bread yesterday, but I et it. I ain't got any check from\r\nthe ole age pension an' I have nothin' to eat an' I am hongry. I jes'\r\nlooks to God. I set down by de road thinkin' bout how to turn an' what\r\nto do to git a meal, when you cum along. I thanks you fer dis dime. I\r\nguess God made you give it to me.\r\n\r\nI wus glad to take you down to my livin' place to give you my story.\r\nDis shelter, an ole tobacco barn, is better dan no home at all. I is a\r\nman to myself an' I enjoy livin' out here if I could git enough to eat.\r\n\r\nWell de big show is coming to town. It's de Devil's wurk. Yes sir, it's\r\nde Devil's wurk. Why dem show folks ken make snakes an' make 'em crawl\r\ntoo. Dere wus one in Watson Field in de edge of Raleigh not long ago an'\r\nhe made snakes an' made 'em crawl too. All shows is de Devil's wurk.\r\n\r\nI never done anything fer myself in all my life. I always wurked fer de\r\nRebels. I stuck right to 'em. Didn't have no sense fer doin' dat I\r\nguess.\r\n\r\nOne time a Rebel saw a Yankee wid one eye, one leg an' one arm. De\r\nYankee wus beggin'. De Rebel went up to him an' give him a quarter. Den\r\nhe backed off an' jes' stood a-lookin' at de Yankee, presently he went\r\nback an' give him anudder quarter, den anudder, den he said, 'You take\r\ndis whole dollar, you is de first Yankee I eber seed trimmed up jes' to\r\nmy notion, so take all dis, jes' take de whole dollar, you is trimmed up\r\nto my notion'.\r\n\r\nI belonged to Billy Boone in Slavery time. He wus a preacher. He lived\r\non an' owned a plantation in Northampton County. The plantation wus near\r\nwoodland. The nearest river to the place wus the Roanoke. My ole missus'\r\nname wus Nancy. When ole marster died I stayed around wid fust one then\r\nanother of the chilluns, cause marster tole me jes' fore he died fer me\r\nto stay wid any of 'em I wanted to stay with. All dem ole people done\r\ndead an' gone on.\r\n\r\nNiggers had to go through thick an' thin in slavery time, with rough\r\nrations most of de time, wid jes' enough clothin' to make out wid. Our\r\nhouses were built of logs an' covered wid slabs. Dey wus rived out of\r\nblocks of trees about 3-6 and 8ft in length. De chimleys wus built of\r\nsticks and mud, den a coat of clay mud daubed over 'em. De cracks in de\r\nslave houses wus daubed wid mud too.\r\n\r\nWe wurked from sun to sun. If we had a fire in cold weather where we\r\nwus wurkin' marster or de overseer would come an' put it out. We et\r\nfrozen meat an' bread many times in cold weather. After de day's wurk in\r\nde fields wus over we had a task of pickin' de seed from cotton till we\r\nhad two ounces of lint or spin two ounces of cotton on a spinnin' wheel.\r\nI spun cotton on a spinnin' wheel. Dats de way people got clothes in\r\nslavery time.\r\n\r\nI can't read an' write but dey learned us to count. Dey learned us to\r\ncount dis way. 'Ought is an' ought, an' a figger is a figger, all for de\r\nwhite man an' nothin' fer de nigger'. Hain't you heard people count dat\r\nway?\r\n\r\nDey sold slaves jes' like people sell hosses now. I saw a lot of slaves\r\nsold on de auction block. Dey would strip 'em stark naked. A nigger\r\nscarred up or whaled an' welted up wus considered a bad nigger an' did\r\nnot bring much. If his body wus not scarred, he brought a good price. I\r\nsaw a lot of slaves whupped an' I was whupped myself. Dey whupped me wid\r\nde cat o' nine tails. It had nine lashes on it. Some of de slaves wus\r\nwhupped wid a cabbin paddle. Dey had forty holes in' em an' when you wus\r\nbuckled to a barrel dey hit your naked flesh wid de paddle an' every\r\nwhur dere wus a hole in de paddle it drawed a blister. When de whuppin'\r\nwid de paddle wus over, dey took de cat o' nine tails an' busted de\r\nblisters. By dis time de blood sometimes would be runnin' down dere\r\nheels. Den de next thing wus a wash in salt water strong enough to hold\r\nup an egg. Slaves wus punished dat way fer runnin' away an' sich.\r\n\r\nIf you wus out widout a pass dey would shore git you. De paterollers\r\nshore looked after you. Dey would come to de house at night to see who\r\nwus there. If you wus out of place, dey would wear you out.\r\n\r\nSam Joyner, a slave, belonged to marster. He wus runnin' from de\r\npaterollers an' he fell in a ole well. De pateroller went after marster.\r\nMarster tole' em to git ole Sam out an' whup him jes' as much as dey\r\nwanted to. Dey got him out of de well an' he wus all wet an' muddy. Sam\r\nbegan takin' off his shoes, den he took off his pants an' got in his\r\nshirt tail. Marster, he say, 'What you takin' off you clothes fer Sam?'\r\nSam, he say, 'Marster, you know you all can't whup dis nigger right over\r\nall dese wet clothes.' Den Sam lit out. He run so fas' he nearly flew.\r\nDe paterollers got on dere hosses an' run him but dey could not ketch\r\nhim. He got away. Marster got Sam's clothes an' carried 'em to de house.\r\nSam slipped up next morning put his clothes on an' marster said no more\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nI wus a great big boy when de Yankees come through. I wus drivin' a two\r\nmule team an' doin' other wurk on de farm. I drove a two hoss wagon when\r\ndey carried slaves to market. I went to a lot of different places.\r\n\r\nMy marster wus a preacher, Billy Boone. He sold an' bought niggers. He\r\nhad fifty or more. He wurked the grown niggers in two squads. My father\r\nwus named Isham Boone and my mother wus Sarah Boone. Marster Boone\r\nwhupped wid de cobbin paddle an' de cat o' nine tails an' used the salt\r\nbath an' dat wus 'nough. Plenty besides him whupped dat way.\r\n\r\nMarster had one son, named Solomon, an' two girls, Elsie an' Alice. My\r\nmother had four children, three boys an' one girl. The boys were named\r\nSam, Walter and Andrew, dats me, an' de girl wus Cherry.\r\n\r\nMy father had several children cause he had several women besides\r\nmother. Mollie and Lila Lassiter, two sisters, were also his women.\r\nDese women wus given to him an' no udder man wus allowed to have\r\nanything to do wid 'em. Mollie an' Lila both had chilluns by him. Dere\r\nnames wus Jim, Mollie, Liza, Rosa, Pete an' I can't remember no more of\r\n'em.\r\n\r\nDe Yankees took jes' what dey wanted an' nothin' stopped 'em, cause de\r\nsurrender had come. Before de surrender de slave owners begun to scatter\r\nde slaves 'bout from place to place to keep de Yankees from gittin' 'em.\r\nIf de Yankees took a place de slaves nearby wus moved to a place further\r\noff.\r\n\r\nAll I done wus fer de Rebels. I wus wid 'em an' I jes' done what I wus\r\ntole. I wus afraid of de Yankees 'cause de Rebels had told us dat de\r\nYankees would kill us. Dey tole us dat de Yankees would bore holes in\r\nour shoulders an' wurk us to carts. Dey tole us we would be treated a\r\nlot worser den dey wus treating us. Well, de Yankees got here but they\r\ntreated us fine. Den a story went round an' round dat de marster would\r\nhave to give de slaves a mule an' a year's provisions an' some lan',\r\nabout forty acres, but dat was not so. Dey nebber did give us anything.\r\nWhen de war ended an' we wus tole we wus free, we stayed on wid marster\r\ncause we had nothin' an' nowhere to go.\r\n\r\nWe moved about from farm to farm. Mother died an' father married Maria\r\nEdwards after de surrender. He did not live wid any of his other slave\r\nwives dat I knows of.\r\n\r\nI have wurked as a han' on de farm most of de time since de surrender\r\nand daddy worked most of de time as a han', but he had gardens an'\r\npatches most everywhere he wurked. I wurked in New York City for fifteen\r\nyears with Crawford and Banhay in de show business. I advertised for\r\n'em. I dressed in a white suit, white shirt, an' white straw hat, and\r\nwore tan shoes. I had to be a purty boy. I had to have my shoes shined\r\ntwice a day. I lived at 18 Manilla Lane, New York City. It is between\r\nMcDougall Street and 6th Avenue. I married Clara Taylor in New York\r\nCity. We had two children. The oldest one lives in New York. The other\r\ndied an' is buried in Raleigh.\r\n\r\nIn slavery time they kept you down an' you had to wurk, now I can't\r\nwurk, an' I am still down. Not allowed to wurk an' still down. It's all\r\nhard, slavery and freedom, both bad when you can't eat. The ole bees\r\nmakes de honey comb, the young bee makes de honey, niggers makes de\r\ncotton an' corn an' de white folks gets de money. Dis wus de case in\r\nSlavery time an' its de case now. De nigger do mos' de hard wurk on de\r\nfarms now, and de white folks still git de money dat de nigger's labor\r\nmakes.\r\n\r\nLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE EDITORIAL IDENTIFICATION FORM     [320002]\r\n\r\nSTATE:         North Carolina\r\nRECEIVED FROM: (State office) Asheville\r\nMS:            Interview with W. L. Bost, Ex-Slave.\r\nWORDS:         2,000\r\nDATE:          Sept. 27, 1937\r\n\r\nInterview with W. L. Bost, Ex-slave [HW: 88 years]\r\n63 Curve Street,\r\nAsheville, N. C.\r\n\r\nBy--Marjorie Jones\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Massa's name was Jonas Bost. He had a hotel in Newton, North\r\nCarolina. My mother and grandmother both belonged to the Bost family. My\r\nole Massa had two large plantations one about three miles from Newton\r\nand another four miles away. It took a lot of niggers to keep the work a\r\ngoin' on them both. The women folks had to work in the hotel and in the\r\nbig house in town. Ole Missus she was a good woman. She never allowed\r\nthe Massa to buy or sell any slaves. There never was an overseer on the\r\nwhole plantation. The oldest colored man always looked after the\r\nniggers. We niggers lived better than the niggers on the other\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nLord child, I remember when I was a little boy, 'bout ten years, the\r\nspeculators come through Newton with droves of slaves. They always stay\r\nat our place. The poor critters nearly froze to death. They always come\r\n'long on the last of December so that the niggers would be ready for\r\nsale on the first day of January. Many the time I see four or five of\r\nthem chained together. They never had enough clothes on to keep a cat\r\nwarm. The women never wore anything but a thin dress and a petticoat and\r\none underwear. I've seen the ice balls hangin' on to the bottom of their\r\ndresses as they ran along, jes like sheep in a pasture 'fore they are\r\nsheared. They never wore any shoes. Jes run along on the ground, all\r\nspewed up with ice. The speculators always rode on horses and drove the\r\npore niggers. When they get cold, they make 'em run 'til they are warm\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe speculators stayed in the hotel and put the niggers in the quarters\r\njes like droves of hogs. All through the night I could hear them\r\nmournin' and prayin'. I didn't know the Lord would let people live who\r\nwere so cruel. The gates were always locked and they was a guard on the\r\noutside to shoot anyone who tried to run away. Lord miss, them slaves\r\nlook jes like droves of turkeys runnin' along in front of them horses.\r\n\r\nI remember when they put 'em on the block to sell 'em. The ones 'tween\r\n18 and 30 always bring the most money. The auctioneer he stand off at a\r\ndistance and cry 'em off as they stand on the block. I can hear his\r\nvoice as long as I live.\r\n\r\nIf the one they going to sell was a young Negro man this is what he say:\r\n\"Now gentlemen and fellow-citizens here is a big black buck Negro. He's\r\nstout as a mule. Good for any kin' o' work an' he never gives any\r\ntrouble. How much am I offered for him?\" And then the sale would\r\ncommence, and the nigger would be sold to the highest bidder.\r\n\r\nIf they put up a young nigger woman the auctioneer cry out: \"Here's a\r\nyoung nigger wench, how much am I offered for her?\" The pore thing\r\nstand on the block a shiverin' an' a shakin' nearly froze to death. When\r\nthey sold many of the pore mothers beg the speculators to sell 'em with\r\ntheir husbands, but the speculator only take what he want. So meybe the\r\npore thing never see her husban' agin.\r\n\r\nOle' Massa always see that we get plenty to eat. O' course it was no\r\nfancy rashions. Jes corn bread, milk, fat meat, and 'lasses but the Lord\r\nknows that was lots more than other pore niggers got. Some of them had\r\nsuch bad masters.\r\n\r\nUs pore niggers never 'lowed to learn anything. All the readin' they\r\never hear was when they was carried through the big Bible. The Massa say\r\nthat keep the slaves in they places. They was one nigger boy in Newton\r\nwho was terrible smart. He learn to read an' write. He take other\r\ncolored children out in the fields and teach 'em about the Bible, but\r\nthey forgit it 'fore the nex' Sunday.\r\n\r\nThen the paddyrollers they keep close watch on the pore niggers so they\r\nhave no chance to do anything or go anywhere. They jes' like policemen,\r\nonly worser. 'Cause they never let the niggers go anywhere without a\r\npass from his master. If you wasn't in your proper place when the\r\npaddyrollers come they lash you til' you was black and blue. The women\r\ngot 15 lashes and the men 30. That is for jes bein' out without a pass.\r\nIf the nigger done anything worse he was taken to the jail and put in\r\nthe whippin' post. They was two holes cut for the arms stretch up in\r\nthe air and a block to put your feet in, then they whip you with cowhide\r\nwhip. An' the clothes shore never get any of them licks.\r\n\r\nI remember how they kill one nigger whippin' him with the bull whip.\r\nMany the pore nigger nearly killed with the bull whip. But this one die.\r\nHe was a stubborn Negro and didn't do as much work as his Massa thought\r\nhe ought to. He been lashed lot before. So they take him to the whippin'\r\npost, and then they strip his clothes off and then the man stan' off and\r\ncut him with the whip. His back was cut all to pieces. The cuts about\r\nhalf inch apart. Then after they whip him they tie him down and put salt\r\non him. Then after he lie in the sun awhile they whip him agin. But when\r\nthey finish with him he was dead.\r\n\r\nPlenty of the colored women have children by the white men. She know\r\nbetter than to not do what he say. Didn't have much of that until the\r\nmen from South Carolina come up here and settle and bring slaves. Then\r\nthey take them very same children what have they own blood and make\r\nslaves out of them. If the Missus find out she raise revolution. But she\r\nhardly find out. The white men not going to tell and the nigger women\r\nwere always afraid to. So they jes go on hopin' that thing won't be that\r\nway always.\r\n\r\nI remember how the driver, he was the man who did most of the whippin',\r\nuse to whip some of the niggers. He would tie their hands together and\r\nthen put their hands down over their knees, then take a stick and stick\r\nit 'tween they hands and knees. Then when he take hold of them and beat\r\n'em first on one side then on the other.\r\n\r\nUs niggers never have chance to go to Sunday School and church. The\r\nwhite folks feared for niggers to get any religion and education, but I\r\nreckon somethin' inside jes told us about God and that there was a\r\nbetter place hereafter. We would sneak off and have prayer meetin'.\r\nSometimes the paddyrollers catch us and beat us good but that didn't\r\nkeep us from tryin'. I remember one old song we use to sing when we meet\r\ndown in the woods back of the barn. My mother she sing an' pray to the\r\nLord to deliver us out o' slavery. She always say she thankful she was\r\nnever sold from her children, and that our Massa not so mean as some of\r\nthe others. But the old song it went something like this:\r\n\r\n     \"Oh, mother lets go down, lets go down, lets go down, lets go down.\r\n     Oh, mother lets go down, down in the valley to pray.\r\n     As I went down in the valley to pray\r\n     Studyin' about that good ole way\r\n     Who shall wear that starry crown.\r\n     Good Lord show me the way.\"\r\n\r\nThen the other part was just like that except it said 'father' instead\r\nof 'mother', and then 'sister' and then 'brother'.\r\n\r\nThen they sing sometime:\r\n\r\n     \"We camp a while in the wilderness, in the wilderness, in the\r\n        wilderness.\r\n     We camp a while in the wilderness, where the Lord makes me happy\r\n     And then I'm a goin' home.\"\r\n\r\nI don't remember much about the war. There was no fightin' done in\r\nNewton. Jes a skirmish or two. Most of the people get everything jes\r\nready to run when the Yankee sojers come through the town. This was\r\ntoward the las' of the war. Cose the niggers knew what all the fightin'\r\nwas about, but they didn't dare say anything. The man who owned the\r\nslaves was too mad as it was, and if the niggers say anything they get\r\nshot right then and thar. The sojers tell us after the war that we get\r\nfood, clothes, and wages from our Massas else we leave. But they was\r\nvery few that ever got anything. Our ole Massa say he not gwine pay us\r\nanything, corse his money was no good, but he wouldn't pay us if it had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nThen the Ku Klux Klan come 'long. They were terrible dangerous. They\r\nwear long gowns, touch the ground. They ride horses through the town at\r\nnight and if they find a Negro that tries to get nervy or have a little\r\nbit for himself, they lash him nearly to death and gag him and leave him\r\nto do the bes' he can. Some time they put sticks in the top of the tall\r\nthing they wear and then put an extra head up there with scary eyes and\r\ngreat big mouth, then they stick it clear up in the air to scare the\r\npoor Negroes to death.\r\n\r\nThey had another thing they call the 'Donkey Devil' that was jes as bad.\r\nThey take the skin of a donkey and get inside of it and run after the\r\npore Negroes. Oh, Miss them was bad times, them was bad times. I know\r\nfolks think the books tell the truth, but they shore don't. Us pore\r\nniggers had to take it all.\r\n\r\nThen after the war was over we was afraid to move. Jes like tarpins or\r\nturtles after 'mancipation. Jes stick our heads out to see how the land\r\nlay. My mammy stay with Marse Jonah for 'bout a year after freedom then\r\nole Solomon Hall made her an offer. Ole man Hall was a good man if there\r\never was one. He freed all of his slaves about two years 'fore\r\n'mancipation and gave each of them so much money when he died, that is\r\nhe put that in his will. But when he die his sons and daughters never\r\ngive anything to the pore Negroes. My mother went to live on the place\r\nbelongin' to the nephew of Solomon Hall. All of her six children went\r\nwith her. Mother she cook for the white folks an' the children make\r\ncrop. When the first year was up us children got the first money we had\r\nin our lives. My mother certainly was happy.\r\n\r\nWe live on this place for over four years. When I was 'bout twenty year\r\nold I married a girl from West Virginia but she didn't live but jes\r\n'bout a year. I stayed down there for a year or so and then I met\r\nMamie. We came here and both of us went to work, we work at the same\r\nplace. We bought this little piece of ground 'bout forty-two years ago.\r\nWe gave $125 for it. We had to buy the lumber to build the house a\r\nlittle at a time but finally we got the house done. Its been a good home\r\nfor us and the children. We have two daughters and one adopted son. Both\r\nof the girls are good cooks. One of them lives in New Jersey and cooks\r\nin a big hotel. She and her husband come to see us about once a year.\r\nThe other one is in Philadelphia. They both have plenty. But the adopted\r\nboy, he was part white. We took him when he was a small and did the best\r\nwe could by him. He never did like to 'sociate with colored people. I\r\nremember one time when he was a small child I took him to town and the\r\nconductor made me put him in the front of the street car cause he\r\nthought I was just caring for him and that he was a white boy. Well, we\r\nsent him to school until he finished. Then he joined the navy. I ain't\r\nseem him in several years. The last letter I got from him he say he\r\nain't spoke to a colored girl since he has been there. This made me mad\r\nso I took his insurance policy and cashed it. I didn't want nothin' to\r\ndo with him, if he deny his own color.\r\n\r\nVery few of the Negroes ever get anywhere; they never have no education.\r\nI knew one Negro who got to be a policeman in Salisbury once and he was\r\na good one too. When my next birthday comes in December I will be\r\neighty-eight years old. That is if the Lord lets me live and I shore\r\nhope He does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

I was nine years ole at de surrender.\r\n\r\nMy mammy an' pappy, Susan an' Lillman Graves, first belonged to Marse\r\nFountain an' Mis' Fanny Tu'berville, but Marse Fountain sold me, my\r\nmammy an' my brother George to Mis' Fanny's sister, Mis' Virginia\r\nGraves. Mis' Virginia's husban' was Marse Doctor Graves. Dey lived on de\r\nole Elijah Graves estate not far from Marse Fountain's plantation here\r\nin Durham county, an' Mis' Virginia an' Mis' Fanny seed each other near\r\n'bout every day.\r\n\r\nI was little when Marse Fountain an' Marse Doctor went to de war but I\r\nremembers it. I remembers it kaze Mis' Fanny stood on de po'ch smilin'\r\nan' wavin' at Marse Fountain 'til he went 'roun' de curve in de road,\r\nden she fell to de floor like she was dead. I thought she was dead 'till\r\nMis' Virginia th'owed some water in her face an' she opened her eyes.\r\n\r\nDe nex day Mis' Virginia took me an' mammy an' we all went over an'\r\nstayed wid Mis' Fanny kaze she was skeered, an' so dey'd be company for\r\neach other. Mammy waited on Mis' Virginia an' he'ped Surella\r\nTu'berville, Mis' Fanny's house girl, sweep an' make up de beds an'\r\nthings. I was little but mammy made me work. I shook de rugs, brung in\r\nde kindlin' an run 'roun' waitin' on Mis' Virginia an' Mis' Fanny, doin'\r\nthings like totin' dey basket of keys, bringin' dey shawls and such as\r\ndat. Dey was all de time talkin' about de folks fightin' an' what dey\r\nwould do if de Yankees come.\r\n\r\nEvery time dey talk Mis' Fanny set an' twist her han's an' say: \"What is\r\nwe gwine do, Sister, what is we gwine do?\"\r\n\r\nMis' Virginia try to pacify Mis' Fanny. She say, 'Don' yo' worry none,\r\nHoney, I'll fix dem Yankees when dey come.' Den she set her mouf. When\r\nshe done dat I run an' hid behin' Mis' Fanny's chair kaze I done seed\r\nMis' Virginia set her mouf befo' an' I knowed she meant biznes'.\r\n\r\nI didn' have sense enough to be skeered den kaze I hadn' never seed no\r\nYankee sojers, but 'twaren't long befo' I wuz skeered. De Yankees come\r\none mornin', an' dey ripped, Oh, Lawd, how dey did rip. When dey rode up\r\nto de gate an' come stompin' to de house, Mis' Fanny 'gun to cry. 'Tell\r\ndem somethin', Sister, tell dem somethin'; she tole Mis' Virginia.\r\n\r\nMis' Virginia she ain' done no cryin'. When she seed dem Yankees comin'\r\n'cross de hill, she run 'roun' an' got all de jewelry. She took off de\r\nrings an' pins she an' Mis' Fanny had on an' she got all de things out\r\nof de jewelry box an' give dem to pappy. \"Hide dem, Lillmam\" she tole\r\npappy, 'hide dem some place whare dem thieves won't find dem'.\r\n\r\nPappy had on high top boots. He didn' do nothin but stuff all dat\r\njewelry right down in dem boots, den he strutted all' roun' dem Yankees\r\nlaughin' to heself. Dey cussed when dey couldn' fin' no jewelry a tall.\r\nDey didn' fin' no silver neither kaze us niggers done he'p Mis' Fanny\r\nan' Mis' Virginia hide dat. We done toted it all down to de cottin gin\r\nhouse an' hid it in de loose cotton piled on de floor. When dey couldn'\r\nfin' nothin' a big sojer went up to Mis' Virginia who wuz standin' in de\r\nhall. He look at her an' say: 'Yo's skeered of me, ain' yo'?'\r\n\r\nMis' Virginia ain' batted no eye yet. She tole him, \"If I was gwine to\r\nbe skeered, I'd be skeered of somethin'. I sho ain' of no ugly, braggin'\r\nYankee.\"\r\n\r\nDe man tu'ned red an he say: \"If you don' tell me where you done hide\r\ndat silver I'se gwine to make' you skeered.\"\r\n\r\nMis' Virginia's chin went up higher. She set her mouf an' look at dat\r\nsojer twell he drap his eyes. Den she tole him dat some folks done come\r\nan' got de silver, dat dey done toted it off. She didn' tell him dat it\r\nwuz us niggers dat done toted it down to de cotton gin house.\r\n\r\nIn dem days dey wuz peddlers gwine 'roun' de country sellin'\r\nthings. Dey toted big packs on dey backs filled wid everythin'\r\nfrom needles an' thimbles to bed spreads an' fryin' pans. One day\r\na peddler stopped at Mis' Fanny's house. He was de uglies' man\r\nI ever seed. He was tall an' bony wid black whiskers an' black\r\nbushy hair an' curious eyes dat set way back in his head. Dey\r\nwas dark an' look like a dog's eyes after you done hit him. He\r\nset down on de po'ch an' opened his pack, an' it was so hot an'\r\nhe looked so tired, dat Mis' Fanny give him er cool drink of milk\r\ndat done been settin' in de spring house. All de time Mis' Fanny\r\nwas lookin' at de things in de pack an' buyin', de man kept up a\r\nrunnin' talk. He ask her how many niggers dey had; how many men\r\ndey had fightin' on de 'Federate side, an' what wuz was she gwine do\r\nif de niggers wuz was set free. Den he ask her if she knowed Mistah\r\nAbraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\n'Bout dat time Mis' Virginia come to de door an' heard what he said. She\r\nblaze up like a lightwood fire an' told dat peddler dat dey didn't want\r\nto know nothin' 'bout Mistah Lincoln; dat dey knowed too much already,\r\nan' dat his name wuzn [HW correction: wasn't] 'lowed called in dat [HW\r\ncorrection: her] house. Den she say he wuzn [HW correction: wasn't]\r\nnothin' but a black debil messin' in other folks biznes' [HW correction:\r\nbusiness], an' dat she'd shoot him on sight if she had half a chance.\r\n\r\nDe man laughed. \"Maybe he [HW correction: Mr. Lincoln] ain't so bad,' he\r\ntold her. Den he packed his pack an' went off down de road, an' Mis'\r\nVirginia watched him 'till he went out of sight 'roun' de bend.\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three weeks later Mis' Fanny got a letter. De letter was from dat\r\npeddler. He tole her dat he was Abraham Lincoln hese'f; dat he wuz\r\npeddlin' over de country as a spy, an' he thanked her for de res' on her\r\nshady po'ch an' de cool glass of milk she give him.\r\n\r\nWhen dat letter come Mis' Virginia got so hoppin' mad dat she took all\r\nde stuff Mis' Fanny done bought from Mistah Lincoln an' made us niggers\r\nburn it on de ash pile. Den she made pappy rake up de ashes an' th'ow\r\ndem in de creek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District:     No. 2               [320148]\r\nWorker:             Mary A.

Bloodworth\r\nStreet, Raleigh, North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wus borned in Georgia eighty years ago, de son of Jim an' Henretta\r\nBurnett an' de slave of Marse William Joyner.\r\n\r\nI wurked on de farm durin' slavery times, among de cotton, corn, an'\r\nsugar cane. De wurk wusn't so hard an' we had plenty of time ter have\r\nfun an' ter git inter meanness, dat's why Marse William had ter have so\r\nmany patterollers on de place.\r\n\r\nMarse William had near three hundret slaves an' he kept seben\r\npatterollers ter keep things goin' eben. De slaves ain't run away. Naw\r\nsir, dey ain't, dey knows good things when dey sees dem an' dey ain't\r\nleavin' dem nother. De only trouble wus dat dey wus crazy 'bout good\r\ntimes an' dey'd shoot craps er bust.\r\n\r\nDe patterollers 'ud watch all de paths leadin' frum de plantation an'\r\nwhen dey ketched a nigger leavin' dey whupped him an' run him home. As I\r\nsaid de patterollers watched all paths, but dar wus a number of little\r\npaths what run through de woods dat nobody ain't watched case dey ain't\r\nknowed dat de paths wus dar.\r\n\r\nOn moonlight nights yo' could hear a heap of voices an' when yo' peep\r\nober de dike dar am a gang of niggers a-shootin' craps an' bettin'\r\neber'thing dey has stold frum de plantation. Sometimes a pretty yaller\r\ngal er a fat black gal would be dar, but mostly hit would be jist men.\r\n\r\nDar wus a ribber nearby de plantation an' we niggers swum dar ever'\r\nSadday an' we fished dar a heap too. We ketched a big mess of fish ever'\r\nweek an' dese come in good an' helped ter save rations ter boot. Dat's\r\nwhat Marse William said, an' he believed in havin' a good time too.\r\n\r\nWe had square dances dat las' all night on holidays an' we had a\r\nChristmas tree an' a Easter egg hunt an' all dat, case Marse William\r\nintended ter make us a civilized bunch of blacks.\r\n\r\nMarse William ain't eber hit one of us a single lick till de day when\r\nwe heard dat de Yankees wus a-comin'. One big nigger jumps up an'\r\nsqualls, 'Lawd bless de Yankees'.\r\n\r\nMarse yells back, 'God damn de Yankees', an' he slaps big Mose a\r\nsumerset right outen de do'. Nobody else wanted ter git slapped soe\r\never'body got outen dar in a hurry an' nobody else dasen't say Yankees\r\nter de marster.\r\n\r\nEben when somebody seed de Yankees comin' Mose wont go tell de' marster\r\n'bout hit, but when Marster William wus hilt tight twixt two of dem big\r\nhusky Yankees he cussed 'em as hard as he can. Dey carries him off an'\r\ndey put him in de jail at Atlanta an' dey keeps him fer a long time.\r\n\r\nAtter de surrender we left dar an' we moves ter Star, South Carolina,\r\nwhar I still wurks 'roun' on de farm. I stayed on dar' till fifty years\r\nago when I married Roberta Thomas an' we moved ter Raliegh. We have five\r\nchilluns an' we's moughty proud of 'em, but since I had de stroke we has\r\nbeen farin' bad, an' I'se hopin' ter git my ole aged pension.\r\n\r\nEH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

Dey had 'bout three hundred niggahs an' mos' of dem\r\nworked in de cotton fields.\r\n\r\nMarse Jordan wuz hard on his niggahs. He worked dem over time an' didn'\r\ngive den enough to eat. Dey didn' have good clothes neither an' dey\r\nshoes wuz made out of wood. He had 'bout a dozen niggahs dat didn' do\r\nnothin' else but make wooden shoes for de slaves. De chillun didn' have\r\nno shoes a tall; dey went barefooted in de snow an' ice same as 'twuz\r\nsummer time. I never had no shoes on my feets 'twell I wuz pas' ten\r\nyears ole, an' dat wuz after de Yankees done set us free.\r\n\r\nI wuz skeered of Marse Jordan, an' all of de grown niggahs wuz too 'cept\r\nLeonard an' Burrus Allen. Dem niggahs wuzn' skeered of nothin'. If de\r\ndebil hese'f had come an' shook er stick at dem dey'd hit him back.\r\nLeonard wuz er big black buck niggah; he wuz de bigges niggah I ever\r\nseed, an' Burrus wuz near 'bout as big, an' dey 'spized Marse Jordan\r\nwus'n pizen.\r\n\r\nI wuz sort of skeered of Mis' Polly too. When Marse Jordan wuzn' 'roun'\r\nshe wuz sweet an' kind, but when he wuz 'roun', she wuz er yes, suh,\r\nyes, suh, woman. Everythin' he tole her to do she done. He made her slap\r\nMarmy one time kaze when she passed his coffee she spilled some in de\r\nsaucer. Mis' Sally hit Mammy easy, but Marse Jordan say: 'Hit her,\r\nSally, hit de black bitch like she 'zerve to be hit.' Den Mis' Sally\r\ndraw back her hand an' hit Mammy in de face, pow, den she went back to\r\nher place at de table an' play like she eatin' her breakfas'. Den when\r\nMarse Jordan leave she come in de kitchen an' put her arms 'roun' Mammy\r\nan' cry, an' Mammy pat her on de back an' she cry too. I loved Mis'\r\nSally when Marse Jordan wuzn' 'roun'.\r\n\r\nMarse Jordan's two sons went to de war; dey went all dressed up in dey\r\nfightin' clothes. Young Marse Jordan wuz jus' like Mis' Sally but Marse\r\nGregory wuz like Marse Jordan, even to de bully way he walk. Young Marse\r\nJordan never come back from de war, but 'twould take more den er bullet\r\nto kill Marse Gregory; he too mean to die anyhow kaze de debil didn'\r\nwant him an' de Lawd wouldn' have him.\r\n\r\nOne day Marse Gregory come home on er furlo'. He think he look pretty\r\nwid his sword clankin' an' his boots shinin'. He wuz er colonel,\r\nlootenent er somethin'. He wuz struttin' 'roun' de yard showin' off,\r\nwhen Leonard Allen say under his breath, 'Look at dat God damn sojer. He\r\nfightin' to keep us niggahs from bein' free.'\r\n\r\n'Bout dat time Marse Jordan come up. He look at Leonard an' say: 'What\r\nyo' mumblin' 'bout?'\r\n\r\nDat big Leonard wuzn' skeered. He say, I say, 'Look at dat God damn\r\nsojer. He fightin' to keep us niggahs from bein' free.'\r\n\r\nMarse Jordan's face begun to swell. It turned so red dat de blood near\r\n'bout bust out. He turned to Pappy an' tole him to go an' bring him dis\r\nshot gun. When Pappy come back Mis' Sally come wid him. De tears wuz\r\nstreamin' down her face. She run up to Marse Jordan an' caught his arm.\r\nOle Marse flung her off an' took de gun from Pappy. He leveled it on\r\nLeonard an' tole him to pull his shirt open. Leonard opened his shirt\r\nan' stood dare big as er black giant sneerin' at Ole Marse.\r\n\r\nDen Mis' Sally run up again an' stood 'tween dat gun an' Leonard.\r\n\r\nOle Marse yell to pappy an' tole him to take dat woman out of de way,\r\nbut nobody ain't moved to touch Mis' Sally, an' she didn' move neither,\r\nshe jus' stood dare facin' Ole Marse. Den Ole Marse let down de gun. He\r\nreached over an' slapped Mis' Sally down, den picked up de gun an' shot\r\ner hole in Leonard's ches' big as yo' fis'. Den he took up Mis' Sally\r\nan' toted her in de house. But I wuz so skeered dat I run an' hid in de\r\nstable loft, an' even wid my eyes shut I could see Leonard layin' on de\r\ngroun' wid dat bloody hole in his ches' an' dat sneer on his black mouf.\r\n\r\nAfter dat Leonard's brother Burrus hated Ole Marse wus' er snake, den\r\none night he run away. Mammy say he run away to keep from killin' Ole\r\nMarse. Anyhow, when Ole Marse foun' he wuz gone, he took er bunch of\r\nniggahs an' set out to find him. All day long dey tromped de woods, den\r\nwhen night come dey lit fat pine to'ches an' kept lookin', but dey\r\ncouldn' find Burrus. De nex' day Ole Marse went down to de county jail\r\nan' got de blood houn's. He brung home er great passel of dem yelpin'\r\nan' pullin' at de ropes, but when he turned dem loose dey didn' find\r\nBurrus, kaze he done grease de bottom of his feets wid snuff an' hog\r\nlard so de dogs couldn' smell de trail. Ole Marse den tole all de\r\nniggahs dat if anybody housed an' fed Burrus on de sly, dat he goin' to\r\nshoot dem like he done shot Leonard. Den he went every day an' searched\r\nde cabins; he even looked under de houses.\r\n\r\nOne day in 'bout er week Mis' Sally wuz feedin' de chickens when she\r\nheard somethin' in de polk berry bushes behin' de hen house. She didn'\r\ngo 'roun' de house but she went inside house an' looked through de\r\ncrack. Dare wuz Burrus layin' down in de bushes. He wuz near 'bout\r\nstarved kaze he hadn' had nothin' to eat since he done run away.\r\n\r\nMis' Sally whisper an' tole him to lay still, dat she goin' to slip him\r\nsomethin' to eat. She went back to de house an' made up some more cawn\r\nmeal dough for de chickens, an' under de dough she put some bread an'\r\nmeat. When she went 'cross de yard she met Marse Jordan. He took de pan\r\nof dough an' say he goin' to feed de chickens. My mammy say dat Mis'\r\nSally ain't showed no skeer, she jus' smile at Ole Marse an' pat his\r\narm, den while she talk she take de pan an' go on to de chicken house,\r\nbut Ole Marse he go too. When dey got to de hen house Ole Marse puppy\r\nbegun sniffin' 'roun'. Soon he sta'ted to bark; he cut up such er fuss\r\ndat Ole Marse went to see what wuz wrong. Den he foun' Burrus layin' in\r\nde polk bushes.\r\n\r\nOle Marse drag Burrus out an' drove him to de house. When Mis' Sally\r\nseed him take out his plaited whip, she run up stairs an' jump in de bed\r\nan' stuff er pillow over her head.\r\n\r\nDey took Burrus to de whippin' post. Dey strip off his shirt, den dey\r\nput his head an' hands through de holes in de top, an' tied his feets to\r\nde bottom, den, Ole Marse took de whip. Dat lash hiss like col' water on\r\ner red hot iron when it come through de air, an' every time it hit\r\nBurrus it lef' er streak of blood. Time Ole Marse finish, Burrus' back\r\nlook like er piece of raw beef.\r\n\r\nDey laid Burrus face down on er plank den dey poured turpentine in all\r\ndem cut places. It burned like fire but dat niggah didn' know nothin'\r\n'bout it kaze he done passed out from pain. But, all his life dat black\r\nman toted dem scares on his back.\r\n\r\nWhen de war ended Mis' Sally come to Mammy an' say: 'Fanny, I's sho glad\r\nyo's free. Yo' can go now an' yo' won' ever have to be er slave no\r\nmore.'\r\n\r\nBut Mammy, she ain't had no notion of leavin' Mis' Sally. She put her\r\narms' roun' her an' call her Baby, an' tell her she goin' to stay wid\r\nher long as she live. An' she did stay wid her. Me an' Mammy bof stayed\r\nMis' Sally 'twell she died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District: No. 3                   [320193]\r\nField Worker:   Esther S.

Three miles north of\r\nBethania, the second oldest settlement of the \"Unitas Fratrum\" in\r\nWachovia, lies the 1500 acre Jones plantation. It has been owned for\r\nseveral generations by the one family, descendants of Abraham Conrad.\r\nConrad's daughter, Julia, married a physician of note, Dr. Beverly\r\nJones, whose family occupied the old homestead at the time of the Civil\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nHere, in 1856, was born a negro girl, Betty, to a slave mother. Here,\r\ntoday, under the friendly protection of this same Jones family,\r\nsurrounded by her sons and her sons' sons, lives this same Betty in her\r\nown little weather-stained cottage. Encircling her house are lilacs,\r\nalthea, and flowering trees that soften the bleak outlines of unpainted\r\nout-buildings. A varied collection of old-fashioned plants and flowers\r\ncrowd the neatly swept dooryard. A friendly German-shepherd puppy rouses\r\nfrom his nap on the sunny porch to greet visitors enthusiastically. In\r\nanswer to our knock a gentle voice calls, \"Come in.\" The door opens\r\ndirectly into a small, low-ceilinged room almost filled by two double\r\nbeds. These beds are conspicuously clean and covered by homemade\r\ncrocheted spreads. Wide bands of hand-made insertion ornament the\r\nstiffly starched pillow slips. Against the wall is a plain oak dresser.\r\nAlthough the day is warm, two-foot logs burn on the age-worn andirons of\r\nthe wide brick fire place. From the shelf above dangles a leather bag\r\nof \"spills\" made from twisted newspapers.\r\n\r\nIn a low, split-bottom chair, her rheumatic old feet resting on the warm\r\nbrick hearth, sits Aunt Betty Cofer. Her frail body stoops under the\r\nweight of four-score years but her bright eyes and alert mind are those\r\nof a woman thirty years younger. A blue-checked mob cap covers her\r\ngrizzled hair. Her tiny frame, clothed in a motley collection of\r\nundergarments, dress, and sweaters, is adorned by a clean white apron.\r\nAlthough a little shy of her strange white visitors, her innate dignity,\r\ngentle courtesy, and complete self possession indicate long association\r\nwith \"quality folks.\"\r\n\r\nHer speech shows a noticeable freedom from the usual heavy negro dialect\r\nand idiom of the deep south. \"Yes, Ma'am, yes, Sir, come in. Pull a\r\nchair to the fire. You'll have to 'scuse me. I can't get around much,\r\n'cause my feet and legs bother me, but I got good eyes an' good ears an'\r\nall my own teeth. I aint never had a bad tooth in my head. Yes'm, I'm\r\n81, going on 82. Marster done wrote my age down in his book where he\r\nkep' the names of all his colored folks. Muh (Mother) belonged to Dr.\r\nJones but Pappy belonged to Marse Israel Lash over yonder. (Pointing\r\nnorthwest.) Younguns always went with their mammies so I belonged to the\r\nJoneses.\r\n\r\n\"Muh and Pappy could visit back and forth sometimes but they never lived\r\ntogether 'til after freedom. Yes'm, we was happy. We got plenty to eat.\r\nMarster and old Miss Julia (Dr. Jones' wife, matriarch of the whole\r\nplantation) was mighty strict but they was good to us. Colored folks on\r\nsome of the other plantations wasn't so lucky. Some of' em had\r\noverseers, mean, cruel men. On one plantation the field hands had to\r\nhustle to git to the end of the row at eleven o'clock dinner-time\r\n'cause when the cooks brought their dinner they had to stop just where\r\nthey was and eat, an' the sun was mighty hot out in those fields. They\r\nonly had ash cakes (corn pone baked in ashes) without salt, and molasses\r\nfor their dinner, but we had beans an' grits an' salt an' sometimes\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\n\"I was lucky. Miss Ella (daughter of the first Beverly Jones) was a\r\nlittle girl when I was borned and she claimed me. We played together an'\r\ngrew up together. I waited on her an' most times slept on the floor in\r\nher room. Muh was cook an' when I done got big enough I helped to set\r\nthe table in the big dinin' room. Then I'd put on a clean white apron\r\nan' carry in the victuals an' stand behind Miss Ella's chair. She'd fix\r\nme a piece of somethin' from her plate an' hand it back over her\r\nshoulder to me (eloquent hands illustrate Miss Ella's making of a\r\nsandwich.) I'd take it an' run outside to eat it. Then I'd wipe my mouth\r\nan' go back to stand behind Miss Ella again an' maybe get another snack.\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm, there was a crowd of hands on the plantation. I mind 'em all an'\r\nI can call most of their names. Mac, Curley, William, Sanford, Lewis,\r\nHenry, Ed, Sylvester, Hamp, an' Juke was the men folks. The women was\r\nNellie, two Lucys, Martha, Nervie, Jane, Laura, Fannie, Lizzie, Cassie,\r\nTensie, Lindy, an' Mary Jane. The women mostly, worked in the house.\r\nThere was always two washwomen, a cook, some hands to help her, two\r\nsewin' women, a house girl, an' some who did all the weavin' an'\r\nspinnin'. The men worked in the fields an' yard. One was stable boss an'\r\nlooked after all the horses an' mules. We raised our own flax an'\r\ncotton an' wool, spun the thread, wove the cloth, made all the clothes.\r\nYes'm, we made the mens' shirts an' pants an' coats. One woman knitted\r\nall the stockin's for the white folks an' colored folks too. I mind she\r\nhad one finger all twisted an' stiff from holdin' her knittin' needles.\r\nWe wove the cotton an' linen for sheets an' pillow-slips an' table\r\ncovers. We wove the wool blankets too. I use to wait on the girl who did\r\nthe weavin' when she took the cloth off the loom she done give me the\r\n'thrums' (ends of thread left on the loom.) I tied 'em all together with\r\nteensy little knots an' got me some scraps from the sewin' room and I\r\nmade me some quilt tops. Some of 'em was real pretty too! (Pride of\r\nworkmanship evidenced by a toss of Betty's head.)\r\n\r\n\"All our spinnin' wheels and flax wheels and looms was hand-made by a\r\nwheel wright, Marse Noah Westmoreland. He lived over yonder. (A thumb\r\nindicates north.) Those old wheels are still in the family'. I got one\r\nof the flax wheels. Miss Ella done give it to me for a present. Leather\r\nwas tanned an' shoes was made on the place. 'Course the hands mostly\r\nwent barefoot in warm weather, white chillen too. We had our own mill to\r\ngrind the wheat and corn an' we raised all our meat. We made our own\r\ncandles from tallow and beeswax. I 'spect some of the old candle moulds\r\nare over to 'the house' now. We wove our own candle wicks too. I never\r\nsaw a match 'til I was a grown woman. We made our fire with flint an'\r\npunk (rotten wood). Yes'm, I was trained to cook an' clean an' sew. I\r\nlearned to make mens' pants an' coats. First coat I made, Miss Julia\r\ntold me to rip the collar off, an' by the time I picked out all the\r\nteensy stitches an' sewed it together again I could set a collar right!\r\nI can do it today, too! (Again there is manifested a good workman's\r\npardonable pride of achievement)\r\n\r\n\"Miss Julia cut out all the clothes herself for men and women too. I\r\n'spect her big shears an' patterns an' old cuttin' table are over at the\r\nhouse now. Miss Julia cut out all the clothes an' then the colored girls\r\nsewed 'em up but she looked 'em all over and they better be sewed right!\r\nMiss Julia bossed the whole plantation. She looked after the sick folks\r\nand sent the doctor (Dr. Jones) to dose 'em and she carried the keys to\r\nthe store-rooms and pantries. [HW: paragraph mark here.] Yes'm, I'm\r\nsome educated. Muh showed me my 'a-b-abs' and my numbers and when I was\r\nfifteen I went to school in the log church built by the Moravians. They\r\ngive it to the colored folks to use for their own school and church.\r\n(This log house is still standing near Bethania). Our teacher was a\r\nwhite man, Marse Fulk. He had one eye, done lost the other in the war.\r\nWe didn't have no colored teachers then. They wasn't educated. We\r\n'tended school four months a year. I went through the fifth reader, the\r\n'North Carolina Reader'. I can figger a little an' read some but I can't\r\nwrite much 'cause my fingers 're--all stiffened up. Miss Julia use to\r\nread the bible to us an' tell us right an' wrong, and Muh showed me all\r\nshe could an' so did the other colored folks. Mostly they was kind to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, I don't know much about spells an' charms. Course most of the\r\nold folks believed in 'em. One colored man use to make charms, little\r\nbags filled with queer things. He called 'em 'jacks' an' sold 'em to the\r\ncolored folks an' some white folks too.\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm, I saw some slaves sold away from the plantation, four men and\r\ntwo women, both of 'em with little babies. The traders got 'em. Sold 'em\r\ndown to Mobile, Alabama. One was my pappy's sister. We never heard from\r\nher again. I saw a likely young feller sold for $1500. That was my Uncle\r\nIke. Marse Jonathan Spease bought him and kept him the rest of his life.\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm, we saw Yankee soldiers. (Stoneman's Cavalry in 1865.) They come\r\nmarchin' by and stopped at 'the house. I wasn't scared 'cause they was\r\nall talkin' and laughin' and friendly but they sure was hongry. They\r\ndumped the wet clothes out of the big wash-pot in the yard and filled it\r\nwith water. Then they broke into the smokehouse and got a lot of hams\r\nand biled 'em in the pot and ate 'em right there in the yard. The women\r\ncooked up a lot of corn pone for 'em and coffee too. Marster had a\r\nbarrel of 'likker' put by an' the Yankees knocked the head in an' filled\r\ntheir canteens. There wasn't ary drop left. When we heard the soldiers\r\ncomin' our boys turned the horses loose in the woods. The Yankees said\r\nthey had to have 'em an' would burn the house down if we didn't get 'em.\r\nSo our boys whistled up the horses an' the soldiers carried 'em all off.\r\nThey carried off ol' Jennie mule too but let little Jack mule go. When\r\nthe soldiers was gone the stable boss said,'if ol' Jennie mule once gits\r\nloose nobody on earth can catch her unless she wants. She'll be back!'\r\nSure enough, in a couple of days she come home by herself an' we worked\r\nthe farm jus' with her an' little Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the colored folks followed the Yankees away. Five or six of our\r\nboys went. Two of 'em travelled as far as Yadkinville but come back. The\r\nrest of 'em kep' goin' an' we never heard tell of' em again.\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm, when we was freed Pappy come to get Muh and me. We stayed around\r\nhere. Where could we go? These was our folks and I couldn't go far away\r\nfrom Miss Ella. We moved out near Rural Hall (some 5 miles from\r\nBethania) an' Pappy farmed, but I worked at the home place a lot. When I\r\nwas about twenty-four Marse R. J. Reynolds come from Virginia an' set up\r\na tobacco factory. He fotched some hands with 'im. One was a likely\r\nyoung feller, named Cofer, from Patrick County, Virginia. I liked 'im\r\nan' we got married an' moved back here to my folks.(the Jones family) We\r\nstarted to buy our little place an' raise a family. I done had four\r\nchillen but two's dead. I got grandchillen and great-grandchillen close\r\nby. This is home to us. When we talk about the old home place (the Jones\r\nresidence, now some hundred years old) we just say 'the house' 'cause\r\nthere's only one house to us. The rest of the family was all fine folks\r\nand good to me but I loved Miss Ella better'n any one or anythin' else\r\nin the world. She was the best friend I ever had. If I ever wanted for\r\nanythin' I just asked her an she give it to me or got it for me somehow.\r\nOnce when Cofer was in his last sickness his sister come from East\r\nLiverpool, Ohio, to see 'im. I went to Miss Ella to borrow a little\r\nmoney. She didn't have no change but she just took a ten dollar bill\r\nfrom her purse an' says 'Here you are, Betty, use what you need and\r\nbring me what's left'.\r\n\r\n\"I always did what I could for her too an' stood by her--but one time.\r\nThat was when we was little girls goin' together to fetch the mail. It\r\nwas hot an' dusty an' we stopped to cool off an' wade in the 'branch'.\r\nWe heard a horse trottin' an' looked up an' there was Marster switchin'\r\nhis ridin' whip an' lookin' at us. 'Git for home, you two, and I'll\r\n'tend to you,' he says, an' we got! But this time I let Miss Ella go to\r\n'the house' alone an' I sneaked aroun' to Granny's cabin an' hid. I was\r\nafraid I'd git whupped! 'Nother time, Miss Ella went to town an' told me\r\nto keep up her fire whilst she was away. I fell asleep on the hearth and\r\nthe fire done burnt out so's when Miss Ella come home the room was cold.\r\nShe was mad as hops. Said she never had hit me but she sure felt like\r\ndoin' it then.\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm, I been here a right smart while. I done lived to see three\r\ngenerations of my white folks come an' go, an' they're the finest folks\r\non earth. There use to be a reg'lar buryin' ground for the plantation\r\nhands. The colored chillen use to play there but I always played with\r\nthe white chillen. (This accounts for Aunt Betty's gentle manner and\r\nspeech.) Three of the old log cabins (slave cabins) is there yet. One of\r\n'em was the 'boys cabin'. (house for boys and unmarried men) They've got\r\nwalls a foot thick an' are used for store-rooms now. After freedom we\r\nburied out around our little churches but some of th' old grounds are\r\nplowed under an' turned into pasture cause the colored folks didn't get\r\nno deeds to 'em. It won't be long 'fore I go too but I'm gwine lie near\r\nmy old home an' my folks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm, I remember Marse Israel Lash, my Pappy's Marster. He was a low,\r\nthick-set man, very jolly an' friendly. He was real smart an' good too,\r\n'cause his colored folks all loved 'im. He worked in the bank an' when\r\nthe Yankees come, 'stead of shuttin' the door 'gainst 'em like the\r\nothers did, he bid 'em welcome. (Betty's nodding head, expansive smile\r\nand wide-spread hands eloquently pantomime the banker's greeting.) So\r\nthe Yankees done took the bank but give it back to 'im for his very own\r\nan' he kep' it but there was lots of bad feelin' 'cause he never give\r\nfolks the money they put in the old bank. (Possibly this explains the\r\nclosing of the branch of the Cape Fear Bank in Salem and opening of\r\nIsrael Lash's own institution, the First National Bank of Salem, 1866.)\r\n\r\n\"I saw General Robert E. Lee, too. After the war he come with some\r\nfriends to a meeting at Five Forks Baptist Church. All the white folks\r\ngathered 'round an' shook his hand an' I peeked 'tween their legs an'\r\ngot a good look at' im. But he didn't have no whiskers, he was\r\nsmooth-face! (Pictures of General Lee all show him with beard and\r\nmustache)\r\n\r\n\"Miss Ella died two years ago. I was sick in the hospital but the doctor\r\ncome to tell me. I couldn't go to her buryin'. I sure missed her.\r\n(Poignant grief moistens Betty's eyes and thickens her voice). There\r\nwasn't ever no one like her. Miss Kate an' young Miss Julia still live\r\nat 'the house' with their brother, Marse Lucian (all children of the\r\nfirst Beverly Jones and 'old Miss Julia',) but it don't seem right with\r\nMiss Ella gone. Life seems dif'rent, some how, 'though there' lots of my\r\nyoung white folks an' my own kin livin' round an' they're real good to\r\nme. But Miss Ella's gone!\r\n\r\n\"Goodday, Ma'am. Come anytime. You're welcome to. I'm right glad to have\r\nvisitors 'cause I can't get out much.\" A bobbing little curtsy\r\naccompanies Betty's cordial farewell.\r\n\r\nAlthough a freed woman for 71 years, property owner for half of them,\r\nand now revered head of a clan of self respecting, self-supporting\r\ncolored citizens, she is still at heart a \"Jones negro,\" and all the\r\ndistinguished descendants of her beloved Marse Beverly and Miss Julia\r\nwill be her \"own folks\" as long as she lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

In late afternoon he was found sitting on the doorsteps of his\r\ngranddaughter's house after a supper which certainly had onions on the\r\nmenu and was followed by something stronger than water.\r\n\r\n\"I was borned on March 1, 1852 in Orange County.

Hicks with Willis Cozart of Zebulon, (Wake Co.\r\nN. C.) Age 92. May 12, 1937.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo mam, Mistress, I doan want ter ride in no automobile, thank you,\r\nI'se done walked these three miles frum Zebulon an' walkin' is what has\r\nkept me goin' all dese years.\r\n\r\nYes'm I'se a bachelor an' I wuz borned on June 11, 1845 in Person\r\nCounty. My papa wuz named Ed an' my maw wuz named Sally. Dar wuz ten of\r\nus youngins, Morris, Dallas, Stephen, Jerry, Florence, Polly, Lena,\r\nPhillis, Caroline, an' me. Mr. Starling Oakley of Person County, near\r\nRoxboro wuz my master an' as long as him an' ole mistress lived I went\r\nback ter see dem.\r\n\r\nHe wuz right good to de good niggers an' kinder strick wid de bad ones.\r\nPusonly he ain't never have me whupped but two or three times. You's\r\nhyard 'bout dese set down strikes lately, well dey ain't de fust ones.\r\nOnct when I wuz four or five years old, too little to wuck in de fiel's,\r\nmy master sot me an' some more little chilluns ter wuck pullin' up weeds\r\nroun' de house. Well, I makes a speech and I tells dem le's doan wuck\r\nnone so out we sprawls on de grass under de apple tree. Atter awhile ole\r\nmaster found us dar, an' when he fin's dat I wuz de ring-leader he\r\ngives me a little whuppin'.\r\n\r\nHit wuz a big plantation, round 1,200 acres o' land, I reckon, an' he\r\nhad 'bout seventy or eighty slaves to wuck de cotton, corn, tobacco an'\r\nde wheat an' vege'bles. De big house wuz sumpin to look at, but de slave\r\ncabins wuz jist log huts wid sand floors, and stick an' dirt chimneys.\r\nWe wuz 'lowed ter have a little patch o' garden stuff at de back but no\r\nchickens ner pigs. De only way we had er' makin' money wuz by pickin'\r\nberries an' sellin' 'em. We ain't had much time to do dat, case we\r\nwucked frum sunup till sundown six days a week.\r\n\r\nDe master fed us as good as he knowed how, but it wuz mostly on bread,\r\nmeat, an' vege'bles.\r\n\r\nI 'members seberal slave sales whar dey sold de pappy or de mammy 'way\r\nfrum de chillums an' dat wuz a sad time. Dey led dem up one at de time\r\nan' axed dem questions an' dey warn't many what wuz chained, only de bad\r\nones, an' sometime when dey wuz travelin' it wuz necessary to chain a\r\nnew gang.\r\n\r\nI'se seed niggers beat till da blood run, an' I'se seed plenty more wid\r\nbig scars, frum whuppin's but dey wuz de bad ones. You wuz whupped\r\n'cordin ter de deed yo' done in dem days. A moderate whuppin' wuz\r\nthirty-nine or forty lashes an' a real whuppin' wuz a even hundred; most\r\nfolks can't stand a real whuppin'.\r\n\r\nFrum all dis you might think dat we ain't had no good times, but we had\r\nour co'n shuckin's, candy pullin's an' sich like. We ain't felt like\r\nhuntin' much, but I did go on a few fox hunts wid de master. I uster go\r\nfishin' too, but I ain't been now since 1873, I reckon. We sometimes\r\nwent ter de neighborhood affairs if'n we wuz good, but if we wuzn't an'\r\ndidn't git a pass de patter-rollers would shore git us. When dey got\r\nthrough whuppin' a nigger he knowed he wuz whupped too.\r\n\r\nDe slave weddin's in dat country wuz sorta dis way: de man axed de\r\nmaster fer de 'oman an' he jist told dem ter step over de broom an' dat\r\nwuz de way dey got married dem days; de pore white folks done de same\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAtter de war started de white folks tried ter keep us niggers frum\r\nknowin' 'bout it, but de news got aroun' somehow, an' dar wuz some talk\r\nof gittin' shet of de master's family an' gittin' rich. De plans didn't\r\n'mout to nothin' an' so de Yankees come down.\r\n\r\nI 'members moughty well when de Yankees come through our country. Dey\r\nstold ever'thing dey could find an' I 'members what ole master said. He\r\nsays, 'Ever' one dat wants ter wuck fer me git in de patch ter pullin'\r\ndat forty acres of fodder an' all dat don't git up de road wid dem d----\r\nYankees.' Well we all went away.\r\n\r\nDat winter wuz tough, all de niggers near 'bout starved ter death, an'\r\nwe ain't seed nothin' of de forty acres of land an' de mule what de\r\nYankees done promise us nother. Atter awhile we had ter go ter our ole\r\nmasters an' ax 'em fer bread ter keep us alive.\r\n\r\nDe Klu Klux Klan sprung right up out of de earth, but de Yankees put a\r\nstop ter dat by puttin' so many of dem in jail. Dey do say dat dat's\r\nwhat de State Prison wus built fer.\r\n\r\nI never believed in witches an' I ain't put much stock in hain'ts but\r\nI'se seed a few things durin' my life dat I can't 'splain, like de thing\r\nwid de red eyes dat mocked me one night; but shucks I ain't believin' in\r\ndem things much.

I wuz born on John William Walton's\r\nplantation 4 miles from Garner and 13 miles from Raleigh, N. C. in the\r\nCounty of Wake. I am 84 years ole the 2nd day uv dis las' gone March. I\r\nbelonged to Mr. John William Walton in slavery time. My missus wuz named\r\nMiss Martha.\r\n\r\nMy father wuz named Frank Walton. My mother wuz named Flora Walton.\r\nGrandma wuz 104 years when she died. She died down at de old plantation.\r\nMy brothers were named Johnnie and Lang. My sisters were Adeline,\r\nViolet, Mary, Sarah, Ellen, and Annie. Four of us are livin', Ellen,\r\nMary, Sarah and me.\r\n\r\nDe old boss man wuz good to us. I wuz talkin' about him the udder\r\nnight. He didn't whup us and he said, he didn't want nobody else to whup\r\nus. It is jis like I tell you; he wuz never cruel to us. One uv his sons\r\nwuz cruel to us. We had a plenty to eat, we shore did, plenty to eat. We\r\nhad nice houses to live in too. Grandma had a large room to live in, and\r\nwe had one to live in. Daddy stayed at home with mother. They worked\r\ntheir patches by moonlight; and worked for the white folks in the day\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThey sold what they made. Marster bought it and paid for it. He made a\r\nbarrel o' rice every year, my daddy did.\r\n\r\nMr. Bell Allen owned slaves too. He had a plenty o' niggers. His\r\nplantation wuz 5 miles from ourn. We went to church at the white folks\r\nchurch. When Mr. Bell Allen seed us cummin' he would say, 'Yonder comes\r\nJohn Walton's free niggers.'\r\n\r\nOur marster would not sell his slaves. He give dem to his children when\r\nthey married off do'. I swept yards, churned, fed the chickens. In de\r\nebening I would go with my missus a fishin'. We eat collards, peas, corn\r\nbread, milk, and rice. We got biskit and butter twice a week. I thought\r\ndat de best things I ever et wuz butter spread on biskit. We had a corn\r\nmill and a flour mill on the plantation. There wuz about 24 slaves on de\r\nplace. Dey had brandy made on de plantation, and de marster gib all his\r\nslaves some for dere own uses.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother and mother wove our clothes. Dey were called homespun.\r\nDey made de shoes on de plantation too. I wuz not married til atter de\r\nsurrender. I did not dress de finest in the world; but I had nice\r\nclothes. My wedding dress wuz made of cream silk, made princess with\r\npink and cream bows. I wore a pair of morocco store bought shoes. My\r\nhusband was dressed in a store bought suit of clothes, the coat wuz made\r\npigen [HW correction: pigeon] tail. He had on a velvet vest and a white\r\ncollar and tie. Somebody stole de ves' atter dat.\r\n\r\nOne of our master's daughters wuz cruel. Sometimes she would go out\r\nand rare on us, but old marster didn't want us whupped.\r\n\r\nOur great grand mother wuz named granny Flora. Dey stole her frum\r\nAfrica wid a red pocket handkerchief. Old man John William got my great\r\ngrandmother. De people in New England got scured of we niggers. Dey were\r\nafrid me would rise aginst em and dey pushed us on down South. Lawd, why\r\ndidn't dey let us stay whur we wuz, dey nebber wouldn't a been so menny\r\nhalf white niggers, but the old marster wuz to blame for that.\r\n\r\nWe never saw any slaves sold. They carried them off to sell 'em. The\r\nslaves travelled in droves. Fathers and mothers were sold from their\r\nchilluns. Chilluns wuz sold from their parents on de plantations close\r\nto us. Where we went to church, we sat in a place away from de white\r\nfolks. The slaves never did run away from marster, because he wuz good\r\nto 'em; but they run away from other plantations.\r\n\r\nYes, we seed the patterollers, we called 'em pore white trash, we also\r\ncalled patterollers pore white pecks. They had ropes around their necks.\r\nThey came to our house one night when we were singin' and prayin'. It\r\nwuz jist before the surrender. Dey were hired by de slave owner. My\r\ndaddy told us to show 'em de brandy our marster gib us, den dey went on\r\na way, kase dey knowed John Walton wuz a funny man about his slaves. Dey\r\ngave us Christmas and other holidays. Den dey, de men, would go to see\r\ndere wives. Some of the men's wives belong to other marsters on other\r\nplantations. We had corn shuckin's at night, and candy pullin's.\r\nSometimes we had quiltings and dances.\r\n\r\nOne of the slaves, my aint, she wuz a royal slave. She could dance all\r\nover de place wid a tumbler of water on her head, widout spilling it.\r\nShe sho could tote herself. I always luved to see her come to church.\r\nShe sho could tote herself.\r\n\r\nMy oldest sister Violet died in slavery time. She wuz ten years old\r\nwhen she died. Her uncles were her pall bearers. Uncle Hyman and Uncle\r\nHandy carried her to the grave yard. If I makes no mistake my daddy made\r\nher coffin. Dere wuz no singin'. There were seven of the family dere,\r\ndat wuz all. Dey had no funeral. Dere were no white folks dere.\r\n\r\nDey baptized people in creeks and ponds.\r\n\r\nWe rode corn stalks, bent down small pine trees and rode' em for\r\nhorses. We also played prison base. Colored and white played, yes sir,\r\nwhites and colored. We played at night but we had a certain time to go\r\nto bed. Dat wuz nine o'clock. [HW: New paragraph indicated]\r\n\r\nDe boss man looked atter us when we wuz sick. He got doctors. I had the\r\ntyphoid fever. All my hair came out. Dey called it de \"mittent fever.\"\r\nDr. Thomas Banks doctored me. He been dead a long time. Oh! I don't know\r\nhow long he been dead. Near all my white folks were found dead. Mr. John\r\ndied outside.\r\n\r\nWalton died in bed. Marster Joe Walton died sitting under a tree side de\r\npath. Miss Hancey died in bed.\r\n\r\nI 'member the day de war commenced. My marster called my father and my\r\ntwo uncles Handy and Hyman, our marster called 'em. Dey had started back\r\nto the field to work in the afternoon. He said, 'Cum here boys,' that\r\nwuz our young marster, Ben Walton, says 'cum here boys. I got sumptin'\r\nto tell you.' Uncle Hyman said, 'I can't. I got to go to work.' He said\r\n'Come here and set down, I got sumptin' to tell you.'\r\n\r\nThe niggers went to him and set down. He told them; 'There is a war\r\ncommenced between the North and the South. If the North whups you will\r\nbe as free a man as I is. If the South whups you will be a slave all\r\nyour days.'\r\n\r\nMr. Joe Walton said when he went to war dat dey could eat breakfast at\r\nhome, go and whup the North, and be back far dinner. He went away, and it\r\nwuz four long years before he cum back to dinner. De table wuz shore set\r\na long time for him. A lot of de white folks said dey wouldn't be much\r\nwar, dey could whup dem so easy. Many of dem never did come back to\r\ndinner. I wuz afraid of the Yankees because Missus had told us the\r\nYankees were going to kill every nigger in the South. I hung to my mammy\r\nwhen dey come through.\r\n\r\nI thought Abraham Lincoln wuz the Medicine man, with grip in his han',\r\ncause he said every borned man must be free.\r\n\r\nI did not think anything of Jeff Davis. I thank de will of God for\r\nsetting us free. He got into Abraham Lincoln and the Yankees. We are\r\nthankful to the Great Marster dat got into Lincoln and the Yankees. Dey\r\nsay Booker Washington wuz fine, I don't know.\r\n\r\nThe white folks did not allow us to have nuthing to do wid books. You\r\nbetter not be found, tryin' to learn to read. Our marster wuz harder\r\ndown on dat den anything else. You better not be ketched wid a book. Day\r\nread the Bible and told us to obey our marster for de Bible said obey\r\nyour marster.\r\n\r\nThe first band of music I ever herd play the Yankees wuz playin' it.\r\nThey were playin' a song. 'I am tired of seeing de homespun dresses the\r\nsouthern women wear'.\r\n\r\nI thinks Mr. Roosevelt is a fine man. Jus' what we need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

Cabarrus Street\r\n\r\n\r\nI wont nuthin' in slavery time and I aint nuthin' now. All de work I am\r\nable ter do now is a little work in de garden. Dey say I is too ole ter\r\nwork, so charity gives me a little ter go upon every week. For one weeks\r\n'lowance o' sumptin' ter eat dey gives me, hold on, I will show you, dat\r\nbeats guessin'. Here it is: 1/2 peck meal (corn meal), 2 lbs oat meal, 2\r\nlb dry skim milk, and 1 lb plate meat. Dis is what I gits fer one week\r\n'lowance. I can't work much, but de white folks gib me meals fur washin'\r\nde woodwork in dere houses, de white folks in Hayes's Bottom. What\r\nlittle I do, I does fer him. He gives me meals for workin'. De charity\r\ngives me about 80 cts worth o' rations a week.\r\n\r\nI wus seven years old when de Yankees come through. All de niggers\r\n'cept me an' de white folks ran to de woods. I didn't have sense enough\r\nter run, so I stayed on de porch where dey were passin' by. One of 'em\r\npointed his gun at me. I remember it as well as it was yisterday. Yes\r\nsir, I seed de Yankees and I remember de clothes dey wore. Dey were blue\r\nand dere coats had capes on' em and large brass buttons. De niggers and\r\nwhite folks were afraid of' em. De ole house where dey came by, an' me\r\non de porch is still standin', yes sir, and dey are livin' in it now. It\r\nbelongs to Ralph Crowder, and he has a fellow by de name o' Edward, a\r\ncolored man, livin' dere now. De house is de udder side o' Swift Creek,\r\nright at Rands Mill. I belonged ter ole man William Crowder durin'\r\nslavery, Tom Crowder's daddy. Ralph is Tom's son. My missus wus named\r\nMiss Melvina an' if I lives ter be a hundred years old I will never\r\nforget dem white folks. Yes sir, dey shore wus good ter us. We had good\r\nfood, good clothes and a good place ter sleep.\r\n\r\nMy mother died before de war, but Miss Melvina wus so good ter us we\r\ndidn't know so much difference. Mother wus de first person I remember\r\nseein' dead. When she died Miss Melvina, marster's wife, called us\r\nchillun in and says, 'Chillun your mother is dead, but anything in dis\r\nkitchen you wants ter eat go take it, but don't slip nuthin'. If you slip\r\nit you will soon be stealin' things.' I had four brothers and one\r\nsister, and none of us never got into trouble 'bout stealin'. She taught\r\nus ter let other people's things alone.\r\n\r\nMy father wus named Waddy Crowder. My mother wus named Neelie Crowder.\r\nGrandpa was named Jacob Crowder and grandma was named Sylvia Crowder. I\r\nknow dem jist as good as if it wus yisterday.\r\n\r\nNever went ter school a day in my life. I can't read an' write. Dey\r\nwould not 'low slaves ter have books, no sir reee, no, dat dey wouldn't.\r\nWe went wid de white folks to church; dey were good ter us, dat's de\r\ntruth. Dere aint many people dat knows 'bout dem good times. Dey had a\r\nlot o' big dinners and when de white folks got through I would go up and\r\neat all I wanted.\r\n\r\nI 'member choppin' cotton on Clabber branch when I wus a little boy\r\nbefore de surrender. When de surrender come I didn't like it. Daddy an'\r\nde udders didn't like it, 'cause after de surrender dey had to pay\r\nmarster fer de meat an' things. Before dat dey didn't have nuthin' to do\r\nbut work. Dere were eight slaves on de place in slavery time. Clabber\r\nbranch run into Swift Creek. Lord have mercy, I have caught many a fish\r\non dat branch. I also piled brush in de winter time. Birds went in de\r\nbrush ter roost. Den we went bird blindin'. We had torches made o'\r\nlightwood splinters, and brushes in our han's, we hit de piles o' brush\r\nafter we got 'round 'em. When de birds come out we would kill 'em. Dere\r\nwere lots o' birds den. We killed' em at night in the sage fields[5]\r\nwhere broom grass was thick. Dem were de good times. No sich times now.\r\nWe killed robins, doves, patridges and other kinds o' birds. Dey aint\r\nno such gangs o' birds now. We briled 'em over coals o' fire and fried\r\n'em in fryin' pans, and sometimes we had a bird stew, wid all de birds\r\nwe wanted. De stew wus de bes' o' all. Dere aint no sich stews now. We\r\nput flour in de stew. It was made into pastry first, and we called it\r\nslick. When we cooked chicken wid it we called it chicken slick.\r\n\r\nDere were no overseers on our plantation. Marster wouldn't let you have\r\nany money on Sunday. He would not trade on Sunday. He would not handle\r\nmoney matters on Monday, but 'ceptin' dese two days if you went to him\r\nhe would keep you. He was who a good ole man. Dat's de truf.\r\n\r\nThe Ku Klux would certainly work on you. If dey caught you out of your\r\nplace dey would git wid you. I don't remember anything 'bout de\r\nFreedman's Bureau but de Ku Klux Klan was something all niggers wus\r\nscared of. Yes sir, dey would get wid you. Dats right. Ha! Ha! Dat's\r\nright.\r\n\r\nI never seen a slave whupped, no sir, I never see a slave sold. I saw\r\nde speculators do'. I saw de patterollers, but dey didn't never whup my\r\ndaddy. Dey run him one time, but dey couldn't cotch him. Marster Crowder\r\nallus give daddy a pass when he asked fer it.\r\n\r\nI believe ole marster an' ole missus went right on ter Heaven, Yes, I\r\ndo believe dat. Dat's de truf. Yes, my Lawd, I would like to see' em\r\nright now. Dere is only one o' de old crowd livin', an' dat is Miss\r\nCora. She stays right here in Raleigh.\r\n\r\nWe used to have candy pullin's, an' I et more ash cakes den anybody. We\r\ncooked ash cakes out o' meal. We had dances in de winter time, and other\r\nplays. I played marbles an' runnin' an' jumpin' when I wus a chile. Dey\r\ngive us sasafrac tea sweetened to eat wid bread. It shore wus mighty\r\ngood. My father never married enny more. He settled right down after de\r\nwar and farmed fer his old marster and all we chillun stayed. We didn't\r\nwant ter leave, an' I would be wid 'em right now if dey wus livin'.\r\n\r\nI got married when I wus 21 years old, and moved ter myself in a little\r\nhouse on de plantation. De house is standin' dere now, de house where I\r\nlived den. I seed it de udder day when I went out dere to clean off my\r\nwife's grave. I married Lula Hatcher. She died 'bout ten years ago. I\r\nmarried her in Georgia. I stayed dere a long time when missus' brother,\r\nWiley Clemmons, went ter Georgia ter run turpentine an' tuck me wid him.\r\nI stayed dere till he died; an' Mr. Tom Crowder went after him an'\r\nbrought him back home an' buried him at de ole home place. He is buried\r\nright dere at de Crowder place.\r\n\r\nI have worked wid some o' de Crowders mos' all my life and I miss dem\r\npeople, when one of 'em dies. Dey allus give my daddy outside patches,\r\nand he made good on it. He cleaned up seven acres, and do you know how\r\nhe fenced it? Wid nuthin' but bresh. An' hogs an' cows didn't go in dere\r\nneither. We had lots o' game ter eat. Marster 'lowed my daddy ter hunt\r\nwid a gun, and he killed a lot o' rabbits, squirrels, an' game. We\r\ntrapped birds an' caught rabbits in boxes. Daddy caught possums an'\r\ncoons wid dogs. One o' my brothers is livin' at Garner, N. C. I am four\r\nyears older den he is. From what little judgment I got I thought a right\r\nsmart o' Abraham Lincoln, but I tells you de truf Mr. Roosevelt has done\r\na lot o' good. Dats de truf.

Father belonged to the Cottons; Wright Cotton wus his marster.\r\nMy maiden name wus Cotton. Mother and father said they were treated all\r\nright and that they loved their white folks. They gave them patches,\r\nclothed them tolerably well, and seed that they got plenty to eat. The\r\nhours of work wus long. Nearbout everybody worked long hours then, but\r\nthey said they wus not mistreated 'bout nothing. When they got sick\r\nmarster got a doctor, if they wus bad off sick.\r\n\r\nThey wus allowed holidays Christmas and at lay-by time, an' they wus\r\n'lowed to hunt possums an' coons at night an' ketch rabbits in gums.\r\nThey also caught birds in traps made of splinters split from pine wood.\r\n\r\nMother and father had no learnin'. They would not allow them to learn\r\nto read and write. Marster wus keerful 'bout that. I cannot read an'\r\nwrite. My mother and father told me many stories 'bout the patterollers\r\nand Ku Klux. A nigger better have a pass when he went visitin' or if\r\nthey caught him they tore up his back. The Ku Klux made the niggers\r\nthink they could drink a well full of water. They carried rubber things\r\nunder their clothes and a rubber pipe leadin' to a bucket o' water. The\r\nwater bag helt the water they did not drink it. Guess you have heard\r\npeople tell 'bout they drinking so much water.\r\n\r\nMarster didn't have no overseers to look after his slaves. He done that\r\nhisself with the help o' some o' his men slaves. Sometimes he made 'em\r\nforeman and my mother and father said they all got along mighty fine.\r\nThe colored folks went to the white folk's church and had prayer meeting\r\nin their homes.\r\n\r\nMother lived in the edge o' marster's yard. When the surrender come\r\nafter the war they stayed on the plantation right on and lived on\r\nmarster's land. They built log houses after de war cause marster let all\r\nhis slaves stay right on his plantation. My mother had twenty-one\r\nchillun. She had twins five times. I was a twin and Emaline wus my\r\nsister. She died 'bout thirty years ago. She left 11 chillun when she\r\ndied. I never had but four chillun. All my people are dead, I is de only\r\none left.\r\n\r\nMarster's plantation was 'bout six miles from Merry Oaks in Chatham\r\nCounty. We moved to Merry Oaks when I wus fourteen years old. I married\r\nat seventeen. I have lived in North Carolina all my life. We moved to\r\nRaleigh from Merry Oaks long time ago. My husband died here seventeen\r\nyears ago. I worked after my husband died, washin' and ironin' for\r\nwhite folks till I am not able to work no more. Hain't worked any in fo'\r\nyears. Charity don't help me none. My chillun gives me what I gits.\r\n\r\nSlavery wus a bad thing, cause from what mother and father tole me all\r\nslaves didn't fare alike. Some fared good an' some bad. I don't know\r\nenough 'bout Abraham Lincoln an' Mr. Roosevelt to talk about 'em. No, I\r\ndon't know just what to say.

All what ain't\r\nbeen mean could go, but de mean ones can't, an' de rest o' us has ter\r\nhabe a pass ter keep de patterollers from gittin us.\r\n\r\nYes mam, we had our fun at de dances, co'n chuckin's, candy pullin's,\r\nan' de gatherin's an' we sarbed de marster better by habin' our fun.\r\n\r\nI'se seed a bunch o' slaves sold a heap of times an' I neber seed no\r\nchains on nobody. Dey jist stood dem on de table front of de post office\r\nat Cross Roads an' sol' 'em ter de one what bids de highes'.\r\n\r\nWe hyard a whisper 'bout some slaves bein' beat ter death, but I ain't\r\nneber seed a slave git a lick of no kin', course atter de war I seed de\r\nKu Klux runnin' mean niggers.\r\n\r\nDar wus no marryin' on de plantation, iffen a nigger wants a 'oman he\r\nhas got ter buy her or git her marster's permit, den dey am married.\r\n\r\nWhen one o' de slaves wus sick he had a doctor fast as lightnin', an'\r\nwhen de died he wus set up wid one night. De marster would gibe de\r\nmourners a drink o' wine mebbe, an' dey'd mo'n, an' shout, an' sing all\r\nde night long, while de cop'se laid out on de coolin' board, which\r\n'minds me of a tale.\r\n\r\nOnct we wus settin' up wid a nigger, 'fore de war an' hit bein' a hot\r\nnight de wine wus drunk an' de mo'ners wus settin' front o' de do'\r\neatin' watermillons while de daid man laid on de coolin' board. Suddenly\r\none of de niggers looks back in at de do', an' de daid man am settin' up\r\non de coolin' board lookin right at him. De man what sees hit hollers,\r\nan' all de rest what has been wishin 'dat de daid man can enjoy de wine\r\nan' de watermillons am sorry dat he has comed back.\r\n\r\nDey doan take time ter say hit do', case dey am gone ter de big house.\r\nDe marster am brave so he comes ter see, an' he says dat hit am only\r\nrestrictions o' de muscles.\r\n\r\nDe nex' mornin', as am de way, dey puts de man in a pine box made by\r\n'nother slave an' dey totes him from de cabin ter de marster's buryin'\r\ngroun' at de cedars; an' de slaves bury's him while de marster an' his\r\nfambly looks on.\r\n\r\nI doan know much 'bout de Yankees case de warn't none 'cept de skirtin'\r\nparties comed our way.\r\n\r\nAtter de war we stays on fer four or five years mebbe, an' I goes ter\r\nschool two weeks. De teacher wus Mr. Edmund Knights from de No'th.\r\n\r\nI'se sarbed four years an' ten months of a eight ter twelve stretch fer\r\nkillin' a man. Dis man an' a whole gang o' us wus at his house gamblin'.\r\nI had done quit drinkin' er mont' er so 'fore dat, but dey 'sists on\r\nhit, but I 'fuses. Atter 'while he pours some on me an' I cusses him,\r\nden he cusses me, an' he says dat he am gwine ter kill me, an' he\r\nfollers me down de road. I turns roun' an' shoots him.\r\n\r\nDat am all of my story 'cept dat I has seen a powerful heap of ghostes\r\nan' I knows dat dey comes in white an' black, an' dat dey am in de shape\r\ner dogs, mens, an' eber'thing dat you can have a mind to.\r\n\r\nLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

Dey ain't had no slaves 'cept\r\nseben or eight, in fact, dey wuz pore white trash tryin' ter git rich;\r\nso dey make us wuck.\r\n\r\nDey wucks us from daylight till dark, an' sometimes we jist gits one\r\nmeal a day. De marster says dat empty niggers am good niggers an' dat\r\nfull niggers has got de debil in dem. An' we ain't 'lowed ter go nowhar\r\nat night, dat is if dey knowed it. I'se seed de time dat niggers from\r\nall ober de neighborhood gang up an' have fun anyhow, but if dey hyard\r\nde patterollers comin' gallopin' on a hoss dey'd fly. Crap shootin' wuz\r\nde style den, but a heap of times dey can't find nothin ter bet.\r\n\r\nI toted water, case dat's all I wuz big enough ter do, an' lemmie tell\r\nyo' dat when de war wuz ober I ain't had nary a sprig of hair on my\r\nhaid, case de wooden buckets what I toted on it wored it plumb off.\r\n\r\nWhen we got hongry an' could fin' a pig, a calf or a chicken, no matter\r\nwho it had belonged to, it den belonged ter us. We raised a heap o' cane\r\nan' we et brown sugar. Hit 's funny dat de little bit dey gibed us wuz\r\nwhat dey now calls wholesome food, an' hit shore make big husky\r\nniggers.\r\n\r\nMy mammy had more grit dan any gal I now knows of has in her craw. She\r\nplowed a hateful little donkey dat wuz about as hongry as she wuz, an'\r\nhe wuz a cuss if'en dar eber wuz one. Mammy wuz a little brown gal, den,\r\ntough as nails an' she ain't axin' dat donkey no odds at all. She uster\r\ntake him out at twelve an' start fer de house an' dat donkey would hunch\r\nup his back an' swear dat she wuzn't gwine ter ride him home.

Seberal of de chilluns had been sold 'fore de\r\nspeculator come an' buyed mammy, pappy an' we three chilluns. De\r\nspeculator wus named Bebus an' he lived in Henderson, but he meant to\r\nsell us in de tobacco country.\r\n\r\nWe come through Raleigh an' de fust thing dat I 'members good wus goin'\r\nthrough de paper mill on Crabtree. We traveled on ter Granville County\r\non de Granville Tobacco path till a preacher named Whitfield buyed us.\r\nHe lived near de Granville an' Franklin County line, on de Granville\r\nside.\r\n\r\nPreacher Whitfield, bein' a preacher, wus supposed to be good, but he\r\nain't half fed ner clothed his slaves an' he whupped 'em bad. I'se seen\r\nhim whup my mammy wid all de clothes offen her back. He'd buck her down\r\non a barrel an' beat de blood outen her. Dar wus some difference in his\r\nbeatin' from de neighbors. De folks round dar 'ud whup in de back yard,\r\nbut Marse Whitfield 'ud have de barrel carried in his parlor fer de\r\nbeatin'.\r\n\r\nWe ain't had no sociables, but we went to church on Sunday an' dey\r\npreached to us dat we'd go ter hell alive iffen we sassed our white\r\nfolks.\r\n\r\nSpeakin' 'bout clothes, I went as naked as Yo' han' till I wus fourteen\r\nyears old. I wus naked like dat when my nature come to me. Marse\r\nWhitfield ain't carin', but atter dat mammy tol' him dat I had ter have\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nMarse Whitfield ain't never pay fer us so finally we wus sold to Mis'\r\nFanny Long in Franklin County. Dat 'oman wus a debil iffen dar eber wus\r\none. When I wus little I had picked up de fruit, fanned flies offen de\r\ntable wid a peafowl fan an' nussed de little slave chilluns. De las' two\r\nor three years I had worked in de fiel' but at Mis' Long's I worked in\r\nde backer factory.\r\n\r\nYes mam, she had a backer factory whar backer wus stemmed, rolled an'\r\npacked in cases fer sellin'. Dey said dat she had got rich on sellin'\r\nchawin' terbacker.\r\n\r\nWe wus at Mis' Long's when war wus declared, 'fore dat she had been\r\npurty good, but she am a debil now. Her son am called ter de war an' he\r\nwon't go. Dey comes an' arrests him, den his mammy tries ter pay him\r\nout, but dat ain't no good.\r\n\r\nDe officers sez dat he am yaller an' dat day am gwine ter shoot his\r\nhead off an' use hit fer a soap gourd. De Yankees did shoot him down\r\nhere at Bentonville an' Mis' Long went atter de body. De Confederates\r\nhas got de body but dey won't let her have it fer love ner money. Dey\r\nlaughs an' tells her how yaller he am an' dey buries him in a ditch like\r\na dog.\r\n\r\nMis' Long has been bad enough fore den but atter her son is dead she\r\nsez dat she am gwine ter fight till she draps dead. De nex' day she\r\nsticks de shot gun in mammy's back an' sez dat she am gwine ter shoot\r\nher dead. Mammy smiles an' tells her dat she am ready ter go. Mis' Long\r\nturns on me an' tells me ter go ter de peach tree an' cut her ten limbs\r\n'bout a yard long, dis I does an' atter she ties dem in a bundle she\r\nwears dem out on me at a hundret licks. Lemmie tell yo', dar wus pieces\r\nof de peach tree switches stickin' all in my bloody back when she got\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nAtter dat Mis' Long ain't done nothin' but whup us an' fight till she\r\nshore nuff wore out.\r\n\r\nDe Yankee captain come ter our place an tol' us dat de lan' was goin'\r\nter be cut up an' divided among de slaves, dey would also have a mule\r\nan' a house apiece.\r\n\r\nI doan know how come hit but jist 'fore de end of de war we come ter\r\nMoses Mordicia's place, right up de hill from here. He wus mean too,\r\nhe'd get drunk an' whup niggers all day off' an' on. He'd keep dem tied\r\ndown dat long too, sometimes from sunrise till dark.\r\n\r\nMr. Mordicia had his yaller gals in one quarter ter dereselves an' dese\r\ngals belongs ter de Mordicia men, dere friends an' de overseers. When a\r\nbaby wus born in dat quarter dey'd sen' hit over ter de black quarter\r\nat birth. Dey do say dat some of dese gal babies got grown an' atter\r\ngoin' back ter de yaller quarter had more chilluns fer her own daddy or\r\nbrother. De Thompson's sprung from dat set an' dey say dat a heap of dem\r\nis halfwits fer de reason dat I has jist tol' yo'. Dem yaller wimen wus\r\nhighfalutin' too, dey though [HW correction: thought] dey wus better dan\r\nde black ones.\r\n\r\nHas yo' ever wondered why de yaller wimen dese days am meaner dan black\r\nones 'bout de men? Well dat's de reason fer hit, dere mammies raised dem\r\nto think 'bout de white men.\r\n\r\nWhen de Yankees come dey come an' freed us. De woods wus full of Rebs\r\nwhat had deserted, but de Yankees killed some of dem.\r\n\r\nSome sort of corporation cut de land up, but de slaves ain't got none\r\nof it dat I ever heard about.\r\n\r\nI got married before de war to Joshua Curtis. I loved him too, which is\r\nmore dam most folks can truthfully say. I always had craved a home an' a\r\nplenty to eat, but freedom ain't give us notin' but pickled hoss meat\r\nan' dirty crackers, an' not half enough of dat.\r\n\r\nJosh ain't really care 'bout no home but through dis land corporation I\r\nbuyed dese fifteen acres on time. I cut down de big trees dat wus all\r\nover dese fields an' I milled out de wood an' sold hit, den I plowed up\r\nde fields an' planted dem. Josh did help to build de house an' he worked\r\nout some.\r\n\r\nAll of dis time I had nineteen chilluns an' Josh died, but I kep' on\r\nan' de fifteen what is dead lived to be near 'bout grown, ever one of\r\ndem.\r\n\r\nRight atter de war northern preachers come around wid a little book\r\na-marrying slaves an' I seed one of dem marry my pappy an' mammy. Atter\r\ndis dey tried to find dere fourteen oldest chilluns what wus sold away,\r\nbut dey never did find but three of dem.\r\n\r\nBut you wants ter find out how I got along. I'll never fergit my first\r\nbale of cotton an' how I got hit sold. I wus some proud of dat bale of\r\ncotton, an' atter I had hit ginned I set out wid hit on my steercart fer\r\nRaleigh. De white folks hated de nigger den, 'specially de nigger what\r\nwus makin' somethin' so I dasen't ax nobody whar de market wus.\r\n\r\nI thought dat I could find de place by myself, but I rid all day an'\r\nhad to take my cotton home wid me dat night 'case I can't find no place\r\nto sell hit at. But dat night I think hit over an' de nex' day I goes'\r\nback an' axes a policeman 'bout de market. Lo an' behold chile, I foun'\r\nhit on Blount Street, an' I had pass by hit seberal times de day\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nI done a heap of work at night too, all of my sewin' an' such an' de\r\npiece of lan' near de house over dar ain't never got no work 'cept at\r\nnight. I finally paid fer de land. Some of my chilluns wus borned in de\r\nfield too. When I wus to de house we had a granny an' I blowed in a\r\nbottle to make de labor quick an' easy.\r\n\r\nDis young generation ain't worth shucks. Fifteen years ago I hired a\r\nbig buck nigger to help me shrub an' 'fore leben o'clock he passed out\r\non me. You know 'bout leben o'clock in July hit gits in a bloom. De\r\nyoung generation wid dere schools an dere divorcing ain't gwine ter git\r\nnothin' out of life. Hit wus better when folks jist lived tergether.\r\nDere loafin' gits dem inter trouble an' dere novels makes dem bad\r\nhusban's an' wives too.\r\n\r\nEH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Miss Nancy Woodburn Watkins          [320227]\r\nRockingham County\r\nMadison, North Carolina\r\n\r\n[TR: No. Words: 1,165]\r\n\r\nEx-Slave Biography--Charles Lee Dalton, 93.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July, 1934, the census taker went to the home of Unka Challilee\r\nDalton and found that soft talking old darky on the porch of his several\r\nroomed house, a few hundred feet south of the dirt road locally called\r\nthe Ayersville road because it branches from the hard surfaced highway\r\nto Mayodan at Anderson Scales' store, a short distance from Unka\r\nChallilie's.

But young Miss'ud read de Bible to us sometimes.\r\n\r\nHere in the five room, white painted cottage of his son, Frank, Unka\r\nChallilie is kindly cared for by his daughter-in-law, Mattie. A front\r\nporch faces the Mayodan hard road a few doors from the \"coppubration\r\nline.\" A well made arch accents the entrance to the front walk. A\r\nclimbing rose flourishes on the arch. Well kept grass with flowers on\r\nthe edges show Mattie's love. At the right side is the vegetable garden,\r\ninvaded by several big domineckuh chickens. A kudzu vine keeps out the\r\nhot west sun. Unka Challilie sits on the front porch and nods to his\r\nfriends [HW: , or] else back in the kitchen, he sits and watches Mattie\r\niron after he has eaten his breakfast. Several hens come on the back\r\nporch and lay in boxes there. One is \"uh settin\" fuh fried chicken\r\nlater! A walnut tree, \"uh white wawnut\", waves its long dangly green\r\nblooms as the leaves are half grown in the early May. Well dressed,\r\nclean, polite, comforted with his religion, but very \"trimbly\" even on\r\nhis stout walking stick, Unka Challilie often dozes away his \"no\r\ncountness\" with \"uh napuh sleepin\" while the mad rush of traffic and\r\ntourist wheels stir the rose climbing over the entrance arch. An\r\nex-slave who started wiff nuffin de Yankees gave him, who lived on his\r\nold Marse's place ontil he wuz forty-eight, who cleaned the Mayo Mills\r\nontill he wuz too trimbly to get amongst de machinery, who raised eleven\r\nchildren on an acre of red Rockingham county hillside, faces the next\r\nmove with plenty to eat, wear, plenty time to take a nap uh sleepin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

Cabarrus Street\r\n\r\n\r\nMy full name is Harriet Ann Daves, I like to be called Harriet Ann. If\r\nmy mother called me when she was living, I didn't want to answer her\r\nunless she called me Harriet Ann. I was born June 6, 1856. Milton\r\nWaddell, my mother's marster was my father, and he never denied me to\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\nMy mother was a slave but she was white. I do not know who my mother's\r\nfather was. My mother was Mary Collins. She said that her father was an\r\nIndian. My mother's mother was Mary Jane Collins, and she was\r\nwhite--maybe part Indian. My grandfather was old man William D. Waddell,\r\na white man. I was born in Virginia near Orange Courthouse. The Waddells\r\nmoved to Lexington, Missouri, after I was born. I guess some of the\r\nfamily would not like it if they knew I was telling this. We had good\r\nfood and a nice place to live. I was nothing but a child, but I know,\r\nand remember that I was treated kindly. I remember the surrender very\r\nwell. When the surrender came my grandfather came to mother and told\r\nher: 'Well, you are as free as I am.' That was William D. Waddell. He\r\nwas one of the big shots among the white folks.\r\n\r\nMy white grandmother wanted mother to give me to her entirely. She said\r\nshe had more right to me than my Indian grandmother that she had plenty\r\nto educate and care for me. My mother would not give me to her, and she\r\ncried. My mother gave me to my Indian grandmother. I later went back to\r\nmy mother.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in Missouri some of my father's people, a white girl,\r\nsent for me to come up to the great house. I had long curls and was\r\nconsidered pretty. The girl remarked, 'Such a pretty child' and kissed\r\nme. She afterwards made a remark to which my father who was there, my\r\nwhite father, took exception telling her I was his child and that I was\r\nas good as she was. I remember this incident very distinctly.\r\n\r\nMy mother had two children by the same white man, my father. The other\r\nwas a girl. She died in California. My father never married. He loved my\r\nmother, and he said if he could not marry Mary he did not want to marry.\r\nFather said he did not want any other woman. My father was good to me.\r\nHe would give me anything I asked him for. Mother would make me ask him\r\nfor things for her. She said it was no harm for me to ask him for things\r\nfor her which she could not get unless I asked him for them. When the\r\nsurrender came my mother told my father she was tired of living that\r\nkind of a life, that if she could not be his legal wife she wouldn't be\r\nanything to him, so she left and went to Levenworth, Kansas. She died\r\nthere in 1935. I do not know where my father is, living or dead, or what\r\nbecame of him.\r\n\r\nI can read and write well. They did not teach us to read and write in\r\nslavery days. I went to a school opened by the Yankees after the\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nI went with my mother to Levenworth, Kansas. She sent me to school in\r\nFlat, Nebraska. I met my husband there. My first husband was Elisha\r\nWilliams; I ran away from school in Flat, and married him. He brought me\r\nto Raleigh. He was born and raised in Wake County. We lived together\r\nabout a year when he died July 1st, 1872. There was one child born to us\r\nwhich died in infancy.\r\n\r\nI married the second time Rufus H. Daves in 1875. He was practically a\r\nwhite man. He wouldn't even pass for a mulatto. He used to belong to the\r\nHaywoods. He died in 1931 in Raleigh.\r\n\r\nI think Abraham Lincoln was a fine, conscientious man; my mother\r\nworshipped him, but he turned us out without anything to eat or live on.\r\nI don't think Mr. Roosevelt is either hot or cold--just a normal man.\r\n\r\nAC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

I don't know very much\r\nabout those times, I was so young, but I remember the Yankees all right\r\nin their blue clothes; their horses, and so on. I'll be 78 years old the\r\n8th of this comin' September an' I've heard mother an' father talk about\r\nslavery time a whole lot. We belonged to T. R. Debnam at Eagle Rock, Wake\r\nCounty. His wife was named Priscilla Debnam. My father was named Daniel\r\nDebnam an' my mother was named Liza Debnam. My master had several\r\nplantations an' a lot of slaves. I don't know how many, but I know he\r\nhad 'em. He fed us well; we had a good place to sleep. We had wove\r\nclothes, enough to keep us warm. He treated me just like he had been my\r\nfather. I didn't know the difference. Marster an' missus never hit me a\r\nlick in their lives. My mother was the house girl. Father tended\r\nbusiness around the house an' worked in the field sometimes. Our houses\r\nwere in marster's yard. The slave quarters were in the yard of the great\r\nhouse. I don't remember going to church until after the surrender.\r\n\r\nI remember the corn shuckin's, but not the Christmas and the fourth of\r\nJuly holidays. They had a lot of whiskey at corn shuckin's and good\r\nthings to eat.\r\n\r\nI heard pappy talk of patterollers, but I do not know what they were.\r\nPappy said he had to have a pass to visit on, or they would whip him if\r\nthey could ketch him. Sometimes they could not ketch a nigger they were\r\nafter. Yes, they taught us to say pappy an' mammy in them days.\r\n\r\nI remember the coon and possum hunts an' the rabbits we caught in gums.\r\nI remember killin' birds at night with thorn brush. When bird blindin'\r\nwe hunt 'em at night with lights from big splinters. We went to grass\r\npatches, briars, and vines along the creeks an' low groun's where they\r\nroosted, an' blinded 'em an' killed 'em when they come out. We cooked\r\n'em on coals, and I remember making a stew and having dumplings cooked\r\nwith 'em. We'd flustrate the birds in their roostin' place an' when they\r\ncome out blinded by the light we hit 'em an' killed 'em with thorn brush\r\nwe carried in our han's.\r\n\r\nMarster had a gran'son, the son of Alonza Hodge an' Arabella Hodge,\r\n'bout my age an' I stayed with him most of the time. When Alonza Hodge\r\nbought his son anything he bought for me too. He treated us alike. He\r\nbought each of us a pony. We could ride good, when we were small. He let\r\nus follow him. He let us go huntin' squirrels with him. When he shot an'\r\nkilled a squirrel he let us race to see which could get him first, while\r\nhe laughed at us.\r\n\r\nI didn't sleep in the great house. I stayed with this white boy till\r\nbed time then my mammy come an' got me an' carried me home. When marster\r\nwanted us boys to go with him he would say, 'Let's go boys,' an' we\r\nwould follow him. We were like brothers. I ate with him at the table.\r\nWhat they et, I et. He made the house girl wait on me just like he an'\r\nhis son was waited on.\r\n\r\nMy father stayed with marster till he died, when he was 63 an' I was\r\n21; we both stayed right there. My white playmate's name was Richard\r\nHodge. I stayed there till I was married. When I got 25 years old I\r\nmarried Ida Rawlson. Richard Hodge became a medical doctor, but he died\r\nyoung, just before I was married.\r\n\r\nThey taught me to read an' write. After the surrender I went to free\r\nschool. When I didn't know a word I went to old marster an' he told me.\r\n\r\nDuring my entire life no man can touch my morals, I was brought up by\r\nmy white folks not to lie, steal or do things immoral. I have lived a\r\npure life. There is nothing against me.\r\n\r\nI remember the Yankees, yes sir, an' somethings they done. Well, I\r\nremember the big yeller gobler they couldn't ketch. He riz an' flew an'\r\nthey shot him an' killed him. They went down to marster's store an'\r\nbusted the head outen a barrel o' molasses an' after they busted the\r\nhead out I got a tin bucket an' got it full o' molasses an' started to\r\nthe house. Then they shoved me down in the molasses. I set the bucket\r\ndown an' hit a Yankee on the leg with a dogwood stick. He tried to hit\r\nme. The Yankees ganged around him, an' made him leave me alone, give me\r\nmy bucket o' molasses, an' I carried it on to the house. They went down\r\nto the lot, turned out all the horses an' tuck two o' the big mules,\r\nKentucky mules, an' carried 'em off. One of the mules would gnaw every\r\nline in two you tied him with, an' the other could not be rode. So next\r\nmorning after the Yankees carried 'em off they both come back home with\r\npieces o' lines on 'em. The mules was named, one was named Bill, an' the\r\nother Charles. You could ride old Charles, but you couldn't ride old\r\nBill. He would throw you off as fast as you got on 'im.\r\n\r\nAfter I was married when I was 25 years old I lived there ten years,\r\nright there; but old marster had died an' missus had died. I stayed with\r\nhis son Nathaniel; his wife was named Drusilla.\r\n\r\nI had five brothers, Richard, Daniel, Rogene, Lorenzo, Lumus and\r\nmyself. There wont places there for us all, an' then I left. When I left\r\ndown there I moved to Raleigh. The first man I worked fer here was\r\nGeorge Marsh Company, then W. A. Myatt Company an' no one else. I worked\r\nwith the Myatt Company twenty-six years; 'till I got shot.\r\n\r\nIt was about half past twelve o'clock. I was on my way home to dinner\r\non the 20th of December, 1935. When I was passing Patterson's Alley\r\nentering Lenoir Street near the colored park in the 500 block something\r\nhit me. I looked around an' heard a shot. The bullet hit me before I\r\nheard the report of the pistol. When hit, I looked back an' heard it.\r\nCapt. Bruce Pool, o' the Raleigh Police force, had shot at some thief\r\nthat had broken into a A&P Store an' the bullet hit me. It hit me in my\r\nleft thigh above the knee. It went through my thigh, a 38 caliber\r\nbullet, an' lodged under the skin on the other side. I did not fall but\r\nstood on one foot while the blood ran from the wound. A car came by in\r\nabout a half hour an' they stopped an' carried me to St. Agnes Hospital.\r\nIt was not a police car. I stayed there a week. They removed the bullet,\r\nan' then I had to go to the hospital every day for a month. I have not\r\nbeen able to work a day since. I was working with W. A. Myatt Company\r\nwhen I got shot. My leg pains me now and swells up. I cannot stand on it\r\nmuch. I am unable to do a day's work. Can't stand up to do a day's work.\r\nThe city paid me $200.00, an' paid my hospital bill.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln was all right. I think slavery was wrong because birds\r\nan' things are free an' man ought to have the same privilege.\r\n\r\nFranklin Roosevelt is a wonderful man. Men would have starved if he\r\nhadn't helped 'em.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

Marse\r\nCain's plantation joined Mistah Paul Cameron's land. Marse Cain owned so\r\nmany niggers dat he didn' know his own slaves when he met dem in de\r\nroad. Sometimes he would stop dem an' say: 'Whose niggers am you?' Dey'd\r\nsay, 'We's Marse Cain's niggers.' Den he would say, 'I'se Marse Cain,'\r\nand drive on.\r\n\r\nMarse Cain was good to his niggers. He didn' whip dem like some owners\r\ndid, but if dey done mean he sold dem. Dey knew dis so dey minded him.\r\nOne day gran'pappy sassed Mis' Polly White an' she told him dat if he\r\ndidn' 'have hese'f dat she would put him in her pocket. Gran'pappy wuz\r\ner big man an' I ax him how Mis' Polly could do dat. He said she meant\r\ndat she would sell him den put de money in her pocket. He never did sass\r\nMis' Polly no more.\r\n\r\nI was kept at de big house to wait on Mis' Polly, to tote her basket of\r\nkeys an' such as dat. Whenever she seed a chile down in de quarters dat\r\nshe wanted to raise be hand, she took dem up to do big house an' trained\r\ndem. I wuz to be a house maid. De day she took me my mammy cried kaze\r\nshe knew I would never be 'lowed to live at de cabin wid her no more\r\nMis' Polly was big an' fat an' she made us niggers mind an' we had to\r\nkeep clean. My dresses an' aprons was starched stiff. I had a clean\r\napron every day. We had white sheets on de beds an' we niggers had\r\nplenty to eat too, even ham. When Mis' Polly went to ride she took me in\r\nde carriage wid her. De driver set way up high an' me an' Mis' Polly set\r\nway down low. Dey was two hosses with shiney harness. I toted Mis'\r\nPolly's bag an' bundles, an' if she dropped her hank'chief I picked it\r\nup. I loved Mis' Polly an' loved stayin' at de big house.\r\n\r\nI was 'bout wais' high when de sojers mustered. I went wid Mis' Polly\r\ndown to de musterin' fiel' whare dey was marchin'. I can see dey feets\r\nnow when dey flung dem up an' down, sayin', hep, hep. When dey was all\r\nready to go an' fight, de women folks fixed a big dinner. Aunt Charity\r\nan' Pete cooked two or three days for Mis' Polly. De table was piled wid\r\nchicken, ham, shoat, barbecue, young lam', an'all sorts of pies, cakes\r\nan' things, but nobody eat nothin much. Mis' Polly an' de ladies got to\r\ncryin.' De vittles got cold. I was so sad dat I got over in de corner\r\nan' cried too. De men folks all had on dey new sojer clothes, an' dey\r\ndidn' eat nothin neither. Young Marse Jim went up an' put his arm 'roun'\r\nMis' Polly, his mammy, but dat made her cry harder. Marse Jim was a\r\ncavalry. He rode a big hoss, an' my Uncle Dave went wid him to de fiel'\r\nas his body guard. He had a hoss too so if Marse Jim's hoss got shot\r\ndare would be another one for him to ride. Mis' Polly had another son\r\nbut he was too drunk to hold a gun. He stayed drunk.\r\n\r\nDe first cannon I heard skeered me near 'bout to death. We could hear\r\ndem goin' boom, boom. I thought it was thunder, den Mis Polly say,\r\n'Lissen, Sarah, hear dem cannons? Dey's killin' our mens.' Den she 'gun\r\nto cry.\r\n\r\nI run in de kitchen whare Aunt Charity was cookin an' tole her Mis'\r\nPolly was cryin. She said: 'She ain't cryin' kaze de Yankees killin' de\r\nmens; she's doin' all dat cryin' kaze she skeered we's goin' to be sot\r\nfree.' Den I got mad an' tole her Mis' Polly wuzn' like dat.\r\n\r\nI 'members when Wheelers Cavalry come through. Dey was 'Federates but\r\ndey was mean as de Yankees. Dey stold everything dey could find an'\r\nkilled a pile of niggers. Dey come 'roun' checkin'. Dey ax de niggahs if\r\ndey wanted to be free. If dey say yes, den dey shot dem down, but if dey\r\nsay no, dey let dem alone. Dey took three of my uncles out in de woods\r\nan' shot dey faces off.\r\n\r\nI 'members de first time de Yankees come. Dey come gallupin' down de\r\nroad, jumpin' over de palin's, tromplin' down de rose bushes an' messin'\r\nup de flower beds. Dey stomped all over de house, in de kitchen,\r\npantries, smoke house, an' everywhare, but dey didn' find much, kaze\r\nnear 'bout everything done been hid. I was settin' on de steps when a\r\nbig Yankee come up. He had on a cap an' his eyes was mean.\r\n\r\n'Whare did dey hide do gol' an silver, Nigger?' he yelled at me.\r\n\r\nI was skeered an my hands was ashy, but I tole him I didn' nothin' 'bout\r\nnothin; dat if anybody done hid things dey hid it while I was sleep.\r\n\r\n'Go ax dat ole white headed devil,' he said to me.\r\n\r\nI got mad den kaze he was tawkin' 'bout Mis' Polly, so I didn' say\r\nnothin'. I jus' set. Den he pushed me off de step an' say if I didn'\r\ndance he gwine shoot my toes off. Skeered as I was, I sho done some\r\nshufflin'. Den he give me five dollers an' tole me to go buy jim cracks,\r\nbut dat piece of paper won't no good. 'Twuzn nothin' but a shin plaster\r\nlike all dat war money, you couldn' spend it.\r\n\r\nDat Yankee kept callin' Mis' Polly a white headed devil an' said she\r\ndone ramshacked 'til dey wuzn' nothin' left, but he made his mens tote\r\noff meat, flour, pigs, an' chickens. After dat Mis' Polly got mighty\r\nstingy wid de vittles an' de didn' have no more ham.\r\n\r\nWhen de war was over de Yankees was all 'roun' de place tellin' de\r\nniggers what to do. Dey tole dem dey was free, dat dey didn' have to\r\nslave for de white folks no more. My folks all left Marse Cain an' went\r\nto live in houses dat de Yankees built. Dey wuz like poor white folks\r\nhouses, little shacks made out of sticks an' mud wid stick an' mud\r\nchimneys. Dey wuzn' like Marse Cain's cabins, planked up an' warm, dey\r\nwas full of cracks, an' dey wuzn' no lamps an' oil. All de light come\r\nfrom de lightwood knots burnin' in de fireplace.\r\n\r\nOne day my mammy come to de big house after me. I didn' want to go, I\r\nwanted to stay wid Mis' Polly. I 'gun to cry an' Mammy caught hold of\r\nme. I grabbed Mis' Polly an' held so tight dat I tore her skirt bindin'\r\nloose an' her skirt fell down 'bout her feets.\r\n\r\n'Let her stay wid me,' Mis' Polly said to Mammy.\r\n\r\nBut Mammy shook her head. 'You took her away from me an' didn' pay no\r\nmind to my cryin', so now I'se takin' her back home. We's free now, Mis'\r\nPolly, we ain't gwine be slaves no more to nobody.' She dragged me away.\r\nI can see how Mis' Polly looked now. She didn' say nothin' but she\r\nlooked hard at Mammy an' her face was white.\r\n\r\nMammy took me to de stick an' mud house de Yankees done give her. It was\r\nsmoky an' dark kaze dey wuzn' no windows. We didn' have no sheets an' no\r\ntowels, so when I cried an' said I didn' want to live on no Yankee\r\nhouse, Mammy beat me an' made me go to bed. I laid on de straw tick\r\nlookin' up through de cracks in de roof. I could see de stars, an' de\r\nsky shinin' through de cracks looked like long blue splinters stretched\r\n'cross de rafters. I lay dare an' cried kaze I wanted to go back to Mis'\r\nPolly.\r\n\r\nI was never hungry til we waz free an' de Yankees fed us. We didn' have\r\nnothin to eat 'cept hard tack an' middlin' meat. I never saw such meat.\r\nIt was thin an' tough wid a thick skin. You could boil it allday an' all\r\nnight an' it wouldn' cook dome, I wouldn' eat it. I thought 'twuz mule\r\nmeat; mules dat done been shot on de battle field den dried. I still\r\nbelieve 'twuz mule meat.\r\n\r\nOne day me an' my brother was lookin' for acorns in de woods. We foun'\r\nsumpin' like a grave in de woods. I tole Dave dey wuz sumpin' buried in\r\ndat moun'. We got de grubbin hoe an' dug. Dey wuz a box wid eleven hams\r\nin dat grave. Somebody done hid it from de Yankees an' forgot whare dey\r\nburied it. We covered it back up kaze if we took it home in de day time\r\nde Yankees an' niggers would take it away from us. So when night come we\r\nslipped out an' toted dem hams to de house an' hid dem in de loft.\r\n\r\nDem was bad days. I'd rather been a slave den to been hired out like I\r\nwas, kaze I wuzn' no fiel' hand, I was a hand maid, trained to wait on\r\nde ladies. Den too, I was hungry most of de time an' had to keep\r\nfightin' off dem Yankee mens. Dem Yankees was mean folks.\r\n\r\nWe's come a long way since dem times. I'se lived near 'bout ninety years\r\nan' I'se seen an' heard much. My folks don't want me to talk 'bout\r\nslavery, day's shame niggers ever was slaves. But, while for most\r\ncolored folks freedom is de bes, dey's still some niggers dat out to be\r\nslaves now. Dese niggers dat's done clean forgot de Lawd; dose dat's\r\nalways cuttin' an' fightin' an' gwine in white folks houses at night,\r\ndey ought to be slaves. Dey ought to have an' Ole Marse wid a whip to\r\nmake dem come when he say come, an' go when he say go, 'til dey learn to\r\nlive right.\r\n\r\nI looks back now an' thinks. I ain't never forgot dem slavery days, an'\r\nI ain't never forgot Mis' Polly an' my white starched aprons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District: No. 2                    [320147]\r\nWorker:         T.

Dickens. I lives at 1115 East Lenoir Street,\r\nRaleigh, North Carolina, Wake County. I wuz born August 16, 1861, de\r\nyear de war started. My mother wuz named Ferebee Dickens. My father wuz\r\nnamed John Dickens. I had nine sisters and brothers. My brothers were\r\nnamed Allen, Douglas, my name [HW: question mark above \"my name\"], Jake,\r\nJohnnie and Jonas. The girls Katie, Matilda Francis, and Emily Dickens.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother wuz named Charity Dickens. My grandfather wuz Dudley T.\r\nDickens. I do not know where dey came from. No, I don't think I do. My\r\nmother belonged to Washington Scarborough, and so did we chilluns. My\r\nfather he belonged to Obediah Dickens and missus wuz named Silvia\r\nDickens. Dey lowed mother to go by the name of my father after dey wuz\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nWe lived in log houses and we had bunks in 'em. Master died, but I\r\n'member missus wuz mighty good to us. We had tolerable fair food, and as\r\nfur as I know she wuz good to us in every way. We had good clothing made\r\nin a loom, that is de cloth wuz made in de loom. My father lived in\r\nFranklin County. My mother lived in Wake County. I 'member hearin'\r\nfather talk about walkin' so fur to see us. There wuz about one dozen\r\nslaves on de plantation. Dere were no hired overseers. Missus done her\r\nown bossing. I have heard my father speak about de patterollers, but I\r\nnever seed none. I heard him say he could not leave the plantation\r\nwithout a strip o' something.\r\n\r\nNo, sir, the white folks did not teach us to read and write. My mother\r\nand father, no sir, they didn't have any books of any kind. We went to\r\nwhite folk's church. My father split slats and made baskets to sell. He\r\nsaid his master let him have all de money he made sellin' de things he\r\nmade. He learned a trade. He wuz a carpenter. One of the young masters\r\ngot after father, so he told me, and he went under de house to keep him\r\nfrom whuppin' him. When missus come home she wouldn't let young master\r\nwhup him. She jist wouldn't 'low it.\r\n\r\nI 'members de Yankees comin' through. When mother heard they were\r\ncomin', she took us chillun and carried us down into an ole field, and\r\nafter that she carried us back to the house. Missus lived in a two-story\r\nhouse. We lived in a little log house in front of missus' house. My\r\nmother had a shoulder of meat and she hid it under a mattress in the\r\nhouse. When the Yankees lef, she looked for it; they had stole the meat\r\nand gone. Yes, they stole from us slaves. The road the Yankees wuz\r\ntravellin' wuz as thick wid' em as your fingers. I 'member their blue\r\nclothes, their blue caps. De chickens they were carrying on their horses\r\nwuz crowing. Dey wuz driving cows, hogs, and things. Yes sir, ahead of\r\n'em they come first. The barns and lots were on one side de road dey\r\nwere trabellin' on and de houses on de other. Atter many Yankees had\r\npassed dey put a bodyguard at de door of de great house, and didn't 'low\r\nno one to go in dere. I looked down at de Yankees and spit at 'em.\r\nMother snatched me back, and said, 'Come back here chile, dey will kill\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\nDey carried de horses off de plantation and de meat from missus'\r\nsmokehouse and buried it. My uncle, Louis Scarborough, stayed wid de\r\nhorses. He is livin' yet, he is over a hundred years old. He lives down\r\nat Moores Mill, Wake County, near Youngsville. Before de surrender one\r\nof de boys and my uncle got to fightin', one of de Scarborough boys and\r\nhim. My uncle threw him down. The young Master Scarborough jumped up,\r\nand got his knife and cut uncle's entrails out so uncle had to carry 'em\r\nto de house in his hands. About a year after de war my father carried us\r\nto Franklin County. He carried us on a steer cart. Dat's about all I\r\n'member about de war.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln wuz de man who set us free. I think he wuz a mighty\r\ngood man. He done so much for de colored race, but what he done was\r\nintended through de higher power. I don't think slavery wuz right.\r\n\r\nI think Mr. Roosevelt is a fine man, one of the best presidents in the\r\nworld. I voted for him, and I would vote for him ag'in. He has done a\r\nlot for de people, and is still doin'. He got a lot of sympathy for 'em.\r\nYas sir, a lot of sympathy for de people.\r\n\r\nMM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

Dickens and I was born on the 5th of June 1861.\r\nMy mother wuz free born; her name wuz Mary Ann Hews, but my mother wuz\r\ncolored. I don't remember anything about Marster and Missus. My father\r\nwas named Henry Byrd. Here is some of father's writing. My mother's\r\nfather was dark. He had no protection. If he did any work for a white\r\nman and the white man didn't like it, he could take him up and whup him.\r\nMy father was like a stray dog.\r\n\r\nMy name was Margaret E. Byrd before I got married. Here is some of\r\nfather's writing--\"Margaret Elvira Byrd the daughter of Henry and Mary\r\nAnn Byrd was born on the 5th June 1861.\" My grandfather, my mother's\r\nfather was a cabinet maker. He made coffins and tables and furniture. If\r\nhe made one, and it didn't suit the man he would beat him and kick him\r\naround and let him go. Dis was told to me. My father was a carpenter. He\r\nbuilt houses.\r\n\r\nI can read and write. My father could read and write. My mother could\r\nread, but couldn't write very much.\r\n\r\nI have heerd my mother say when she heerd the Yankees were commin' she\r\nhad a brand new counterpane, my father owned a place before he married\r\nmy mother, the counterpane was a woolen woven counterpane. She took it\r\noff and hid it. The Yankees took anything they wanted, but failed to\r\nfind it. We were living in Raleigh, at the time, on the very premises we\r\nare living on now. The old house has been torn down, but some of the\r\nwood is in this very house. I kin show you part of the old house now. My\r\nmother used to pass this place when she wuz a girl and she told me she\r\nnever expected to live here. She was twenty years younger than my\r\nfather. My mother, she lived here most of the time except twenty-four\r\nyears she lived in the North. She died in 1916. My father bought the\r\nlan' in 1848 from a man named Henry Morgan. Here is the deed.[6]\r\n\r\nWhen we left Raleigh, and went North we first stopped in Cambridge,\r\nMass. This was with my first husband. His name was Samuel E. Reynolds.\r\nHe was a preacher. He had a church and preached there. The East winds\r\nwere so strong and cold we couldn't stan' it. It was too cold for us. We\r\nthen went to Providence, R. I. From there to Elmira, N. Y. From there we\r\nwent to Brooklyn, N. Y. He preached in the State of New York; we finally\r\ncame back South, and he died right here in this house. I like the North\r\nvery well, but there is nothing like home, the South. Another thing I\r\ndon't have so many white kin folks up North. I don't like to be called\r\nAuntie by anyone, unless they admit bein' kin to me. I was not a fool\r\nwhen I went to the North, and it made no change in me. I was raised to\r\nrespect everybody and I tries to keep it up. Some things in the North\r\nare all right, I like them, but I like the South better. Yes, I guess I\r\nlike the South better. I was married to Charles W. Dickens in 1920. He\r\nis my second husband.\r\n\r\nI inherited this place from my father Henry Byrd. I like well water.\r\nThere is my well, right out here in the yard. This well was dug here\r\nwhen they were building the first house here. I believe in havin' your\r\nown home, so I have held on to my home, and I am goin' to try to keep\r\nholdin' on to it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: An interesting feature of the deed is the fact that\r\nHenry Morgan made his mark while Henry Byrd's signature\r\nis his own.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

C.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Squire Dowd, and I was born April 3, 1855. My mother's name\r\nwas Jennie Dowd. My father's name was Elias Kennedy. My mother died in\r\nGeorgia at the age of 70, and my father died in Moore County at the age\r\nof 82. I attended his funeral. My sister and her husband had carried my\r\nmother to Georgia, when my sister's husband went there to work in\r\nturpentine. My mother's husband was dead. She had married a man named\r\nStewart. You could hardly keep up with your father during slavery time.\r\nIt was a hard thing to do. There were few legal marriages. When a young\r\nman from one plantation courted a young girl on the plantation, the\r\nmaster married them, sometimes hardly knowing what he was saying.\r\n\r\nMy master was General W. D. Dowd. He lived three miles from Carthage, in\r\nMoore County, North Carolina. He owned fifty slaves. The conditions were\r\ngood. I had only ten years' experience, but it was a good experience. No\r\nman is fool enough to buy slaves to kill. I have never known a real\r\nslave owner to abuse his slaves. The abuse was done by patterollers and\r\noverseers.\r\n\r\nI have a conservative view of slavery. I taught school for four years\r\nand I have been in the ministry fifty years. I was ordained a Christian\r\nminister in 1885. I lived in Moore County until 1889, then I moved to\r\nRaleigh. I have feeling. I don't like for people to have a feeling that\r\nslaves are no more than dogs; I don't like that. It causes people to\r\nhave the wrong idea of slavery. Here is John Bectom, a well, healthy\r\nfriend of mine, 75 years of age. If we had been treated as some folks\r\nsay, these big, healthy niggers would not be walking about in the South\r\nnow. The great Negro leaders we have now would never have come out of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe places we lived in were called cabins. The Negroes who were thrifty\r\nhad nice well-kept homes; and it is thus now. The thrifty of the colored\r\nrace live well; the others who are indolent live in hovels which smell\r\nfoul and are filthy.\r\n\r\nPrayer meetings were held at night in the cabins of the slaves. On\r\nSunday we went to the white folk's church. We sat in a barred-off place,\r\nin the back of the church or in a gallery.\r\n\r\nWe had a big time at cornshuckings. We had plenty of good things to\r\neat, and plenty of whiskey and brandy to drink. These shuckings were\r\nheld at night. We had a good time, and I never saw a fight at a\r\ncornshucking in life. If we could catch the master after the shucking\r\nwas over, we put him in a chair, we darkies, and toted him around and\r\nhollered, carried him into the parlor, set him down, and combed his\r\nhair. We only called the old master \"master\". We called his wife\r\n\"missus.\" When the white children grew up we called them Mars. John,\r\nMiss Mary, etc.\r\n\r\nWe had some money. We made baskets. On moonlight nights and holidays we\r\ncleared land; the master gave us what we made on the land. We had\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe darkies also stole for deserters during the war. They paid us for\r\nit. I ate what I stole, such as sugar. I was not big enough to steal for\r\nthe deserters. I was a house boy. I stole honey. I did not know I was\r\nfree until five years after the war. I could not realize I was free.\r\nMany of us stayed right on. If we had not been ruined right after the\r\nwar by carpetbaggers our race would have been, well,--better up by this\r\ntime, because they turned us against our masters, when our masters had\r\neverything and we had nothing. The Freedmen's Bureau helped us some, but\r\nwe finally had to go back to the plantation in order to live.\r\n\r\nWe got election days, Christmas, New Year, etc., as holidays. When we\r\nwere slaves we had a week or more Christmas. The holidays lasted from\r\nChristmas Eve to after New Years. Sometimes we got passes. If our\r\nmaster would not give them to us, the white boys we played with would\r\ngive us one. We played cat, jumping, wrestling and marbles. We played\r\nfor fun; we did not play for money. There were 500 acres on the\r\nplantation. We hunted a lot, and the fur of the animals we caught we\r\nsold and had the money. We were allowed to raise a few chickens and\r\npigs, which we sold if we wanted to.\r\n\r\nThe white folks rode to church and the darkies walked, as many of the\r\npoor white folks did. We looked upon the poor white folks as our equals.\r\nThey mixed with us and helped us to envy our masters. They looked upon\r\nour masters as we did.\r\n\r\nNegro women having children by the masters was common. My relatives on\r\nmy mother's side, who were Kellys are mixed blooded. They are partly\r\nwhite. We, the darkies and many of the whites hate that a situation like\r\nthis exists. It is enough to say that seeing is believing. There were\r\nmany and are now mixed blooded people among the race.\r\n\r\nI was well clothed. Our clothes were made in looms. Shoes were made on\r\nthe plantation. Distilleries were also located on the plantation. When\r\nthey told me I was free, I did not notice it. I did not realize it till\r\nmany years after when a man made a speech at Carthage, telling us we\r\nwere free.\r\n\r\nI did not like the Yankees. We were afraid of them. We had to be\r\neducated to love the Yankees, and to know that they freed us and were\r\nour friends. I feel that Abraham Lincoln was a father to us. We consider\r\nhim thus because he freed us. The Freedmen's Bureau and carpet baggers\r\ncaused us to envy our masters and the white folks. The Ku Klux Klan,\r\nwhen we pushed our rights, came in between us, and we did not know what\r\nto do. The Ku Klux were after the carpet baggers and the Negroes who\r\nfollowed them.\r\n\r\nIt was understood that white people were not to teach Negroes during\r\nslavery, but many of the whites taught the Negroes. The children of the\r\nwhite folks made us study. I could read and write when the war was up.\r\nThey made me study books, generally a blue-back spelling book as\r\npunishment for mean things I done. My Missus, a young lady about 16\r\nyears old taught a Sunday School class of colored boys and girls. This\r\nSunday School was held at a different time of day from the white folks.\r\nSometimes old men and old women were in these classes. I remember once\r\nthey asked Uncle Ben Pearson who was meekest man, 'Moses' he replied.\r\n'Who was the wisest man?' 'Soloman', 'Who was the strongest man?' was\r\nthen asked him. To this he said 'They say Bill Medlin is the strongest,\r\nbut Tom Shaw give him his hands full.' They were men of the community.\r\nMedlin was white, Shaw was colored.\r\n\r\nI do not like the way they have messed up our songs with classical\r\nmusic. I like the songs, 'Roll Jordan Roll', 'Old Ship of Zion', 'Swing\r\nLow Sweet Chariot'. Classical singers ruin them, though.\r\n\r\nThere was no use of our going to town of Saturday afternoon to buy our\r\nrations, so we worked Saturday afternoons. When we got sick the doctors\r\ntreated us. Dr. J. D. Shaw, Dr. Bruce, and Dr. Turner. They were the\r\nfirst doctors I ever heard any tell of. They treated both whites and\r\ndarkies on my master's plantation.\r\n\r\nI married a Matthews, Anna Matthews, August 1881. We have one daughter.\r\nHer name is Ella. She married George Cheatam of Henderson, N. C. A\r\nmagistrate married us, Mr. Pitt Cameron. It was just a quiet wedding on\r\nSaturday night with about one-half dozen of my friends present.\r\n\r\nMy idea of life is to forget the bad and live for the good there is in\r\nit. This is my motto.\r\n\r\nB. N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District: No. 2                    [320079]\r\nWorker:         T.

De Yankees stopped at de plantation an' along de\r\nroad fur a rest. I 'members I had diphtheria an' a Yankee doctor come\r\nan' mopped my throat. Dey had to pull me outen under de bed so he could\r\ndoctor me.\r\n\r\nOne Yankee would come along an' give us sumptin' an another would come\r\non behind him an' take it. Dats de way dey done. One give mother a mule\r\nan' when dey done gone she sold it. A Yankee give mother a ham of meat,\r\nanother come right on behind him an' took it away from her. Dere shore\r\nwus a long line of dem Yankees. I can 'member seeing 'em march by same\r\nas it wus yisterday. I wus not old enough to work, but I 'members 'em. I\r\ndon't know 'zackly but I wus 'bout five years old when de surrender\r\nwus.\r\n\r\nMy name before I wus married wus Fannie Sessoms an' mother wus named\r\nDella Sessoms. We belonged to Dr. Isaac Sessoms an' our missus wus named\r\nHanna. My father wus named Perry Vick, after his marster who wus named\r\nPerry Vick. My missus died durin' de war an' marster never married\r\nanymore.\r\n\r\nI don't 'member much 'bout missus but mother tole me she wus some good\r\nwoman an' she loved her. Marster wus mighty good to us an' didn't allow\r\npatterollers to whip us none. De slave houses wus warm and really dey\r\nwus good houses, an' didn't leak neither.\r\n\r\nI don't 'member much 'bout my grandparents, just a little mother tole\r\nme 'bout 'em. Grandma 'longed to de Sessoms an' Dr. Isaac Sessoms\r\nbrother wus mother's father. Mother tole me dat. Look at dat picture,\r\nmister, you see you can't tell her from a white woman. Dats my mother's\r\npicture. She wus as white as you wid long hair an' a face like a white\r\nwoman. She been dead 'bout twenty years. My mother said dat we all fared\r\ngood, but course we wore homemade clothes an' wooden bottomed shoes.\r\n\r\nWe went to the white folks church at Red Oak an' Rocky Mount Missionary\r\nBaptist Churches. We were allowed to have prayer meetings at de slave\r\nhouses, two an' three times a week. I 'members goin' to church 'bout\r\nlast year of de war wid mother. I had a apple wid me an' I got hungry\r\nan' wanted to eat it in meetin' but mother jest looked at me an' touched\r\nmy arm, dat wus enough. I didn't eat de apple. I can 'member how bad I\r\nwanted to eat it. Don't 'member much 'bout dat sermon, guess I put my\r\nmind on de apple too much.\r\n\r\nMarster had about twenty slaves an' mother said dey had always been\r\nallowed to go to church an' have prayer meetings 'fore I wus born.\r\nMarster had both white an' colored overseers but he would not allow any\r\nof his overseers to bulldoze over his slaves too much. He would call a\r\noverseer down for bein' rough at de wrong time. Charles Sessoms wus one\r\nof marster's colored overseers. He 'longed to marster, an' mother said\r\nmarster always listened to what Charles said. Dey said marster had\r\nalways favored him even 'fore he made him overseer. Charles Sessoms fell\r\ndead one day an' mother found him. She called Marster Sessoms an' he\r\ncome an' jest cried. Mother said when Marster come he wus dead shore\r\nenough, dat marster jest boohooed an' went to de house, an' wouldn't\r\nlook at him no more till dey started to take him to de grave. Everybody\r\non de plantation went to his buryin' an' funeral an' some from de udder\r\nplantation dat joined ourn.\r\n\r\nI 'members but little 'bout my missus, but 'members one time she run me\r\nwhen I wus goin' home from de great house, an' she said, 'I am goin' to\r\ncatch you, now I catch you'. She pickin' at me made me love her. When\r\nshe died mother tole me 'bout her bein' dead an' took me to her buryin'.\r\nNext day I wanted to go an' get her up. I tole mother I wanted her to\r\ncome home an' eat. Mother cried an' took me up in her arms, an' said,\r\n'Honey missus will never eat here again.' I wus so young I didn't\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nDr. Sessoms an' also Dr. Drake, who married his daughter, doctored us\r\nwhen we wus sick. Dr. Joe Drake married marster's only daughter Harriet\r\nan' his only son David died in Mississippi. He had a plantation dere.\r\n\r\nI been married only once. I wus married forty years ago to Sidney Dunn.\r\nI had one chile, she's dead.\r\n\r\nFrom what I knows of slavery an' what my mother tole me I can't say it\r\nwus a bad thing.

A whole\r\nheap o' times I seed mammies sold from dere little babies, an' dar wuz\r\nno'min' den, as yo' knows.\r\n\r\nDe patterollers wuz sumpin dat I wuz skeerd of. I know jist two o' 'em,\r\nMr. Billy Allen Dunn an' Mr. Jim Ray, an' I'se hyard of some scandelous\r\nthings dat dey done. Dey do say dat dey whupped some of de niggers\r\nscandelous.\r\n\r\nWhen dey hyard dat de Yankees wuz on dere way ter hyar dey says ter us\r\ndat dem Yankees eats little nigger youngins, an' we shore stays hid.\r\n\r\nI jist seed squeamishin' parties lookin' fer sumpin' ter eat, an' I'se\r\nhyard dat dey tuck ever'thing dey comes 'crost. A whole heap of it dey\r\nflunged away, an' atterwards dey got hongry too.\r\n\r\nOne of 'em tried ter tell us dat our white folks stold us from our\r\ncountry an' brung us hyar, but since den I foun' out dat de Yankees\r\nstole us dereselves, an' den dey sold us ter our white folkses.\r\n\r\nAtter de war my pappy an' mammy brung us ter Raleigh whar I'se been\r\nlibin' since dat time. We got along putty good, an' de Yankees sont us\r\nsome teachers, but most o' us wuz so busy scramblin' roun' makin' a\r\nlivin' dat we ain't got no time fer no schools.\r\n\r\nI reckon dat hit wuz better dat de slaves wuz freed, but I still loves\r\nmy white folkses, an' dey loves me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

Dar\r\nwus five of us chilluns, Allen, Charles, Corina, Madora an' me, all\r\nborned before de war.\r\n\r\nMy mammy wus de cook, an' fur back as I 'members almost, I wus a house\r\ngirl. I fanned flies offen de table an' done a heap of little things fer\r\nMis' Betsy, Marse Peterson's wife. My pappy worked on de farm, which wus\r\nboun' ter have been a big plantation wid two hundert an' more niggers\r\nter work hit.\r\n\r\nI 'members when word come dat war wus declared, how Mis' Betsy cried\r\nan' prayed an' how Marse Peter quarreled an' walked de floor cussin' de\r\nYankees.\r\n\r\nDe war comes on jist de same an' some of de men slaves wus sent ter\r\nRoanoke ter hep buil' de fort. Yes mam, de war comes ter de great house\r\nan' ter de slave cabins jist alike.\r\n\r\nDe great house wus large an' white washed, wid green blinds an' de\r\nslave cabins wus made of slabs wid plank floors. We had plenty ter eat\r\nan' enough ter wear an' we wus happy. We had our fun an' we had our\r\ntroubles, lak little whuppin's, when we warn't good, but dat warn't\r\noften.\r\n\r\nAtter so long a time de rich folkses tried ter hire, er make de po'\r\nwhite trash go in dere places, but some of dem won't go. Dey am treated\r\nso bad dat some of dem cides ter be Ku Kluxes an' dey goes ter de woods\r\nter live. When we starts ter take up de aigs er starts from de spring\r\nhouse wid de butter an' milk dey grabs us an' takes de food fer\r\ndereselbes.\r\n\r\nDis goes on fer a long time an' finally one day in de spring I sets on\r\nde porch an' I hear a roar. I wus 'sponsible fer de goslins dem days so\r\nI sez ter de missus, 'I reckin dat I better git in de goslins case I\r\nhear hit a-thunderin'.\r\n\r\n'Dat ain't no thunder, nigger, dat am de canon', she sez.\r\n\r\n'What canon', I axes?\r\n\r\n'Why de canon what dey am fightin' wid', she sez.\r\n\r\nWell dat ebenin' I is out gittin' up de goslins when I hears music, I\r\nlooks up de road an' I sees flags, an' 'bout dat time de Yankees am dar\r\na-killin' as dey goes. Dey kills de geese, de ducks, de chickens, pigs\r\nan' ever'thing. Dey goes ter de house an' dey takes all of de meat, de\r\nmeal, an' ever'thing dey can git dere paws on.\r\n\r\nWhen dey goes ter de kitchen whar mammy am cookin' she cuss dem out an'\r\nrun dem outen her kitchen. Dey shore am a rough lot.\r\n\r\nI aint never fergot how Mis' Betsy cried when de news of de surrender\r\ncome. She aint said nothin' but Marse Peter he makes a speech sayin'\r\ndat he aint had ter sell none of us, dat he aint whupped none of us bad,\r\ndat nobody has ever run away from him yet. Den he tells us dat all who\r\nwants to can stay right on fer wages.\r\n\r\nWell we stayed two years, even do my pappy died de year atter de\r\nsurrender, den we moves ter Marse Peter's other place at Wake Forest.\r\nAtter dat we moves back ter Neuse.\r\n\r\nHit wus in de little Baptist church at Neuse whar I fust seed big black\r\nJim Dunn an' I fell in love wid him den, I reckons. He said dat he loved\r\nme den too, but hit wus three Sundays 'fore he axed ter see me home.\r\n\r\nWe walked dat mile home in front of my mammy an' I wus so happy dat I\r\naint thought hit a half a mile home. We et cornbread an' turnips fer\r\ndinner an' hit wus night 'fore he went home. Mammy wouldn't let me walk\r\nwid him ter de gate. I knowed, so I jist sot dar on de porch an' sez\r\ngood night.\r\n\r\nHe come ever' Sunday fer a year an' finally he proposed. I had told\r\nmammy dat I thought dat I ort ter be allowed ter walk ter de gate wid\r\nJim an' she said all right iffen she wus settin' dar on de porch\r\nlookin'.\r\n\r\nDat Sunday night I did walk wid Jim ter de gate an' stood under de\r\nhoneysuckles dat wus a-smellin' so sweet. I heard de big ole bullfrogs\r\na-croakin' by de riber an' de whipper-wills a-hollerin' in de woods. Dar\r\nwus a big yaller moon, an' I reckon Jim did love me. Anyhow he said so\r\nan' axed me ter marry him an' he squeezed my han'.\r\n\r\nI tol' him I'd think hit ober an' I did an' de nex' Sunday I tol' him\r\ndat I'd have him.\r\n\r\nHe aint kissed me yet but de nex' Sunday he axes my mammy fer me. She\r\nsez dat she'll have ter have a talk wid me an' let him know.\r\n\r\nWell all dat week she talks ter me, tellin' me how serious gittin'\r\nmarried is an' dat hit lasts a powerful long time.\r\n\r\nI tells her dat I knows hit but dat I am ready ter try hit an' dat I\r\nintends ter make a go of hit, anyhow.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday night mammy tells Jim dat he can have me an' yo' orter seed\r\ndat black boy grin.

Dat makes me sho\r\nnuff ole. Near 'bout a hundred an' three years done passed over dis here\r\nwhite head of mine. I'se been here, I mean I'se been here. 'Spects I'se\r\nde olest nigger in Durham. I'se been here so long dat I done forgot near\r\n'bout as much as dese here new generation niggers knows or ever gwine\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMy white fo'ks lived in Chatham County. Dey was Marse George an' Mis'\r\nBetsy Herndon. Mis Betsy was a Snipes befo' she married Marse George.\r\nDey had a big plantation an' raised cawn, wheat, cotton an' 'bacca. I\r\ndon't know how many field niggers Marse George had, but he had a mess of\r\ndem, an' he had hosses too, an' cows, hogs an' sheeps. He raised sheeps\r\nan' sold de wool, an' dey used de wool at de big house too. Dey was a\r\nbig weavin' room whare de blankets was wove, an' dey wove de cloth for\r\nde winter clothes too. Linda Hernton an' Milla Edwards was de head\r\nweavers, dey looked after de weavin' of de fancy blankets. Mis' Betsy\r\nwas a good weaver too. She weave de same as de niggers. She say she love\r\nde clackin' soun' of de loom, an' de way de shuttles run in an' out\r\ncarryin' a long tail of bright colored thread. Some days she set at de\r\nloom all de mawnin' peddlin' wid her feets an' her white han's flittin'\r\nover de bobbins.\r\n\r\nDe cardin' an' spinnin' room was full of niggers. I can hear dem\r\nspinnin' wheels now turnin' roun' an' sayin' hum-m-m-m, hum-m-m-m, an'\r\nhear de slaves singin' while dey spin. Mammy Rachel stayed in de dyein'\r\nroom. Dey wuzn' nothin' she didn' know' bout dyein'. She knew every kind\r\nof root, bark, leaf an' berry dat made red, blue, green, or whatever\r\ncolor she wanted. Dey had a big shelter whare de dye pots set over de\r\ncoals. Mammy Rachel would fill de pots wid water, den she put in de\r\nroots, bark an' stuff an' boil de juice out, den she strain it an'put in\r\nde salt an' vinegar to set de color. After de wool an' cotton done been\r\ncarded an' spun to thread, Mammy take de hanks an' drap dem in de pot of\r\nbollin' dye. She stir dem' roun' an' lif' dem up an' down wid a stick,\r\nan' when she hang dem up on de line in de sun, dey was every color of de\r\nrainbow. When dey dripped dry dey was sent to de weavin' room whare dey\r\nwas wove in blankets an' things.\r\n\r\nWhen I growed up I married Exter Durham. He belonged to Marse Snipes\r\nDurham who had de plantation 'cross de county line in Orange County. We\r\nhad a big weddin'. We was married on de front po'ch of de big house.\r\nMarse George killed a shoat an' Mis' Betsy had Georgianna, de cook, to\r\nbake a big weddin' cake all iced up white as snow wid a bride an' groom\r\nstandin' in de middle holdin' han's. De table was set out in de yard\r\nunder de trees, an' you ain't never seed de like of eats. All de niggers\r\ncome to de feas' an' Marse George had a dram for everybody. Dat was\r\nsome weddin'. I had on a white dress, white shoes an' long white gloves\r\ndat come to my elbow, an' Mis' Betsy done made me a weddin' veil out of\r\na white net window curtain. When she played de weddin ma'ch on de piano,\r\nme an' Exter ma'ched down de walk an' up on de po'ch to de altar Mis'\r\nBetsy done fixed. Dat de pretties' altar I ever seed. Back 'gainst de\r\nrose vine dat was full or red roses, Mis' Betsy done put tables filled\r\nwid flowers an' white candles. She done spread down a bed sheet, a sho\r\nnuff linen sheet, for us to stan' on, an' dey was a white pillow to\r\nkneel down on. Exter done made me a weddin' ring. He made it out of a\r\nbig red button wid his pocket knife. He done cut it so roun' an'\r\npolished it so smooth dat it looked like a red satin ribbon tide 'roun'\r\nmy finger. Dat sho was a pretty ring. I wore it 'bout fifty years, den\r\nit got so thin dat I lost it one day in de wash tub when I was washin'\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nUncle Edmond Kirby married us. He was de nigger preacher dat preached at\r\nde plantation church. After Uncle Edmond said de las' words over me an'\r\nExter, Marse George got to have his little fun: He say, 'Come on, Exter,\r\nyou an' Tempie got to jump over de broom stick backwards; you got to do\r\ndat to see which one gwine be boss of your househol'.' Everybody come\r\nstan' 'roun to watch. Marse George hold de broom 'bout a foot high off\r\nde floor. De one dat jump over it backwards an' never touch de handle,\r\ngwine boss de house, an' if bof of dem jump over widout touchin' it, dey\r\nwon't gwine be no bossin', dey jus' gwine be 'genial. I jumped fus',\r\nan' you ought to seed me. I sailed right over dat broom stick same as a\r\ncricket, but when Exter jump he done had a big dram an' his feets was so\r\nbig an' clumsy dat dey got all tangled up in dat broom an' he fell head\r\nlong. Marse George he laugh an' laugh, an' tole Exter he gwine be bossed\r\n'twell he skeered to speak less'n I tole him to speak. After de weddin'\r\nwe went down to de cabin Mis' Betsy done all dressed up, but Exter\r\ncouldn' stay no longer den dat night kaze he belonged to Marse Snipes\r\nDurham an' he had to back home. He lef' de nex day for his plantation,\r\nbut he come back every Saturday night an' stay 'twell Sunday night. We\r\nhad eleven chillun. Nine was bawn befo' surrender an' two after we was\r\nset free. So I had two chillun dat wuzn' bawn in bondage. I was worth a\r\nheap to Marse George kaze I had so manny chillun. De more chillun a\r\nslave had de more dey was worth. Lucy Carter was de only nigger on de\r\nplantation dat had more chillun den I had. She had twelve, but her\r\nchillun was sickly an' mine was muley strong an' healthy. Dey never was\r\nsick.\r\n\r\nWhen de war come Marse George was too ole to go, but young Marse Bill\r\nwent. He went an' took my brother Sim wid him. Marse Bill took Sim along\r\nto look after his hoss an' everything. Dey didn' neither one get shot,\r\nbut Mis' Betsy was skeered near 'bout to death all de time, skeered dey\r\nwas gwine be brung home shot all to pieces like some of de sojers was.\r\n\r\nDe Yankees wuzn' so bad. De mos' dey wanted was sumpin' to eat. Dey was\r\nall de time hungry, de fus' thing dey ax for when dey came was sumpin'\r\nto put in dey stomach. An' chicken! I ain' never seed even a preacher\r\neat chicken like dem Yankees. I believes to my soul dey ain' never seed\r\nno chicken 'twell dey come down here. An' hot biscuit too. I seed a\r\npassel of dem eat up a whole sack of flour one night for supper.\r\nGeorgianna sif' flour 'twell she look white an' dusty as a miller. Dem\r\nsojers didn' turn down no ham neither. Dat de onlies' thing dey took\r\nfrom Marse George. Dey went in de smoke house an' toted off de hams an'\r\nshoulders. Marse George say he come off mighty light if dat all dey\r\nwant, 'sides he got plenty of shoats anyhow.\r\n\r\nWe had all de eats we wanted while de war was shootin' dem guns, kaze\r\nMarse George was home an' he kep' de niggers workin'. We had chickens,\r\ngooses, meat, peas, flour, meal, potatoes an' things like dat all de\r\ntime, an' milk an' butter too, but we didn' have no sugar an' coffee. We\r\nused groun' pa'ched cawn for coffee an' cane 'lasses for sweetnin'. Dat\r\nwuzn' so bad wid a heap of thick cream. Anyhow, we had enough to eat to\r\n'vide wid de neighbors dat didn' have none when surrender come.\r\n\r\nI was glad when de war stopped kaze den me an' Exter could be together\r\nall de time 'stead of Saturday an' Sunday. After we was free we lived\r\nright on at Marse George's plantation a long time. We rented de lan' for\r\na fo'th of what we made, den after while be bought a farm. We paid three\r\nhundred dollars we done saved. We had a hoss, a steer, a cow an' two\r\npigs, 'sides some chickens an' fo' geese. Mis' Betsy went up in de\r\nattic an' give us a bed an' bed tick; she give us enough goose feathers\r\nto make two pillows, den she give us a table an' some chairs. She give\r\nus some dishes too. Marse George give Exter a bushel of seed cawn an\r\nsome seed wheat, den he tole him to go down to de barn an' get a bag of\r\ncotton seed. We got all dis den we hitched up de wagon an' th'owed in de\r\npassel of chillun an' moved to our new farm, an' de chillun was put to\r\nwork in de fiel'; dey growed up in de fiel' kaze dey was put to work\r\ntime dey could walk good.\r\n\r\nFreedom is all right, but de niggers was better off befo' surrender,\r\nkaze den dey was looked after an' dey didn' get in no trouble fightin'\r\nan' killin' like dey do dese days. If a nigger cut up an' got sassy in\r\nslavery times, his Ole Marse give him a good whippin' an' he went way\r\nback an' set down an' 'haved hese'f. If he was sick, Marse an' Mistis\r\nlooked after him, an' if he needed store medicine, it was bought an'\r\ngive to him; he didn' have to pay nothin'. Dey didn' even have to think'\r\nbout clothes nor nothin' like dat, dey was wove an' made an' give to\r\ndem. Maybe everybody's Marse an' Mistis wuzn' good as Marse George an'\r\nMis' Betsy, but dey was de same as a mammy an' pappy to us niggers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

I belonged to Marse Paul\r\nCameron. My pappy was Murphy McCullers. Mammy's name was Judy. Dat would\r\nmake me a McCullers, but I was always knowed as Doc Edwards an' dat is\r\nwhat I am called to dis day.\r\n\r\nI growed up to be de houseman an' I cooked for Marse Benehan,--Marse\r\nPaul's son. Marse Benehan was good to me. My health failed from doing so\r\nmuch work in de house an' so I would go for a couple of hours each day\r\nan' work in de fiel' to be out doors an' get well again.\r\n\r\nMarse Paul had so many niggers dat he never counted dem. When we opened\r\nde gate for him or met him in de road he would say, \"Who is you? Whare\r\nyou belong?\" We would say, \"We belong to Marse Paul.\" \"Alright, run\r\nalong\" he'd say den, an' he would trow us a nickel or so.\r\n\r\nWe had big work shops whare we made all de tools, an' even de shovels\r\nwas made at home. Dey was made out of wood, so was de rakes, pitchforks\r\nan' some of de hoes. Our nails was made in de blacksmith shop by han'\r\nan' de picks an' grubbin' hoes, too.\r\n\r\nWe had a han' thrashing machine. It was roun' like a stove pipe, only\r\nbigger. We fed de wheat to it an' shook it' til de wheat was loose from\r\nde straw an' when it come out at de other end it fell on a big cloth,\r\nbigger den de sheets. We had big curtains all roun' de cloth on de\r\nfloor, like a tent, so de wheat wouldn' get scattered. Den we took de\r\npitchfork an' lifted de straw up an' down so de wheat would go on de\r\ncloth. Den we moved de straw when de wheat was all loose Den we fanned\r\nde wheat wid big pieces of cloth to get de dust an' dirt outen it, so it\r\ncould be taken to de mill an' groun' when it was wanted.\r\n\r\nWhen de fall come we had a regular place to do different work. We had\r\nhan' looms an' wove our cotton an' yarn an' made de cloth what was to\r\nmake de clothes for us to wear.\r\n\r\nWe had a shop whare our shoes was made. De cobbler would make our shoes\r\nwid wooden soles.

I am 78 years old. Dat comes out right,\r\ndon't it? My mother's name was Hattie Newbury. I don't never remember\r\nseein' my Pa. We lived on Middle Sound an' dat's where I was born. I\r\nknows de room, 'twas upstairs, an' when I knowed it, underneath,\r\ndownstairs dat is, was bags of seed an' horse feed, harness an' things,\r\nbut it was slave quarters when I come heah.\r\n\r\nMe an' my mother stayed right on with Mis' Newberry after freedom, an'\r\nnever knowed no diffunce. They was jus' like sisters an' I never knowed\r\nnothin' but takin' keer of Mistus Newberry. She taught me my letters an'\r\nthe Bible, an' was mighty perticler 'bout my manners. An' I'm tellin'\r\nyou my manners is brought me a heap more money than my readin'--or de\r\nBible. I'm gwine tell you how dat is, but fust I want to say the most I\r\nlearned on Middle Sound was' bout fishin' an' huntin'. An' dawgs.\r\n\r\nMy! But there sho' was birds an' possums on de Sound in dem days.\r\nPa'tridges all over de place. Why, even me an' my Mammy et pa'tridges\r\nfer bre'kfust. Think of dat now! But when I growed up my job was\r\nfishin'. I made enough sellin' fish to the summer folks all along\r\nWrightsville and Greenville Sounds to keep me all winter.\r\n\r\nMy Mammy cooked fer Mis' Newberry. After a while they both died. I never\r\ndid'nt git married.\r\n\r\nI don't know nothin' 'bout all the mean things I hear tell about slaves\r\nan' sich. We was just one fam'ly an' had all we needed. We never paid no\r\n'tention to freedom or not freedom. I remember eve'ybody had work to do\r\nin slavery an' dey gone right on doin' it sence. An' nobody don't git\r\nnowheres settin' down holdin' their han's. It do'n make so much diffunce\r\nanyhow what you does jes so's you does it.\r\n\r\nOne time when I was carryin' in my fish to \"Airlie\" [TR: difficult to\r\nread] Mr. Pem Jones heard me laff, an' after I opened dis here mouf of\r\nmine an' laffed fer him I didn't have to bother 'bout fish no mo'.\r\nLordy, dose rich folks he used to bring down fum New Yo'k is paid me as\r\nmuch as _sixty_ dollars a week to laff fer 'em. One of 'em was named Mr.\r\n_Fish_. Now you know dat tickled _me_. I could jes laff an' laff 'bout\r\ndat. Mr. Pem give me fine clo'es an' a tall silk hat. I'd eat a big\r\ndinner in de kitchen an' den go in' mongst de quality an' laff fer' em\r\nan' make my noise like a wood saw in my th'oat. Dey was crazy 'bout dat.\r\nAn' then's when I began to be thankful 'bout my manners. I's noticed if\r\nyou has nice manners wid eve'ybody people gwine to be nice to you.\r\n\r\nWell, (with a long sigh) I don't pick up no sich money nowadays; but\r\nmy manners gives me many a chance to laff, an' I never don't go hungry.\r\n\r\nJohn has been a well known character for fifty years among the summer\r\nresidents along the sounds and on Wrightsville Beach. He was a fisherman\r\nand huckster in his palmy days, but now John's vigor is on the wane, and\r\nhe has little left with which to gain a livelihood except his unusually\r\ncontagious laugh, and a truly remarkable flow of words. \"Old John\" could\r\ngive Walter Winchel a handicap of twenty words a minute and then beat\r\nhim at his own game. His mouth is enormous and his voice deep and\r\nresonant. He can make a noise like a wood saw which he maintains for 2\r\nor 3 minutes without apparent effort, the sound buzzing on and on from\r\nsome mysterious depths of his being with amazing perfection of\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\nAny day during the baseball season John may be seen sandwiched between\r\nhis announcement boards, a large bell in one hand, crying the ball game\r\nof the day. \"Old John\" to the youngsters; but finding many a quarter\r\ndropped in his hand by the older men with memories of gay hours and\r\nhearty laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict:    No. 3                      [320198]\r\nWorker:      Daisy Whaley\r\nSubject:     EX-SLAVE\r\nStoryteller: Lindsay Faucette\r\n             Ex-Slave\r\n             Church Street,\r\n             Durham, N.

We wuz called to de big house an' taught de Bible an' dey\r\nwuz Bible readin's every day. We wuz taught to be good men an' women an'\r\nto be hones'. Marse never sold any of us niggers. But when his boys and\r\ngirls got married he would give dem some of us to take with dem.\r\n\r\nMarse never allowed us to be whipped. One time we had a white overseer\r\nan' he whipped a fiel' han' called Sam Norwood, til de blood come. He\r\nbeat him so bad dat de other niggers had to take him down to de river\r\nan' wash de blood off. When Marse come an' foun' dat out he sent dat\r\nwhite man off an' wouldn' let him stay on de plantation over night. He\r\njus' wouldn' have him roun' de place no longer. He made Uncle Whitted de\r\noverseer kase he wuz one of de oldest slaves he had an' a good nigger.\r\n\r\nWhen any of us niggers got sick Mis' Annie would come down to de cabin\r\nto see us. She brung de best wine, good chicken an' chicken soup an'\r\neverything else she had at de big house dat she thought we would like,\r\nan' she done everything she could to get us well again.\r\n\r\nMarse John never worked us after dark. We worked in de day an' had de\r\nnights to play games an' have singin's. We never cooked on a Sunday.\r\nEverything we ett on dat day was cooked on Saturday. Dey wuzn' lighted\r\nin de cook stoves or fire places in de big house or cabins neither.\r\nEverybody rested on Sunday. De tables wuz set an' de food put on to eat,\r\nbut nobody cut any wood an' dey wuzn' no other work don' on dat day.\r\nMammy Beckie wuz my gran'mammy an' she toted de keys to de pantry an'\r\nsmoke house, an' her word went wid Marse John an' Mis' Annie.\r\n\r\nMarse John wuz a great lawyer an' when he went to Pittsboro an' other\r\nplaces to practice, if he wuz to stay all night, Mis' Annie had my mammy\r\nsleep right in bed wid her, so she wouldn' be 'fraid.\r\n\r\nMarse an Mistis had three sons an' three daughters,--De oldest son wuz\r\nnot able to go to war. He had studied so hard dat it had 'fected his\r\nmind, so he stayed at home. De secon' son, named Albert, went to war an'\r\nwuz brought back dead with a bullet hole through his head. Dat liked to\r\nhave killed Marse John an' Mis' Annie. Dey wuz three girls, named, Mis'\r\nMaggie, Mis' Ella Bella and Mis' Rebena.\r\n\r\nI wuz de cow-tender. I took care of de cows an' de calves. I would have\r\nto hold de calf up to de mother cow 'til de milk would come down an' den\r\nI would have to hold it away 'til somebody done de milkin'. I tended de\r\nhorses, too, an' anything else dat I wuz told to do.\r\n\r\nWhen de war started an' de Yankees come, dey didn' do much harm to our\r\nplace. Marse had all de silver an' money an' other things of value hid\r\nunder a big rock be de river an' de Yankees never did fine anything dat\r\nwe hid.\r\n\r\nOur own sojers did more harm on our plantation den de Yankees. Dey\r\ncamped in de woods an' never did have nuff to eat an' took what dey\r\nwanted. An' lice! I ain't never seed de like. It took fifteen years for\r\nus to get shed of de lice dat de sojers lef' behind. You jus' couldn'\r\nget dem out of your clothes les' you burned dem up. Dey wuz hard to get\r\nshed of.\r\n\r\nAfter de war wuz over Marse John let Pappy have eighteen acres of land\r\nfor de use of two of his boys for a year. My pappy made a good crop of\r\ncorn, wheat an' other food on dis land. Dey wuz a time when you couldn'\r\nfind a crust of bread or piece of meat in my mammy's pantry for us to\r\neat, an' when she did get a little meat or bread she would divide it\r\nbetween us chillun, so each would have a share an' go without herself\r\nan' never conplained.\r\n\r\nWhen pappy wuz makin' his crop some of de others would ask him why he\r\ndidn' take up some of his crop and get somethin' to eat. He would answer\r\nan' say dat when he left dat place he intended to take his crop with him\r\nan' he did. He took plenty of corn, wheat, potatoes an' other food, a\r\ncow, her calf, mule an' hogs an' he moved to a farm dat he bought.\r\n\r\nLater on in years my pappy an mammy come here in Durham an' bought a\r\nhome. I worked for dem' til I wuz thirty-two years old an' give dem what\r\nmoney I earned. I worked for as little as twenty-five cents a day. Den I\r\ngot a dray an' hauled for fifteen cents a load from de Durham depo' to\r\nWest Durham for fifteen years. Little did I think at dat time dat I\r\nwould ever have big trucks an' a payroll of $6,000.00 a year. De good\r\nLawd has blest me all de way, an' all I have is His'n, even to my own\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nDen one day I went back home to see my old Marse an' I foun' him sittin'\r\nin a big chair on de po'ch an' his health wuzn' so good. He sed,\r\n\"Lindsey, why don' you stop runnin' roun' wid de girls an' stop you\r\ncou't 'n? You never will get nowhere makin' all de girls love you an' den\r\nyou walk away an' make up with some other girl. Go get yourself a good\r\ngirl an' get married an' raise a family an' be somebody.\" An' I did. I\r\nquit all de girls an' I foun' a fine girl and we wuz married. I sho got\r\na good wife; I got one of de best women dat could be foun' an' we lived\r\ntogether for over forty-five years. Den she died six years ago now, an'\r\nI sho miss her for she wuz a real help-mate all through dese years. We\r\nraised five chillun an' educated dem to be school teachers an' other\r\ntrades.\r\n\r\nI have tried to live de way I wuz raised to. My wife never worked a day\r\naway from home all de years we wuz married. It wuz my raisin an' my\r\nstrong faith in my Lawd an' Marster dat helped me to get along as well\r\nas I have, an' I bless Him every day for de strength He has given me to\r\nbring up my family as well as I have. Der is only one way to live an'\r\ndat is de right way. Educate your chillun, if you can, but be sho you\r\ngive dem de proper moral training at home. De right way to raise your\r\nchillun is to larn dem to have manners and proper respect for their\r\nparents, be good citizens an' God fearin' men an' women. When you have\r\ndone dat you will not be ashamed of dem in your old age.

I wus born in Raleigh near the Professional\r\nBuilding, in the year 1860, October 16. My mother wus named Jane Busbee.\r\nHer marster wus Quent Busbee, a lawyer. Her missus wus Julia Busbee. She\r\nwus a Taylor before she married Mr. Busbee. Now I tell you, I can't tell\r\nyou exactly, but the old heads died. The old heads were the Scurlocks\r\nwho lived in Chatham County. I heard their names but I don't remember\r\nthem. Their children when they died drawed for the slaves and my mother\r\nwus brought to Raleigh when she wus eight years old. She came from the\r\nScurlocks to the Busbees. The Taylors were relatives of the Scurlocks,\r\nand were allowed to draw, and Julia Taylor drawed my mother. It wus\r\nfixed so the slaves on this estate could not be sold, but could be\r\ndrawed for by the family and relatives. She got along just middlin'\r\nafter her missus died. When her missus died, mother said she had to look\r\nafter herself. Mr. Busbee would not allow anyone to whip mother. He\r\nmarried Miss Lizzie Bledsoe the second time.\r\n\r\nI wus only a child and, of course, I thought as I could get a little\r\nsomething to eat everything wus all right, but we had few comforts. We\r\nhad prayer meeting and we went to the white people's church. I heard\r\nmother say that they had to be very careful what they said in their\r\nworship. Lots of time dey put us children to bed and went off.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the surrender, I heard a lot about the patterollers,\r\nbut I did not know what they were. Children wus not as wise then as they\r\nare now. They didn't know as much about things.\r\n\r\nYes sir, I remember the Yankees coming to Raleigh, we had been taken\r\nout to Moses Bledsoe's place on Holleman's Road to protect Mr. Bledsoe's\r\nthings. They said if they put the things out there, and put a family of\r\nNegroes there the Yankees would not bother the things. So they stored a\r\nlot of stuff there, and put my mother an' a slave man by the name o' Tom\r\nGillmore there. Two Negro families were there. We children watched the\r\nYankees march by.\r\n\r\nThe Yankees went through everything, and when mother wouldn't tell them\r\nwhere the silver wus hid they threw her things in the well. Mother\r\ncried, an' when the Yankee officers heard of it they sent a guard there\r\nto protect us. The colored man, Tom Gillmore, wus so scared, he and his\r\nfamily moved out at night leaving my mother alone with her family. The\r\nYankees ate the preserves and all the meat and other things. They\r\ndestroyed a lot they could not eat.\r\n\r\nMother and me stayed on with marster after the surrender, and stayed\r\non his place till he died. After that we moved to Peck's Place, called\r\nPeck's Place because the property wus sold by Louis Peck. It wus also\r\ncalled the 'Save-rent' section, then in later years Oberlin Road.\r\n\r\nI think slavery wus a bad thing, while it had its good points in\r\nbuilding good strong men. In some cases where marsters were bad it wus a\r\nbad thing.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln wus our friend, he set us free. I don't know much about\r\nBooker T. Washington. Mr Roosevelt is all right. Jim Young seemed to be\r\nall right. Jeff Davis didn't bother me. I guess he wus all right.\r\n\r\nEH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

She said dey wus a whole\r\nlot meaner den dey had any business bein'. Dey allowed de patterollers\r\nto snoop around an' whup de slaves, mother said dey stripped some of de\r\nslaves naked an' whupped 'em. She said women had to work all day in de\r\nfields an' come home an' do de house work at night while de white folks\r\nhardly done a han's turn of work.\r\n\r\nMarse Kerney had a sluice of chilluns. I can't think of 'em all, but I\r\n'members Calvin, James, Allen, Emily, Helen, an' I jest can't think of\r\nde rest of de chilluns names.\r\n\r\nMother said dey gathered slaves together like dey did horses an' sold\r\n'em on de block. Mother said dey carried some to Rolesville in Wake\r\nCounty an' sold 'em. Dey sold Henry Temples an' Lucinda Upchurch from\r\nmarster's plantation, but dey carried 'em to Raleigh to sell 'em.\r\n\r\nWe wore homemade clothes an' shoes wid wooden bottoms. Dey would not\r\nallow us to sing an' pray but dey turned pots down at de door an' sung\r\nan' prayed enyhow an' de Lord heard dere prayers.

Dey wus not allowed to cook anything for demselves at\r\nde cabins no time 'cept night. Dere wus a cook who cooked fur all durin'\r\nde day. Sometimes de field han's had to work 'round de place at night\r\nafter comin' in from de fields.

I am 76 years old. My name is Frank Freeman and my wife's name is\r\nMary Freeman. She is 78 years old. We live at 216 Tuppers Lane, Raleigh,\r\nWake County, North Carolina. I belonged to ole man Jim Wiggins jus' this\r\nside o' Roseville, fourteen miles from Raleigh. The great house is\r\nstandin' there now, and a family by the name o' Gill, a colored man's\r\nfamily, lives there. The place is owned by ole man Jim Wiggins's\r\ngrandson, whose name is O. B. Wiggins. My wife belonged to the Terrells\r\nbefore the surrender. I married after the war. I was forty years ole\r\nwhen I was married.\r\n\r\nOld man Jim Wiggins was good to his niggers, and when the slave\r\nchildren were taken off by his children they treated us good. Missus\r\ndressed mother up in her clothes and let her go to church. We had good,\r\nwell cooked food, good clothes, and good places to sleep. Some of the\r\nchimneys which were once attached to the slave houses are standing on\r\nthe plantation. The home plantation in Wake County was 3000 acres.\r\n\r\nMarster also owned three and a quarter plantations in Franklin County.\r\nHe kept about ten men at home and would not let his slave boys work\r\nuntil they were 18 years old, except tend to horses and do light jobs\r\naround the house. He had slaves on all his plantations but they were\r\nunder colored overseers who were slaves themselves. Marster had three\r\nboys and five girls, eight children of his own.\r\n\r\nOne of the girls was Siddie Wiggins. When she married Alfred Holland,\r\nand they went to Smithfield to live she took me with her, when I was two\r\nyears old. She thought so much o' me mother was willing to let me go.\r\nMother loved Miss Siddie, and it was agreeable in the family. I stayed\r\nright on with her after the surrender three years until 1868. My father\r\ndecided to take me home then and went after me.\r\n\r\nThey never taught us books of any kind. I was about 8 years old when I\r\nbegan to study books. When I was 21 Christmas Eve 1880, father told me I\r\nwas my own man and that was all he had to give me.\r\n\r\nI had decided many years before to save all my nickles. I kept them in\r\na bag. I did not drink, chew, smoke or use tobacco in any way during\r\nthis time. When he told me I was free I counted up my money and found I\r\nhad $47.75. I had never up to this tasted liquor or tobacco. I don't\r\nknow anything about it yet. I have never used it. With that money I\r\nentered Shaw University. I worked eight hours a week in order to help\r\npay my way.\r\n\r\nLater I went into public service, teaching four months a year in the\r\npublic schools. My salary was $25.00 per month. I kept going to school\r\nat Shaw until I could get a first grade teacher's certificate. I never\r\ngraduated. I taught in the public schools for 43 years. I would be\r\nteaching now, but I have high blood pressure.\r\n\r\nI was at Master Hollands at Smithfield when the Yankees came through.\r\nThey went into my Marster's store and began breaking up things and\r\ntaking what they wanted. They were dressed in blue and I did not know\r\nwho they were. I asked and someone told me they were the Yankees.\r\n\r\nMy father was named Burton, and my mother was named Queen Anne. Father\r\nwas a Freeman and mother was a Wiggins.\r\n\r\nThere were no churches on the plantation. My father told me a story\r\nabout his young master, Joe Freeman and my father's brother Soloman.\r\nMarster got Soloman to help whip him. My father went in to see young\r\nMissus and told her about it, and let her know he was going away. He had\r\ngot the cradle blade and said he would kill either of them if they\r\nbothered him. Father had so much Indian blood in him that he would\r\nfight. He ran away and stayed four years and passed for a free nigger.\r\nHe stayed in the Bancomb Settlement in Johnson County. When he came home\r\nbefore the war ended, Old Marster said, 'Soloman why didn't you stay?'\r\nfather said, 'I have been off long enough'. Marster said 'Go to work',\r\nand there was no more to it. Father helped build the breastworks in the\r\nEastern part of the State down at Ft. Fisher. He worked on the forts at\r\nNew Bern too.\r\n\r\nI think Abraham Lincoln worked hard for our freedom. He was a great\r\nman. I think Mr. Roosevelt is a good man and is doing all he can for the\r\ngood of all.\r\n\r\nLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

I wus born a slave Jan. 6, 1863 on a\r\nplantation near Millburnie, Wake County, owned by Major Wilder, who\r\nhired my father's time. His wife wus named Sarah Wilder. I don't know\r\nanything 'bout slavery 'cept what wus tole me by father and mother but I\r\ndo know that if it had not been for what de southern white folks done\r\nfor us niggers we'd have perished to death. De north turned us out wid\r\nout anything to make a livin' wid.\r\n\r\nMy father wus David Gill and, my mother wus Emily Gill. My father wus a\r\nblacksmith an he moved from place to place where dey hired his time.\r\nDats why I wus born on Major Wilders place. Marster Gill who owned us\r\nhired father to Major Wilder and mother moved wid him. For a longtime\r\natter de war, nine years, we stayed on wid Major Wilder, de place we wus\r\nat when dey set us free.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilder had a large plantation and owned a large number of slaves\r\nbefore de surrender. I only 'members fourteen of de ones I know belonged\r\nto him. Mr. Wilder wus a mighty good man. We had plenty to eat an plenty\r\nwork to do. Dere wus seven in the Major's family. Three boys, two girls,\r\nhe an his wife. His boys wus named Sam, Will and Crockett. De girls wus\r\nnamed Florence and Flora. Dey are all dead, every one of 'em. De whole\r\nset. I don't know nary one of 'em dats livin. If dey wus livin I could\r\ngo to 'em an' git a meal any time. Yes Sir! any time, day or night.\r\n\r\nI farmed for a long time for myself atter I wus free from my father at\r\n21 years of age. Den 'bout twelve years ago I come to Raleigh and got a\r\njob as butler at St. Augustine Episcopal College for Colored. I worked\r\ndere eight years, wus taken sick while workin dere an has been unable to\r\nwork much since. Dat wus four years ago. Since den sometimes I ain't\r\nable to git up outen my cheer when I is settin down. I tells you,\r\nmister, when a nigger leaves de farm an comes to town to live he sho is\r\ntakin a mighty big chance wid de wolf. He is just a riskin parishin,\r\ndats what he is a doin.\r\n\r\nI married forty five years ago this past November. I wus married on de\r\nsecond Thursday night in November to Millie Ruffin of Wake County, North\r\nCarolina. We had leben chilluns, six boys an five gals. Four of the boys\r\nan one of de gals is livin now. Some of my chilluns went north but dey\r\ndidn't stay dere but two months. De one dat went north wus Sam, dat wus\r\nde oldest one. He took a notion to marry so he went up to Pennsylvania\r\nand worked. Just as soon as he got enough money to marry on he come back\r\nan got married. He never went back north no more.\r\n\r\nMother belonged to Sam Krenshaw before she wus bought by Marster Gill.\r\nHer missus when she was a girl growin up wus Mrs. Louise Krenshaw. De\r\nmissus done de whuppin on Mr. Krenshaw's plantation an she wus mighty\r\nrough at times. She whupped mother an cut her back to pieces so bad dat\r\nde scars wus on her when she died. Father died in Raleigh an mother died\r\nout on Miss Annie Ball's farm 'bout seven miles from Raleigh. Mother an\r\nfather wus livin there when mother died. Father den come to Raleigh an\r\ndied here.\r\n\r\nI caint read an write but all my chilluns can read and write. Mother\r\nand father could not read or write. I haint had no chance. I had no\r\nlarnin. I had to depend on white folks I farmed wid to look atter my\r\nbusiness. Some of em cheated me out of what I made. I am tellin you de\r\ntruth 'bout some of de landlords, dey got mighty nigh all I made. Mr.\r\nRichard Taylor who owned a farm near Raleigh whur I stayed two years wus\r\none of em. He charged de same thing three times an I had it to pay. I\r\nstayed two years an made nothin'. Dis is de truth from my heart, from\r\nhere to glory. I members payin' fur a middlin of meat twice. Some of de\r\nwhite folks looked out fur me an prospered. Mr. Dave Faulk wus one of\r\n'em. I stayed wid him six years and I prospered. Mr. John Bushnell wus a\r\nman who took up no time wid niggers. I rented from him a long time.\r\n\r\nHe furnished a nigger cash to run his crap on. De nigger made de crap\r\nsold it an carried him his part. He figgered 'bout what he should have\r\nan de nigger paid in cash. He wus a mighty good man to his nigger\r\ntenants. I never owned a farm, I never owned horses or mules to farm\r\nwith. I worked de landlords stock and farmed his land on shares. Farmin'\r\nhas been my happiest life and I wushes I wus able to farm agin cause I\r\nam happiest when on de farm.\r\n\r\nI had a quiet home weddin' an I wus married by a white magistrate. I\r\ngot up one night an' wus married at 1 o'clock.\r\n\r\nAtter de weddin she went back home wid me. We have had our ups and\r\ndowns in life. Sometimes de livin' has been mighty hard, but dere has\r\nnever been a time since I been free when I could not git a handout from\r\nde white folks back yard.\r\n\r\nLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

Andrews\r\n\r\n[TR: Date Stamp \"SEP 10 1937\"]\r\n\r\nROBERT GLENN 207 Idlewild Avenue Raleigh, North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was a slave before and during the Civil War. I am 87 years old. I was\r\nborn Sept. 16, 1850. I was born in Orange County, North Carolina near\r\nHillsboro. At that time Durham was just a platform at the station and no\r\nhouse there whatever. The platform was lighted with a contraption shaped\r\nlike a basket and burning coal that gave off a blaze. There were holes\r\nin this metal basket for the cinders to fall through.\r\n\r\nI belonged to a man named Bob Hall, he was a widower. He had three\r\nsons, Thomas, Nelson, and Lambert. He died when I was eight years old\r\nand I was put on the block and sold in Nelson Hall's yard by the son of\r\nBob Hall. I saw my brother and sister sold on this same plantation. My\r\nmother belonged to the Halls, and father belonged to the Glenns. They\r\nsold me away from my father and mother and I was carried to the state of\r\nKentucky. I was bought by a Negro speculator by the name of Henry long\r\nwho lived not far from Hurdles Mill in Person County. I was not allowed\r\nto tell my mother and father goodbye. I was bought and sold three times\r\nin one day.\r\n\r\nMy father's time was hired out and as he knew a trade he had by working\r\novertime saved up a considerable amount of money. After the speculator,\r\nHenry Long, bought me, mother went to father and pled with him to buy me\r\nfrom him and let the white folks hire me out. No slave could own a\r\nslave. Father got the consent and help of his owners to buy me and they\r\nasked Long to put me on the block again. Long did so and named his price\r\nbut when he learned who had bid me off he backed down. Later in the day\r\nhe put me on the block and named another price much higher than the\r\nprice formerly set. He was asked by the white folks to name his price\r\nfor his bargain and he did so. I was again put on the auction block and\r\nfather bought me in, putting up the cash. Long then flew into a rage and\r\ncursed my father saying, 'you damn black son of a bitch, you think you\r\nare white do you? Now just to show you are black, I will not let you\r\nhave your son at any price.' Father knew it was all off, mother was\r\nfrantic but there was nothing they could do about it. They had to stand\r\nand see the speculator put me on his horse behind him and ride away\r\nwithout allowing either of them to tell me goodbye. I figure I was sold\r\nthree times in one day, as the price asked was offered in each instance.\r\nMother was told under threat of a whupping not to make any outcry when I\r\nwas carried away. He took me to his home, but on the way he stopped for\r\nrefreshments, at a plantation, and while he was eating and drinking, he\r\nput me into a room where two white women were spinning flax. I was given\r\na seat across the room from where they were working. After I had sat\r\nthere awhile wondering where I was going and thinking about mother and\r\nhome, I went to one of the women and asked, 'Missus when will I see my\r\nmother again?' She replied, I don't know child, go and sit down. I went\r\nback to my seat and as I did so both the women stopped spinning for a\r\nmoment, looked at each other, and one of them remarked. \"Almighty God,\r\nthis slavery business is a horrible thing. Chances are this boy will\r\nnever see his mother again.\" This remark nearly killed me, as I began to\r\nfully realize my situation. Long, the Negro trader, soon came back, put\r\nme on his horse and finished the trip to his home. He kept me at his\r\nhome awhile and then traded me to a man named William Moore who lived in\r\nPerson County. Moore at this time was planning to move to Kentucky which\r\nhe soon did, taking me with him. My mother found out by the \"Grapevine\r\ntelegraph\" that I was going to be carried to Kentucky. She got\r\npermission and came to see me before they carried me off. When she\r\nstarted home I was allowed to go part of the way with her but they sent\r\ntwo Negro girls with us to insure my return. We were allowed to talk\r\nprivately, but while we were doing so, the two girls stood a short\r\ndistance away and watched as the marster told them when they left that\r\nif I escaped they would be whipped every day until I was caught. When\r\nthe time of parting came and I had to turn back, I burst out crying\r\nloud. I was so weak from sorrow I could not walk, and the two girls who\r\nwere with me took me by each arm and led me along half carrying me.\r\n\r\nThis man Moore carried me and several other slaves to Kentucky. We\r\ntraveled by train by way of Nashville, Tenn. My thoughts are not\r\nfamiliar with the happenings of this trip but I remember that we walked\r\na long distance at one place on the trip from one depot to another.\r\n\r\nWe finally reached Kentucky and Moore stopped at his brother's\r\nplantation until he could buy one, then we moved on it. My marster was\r\nnamed William Moore and my missus was named Martha Whitfield Moore. It\r\nwas a big plantation and he hired a lot of help and had white tenants\r\nbesides the land he worked with slaves. There were only six slaves used\r\nas regular field hands during his first year in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe food was generally common. Hog meat and cornbread most all the\r\ntime. Slaves got biscuits only on Sunday morning. Our clothes were poor\r\nand I worked barefooted most of the time, winter and summer. No books,\r\npapers or anything concerning education was allowed the slaves by his\r\nrules and the customs of these times.\r\n\r\nMarster Moore had four children among whom was one boy about my age.\r\nThe girls were named Atona, Beulah, and Minnie, and the boy was named\r\nCrosby. He was mighty brilliant. We played together. He was the only\r\nwhite boy there, and he took a great liking to me, and we loved each\r\ndevotedly. Once in an undertone he asked me how would I like to have an\r\neducation. I was overjoyed at the suggestion and he at once began to\r\nteach me secretly. I studied hard and he soon had me so I could read and\r\nwrite well. I continued studying and he continued teaching me. He\r\nfurnished me books and slipped all the papers he could get to me and I\r\nwas the best educated Negro in the community without anyone except the\r\nslaves knowing what was going on.\r\n\r\nAll the slaves on marster's plantation lived the first year we spent in\r\nKentucky in a one room house with one fireplace. There was a dozen or\r\nmore who all lived in this one room house. Marster built himself a large\r\nhouse having seven rooms. He worked his slaves himself and never had any\r\noverseers. We worked from sun to sun in the fields and then worked at\r\nthe house after getting in from the fields as long as we could see. I\r\nhave never seen a patteroller but when I left the plantation in slavery\r\ntime I got a pass. I have never seen a jail for slaves but I have seen\r\nslaves whipped and I was whipped myself. I was whipped particularly\r\nabout a saddle I left out in the night after using it during the day. My\r\nflesh was cut up so bad that the scars are on me to this day.\r\n\r\nWe were not allowed to have prayer meetings, but we went to the white\r\nfolks church to services sometimes. There were no looms, mills, or shops\r\non the plantation at Marster Moore's. I kept the name of Glenn through\r\nall the years as Marster Moore did not change his slaves names to his\r\nfamily name. My mother was named Martha Glenn and father was named Bob\r\nGlenn.\r\n\r\nI was in the field when I first heard of the Civil War. The woman who\r\nlooked after Henry Hall and myself (both slaves) told me she heard\r\nmarster say old Abraham Lincoln was trying to free the niggers. Marster\r\nfinally pulled me up and went and joined the Confederate Army. Kentucky\r\nsplit and part joined the North and part the South. The war news kept\r\nslipping through of success for first one side then the other. Sometimes\r\nmarster would come home, spend a few days and then go again to the war.\r\nIt seemed he influenced a lot of men to join the southern army, among\r\nthem was a man named Enoch Moorehead. Moorehead was killed in a few days\r\nafter he joined the southern army.\r\n\r\nMarster Moore fell out with a lot of his associates in the army and\r\nsome of them who were from the same community became his bitter enemies.\r\nTom Foushee was one of them. Marster became so alarmed over the threats\r\non his life made by Foushee and others that he was afraid to stay in his\r\nown home at night, and he built a little camp one and one half miles\r\nfrom his home and he and missus spent their nights there on his visits\r\nhome. Foushee finally came to the great house one night heavily armed,\r\ncame right on into the house and inquired for marster. We told him\r\nmarster was away. Foushee lay down on the floor and waited a long time\r\nfor him. Marster was at the little camp but we would not tell where he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nFoushee left after spending most of the night at marster's. As he went\r\nout into the yard, when leaving, marster's bull dog grawled at him and\r\nhe shot him dead.\r\n\r\nMarster went to Henderson, Kentucky, the County seat of Henderson\r\nCounty, and surrendered to the Federal Army and took the Oath of\r\nAllegiance. Up to that time I had seen a few Yankees. They stopped now\r\nand then at marster's and got their breakfast. They always asked about\r\nbuttermilk, they seemed to be very fond of it. They were also fond of\r\nham, but we had the ham meat buried in the ground, this was about the\r\nclose of the war. A big army of Yankees came through a few months later\r\nand soon we heard of the surrender. A few days after this marster told\r\nme to catch two horses that we had to go to Dickenson which was the\r\nCounty seat of Webster County. On the way to Dickenson he said to me,\r\n'Bob, did you know you are free and Lincoln has freed you? You are as\r\nfree as I am.' We went to the Freedmen's Bureau and went into the\r\noffice. A Yankee officer looked me over and asked marster my name, and\r\ninformed me I was free, and asked me whether or not I wanted to keep\r\nliving with Moore. I did not know what to do, so I told him yes. A fixed\r\nprice of seventy-five dollars and board was then set as the salary I\r\nshould receive per year for my work. The Yankees told me to let him know\r\nif I was not paid as agreed.\r\n\r\nI went back home and stayed a year. During the year I hunted a lot at\r\nnight and thoroughly enjoyed being free. I took my freedom by degrees\r\nand remained obedient and respectful, but still wondering and thinking\r\nof what the future held for me. After I retired at night I made plan\r\nafter plan and built aircastles as to what I would do. At this time I\r\nformed a great attachment for the white man, Mr. Atlas Chandler, with\r\nwhom I hunted. He bought my part of the game we caught and favored me in\r\nother ways. Mr. Chandler had a friend, Mr. Dewitt Yarborough, who was an\r\nadventurer, and trader, and half brother to my ex-marster, Mr. Moore,\r\nwith whom I was then staying. He is responsible for me taking myself\r\ninto my own hands and getting out of feeling I was still under\r\nobligations to ask my marster or missus when I desired to leave the\r\npremises. Mr. Yarborough's son was off at school at a place called\r\nKiloh, Kentucky, and he wanted to carry a horse to him and also take\r\nalong some other animals for trading purposes. He offered me a new pair\r\nof pants to make the trip for him and I accepted the job. I delivered\r\nthe horse to his son and started for home. On the way back I ran into\r\nUncle Squire Yarborough who once belonged to Dewitt Yarborough. He\r\npersuaded me to go home with him and go with him to a wedding in Union\r\nCounty, Kentucky. The wedding was twenty miles away and we walked the\r\nentire distance. It was a double wedding, two couples were married.\r\nGeorgianna Hawkins was married to George Ross and Steve Carter married a\r\nwoman whose name I do not remember. This was in the winter during the\r\nChristmas Holidays and I stayed in the community until about the first\r\nof January, then I went back home. I had been thinking for several days\r\nbefore I went back home as to just what I must tell Mr. Moore and as to\r\nhow he felt about the matter, and what I would get when I got home. In\r\nmy dilema I almost forgot I was free.\r\n\r\nI got home at night and my mind and heart was full but I was surprised\r\nat the way he treated me. He acted kind and asked me if I was going to\r\nstay with him next year. I was pleased. I told him, yes sir! and then I\r\nlay down and went to sleep. He had a boss man on his plantation then and\r\nnext morning he called me, but I just couldn't wake. I seemed to be in a\r\ntrance or something, I had recently lost so much sleep. He called me the\r\nsecond time and still I di [HW: d] not get up. Then he came in and\r\nspanked my head. I jumped up and went to work feeding the stock and\r\nsplitting wood for the day's cooking and fires. I then went in and ate\r\nmy breakfast. Mr. Moore told me to hitch a team of horses to a wagon and\r\ngo to a neighbors five miles away for a load of hogs. I refused to do\r\nso. They called me into the house and asked me what I was going to do\r\nabout it. I said I do not know. As I said that I stepped out of the\r\ndoor and left. I went straight to the county seat and hired to Dr.\r\nGeorge Rasby in Webster County for one hundred dollars per year. I\r\nstayed there one year. I got uneasy in Kentucky. The whites treated the\r\nblacks awful bad so I decided to go to Illinois as I thought a Negro\r\nmight have a better chance there, it being a northern state. I was\r\nkindly treated and soon began to save money, but all through the years\r\nthere was a thought that haunted me in my dreams and in my waking hours,\r\nand this thought was of my mother, whom I had not seen or heard of in\r\nmany years. Finally one cold morning in early December I made a vow that\r\nI was going to North Carolina and see my mother if she was still living.\r\nI had plenty of money for the trip. I wrote the postmaster in Roxboro,\r\nNorth Carolina, asking him to inform my mother I was still living, and\r\ntelling him the circumstances, mailing a letter at the same time telling\r\nher I was still alive but saying nothing of my intended visit to her. I\r\nleft Illinois bound for North Carolina on December 15th and in a few\r\ndays I was at my mother's home. I tried to fool them. There were two men\r\nwith me and they called me by a ficticious name, but when I shook my\r\nmother's hand I held it a little too long and she suspicioned something\r\nstill she held herself until she was more sure. When she got a chance\r\nshe came to me and said ain't you my child? Tell me ain't you my child\r\nwhom I left on the road near Mr. Moore's before the war? I broke down\r\nand began to cry. Mother nor father did not know me, but mother\r\nsuspicioned I was her child. Father had a few days previously remarked\r\nthat he did not want to die without seeing his son once more. I could\r\nnot find language to express my feeling. I did not know before I came\r\nhome whether my parents were dead or alive. This Christmas I spent in\r\nthe county and state of my birth and childhood; with mother, father and\r\nfreedom was the happiest period of my entire life, because those who\r\nwere torn apart in bondage and sorrow several years previous were now\r\nunited in freedom and happiness.\r\n\r\nEH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

Dey wuz preachin'\r\nevery other Sunday an' Sunday School every Sunday. Marse Billy an' Mis'\r\nRoby teached de Sunday School, but dey didn' teach us to read an' write,\r\nno suh, dey sho didn'. If dey'd see us wid er book dey'd whip us. Dey\r\nsaid niggers didn' need no knowledge; dat dey mus' do what dey wuz tole\r\nto do. Marse Billy wuz er doctor too. He doctored de slaves when dey got\r\nsick, an' if dey got bad off he sen' for er sho nuff doctor an' paid de\r\nbills.\r\n\r\nEvery Chris'mas Marse Billy give de niggers er big time. He called dem\r\nup to de big house an' give dem er bag of candy, niggertoes, an' sugar\r\nplums, den he say: 'Who wants er egg nog, boys?' All dem dat wants er\r\ndram hol' up dey han's.' Yo' never seed such holdin' up of han's. I\r\nwould hol' up mine too, an' Ole Marse would look at me an say, 'Go 'way\r\nfrom hear, Sarah Anne, yo' too little to be callin' for nog.' But he\r\nfill up de glass jus' de same an' put in er extra spoon of sugar an'\r\ngive it to me. Dat sho wuz good nog. 'Twuz all foamy wid whipped cream\r\nan' rich wid eggs. Marse Billy an' Mis' Roby served it demselves from\r\ndey Sunday cut glass nog bowl, an' it kept Estella an' Rosette busy\r\nfillin' it up. Marse Billy wuz er good man.\r\n\r\nWhen de war come on Marse Billy was too ole to go, but young Marse Billy\r\nan' Marse Gaston went. Dey wuz Ole Marse's two boys. Young Marse Billy\r\nHeaden, Mis' Susie's husban' went too.\r\n\r\nDe day Ole Marse heard dat de Yankees wuz comin' he took all de meat\r\n'cept two or three pieces out of de smoke house, den he got de silver\r\nan' things an' toted dem to de wood pile. He dug er hole an' buried dem,\r\nden he covered de place wid chips, but wid dat he wuzn' satisfied, so he\r\nmade pappy bring er load of wood an' throw it on top of it, so when de\r\nYankees come dey didn' fin' it.\r\n\r\nWhen de Yankees come up in de yard Marse Billy took Mis' Roby an' locked\r\nher up in dey room, den he walk 'roun' an' watched de Yankees, but dey\r\ntoted off what dey wanted. I wuzn' skeered of de Yankees; I thought dey\r\nwuz pretty mens in dey blue coats an' brass buttons. I followed dem all\r\n'roun' beggin' for dey coat buttons. I ain't never seed nothin' as\r\npretty as dem buttons. When dey lef' I followed dem way down de road\r\nstill beggin', 'twell one of dem Yankees pull off er button an' give it\r\nto me. 'Hear, Nigger,' he say, 'take dis button. I's givin' it to you\r\nkaze yo's got blue eyes. I ain't never seed blue eyes in er black face\r\nbefo'.' I had blue eyes like pappy an' Marse Billy, an' I kept dat\r\nYankee button 'twell I wuz ma'ied, den I los' it.\r\n\r\nDe wus' thing I know dat happened, in de war wuz when Mis' Roby foun' de\r\nYankee sojer in de ladies back house.\r\n\r\nDown at de back of de garden behin' de row of lilac bushes wuz de two\r\nback houses, one for de mens an' one for de ladies. Mis' Roby went down\r\nto dis house one day, an' when she opened de door, dare lay er Yankee\r\nsojer on de floor. His head wuz tied up wid er bloody rag an' he look\r\nlike he wuz dead.\r\n\r\nMammy say she seed Mis' Roby when she come out. She looked skeered but\r\nshe didn' scream nor nothin'. When she seed mammy she motioned to her.\r\nShe tole her 'bout de Yankee. 'He's jus' er boy, Hannah,' she say, 'he\r\nain't no older den Marse Gaston, an' he's hurt. We got to do somethin'\r\nan' we can't tell nobody.' Den she sen' mammy to de house for er pan of\r\nhot water, de scissors an' er ole sheet. Mis' Roby cut off de bloody ran\r\nan' wash dat sojer boy's head den she tied up de cut places. Den she\r\nwent to de house an' made mammy slip him er big milk toddy. 'Bout dat\r\ntime she seed some ho'seman comin' down de road. When dey got closer she\r\nseed dey wuz 'Federate sojers. Dey rode up in de yard an' Marse Billy\r\nwent out to meet dem. Dey tole him dat dey wuz lookin' for er Yankee\r\nprisoner dat done got away from dey camp.\r\n\r\nAfter Ole Marse tole dem dat he ain't seed no Yankee sojer, dey tole him\r\ndat dey got to search de place kaze dat wuz orders.\r\n\r\nWhen Mis Roby heard dem say dat she turned an' went through de house to\r\ndo back yard. She walk 'roun' 'mong de flowers, but all de time she\r\nwatchin' dem 'Federates search de barns, stables, an' everywhare. But,\r\nwhen dey start to de lilac bushes, Mis' Roby lif' her head an' walk\r\nright down de paf to de ladies back house, an' right befo' all dem mens,\r\nwid dem lookin' at her, she opened de door an' walk in. She sholy did.\r\n\r\nDat night when 'twuz dark Mis' Roby wrap' up er passel of food an' er\r\nbottle of brandy an' give it to dat sojer Yankee boy. She tole him dey\r\nwuz ho'ses in de paster an' dat de Yankee camp wuz over near Laurinburg\r\nor somewhare like dat.\r\n\r\nNobody ain't seed dat boy since, but somehow dat ho'se come back an' in\r\nhis mane wuz er piece of paper. Marse Billy foun' it an' brung it to\r\nMis' Roby an' ax her what it meant.\r\n\r\nMis' Roby took it an' 'twuz er letter dat sojer boy done wrote tellin'\r\nher dat he wuz safe an' thankin' her for what she done for him.\r\n\r\nMis' Roby tole Marse Billy she couldn' help savin' dat Yankee, he too\r\nmuch of er boy.\r\n\r\nMarse Billy he look at Mis' Roby, den he say: 'Roby, honey, yo's braver\r\nden any sojer I ever seed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

South Street\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know me every time you sees me don't you? Who tole you I wus Dorcas\r\nGriffith? I seed you up town de other day. Yes, yes, I is old. I is 80\r\nyears old. I remember all about dem Yankees. The first biscuit I ever et\r\ndey give it to me. I wus big enough to nus de babies when de Yankees\r\ncame through. Dey carried biscuits on dere horses, I wus jist thinkin'\r\nof my young missus de other day. I belonged to Doctor Clark in Chatham\r\nCounty near Pittsboro. My father wus named Billy Dismith, and my mother\r\nwus named Peggy Council. She belonged to the Councils. Father, belonged\r\nto the Dismiths and I belonged to the Clarks. Missus wus named Winnie.\r\nDey had tolerable fine food for de white folks, but I did not get any of\r\nit. De food dey give us wus mighty nigh nuthin'. Our clothes wus bad and\r\nour sleepin' places wus not nuthin' at all. We had a hard time. We had a\r\nhard time then and we are havin' a hard time now. We have a house to\r\nlive in now, and de chinches eat us up almos, and we have nuthin' to\r\nlive on now, jist a little from charity. I fares mighty bad. Dey gives\r\nme a half peck of meal and a pound o' meat, a little oat meal, and\r\ncanned grape juice, a half pound o' coffee and no sugar or lard and no\r\nflour. Dey gives us dat for a week's eatin'.\r\n\r\nDe Yankees called de niggers who wus plowin' de mules when dey came\r\nthrough an' made 'em bring 'em to 'em an' dey carried de mules on wid\r\nem. De niggers called de Yankees Blue Jackets.\r\n\r\nI had two brothers, both older dan me. George de oldest and Jack. Let\r\nme see I had four sisters 1, 2, 3, 4; one wus named Annie, one named\r\nRosa, Annie, and Francis and myself Dorcas. All de games I played wus de\r\nwurk in de field wid a hoe. Dere wus no playgrounds like we has now. No,\r\nno, if you got your work done you done enough. If I could see how to\r\nwrite like you I could do a lot o' work but I can't see. I kin write. I\r\ngot a good education acording to readin', spellin, and writin'. I kin\r\nsay de 2nd chapter of Matthey by heart, the 27 chapter of Ezelial by\r\nheart, or most of Ezekial by heart.\r\n\r\nI learned it since I got free. I went to school in Raleigh to de\r\nWashington School. Dey wouldn't let us have books when I wus a slave. I\r\nwus afraid ter be caught wid a book. De patterollers scared us so bad in\r\nslavery time and beat so many uv de slaves dat we lef' de plantation\r\njus' as soon as we wus free. Dat's de reason father lef' de plantation\r\nso quick. I also remember de Ku Klux. I wus afraid o' dem, and I did not\r\nthink much of 'em. I saw slaves whupped till de blood run down dere\r\nbacks. Once dey whupped some on de plantation and den put salt on de\r\nplaces and pepper on 'em. I didn't think nuthin in de world o' slavery.\r\nI think de it wus wrong. I didn't think a thing o' slavery.\r\n\r\nAll my people are dead, and I am unable to work. I haven't been able to\r\nwork in six years. I thought Abraham Lincoln wus a good man. He had a\r\ngood name.\r\n\r\nI don't know much about Mr. Roosevelt but I hopes he will help me,\r\ncause I need it mighty bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[TR: No Header Page]\r\n\r\nSARAH GUDGER                            [320005]\r\nEx-slave, 121 years\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigation of the almost incredible claim of Aunt Sarah Gudger,\r\nex-slave living in Asheville, that she was born on Sept. 15, 1816,\r\ndiscloses some factual information corroborating her statements.\r\n\r\nAunt Sarah's father, Smart Gudger, belonged to and took his family name\r\nfrom Joe Gudger, who lived near Oteen, about six miles east of Asheville\r\nin the Swannanoa valley, prior to the War Between the States. Family\r\nrecords show that Joe Gudger married a Miss McRae in 1817, and that\r\nwhile in a despondent mood he ended his own life by hanging, as vividly\r\nrecounted by the former slave.\r\n\r\nJohn Hemphill, member of the family served by Aunt Sarah until\r\n\"freedom,\" is recalled as being \"a few y'ars younge' as me,\" and indeed\r\nhis birth is recorded for 1822. Alexander Hemphill, mentioned by Aunt\r\nSarah as having left to join the Confederate army when about 25 years of\r\nage, is authentic and his approximate age in 1861 tallies with that\r\nrecalled by the ex-slave. When Alexander went off to the war Aunt Sarah\r\nwas \"gettin' t' be an ol' woman.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Sarah lives with distant cousins in a two-story frame house,\r\ncomfortably furnished, at 8 Dalton street in South Asheville (the Negro\r\nsection lying north of Kenilworth). A distant male relative, 72 years of\r\nage, said he has known Aunt Sarah all his life and that she was an old\r\nwoman when he was a small boy. Small in stature, about five feet tall,\r\nAunt Sarah is rathered rounded in face and body. Her milk-chocolate face\r\nis surmounted by short, sparse hair, almost milk white. She is somewhat\r\ndeaf but understands questions asked her, responding with animation. She\r\nwalks with one crutch, being lame in the right leg. On events of the\r\nlong ago her mind is quite clear. Recalling the Confederate \"sojers,\r\nmarchin', marchin'\" to the drums, she beat a tempo on the floor with her\r\ncrutch. As she described how the hands of slaves were tied before they\r\nwere whipped for infractions she crossed her wrists.\r\n\r\nOwen Gudger, Asheville postmaster (1913-21), member of the Buncombe\r\nCounty Historical Association, now engaged in the real estate business,\r\nsays he has been acquainted with Aunt Sarah all his life; that he has,\r\non several occasions, talked to her about her age and early\r\nassociations, and that her responses concerning members of the Gudger\r\nand Hemphill families coincide with known facts of the two families.\r\n\r\nInterviewed by a member of the Federal Writers' Project, Aunt Sarah\r\nseemed eager to talk, and needed but little prompting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSARAH GUDGER\r\n(born September 15, 1816)\r\nInterview with Mrs. Marjorie Jones, May 5, 1937\r\n\r\n\r\nI wah bo'n 'bout two mile fum Ole Fo't on de Ole Mo'ganton Road. I sho'\r\nhas had a ha'd life. Jes wok, an' wok, an' wok. I nebbah know nothin'\r\nbut wok. Mah boss he wah Ole Man Andy Hemphill. He had a la'ge\r\nplantation in de valley. Plenty ob ebbathin'. All kine ob stock: hawgs,\r\ncows, mules, an' hosses. When Marse Andy die I go lib wif he son,\r\nWilliam Hemphill.\r\n\r\nI nebbah fo'git when Marse Andy die. He wah a good ole man, and de\r\nMissie she wah good, too. She usta read de Bible t' us chillun afoah she\r\npass away.\r\n\r\nMah pappy, he lib wif Joe Gudgah (Gudger). He ole an' feeble, I\r\n'membahs. He 'pend on mah pappy t' see aftah ebbathin' foah him. He\r\nallus trust mah pappy. One mo'nin' he follah pappy to de field. Pappy he\r\nstop hes wok and ole Marse Joe, he say: \"Well, Smart (pappy, he name\r\nSmart), I's tard, wurried, an' trubble'. All dese yeahs I wok foah mah\r\nchillun. Dey nevah do de right thing. Dey wurries me, Smart. I tell yo',\r\nSmart, I's a good mind t' put mahself away. I's good mind t' drown\r\nmahself right heah. I tebble wurried, Smart.\"\r\n\r\nPappy he take hole Ole Marse Joe an' lead him t' de house. \"Now Marse\r\nJoe, I wudden talk sich talk effen I's yo'. Yo' ben good t' yo' fambly.\r\nJest yo' content yo'self an' rest.\"\r\n\r\nBut a few days aftah dat, Ole Marse Joe wah found ahangin' in de ba'n by\r\nde bridle. Ole Marse had put heself away.\r\n\r\nNo'm, I nebbah knowed whut it wah t' rest. I jes wok all de time f'om\r\nmawnin' till late at night. I had t' do ebbathin' dey wah t' do on de\r\noutside. Wok in de field, chop wood, hoe cawn, till sometime I feels lak\r\nmah back sholy break. I done ebbathin' 'cept split rails. Yo' know, dey\r\nsplit rails back in dem days. Well, I nevah did split no rails.\r\n\r\nOle Marse strop us good effen we did anythin' he didn' lak. Sometime he\r\nget hes dandah up an' den we dassent look roun' at him. Else he tie yo'\r\nhands afoah yo' body an' whup yo', jes lak yo' a mule. Lawdy, honey, I's\r\ntuk a thousand lashins in mah day. Sometimes mah poah ole body be soah\r\nfoah a week.\r\n\r\nOle Boss he send us niggahs out in any kine ob weathah, rain o' snow, it\r\nnebbah mattah. We had t' go t' de mountings, cut wood an' drag it down\r\nt' de house. Many de time we come in wif ouh cloes stuck t' ouh poah ole\r\ncold bodies, but 'twarn't no use t' try t' git 'em dry. Ef de Ole Boss\r\no' de Ole Missie see us dey yell: \"Git on out ob heah yo' black thin',\r\nan' git yo' wok outen de way!\" An' Lawdy, honey, we knowed t' git, else\r\nwe git de lash. Dey did'n cah how ole o' how young yo' wah, yo' nebbah\r\ntoo big t' git de lash.\r\n\r\nDe rich white folks nebbah did no wok; dey had da'kies t' do it foah\r\ndem. In de summah we had t' wok outdoo's, in de wintah in de house. I\r\nhad t' ceard an' spin till ten o'clock. Nebbah git much rest, had t' git\r\nup at foah de nex' mawnin' an' sta't agin. Didn' get much t' eat,\r\nnuthah, jes a lil' cawn bread an' 'lasses. Lawdy, honey, yo' caint know\r\nwhut a time I had. All cold n' hungry. No'm, I aint tellin' no lies. It\r\nde gospel truf. It sho is.\r\n\r\nI 'membah well how I use t' lie 'wake till all de folks wah sleepin',\r\nden creep outen de do' and walk barfoot in de snow, 'bout two mile t'\r\nmah ole Auntie's house. I knowed when I git dar she fix hot cawn pone\r\nwif slice o' meat an' some milk foah me t' eat. Auntie wah good t' us\r\nda'kies.\r\n\r\nI nebbah sleep on a bedstead till aftah freedom, no'm till [HW:\r\nasterisk] aftah freedom. Jes' an ole pile o' rags in de conah. Ha'dly\r\n'nuf t' keep us from freezin'. Law, chile, nobuddy knows how mean\r\nda'kies wah treated. Wy, dey wah bettah t' de animals den t' us'ns. Mah\r\nfust Ole Marse wah a good ole man, but de las'n, he wah rapid--- he sho\r\nwah rapid. Wy, chile, times aint no mo' lak dey usta be den de day an'\r\nnight am lak. In mah day an' time all de folks woked. Effen dey had no\r\nniggahs dey woked demselves. Effen de chillun wah too small tuh hoe, dey\r\npull weeds. Now de big bottom ob de Swannano (Swannanoa) dat usta grow\r\nhunners bushels ob grain am jest a playgroun'. I lak t' see de chillun\r\nin de field. Wy, now dey fight yo' lak wilecat effen it ebben talked\r\n'bout. Dat's de reason times so ha'd. No fahmin'. Wy, I c'n 'membah Ole\r\nMissie she say: \"Dis gene'ation'll pass away an' a new gene'ation'll cum\r\n'long.\" Dat's jes' it--ebbah gene'ation gits weakah an' weakah. Den dey\r\ntalk 'bout goin' back t' ole times. Dat time done gone, dey nebbah meet\r\ndat time agin.\r\n\r\nWahn't none o' de slaves offen ouh plantation ebbah sold, but de ones on\r\nde othah plantation ob Marse William wah. Oh, dat wah a tebble time! All\r\nde slaves be in de field, plowin', hoein', singin' in de boilin' sun.\r\nOle Marse he cum t'ru de field wif a man call de specalater. Day walk\r\nround jes' lookin', jes'lookin', All de da'kies know whut dis mean. Dey\r\ndidn' dare look up, jes' wok right on. Den de specalater he see who he\r\nwant. He talk to Ole Marse, den dey slaps de han'cuffs on him an' tak\r\nhim away to de cotton country. Oh, dem wah awful times! When de\r\nspecalater wah ready to go wif de slaves, effen dey wha enny whu didn'\r\nwanta go, he thrash em, den tie em 'hind de waggin an' mek em run till\r\ndey fall on de groun', den he thrash em till dey say dey go 'thout no\r\ntrubble. Sometime some of dem run 'way an cum back t' de plantation, den\r\nit wah hardah on dem den befoah. When de da'kies wen' t' dinnah de ole\r\nniggah mammy she say whar am sich an' sich. None ob de othahs wanna tell\r\nhuh. But when she see dem look down to de groun' she jes' say: \"De\r\nspecalater, de specalater.\" Den de teahs roll down huh cheeks, cause\r\nmebbe it huh son o' husban' an' she know she nebbah see 'em agin. Mebbe\r\ndey leaves babies t' home, mebbe jes' pappy an' mammy. Oh, mah Lawdy,\r\nmah ole Boss wah mean, but he nebbah sen' us to de cotton country.\r\n\r\nDey wah ve'y few skules back in day day an time, ve'y few. We da'kies\r\ndidn' dah look at no book, not ebben t' pick it up. Ole Missie, dat is,\r\nmah firs' Ole Missie, she wah a good ole woman. She read to de niggahs\r\nand t' de white chillun. She cum fum cross de watah. She wahn't lak de\r\nsma't white folks livin' heah now. When she come ovah heah she brung\r\ndarky boy wif huh. He wah huh pussonal su'vant. Co'se, dey got diffent\r\nnames foah dem now, but in dat day dey calls 'em ginney niggahs. She wah\r\ngood ole woman, not lak othah white folks. Niggahs lak Ole Missie.\r\n\r\nWhen de da'kies git sick, dey wah put in a lil' ole house close t' de\r\nbig house, an' one of the othah da'kies waited on 'em. Dey wah ve'y few\r\ndoctahs den. Ony three in de whole section. When dey wanted med'cine dey\r\nwent t' de woods an' gathahed hoahhound, slipperelm foah poltices an'\r\nall kinds ba'k foah teas. All dis yarbs bring yo' round. Dey wah ve'y\r\nfew lawyers den too, but lawsy me, yo' cain't turn round fer dem now.\r\n\r\nI 'membahs when mah ole mammy die. She live on Rims (Reems) Crick with\r\nothah Hemphills. She sick long time. One day white man cum t' see me. He\r\nsay: \"Sarah, did yo' know yo' manmy wah daid?\" \"No,\" I say, \"but I wants\r\nt' see mah mothah afoah dey puts huh away.\"\r\n\r\nI went t' de house and say t' Ole Missie: \"Mah mothah she die tofay. I\r\nwants t' see mah mothah afoah dey puts huh away,\" but she look at me\r\nmean an' say: \"Git on outen heah, an' git back to yo' wok afoah I wallup\r\nyo' good.\" So I went back t' mah wok, with the tears streamin' down mah\r\nface, jest awringin' mah hands, I wanted t' see mah manmy so. 'Bout two\r\nweeks latah, Ole Missie she git tebble sick, she jes' lingah 'long foah\r\nlong time, but she nebbah gits up no mo'.

Wa'nt long afoah dey took\r\nmah mammy away, and I wah lef' alone.\r\n\r\nOn de plantation wah an ole woman whut de boss bought f'om a drovah up\r\nin Virginny. De boss he bought huh f'om one ob de specalaters. She laff\r\nan' tell us: \"Some ob dese days yo'all gwine be free, jes' lak de white\r\nfolks,\" but we all laff at huh. No, we jes' slaves, we allus hafta wok\r\nand nevah be free. Den when freedom cum, she say: \"I tole yo'all, now\r\nyo' got no larnin', yo' got no nothin', got no home; whut yo' gwine do?\r\nDidn' I tell yo'?\"\r\n\r\nI wah gittin along smartly in yeahs when de wah cum. Ah 'membah jes' lak\r\nyestiddy jes' afoah de wah. Marse William wah atalkin' t' hes brothah. I\r\nwah standin' off a piece. Marse's brothah, he say: \"William, how ole\r\nAunt Sarah now?\" Marse William look at me an' he say: \"She gittin' nigh\r\nonta fifty.\" Dat wah jes' a lil while afoah de wah.\r\n\r\nDat wah awful time. Us da'kies didn' know whut it wah all bout. Ony one\r\nof de boys f'om de plantation go. He Alexander, he 'bout twenty-five\r\nden. Many de time we git word de Yankees comin'. We take ouh food an'\r\nstock an' hide it till we sho' dey's gone. We wan't bothahed much. One\r\nday, I nebbah fo'git, we look out an' see sojers ma'chin'; look lak de\r\nwhole valley full ob dem. I thought: \"Poah helpless crittahs, jes' goin'\r\naway t' git kilt.\" De drums wah beatin' an' de fifes aplayin'. Dey wah\r\nde foot comp'ny. Oh, glory, it wah a sight. Sometime dey cum home on\r\nfurlough. Sometime dey git kilt afoah dey gits th'ough. Alexander, he\r\ncum home a few time afoah freedom.\r\n\r\nWhen de wah was ovah, Marse William he say: \"Did yo'all know yo'all's\r\nfree, Yo' free now.\" I chuckle, 'membahin' whut ole woman tell us 'bout\r\nfreedom, an' no larnin. Lotta men want me t' go t' foreign land, but I\r\ntell 'em I go live wif mah pappy, long as he live.

Andrews\r\n\r\n[TR: Date Stamp \"SEP 10 1937\"]\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HALL\r\nAge 81 years\r\n316 Tarboro Road, Raleigh, N. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Thomas Hall and I was born in Orange County, N. C. on a\r\nplantation belonging to Jim Woods whose wife, our missus, was named\r\nPolly. I am eighty one years of age as I was born Feb. 14, 1856. My\r\nfather Daniel Hall and my mother Becke Hall and me all belonged to the\r\nsame man but it was often the case that this wus not true as one man,\r\nperhaps a Johnson, would own a husband and a Smith own the wife, each\r\nslave goin' by the name of the slave owners, family. In such cases the\r\nchildren went by the name of the family to which the mother belonged.\r\n\r\nGettin married an' having a family was a joke in the days of slavery,\r\nas the main thing in allowing any form of matrimony among the slaves was\r\nto raise more slaves in the same sense and for the same purpose as stock\r\nraisers raise horses and mules, that is for work. A woman who could\r\nproduce fast was in great demand and brought a good price on the auction\r\nblock in Richmond, Va., Charleston, S. C., and other places.\r\n\r\nThe food in many cases that was given the slaves was not given them for\r\ntheir pleasure or by a cheerful giver, but for the simple and practical\r\nreason that children would not grow into a large healthy slave unless\r\nthey were well fed and clothed; and given good warm places in which to\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nConditions and rules were bad and the punishments were severe and\r\nbarbarous. Some marsters acted like savages. In some instances slaves\r\nwere burned at the stake. Families were torn apart by selling. Mothers\r\nwere sold from their children. Children were sold from their mothers,\r\nand the father was not considered in anyway as a family part. These\r\nconditions were here before the Civil War and the conditions in a\r\nchanged sense have been here ever since. The whites have always held the\r\nslaves in part slavery and are still practicing the same things on them\r\nin a different manner. Whites lynch, burn, and persecute the Negro race\r\nin America yet; and there is little they are doing to help them in\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\nLincoln got the praise for freeing us, but did he do it? He give us\r\nfreedom without giving us any chance to live to ourselves and we still\r\nhad to depend on the southern white man for work, food and clothing, and\r\nhe held us through our necessity and want in a state of servitude but\r\nlittle better than slavery. Lincoln done but little for the Negro race\r\nand from living standpoint nothing. White folks are not going to do\r\nnothing for Negroes except keep them down.\r\n\r\nHarriet Beecher Stowe, the writer of Uncle Tom's Cabin, did that for\r\nher own good. She had her own interests at heart and I don't like her,\r\nLincoln, or none of the crowd. The Yankees helped free us, so they say,\r\nbut they let us be put back in slavery again.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of slavery it makes me mad. I do not believe in giving you\r\nmy story 'cause with all the promises that have been made the Negro is\r\nstill in a bad way in the United States, no matter in what part he\r\nlives it's all the same. Now you may be all right; there are a few white\r\nmen who are but the pressure is such from your white friends that you\r\nwill be compelled to talk against us and give us the cold shoulder when\r\nyou are around them, even if your heart is right towards us.\r\n\r\nYou are going around to get a story of slavery conditions and the\r\npersecusions of Negroes before the civil war and the economic conditions\r\nconcerning them since that war. You should have known before this late\r\nday all about that. Are you going to help us? No! you are only helping\r\nyourself. You say that my story may be put into a book, that you are\r\nfrom the Federal Writer's Project. Well, the Negro will not get anything\r\nout of it, no matter where you are from. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote\r\nUncle Tom's Cabin. I didn't like her book and I hate her. No matter\r\nwhere you are from I don't want you to write my story cause the white\r\nfolks have been and are now and always will be against the negro.\r\n\r\nLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

One los' his fight, but\r\nde other won his.\r\n\r\nOne of dese Generals wuz a white man dat rode a white hoss, an' de other\r\nwuz a mean fightin' gander dat I named General Lee, though I didn' know\r\nden dat he wuz goin' to live up to his name. But when de time come dat\r\nlong neck gander out fit de whole 'Federate army.\r\n\r\nMy white fo'ks lived in Virginia. Dey wuz Marse Peter an' Mis' Laura\r\nHamilton. Dey lived on de big Hamilton plantation dat wuz so big dat wid\r\nall de niggers dey had dey couldn' 'ten' half of it. Dis lan' done been\r\nhanded down to Marse Peter from more den six gran'pappys. Dey wuz cotton\r\nan' 'bacca fields a mile wide; de wheat fields as far as yo' could see\r\nwuz like a big sheet of green water, an' it took half hour to plow one\r\nrow of cawn, but dey wuz plenty of slaves to do de work. Mistah Sidney\r\nEffort, Marse Peter's overseer, rode all over de fields every day,\r\ncussin' an' crackin' his long blacksnake whip. He drove dem niggers like\r\ndey wuz cattle, but Marse Peter wouldn' 'low no beatin' of his niggers.\r\n\r\nMarse Peter had acres an' acres of woods dat wuz his huntin' 'zerve. Dey\r\nwuz every kind of bird an' animal in dem woods in shootin' season. Dey\r\nwuz snipes, pheasants, patridges, squirrels, rabbits, deers, an' foxes;\r\ndey wuz even bears, an' dey wuz wolfs too dat would come an' catch de\r\nsheeps at night.\r\n\r\nDey wuz always a crowd at Easy Acres huntin' ridin' dancin' an' havin' a\r\ngood time. Marse Peter's stables wuz full of hunters an' saddlers for\r\nmens an' ladies. De ladies in dem days rode side saddles. Mis' Laura's\r\nsaddle wuz all studded wid sho nuff gol' tacks. De fringe wuz tipped wid\r\ngol', an' de buckles on de bridle wuz solid gol'. When de ladies went to\r\nride dey wore long skirts of red, blue, an' green velvet, an' dey had\r\nplumes on dey hats dat blew in de win'. Dey wouldn' be caught wearin'\r\nbritches an' ridin' straddle like de womens do dese days. In dem times\r\nde women wuz ladies.\r\n\r\nMarse Peter kept de bes' sideboa'd in Princess Anne County. His cut\r\nglass decanters cos' near 'bout as much as Mis' Laura's diamon' ear\r\nrings I's goin' tell yo' 'bout. De decanters wuz all set out on de\r\nsideboard wid de glasses, an' de wine an' brandy wuz so ole dat one good\r\nsize dram would make yo' willin' to go to de jail house for sixty days.\r\nSome of dat wine an' likker done been in dat cellar ever since Ole Marse\r\nCaleb Hamilton's time, an' de done built Easy Acres befo' Mistah George\r\nWashington done cut down his pappy's cherry tree. Dat likker done been\r\ndown in dat cellar so long dat yo' had to scrape de dus' off wid a\r\nknife.\r\n\r\nI wuz Marse Peter's main sideboa'd man. When he had shootin' company I\r\ndidn' do nothin' but shake drams. De mens would come in from de huntin'\r\nfield col' an' tired, an' Marse Peter would say: 'Hustle up, Hecter, fix\r\nus a dram of so an' so.' Dat mean dat I wuz to mix de special dram dat\r\nI done learned from my gran'pappy. So, I pours in a little of dis an' a\r\nlittle of dat, den I shakes it 'twell it foams, den I fills de glasses\r\nan' draps in de ice an' de mint. Time de mens drink dat so an' so dey\r\ndone forgot dey's tired; dey 'lax, an' when de ladies come down de\r\nstairs all dredd up, dey thinks dey's angels walkin' in gol' shoes. Dem\r\nwuz good times befo' de war an' befo' Marse Peter got shot. From de day\r\nMarse Peter rode his big grey hoss off to fight, we never seed him no\r\nmore. Mis' Laura never even know if dey buried him or not.\r\n\r\nAfter de mens all went to de war dey won't no use for no more drams, so\r\nMis' Laura took me away from de sideboa'd an' made me a watchman. Dat\r\nis, I wuz set to watch de commissary to see dat de niggers wuzn' give no\r\nmore den dey share of eats, den I looked after de chickens an' things,\r\nkaze de patter-rollers wuz all 'roun' de country an' dey'd steal\r\neverythin' from chickens to sweet taters an cawn, den dey'd sell it to\r\nde Yankees. Dat's when I named dat ole mean fightin' gander General Lee.\r\n\r\nEverywhare I went 'roun' de place dat gander wuz right at my heels. He\r\nwuz de bigges' gander I ever seed. He weighed near 'bout forty pounds,\r\nan' his wings from tip to tip wuz 'bout two yards. He wuz smart too. I\r\nteached him to drive de cows an' sheeps, an' I sic'd him on de dogs when\r\ndey got 'streperous. I'd say, Sic him, General Lee, an' dat gander would\r\ncha'ge. He wuz a better fighter den de dogs kaze he fit wid his wings,\r\nhis bill, an wid his feets. I seed him skeer a bull near 'bout to death\r\none day. Dat bull got mad an' jump de fence an' run all de niggers in\r\nde cabins, so I called General Lee an' sic'd him on dat bull. Dat bird\r\ngive one squawk an' lit on dat bull's back, an' yo' never seed such\r\ncarryin's on. De bull reared an' snorted an' kicked, but dat gander held\r\non. He whipped dat bull wid his wings 'twell he wuz glad to go back in\r\nde lot an' 'have hese'f. After dat all I had to do to dat bull wuz show\r\nhim General Lee an' he'd quiet down.\r\n\r\nNow I's goin' to tell yo' 'bout Mis' Laura's diamon' ear rings.\r\n\r\nDe fus' Yankees dat come to de house wuz gentlemens, 'cept dey made us\r\nniggers cook dey supper an' shine dey muddy boots, den dey stole\r\neverythin' dey foun' to tote away, but de nex ones dat come wuz mean.\r\nDey got made kaze de fus' Yankees done got de pickin's of what Mis'\r\nLaura hadn' hid. Dey cut open de feather beds lookin' for silver; dey\r\nripped open de chair cushings lookin' for money, dey even tore up de\r\ncarpets, but dey didn' fin' nothin' kaze all de valuables done been\r\nburied. Even mos' of de wine done been hid, 'twuz' all buried in de ole\r\ngraves down in de family grave yard wid de tombstones at de head an'\r\nfoots. No Yankee ain't goin' be diggin' in no grave for nothin'.\r\n\r\nDey wuz one Yankee in dis las' bunch dat wuz big an' bustin'. He strut\r\nbigoty wid his chist stuck out. He walk 'roun' stickin' his sword in de\r\nchair cushions, de pictures on de walls an' things like dat. He got\r\npowerful mad kaze he couldn' fin' nothin', den he look out de window an'\r\nseed Mis' Laura. She wuz standin' on de po'ch an' de sun wuz shinin' on\r\nde diamon' ear rings in her ears. Dey wuz de ear rings dat belonged to\r\nMarse Peter's great-great-gran'mammy. When de sojer seed dem diamon's\r\nhis eyes 'gun to shine. He went out on de po'ch an' went up to Mis'\r\nLaura. 'Gim me dem ear rings,' he say jus' like dat.\r\n\r\nMis' Laura flung her han's up to her ears an' run out in de yard. De\r\nsojer followed her, an' all de other sojers come too. Dat big Yankee\r\ntole Mis' Laura again to give him de ear rings, but she shook her head.\r\nI wuz standin' 'side de house near 'bout bustin' wid madness when dat\r\nYankee reach up an' snatch Mis' Laura's hands down an' hold dem in his,\r\nden he laugh, an' all de other sojers 'gun to laugh too jus' like dey\r\nthought 'twuz funny. 'Bout dat time Ole General Lee done smell a fight.\r\nHe come waddlin' 'roun' de house, his tail feathers bristled out an'\r\ntawkin' to he'sef. I point to dem sojers an say, \"Sic him, General Lee,\r\nsic him.\"\r\n\r\nDat gander ain't waste no time. He let out his wings an' cha'ged dem\r\nYankees an' dey scatter like flies. Den he lit on dat big sojer's back\r\nan' 'gun to beat him wid his wings. Dat man let out a yell an' drap Mis'\r\nLaura's hands; he try to shake dat goose, but General bit into his neck\r\nan' held on like a leech. When de other sojers come up an' try to pull\r\nhim off, dat gander let out a wing an' near about slap dem down. I ain't\r\nnever seed such fightin! Every time I holler, Sic him, General Lee start\r\n'nother 'tack.\r\n\r\n'Bout dat time dem Yankees took a runnin' nothin. Dey forgot de ear\r\nrings an' lit out down de road, but dat gander beat dat bigoty yellin'\r\nsojer clear down to de branch befo' he turned him loose, den he jump in\r\nde water an' wash hese'f off. Yes, suh, dat wuz sho some fightin' goose;\r\nhe near 'bout out fit de sho nuff Marse General Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District: No. 2                   [320230]\r\nWorker:         T.

Don't want no more bad luck den what\r\nI'se already got. My name is George Harris. I wuz born November 25, 82\r\nyears ago. I have been living in the City of Raleigh onto 52 years. I\r\nbelonged to John Andrews. He died about de time I wuz born. His wife\r\nBetsy wuz my missus and his son John wuz my marster.\r\n\r\nDeir plantation wuz in Jones County. Dere were about er dozen slaves on\r\nde plantation. We had plenty o' food in slavery days during my boyhood\r\ndays, plenty of good sound food. We didn't have 'xactly plenty o'\r\nclothes, and our places ter sleep needed things, we were in need often\r\nin these things. We were treated kindly, and no one abused us. We had as\r\ngood owners as there were in Jones County; they looked out for us. They\r\nlet us have patches to tend and gave us what we made. We did not have\r\nmuch money. We had no church on the plantation, but there wuz one on\r\nMarster's brother's plantation next ter his plantation.\r\n\r\nWe had suppers an' socials, generally gatherings for eatin', socials\r\njist to git together an' eat. We had a lot o' game ter eat, such as\r\npossums, coons, rabbits and birds.\r\n\r\nDe plantation wuz fenced in wid rails about 10 ft. in length split from\r\npine trees. De cattle, hogs an' hosses run out on de free range. The\r\nhosses ran on free range when de crap wuz laid by. There wuz an ole mare\r\ndat led de hosses. She led 'em an' when she come home at night dey\r\nfollowed her.\r\n\r\nDe first work I done wuz drappin' tater sprouts, drappin' corn, thinnin'\r\nout corn and roundin' up corn an' mindin' the crows out of de field. Dey\r\ndid not teach us to read an' write, but my father could read, and he\r\nread de hymn book and Testament to us sometimes. I do not remember ever\r\ngoin' to church durin' slavery days.\r\n\r\nI have never seen a slave whipped and none ever ran away to the North\r\nfrom our plantation.\r\n\r\nWhen I wuz a boy we chillun played marbles, prison base, blind fold and\r\ntag, hide an' seek. Dey gave us Christmas holidays, an' 4th of July, an'\r\nlay-by time. Dey also called dis time \"crap hillin' time.\" Most o' de\r\ntime when we got sick our mother doctored us with herbs which she had in\r\nde garden. When we had side plurisy, what dey calls pneumonia now, dey\r\nsent fer a doctor. Doctor Hines treated us.\r\n\r\nWe lived near Trenton. When de Yankees took New Bern, our marster had us\r\nout in de woods in Jones County mindin' hosses an' takin' care o' things\r\nhe had hid there. We got afraid and ran away to New Bern in Craven\r\nCounty. We all went in a gang and walked. De Yankees took us at Deep\r\nGully ten miles dis side o' New Bern an' carried us inside de lines. Dey\r\nasked us questions and put us all in jail. Dey put my father ter cookin'\r\nat de jail and give us boys work 'roun' de yard. Dey put de others at\r\nwork at de horse stables and houses.\r\n\r\nDe smallpox and yaller fever caught us dere and killed us by de\r\nhundreds. Thirteen doctors died dere in one day. Jist 'fore Gen. Lee\r\nsurrendered dey carried us to Petersburg, Va., and I waited on Major\r\nEmory and de others worked fer de Yankees. When de surrender came we\r\nwent back home to Craven County, next to Jones County, and went to\r\nfarmin'. Sumpin' to eat could not hardly be found. De second year atter\r\nde war we went back to old marster's plantation. He wuz glad ter see us,\r\nwe all et dinner wid him. We looked over de place. I looked over de\r\nlittle log cabin where I wuz born. Some of de boys who had been slaves,\r\nfarmed wid old marster, but I worked at my trade. I wuz a brick moulder.\r\nYes, a brick maker.\r\n\r\nMy mother was named Jennie Andrews and my father was Quash Harris. My\r\nfather belonged to de Harris family on de nex' plantation in Jones\r\nCounty. Atter de surrender we all went in his name. We changed from\r\nAndrews to Harris. I do not recollect my grandmother and grandfather. I\r\ncan't recollect them.\r\n\r\nMarster told us directly after dey declared war dat he expected we would\r\nall soon be free. De majority of de slaves did not want to be free. Dey\r\nwere stirred up. Dey didn't want it to be. Dey didn't want no fightin'.\r\nDey didn't know.\r\n\r\nI married Mary Boylan first, of Johnston County, at Wilsons Mills, Jan.\r\n4, 1878. Here is de family record. Ole marster made me copies after de\r\nwar, and I copied dis. 'George Harris was married the year 1878, January\r\nthe 4th. George Harris was born the year 1855 November the 25th.'\r\n\r\nI had five brothers, but they are all dead, fur as I know: John Nathan,\r\nLouis, David, Jefferson, Donald and my name George. My sisters, Mary\r\nAnn, Sara, Lucy, Penny, Emaline, Lizzie, Nancy, Leah and one I can't\r\nremember. Dats all.\r\n\r\nI thought Abraham Lincoln wuz a great man. I remember him well. I think\r\nhe done de best he knowed how to settle de country. Mr. Roosevelt is a\r\nsmart man. He is doing de best he can. I think he is goin' to help de\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

I wuz not afraid of 'em, I thought dey\r\nwere the prettiest blue mens I had ever seed. I can see how de chickens\r\nand guineas flew and run from 'em. De Yankees killed 'em and give part\r\nof 'em to the colored folks. Most of de white folks had run off and hid.\r\n\r\nI can't read and write. I nebber had no chance.\r\n\r\nDe Yankees had their camps along the Fayetteville road.\r\n\r\nDey called us Dinah, Sam, and other names.\r\n\r\nDey later had de place dey call de bureau. When we left de white folks\r\nwe had nothing to eat. De niggers wait there at de bureau and they give\r\n'em hard tack, white potatoes, and saltpeter meat. Our white folks give\r\nus good things to eat, and I cried every day at 12 o'clock to go home.\r\nYes, I wanted to go back to my white folks; they were good to us. I\r\nwould say, 'papa le's go home, I want to go home. I don't like this\r\nsumptin' to eat.' He would say, 'Don't cry, honey, le's stay here, dey\r\nwill sen' you to school.'\r\n\r\nWe had nothing to eat 'cept what de Yankees give us. But Mr. Bill\r\nCrawford give my father and mother work. Yes, he wuz a Southern man, one\r\no' our white folks. Daddy wuz his butcher. My mother wuz his cook. We\r\nwere turned out when dey freed us with no homes and nuthin'. Master said\r\nhe wuz sorry he didn't give us niggers part of his lan'.\r\n\r\nWhile I wuz big enough to work I worked for Porter Steadman. I got 25\r\ncent a week and board. We had a good home then. I just shouted when I\r\ngot dat 25 cent, and I just run. I couldn't run fas' anuff to git to my\r\nmother to give dat money to her. My father died, and my mother bought a\r\nhome. She got her first money to buy de home by working for de man who\r\ngive her work after de surrender. The first money she saved to put on de\r\nhome wuz a dime. Some weeks she only saved 5 cents. Lan' sold fur $10 a\r\nacre den.\r\n\r\nJust after de war de white and colored children played together. Dey had\r\na tent in our neighborhood. I wuz de cook for de white chilluns parties.\r\nWe played together fer a long time after de war.\r\n\r\nI married Silas Cooper of Norfolk Va. He worked in the Navy yard. I wuz\r\nmarried in Raleigh. I had a church wedding.\r\n\r\nI think Abraham Lincoln wuz a great man. He would cure or kill. But I\r\nlike my ole master. The Lord put it into Abraham Lincoln to do as he\r\ndone. The Lord knowed he would be killed.\r\n\r\nI think slavery wuz wrong. I have a horror of being a slave. You see all\r\ndis lan' aroun' here. It belongs to colored folks. Dey were cut off wid\r\nnothin', but dey is strugglin' an' dey are comin' on fast. De Bible say\r\ndat de bottom rail will be on top, and it is comin' to pass. Sometime de\r\ncolored race will git up. De Bible say so.\r\n\r\nI think Mr. Roosevelt is one of the greatest mans in de world. He wants\r\nto help everybody.\r\n\r\nI doan think much of Mr. Jeff Davis. Dey used to sing songs uv hanging\r\nhim to a apple tree.

When I got\r\nbigger I helped den wid de thrashin' de wheat an' I helped dem push de\r\nstraw to de stack.\r\n\r\nWe had what wuz den called a 'groun' hog. It wuz a cylinder shaped\r\ncontraption. We put de wheat straw an all in it an' knock de grain loose\r\nfrom de straw. Den we took de pitchforks an' tossed de straw up an'\r\nabout, an' dat let de wheat go to de bottom on a big cloth. Den we fan\r\nde wheat, to get de dust an' dirt out, an' we had big curtains hung\r\n'roun' de cloth whar de wheat lay, so de wheat wouldn' get all\r\nscattered, on de groun'. Dis wheat was sacked an' when wanted 'twus took\r\nto de mill an' groun' into flour. De flour wuz made into white bread an'\r\nde corn wuz groun' into meal an' grits.\r\n\r\nWhen de war started der wuz some bad times. One day some of Wheeler's\r\nmen come an' dey tried to take what dey wanted, but Marge Paul had de\r\nsilver money another things hid. Dey wanted us niggers to tell dem whar\r\neverythin' wuz, but we said we didn' know nuthin'. Marse Paul wuz hid\r\nin de woods wid de horses an' some of de other stock.\r\n\r\nDen Wheeler's men saw de Yankees comin' an' dey run away. De Yankees\r\nchased dem to de bridge an' dey done some fightin' an' one or two of\r\nWheeler's men wuz killed an' de rest got away.\r\n\r\nDen de captain of de Yankees come to Mammy's cabin an' axed her whar de\r\nmeat house an' flour an' sech at. She tole him dat Pappy had de keys to\r\ngo an' ax him. \"Ax him nothin'\", de captain said. He called some of his\r\nmens an' dey broke down de door to de meat house. Den dey trowed out\r\nplenty of dose hams an' dey tole Mammy to cook dem somethin' to eat and\r\nplenty of it. Mammy fried plenty of dat ham an' made lots of bread an'\r\nfixed dem coffee. How dey did eat! Dey wuz jus' as nice as dey could be\r\nto Mammy an' when dey wuz through, dey tole Mammy dat she could have de\r\nrest, an' de captain gave her some money an' he tole her dat she wuz\r\nfree, dat we didn' belong to Marse Paul no longer. Dey didn' do any harm\r\nto de place. Dey wuz jus' looking for somethin' to eat. Den dey left.\r\n\r\nWe didn' leave Marse Paul but stayed on an' lived wid him for many\r\nyears. I lived wid Marse Paul 'til he died an' he done selected eight of\r\nus niggers to tote his coffin to de chapel, an' de buryin' groun'. He\r\nsaid, \"I want dese niggers to carry my body to de chapel an' de grave\r\nwhen I die.\" We did. It wuz a lood [HW correction: load] I would have\r\nbeen glad had der been two or four more to help tote Marse Paul for he\r\nsho wuz heavy. After everythin' wuz ready we lifted him up an' toted him\r\nto de chapel an' we sat down on de floor, on each side of de coffin,\r\nwhile de preacher preached de funeral sermon. We didn' make any fuss\r\nwhile sittin' dere on de floor, but we sho wuz full of grief to see our\r\ndear ole Marse Paul lying dere dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

Pool. Mr. Pool liked father because he was quick and obedient\r\nso he determined to give him a trade.\r\n\r\nWilson Morgan run the blacksmith shop at Falls of Neuse and it was him\r\nthat taught my father the trade at Mr. Pool's insistence.\r\n\r\nWhile father, a young blade, worked and lived at Falls of Neuse, he fell\r\nin love with my mother, Mirana Denson, who lived in Raleigh. He come to\r\nsee her ever' chance he got and then they were married.\r\n\r\nWhen the Yankees were crossing the Neuse Bridge at the falls, near the\r\nold paper mill, the bridge broke in. They were carrying the heavy\r\nartillery over and a great many men followed, in fact the line extended\r\nto Raleigh, because when the bridge fell word passed by word of mouth\r\nfrom man to man back to Raleigh.\r\n\r\nFather said that the Yankees stopped in the shop to make some hoss\r\nshoes and nails and that the Yankees could do it faster than anybody he\r\never saw.\r\n\r\nFather told me a story once 'bout de devil traveling and he got sore\r\nfeet and was awful lame but he went in a blacksmith shop and the\r\nblacksmith shoed him.\r\n\r\nThe devil traveled longer and the shoes hurt his feet and made him lamer\r\nthan ever so he went back and asked the blacksmith to take off de shoes.\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith took them off under the condition that wherever the devil\r\nsaw a horse shoe over a door he would not enter. That's the reason that\r\npeople hang up horseshoes over their door.\r\n\r\nMother died near twenty years ago and father died four years later. He\r\nhad not cared to live since mother left him.\r\n\r\nI've heard some of the young people laugh about slave love, but they\r\nshould envy the love which kept mother and father so close together in\r\nlife and even held them in death.\r\n\r\nLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

I wus a little girl, cryin' an' bawlin' an' Frank, who wus a big\r\nboy said dat he neber wanted ter spank a youngin' so bad, an' I ain't\r\nliked him no better dan he did me.\r\n\r\nHe 'longed ter Mr. Yarborough, what runned de hotel in Raleigh, but he\r\nwus boun' out ter anybody what'ud hire him, an' I doan know whar he got\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nI seed Frank a few times at de Holland's Methodist Church whar we went\r\nter church wid our white folks.\r\n\r\nYou axes iffen our white folks wus good ter us, an' I sez ter yo' dat\r\nnone of de white folks wus good ter none of de niggers. We done our\r\nweavin' at night an' we wurked hard. We had enough ter eat but we was\r\nwhupped some.\r\n\r\nJest 'fore de war wus ober we wus sent ter Mr. William Turner's place\r\ndown clost ter Smithfield an' dats whar we wus when de Yankees come.\r\n\r\nOne day I wus settin' on de porch restin' atter my days wurk wus done\r\nwhen I sees de hoss-lot full of men an' I sez ter Marse William, who am\r\ntalkin' ter a soldier named Cole, 'De lot am full of men.'\r\n\r\nMarse Cole looks up an' he 'lows, 'Hits dem damned Yankees,' an' wid dat\r\nhe buckles on his sword an' he ain't been seen since.\r\n\r\nDe Yankees takes all de meat outen de smokehouse an' goes 'roun' ter de\r\nslave cabins an' takes de meat what de white folkses has put dar. Dat\r\nwus de fust hams dat has eber been in de nigger house. Anyhow de Yankees\r\ntakes all de hams, but dey gibes us de shoulders.\r\n\r\nAtter de war we moved ter Raleigh, on Davie Street an' I went ter school\r\na little at Saint Paul's. Frank wus wurkin' at de City Market on\r\nFayetteville Street an' I'd go seberal blocks out of my way mornin' an'\r\nnight on my way ter school ter look at him. You see I has been in love\r\nwith him fer a long time den.\r\n\r\nAtter awhile Frank becomes a butcher an' he am makin' pretty good. I is\r\nthirteen so he comes ter see me an' fer a year we cou'ts.

I had three atter her, an' Frank wus\r\nproud of dem as could be. We wus happy. We libed together fifty-four\r\nyears an' we wus always happy, havin' a mighty little bit of argument.

My gran'-daughter can tell you what\r\nyear it was I was born I don' 'member but we has it down in the Bible.\r\n\r\nI lived near the \"Clock Church\" (Jewish Synagogue)[8], 4th and Market.\r\nWe had a big place there. My gran'mother did the cookin'. My mother did\r\nthe sewin'. I was jus five years old when the men went away. I guess to\r\nthe war, I don' know. Some men came by and conscip' dem. I don' know\r\nwhere they went but I guess dey went to war. I was such a little girl I\r\ndon't 'member much. But I does know my Missus was good to me. I used to\r\nplay with her little boy. I was jes' one of the family. I played with\r\nthe little boy around the house' cause I was never 'lowed to run the\r\nstreets. They was good to me. They kept me in clothes, pretty clothes,\r\nand good things to eat. Yes'm we was slaves but we had good times.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: \"What did you eat?\"\r\n\r\nIsabell: \"Oh I don't 'member 'special but I et jes what the family et.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe my father was killed in the war maybe he run away I don' know, he\r\njus' neber come back no mo'.\r\n\r\nYes'm I remember when the soldiers came along and freed us. They went\r\nthrough breakin' down peoples shops and everything.\r\n\r\nMy mother married again. She married Edward Robertson. He was good to\r\nme. Yes'm he was better to me than my father was. He was a preacher and\r\na painter. My mother died. When my father, (step-father) went off to\r\npreach, me and my sister stayed in the house.\r\n\r\nI stayed home all my life. I just wasn't 'llowed to run around like most\r\ngirls. I never been out of Wilmington but one year in my life. That year\r\nI went to Augusta. No'm I don't likes to go away. I don't like the\r\ntrains, nor the automobiles. But I rides in 'em (meaning the latter).\r\n\r\nI remember when the 4th Street bridge was built. I was married over\r\nthere in St. Stephen's Church, 5th and Red Cross. Yes M'am my auntie she\r\ngib me a big weddin'. I was 22 and my husband was 22 too not quite 23.\r\nNot a year older than I was. He was a cooper. Yes Ma'm I had a big\r\nweddin'. The church was all decorated with flowers. I had six\r\nattendants. Four big ones and two little ones. My husband he had the\r\nsame number I did four big ones and two little ones. I had on a white\r\ndress. Carried flowers. Had carriages and everything. My husband was\r\ngood to me. I didn't stay home with my father but about a month. We\r\nwanted to go to ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe went in our own home and stayed there until I got a \"sickness.\" (She\r\nlooked shy) I didn't know what was the matter with me. My father told me\r\nI better come home. So I went home to my father and stayed there about\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\nI have had five children. Three are livin'. Two are dead.\r\n\r\nI never worked until after he died. He left me with five little children\r\nto raise.\r\n\r\nHe was the only man I ever 'knowed' in all my life from girlhood up.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The Synagogue has no clock on the exterior, but Isabell\r\npersisted with her name of \"Clock Church.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

East Street, Raleigh, N. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wus borned five miles north of Raleigh on de Wendell Road, 83 years\r\nago. My mammy wus Nancy an' my pappy wus Louis. I had one sister, Mary,\r\nan' one bruder, Louis.\r\n\r\nWe 'longed ter Mr. Jake Mordecai, an' we lived on his six hundert acres\r\nplantation 'bout a mile from Millbrook. Right atter de war he sold dis\r\nlan' ter Doctor Miller an' bought de Betsy Hinton tract at Milburnie.\r\nMr. Jake had four or five hundert niggers hyar an' I doan know how many\r\nat de Edgecombe County place.\r\n\r\nDe wuck wus hard den, I knows case I'se seed my little mammy dig ditches\r\nwid de best of 'em. I'se seed her split 350 rails a day many's de time.\r\nDat wus her po'tion you knows, an' de mens had ter split 500. I wus too\r\nlittle ter do much but min' de chickens outen de gyarden, an' so I fared\r\nbetter dan most of 'em. You see Miss Tempie 'ud see me out at de gate\r\nmornin's as dey wus eatin' breakfas' on de ferander, an' she'ud call me\r\nter her an' give me butter toasted lightbread or biscuits. She'd give me\r\na heap in dat way, an' do de rest of de slaves got hungry, I doan think\r\ndat I eber did. I know dat Miss Jenny Perry, on a neighborin'\r\nplantation, 'ud give my mammy food, fer us chilluns.\r\n\r\nMo'nin's we sometimes ain't had nothin' ter eat. At dinner time de cook\r\nat de big house cooked nuff turnip salet, beans, 'taters, er peas fer\r\nall de han's an' long wid a little piece of meat an' a little hunk of\r\nco'nbread de dinner wus sont ter de slaves out in de fiel' on a cart.\r\n\r\nDe slaves 'ud set roun' under de trees an' eat an' laugh an' talk till\r\nde oberseer, Bob Gravie, yells at 'em ter git back ter wuck. Iffen dey\r\ndoan git back right den he starts ter frailin' lef' an' right.\r\n\r\nDar wus a few spirited slaves what won't be whupped an' my uncle wus\r\none. He wus finally sold fer dis.\r\n\r\nHit wus different wid my gran'mother do'. De oberseer tried ter whup her\r\nan' he can't, so he hollers fer Mr. Jake. Mr. Jake comes an' he can't,\r\nso he hauls off an' kicks granny, mashin' her stomick in. He has her\r\ncarried ter her cabin an' three days atterward she dies wid nothin' done\r\nfer her an' nobody wid her.\r\n\r\nMr. Jake orders de coffinmaker ter make de pine box, an' den he fergits\r\nhit. De slaves puts de coffin on de cyart hin' de two black hosses an'\r\nwid six or maybe seben hundert niggers follerin' dey goes ter de Simms'\r\ngraveyard an' buries her. All de way ter de graveyard dey sings, 'Swing\r\nLow Sweet Chariot,' 'De Promised Lan', 'De Road ter Jordan,' an' 'Ole\r\nTime Religion.'\r\n\r\nHit's a good thing dat none of de white folkses ain't went to de\r\nfunerals case iffen dey had de niggers can't sing deir hymns. Does you\r\nknow dat dey warn't no 'ligion 'lowed on dat plantation. Ole lady Betsy\r\nHolmes wus whupped time an' ag'in fer talkin' 'ligion er fer singin'\r\nhymns. We sometimes had prayermeetin' anyhow in de cabins but we'd turn\r\ndown de big pot front o' de door ter ketch de noise.\r\n\r\nDey won't gib us no pass hardly, an' iffen we runs 'way de patterollers\r\nwill git us. Dey did let us have some dances do' now an' den, but not\r\noffen. Dey let us go possum huntin' too case dat wus gittin' something\r\nter eat widout Mr. Jake payin' fer hit.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry, Mr. Jake's bruder an' his Uncle Moses uster come a-visitin'\r\nter de house fer de day. Mr. Henry wus little wid a short leg an' a long\r\none, an' he had de wust temper dat eber wus in de worl'; an' he loved\r\nter see slaves suffer, near 'bout much as he loved his brandy. We knowed\r\nwhen we seed him comin' dat dar wus gwine ter be a whuppin' frolic 'fore\r\nde day wus gone.\r\n\r\nDar wus three niggers, John Lane, Ananias Ruffin an' Dick Rogers what\r\ngot de blame fer eber'thing what happens on de place. Fer instance Mr.\r\nHenry 'ud look in de hawg pen an' 'low dat hit 'peared dat he bruder's\r\nstock wus growin' less all de time. Den Mr. Jake sez dat dey done been\r\nstold.\r\n\r\n'Why doan you punish dem thievin' niggers, Jake'?\r\n\r\nJake gits mad an' has dese three niggers brung out, deir shirts am\r\npulled off an' dey am staked down on deir stomichs, an' de oberseer gits\r\nwored out, an' leavin' de niggers tied, dar in de sun, dey goes ter de\r\nhouse ter git some brandy.\r\n\r\nDey more dey drinks from de white crock de better humor dey gits in. Dey\r\nlaughs an' talks an' atter awhile dey think o' de niggers, an' back dey\r\ngoes an' beats 'em some more. Dis usually lasts all de day, case hit am\r\nfun ter dem.\r\n\r\nAtter so long dey ketched Jack Ashe, a Free Issue, wid one of de pigs,\r\nan' dey whups him twixt drinks all de day, an' at night dey carried him\r\nter de Raleigh jail. He wus convicted an' sent ter Bald Head Island ter\r\nwuck on de breastworks durin' de war an' he ain't neber come back.\r\n\r\n[HW: Asterisk in margin] Dar wus a man in Raleigh what had two blood\r\nhoun's an' he made his livin' by ketchin' runaway niggers.

I 'members de only time dat I eber got drunk wus long den. De\r\ndoctor an' his frien's wus splurgin', an' I went wid another nigger ter\r\ngit de brandy from de cellar fer de guests. When I tasted hit, hit drunk\r\nso good, an' so much lak sweetin water dat I drunk de pitcher full. I\r\nwus drunk three days.\r\n\r\nI married Milly, an' sixty years ago we moved ter town.

I knowed dat I ought ter be\r\nskeered but I ain't, an' so I stands dar an' watches.\r\n\r\nSuddenly as dey passes de bank out rides two mens frum Wheeler's calvary\r\nan' dey gits in de middle o' de street one of de hosses wheels back an'\r\nde man shot right at de Yankees, den he flewed frum dar.\r\n\r\nTwo of de Yankees retracts frum de army an' dey flies atter de Rebs.\r\nWhen de Rebs git ter de Capitol one o' dem flies down Morgan Street an'\r\none goes out Hillsboro Street wid de Yankees hot in behin' him.\r\n\r\nDey ketched him out dar at de Hillsboro Bridge when his hoss what wus\r\nalready tired, stumbles an' he falls an' hurts his leg.\r\n\r\nDurin' dat time de big man wid de red hair what dey calls Kilpatrick\r\nbrung his men up on de square an' sets under de trees an' a gang o'\r\npeople comes up.\r\n\r\nWhen dey brung de young good lookin' Reb up ter de redheaded Gen'l he\r\nsez 'What you name Reb?'\r\n\r\nDe boy sez, 'Robert Walsh, sir.\r\n\r\nWhat for did you done go an' shoot at my army?\r\n\r\n\"Case I hates de Yankees an' I wush dat dey wus daid in a pile,\" de Reb\r\nsez, an' laughs.\r\n\r\n\"De Gen'l done got his dander up now, an' he yells,\" 'Carry de Reb\r\nsommers out'r sight o' de ladies an' hang him.'\r\n\r\nDe Reb laughs an' sez, 'kin' o' you sir,' an' he waves goodbye ter de\r\ncrowd an' dey carried him off a laughin' fit ter kill.\r\n\r\nDey hanged him on a ole oak tree in de Lovejoy grove, whar de Governor's\r\nmansion am now standin' an' dey buried him under de tree.\r\n\r\nWay atter de war dey moved his skileton ter Oakwood Cemetery an' put him\r\nup a monument. His grave wus kivered wid flowers, an' de young ladies\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nHe died brave do', an' he kep' laughin' till his neck broke. I wus dar\r\nan' seed hit, furdermore dar wus a gang of white ladies dar, so dey\r\nmight as well a hanged him on de Capitol Square.\r\n\r\nDe Yankees wus good ter me, but hit shore wus hard ter git a job do',\r\nan' so I ain't fared as good as I did' fore de war.\r\n\r\nMr. Buck wus good ter us. Sometimes he'd lose his temper an' cuss, den\r\nhe'd say right quick, 'God forgive me, I pray.' Dat man believed in\r\n'ligion. When de oberseer, George Harris, 'ud start ter beat a slave dey\r\nlarned ter yell fer Mr. Buck an' make lak dey wus gittin' kilt.\r\n\r\nMr. Buck'd come stompin' an' yellin' 'stop beatin' dat nigger.\r\n\r\nCourse dis ruint de slaves, case dey could talk lak dey pleased ter Mr.\r\nHarris, an' iffen dey could yell loud nuff dey ain't got no whuppin'.\r\n\r\nYessum, I'se glad slavery am over; we owns dis home an' some chickens,\r\nbut we shore does need de ole age pension. I'se got two fine gran'sons,\r\nbut let me tell you dey needs ter wuck harder, eat less, an' drink less.\r\n\r\nOn de count o' dem boys I wants de ABC Stores so's dey won't drink box\r\nlye.\r\n\r\nEH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

I was 'bout\r\neight years ole when de Yankees come through. Chillun in dem days wus\r\nnot paid much mind like dey is now. White chillun nor nigger chillun wus\r\nnot spiled by tenshun.\r\n\r\nI got enough to eat to live on an' dat wus 'bout all I keered 'bout. Des\r\nso I could git a little to eat and could play all de time. I stayed\r\nouten de way of de grown folks. No, chillun wus not noticed like dey is\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nI heard de grown folks talkin' 'bout de Yankees. De niggers called 'em\r\nblue jackets. Den one mornin', almost 'fore I knowed it, de yard wus\r\nfull of 'em. Dey tried to ride de hosses in de house, dey caught de\r\nchickens, killed de shoats and took de horses an' anything else dey\r\nwanted. Dey give de nigger hardtack an' pickled meat. I 'members eating\r\nsome of de meat, I didn't like.\r\n\r\nWe had reasonably good food, clothin', and warm log houses wid stick an'\r\ndirt chimleys. De houses wus warm enough all de time in winter, and dey\r\ndidn't leak in rainy weather neither.\r\n\r\nDere wus a lot of slaves an' marster an' missus wus good to father an'\r\nmother. When dey had a cornshuckin' we slaves had a good time, plenty to\r\neat, whiskey for de grown folks and a rastlin' match after de corn wus\r\nshucked. A nigger dat shucked a red ear of corn got a extra drink of\r\nwhiskey. Dat wus de custom in dem days.\r\n\r\nNo prayermeetings wus allowed on de plantation but we went to Salem to\r\nwhite folks church and also to white folks church at Cary.\r\n\r\nDey whupped mother 'cause she tried to learn to read, no books wus\r\nallowed. Mother said dat if de blue jackets had not come sooner or later\r\nI would have got de lash.\r\n\r\nMother belonged to Sam Atkins who owned a plantation about ten miles\r\ndown de Ramkatte Road in Wake County. Father belonged to Turner Utley\r\nand father wus named Jacob Utley and mother wus named Lucy Utley. My\r\nmaiden name wus Chaney Utley. Dey wurked from sun to sun on de\r\nplantation.\r\n\r\nWhen de surrender come father an' mother come to town an' stayed about a\r\nyear an' den went back to ole marster's plantation. Dey wus fed a long\r\ntime on hardtack and pickled meat, by de Yankees, while in town. Dey\r\nstayed a long time wid ole marster when dey got back. Mother wus his\r\ncook. Rats got after mother in town an' she went back to marsters an'\r\ntole him 'bout it an' tole him she had come back home, dat she wus fraid\r\nto stay in town an' marster jes' laughted an' tole us all to come right\r\nin. He tole mother to go an' cook us all sumptin to eat an' she did. We\r\nwus all glad to git back home.\r\n\r\nI wus too little to wurk much but I played a lot an' swept yards. We\r\ndrank water outen gourds an' marster would tell me to bring him a gourd\r\nfull of cool water when he wus settin' in his arm chair on de porch. I\r\nthought big of waitin' on marster, yes, dat I did.\r\n\r\nDere wus fourteen of us in family, father, mother an' twelve chilluns.\r\nDere is three of us livin', two of de boys an' me.\r\n\r\nSlavery wus a good thing from what I knows 'bout it. While I liked de\r\nYankees wid dere purty clothes, I didn't like de way dey took marster's\r\nstuff an' I tole 'em so. Mother made me hush. Dey took chickens, meat,\r\nhogs an' horses.\r\n\r\nWe finally left ole marster's plantation an' moved Jes' a little way\r\nover on another plantation. Mother an' father died there.\r\n\r\nI married Sam Hews in Wake County when I wus fifteen years old. I had no\r\nchildren. After we wus married we stayed on de farm a year or two den we\r\nmoved to Raleigh. We have wurked for white folks ever since, an' I am\r\nstill wurkin' for 'em now all I am able. I washes an' irons clothes.\r\nSometimes I can't wash, I ain't able, but I does de bes' I can.

I lives at 527 So. Haywood. St. Raleigh, N. C. Now\r\ndere is one thing I want to know, is dis thing goin' to cost me\r\nanything. Hold on a minute, and le' me see. I want to be square, and I\r\nmust be square. Now le' me see, le' me see sumpin'. Sometimes folks come\r\nhere and dey writes and writes; den dey asts me, is you goin' to pay dis\r\nnow? What will it cost? Well, if it costs nothin' I'll gib you what I\r\nknows.\r\n\r\nLet me git my Bible. I wants to be on de square, because I got to leave\r\nhere some of dese days. Dis is a record from de slave books. I've been\r\ntryin' to git my direct age for 35 years. My cousin got my age. I wuz\r\nborn April 10, 1857. My mother's name wuz Sarah High. Put down when she\r\nwuz born, Oct. 24, 1824. This is from the old slave books. We both\r\nbelonged to Green High, the young master. The old master, I nebber seed\r\nhim; but I saw old missus, Mis' Laney High. The old master died before I\r\nwuz born. We lived two miles north uv Zebulon. You know where Zebulon is\r\nin Wake County? I had two brothers, one brother named Taylor High,\r\n'nother named Ruffin High. My sister died mighty young. She come here\r\nwrong; she died. I' member seeing my uncle take her to the grave yard. I\r\ndon't know whe're there's enny rec'ord o' her or not.\r\n\r\nMy work in slavery times wuz ridin' behin' my Missus, Clara Griffin, who\r\nwuz my old missus' sister's daughter. She came to be our missus. When\r\nshe went visiting I rode behind her. I also looked atter de garden, kept\r\nchickens out uv de garden, and minded de table, fanned flies off de\r\ntable. They were good to us. Dey whupped us sometime. I wuz not old\r\nenough to do no fiel' work.\r\n\r\nOne time I slep' late. It wuz in the fall uv the year. The other\r\nchilluns had lef' when I got up. I went out to look for 'em. When I\r\ncrossed the tater patch I seen the ground cracked and I dug in to see\r\nwhat cracked it. I found a tater and kept diggin' till I dug it up. I\r\ncarried it to the house. They had a white woman for a cook that year. I\r\ncarried the tater and showed it to her. She took me and the tater and\r\ntold me to come on. We went from the kitchen to the great house and she\r\nshowed the tater to the old missus sayin', 'Look here missus, Joe has\r\nbeen stealin' taters. Here is the tater he stole'. Old missus said, 'Joe\r\nbelongs to me, the tater belongs to me, take it back and cook it for\r\nhim. When the cook cooked the tater she asked me for half uv it. I gave\r\nit to her. If I had known den lak I knows now, she wuz tryin' to git me\r\nto git a whoppin' I wouldn't 'er give her none uv dat tater.\r\n\r\nThere were some frame houses, an part log houses, we called 'em the\r\ndarkey houses. The master's house wuz called 'the great house'. We had\r\nvery good places to sleep and plenty to eat. I got plenty uv potlicker,\r\npeas, and pumpkins. All us little darkies et out uv one bowl. We used\r\nmussel shells, got on the branch, for spoons. Dey must not er had no\r\nspoons or sumpin. The pea fowls roosted on de great house evey night. I\r\ndidn't know whut money nor matches wuz neither.\r\n\r\nI 'member seein' Henry High, my first cousin, ketch a pike once, but I\r\nnever done no fishin' or huntin'. I 'member seein' the grown folks start\r\noff possum huntin' at night, but I did not go.\r\n\r\nI wore wooden bottom shoes and I wore only a shirt. I went in my shirt\r\ntail until I wuz a great big boy, many years atter slavery. There were\r\n50 or more slaves on the plantation. Old women wove cloth on looms. We\r\nmade syrup, cane syrup, with a cane mill. We carried our corn to\r\nFoster's Mill down on Little River to have it ground. It wuz called\r\nLittle River den; I don't know whut it is called in dis day.\r\n\r\nThere wuz a block in de yard, where missus got up on her horse. There\r\nwere two steps to it. Slaves were sold from this block. I 'member seein'\r\nthem sold from this block. George High wuz one, but they got him back.\r\n\r\nDey did not teach us anything about books; dey did not teach us anything\r\nabout readin' and writin'. I went to church at the Eppsby Church near\r\nBuffalo, not far from Wakefield. We sat in a corner to ourselves.\r\n\r\nMy brother Taylor ran away. Young master sent him word to come on back\r\nhome; he won't goin' to whup him, and he come back. Yes, he come back.\r\n\r\nWe played the games uv marbles, blind fold, jumpin', and racin', and\r\njumpin' the rope. The doctor looked atter us when we were sick,\r\nsometimes, but it wuz mostly done by old women. Dey got erbs and dey gib\r\nus wormfuge. Dey worked us out. I wuz not old enough to pay much\r\nattention to de doctor's name.\r\n\r\nI 'members one day my young master, Green High, and me wuz standin' in\r\nde front yard when two men come down the avenue from de main road to the\r\nhouse. Dey wanted to know how fer it wuz to Green High's. Master told\r\n'em it wuz about 2 miles away and gave 'em the direction. Dey were\r\nYankees. Dey got on their horses and left. Dey didn't know dey wuz\r\ntalking to Green High then. When dey left, master left. I didn't see\r\nhim no more in a long time. Soon next day the yard wuz full uv Yankee\r\nsoldiers. I 'members how de buttons on dere uniforms shined. Dey got\r\ncorn, meat, chickens, and eveything they wanted. Day didn't burn the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nOld man Bert Doub or Domb kept nigger hounds. When a nigger run away he\r\nwould ketch him for de master. De master would send atter him and his\r\ndogs when a nigger run away. I 'member one overseer, a Negro, Hamp High\r\nand another Coff High. Nobody told me nothin' about being free and I\r\nknowed nothin' 'bout whut it meant.\r\n\r\nI married Rosetta Hinton. She belonged to the Hintons during slavery.\r\nShe is dead; she's been dead fourteen years. We were married at her\r\nmother's home; the river plantation belonging to the Hintons. I wuz\r\nmarried by a preacher at this home. Atter the wedding we had good things\r\nto eat and we played games. All stayed there that night and next day we\r\nwent back to whar I wuz workin' on de Gen. Cox's farm. I wuz workin'\r\ndere. We had 6 chillun. Two died at birth. All are dead except one in\r\nDurham named Tommie High and one in New York City. Tommie High works in\r\na wheat mill. Eddie High is a cashermiser, (calciminer) works on walls.\r\n\r\nI thought slavery wuz right. I felt that this wuz the way things had to\r\ngo, the way they were fixed to go. I wuz satisfied. The white folks\r\ntreated me all right. My young missus loved me and I loved her. She\r\nwhupped me sometimes. I think just for fun sometimes, when I wuz ridin'\r\nbehind her, she would tell me to put my arms around her and hold to her\r\napron strings. One day she wuz sittin' on the side saddle; I wuz sittin'\r\nbehind her. She wud try to git old Dave, the horse she wuz a ridin to\r\nwalk; she would say, 'Ho Dave', den I wud kick de horse in de side and\r\nshe wud keep walkin' on. She asked me, 'Joe, why does Dave not want to\r\nstop?'\r\n\r\nI saw a lot of Yankees, I wuz afraid of 'em. They called us Johnnie,\r\nSusie, and tole us they wouldn't hurt us.\r\n\r\nI think Abraham Lincoln is all right, I guess, the way he saw it. I\r\nthink he was like I wuz as a boy from what I read, and understand; he\r\nwuz like me jest the way he saw things. I liked the rules, and ways o'\r\nmy old master and missus, while the Yankees and Abraham Lincoln gave me\r\nmore rest.\r\n\r\nHow did I learn to read? Atter de war I studies. I wonts ter read de\r\nhymms an' songs. I jis picks up de readin' myself.\r\n\r\nIt's quare to me, I cannot remember one word my mother ever said to me,\r\nnot nary a word she said can I remember. I remember she brought me hot\r\npotlicker and bread down to the house of mornings when I wuz small; but\r\nI'se been tryin to 'member some words she spoke to me an' I cain't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

My father he wus George Merritt an' he belonged to Ben\r\nMerritt, Ivan Proctor's grandfather. Dey lived on a plantation near\r\nEagle Rock, Wake County. Dey called de creek near by Mark's Creek.\r\n\r\nMy parents said dat dey had a mighty hard time, an' dat durin' slavery\r\ntime, de rules wus mighty strict. De hours of work on de farm wus from\r\nsun to sun wid no time 'cept at Christmas and at lay-by time, 4th of\r\nJuly for anything but work. Dey were not 'lowed no edication, and very\r\nlittle time to go to church. Sometimes de went to de white folks church.\r\nMother said dey whupped de slaves if dey broke de rules.\r\n\r\nDey said de overseers were worse den de slave owners. De overseers were\r\nginerally white men hired by de marster. My father said dey had poor\r\nwhite men to overseer, and de slave owner would go on about his business\r\nand sometimes didn't know an' didn't eben care how mean de overseer wus\r\nto de slaves.\r\n\r\nDere wus a lot o' things to drink, dey said, cider, made from apples,\r\nwhiskey, an' brandy. Dey said people didn't notice it lak dey do now,\r\nnot many got drunk, cause dere wus plenty of it. Father said it wus ten\r\ncents a quart, dat is de whiskey made outen corn, and de brandy wus\r\ncheap too.\r\n\r\nDey said de clothes were wove, an' dat mos' chillun went barefooted, an'\r\nin dere shirt tails; great big boys, goin' after de cows, and feedin' de\r\nhorses, an' doin' work around de house in deir shirt tails. Grown slaves\r\ngot one pair o' shoes a year an' went barefooted de res' o' de time.\r\nBiscuit wus a thing dey seldom got.\r\n\r\nWomen cleared land by rollin' logs into piles and pilin' brush in de new\r\ngrounds. Dey were 'lowed patches, but dey used what dey made to eat.\r\nDaddy said dey didn't have time to fish and hunt any. Dey were too tired\r\nfor dat. Dey had to work so hard.\r\n\r\nDaddy said he wus proud o' freedom, but wus afraid to own it. Dey prayed\r\nfer freedom secretly. When de Yankees come daddy saved a two horse wagon\r\nload of meat for marster by takin' it off in de swamp and hidin' it, an'\r\nden marster wouldn't give him nary bit uv it. After de surrender, dey\r\nturned him out wid a crowd o' little chillun wid out a thing. Dey give\r\nhim nothin'. My mother saved her marster's life, Charles Underhill.\r\n\r\nWell you see he wus takin' care uv a lot o' meat and whiskey for Dick\r\nJordon, an' de Yankees come an' he treated 'em from whiskey he had in a\r\nbottle, an' tole 'em he had no more. Dey searched his home an' found it\r\nin a shed room, an' den dey said dey were goin' to kill him for tellin'\r\n'em a lie. She herd [HW correction: heard] 'em talkin' and she busted\r\nthrough de crowd and told 'em dat de stuff belonged to anudder man and\r\ndat her marster was not lyin', an' not to hurt 'im. De Yankees said,\r\n'You have saved dis ole son of a bitch, we won't kill' em den.' Dey took\r\nall de meat, whiskey, an' everything dey wanted. Marster promised mother\r\na cow, and calf, a sow, and pigs for what she had done for him an' to\r\nstay on an' finish de crop. When de fall o' de year come he did not give\r\nher de wrappin's o' her finger. Dat's what my mudder tole me. We wus\r\nteached to call 'em mammie and pappie. I is gwine to tell you just\r\nzackly like it is we were taught dese things. I wants to be pasidefily\r\nright in what I tell you.\r\n\r\nWe lef' dat place an' mammie an' pappie farmed wid Solomon Morgan a Free\r\nIssue for several years. De family had typhoid fever an' five were down\r\nwith it at one time. But de Lawd will provide. Sich as dat makes me say\r\npeople wont die till deir time comes. Dere is some mighty good white\r\npeople in dis place in America, and also bad. If it hadn't been for 'em\r\nwe colored folks would have ben in a mighty bad fix. We got our jobs and\r\nhelp from 'em to git us to de place we are at. Dr. Henry Montague\r\ndoctored us and none died. It wusn't dere time to go. No, no, hit wasn't\r\ndeir time to go. We then moved back to Marster's for a year, and then we\r\nmoved to Rolesville in Wake County.\r\n\r\nI married den and moved to Raleigh. I married Robert High. He is dead.\r\nHe been dead 'bout 30 years. I don't know much 'bout Abraham Lincoln I\r\nthink he wus a fine man.

We 'longed to the Jeffersons there and we went by the name of\r\nJefferson when we wus sold and brought to N. C. I do not 'member my\r\ngrandparents on my mother's or father's side. Mother had one boy an'\r\nthree girls. The boy wus named Robert, an' the girls were Kate, Rosa and\r\nKitty. Marster Long bought mother an' all de chilluns, but mother never\r\nseed father anymore atter he wus sent off to de war.\r\n\r\nI married Green Hill in Chatham County. I married him at Moncure about\r\nnine miles from Pittsboro. We lived at Moncure and mother moved there\r\nan' we lived together for a long time. When we left Moncure we come ter\r\nRaleigh. Mother had died long time 'fore we left Moncure, Chatham\r\nCounty. We moved ter Raleigh atter de World War.\r\n\r\nMother used ter tell we chilluns stories of patterollers ketchin'\r\nniggers an' whuppin' 'em an' of how some of de men outrun de\r\npatterollers an' got away. Dere wus a song dey used to sing, it went\r\nlike dis. Yes sir, ha! ha!

'Run nigger run, Patteroller ketch you, run\r\n    nigger run like you did de udder day.'\r\n\r\nMy mother said she wus treated good. Yes she said dey wus good ter her\r\nin Virginia. Mother said de slave men on de Jefferson plantation in\r\nVirginia would steal de hosses ter ride ter dances at night. One time a\r\nhoss dey stole an' rode ter a dance fell dead an' dey tried ter tote him\r\nhome. Mother laughted a lot about dat. I heard my mother say dat de\r\ncavalry southern folks was bout de meanest in de war. She talked a lot\r\nabout Wheeler's cavalry.\r\n\r\nDere wus a lot of stealin' an' takin' meat, silver, stock an' anything.\r\nHosses, cows an' chickens jist didn't have no chance if a Yankee laid\r\nhis eyes on 'em. A Yankee wus pisen to a yard full of fowls. Dey killed\r\nturkeys, chickens and geese. Now dats de truth. Mother said de Yankees\r\nskinned turkeys, chickens and geese 'fore dey cooked 'em. Sometimes dey\r\nwould shoot a hog an' jist take de hams an' leave de rest dere to spile.\r\nDey would kill a cow, cut off de quarters an' leave de rest ter rot.\r\n\r\nMother said no prayer meetings wus allowed de slaves in Virginia where\r\nshe stayed. Dey turned pots down ter kill de noise an' held meetings at\r\nnight. Dey had niggers ter watch an' give de alarm if dey saw de white\r\nfolks comin'. Dey always looked out for patterollers. Dey were not\r\nallowed any edication an' mother could not read and write nuther.\r\n\r\nI 'member de Ku Klux an' how dey beat people. One night a man got away\r\nfrom 'em near whar we lived in Chatham County. He lived out in de edge\r\nof de woods; and when dey knocked on de door he jumped out at a back\r\nwindow in his night clothes wid his pants in his hands an' outrun 'em.\r\nDere wus rocks in de woods whar he run an' dat nigger jist tore his feet\r\nup. Dey went ter one nigger's house up dere an' de door' wus barred up.\r\nDey got a ax an' cut a hole in de door. When de hole got big enough de\r\nnigger blammed down on 'em wid a gun an' shot one of dere eyes out. You\r\nknow de Ku Klux went disguised an' when dey got ter your house dey would\r\nsay in a fine voice, Ku Klux, Ku Klux, Ku Klux, Ku Klux.\r\n\r\n[HW correction: New paragraph] Some people say dey are in slavery now\r\nan' dat de niggers never been in nothin' else; but de way some of it wus\r\nI believe it wus a bad thing. Some slaves fared all right though an' had\r\na good time an' liked slavery.\r\n\r\nLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District:     No. 2               [320218]\r\nWorker:             T.

I wus borned in February, 1855. I am not\r\nable ter work. I work all I can. I am trying ter do de best I can ter\r\nhelp myself. Yes, just tryin' ter do sumpin, ain't able ter work much. I\r\nam ruptured, an' old. My old house looks 'bout old as I do, it's 'bout\r\nto fall down, ain't able ter fix it up. It needs repairing. I ain't able\r\nter make no repairs.\r\n\r\nI wus born on a plantation in Wake County. My master wus Richard\r\nSeawell, an' Missus wus named Adelaide. His plantation wus on Neuse\r\nRiver. He had two plantations, but I wus a little boy, an' don't\r\nremember how many acres in de plantation or how many slaves. There wus a\r\nlot of 'em tho'. I would follow master 'round an' look up in his face so\r\nhe would give me biscuit an' good things ter eat.\r\n\r\nMy mother, before marriage, wus named Silvia Seawell, an' father wus\r\nnamed Andrew Hinton. Atter they wus married mother went by the name of\r\nHinton, my father's family name. I had--I don't know--mos' anything wus\r\ngood ter me. Master brought me biscuit an' I thought that wus the\r\ngreatest thing at all. Yes, I got purty good food. Our clothes wus not\r\nfine, but warm. I went barefooted mos' o' the time, an' in summer I went\r\nin my shirt tail.\r\n\r\nDey called de slave houses 'quarters', de house where de overseer lived\r\nwus de 'Overseer's House'. Master had a overseer to look atter his men;\r\nDe overseer wus named Bridgers. De house where Master lived wus de\r\n'Great House'.\r\n\r\nDey would not allow us any books. I cannot read an' write. I have seen\r\nde patterollers, but I neber saw' em whip nobody; but I saw' em lookin'\r\nfer somebody ter whup. I've neber seen a slave sold. I've neber seen a\r\njail fer slaves or slaves in chains. I have seen master whup slaves\r\nthough. I wus neber whupped. Dey wrung my ears an' pulled my nose to\r\npunish me.\r\n\r\nDere wus no churches on de plantation, but we had prayer meetin's in our\r\nhomes. We went to de white folks church. My father used to take me by de\r\nhand an' carry me ter church. Daddy belonged ter de Iron Side Baptist\r\nChurch. We called our fathers 'daddy' in slavery time. Dey would not let\r\nslaves call deir fathers 'father'. Dey called 'em 'daddy', an' white\r\nchildren called deir father, 'Pa'. I didn't work any in slavery time,\r\n'cept feed pigs, an' do things fer my master; waited on him. I went\r\n'round wid him a lot, an' I had rather see him come on de plantation\r\nany time dan to see my daddy. I do not remember any possums or other\r\ngame being eaten at our house. I do not remember eber goin' a-fishin\r\ndurin' slavery time.\r\n\r\nMaster had two boys ter go off ter de war. Dey carried 'em off ter de\r\nwar. I don't know how many children dey had, but I remember two of 'em\r\ngoin' off ter de war. Don't know what became of 'em.\r\n\r\nI shore remember de Yankees. Yes sir, Ha! ha! I shore remember dem. Dem\r\nYankees tore down an' drug out ever'thing, dey come across. Dey killed\r\nhogs, an' chickens. Dey took only part of a hog an' lef' de rest. Dey\r\nshot cows, an' sometimes jest cut off de hind quarters an' lef de rest.\r\nDey knocked de heads out o' de barrels o' molasses. Dey took horses,\r\ncows an' eber'thing, but they did not hurt any o' de children. Dey wus\r\nfolks dat would tear down things.\r\n\r\nAtter de surrender my mother moved over on de plantation where my father\r\nstayed. We stayed dere a long time, an' den we moved back to Richard\r\nSeawell's, old master's plantation, stayin' dere a long time. Den we\r\nmoved to Jessie Taylor's place below Raleigh between Crabtree Creek an'\r\nNeuse River. When we lef' Taylor's we moved ter Banner Dam northeast of\r\nRaleigh near Boone's Pond. Mother an' father both died dere. Atter\r\nleaving dere I come here. I have lived in Oberlin ebery since. Guess\r\nI'll die here; if I can git de money to pay my taxes, I know I will die\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nI think slavery wus good because I wus treated all right. I think I am\r\n'bout as much a slave now as ever.\r\n\r\nI don't think any too much o' Abraham Lincoln, Jeff Davis or any o' dem\r\nmen. Don't know much 'bout 'em. Guess Mr. Roosevelt is all right. 'Bout\r\nhalf the folks both black an' white is slaves an' don't know it. When I\r\nwus a slave I had nothin' on me, no responsibility on any of us, only to\r\nwork. Didn't have no taxes to pay, neber had to think whur de next meal\r\nwus comin' from.\r\n\r\nDis country is in a bad fix. Looks like sumptin got to be done someway\r\nor people, a lot of 'em, are goin' to parish to death. Times are hard,\r\nan' dey is gettin' worse. Don't know how I am goin' to make it, if I\r\ndon't git some help. We been prayin' fer rain. Crops are done injured,\r\nbut maybe de Lawd will help us. Yes, I trust in de Lawd.\r\n\r\nI been married twice. I married Henritta Nunn first, an' den Henritta\r\nJones. I had three children by first marriage, an' none b [HW: y] second\r\nmarriage. My wife is over seventy years old. We have a hard time making\r\nenough to git a little sumptin to eat. I wus mighty glad to see you\r\nwhen you come up dis mornin', an' I hopes what I have told you will help\r\nsome one to know how bad we need help. I feels de Lawd will open up de\r\nway.

He wus my marster an' his wife Muriel\r\nwus my missus. My father's name wus Jack Emery an' mother's name was\r\nMinerva Emery. My mother belonged to Willis Thompson and my father\r\nbelonged to Ephriam Emery. Mother stayed with my marster's married\r\ndaughter. She married Johnny K. Moore.\r\n\r\nMarster had three children, all girls; dere names wus Margaret, Caroline\r\nand Nancy. There wus only one slave house dere 'cause dey only had one\r\nslave whur my mother stayed. Marster Thompson had five slaves on his\r\nplantation. He wus good to slaves but his wife wus rough. We had a\r\nreasonably [HW correction] good place to sleep an' fair sumptin to eat.\r\nYou sees I wus mighty young an' I members very little 'bout some things\r\nin slavery but from what my mother an father tole me since de war it wus\r\njust 'bout middlin' livin' at marster's. Slaves wore homemade clothes\r\nan' shoes. De shoes had wooden bottoms but most slave chilluns went\r\nbarefooted winter an' summer till dey wus ole 'nough to go to work. De\r\nfirst pair of shoes I wore my daddy made 'em. I 'member it well. I will\r\nnever furgit it, I wus so pleased wid 'em. All slave chillun I knows\r\nanything 'bout wore homemade clothes an' went barefooted most of the\r\ntime an' bareheaded too.\r\n\r\nI member de Yankees an' how dey had rods searchin' for money an' took\r\nthings. I members a Yankee goin' to mother an' sayin' we was free. When\r\nhe lef' missus come an' axed her what he say to her an' mother tole\r\nmissus what he said an' missus says 'No he didn't tell you you is free,\r\nyou jes axed him wus you free.' Father wus hired out to Frank Page of\r\nGary. He wus cuttin cord wood for him, when he heard de Yankees wus\r\ncoming he come home. When he got dere de Yankees had done been to de\r\nhouse an' gone.\r\n\r\nDurin' slavery dey tried to sell daddy. De speculator wus dere an 'daddy\r\nsuspicion sumpin. His marster tole him to go an' shuck some corn. Dey\r\naimed to git him in de corn crib an' den tie him an' sell him but when\r\nhe got to the crib he kept on goin'. He went to Mr. Henry Buffaloe's an'\r\nstayed two weeks den he went back home. Dere wus nuthin' else said 'bout\r\nsellin him. Dey wanted to sell him an buy a 'oman so dey could have a\r\nlot of slave chilluns cause de 'oman could multiply. Dey hired men out\r\nby the year to contractors to cut cord wood an' build railroads. Father\r\nwus hired out dat way. Ole man Rome Harp wus hired out day way. He\r\nbelonged to John Harp.\r\n\r\nDaddy said his marster never did hit him but one blow. Daddy said he\r\nwurked hard everyday, an' done as near right as he knowed how to do in\r\neverything. His marster got mad ah' hit him wid a long switch. Den daddy\r\ntole him he wus workin' bes' he could for him an' dat he wus not goin'\r\nto take a whuppin. His marster walked off an' dat wus de last of it, an'\r\nhe never tried to whup him again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District: No. 2                    [320225]\r\nWorker:         T.

C.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Robert Hinton. I ain't able to work, ain't been able to do\r\nany work in five years. My wife, Mary Hinton, supports me by workin'\r\nwith the WPA. She was cut off las' May. Since she has had no job, we\r\nhave to live on what she makes with what little washin' she gets from de\r\nwhite folks; an' a little help from charity; dis ain't much. Dey give\r\nyou for one week, one half peck meal, one pound meat, one pound powdered\r\nmilk, one half pound o' coffee. Dis is what we git for one week.\r\n\r\nI wus borned in 1856 on de Fayetteville Road three miles from Raleigh,\r\nsouth. I belonged to Lawrence Hinton. My missus wus named Jane Hinton.\r\nDe Hintons had 'bout twenty slaves on de plantation out dere. Dey had\r\nfour chillun, de boy Ransom an' three girls: Belle, Annie an' Miss Mary.\r\nAll are dead but one, Miss Mary is livin' yit. My mother wus named Liza\r\nHinton an' my father wus named Bob Hinton. My gran'mother wus named Mary\r\nHinton an' gran'father Harry Hinton.\r\n\r\nWe had common food in slavery time, but it wus well fixed up, an' we\r\nwere well clothed. We had a good place to sleep, yes sir, a good place\r\nto sleep. We worked from sunrise to sunset under overseers. Dey were\r\ngood to us. I wus small at dat time. I picked up sticks in de yard an'\r\ndone some work around de house, but when dey turned deir backs I would\r\nbe playin' most o' de time. We played shootin' marbles, an' runnin', an'\r\njumpin'. We called de big house de dwelling house an' de slave quarters\r\nde slave houses. Some of 'em were in marster's yard and some were\r\noutside. Dey give all de families patches and gardens, but dey did not\r\nsell anything.\r\n\r\nWe had prayer meetin' in our houses when we got ready, but dere were no\r\nchurches for niggers on de plantation. We had dances and other socials\r\ndurin' Christmas times. Dey give us de Christmas holidays.\r\n\r\nNo sir, dey did not whup me. I wus mighty young. Dey didn't work chillun\r\nmuch. I have seen 'em whup de grown ones do'. I never saw a slave sold\r\nand never saw any in chains. Dey run away from our plantation but dey\r\ncome back again. William Brickell, Sidney Cook, Willis Hinton all run\r\naway. I don't know why dey all run away but some run away to keep from\r\nbeing whupped.\r\n\r\nI have lived in North Carolina all my life, right here in Wake County.\r\nWe used to set gums and catch rabbits, set traps and caught patridges\r\nand doves.\r\n\r\nYes sir, I went blindin'. I 'members gittin' a big light an' jumpin'\r\n'round de bresh heaps, an' when a bird come out we frailed him down. We\r\nwent gigging fish too. We found 'em lying on de bottom o' de creeks an'\r\nponds at night, an' stuck de gig in 'em an' pulled 'em out.\r\n\r\nDe white folks, ole missus, teached us de catechism, but dey didn't want\r\nyou to learn to read and write. I can read and write now; learned since\r\nde surrender. Sometimes we went to de white folks church. I don't know\r\nany songs.\r\n\r\nWhen we got sick our boss man sent for a doctor, Dr. Burke Haywood, Dr.\r\nJohnson, or Dr. Hill.\r\n\r\nI 'members when de North folks and de Southern folks wus fightin'. De\r\nNorthern soldiers come in here on de Fayetteville Road. I saw 'em by de\r\nhundreds. Dey had colored folks soldiers in blue clothes too. In de\r\nmornin' white soldiers, in de evenin' colored soldiers; dats de way dey\r\ncome to town.\r\n\r\nI married first Almeta Harris. I had six children by her. Second, I\r\nmarried Mary Jones. She is my wife now. We had six children. My wife is\r\nnow 65 years old and she has to support me. I am done give out too much\r\nto work any more.\r\n\r\nYes sir, that I have seen de patterollers, but my old boss didn't 'low\r\n'em to whup his niggers. Marster give his men passes.\r\n\r\nI know when de Ku Klux was here, but I don't know much about 'em.\r\n\r\nI thought slavery wus a bad thing' cause all slaves did not fare alike.\r\nIt wus all right for some, but bad for some, so it wus a bad thing.\r\n\r\nI joined the church because I got religion and thought the church might\r\nhelp me keep it.\r\n\r\nI think Abraham Lincoln wus a good man, but I likes Mr. Roosevelt; he is\r\na good man, a good man.\r\n\r\nAC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

I 'members\r\nseeing de Yankees, it seems like a dream. One come along ridin' a mule.\r\nDey sed he wus a Yankee bummer, a man dat went out raging on peoples\r\nthings. He found out whur the things wus located an' carried the rest\r\nthere. The bummers stole for de army, chickens, hogs, an' anything they\r\ncould take. Atter de bummer come along in a few minutes de whole place\r\nwus crowded wid Yankees. De blue coats wus everywhere I could look.\r\n\r\nMarster didn't have but five slaves, an' when de Yankees come dere wus\r\nonly me an' my oldest sister dere. All de white folks had left except\r\nmissus and her chillun. Her baby wus only three weeks ole then.\r\n\r\nA Yankee come to my oldest sister an' said, 'Whur is dem horses?' He\r\npulled out a large pistol an' sed, 'Tell me whur dem horses is or I will\r\ntake your damn sweet life.' Marster hid de horses an' sister didn't\r\nknow, she stuck to it she didn't know an' de Yankees didn't shoot.\r\n\r\nDey come back, de whole crowd, de next day an' made marster bring in his\r\nhorses. Bey took de horses an' bought some chickens an' paid for 'em,\r\nden dey killed an' took de rest. Ha! ha! dey shore done dat. Paid for\r\nsome an' took de rest.\r\n\r\nI seed de Yankees atter de surrender. Dey wus staying at de ole Soldiers\r\nHome on New Bern Avenue. One day mother carried me there to sell to 'em.\r\nOne time she went there an' she had a rooster who wus a game. His eyes\r\nwus out from fighting another game rooster belonging to another person\r\nnear our home, Mr. Emory Sewell. She carried de rooster in where dere\r\nwus a sick Yankee. De Yankee took him in his hands an' de rooster\r\ncrowed. He give mother thirty-five cents for him. De Yankee said if he\r\ncould crow an' his eyes out he wanted him. He said, he called dat spunk.\r\n\r\nDere wus a man who wus a slave dat belonged to Mr. Kerney Upchurch come\r\nalong riding a mule. My oldest sister, de one de Yankees threatened,\r\ntole him de Yankees are up yonder. He said, 'Dad lim de Yankees.' He\r\nwent on, when he got near de Yankees dey tole him to halt.' Instead of\r\nhaltin' he sold out runnin' the mule fur de ole field. Der wus a gang of\r\nyoung fox hounds dere. When he lit out on de mule, dey thought he wus\r\ngoin' huntin' so dey took out atter him, jest like dey wus atter a fox.\r\nSome of de Yankees shot at him, de others just almost died a laughin'.\r\n\r\nWe didn't git much to eat. Mother said it wus missus fault, she was so\r\nstingy.\r\n\r\nWe had homemade clothes an' wooden bottom shoes for de grown folks, but\r\nchillun did not wear shoes den, dey went barefooted.\r\n\r\nAll de slaves lived in one house built about one hundred yards from the\r\ngreat house, marsters house wus called the great house.\r\n\r\nMy father wus named Robin Hinton an' my mother wus named Dafney Hinton.\r\nMy father belonged to Betsy Ransom Hinton an' mother belonged first to\r\nReddin Cromb in Lenoir County an' then to James Thompson of Wake County.\r\nI wus borned after mother wus brought to Wake County. Marster had one\r\nboy named Beuregard, four girls, Caroline, Alice, Lena and Nellie. I do\r\nnot remember my grandparents.\r\n\r\nI saw a slave named Lucinda, sold to ole man Askew, a speculator, by\r\nKerney Upchurch. I seed 'em carry her off.\r\n\r\nOne of de slave men who belonged to ole man Burl Temples wus sent to\r\nwurk for Mr. Temples' son who had married. His missus put him to totin'\r\nwater before goin' to wurk in de mornin'. Three other slaves toted water\r\nalso. He refused to tote water an' ran. She set de blood hounds atter\r\nhim an' caught him near his home, which wus his ole marster's house. Ole\r\nmarster's son come out, an' wouldn't let 'em whup him, an' they wouldn't\r\nmake him go back.\r\n\r\nMissus Harriet Temples wus a terrible 'oman, a slave jest couldn't suit\r\nher. De slave dat run away from young marster wus finally sent back.\r\nHis marster give him a shoulder of meat before he left. He hung it in a\r\ntree. Missus tole him to put it in the smoke house. He refused, sayin'\r\nhe would see it no more.\r\n\r\nA slave by the name of Sallie Temples run away 'cause her missus, Mary\r\nTemples, wus so mean to her. She stuck hot irons to her. Made 'em drink\r\nmilk an' things for punishment is what my mother an' father said. Sallie\r\nnever did come back. Nobody never did know what become of her.\r\n\r\nSoon as de war wus over father an' mother left dere marsters. Dey went\r\nto Mr. Tom Bridgers. We lived on de farm atter dis. Mother cooked,\r\nsister an' I worked on de farm. Sister plowed like a man. De first help\r\nmy mammy got wus from de Yankees, it wus pickle meat an' hardtack. I wus\r\nwid her an' dey took me in an' give me some clothes. Mother drawed from\r\n'em a long time. We have farmed most our lives. Sometimes we worked as\r\nhirelings and den as share croppers.

I 'members dat somebody in town had a fuss\r\nwid Marse Rufus 'bout lettin' his niggers run loose in town.

My father and mother belonged to\r\nMr. L. B. Huggins. My father was a carpenter and ship builder an' the\r\nfirst things I remember was down on Myrtle Grove Sound, where Mr.\r\nHuggins had a place. I was a sort of bad boy an' liked to roam 'round.\r\nWhen I was about twelve years old I ran away. It was in 1863 when the\r\nwar was goin' on.\r\n\r\nNobody was bein' mean to me. No, I was'nt bein' whipped. Don't you know\r\nall that story 'bout slaves bein' whipped is all _Bunk_, (with scornful\r\nemphasis). What pusson with any sense is goin' to take his horse or his\r\ncow an' beat it up. It's prope'ty. We was prope'ty. Val'able prope'ty.\r\nNo, indeed, Mr. Luke give the bes' of attention to his colored people,\r\nan' Mis' Huggins was like a mother to my mother. Twa'nt anythin' wrong\r\nabout home that made me run away. I'd heard so much talk 'bout freedom I\r\nreckon I jus' wanted to try it, an' I thought I had to get away from\r\nhome to have it.\r\n\r\nWell, I coaxed two other boys to go with me, an' a grown man he got the\r\nboat an' we slipped off to the beach an' put out to sea. Yes'm, we sho'\r\nwas after adventure. But, we did'n get very far out from sho', an' I saw\r\nthe lan' get dimmer an' dimmer, when I got skeered, an' then I got\r\nseasick, an' we was havin' more kinds of adventure than we wanted, an'\r\nthen we saw some ships. There was two of 'em, an' they took us on board.\r\n\r\nThey was the North Star an' the Eastern Star of the Aspinwal Line, a\r\nmail an' freighter runnin' between Aspinwal near the Isthmus of Panama\r\nand New York. We used to put in off Charleston.\r\n\r\nThen, in 1864 I joined the Union Navy. Went on board our convoy, the\r\nNereus. We convoyed to keep the Alabama, a Confederate privateer, away.\r\nThe Commander of the Nereus asked me how's I like to be his cabin boy.\r\nSo I was 2nd class cabin boy an' waited on the Captain. He was Five\r\nStripe Commander J. C. Howell. He was Commander of the whole fleet off\r\nFort Fisher. When the Captain wanted somethin' good to eat he used to\r\nsend me ashore for provisions. He liked me. He was an old man. He didn't\r\ntake much stock in fun, but he was a real man. I was young an' was'nt\r\nserious. I jus' wanted a good time. I don't know much about the war, but\r\nI do know two men of our boat was killed on shore while we was at Fort\r\nFisher.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Fort Fisher, we was on our way to Aspinwal. Layin'\r\noff one day at Navassa Island, the Mast Head reported a strange sail.\r\n'Where away?' 'Just ahead'. 'She seems to be a three mast steamer!'\r\n'Which way headed?' We decided it was the Alabama going to St. Nicholas\r\nMole, West Indies.\r\n\r\nOur Captain called the officers together an' held a meetin'. Says he:\r\n'We'll go under one bell (slow). Lieutenant will go ashore an' get some\r\ninformation.' When we got there she had a coal schooner alongside taking\r\non coal. Our Captain prepared to capture her when she came out. But she\r\ndid'n come out 'til night. She dodged. Good thing too. She'd a knocked\r\nhells pete out o' us. She was close to the water and could have fought\r\nus so much better than we could her. We didn't want to fight 'cause we\r\nknowed enough to jest natu'ally be skeered. She was a one decker man o'\r\nwar. We was a two decker with six guns on berth deck, an' five guns on\r\nspar deck. I never saw her after that, but I heard she was contacted by\r\nthe Kearsage which sunk her off some island.\r\n\r\nI stayed in the navy eighteen months. Was discharged at the Brooklyn\r\nNavy Yard. Admiral Porter was Admiral of the U. S. Navy at that time.\r\n\r\nI stayed in New York five or six years, then I cane home to my mother. I\r\nwas in the crude drug business in Wilmington for twenty years.\r\n\r\nYes'm I went to church and Sunday school when I was a child, when they\r\ncould ketch me. Whilst I was in New York I went to church regular.\r\n\r\nI married after awhile. My wife died about ten years ago. We had one\r\nson. I b'lieve he's in Baltimore, but I ain't heard from him in a long\r\ntime. He don't keer nothin' about me. Of co'se I'm comfortable. I gits\r\nmy pension, $75 a month. I give $10 of it to my nephew who's a cripple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C. District: No. 2                    [320124]\r\nWorker:         T.

HUNTER, 80 years old,\r\n2213 Barker Street\r\nWest Raleigh\r\n\r\n\r\nMy full name is Charlie H. Hunter. I wus borned an' reared in Wake\r\nCounty, N. C., born May, 1857. My mother wus Rosa Hunter an' my father\r\nwus named Jones. I never saw my father. We belonged to a family named\r\nJones first, an' then we wus sold to a slave owner seven miles Northwest\r\nby the name Joe Hayes an' a terrible man he wus. He would get mad 'bout\r\nmost anything, take my mother, chain her down to a log and whup her\r\nunmercifully while I, a little boy, could do nothing but stan' there an'\r\ncry, an' see her whupped. We had fairly good food an' common clothing.\r\nWe had good sleeping places. My mother wus sold to a man named Smith. I\r\nmarried first Annie Hayes who lived sixteen months.\r\n\r\nNo prayer meetings wus allowed on de plantations an' no books of any\r\nkind. I can read an' write, learned in a school taught by Northern folks\r\nafter the surrender, Mr. an' Mrs. Graves who taught in Raleigh in the\r\nrear of the African Methodist Episcopal church. The school house wus\r\nowned by the church. We played no games in slavery times. I saw slaves\r\nsold on the block once in Raleigh.\r\n\r\nI wus to be sold but the surrender stopped it. When the Yankees come\r\nthey asked me where wus my marster. I told them I didn't know. Marster\r\ntold me not to tell where he wus. He had gone off into the woods to hide\r\nhis silver. In a few minutes the ground wus covered with Yankees. The\r\nYankees stole my pen knife. I thought a lot of it. Knives wus scarce and\r\nhard to get. I cried about they taking it. They got my marster's\r\ncarriage horses, two fine gray horses. His wife had lost a brother, who\r\nhad been in the army but died at home. He wus buried in the yard. The\r\nYankees thought the grave wus a place where valuables wus buried and\r\nthey had to get a guard to keep them from diggin' him up. They would\r\nshoot hogs, cut the hams and shoulders off, stick them on their\r\nbayonetts, throw them over the'r shoulders an' go on.\r\n\r\nWe called our houses shanties in slavery time. I never saw any\r\npatterollers. I don't remember how many slaves on the plantation wus\r\ntaken to Richmond an' sold. My mother looked after us when we wus sick.\r\nI had four brothers an' no sisters. They are all dead. I did house work\r\nan' errands in slavery time. I have seen one gang of Ku Klux. They wus\r\nunder arrest at Raleigh in Governor Holden's time. I don't remember the\r\noverseer.\r\n\r\nWe moved to Raleigh at the surrender. Marster give us a old mule when we\r\nleft him, an' I rode him into Raleigh. We rented a house on Wilmington\r\nStreet, an' lived on hard tack the Yankees give us 'til we could git\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nMother went to cooking for the white folks, but I worked for Mr. Jeff\r\nFisher. I held a job thirty-five years driving a laundry truck for L. R.\r\nWyatt. The laundry wus on the corner of Jones an' Salisbury Street.\r\n\r\nI married Cenoro Freeman. We lived together fifty-six years. She wus a\r\ngood devoted wife. We wus married Dec. 9, 1878. She died in May\r\n1934. [HW: bracket] Booker T. Washington wus a good man. I have seen him.\r\nAbraham Lincoln wus one of my best friends. He set me free. The Lawd is\r\nmy best friend. I don't know much 'bout Jefferson Davis. Jim Young an'\r\nmyself wus pals.\r\n\r\nMy object in joining the church wus to help myself an' others to live a\r\ndecent life, a life for good to humanity an' for God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. C.

I had three sisters who wuz named Caroline, Emiline\r\nan' Ann.\r\n\r\nMassa Hunter wuz good to us, an' young Massa Knox wuz good too. My mammy\r\nwuz de cook an' my pappy wuz a field hand. Massa ain't 'lowed no\r\npatterollers on his place, but one time when he wuzn't ter home my mammy\r\nsent me an' Caroline ter de nex' door house fer something an' de\r\npatterollers got us.

'My pappy\r\npatterolls dis place hisself.'\r\n\r\nDey left den, an' we ain't been bothered wid 'em no more.\r\n\r\nI toted water 'fore de war, minded de sheeps, cows and de geese; an' I\r\nain't had many whuppin's neither.

We had our own chickens an' gyarden an' little ways of\r\nmakin' money, but not so much fun.\r\n\r\nWe played cat, which wuz like base ball now, only different.
