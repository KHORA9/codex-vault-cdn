Litt.D.,\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSORS AT THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\n1914\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE IRISH RACE\r\nIN EVERY LAND\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Ireland_:\r\n\r\n      \"All thy life has been a symbol; we can only read a part:\r\n      God will flood thee yet with sunshine for the woes that\r\n            drench thy heart.\"\r\n\r\n      JOHN BOYLE O'REILLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had at first intended that this should be a book without a\r\npreface, and indeed it needs none, for it speaks in no uncertain\r\ntones for itself; but on reconsideration we decided that it would be\r\nmore seemly to give a short explanation of our aim, our motives, and\r\nour methods.\r\n\r\nAs a result of innumerable inquiries which have come to us during our\r\nexperience as educators, we have been forced to the conclusion that\r\nthe performances of the Irish race in many fields of endeavor are\r\nentirely unknown to most people, and that even to the elect they are\r\nnot nearly so well known as they deserve to be. Hence there came to\r\nus the thought of placing on record, in an accessible, comprehensive,\r\nand permanent form, an outline of the whole range of Irish\r\nachievement during the last two thousand years.\r\n\r\nIn undertaking this task we had a twofold motive. In the first place,\r\nwe wished to give to people of Irish birth or descent substantial\r\nreason for that pride of race which we know is in them, by placing in\r\ntheir hands an authoritative and unassailable array of facts as\r\ntelling as any nation in the world can show. Our second motive was\r\nthat henceforward he who seeks to ignore or belittle the part taken\r\nby men and women of Irish birth or blood in promoting the spread of\r\nreligion, civilization, education, culture, and freedom should sin,\r\nnot in ignorance, but against the light, and that from a thousand\r\nquarters at once champions armed with the panoply of knowledge should\r\nbe able to spring to his confutation.\r\n\r\nTo carry out in a satisfactory manner over a field so immense our\r\nlawfully ambitious aim was, as we realized at the outset, not\r\npossible to any two men who are primarily engaged, as we are, in\r\nother work of an exacting nature. Therefore, to render feasible the\r\nexecution of our undertaking, we decided to invite the collaboration\r\nof many scholars and specialists, each of whom could, out of the\r\nfullness of information, speak with authority on some particular\r\nphase of the general subject. We are glad to say that the eminent\r\nwriters to whom we addressed ourselves answered with promptitude and\r\nalacrity to our call, and have supplied us with such a body of\r\nmaterial as to enable us to bring out a book that is absolutely\r\nunique.\r\n\r\nFrom each contributor we asked nothing but a plain verifiable\r\nstatement of facts, and that, we think, is exactly what they have\r\ngiven us, for, while we do not make ourselves personally responsible\r\nfor everything set down in the following pages, we believe that what\r\nstands written therein bears every mark of careful research and of\r\nabsolute reliability.\r\n\r\nAlthough on many of our subjects little more remains to be said than\r\nwhat appears in the text, yet the treatment on the whole does not\r\nclaim to be exhaustive, and therefore each writer has, at our\r\nrequest, appended to his contribution a short and carefully selected\r\nbibliography, so that those who are interested may have a guide for\r\nfurther reading. For our part, we consider these lists of works of\r\nreference to be a highly useful feature.\r\n\r\nIt is a glorious thing for us, who are proud, one of us of his Irish\r\ndescent and the other of his Irish birth, to think that the sons and\r\ndaughters of mother Erin have so conspicuously distinguished\r\nthemselves in such varied spheres of activity in every age and in so\r\nmany lands, and that we were privileged to make public the record of\r\ntheir achievements in a form never before attempted.\r\n\r\nWe have other works in contemplation, and some actually in\r\npreparation, which will go far to strengthen the claims put forward\r\nin this book. In the meantime, we trust that the reception accorded\r\nto it will be such as to encourage us to persevere in making still\r\nbetter known the Glories of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                JOSEPH DUNN\r\n                                                P.J.

Their memory uplifts the Irish heart;\r\nfor no nation, no people, can reproach Ireland with having wronged\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the dawn of the Christian era, we first hear of Ireland from\r\nexternal sources, we learn of it as an island harboring free men,\r\nwhose indomitable love of freedom was hateful to the spirit of\r\nimperial exploitation.\r\n\r\nAgricola's advice to the empire-builders of his day was that Rome\r\nshould \"war down and take possession of Ireland, so that freedom\r\nmight be put out of sight.\"\r\n\r\nIt was to meet this challenge of despotism that the Scotic clans of\r\nAlba turned to their motherland for help, and the sea was \"white with\r\nthe hurrying oars\" of the men of Erin speeding to the call of their\r\nHighland kinsmen, threatened with imperial servitude.\r\n\r\nThe first external record we possess thus makes it clear that when\r\nthe early Irish went forth to carry war abroad, it was not to impose\r\ntheir yoke on other peoples, or to found an empire, but to battle\r\nagainst the Empire of the World in the threatened cause they held so\r\ndear at home.\r\n\r\nIn this early Roman reference to Ireland we get the keynote to all\r\nlater Irish history--a warring down on the one hand, so that freedom\r\nmight be put out of sight; an eternal resistance, on the other, so\r\nthat it might be upheld.\r\n\r\nIt was this struggle that Ireland sought to maintain against every\r\nform of attack, down through Danish, Norman, Tudor, Stuart, and\r\nCromwellian assault, to the larger imperialism of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, when, as Thierry, the historian of the Norman Conquest,\r\ntells us, it still remained the one \"lost cause\" of history that\r\nrefused to admit defeat. \"This indomitable persistency, this faculty\r\nof preserving through centuries of misery the remembrance of lost\r\nliberty and of never despairing of a cause always defeated, always\r\nfatal to those who dared to defend it, is perhaps the strangest and\r\nnoblest example ever given by any nation.\"\r\n\r\nThe resources Ireland opposed to her invaders have been unequal to\r\nthe founding of a great state, but have preserved a great tradition.\r\nThe weakness of Ireland lay in the absence of a central organization,\r\na state machine that could mobilize the national resources to defend\r\nthe national life. That life had to depend for its existence, under\r\nthe stress of prolonged invasion, on the spontaneous patriotism and\r\ncourage of individuals. At times one clan alone, or two clans,\r\nmaintained the struggle. Arrayed against them were all the resources\r\nof a mighty realm--shipping, arms, munitions of war, gold,\r\nstatecraft, a widespread and calculating diplomacy, the prestige of a\r\ngreat Sovereign and a famous Court--and the Irish clan and its\r\nchieftain, by the sheer courage of its members, by their bodily\r\nstrength and hardihood and feats of daring, for years kept the issue\r\nin doubt.\r\n\r\nWhen Hugh O'Neill, leagued with Red Hugh O'Donnell, challenged the\r\nmight of Elizabeth, he had nothing to rely upon but the stout hearts\r\nand arms of the men of Tir-owen and Tir-Conail. Arms and armaments\r\nwere far from Ulster. They could be procured only in Spain or\r\nelsewhere on the continent. English shipping held the sea; the\r\nEnglish mint the coinage. The purse of England, compared to that of\r\nthe Ulster princes, was inexhaustible. Yet for nine years the\r\ncourage, the chivalry, the daring and skill of these northern\r\nclansmen, perhaps 20,000 men in all, held all the might of England at\r\nbay. Had the Spanish king at any time during the contest made good\r\nhis promise to lend effective aid to the Irish princes, O'Neill would\r\nhave driven Elizabeth from Ireland, and a sovereign State would today\r\nbe the guardian of the freedom of the western seas for Europe and the\r\nworld. It took \"the best army in Europe\" and a vast treasure, as Sir\r\nJohn Davies asserted, to conquer two Ulster clans three hundred years\r\nago. The naked valor of the Irishman excelled the armed might of\r\nTudor England; and the struggle that gave the empire of the seas to\r\nBritain was won not in the essay of battle, but in the assay of the\r\nmint.\r\n\r\nIt is this aspect of the Irish fight for freedom that dignifies an\r\notherwise lost cause. Ever defeated, yet undefeated, a\r\nlong-remembering race believes that these native qualities must in\r\nthe end prevail. The battle has been from the first one of manhood\r\nagainst might. The State Papers, the official record of English rule\r\nin Ireland, leave us rarely in doubt. We read in that record that,\r\nwhere the appeal was to the strength or courage of the opposing men,\r\nthe Irish had nothing to fear from English arms.\r\n\r\nThus the Earl of Essex, in a despatch to Elizabeth, explained the\r\nfailure of his great expedition in 1599 against O'Neill and\r\nO'Donnell. \"These rebels ... have (though I do unwillingly confess\r\nit) better bodies and perfecter use of their arms than those men whom\r\nyour Majesty sends over.\" The flight of the Earls in 1607 left\r\nIreland leaderless, with nothing but the bodies and hearts of the\r\npeople to depend on. In 1613 we read, in the same records, a candid\r\nadmission that, although the clan system had been destroyed and the\r\ngreat chiefs expropriated, converted, or driven to flight, the people\r\nstill trusted to their own stout arms and fearless hearts:\r\n\r\n\"The next rebellion, whenever it shall happen, doth threaten more\r\ndanger to the State than any heretofore, when the cities and walled\r\ntowns were always faithful; (1) because they have the same bodies\r\nthey ever had and therein they had and have advantage of us; (2) from\r\ninfancy they have been and are exercised in the use of arms; (3) the\r\nrealm by reason of the long peace was never so full of youths; (4)\r\nthat they are better soldiers than heretofore their continental\r\nemployment in wars abroad assures us, and they do conceive that their\r\nmen are better than ours.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when that \"next rebellion\" came, the great uprising of the\r\noutraged race in 1641, what do we find? Back from the continent sails\r\nthe nephew of the great O'Neill, who had left Ireland a little boy in\r\nthe flight of the Earls, and the dispossessed clansmen, robbed of all\r\nbut their strength of body and heart, gathered to the summons of Owen\r\nRoe.\r\n\r\nAgain it was the same issue: the courage and hardihood of the\r\nIrishman to set against the superior arms, equipment, and wealth of a\r\nunited Britain. Irish valor won the battle; a great state\r\norganization won the campaign. England and Scotland combined to lay\r\nlow a resurgent Ireland; and again the victory was not to the brave\r\nand skilled, but to the longer purse and the implacable mind. Perhaps\r\nthe most vivid testimony to these innate qualities of the Irishman is\r\nto be found in a typically Irish challenge issued in the course of\r\nthis ten years' war from 1641 to 1651. The document has a lasting\r\ninterest, for it displays not only the \"better body\" of the Irishman,\r\nbut something of his better heart and chivalry of soul.\r\n\r\nOne Parsons, an English settler in Ireland, had written to a friend\r\nto say, among other things, that the head of a colonel of an Irish\r\nregiment then in the field against the English would not be allowed\r\nto stick long on its shoulders. The letter was intercepted by the\r\nvery regiment itself, and a captain in it, Felim O'Molloy, wrote back\r\nto Parsons:\r\n\r\n\"I will doe this, if you please. I will pick out 60 men and fight\r\nagainst 100 of your choise men, if you do but pitch your campe one\r\nmile out of your towne, and then, if you have the victory, you may\r\nthreaten my colonel; otherwise do not reckon your chickens before\r\nthey be hatched.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this same spirit of daring, this innate belief in his own\r\nmanhood, that for three hundred years made every Irishman the\r\ncustodian of his country's honor.\r\n\r\nAn Irish state had not been born; that battle had still to be fought;\r\nbut the romantic effort to achieve it reveals ever an unstained\r\nrecord of personal courage. Freedom has not come to Ireland; it has\r\nbeen \"warred down and kept out of sight\"; but it has been kept in the\r\nIrish heart, from Brian Boru to Robert Emmet, by a long tale of blood\r\nshed always in the same cause. Freedom is kept alive in man's blood\r\nonly by the shedding of that blood. It was this they were seeking,\r\nthose splendid \"scorners of death\", the lads and young men of Mayo,\r\nwho awaited with a fearless joy the advance of the English army fresh\r\nfrom the defeat of Humbert in 1798. Then, if ever, Irishmen might\r\nhave run from a victorious and pitiless enemy, who having captured\r\nthe French general and murdered, in cold blood, the hundreds of\r\nKillala peasants who were with his colors, were now come to Killala\r\nitself to wreak vengeance on the last stronghold of Irish rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe ill-led and half-armed peasants, the last Irishmen in Ireland to\r\nstand in open, pitched fight for their country's freedom, went to\r\nmeet the army of General Lake, as the Protestant bishop who saw them\r\nsays, \"running upon death with as little appearance of reflection or\r\nconcern as if they were hastening to a show.\"\r\n\r\nThe influences that begot this reverence for freedom lie in the\r\nisland itself no less than in the remote ancestry of the people.\r\nWhoever looks upon Ireland cannot conceive it as the parent of any\r\nbut freemen. Climate and soil here unite to tell man that\r\nbrotherhood, and not domination, constitutes the only nobility for\r\nthose who call this fair shore their motherland. The Irish struggle\r\nfor liberty owes as much, perhaps, to the continuing influence of the\r\nsame lakes and rivers and the same mountains as to the survival of\r\nany political fragments of the past. Irish history is inseparably the\r\nhistory of the land, rather than of a race; and in this it offers us\r\na spectacle of a continuing national unity that long-continuing\r\ndisaster has not been able wholly to efface or wholly to disrupt.\r\n\r\nTo discover the Europe that existed before Rome we must turn to the\r\nEast, Greece, and to the West, Ireland.\r\n\r\nIreland alone among western lands preserves the recorded tradition,\r\nthe native history, the continuity of mind, and, until yesterday, of\r\nspeech and song, that connect the half of Europe with its ancestral\r\npast. For early Europe was very largely Celtic Europe, and nowhere\r\ncan we trace the continuous influence of Celtic culture and idealism,\r\ncoming down to us from a remote past, save in Ireland only.\r\n\r\nTo understand the intellect of pre-Roman Gaul, of Spain, of Portugal,\r\nand largely of Germany, and even of Italy, we must go to Ireland.\r\nWhoever visits Spain or Portugal, to investigate the past of those\r\ncountries, will find that the record stops where Rome began. Take\r\nEngland in further illustration. The first record the inhabitants of\r\nEngland have of the past of their island comes from Roman invasion.\r\nThey know of Boadicea, of Cassivelaunus, the earliest figures in\r\ntheir history, from what a foreign destroyer tells them in an alien\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nAll the early life of Celtiberians and Lusitanians has passed away\r\nfrom the record of human endeavor, save only where we find it\r\nrecorded by the Italian invaders in their own speech, and in such\r\nterms as imperial exploitation ever prescribes for its own\r\nadvancement and the belittlement of those it assails. Ireland alone\r\namong all western nations knows her own past, from the very dawn of\r\nhistory and before the romance of Romulus began, down to the present\r\nday, in the tongue of her own island people and in the light of her\r\nown native mind. Early Irish history is not the record of the\r\nclan-strivings of a petty and remote population, far from the centre\r\nof civilization. It is the authentic story of all western\r\ncivilization before the warm solvent of Mediterranean blood and iron\r\nmelted and moulded it into another and rigid shape.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman called O'Neill, O'Brien, O'Donnell, steps out of a past\r\nwell-nigh co-eval with the heroisms and tragedies that uplifted\r\nGreece and laid Troy in ashes, and swept the Mediterranean with an\r\nOdyssey of romance that still gives its name to each chief island,\r\ncape, and promontory of the mother sea of Europe. Ireland, too, steps\r\nout of a story just as old. Well nigh every hill or mountain, every\r\nlake or river, bears the name today it bore a thousand, two thousand,\r\nyears ago, and one recording some dramatic human or semi-divine\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nThe songs of the Munster and Connacht poets of the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries gave to every cottage in the land the ownership\r\nas well as the tale of an heroic ancestry. They linked the Ireland of\r\nyesterday with the Ireland of Finn and Oscar, of Diarmid and Grainne,\r\nof Deirdre and the Sons of Usnech, of Cuchulainn the Hound of Ulster.\r\nA people bred on such soul-stirring tales as these, linked by a\r\nlanguage \"the most expressive of any spoken on earth\" in thought and\r\nverse and song with the very dawn of their history, wherein there\r\nmoved, as familiar figures, men with the attributes of gods--great in\r\nbattle, grand in danger, strong in loving, vehement in death--such a\r\npeople could never be vulgar, could never be mean, but must repeat,\r\nin their own time and in their own manhood, actions and efforts thus\r\nascribed as a vital part of their very origin. Hence the inspiration\r\nthat gave the name of Fenian, in the late nineteenth century, to a\r\nband of men who sought to achieve by arms the freedom of Ireland. The\r\nlaw of the Fenian of the days of Marcus Aurelius was the law of the\r\nFenian in the reign of Victoria--to give all--mind, body, and\r\nstrength of purpose--to the defense of his country, \"to speak truth\r\nand harbor no greed in his heart.\"\r\n\r\nSome there are who may deny to Finn and his Fenians of the second and\r\nthird centuries corporeal existence; yet nothing is surer than that\r\nIreland claims these ancestral embodiments of an heroic tradition by\r\na far surer title of native record than gives to the Germans\r\nArminius, to the Gauls, Ariovistus, to the British, Caractacus. This\r\nconception of a national life, one with the land itself, was very\r\nclear to the ancient Irish, just as it has been and is the foundation\r\nof all later national effort.\r\n\r\n\"If ever the idea of nationality becomes the subject of a thorough\r\nand honest study, it will be seen that among all the peoples of\r\nantiquity, not excluding the Hellenes and the Hebrews, the Irish held\r\nthe clearest and most conscious and constant grasp of that idea; and\r\nthat their political divisions, instead of disproving the existence\r\nof the idea, in their case intensely strengthen the proof of its\r\nexistence and emphasize its power.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the remarkable absence of insular exclusiveness,\r\nnotwithstanding their geographical position, serves to bring their\r\nsense of nationality into higher relief.\r\n\r\nThough pride of race is evident in the dominant Gaelic stock, their\r\nnational sentiment centres not in the race, but altogether in the\r\ncountry, which is constantly personified and made the object of a\r\nsort of cult.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that just as the Brehon Laws are the laws of\r\nIreland without distinction of province or district; as the language\r\nof Irish literature is the language of Ireland without distinction of\r\ndialects; as the Dindshenchus contains the topographical legends of\r\nall parts of Ireland, and the Festilogies commemorate the saints of\r\nall Ireland; so the Irish chronicles from first to last are histories\r\nof the Irish nation. The true view of the Book of Invasions is that\r\nit is the epic of Irish Nationality.\" (Professor Eoin MacNeill, in a\r\nletter to Mrs. A.S. Green, January, 1914.)\r\n\r\nThe \"Book of Invasions\", which Professor MacNeill here speaks of, was\r\ncompiled a thousand years ago. To write the history of later Ireland\r\nis merely to prolong the \"Book of Invasions\", and thus bring the epic\r\nof Irish resistance down to our own day. All Irish valor and\r\nchivalry, whether of soul or of body, have been directed for a\r\nthousand years to this same end. It was for this that Sarsfield died\r\nat Landen no less than Brian at Clontarf. The monarch of Ireland at\r\nthe head of a great Irish army driving back the leagued invaders from\r\nthe shores of Dublin Bay in 1014, and the exiled leader in 1693,\r\nheading the charge that routed King William's cause in the\r\nNetherlands, fell on one and the same battlefield. They fought\r\nagainst the invader of Ireland.\r\n\r\nWe are proudly told that the sun never sets on the British Empire.\r\nWherever an Irishman has fought in the name of Ireland it has not\r\nbeen to acquire fortune, land, or fame, but to give all, even life\r\nitself, not to found an empire, but to strike a blow for an ancient\r\nland and assert the cause of a swordless people. Wherever Irishmen\r\nhave gone, in exile or in fight, they have carried this image of\r\nIreland with them. The cause of Ireland has found a hundred fields of\r\nforeign fame, where the dying Irishman might murmur with Sarsfield,\r\n\"Would that this blood were shed for Ireland\", and history records\r\nthe sacrifice as made in no other cause.\r\n\r\nIreland, too, owns an empire on which the sun never sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nSigerson: Bards of the Gael and Gall; O'Callaghan: History of the\r\nIrish Brigades; Mitchel: Life of Hugh O'Neill; Green: The Making of\r\nIreland and its Undoing, Irish Nationality, The Old Irish World;\r\nTaylor: Life of Owen Roe O'Neill; Todhunter: Life of Patrick\r\nSarsfield; Hyde: Love Songs of Connacht, Religious Songs of Connacht;\r\nO'Grady: Bog of Stars, Flight of the Eagle; Ferguson: Hibernian\r\nNights' Entertainment; Mitchel: History of Ireland, in continuation\r\nof MacGeoghegan's History.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF SAINTS AND SCHOLARS\r\n\r\nBy CANON D'ALTON, M.R.I.A., LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the natives of Britain and Scotland, the Irish in\r\npre-Christian times were not brought into contact with Roman\r\ninstitutions or Roman culture. In consequence they created and\r\ndeveloped a civilization of their own that was in some respects\r\nwithout equal. They were far advanced in the knowledge of metal-work\r\nand shipbuilding; they engaged in commerce; they loved music and had\r\nan acquaintance with letters; and when disputes arose among them,\r\nthese were settled in duly constituted courts of justice, presided\r\nover by a trained lawyer, called a brehon, instead of being settled\r\nby the stern arbitrament of force. Druidism was their pagan creed.\r\nThey believed in the immortality and in the transmigration of souls;\r\nthey worshipped the sun and moon, and they venerated mountains,\r\nrivers, and wells; and it would be difficult to find any ministers of\r\nreligion who were held in greater awe than the Druids.\r\n\r\nCommerce and war brought the Irish into contact with Britain and the\r\ncontinent, and thus was Christianity gradually introduced into the\r\nisland. Though its progress at first was not rapid, there were, by\r\n431, several Christian churches in existence, and in that year\r\nPalladius, a Briton and a bishop, was sent by Pope Celestine to the\r\nIrish who already believed in Christ. Discouraged and a failure,\r\nPalladius returned to Britain after a brief stay on his mission, and\r\nthen, in 432, the same Pope sent St. Patrick, who became the Apostle\r\nof Ireland.\r\n\r\nBecause of the great work he did, St. Patrick is one of the prominent\r\nfigures of history; and yet, to such an extent has the dust of time\r\nsettled down on his life and acts that the place and year of his\r\nbirth, the schools in which he was educated, and the year of his\r\ndeath, are all matters of dispute. There is, however, no good reason\r\nto depart from the traditional account, which is, that the Apostle\r\nwas born at Dumbarton in Scotland, in the year 372; that in 388 he\r\nwas captured by the Irish king Niall, who had gone on a plundering\r\nraid into Scotland; that he was brought to Ireland and sold as a\r\nslave, and that as such he served a pagan chief named Milcho who\r\nlived in what is now the county of Antrim; that from Antrim he\r\nescaped and went back to his own country; that he had many visions\r\nurging him to return to Ireland and preach the Gospel there; that,\r\nbelieving these were from God, he went to France, and there was\r\neducated and ordained priest, and later consecrated bishop; and then,\r\naccompanied by several ecclesiastics, he was sent to Ireland.\r\n\r\nFrom Wicklow, where he landed, he proceeded north and endeavored, but\r\nin vain, to convert his old pagan master Milcho; thence he proceeded\r\nsouth by Downpatrick and Dundalk to Slane in Meath, where, in sight\r\nof Tara, the high-king's seat, he lighted the paschal fire. At Tara\r\nhe confounded the Druids in argument, baptized the high-king and the\r\nchief poet; and then, turning north and west, he crossed the Shannon\r\ninto Connacht, where he spent seven years. From Connacht he passed\r\ninto Donegal, and thence through Tyrone and Antrim, after which he\r\nentered Munster, and remained there seven years. Finally, he returned\r\nto Armagh, which he made his episcopal see, and died at Saul, near\r\nDownpatrick, in 493.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick wrote two short works, both of which have survived, his\r\n_Confession_ and his _Epistle to Coroticus_. In neither are there any\r\ngraces of style, and the Latin is certainly not that of Cicero or\r\nLivy. But in the _Confession_ the character of the author himself is\r\ncompletely revealed--his piety, his zeal, his self-sacrifice, his\r\ncourage in face of every danger and every trial. Not less remarkable\r\nwas the skill with which he handled men and used pagan institutions\r\nfor the purposes of Christianity; and equally so was the success with\r\nwhich his bloodless apostolate was crowned.\r\n\r\nOne great difficulty which St. Patrick had was to provide the people\r\nwith a native ministry. At first he selected the chief men--princes,\r\nbrehons, bards--and these, with little training and little education,\r\nhe ordained. Thus, slenderly equipped with knowledge, the priest,\r\nwith his ritual, missal, and a catechism, and the bishop, with his\r\ncrozier and bell, went forth to do battle for the Lord. This\r\ncondition of things was soon ended. In 450 a college was founded at\r\nArmagh, which in a short time grew to be a famous school, and\r\nattracted students from afar. Other schools were founded in the fifth\r\ncentury, at Noendrum, Louth, and Kildare. In the sixth century arose\r\nthe famous monastic schools of Clonfert, Clonard, Clonmacnois, Arran,\r\nand Bangor; while the seventh century saw the rise of Glendalough and\r\nLismore.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick was educated in Gaul, at the monasteries of Marmoutier\r\nand Lerins; and, perhaps as a result, the monastic character of the\r\nearly Irish church was one of its outstanding features; moreover it\r\nwas to the prevalence of the monastic spirit, the desire for solitude\r\nand meditation, that so many of the great monastic establishments\r\nowed their existence. Fleeing from society and its attractions, and\r\nwishing only for solitude and austerity, some holy man sought out a\r\nlonely retreat, and there lived a life of mortification and prayer.\r\nOthers came to share his poverty and vigils; a grant of land was then\r\nobtained from the ruling chief, the holy man became abbot and his\r\nfollowers his monks; and a religious community was formed destined\r\nsoon to acquire fame. It was thus that St. Finnian established\r\nClonard on the banks of the Boyne, and St. Kieran, Clonmacnois by the\r\nwaters of the Shannon; and thus did St. Enda make the wind-swept\r\nIsles of Arran the home and the resting place of so many saints.\r\nBefore the close of the sixth century, 3,000 monks followed the rule\r\nof St. Corngall at Bangor; and in the seventh century, St. Carthage\r\nmade Lismore famous and St. Kevin attracted pious men from afar to\r\nhis lonely retreat in the picturesque valley of Glendalough.\r\n\r\nAnd there were holy women as well as holy men in Ireland. St. Brigid\r\nwas held in such honor that she is often called the Mary of the Gael.\r\nEven in St. Patrick's day, she had founded a convent at Kildare,\r\nbeside which was a monastery of which St. Conleth was superior; and\r\nshe founded many other convents in addition to that at Kildare. Her\r\nexample was followed by St. Ita, St. Fanchea, and many others; and if\r\nat the close of the sixth century there were few districts which had\r\nnot monasteries and monks, there were few also which had not convents\r\nand nuns.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. Fired with missionary zeal, many men left Ireland\r\nto plant the faith in distant lands. Thus did St. Columcille settle\r\nin Iona, whence he converted the Picts. Under his successors, St.\r\nAidan and his friends went south to Lindisfarne to convert\r\nNorthumbria in England; and the ninth abbot of Iona was the saintly\r\nAdamnan, whose biography of St. Columcille has been declared by\r\ncompetent authority to be the best of its kind of which the whole\r\nMiddle Ages can boast. Nor must it be forgotten that the monasteries\r\nof Luxeuil and Bobbio owed their origin to St. Columbanus; that St.\r\nGall gave his name to a town and canton in Switzerland; that St.\r\nFridolin labored on the Rhine and St. Fursey on the Marne; and that\r\nSt. Cathaldus was Bishop of Tarentum, and is still venerated as the\r\npatron of that Italian see.\r\n\r\nAnd if we would know what was the character of the schools in which\r\nthese men were trained, we have only to remember that Colgu, who had\r\nbeen educated at Clonmacnois, was the master of Alcuin; that Dicuil\r\nthe Geographer came from the same school; that Cummian, Abbot and\r\nBishop of Clonfert, combated the errors about the paschal computation\r\nwith an extent of learning and a wealth of knowledge amazing in a\r\nmonk of the seventh century; and that at the close of the eighth\r\ncentury two Irishmen went to the court of Charlemagne and were\r\ndescribed by a monk of St. Gall as \"men incomparably skilled in human\r\nlearning\". The once pagan Ireland had by that time become a citadel\r\nof Christianity, and was rightfully called the School of the West,\r\nthe Island of Saints and Scholars.\r\n\r\nWith this state of progress and prosperity the Danes played sad\r\nhavoc. Animated with the fiercest pagan fanaticism, they turned with\r\nfury against Christianity, and especially against monks and religious\r\nfoundations. Armagh, Clonmacnois, Bangor, Kildare, and many other\r\ngreat monastic establishments thus fell before their fury. Ignorance,\r\nneglect of religion, and corruption of manners followed, and from the\r\neighth to the twelfth century there was a noted falling off in the\r\nnumber of Irish scholars. At home indeed were Cormac and Maelmurra,\r\nO'Hartigan and O'Flynn, and abroad was John Scotus Erigena, whose\r\nlearning was so great that it excited astonishment even at Rome. The\r\nlove of learning and zeal for religion lived on through this long\r\nperiod of accumulated disasters. After the triumph of Brian Boru at\r\nClontarf, there was a distinct revival of piety and learning; and,\r\nwhen a century of turmoil followed Brian's fall and religion again\r\nsuffered, nothing was wanted to bring the people back to a sense of\r\ntheir duty but the energy and reforming zeal of St. Malachy.\r\n\r\nGerald Barry, the notorious Anglo-Norman, who visited Ireland towards\r\nthe close of the twelfth century, has been convicted out of his own\r\nmouth when he states that Ireland was a barbarous nation when his\r\npeople came there. He forgot that a people who could illuminate the\r\nBook of Kells and build Cormac's Chapel could not be called savages,\r\nnor could a church be lost to a sense of decency and dignity that\r\nnumbered among its children such a man as St. Laurence O'Toole.\r\nAbuses there were, it is true, consequent on long continued war,\r\nthough these abuses were increased rather than lessened by the coming\r\nof the Anglo-Normans, and to such an extent that for more than two\r\ncenturies there is not a single great name among Irish scholars\r\nexcept Duns Scotus.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Duns Scotus was European, and the Subtle Doctor, as he\r\nwas called, became the great glory of the Franciscan, as his rival\r\nSt. Thomas was the great glory of the Dominican, order. But he left\r\nno successor, and from his death, at the opening of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, till the seventeenth century the number of Irish scholars or\r\nrecognized Irish saints was small. Yet, in the midst of disorders\r\nwithin, and despite oppression from without, at no time did the love\r\nof learning disappear in Ireland; nor was there ever in the Irish\r\nchurch either heresy or schism.\r\n\r\nThe attempted reformation by Henry VIII and his daughter Elizabeth\r\nproduced martyrs like O'Hurley and O'Hely; and there were many more\r\nmartyrs in the time of the Stuarts, and especially under the short\r\nbut sanguinary rule of Cromwell.\r\n\r\nThose were the days of the penal laws, when they who clung to the old\r\nreligion suffered much. But nothing could shake their faith; neither\r\nthe proclamations of Elizabeth and James, the massacres of Cromwell,\r\nnor the ferocious proscriptions of the eighteenth century. The priest\r\nsaid Mass, though his crime was punishable by death, and the people\r\nheard Mass, though theirs also was a criminal offence; and the\r\nschoolmaster, driven from the school, taught under a sheltering\r\nhedge. The clerical student, denied education at home, crossed the\r\nsea, to be educated at Louvain or Salamanca or Seville, and then,\r\nperhaps loaded with academic honors, he returned home to face poverty\r\nand persecution and even death. The Catholic masses, socially\r\nostracised, degraded, and impoverished, shut out from every avenue to\r\nambition or enterprise, deprived of every civil right, knowing\r\nnothing of law except when it oppressed them and nothing of\r\ngovernment except when it struck them down, yet clung to the religion\r\nin which they were born. And when, in the latter half of the\r\neighteenth century, the tide turned and the first dawn of toleration\r\nappeared on the horizon, it was found that the vast majority of the\r\npeople were unchanged, and that, after two centuries of the most\r\nrelentless persecution since the days of Diocletian, Ireland was, in\r\nfaith and practice, a strongly Catholic nation still.\r\n\r\nOn a soil constantly wet with the blood and tears of its children, it\r\nwould be vain to expect that scholarship could flourish. And yet the\r\nperiod had its distinguished Irish scholars both at home and abroad.\r\nAt Louvain, in the sixteenth century, were Lombard and Creagh, who\r\nboth became Archbishops of Armagh, and O'Hurley who became Archbishop\r\nof Cashel. An even greater scholar than these was Luke Wadding, the\r\neminent Franciscan who founded the convent of St. Isidore at Rome. At\r\nLouvain was John Colgan, a Franciscan like Wadding, a man who did\r\nmuch for Irish ecclesiastical history. And at home in Ireland, as\r\nparish priest of Tybrid in Tipperary, was the celebrated Dr. Geoffrey\r\nKeating the historian, once a student at Salamanca. John Lynch, the\r\nrenowned opponent of Gerald Barry the Welshman, was Archdeacon of\r\nTuam. And in the ruined Franciscan monastery of Donegal, the Four\r\nMasters, aided and encouraged by the Friars, labored long and\r\npatiently, and finally completed the work which we all know as the\r\n_Annals of the Four Masters_. This work, originally written in Irish,\r\nremained in manuscript in Louvain till the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, when it was edited and translated into English by John\r\nO'Donovan, one of Ireland's greatest Irish scholars, with an ability\r\nand completeness quite worthy of the original.\r\n\r\nOn the Anglo-Irish side there were also some great names, and\r\nespecially in the domain of history, notably Stanyhurst and Hammer,\r\nMoryson and Campion and Davies, and, above all, Ussher and Ware.\r\nJames Ware died in 1666, and though a Protestant and an official of\r\nthe Protestant government, and living in Ireland in an intolerant age\r\nand in an atmosphere charged with religious rancor, he was, to his\r\ncredit be it said, to a large extent free from bigotry. He dealt with\r\nhistory and antiquities, and wrote in no party spirit, wishing only\r\nto be fair and impartial, and to set out the truth as he found it.\r\nJames Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, was a much abler man and a much\r\ngreater scholar than Ware. His capacity for research, his profound\r\nscholarship, the variety and extent of his learning raised him far\r\nabove his co-religionists, and he has been rightly called the Great\r\nLuminary by the Irish Protestant church. It is regrettable that his\r\nfine intellect was darkened by bigotry and intolerance.\r\n\r\nFar different was the character of another Protestant bishop, the\r\ngreat Berkeley, of Cloyne, a patriot, a philosopher, and a scholar,\r\nwho afterwards left money and books for a scholarship, which is still\r\nin existence, at the then infant Yale College in New England. He\r\nlived in the first half of the eighteenth century, when the whole\r\nmachinery of government was ruthlessly used to crush the Catholics.\r\nBut Berkeley had little sympathy with the penal laws; he had words of\r\nkindness for the Catholics, and undoubtedly wished them well. Nor\r\nmust Swift be forgotten, for though he took little pride in being an\r\nIrishman, he hated and despised those who oppressed Ireland, and is\r\nrightly regarded as one of the greatest of her sons.\r\n\r\nThe short period during which Grattan's parliament existed was one of\r\ngreat prosperity. It was then that Maynooth College was established\r\nfor the education of the Irish priesthood. But Catholics, though free\r\nto set up schools, were still shut out from the honors and emoluments\r\nof Trinity College, the one university at that time in Ireland.\r\nStill, Charles O'Connor, MacGeoghegan, and O'Flaherty were great\r\nCatholic scholars in the latter part of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn the following century, while Protestant ascendancy was still\r\nmaintained, the Catholics had greater scope. Away back in the days of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, Campion found Latin widely spoken among the\r\npeasantry, and Father Mooney met country lads familiar with Virgil\r\nand Homer. In 1670, Petty had a similar story to tell, in spite of\r\nall the savageries of Cromwell and the ruin which necessarily\r\nfollowed. And in the eighteenth century the schoolmaster, though a\r\nprice was set on his head, was still active. With an inherited love\r\nof learning, the Irish in the nineteenth century would have made\r\nrapid progress had they been rich. But their impoverishment by the\r\npenal laws made it impossible for them to set up an effective system\r\nof primary education, and until the national school system came into\r\nexistence in 1831, they had to rely on the hedge-schools. Secondary\r\neducation fared better, for the bishops, relying with confidence on\r\nthe generosity of their flocks, were soon able to establish diocesan\r\ncolleges. And in higher education, equally determined efforts were\r\nmade by the establishment of the Catholic University under Cardinal\r\nNewman. But in this field of intellectual effort, in spite of the\r\nenergy and zeal of the bishops, in spite of the great generosity of\r\nthe people, so many of whom were poor, and in spite of the fame of\r\nNewman, it is failure rather than success which the historian has to\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nNor has the love of the Irish for religion, any more than their love\r\nof learning, been lessened or enfeebled by time. The mountain side as\r\nthe place for Mass in the penal days gradually gave way to the rude\r\nstone church without steeple or bell; and when steeple and bell\r\nceased to be proscribed, and the people were left free to erect\r\nsuitable houses of sacrifice and prayer, the fine churches of the\r\nnineteenth century began gradually to appear. The unfettered exercise\r\nof freedom of religious worship, the untiring efforts of a zealous\r\nclergy and episcopate, the unstinted support of a people, who out of\r\ntheir poverty grudged nothing to God or to God's house, formed an\r\nirresistible combination, and all over the country beautiful churches\r\nare now to be found.\r\n\r\nIn every diocese in Ireland, with scarcely an exception, there is now\r\na stately cathedral to perpetuate the renown of the patron saint of\r\nthat diocese, and even parish churches have been built not unworthy\r\nto be the churches of an ancient see. At Armagh, a cathedral has been\r\nbuilt which does honor to Irish architecture, and worthily\r\ncommemorates the life and labors of St. Patrick, the founder of the\r\nprimatial see; at Thurles, a cathedral stands, the chief church of\r\nthe southern province, statelier far than any which ever stood on the\r\nRock of Cashel; at Tuam, a noble building, associated with the memory\r\nof John MacHale, the Lion of the Fold of Judah, perpetuates the name\r\nof St. Jarlath; at Queenstown, the traveller, going to America or\r\nreturning from it to the old land, has his attention attracted to the\r\nsplendid cathedral pile sacred to St. Colman, the patron saint of the\r\ndiocese of Cloyne; and if we would see how splendid even a parish\r\nchurch may be, let us visit the beautiful church in Drogheda,\r\ndedicated to the memory of Oliver Plunkett.\r\n\r\nNor are these things the only evidence we have that zeal for religion\r\namong the Irish has survived centuries of persecution. Columbanus and\r\nColumcille have still their successors, eager and ready as they were\r\nto bring the blessings of the Gospel to distant lands. In recent\r\nyears an Irish-born Archbishop of Sydney has been succeeded by an\r\nIrish-born Archbishop; an Irishman rules the metropolitan see of\r\nAdelaide; and an Irish-born Archbishop of Melbourne has as his\r\ncoadjutor a former president of the College of Maynooth. In South\r\nAfrica, the work of preaching and teaching and ruling the church is\r\nlargely the work of Irish-born men. In the great Republic of the West\r\nthe three cardinal-archbishops at the head of the Catholic Church\r\nhave the distinctively Irish names of Gibbons and Farley and\r\nO'Connell; and in every diocese throughout the United States the\r\nproportion of priests of Irish birth or descent is large.\r\n\r\nNor must the poorer Irish be forgotten. How much does the Catholic\r\nChurch, both in Ireland and in America, owe to the generosity of\r\nIrish-American laborers and servant girls! Out of their scanty and\r\nhard-earned pay they have contributed much not only towards the\r\nbuilding of the plain wooden church in the rural parishes, but also\r\nof the stately cathedrals of American cities. And many a church in\r\nold Ireland owes its completion and its adornment to the dollars\r\ngiven by the poor but generous Irish exiles.\r\n\r\nAnd if the zeal of the Irish for religion has thus survived to the\r\ntwentieth century, so also in an equally remarkable degree has their\r\nzeal for learning. We have evidence of this in the numerous primary\r\nschools in every parish, filled with eager pupils and presided over\r\nby hard working teachers; in the colleges where the sciences and the\r\nclassics are studied with the same energy as in the ancient monastic\r\nschools; and in Maynooth College, which is the foremost\r\necclesiastical college in the world. And if there are now new\r\nuniversities, the National and the Queen's, sturdy and vigorous in\r\ntheir youth, this does not imply that Trinity College suffers from\r\nthe decreptitude of age. For among those whom she sent forth in\r\nrecent times are Dowden and Mahaffy and Lecky, to name but three, and\r\nthese would do credit to any university in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find in any age of Irish history a greater\r\npulpit orator than the famous Dominican, Father Tom Burke, or a more\r\ndelightful essayist than Father Joseph Farrell; and who has depicted\r\nIrish clerical life more faithfully than the late Canon Sheehan,\r\nwhose fame as a novelist has crossed continents and oceans? O'Connell\r\nwas a great orator as well as a great political leader, and Dr. Doyle\r\nand Archbishop John MacHale were scholars as well as statesmen and\r\nbishops. We have thus an unbroken chain of great names, a series of\r\nIrishmen whom the succeeding ages have brought forth to enlighten and\r\ninstruct lesser men; and Ireland, in the twentieth century, is not\r\nless attached to religion and learning than she was when Clonmacnois\r\nflourished and the saintly Carthage ruled at Lismore.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nJoyce: Social History of Ancient Ireland (Dublin, 1903); Lanigan:\r\nEcclesiastical History of Ireland (Dublin, 1822); Healy: Ireland's\r\nAncient Schools and Scholars (Dublin, 1896), Life and Writings of St.\r\nPatrick (Dublin, 1905); Bury: St. Patrick and his Place in History\r\n(London, 1905); Ussher's Works (Dublin, 1847); Reeves: Adamnan's Life\r\nof St. Columba (Dublin, 1851); Worsae: The Danes in Ireland (London,\r\n1852); Moran: Essays on the Early Irish Church (Dublin, 1864);\r\nStokes: Ireland and the Anglo-Norman Church (London, 1897); Mant:\r\nHistory of the Church of Ireland (London, 1841); Bagwell: Ireland\r\nunder the Tudors (London, 1885-90); Moran: Persecutions under the\r\nPuritans (Callan, 1903); Murphy: Our Martyrs (Dublin, 1896); Meehan:\r\nFranciscan Monasteries of the Seventeenth Century (Dublin, 1870);\r\nLecky: History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century (London, 1902);\r\nO'Connell's Correspondence (London, 1888); Wyse: History of the\r\nCatholic Association (London, 1829); Doyle: Letters on the State of\r\nIreland (Dublin, 1826); O'Rorke: Irish Famine (Dublin, 1902); Gavan\r\nDuffy: Young Ireland (London, 1880); Plunkett: Ireland in the New\r\nCentury (London, 1904); O'Riordan: Catholicity and Progress in\r\nIreland (London, 1905); MacCaffery: History of the Church in the\r\nNineteenth Century (Dublin, 1909); Healy: Centenary History of\r\nMaynooth College (Dublin, 1905); D'Alton: History of Ireland (London,\r\n1910).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH MONKS IN EUROPE\r\n\r\nBy Rev. Columba Edmonds, O.S.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick's work in Ireland was chiefly concerned with preaching\r\nthe faith and establishing monasteries which served as centres of\r\neducation. The great success that attended these efforts earned for\r\nIreland the double title of Island of Saints and a Second Thebaid.\r\n\r\nThe monastic institutions organized by St. Patrick were characterized\r\nfrom their commencement by an apostolic zeal that knew no bounds.\r\nSufficient scope was not to be found at home, so it was impatient to\r\ndiffuse itself abroad.\r\n\r\nSCOTLAND: Hence in the year 563 St. Columcille, a Donegal native of\r\nroyal descent, accompanied by twelve companions, crossed the sea in\r\ncurrachs of wickerwork and hides, and sought to land in Caledonia.\r\nThey reached the desolate Isle of Iona on the day preceding\r\nWhitsunday.\r\n\r\nMany years before, colonies of Irishmen had settled along the western\r\nparts of the present Scotland. The settlement north of the Clyde\r\nreceived the name of the Kingdom of Dalriada. These Dalriadan Irish\r\nwere Christian at least in name, but their neighbors in the Pictish\r\nHighlands were still pagans. Columcille's apostolate was to be among\r\nboth these peoples. Adamnan says that Columcille came to Caledonia\r\n\"for the love of Christ's name\", and well did his after-life prove\r\nthe truth of this statement. He had attained his forty-fourth year\r\nwhen King Conall, his kinsman, bestowed Iona upon him and his\r\nbrethren. The island, situated between the Dalriadans and the Picts\r\nof the Highlands, was conveniently placed for missionary work. A\r\nnumerous community recruited from Ireland, with Columcille as its\r\nAbbot, soon caused Iona to become a flourishing centre from which men\r\ncould go forth to preach Christianity. Monasteries and hermitages\r\nrapidly sprang up in the adjacent islands and on the mainland. These,\r\ntogether with the Columban foundations in Ireland, formed one great\r\nreligious federation, in which the Celtic apostles of the northern\r\nraces were formed under the influence of the holy founder.\r\n\r\nSt. Columcille recognized the need of securing permanence for his\r\nwork by obtaining the conversion of the Pictish rulers, and thus he\r\ndid not hesitate to approach King Brude in his castle on the banks of\r\nthe River Ness. St. Comgall and St. Canice were Columcille's\r\ncompanions on his journey through the great glen, now famous for the\r\nCaledonian Canal. The royal convert Brude was baptized, and by\r\ndegrees the people followed the example set them. Opposition,\r\nhowever, was keen and aggressive, and it came from the official\r\nrepresentatives of Pictish paganism--the Druids.\r\n\r\nSuccess, too, attended Columcille's ministrations among the\r\nDalriadans, and on the death of their king, Aidan Gabhran, who\r\nsucceeded to the throne, sought regal consecration from the hands of\r\nColumcille. In 597 the saint died, but not before he had won a whole\r\nkingdom to Christ and covered the land with churches and monasteries.\r\nToday his name is held in honor not by Irishmen alone, but by the\r\nCatholics and non-Catholics of the land of his adoption.\r\n\r\nThere are other saints who either labored in person with Columcille\r\nor perpetuated the work he accomplished in Caledonia; and their names\r\nadd to the glory of Ireland, their birth-land. Thus St. Moluag (592)\r\nconverted the people of Lismore, and afterwards died at Rosemarkie;\r\nSt. Drostan, St. Columcille's friend and disciple, established the\r\nfaith in Aberdeenshire and became abbot of Deer; St. Kieran (548)\r\nevangelized Kintyre; St. Mun (635) labored in Argyleshire; St. Buite\r\n(521) did the same in Pictland; St. Maelrubha (722) preached in\r\nRoss-shire; St. Modan and St. Machar benefited the dwellers on the\r\nwestern and eastern coasts respectively; and St. Fergus in the eighth\r\ncentury became apostle of Forfar, Buchan, and Caithness.\r\n\r\nDISTANT ISLANDS: But Irish monks were mariners as well as apostles.\r\nTheir hide-covered currachs were often launched in the hope of\r\ndiscovering solitudes in the ocean. Adamnan records that Baitan set\r\nout with others in search of a desert in the sea. St. Cormac sought a\r\nsimilar retreat and arrived at the Orkneys. St. Molaise's holy isle\r\nguards Lamlash Bay, off Arran. The island retreats of the Bass,\r\nInchkeith, May, and Inchcolm, in the Firth of Forth, are associated\r\nwith the Irish saints Baldred, Adamnan, Adrian, and Columcille. St.\r\nMaccaldus, a native of Down, became bishop of the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nRemarkable, too, is the fact that Irish monks sailed by way of the\r\nFaroe Islands to distant Iceland. These sailor-clerics, who settled\r\non the southeast of the island, were spoken of by later Norwegians as\r\n\"papar.\" After their departure--they were probably driven away by\r\nNorwegian pagans--these Icelandic apostles \"left behind them Irish\r\nbooks, bells, and croziers, wherefrom one could understand they were\r\nIrishmen.\"\r\n\r\nBut St. Brendan, the voyager, is the most wonderful of the mariner\r\nmonks of Ireland. He accomplished apostolic work in both Wales and\r\nScotland, but his seafaring instincts urged him to make missionary\r\nvoyages to regions hitherto unknown. Some writers, not without\r\nreason, have actually maintained that he and his followers traveled\r\nas far as the American shore. Be this as it may, the tradition of the\r\ndiscoveries of this Irish monk kept in mind the possibly existing\r\nwestern land, and issued at last in the discovery of the great\r\ncontinent of America by Columbus.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBRIA: Turn now to Northumbria. Adamnan writes that St.\r\nColumcille's name was honored not only in Gaul, Spain, and Italy, but\r\nin Rome itself. England, however, owes to it a special veneration,\r\nbecause of the widespread apostolic work accomplished within her\r\nborders by Columcille's Irish disciples. The facts are as follows:\r\nNorthumbrian Christianity was well-nigh exterminated through the\r\nvictory of Penda the pagan over Edwin the Christian, A.D. 633. St.\r\nPaulinus, its local Roman apostle, was driven permanently from his\r\nnewly founded churches. Meanwhile Oswald and his brother Edwith\r\nsought refuge among the Irish monks of lona, and received baptism at\r\ntheir hands. Edwith died and Oswald became heir to the throne. A\r\nbattle was fought. The day before he met the pagan army, between the\r\nTyne and the Solway, Oswald beheld St. Columcille in vision saying to\r\nhim: \"Be strong and of good faith; I will be with thee.\" The result\r\nof this vision of the abbot of Iona was that a considerable part of\r\nEngland received the true faith. Oswald was victorious; he united the\r\nkingdoms of Deira and Bernicia, and became overlord of practically\r\nall England, with the exception of Kent. There was evangelization to\r\nbe done, and St. Oswald turned to Iona. In response to his appeal,\r\nthe Irish bishop, St. Aidan, was sent with several companions. They\r\nwere established on the island of Lindisfarne, in sight of the royal\r\nresidence at Bamborough. These monks labored in union with, and even\r\nseemed to exceed in zeal, the Roman missionaries in the south under\r\nSt. Augustine. However great the enthusiasm they had displayed for\r\nconversions in Iona, they displayed still greater on the desolate\r\nisle of Lindisfarne. In the first instance St. Aidan and his monks\r\nevangelized Northumbria. Want of facility in preaching in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon tongue was at first an obstacle, but it was speedily\r\novercome, for king Oswald himself, who knew both Gaelic and English,\r\ncame forward and acted as interpreter.\r\n\r\nWhen St. Aidan died in 651, Iona sent St. Finan, another Irish\r\nbishop, to succeed him. Finan spread the faith beyond the borders of\r\nNorthumbria and succeeded so well that he himself baptized Penda,\r\nking of the Mid-Angles, and Sigebert, king of the East Saxons. Diuma\r\nand Cellach, Irish monks, assisted by three Anglo-Saxon disciples of\r\nSt. Aidan, consolidated the mission to the Mercians.\r\n\r\nANGLIA: While Christianity was thus being restored in Northumbria,\r\nother Irish apostles were teaching it in East Anglia. St. Fursey,\r\naccompanied by his brother St. Foillan and St. Ultan and the priests\r\nGobham and Dicuil, landed in England in 633, and began to labor in\r\nthe eastern portions of Anglia. In his monastery at Burghcastle, in\r\nSuffolk, the convert king Sigebert made his monastic profession, and\r\nin the same house many heavenly visions were vouchsafed to its\r\nfounder.\r\n\r\nThe South Saxons had in Dicuil an apostle who founded the monastery\r\nof Bosham in Sussex, whence originated the episcopal see of\r\nChichester. Another Irish monk named Maeldubh settled among the West\r\nSaxons and became the founder of Malmesbury Abbey and the instructor\r\nof the well-known St. Aldhelm.\r\n\r\nThus did Irish monks contribute to the conversion of Great Britain\r\nand its many distant islands. They built up the faith by their holy\r\nlives, their preaching, and their enthusiasm, and wisely provided for\r\nits perpetuation by educating a native clergy and by the founding of\r\nmonastic institutions.\r\n\r\nThey were not yet satisfied, so they turned towards other lands to\r\nbring to other peoples the glad tidings of salvation.\r\n\r\nGAUL: In 590 St. Columbanus, a monk of Bangor in Ireland, accompanied\r\nby twelve brethren, arrived in France, having passed through Britain.\r\nAfter the example of St. Columcille in Caledonia, they traveled to\r\nthe court of Gontram, king of Burgundy, in order to secure his help\r\nand protection. During the course of the journey they preached to the\r\npeople, and all were impressed with their modesty, patience, and\r\ndevotion. At that epoch Gaul was sadly in need of such missionaries,\r\nfor, owing partly to the invasion of barbarians and partly to\r\nremissness on the part of the clergy, vice and impiety everywhere\r\nprevailed. Columbanus, because of his zeal, sanctity, and learning,\r\nwas well fitted for the task that lay before him. One of his early\r\nworks in Burgundy was the founding of the monastery of Luxeuil, which\r\nbecame the parent of many other monasteries founded either by himself\r\nor by his disciples. Many holy men came from Ireland to join the\r\ncommunity, and so numerous did the monks of Luxeuil become that\r\nseparate choirs were formed to keep up perpetual praise--the \"laus\r\nperennis\". But Columbanus did not remain at Luxeuil. In his strict\r\nuncompromising preaching he spared not even kings, and he preferred\r\nto leave his flourishing monastery rather than pass over in silence\r\nthe vices of the Merovingians. He escaped from the malice of\r\nBrunehaut, and, being banished from Burgundy, made his way to\r\nNeustria, and thence to Metz. Full of zeal, he resolved to preach the\r\nfaith to the pagans along the Rhine, and with this purpose set out\r\nwith a few of his followers. They proceeded as far as the Lake of\r\nZurich, and finally established themselves at Bregentz, on the Lake\r\nof Constance.\r\n\r\nBy this time his disciple St. Gall had learned the Alemannian\r\ndialect, which enabled him to push forward the work of\r\nevangelization. But Columbanus felt that he was called to labor in\r\nother lands while vigor remained to him, so, bidding his favorite\r\nfollower farewell, he crossed the Alps and arrived at Milan in\r\nnorthern Italy. King Agilulph and his queen, Theodelinda, gave the\r\nIrish abbot a reverent and kind welcome. His zeal was still unspent,\r\nand he worked much for the conversion of the Lombard Arians. Here he\r\nfounded, between Milan and Genoa, the monastery of Bobbio, which as a\r\ncentre of knowledge and piety was long the light of northern Italy.\r\nIn this monastery he died in the year 615, but not before the arrival\r\nof messengers from King Clothaire, inviting him to return to Luxeuil,\r\nas his enemies were now no more. But he could not go; all he asked\r\nwas protection for his dear monks at Luxeuil.\r\n\r\nIt has been said most truly that Ireland never sent a greater son to\r\ndo God's work in foreign lands than Columbanus. The fruit of his\r\nlabors remained; and for centuries after his death his influence was\r\nwidely felt throughout Europe, especially in France and Italy. His\r\nzeal for the interests of God was unbounded, and this was the secret\r\nof his immense power. Some of his writings have come down to us, and\r\ncomprise his Rule for Monks, his Penitential, sixteen short sermons,\r\nsix letters, and several poems, all in Latin. His letters are of much\r\nvalue as evidence of Ireland's ancient belief in papal supremacy.\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND: Gall, Columbanus's disciple, remained in Switzerland. In\r\na fertile valley, lying between two rivers and surrounded by hills,\r\nhe laid the beginnings of the great abbey which afterwards bore his\r\nname and became one of the most famous monasteries in Christendom.\r\nSt. Gall spent thirty years of his life in Helvetia, occupying\r\nhimself in teaching, preaching, and prayer. He succeeded where others\r\nhad failed, and that which was denied to Columbanus was reserved for\r\nGall, his disciple, and the latter is entitled the Apostle of\r\nAlemannia.\r\n\r\nOther districts had their Irish missionaries and apostles. Not far\r\nfrom St. Gall, at Seckingen, near Basle, St. Fridolin was a pioneer\r\nin the work of evangelization.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the seventh century St. Kilian, an Irishman,\r\nwith his companions, Totnan and Colman, arrived in Franconia. He was\r\nmartyred in Würtzburg, where he is honored as patron and apostle.\r\n\r\nSigisbert, another Irish follower of St. Columbanus, spread the faith\r\namong the half-pagan people of eastern Helvetia, and founded the\r\nmonastery of Dissentis in Rhaetia.\r\n\r\nSt. Ursanne, a little town on the boundaries of Switzerland, took its\r\norigin from another disciple of St. Columbanus.\r\n\r\nOTHER APOSTLES AND FOUNDERS: Desire for solitary life drew St. Fiacre\r\nto a hermitage near Meaux, where he transformed wooded glades into\r\ngardens to provide vegetables for poor people. This charity has\r\nearned for Fiacre the title of patron saint of gardeners.\r\n\r\nSt. Fursey, the illustrious apostle of East Anglia, crossed over to\r\nFrance, where he travelled and preached continuously. He built a\r\nmonastery at Lagny-sur-Marne, and was about to return to East Anglia\r\nwhen he died at Mézerolles, near Doullens. St. Gobham followed his\r\nmaster's example, and like him evangelized and founded monasteries.\r\nSt. Etto (Zé) acted in like manner. St. Foillan and St. Ultan,\r\nbrothers of St. Fursey, became apostles in southern Brabant.\r\n\r\nThe monastery of Honau, on an island near Strasburg, and that of\r\nAltomünster, in Bavaria, owe their foundation to the Irish monks\r\nTuban and Alto, respectively.\r\n\r\nNot far from Luxeuil was the Abbey of Lure, another great Irish\r\nfoundation, due to Deicolus (Desle, Dichuill), a brother of St. Gall\r\nand a disciple of St. Columbanus. So important was this house\r\nconsidered in later times that its abbot was numbered among the\r\nprinces of the Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nRouen, in Normandy, felt the influence of the Irish monks through the\r\ninstrumentality of St. Ouen; and the monasteries of Jouarre, Rebais,\r\nJumièges, Leuconaus, and St. Vandrille were due at least indirectly\r\nto Columbanus or his disciples.\r\n\r\nTurning to Belgium, it is recorded that St. Romold preached the faith\r\nin Mechlin, and St. Livinus in Ghent. Both came from Ireland.\r\n\r\nSt. Virgilius, a voluntary exile from Erin, \"for the love of Christ\",\r\nestablished his monastery at Salzburg, in Austria. He became bishop\r\nthere, and died in 781.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Celtic Rule of Columbanus was carried into Picardy by\r\nSt. Valery, St. Omer, St. Bertin, St. Mummolin, and St. Valdelenus;\r\nbut the Irish Caidoc and Fricor had already preceded them, their work\r\nresulting in the foundation of the Abbey of St. Riquier.\r\n\r\nITALY: Something yet remains to be said of the monks of Ireland in\r\nItaly. Anterior to St. Columbanus's migration, his fellow countryman,\r\nSt. Frigidian (or Fridian), had taken up his abode in Italy at Monte\r\nPisana, not far from the city of Lucca, where he became famed for\r\nsanctity and wisdom. On the death of the bishop of Lucca, Frigidian\r\nwas compelled to occupy the vacant see. St. Gregory the Great wrote\r\nof him that \"he was a man of rare virtue\". His teachings and holy\r\nlife not only influenced the lives of his own flock, but brought to\r\nthe faith many heretics and pagans. In Lucca this Celtic apostle is\r\nstill honored under the name of St. Frediano.\r\n\r\nSt. Pellegrinus is another Irish saint who sought solitude at\r\nGarfanana in the Apennines; and Cathaldus, a Waterford saint, in 680,\r\nbecame Bishop of Taranto, which he governed for many years with zeal\r\nand great wisdom. His co-worker was Donatus, his brother, who founded\r\nthe church at Lecce in the Kingdom of Naples.\r\n\r\nOf the two learned Irishmen, Clemens and Albinus, who resided in\r\nFrance in the eighth century, Albinus was sent into Italy, where at\r\nPavia he was placed at the head of the school attached to St.\r\nAugustine's monastery. Dungal, his compatriot, was a famous teacher\r\nin the same city. Lothair thus ordained concerning him: \"We desire\r\nthat at Pavia, and under the superintendence of Dungal, all students\r\nshould assemble from Milan, Brescia, Lodi, Bergamo, Novara, Vercelli,\r\nTortona, Acqui, Genoa, Asti, Como.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this same Dungal who presented the Bangor psalter to Bobbio;\r\ntherefore it may be reasonably conjectured that he came from the very\r\nmonastery that produced Columbanus, Gall, and Comgall.\r\n\r\nFiesole, in Tuscany, venerates two Irish eighth-century saints,\r\nDonatus and Andrew. The former was educated at Iniscaltra, and Andrew\r\nwas his friend and disciple. After visiting Rome, they lingered at\r\nFiesole. Donatus was received with great honor by clergy and people\r\nand was requested to fill their vacant bishopric. With much\r\nhesitation he took upon himself ihe burden, which he bore for many\r\nyears. His biographer says of him that \"he was liberal in almsgiving,\r\nsedulous in watching, devout in prayer, excellent in doctrine, ready\r\nin speech, holy in life.\" Andrew, who was his deacon, founded the\r\nchurch and monastery of St. Martin in Mensola, and is known in\r\nFiesole as St. Andrew of Ireland, or St. Andrew the Scot, that is,\r\nthe Irishman.\r\n\r\nHOSPITALIA: Thus Irish monks were to be found in France, Belgium,\r\nSwitzerland, Germany, and Italy, and even in Bulgaria. So numerous\r\nwere they and so frequent their travels through the different\r\ncountries of Europe that hospices were founded to befriend them.\r\nThese institutions were known as \"Hospitalia Scottorum\" (\"Hospices\r\nfor the Irish\"), and their benefactors were not only pious laymen but\r\nthe highest ecclesiastical authorities. Sometimes the hospices were\r\ndiverted to purposes other than those originally intended, and then\r\nChurch Councils would intervene in favor of the lawful inheritors.\r\nThus in 845 we read that the Council of Meaux ordered the hospices in\r\nFrance to be restored to the dispossessed Irishmen. In the twelfth\r\ncentury Ireland still continued to send forth a constant succession\r\nof monk-pilgrims, renowned for faith, austerity, and piety.\r\n\r\nRATISBON: Special monasteries were erected to be peopled by the\r\nIrish. The most renowned of these dates from 1067, when Marianus\r\nScotus (\"Marianus the Irishman\"), with his companions, John and\r\nCandidus, left his native land and arrived in Bavaria. These holy men\r\nwere welcomed at Ratisbon by the Bishop Otto; and on the advice of\r\nMurcherat, an Irish recluse, took up their residence near St. Peter's\r\nchurch at the outskirts of the city. Novices flocked from Ireland to\r\njoin them and a monastery was erected to receive the community. In a\r\nshort time this had to be replaced by a still larger one, which was\r\nknown to future ages as the Abbey of St. James's of the Scots (that\r\nis, Irish) at Ratisbon. How prolific was this parent foundation is\r\nevidenced from its many offshoots, the only surviving monasteries on\r\nthe continent for many centuries intended for Irish brethren. These,\r\nbesides St. James's at Erfurt and St. Peter's at Ratisbon, comprised\r\nSt. James's at Würtzburg, St. Giles's at Nuremberg, St. Mary's at\r\nVienna, St. James's at Constance, St. Nicholas's at Memmingen, Holy\r\nCross at Eichstatt, a Priory at Kelheim and another at Oels in\r\nSilesia, all of which were founded during the twelfth or thirteenth\r\ncentury, and formed a Benedictine congregation approved of by Pope\r\nInnocent III., and presided over by the Abbot of Ratisbon. These\r\nIrish houses, with their long lines of Celtic abbots, in the days of\r\ntheir prosperity did much work that was excellent and civilizing, and\r\nrightly deserve a remembrance in the achievements of Ireland's\r\nancient missionaries.\r\n\r\nRatisbon and its dependent abbeys, as is set forth in the papal\r\nbriefs of 1218, possessed priories in Ireland, and, from these,\r\nnovices were usually obtained.\r\n\r\nBut evil days came for the Congregation of St. James, and now it is\r\nextinct. The subjugation of Ireland to England, says Wattenbach,\r\ncontributed no doubt to the rapid decline of the Scotic (that is,\r\nIrish) monasteries. For from Ireland they had up till then been\r\ncontinually receiving fresh supplies of strength. In this their\r\nfatherland the root of their vitality was to be found. Loss of\r\nindependence involved loss of enterprise.\r\n\r\nSCHOLARSHIP AND INFLUENCE: Irish monks were not only apostles of\r\nsouls, but also masters of intellectual life. Thus in the seventh\r\ncentury the Celtic monastery of Luxeuil became the most celebrated\r\nschool in Christendom. Monks from other houses and sons of the\r\nnobility crowded to it. The latter were clearly not intended for the\r\ncloister, but destined for callings in the world.\r\n\r\nThere were outstanding men among these missionaries from Ireland. St.\r\nVirgilius of Salzburg in the eighth century taught the sphericity of\r\nthe earth and the existence of the Antipodes. It was this same\r\nteaching that Copernicus and later astronomers formulated into the\r\nsystem now in vogue.\r\n\r\nSt. Columcille himself was a composer of Latin hymns and a penman of\r\nno mean order, as the Book of Kells, if written by him, sufficiently\r\nproves. In all the monasteries which he founded, provision was made\r\nfor the pursuit of sacred learning and the multiplication of books by\r\ntranscription. The students of his schools were taught classics,\r\nmechanical arts, law, history, and physics. They improved the methods\r\nof husbandry and gardening; supplied the people, whom they helped to\r\ncivilize, with implements of labor; and taught them the use of the\r\nforge, an accomplishment belonging to almost every Irish monk.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Adamnan, who spent most of his life outside his\r\nnative land, show that he was familiar with the best Latin authors,\r\nand had a knowledge of Greek as well. His \"Vita S. Columbae\" (\"Life\r\nof St. Columcille\") has made his name immortal as a Latin writer. His\r\nbook \"De Locis Sanctis\" (\"On the Holy Places\") contains information\r\nhe received from the pilgrim bishop Arculfus, who had been driven by\r\na tempest to take refuge with the monks of Iona. On account of the\r\nimportance of the writings of Adamnan and because of his influence in\r\nsecular and ecclesiastical affairs of importance, few will question\r\nhis right to a distinguished place among the saintly scholars of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nIrish monks, abroad as well as at home, were pre-eminently students\r\nand exponents of Holy Scripture. Sedulius wrote a commentary on the\r\nEpistles of St. Paul; John Scotus Erigena composed a work, \"De\r\nPraedestinatione\" (\"Concerning Predestination\"); Dungal was not only\r\nan astronomer, but also an excellent theologian, as is clear from his\r\ndefence of Catholic teaching on the invocation of saints and the\r\nveneration of their relics. His knowledge of Sacred Scripture and of\r\nthe Fathers is exceedingly remarkable.\r\n\r\nSt. Columbanus, besides other works, is said to have composed an\r\nexposition of the Psalms, which is mentioned in the catalogue of St.\r\nGall's library, but which cannot now be identified with certainty.\r\nThe writings of this abbot are said to have brought about a more\r\nfrequent use of confession both in the world and in monasteries; and\r\nhis legislation regarding the Blessed Sacrament fostered eucharistic\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\nMarianus Scotus is the author of a commentary on the Psalms, so\r\nprecious that rarely was it allowed to pass beyond the walls of the\r\nmonastic library. His commentary on St. Paul's Epistles is regarded\r\nas his most famous production. Herein he shows acquaintance with\r\nSaints Jerome, Augustine, Gregory, and Leo, with Cassiodorus, Origen,\r\nAlcuin, Cassian, and Peter the Deacon. He completed the work on the\r\n17th May, 1079, and ends the volume by asking the reader to pray for\r\nthe salvation of his soul.\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIPTION: In all the monasteries a vast number of scribes were\r\ncontinually employed in multiplying copies of the Sacred Scriptures.\r\nThese masterpieces of calligraphy, written by Irish hands, have been\r\nscattered throughout the libraries of Europe, and many fragments\r\nremain to the present day. The beauty of these manuscripts is praised\r\nby all, and the names of the best transcribers often find mention in\r\nmonastic annals. The work was irksome, but it was looked upon as a\r\nprivilege and meritorious.\r\n\r\nIt remains to speak of that glorious monument of the Irish monks, the\r\nabbey of St. Gall, in Switzerland. It was here that Celtic influence\r\nwas most felt and endured the longest. Within its walls for centuries\r\nthe sacred sciences were taught and classic authors studied. Many of\r\nits monks excelled as musicians and poets, while others were noted\r\nfor their skill in calligraphy and the fine arts. The library was\r\nonly in its infancy in the eighth century, but gradually it grew, and\r\neventually became one of the largest and richest in the world. The\r\nbrethren were in correspondence with all the learned houses of France\r\nand Italy, and there was constant mutual interchange of books, sacred\r\nand scientific, between them.\r\n\r\nThey manufactured their own parchment from the hides of the wild\r\nbeasts that roamed in the forests around them, and bound their books\r\nin boards of wood clamped with iron or ivory.\r\n\r\nSuch was the monastery of St. Gall, which owes its inception to the\r\njourney through Europe of the great Columbanus and his\r\nmonk-companions--men whose lives, according to Bede, procured for the\r\nreligious habit great veneration, so that wherever they appeared they\r\nwere received with joy, as God's own servants. \"And what will be the\r\nreward,\" asks the biographer of Marianus Scotus, \"of these\r\npilgrim-monks who left the sweet soil of their native land, its\r\nmountains and hills, its valleys and its groves, its rivers and pure\r\nfountains, and went like the children of Abraham without hesitation\r\ninto the land which God had pointed out to them?\" He answers thus:\r\n\"They will dwell in the house of the Lord with the angels and\r\narchangels of God forever; they will behold the God of gods in Sion,\r\nto whom be honor and glory for ever and ever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nLanigan: Ecclesiastical History of Ireland (Dublin, 1829);\r\nMontalembert: Monks of the West (Edinburgh, 1861); Moran: Irish\r\nSaints in Great Britain (Dublin, 1903); Dalgairns: Apostles of Europe\r\n(London, 1876); Healy: Ireland's Ancient Schools and Scholars\r\n(Dublin, 1890); Barrett: A Calendar of Scottish Saints (Fort\r\nAugustus, 1904); Stokes: Six Months in the Apennines (London, 1892),\r\nThree Months in the Forests of France (London, 1895); Fowler: Vita S.\r\nColumbae (Oxford, 1894); Wattenbach: Articles in Ulster Journal of\r\nArchaeology, vol. 7 (Belfast, 1859); Gougaud: Les Chrétientés\r\nceltiques (Paris, 1911); Hogan: Articles in Irish Ecclesiastical\r\nRecord, 1894, 1895; Drane: Christian Schools and Scholars (London,\r\n1881).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH AND THE SEA\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM H. BABCOCK, LL.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of Irish navigation, like the beginning of everything\r\nelse, is hidden in the mist of antiquity. Vessels of some kind\r\nobviously must have borne the successive waves of immigrants or\r\ninvaders to the island. Naturally they would remain in use afterwards\r\nfor trade, travel, exploration, and war. Irish ships may have been\r\namong those of the Breton fleet that Cæsar dispersed at Vannes after\r\nan obstinate struggle. Two or three centuries later we find Niall of\r\nthe Nine Hostages making nautical descents on the neighboring shores,\r\nespecially Britain: and there is every probability that ships of the\r\nisland conveyed some at least of the \"Scots\" (Irish) whom Gildas in\r\nthe sixth century describes as joining the Picts in furiously\r\nstorming the Roman wall.\r\n\r\nThe equally adventurous but more pacific work of exploration went on\r\nalso, if we may judge by that extraordinary series of Irish\r\nsea-sagas, the _Imrama_, comprising the Voyages of Bran, Maelduin,\r\nthe Hui Corra, and St. Brendan--the last-mentioned deservedly the\r\nmost famous. These vary in their literary merits and in the merits of\r\ntheir several parts, for they have been successively rewritten at\r\ndifferent periods, receiving always something of the color, belief,\r\nand adornment which belonged to the writer's time; but under all may\r\nbe dimly traced, as in a palimpsest, the remote pagan original. At\r\ntheir best they embody a lofty and touching poetry very subtle and\r\nsignificant, as when we read of Bran's summoning by a visitant of\r\nsupernatural beauty to the isles of undying delight, where a thousand\r\nyears are but as a day; his return with a companion who had been\r\novercome by longing for Ireland and home; the man's falling to ashes\r\nat the first touch of the native soil, as though he had been long\r\ndead; and the flight of Bran and his crew from the real living world\r\nto the islands of the blessed. At least equally fine and stirring is\r\nSt. Brendan's interview with the exiled spirit of Heaven, whose \"sin\r\nwas but little\", so that he and his fellows were given only the\r\npleasing penance of singing delightfully, in the guise of beautiful\r\nbirds, the praises of the God who showed them mercy and grace, amid\r\nthe charms of an earthly paradise. \"Then all the birds sang evensong,\r\nso that it was an heavenly noise to hear.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not very surprising that St. Brendan's legend, with such\r\nqualities in prose and verse, made itself at home in many lands and\r\nlanguages, and became for centuries a widespread popular favorite and\r\nmatter of general belief, also influencing the most permanent\r\nliterature of a high contemplative cast, which we might suppose to be\r\nout of touch with it altogether. Certain of its more unusual\r\nincidents are found even in Arab writings of romance founded on fact,\r\nas in Edrisi's narrative of the Magrurin explorers of Lisbon and the\r\nadventures of Sinbad related in the Arabian Nights; but perhaps here\r\nwe have a case of reciprocal borrowing such as may well occur when\r\nships' companies of different nations meet.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous, insistent, and repeated feature of all these\r\n_Imrama_ is a belief in Atlantic islands fair enough or wonderful\r\nenough to tempt the shore dwellers of Ireland far away and hold them\r\nspell-bound for years. It is easy to ascribe these pictures to sunset\r\non the ocean, or the wonders of mirage; but all the time, within long\r\nsailing distance, there actually were islands of delightful climate\r\nand exceeding beauty. These had been occasionally reached from the\r\nMediterranean ever since early Carthaginian times, as classical\r\nauthors seem to tell us; why not also from Ireland, perhaps not quite\r\nso distant? It is undoubted that the Canary Islands were never really\r\naltogether forgotten, and the same is probably true of the Madeiras\r\nand all three groups of Azores, though the knowledge that lingered in\r\nIreland was a distorted glimmering tradition of old voyages,\r\noccasionally inciting to new ventures in the same field.\r\n\r\nSome have supposed, though without sufficient evidence, that Saint\r\nBrendan even made his way to America, and parts of that shore line in\r\nseveral different latitudes have been selected as the scene of the\r\nexploit. His first entry into serious geography is in the fine maps\r\nof Dulcert, 1339, and the Pizigani, 1367, both of which plainly label\r\nMadeira, Porto Santo, and Las Desertas--\"The Fortunate Islands of St.\r\nBrandan.\" That there may be no possibility of misunderstanding, the\r\nPizigani brothers present a full-length portrait of the holy\r\nnavigator himself bending over these islands with hands of\r\nbenediction. The inscription, though not the picture, was common,\r\nthus applied, on the maps of the next century or two, and no other\r\ninterpretation of his voyage found any place until a later time.\r\n\r\nOf course the fourteenth century was a long way from the sixth, when\r\nthe voyage was supposed to have been made, and we cannot take so late\r\na verdict as convincing proof of any fact. But it at least exhibits\r\nthe current interpretation of the written narrative among geographers\r\nand mariners, the people best able to judge; and here the interval\r\nwas much less. The story itself seems to corroborate them in a\r\ngeneral way, if read naturally. One would say that it tells of a\r\nvoyage to the Canaries, of which one is unmistakably \"the island\r\nunder Mount Atlas\", and that this was undertaken by way of the Azores\r\nand Madeira, with inevitable experience of great beauty in some\r\nislands and volcanic terrors in others. Madeira may well have been\r\npitched upon by the interpreters as the suitable scene of a\r\nparticularly long tarrying by the way. Of course magic filled out all\r\ngaps of real knowledge, and wonders grew with each new rewriting.\r\n\r\nWhatever Brendan did, there is no doubt that Irish mariner-monks,\r\nincited by the great awakening which followed St. Patrick's mission,\r\ncovered many seas in their frail vessels during the next three or\r\nfour centuries. They set up a flourishing religious establishment in\r\nOrkney, made stepping stones of the intervening islands, and reached\r\nIceland some time in the eighth century, if not earlier. The\r\nNorsemen, following in their tracks as always, found them there, and\r\nthe earliest Icelandic writings record their departure, leaving\r\nbehind them books, bells, and other souvenirs on an islet off shore\r\nwhich still bears their name.\r\n\r\nDid they keep before the Norsemen to America too? At least the\r\nNorsemen thought so. For centuries the name Great Ireland or\r\nWhitemen's Land was accepted in Norse geography as meaning a region\r\nfar west of Ireland, a parallel to Great Sweden (Russia), which lay\r\nfar east of Sweden. The saga of Thorfinn Karlsefni, first to attempt\r\ncolonizing America, makes it plain that his followers believed Great\r\nIreland to be somewhere in that region, and it is explicitly located\r\nnear Wineland by the twelfth century Landnamabok. Also there were\r\nspecific tales afloat of a distinguished Icelander lost at sea, who\r\nwas afterward found in a western region by an Irish vessel long\r\ndriven before the storm. The version most relied on came through one\r\nRafn, who had dwelt in Limerick; also through Thorfinn, earl of the\r\nOrkneys.\r\n\r\nBrazil, the old Irish _Breasail_, was another name for land west of\r\nIreland--where there is none short of America--on very many medieval\r\nmaps, of which perhaps a dozen are older than the year 1400, the\r\nearliest yet found being that of Dalorto, 1325. Usually it appears as\r\na nearly circular disc of land opposite Munster, at first altogether\r\ntoo near the Irish coast, as indeed the perfectly well-known Corvo\r\nwas drawn much too near the coast of Spain, or as even in the\r\nsixteenth century, when Newfoundland had been repeatedly visited,\r\nthat island was shifted by divers mapmakers eastward towards Ireland,\r\nalmost to the conventional station of Brazil. Also, not long\r\nafterwards, the maps of Nicolay and Zaltieri adopted the reverse\r\ntreatment of transferring Brazil to Newfoundland waters, as if\r\nrecognizing past error and restoring its proper place.\r\n\r\nThe name Brazil appears not to have been adopted by the Norsemen, but\r\nthere is one fifteenth century map, perhaps of 1480, preserved in\r\nMilan, which shows this large disc-form \"Brazil\" just below Greenland\r\n(\"Illa Verde\"), in such relation that the mapmaker really must have\r\nknown of Labrador under the former name and believed that it could be\r\nreadily reached from that Norse colony.\r\n\r\nIt seems altogether likely that \"Brazil\" was applied to the entire\r\noutjutting region of America surrounding the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence--that part of this continent which is by far the nearest\r\nIreland. Besides the facts above stated, certain coincidences of real\r\ngeography and of these old maps favor that belief, and they are quite\r\nunlikely to have been guessed or invented. Thus certain maps,\r\nbeginning with 1375, while keeping the circular external outline of\r\nIreland, reduce the land area to a mere ring, enclosing an expanse of\r\nwater dotted with islands; and certain other maps show it still\r\nnearly circular externally, and solid, but divided into two parts by\r\na curved channel nearly from north to south. The former exposition is\r\npossible enough to one more concerned with the nearly enclosed Gulf\r\nof St. Lawrence and its islands than with its two comparatively\r\nnarrow outlets; the second was afterward repeated approximately by\r\nGastoldi's map illustrating Ramusio when he was somehow moved to\r\nminimize the width of the Gulf, though well remembering the straits\r\nof Belle Isle and Cabot. There are some other coincidences, but it is\r\nunnecessary to dwell on them. Land west of Ireland must be either\r\npure fancy or the very region in question, and it is hardly\r\nbelievable that fancy could guess so accurately as to two different\r\ninterpretations of real though unusual geography and give them right\r\nlatitude, with such an old Irish name (Brazil) as might naturally\r\nhave been conferred in the early voyaging times. That an extensive\r\nregion, chiefly mainland, should be represented as an island is no\r\nobjection, as anyone will see by examining the maps which break up\r\neverything north of South America in the years next following the\r\nachievements of Columbus and Cabot. There was a natural tendency to\r\nexpect nothing but islands short of Asia.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely, therefore, that America was actually reached by the\r\nIrish even before the Norsemen and certainly long before all other\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nBabcock: Early Norse Visits to North America, Smithsonian Publication\r\n2138 (1913); Baring-Gould: Curious Myths of the Middle Ages;\r\nBeauvois: The Discovery of the New World by the Irish; Cantwell:\r\nPre-Columbian Discoveries of America; Daly: The Legend of St.\r\nBrandan, Celtic Review, vol.

P.S. DINNEEN, M.A., R.U.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The distinguishing property of man,\" says Cicero, \"is to search for\r\nand follow after truth. Therefore, when disengaged from our necessary\r\ncares and concerns, we desire to see, to hear, and to learn, and we\r\nesteem knowledge of things obscure or wonderful as indispensable to\r\nour happiness.\" (_De Officiis_ I., 4).\r\n\r\nI claim for the Irish race that throughout their history they have\r\ncut down their bodily necessities to the quick, in order to devote\r\ntime and energy to the pursuit of knowledge; that they have engaged\r\nin intellectual pursuits, not infrequently of a high order, on a low\r\nbasis of material comfort; that they have persevered in the quest of\r\nlearning under unparalleled hardships and difficulties, even in the\r\ndark night of \"a nation's eclipse\", when a school was an unlawful\r\nassembly and school-teaching a crime. I claim, moreover, that, when\r\ncircumstances were favorable, no people have shown a more adventurous\r\nspirit or a more chivalrous devotion in the advancement and spread of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nLove of learning implies more than a natural aptitude for acquiring\r\ninformation. It connotes a zest for knowledge that is recondite and\r\nattainable only at the expense of ease, of leisure, of the comforts\r\nand luxuries of life, and a zeal for the cultivation of the mental\r\nfaculties. It is of the soul and not of the body; it refines,\r\nelevates, adorns. It is allied to sensibility, to keenness of vision,\r\nto the close observation of mental phenomena. Its possessor becomes a\r\ncitizen of the known world. His mind broadens; he compares,\r\ncontrasts, conciliates; he brings together the new and the old, the\r\nnear and the distant, the permanent and the transitory, and weaves\r\nfrom them all the web of systematized human thought.\r\n\r\nI am not here concerned with the extent of Ireland's contribution to\r\nthe sum of human learning, nor with the career of her greatest\r\nscholars; I am merely describing the love of learning which is\r\ncharacteristic of the race, and which it seems best to present in a\r\nbrief study of distinct types drawn from various periods of Irish\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn the pre-Christian period the Druid was the chief representative of\r\nthe learning of the race. He was the adviser of kings and princes,\r\nand the instructor of their children. His knowledge was of the\r\nrecondite order and beyond the reach of ordinary persons. The esteem\r\nin which he was held by all classes of the people proves their love\r\nfor the learning for which he stood.\r\n\r\nPatrick came: and with him came a wider horizon of learning and\r\ngreater facilities for the acquisition and diffusion of knowledge.\r\nMonastic schools sprang up in all directions--at Clonard, Armagh,\r\nClonmacnois, Bangor, Lismore, Kildare, Innisfallen. These schools\r\nwere celebrated throughout Europe in the earlier middle ages, and\r\nfrom the fifth to the ninth century Ireland led the nations of Europe\r\nin learning and deserved the title of the \"Island of Saints and\r\nScholars.\" Our type is the student in one of these monastic schools.\r\nHe goes out from his parents and settles down to study in the\r\nenvirons of the monastery. He is not rich; he resides in a hut; his\r\ntime is divided between study, prayer, and manual labor. He becomes a\r\nmonk, only to increase in devotion to learning and to accentuate his\r\nprivations. He copies and illuminates manuscripts. He memorizes the\r\nPsalms. He glosses the Vulgate Scriptures with vernacular notes. He\r\nreceives ordination, and, realizing that there are benighted\r\ncountries ten times as large as his native land beyond the seas, and,\r\nburning with zeal for the spread of the Gospel and the advancement of\r\nlearning, sails for Britain, or passes into Gaul, or reaches the\r\nslopes of the Apennines, or the outskirts of the Black Forest. The\r\nrest of his life is devoted to the foundation of monasteries to which\r\nschools are attached, to the building of churches, and to the\r\ndiffusion around him of every known branch of knowledge. He may have\r\ntaken books from Ireland over seas, and, of these, relics are now to\r\nbe found among the treasures of the ancient libraries of Europe.\r\nColumcille, Columbanus, Adamnan, Gall, Virgilius occur to the mind in\r\ndwelling on this type.\r\n\r\nThe hereditary _seanchaidhe_, who treasured up the traditional lore\r\nof the clan and its chief, was held in high honor and enjoyed\r\nextraordinary privileges. He held a freehold. He was high in the\r\ngraces of the chief, and officiated at his inauguration.\r\n\r\nAn important type is the Irish ecclesiastical student abroad in the\r\npenal days. School teaching, unless at the sacrifice of Faith, was a\r\ncrime in Ireland, and the training required for the priesthood had to\r\nbe obtained on the continent. The Irish out of their poverty\r\nestablished colleges in Rome (1628), Salamanca (1593), Seville\r\n(1612), Alcala (1590), Lisbon (1593), Louvain (1634), Antwerp (1629),\r\nDouai (1577), Lille (1610), Bordeaux (1603), Toulouse (1659), Paris\r\n(1605), and elsewhere. As late as 1795 these colleges contained 478\r\nstudents, and some of them are still in existence. The young student\r\nin going abroad risked everything. He often returned watched by\r\nspies, with his life in danger. Yet the supply never failed; the\r\ncolleges flourished; and those who returned diffused around them not\r\nonly learning but the urbanity and refinement which were a striking\r\nfruit and mark of their studies abroad.\r\n\r\nAnother type is the Irish scribe. In the days of Ireland's fame and\r\nprosperity and of the flood-tide of her native language, he was a\r\nskilled craftsman, and the extant specimens of his work are\r\nunsurpassed of their kind. But I prefer to look at him at a later\r\nperiod, when he became our sole substitute for the printer and when\r\nhis diligence preserved for us all that remains of a fading\r\nliterature. He was miserably poor. He toiled through the day at the\r\nspade or the plough, or guided the shuttle through the loom. At\r\nnight, by the flare of the turf-fire or the fitful light of a\r\nsplinter of bogwood, he made his copy of poem or tract or tale, which\r\nbut for him would have perished. The copies are often ill-spelt and\r\nill-written, but with all their faults they are as noble a monument\r\nto national love of learning as any nation can boast of.\r\n\r\nIn our gallery of types we must not forget the character whom English\r\nwriters contemptuously called the \"hedge-schoolmaster.\" The\r\nhedge-school in its most elemental state was an open-air daily\r\nassemblage of youths in pursuit of knowledge. Inasmuch as the law had\r\nrefused learning a fitting temple in which to abide and be honored,\r\nshe was led by her votaries into the open, and there, beside the\r\nfragrant hedge, if you will, with the green sward for benches, and\r\nthe canopy of heaven for dome, she was honored in Ireland, even as\r\nshe had been honored ages before in Greece, in Palestine, and by our\r\nprimordial Celtic ancestors themselves. The hedge-schoolmaster\r\nconducted the rites, and the air resounded with the sonorous\r\nhexameters of Virgil and the musical odes of Horace.\r\n\r\nIn the Irish-speaking portions of the country the hedge-schoolmaster\r\nwas often also a poet who wrote mellifluous songs in Irish, which\r\nwere sung throughout the entire district and sometimes earned him\r\nenduring fame. Eoghan Ruadh O'Sullivan and Andrew MacGrath, called\r\n_An Mangaire Sugach_ or \"the Jolly Pedlar,\" are well-known instances\r\nof this type.\r\n\r\nThe poor scholar is another type that under varying forms and under\r\nvarious circumstances has ever trod the stage of Irish history. From\r\nan ancient Irish manuscript (See O'Curry, _Manners and Customs_, II,\r\n79, 80) we learn that Adamnan, the biographer of St. Columcille, and\r\nsome other youths studied at Clonard and were supported by the\r\nneighborhood. The poor scholar more than any other type embodies the\r\nlove of learning of the Irish race. In the schools which preceded the\r\nNational, he appeared in a most interesting stage of development. He\r\ncame from a distance, attracted by the reputation of a good teacher\r\nand the regularity of a well-conducted school. He came, avowedly\r\npoor. His only claim on the generosity of his teacher and of the\r\npublic was a marked aptitude for learning and an ardent desire for\r\nstudy and cultivation of mind. He did not look for luxuries. He was\r\nsatisfied, if his bodily wants were reasonably supplied, even with\r\nthe inconveniences of frequent change of abode. A welcome was\r\nextended to him on all sides. His hosts and patrons honored his\r\nthirst for knowledge and tenacity of purpose. He was expected to help\r\nthe students in the house where he found entertainment, and it may\r\nnot have been unpleasing to him on occasion to display his talents\r\nbefore his host. When school was over, it was not unusual to find him\r\nsurrounded by a group of school-companions, each pressing his claim\r\nto entertain him for the night.\r\n\r\nDespite the hospitality of his patrons, the poor scholar often felt\r\nthe bitterness of his dependent state, but he bore it with\r\nequanimity, his hand ever eagerly stretched out for the prize of\r\nlearning. What did learning bring him? Why was he so eager to bear\r\nfor its sake\r\n\r\n                         \"all the thousand aches\r\n      That patient merit of the unworthy takes\"?\r\n\r\nSometimes he became a priest; sometimes his life was purposeless and\r\nvoid. But he was ever urged onward by the fascination of learning and\r\nof the cultivation of the nobler part of his nature.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, the Irish who have emigrated to the\r\nAmerican and Australian continents have given touching proof of their\r\ndevotion to the cause of learning. I have space only for a few\r\npathetic examples.\r\n\r\nAn Irish workman in the United States, seeing my name in connection\r\nwith an Irish Dictionary, wrote to me a few years ago to ask how he\r\nmight procure one, as, he said, an Italian in the works had asked him\r\nthe meaning of _Erin go bragh_, and he felt ashamed to be unable to\r\nexplain it.\r\n\r\nA man who, at the age of three, had emigrated from Clare in the\r\nfamine time, wrote to me recently from Australia in the Irish\r\nlanguage and character.\r\n\r\nAn old man named John O'Regan of New Zealand, who had been twelve\r\nyears in exile in the United States and forty-eight on the Australian\r\ncontinent, with failing eyesight, in a letter that took him from\r\nJanuary to June of the year 1906 to write, endeavored to set down\r\nscraps of Irish lore which he had carried with him from the old\r\ncountry and which had clung to his memory to the last.\r\n\r\n\"In my digging life in the quarries,\" he says, \"books were not a part\r\nof our swag (prayerbook excepted). In 1871, when I had a long seat of\r\nwork before me, I sent for McCurtin's Dictionary to Melbourne. It is\r\nold and wanting in the introductory part, but for all was splendid\r\nand I loved it as my life.\" (See _Gaelic Journal_, Dec., 1906.)\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nJoyce: A Social History of Ancient Ireland (2 vols., 2d ed., Dublin,\r\n1913); Healy: Ireland's Ancient Schools and Scholars (Dublin, 1890),\r\nMaynooth College Centenary History (Dublin, 1895); O'Curry: Manners\r\nand Customs of the Ancient Irish, (3 vols., Dublin and London, 1873),\r\nManuscript Materials of Irish History, reissue (Dublin, 1873);\r\nCarleton: Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry, especially vol.\r\n3, The Poor Scholar; Montalembert: The Monks of the West, authorized\r\ntranslation, (7 vols., London, 1861); Meyer: Learning in Ireland in\r\nthe Fifth Century (Dublin, 1913); Dinneen: Poems of Eoghan Ruadh\r\nO'Sullivan, Introduction (Dublin, 1902), The Maigue Poets,\r\nIntroduction (Dublin, 1906); Boyle: The Irish College in Paris\r\n1578-1901, with a brief sketch of the other Irish Colleges in France\r\n(Dublin, 1901); Irish Ecclesiastical Record, new series, vol.

WINDLE, Sc.D., M.D.,\r\n\r\n_President, University College, Cork_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may divide our survey of the debt owed to Ireland by science into\r\nthree periods: the earliest, the intermediate, and the latest.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest period the names which come before us are chiefly\r\nthose of compilers such as Augustin, a monk and an Irishman who wrote\r\nat Carthage, in Africa, in the seventh century, a Latin treatise on\r\n_The Wonderful Things of the Sacred Scripture_, still extant, in\r\nwhich, in connection with Joshua's miracle, a very full account of\r\nthe astronomical knowledge of the period, Ptolemaic, but in many ways\r\nremarkably accurate, is given. There are, however, three\r\ndistinguished names. Virgil the Geometer, _i.e._, Fergil (O'Farrell),\r\nwas Abbot of Aghaboe, went to the continent in 741, and was\r\nafterwards Bishop of Salzburg. He died in 785. He is remembered by\r\nhis controversies with St. Boniface, one of which is concerned with\r\nthe question of the Antipodes. Virgil is supposed to have been the\r\nfirst to teach that the earth is spherical. So celebrated was he that\r\nit has been thought that a part of the favor in which the author of\r\nthe _Aeneid_ was held by medieval churchmen was due to a confusion\r\nbetween his name and that of the geometer, sometimes spoken of as St.\r\nVirgil.\r\n\r\nDicuil, also an Irish monk, was the author of a remarkable work on\r\ngeography, _De Mensura Provinciarum Orbis Terrae_, which was written\r\nin 825, and contains interesting references to Iceland and especially\r\nto the navigable canal which once connected the Nile with the Red\r\nSea. He wrote between 814 and 816 a work on astronomy which has never\r\nbeen published. It is probable, but not certain, that he belonged to\r\nClonmacnois.\r\n\r\nDungal, like the two others named above, was an astronomer. He\r\nprobably belonged to Bangor, and left his native land early in the\r\nninth century. In 811 he wrote a remarkable work, _Dungali Reclusi\r\nEpistola de duplici solis eclipsi anno 810 ad Carolum Magnum_. This\r\nletter, which is still extant, was written at the request of\r\nCharlemagne, who considered its author to be the most learned\r\nastronomer in existence and most likely to clear up the problem\r\nsubmitted to him.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the next period, a word should be said as to the\r\nmedieval physicians, often if not usually belonging to families of\r\nmedical men, such as the Leahys and O'Hickeys, and attached\r\nhereditarily to the greater clans. These men were chiefly compilers,\r\nbut such works of theirs as we have throw light upon the state of\r\nmedical knowledge in their day. Thus there is extant a treatise on\r\n_Materia Medica_ (1459); written by Cormac MacDuinntsleibhe\r\n(Dunleavy), hereditary physician to the clan of O'Donnell in Ulster.\r\nA more interesting work is the _Cursus Medicus_, consisting of six\r\nbooks on Physiology, three on Pathology, and four on Semeiotica,\r\nwritten in the reign of Charles I. of England by Nial O'Glacan, born\r\nin Donegal, and at one time physician to the king of France.\r\n\r\nO'Glacan's name introduces us to the middle period, if indeed it does\r\nnot belong there. _Inter arma silent leges_, and it may be added,\r\nscientific work. The troublous state of Ireland for many long years\r\nfully explains the absence of men of science in any abundance until\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century. Still there are three names which\r\ncan never be forgotten, belonging to the period in question. Sir Hans\r\nSloane was born at Killileagh, in Ulster, in 1660. He studied\r\nmedicine abroad, went to London where he settled, and was made a\r\nFellow of the Royal Society. He published a work on the West Indies,\r\nbut his claim to undying memory is the fact that it was the bequest\r\nof his most valuable and extensive collections to the nation which\r\nwas the beginning and foundation of the British Museum, perhaps the\r\nmost celebrated institution of its kind in the world. Sloane's\r\ncollection, it should be added, contained an immense number of\r\nvaluable books and manuscripts, as well as of objects more usually\r\nassociated with the idea of a museum. He died in 1753.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Robert Boyle was born at Lismore, in the county Waterford,\r\nin 1627, being the fourteenth child of the first Earl of Cork. On his\r\ntombstone he is described as \"The Father of Chemistry and the Uncle\r\nof the Earl of Cork\", and, indeed, in his _Skyptical Chimist_ (1661),\r\nhe assailed, and for the time overthrew, the idea of the alchemists\r\nthat there was a _materia prima_, asserting as he did that theory of\r\nchemical \"elements\" which held good until the discoveries in\r\nconnection with radium led to a modification in chemical teaching.\r\nThis may be said of Boyle, that his writings profoundly modified\r\nscientific opinion, and his name will always stand in the forefront\r\namongst those of chemists. He made important improvements in the\r\nair-pump, was one of the earliest Fellows of the Royal Society, and\r\nfounded the \"Boyle Lectures.\" He died in 1691.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Molyneux was born in Dublin, in 1661, of a family which\r\nhad settled in Ireland about 1560-70. He practised as a physician in\r\nhis native city, was the first person to describe the Irish Elk and\r\nto demonstrate the fact that the Giant's Causeway was a natural and\r\nnot, as had been previously supposed, an artificial production. He\r\nwas the author of many other scientific observations. He died in\r\n1733.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn to more recent times, and it will be convenient to\r\ndivide our subjects according to the branch of science in which they\r\nwere distinguished, and to commence with\r\n\r\nMATHEMATICIANS,\r\n\r\nof whom Ireland may boast of a most distinguished galaxy.\r\n\r\nSir William Rowan Hamilton (b. in Dublin 1805, d. 1865), belonged to\r\na family, long settled in Ireland, but of Scottish extraction. He was\r\na most precocious child. He read Hebrew at the age of seven, and at\r\ntwelve, had studied Latin, Greek, and four leading continental\r\nlanguages, as well as Persian, Syriac, Arabic, Sanscrit, and other\r\ntongues. In 1819 he wrote a letter to the Persian ambassador in that\r\nmagnate's own language. After these linguistic contests, he early\r\nturned to mathematics, in which he was apparently self-taught; yet,\r\nin his seventeenth year he discovered an error in Laplace's\r\n_Mécanique Céleste_. He entered Trinity College where he won all\r\nkinds of distinctions, being famous not merely as a mathematician,\r\nbut as a poet, a scholar, and a metaphysician. He was appointed\r\nProfessor of Astronomy and Astronomer Royal whilst still an\r\nundergraduate. He predicted \"conical refraction,\" afterwards\r\nexperimentally proved by another Irishman, Humphrey Lloyd. He twice\r\nreceived the Gold Medal of the Royal Society: (i) for optical\r\ndiscoveries; (ii) for his theory of a general method of dynamics,\r\nwhich resolves an extremely, abstruse problem relative to a system of\r\nbodies in motion. He was the discoverer of a new calculus, that of\r\nQuaternions, which attracted the attention of Professor Tait of\r\nEdinburgh, and was by him made comprehensible to lesser\r\nmathematicians. It is far too abstruse for description here.\r\n\r\nSir George Gabriel Stokes (born in Sligo 1819, d. 1903) was, if not\r\nthe greatest mathematician, at least among the greatest, of the last\r\nhundred years. He was educated in Cambridge, where he spent the rest\r\nof his life, being appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in\r\n1849, and celebrating the jubilee of that appointment in 1899. He was\r\nmember of parliament for his University, and for a time occupied the\r\npresidential chair of the Royal Society. He devoted himself, _inter\r\nalia_, to optical work, and is perhaps best known by those researches\r\nwhich deal with the undulatory theory of light. It was on this\r\nsubject that he delivered the Burnett lectures in Aberdeen\r\n(1883-1885).\r\n\r\nJames McCullagh, the son of a poor farmer, was born in Tyrone in\r\n1809, d. 1847. His early death, due to his own hand in a fit of\r\ninsanity, cut short his work, but enough remains to permit him to\r\nrank amongst the great mathematicians of all time, his most important\r\nwork being his memoir on surfaces of the second order.\r\n\r\nHumphrey Lloyd (b. in Dublin 1800, d. 1881), F.R.S. His father was\r\nProvost of Trinity College, Dublin, a position subsequently occupied\r\nalso by the son. Lloyd's work was chiefly concerned with optics and\r\nmagnetism, and it was in connection with the former that he carried\r\nout what was probably the most important single piece of work of his\r\nlife, namely, the experimental proof of the phenomenon of conical\r\nrefraction which had been predicted by Sir William Hamilton. He was\r\nresponsible for the erection of the Magnetic Observatory in Dublin,\r\nand the instruments used in it were constructed under his observation\r\nand sometimes from his designs or modifications. He was also a\r\nmeteorologist of distinction.\r\n\r\nGeorge Salmon (b. in Dublin 1819, d. 1904), like the last mentioned\r\nsubject, was, at the time of his death, Provost of Trinity College,\r\nDublin. Besides theological writings, he contributed much to\r\nmathematical science, especially in the directions of conic sections,\r\nanalytic geometry, higher plane curves, and the geometry of three\r\ndimensions. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and received the\r\nCopley and Royal medals, as well as distinctions from many\r\nuniversities and learned societies.\r\n\r\nJohn Casey (b. Kilkenny 1820, d. 1891), F.R.S., was educated at a\r\nNational School and became a teacher in one in later years. Entirely\r\nself-taught as a mathematician, he raised himself from the humble\r\nposition which he occupied to be a university professor (in the\r\nCatholic University of Ireland, and afterwards in the Royal\r\nUniversity), and earned the highest reputation as one of the greatest\r\nauthorities on plane geometry. He was a correspondent of eminent\r\nmathematicians all over the world.\r\n\r\nHenry Hennessey (b. in Cork 1826, d. 1901), F.R.S., was also a\r\nprofessor in the Catholic University of Ireland and afterwards in the\r\nRoyal College of Science in Dublin. He was a writer on mathematics,\r\nterrestrial physics, and climatology.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Williamson (b. in Cork 1827), F.R.S., is a Senior Fellow of\r\nTrinity College, Dublin, and a distinguished writer on mathematical\r\nsubjects, especially on the differential, integral, and infinitesimal\r\ncalculuses.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Larmor (b. in Antrim 1857), F.R.S., was educated at\r\nQueen's College, Belfast, and in Cambridge, in which last place he\r\nhas spent his life as a professor. He now represents the University\r\nin parliament and is secretary to the Royal Society. He is well-known\r\nfor his writings on the ether and on other physical as well as\r\nmathematical subjects.\r\n\r\nASTRONOMERS.\r\n\r\nWilliam Parsons, Earl of Rosse (b. in York 1800, d. 1867), F.R.S.,\r\nwas a very distinguished astronomer who experimented in fluid lenses\r\nand made great improvements in casting specula for reflecting\r\ntelescopes. From 1842-45 he was engaged upon the construction, in his\r\npark at Parsonstown, of his great reflecting telescope 58 feet long.\r\nThis instrument, which cost £30,000, long remained the largest in the\r\nworld. He was president of the Royal Society from 1848 to 1854.\r\n\r\nSir Howard Grubb (b. 1844), F.R.S., is known all over the world for\r\nhis telescopes and for the remarkable advances which he has made in\r\nthe construction of lenses for instruments of the largest size.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Ball (b. in Dublin 1840, d. 1913), F.R.S. Originally Lord\r\nRosse's astronomer at Parsonstown, he migrated as professor to\r\nTrinity College, Dublin, and subsequently became Lowndean Professor\r\nof Astronomy at Cambridge. He was a great authority on the\r\nmathematical theory of screws, and his popular works on astronomy\r\nhave made him known to a far wider circle of readers than those who\r\ncan grapple with his purely scientific treatises.\r\n\r\nWilliam Edward Wilson (b. Co. Westmeath 1851, d. 1908), F.R.S. A man\r\nof independent means, he erected, with the help of his father, an\r\nastronomical observatory at his residence. In this well-equipped\r\nbuilding he made many photographic researches, especially into the\r\nnature of nebulae. He also devoted himself to solar physics, and\r\nwrote some remarkable papers on the sudden appearance in 1903 of the\r\nstar Nova Persei. He was the first to call attention to the\r\nprobability that radium plays a part in the maintenance of solar\r\nheat. In fact, the science of radio-activity was engaging his keenest\r\ninterest at the time of his early death.\r\n\r\nA.A. Rambaut (b. Waterford 1859), F.R.S., formerly Astronomer Royal\r\nfor Ireland and now Radcliffe Observer at Oxford, is one of the\r\nleading astronomers of the day.\r\n\r\nPHYSICISTS.\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin, better known as Sir William Thompson (b. Belfast 1824,\r\nd. 1907), F.R.S. Amongst the greatest physicists who have ever lived,\r\nhis name comes second only to that of Newton. He was educated at\r\nCambridge, became professor of natural philosophy in Glasgow\r\nUniversity in 1846, and celebrated the jubilee of his appointment in\r\n1896. To the public his greatest achievement was the electric cabling\r\nof the Atlantic Ocean, for which he was knighted in 1866. His\r\nelectrometers and electric meters, his sounding apparatus, and his\r\nmariners' compass are all well-known and highly valued instruments.\r\nTo his scientific fellows, however, his greatest achievements were in\r\nthe field of pure science, especially in connection with his\r\nthermodynamic researches, including the doctrine of the dissipation\r\nor degradation of energy. To this brief statement may be added\r\nmention of his work in connection with hydrodynamics and his magnetic\r\nand electric discoveries. His papers in connection with wave and\r\nvortex movements are also most remarkable. He was awarded the Royal\r\nand Copley medals and was an original member of the Order of Merit.\r\nHe received distinctions from many universities and learned\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nGeorge Francis Fitzgerald (b. Dublin 1851, d. 1901), F.R.S., was\r\nfellow and professor of natural philosophy in Trinity College,\r\nDublin, where he was educated. He was the first person to call the\r\nattention of the world to the importance of Hertz's experiment.\r\nPerhaps his most important work, interrupted by his labors in\r\nconnection with education and terminated by his early death, was that\r\nin connection with the nature of the ether.\r\n\r\nGeorge Johnston Stoney (b. King's Co. 1826, d. 1911), F.R.S., after\r\nbeing astronomer at Parsonstown and professor of natural philosophy\r\nat Galway, became secretary to the Queen's University and occupied\r\nthat position until the dissolution of the university in 1882. He\r\nwrote many papers on geometrical optics and on molecular physics, but\r\nhis great claim to remembrance is that he first suggested, \"on the\r\nbasis of Faraday's law of Electrolysis, that an absolute unit of\r\nquantity of electricity exists in that amount of it which attends\r\neach chemical bond or valency and gave the name, now generally\r\nadopted, of electron to this small quantity.\" He proposed the\r\nelectronic theory of the origin of the complex ether vibrations which\r\nproceed from a molecule emitting light.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyndall (b. Leighlin Bridge, Co. Carlow, 1820, d. 1893), F.R.S.,\r\nprofessor at the Royal Institution and a fellow-worker in many ways\r\nwith Huxley, especially on the subject of glaciers. He wrote also on\r\nheat as a mode of motion and was the author of many scientific\r\npapers, but will, perhaps, be best remembered as the author of a\r\nPresidential Address to the British Association in Belfast (1874),\r\nwhich was the highwater mark of the mid-Victorian materialism at its\r\nmost triumphant moment.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTS.\r\n\r\nRichard Kirwan (b. Galway 1733, d. 1812), F.R.S. A man of independent\r\nmeans, he devoted himself to the study of chemistry and mineralogy\r\nand was awarded the Copley medal of the Royal Society. He published\r\nworks on mineralogy and on the analysis of mineral waters, and was\r\nthe first in Ireland to publish analyses of soils for agricultural\r\npurposes, a research which laid the foundation of scientific\r\nagriculture in Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nMaxwell Simpson (b. Armagh 1815, d. 1902), F.R.S., held the chair of\r\nchemistry in Queen's College, Cork, for twenty years and published a\r\nnumber of papers in connection with his subject and especially with\r\nthe behavior of cyanides, with the study of which compounds his name\r\nis most associated.\r\n\r\nCornelius O'Sullivan (b. Brandon, 1841, d. 1897), F.R.S., was for\r\nmany years chemist to the great firm of Bass & Co., brewers at\r\nBurton-on-Trent, and in that capacity became one of the leading\r\nexponents of the chemistry of fermentation in the world.\r\n\r\nJames Emerson Reynolds (b. Dublin 1844), F.R.S., professor of\r\nchemistry, Trinity College, Dublin, for many years, discovered the\r\nprimary thiocarbamide and a number of other chemical substances,\r\nincluding a new class of colloids and several groups of organic and\r\nother compounds of the element silicon.\r\n\r\nAmong others only the names of the following can be mentioned:--Sir\r\nRobert Kane (b. Dublin 1809, d. 1890), professor of chemistry in\r\nDublin and founder and first director of the Museum of Industry, now\r\nthe National Museum. He was president of Queen's College, Cork, as\r\nwas William K. Sullivan (b. Cork 1822, d. 1890), formerly professor\r\nof chemistry in the Catholic University. Sir William O'Shaughnessy\r\nBrooke, F.R.S. (b. Limerick 1809, d. 1889), professor of chemistry\r\nand assay master in Calcutta, is better known as the introducer of\r\nthe telegraphic system into India and its first superintendent.\r\n\r\nBIOLOGISTS.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Harvey (b. Limerick 1814, d. 1866), F.R.S., was a\r\nbotanist of very great distinction. During a lengthy residence in\r\nSouth Africa, he made a careful study of the flora of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope and published _The Genera of South African Plants_. After\r\nthis he was made keeper of the Herbarium, Trinity College, Dublin,\r\nbut, obtaining leave of absence, travelled in North and South\r\nAmerica, exploring the coast from Halifax to the Keys of Florida, in\r\norder to collect materials for his great work, _Nereis\r\nBoreali-Americana_, published by the Smithsonian Institution.\r\nSubsequently he visited Ceylon, Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and\r\nthe Friendly and Fiji Islands, collecting algae. The results were\r\npublished in his _Phycologia Australis_. At the time of his death he\r\nwas engaged on his _Flora Capensis_, and was generally considered the\r\nfirst authority on algae in the world.\r\n\r\nWilliam Archer (b. Co. Down 1837, d. 1897), F.R.S., devoted his life\r\nto the microscopic examination of freshwater organisms, especially\r\ndesmids and diatoms. He attained a very prominent place in this\r\nbranch of work among men of science. Perhaps his most remarkable\r\ndiscovery was that of Chlamydomyxa labyrinthuloides (in 1868), \"one\r\nof the most remarkable and enigmatical of all known microscopic\r\norganisms.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge James Allman (b. Cork 1812, d. 1898), F.R.S., professor of\r\nbotany in Trinity College, Dublin, and afterwarls Regius Professor of\r\nnatural history in the University of Edinburgh, published many papers\r\non botanical and zoological subjects, but his great work was that on\r\nthe gymnoblastic Hydrozoa, \"without doubt the most important\r\nsystematic work dealing with the group of Coelenterata that has ever\r\nbeen produced.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst eminent living members of the class under consideration may\r\nbe mentioned Alexander Macalister (b. Dublin 1844), F.R.S., professor\r\nof anatomy, first in Dublin and now in Cambridge, an eminent\r\nmorphologist and anthropologist, and Henry Horatio Dixon (b. Dublin),\r\nF.R.S., professor of botany in Trinity College, an authority on\r\nvegetable physiology, especially problems dealing with the sap.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGISTS.\r\n\r\nSamuel Haughton (b. Carlow 1821, d. 1897), F.R.S., after earning a\r\nconsiderable reputation as a mathematician and a geologist, and\r\ntaking Anglican orders, determined to study medicine and entered the\r\nschool of that subject in Trinity College. After graduating he became\r\nthe reformer, it might even be said the re-founder, of that school.\r\nHe devoted ten years to the study of the mechanical principles of\r\nmuscular action, and published his _Animal Mechanism_, probably his\r\ngreatest work. He will long be remembered as the introducer of the\r\n\"long drop\" as a method of capital execution. He might have been\r\nplaced in several of the categories which have been dealt with, but\r\nthat of geologist has been selected, since in the later part of his\r\nmost versatile career he was professor of geology in Trinity College,\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\nValentine Ball (b. Dublin 1843, d. 1894), F.R.S., a brother of Sir\r\nRobert, joined the Geological Survey of India, and in that capacity\r\nbecame an authority not only on geology but also on ornithology and\r\nanthropology. His best known work is _Jungle-Life in India_. In later\r\nlife he was director of the National Museum, Dublin.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nVery brief note can be taken of the many shining lights in Irish\r\nmedical science. Robert James Graves (1796-1853), F.R.S., after whom\r\nis named \"Graves's Disease\", was one of the greatest of clinical\r\nphysicians. His _System of Clinical Medicine_ was a standard work and\r\nwas extolled by Trousseau, the greatest physician that France has\r\never had, in the highest terms of appreciation.\r\n\r\nWilliam Stokes (1804-1878), Regius Professor of Medicine in Trinity\r\nCollege, and the author of a _Theory and Practice of Medicine_, known\r\nall over the civilized world, was equally celebrated.\r\n\r\nTo these must be added Sir Dominic Corrigan (1802-1880), the first\r\nCatholic to occupy the position of President of the College of\r\nPhysicians in Dublin, an authority on heart disease, and the first\r\nadequate describer of aortic patency, a form of ailment long called\r\n\"Corrigan's Disease\". \"Colles's Fracture\" is a familiar term in the\r\nmouths of surgeons. It derives its name from Abraham Colles\r\n(1773-1843), the first surgeon in the world to tie the innominate\r\nartery, as \"Butcher's Saw\", a well-known implement, does from another\r\neminent surgeon; Richard Butcher, Regius Professor in Trinity College\r\nin the seventies of the last century.\r\n\r\nSir Rupert Boyce (1863-1911), F.R.S., though born in London, had an\r\nIrish father and mother. Entering the medical profession, he was\r\nassistant professor of pathology at University College, London, and\r\nsubsequently professor of pathology in University College, Liverpool,\r\nwhich he was largely instrumental in turning into the University of\r\nLiverpool. He was foremost in launching and directing the Liverpool\r\nSchool of Tropical Medicine, which has had such widespread results\r\nall over the world in elucidating the problems and checking the\r\nravages of the diseases peculiar to hot countries. It was for his\r\nservices in this direction that he was knighted in 1906.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Quain (b. Mallow 1816, d. 1898), F.R.S., spent most of\r\nhis life in London, where he was for years the most prominent\r\nphysician. He wrote on many subjects, but the _Dictionary of\r\nMedicine_, which he edited and which bears his name, has made itself\r\nand its editor known all over the world.\r\n\r\nSir Almroth Wright (b. 1861), F.R.S., is the greatest living\r\nauthority on the important subject of vaccino-therapy, which, indeed,\r\nmay be said to owe its origin to his researches, as do the methods\r\nfor measuring the protective substances in the human blood. He was\r\nthe discoverer of the anti-typhoid injection which has done so much\r\nto stay the ravages of that disease.\r\n\r\nENGINEERING.\r\n\r\nBindon Blood Stoney (1828-1909), F.R.S., made his reputation first as\r\nan astronomer by discovering the spiral character of the great nebula\r\nin Andromeda. Turning to engineering, he was responsible for the\r\nconstruction of many important works, especially in connection with\r\nthe port of Dublin. He was brother of G. J. Stoney.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Parsons (b. 1854), F.R.S., fourth son of the third Earl\r\nof Rosse, is the engineer who developed the steam turbine system and\r\nmade it suitable for the generation of electricity, and for the\r\npropulsion of war and mercantile vessels. If he has revolutionized\r\ntraffic on the water, so on the land has John Boyd Dunlop (still\r\nliving), who discovered the pneumatic tire with such wide-spread\r\nresults for motorcars, bicycles, and such means of locomotion.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Sir Leopold McClintock (b. Dundalk 1819, d. 1907), F.R.S.,\r\nwas one of the great Arctic explorers, having spent eleven navigable\r\nseasons and six winters in those regions. He was the chief leader and\r\norganizer of the Franklin searches. From the scientific point of view\r\nhe made a valuable collection of miocene fossils from Greenland, and\r\nenabled Haughton to prepare the geological map and memoir of the\r\nParry Archipelago.\r\n\r\nJohn Ball (b. Dublin 1818, d. 1889), F.R.S., educated at Oscott,\r\npassed the examination for a high degree at Cambridge, but, being a\r\nCatholic, was excluded from the degree itself and any other honors\r\nwhich a Protestant might have attained to. He travelled widely and\r\npublished many works on the natural history of Europe and South\r\nAmerica from Panama to Tierra del Fuego. He was the first to suggest\r\nthe utilization of the electric telegraph for meteorological purposes\r\nconnected with storm warnings.\r\n\r\nSpace ought to be found for a cursory mention of that strange person,\r\nDionysius Lardner (1793-1859), who by his _Lardner's Cyclopaedia_ in\r\n132 vols., his _Cabinet Library_, and his _Museum of Science and\r\nArt_, did much to popularize science in an unscientific day.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nThe principal sources of information are the National Dictionary of\r\nBiography; the Obituary Notices of the Royal Society (passages in\r\ninverted commas are from these); \"Who's Who\" (for living persons);\r\nHealy: Ireland's Ancient Schools and Scholars; Hyde: Literary History\r\nof Ireland; Joyce: Social History of Ancient Ireland; Moore: Medicine\r\nin the British Isles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW IN IRELAND\r\n\r\nBy LAURENCE GINNELL, B.L., M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISTINCTION. Ireland having been a self-ruled country for a stretch\r\nof some two thousand years, then violently brought under subjection\r\nto foreign rule, regaining legislative independence for a brief\r\nperiod toward the close of the eighteenth century, then by violence\r\nand corruption deprived of that independence and again brought under\r\nthe same foreign rule, to which it is still subject, the expression\r\n\"Law in Ireland\" comprises the native and the foreign, the laws\r\ndevised by the Irish Nation for its own governance and the laws\r\nimposed upon it from without: two sets, codes, or systems proper to\r\ntwo entirely distinct social structures having no relation and but\r\nlittle resemblance to each other. Whatever may be thought of either\r\nas law, the former is Irish in every sense, and vastly the more\r\ninteresting historically, archaeologically, philologically, and in\r\nmany other ways; the latter being English law in Ireland, and not\r\ntruly Irish in any sense.\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF IRISH LAW. _Seanchus agus Féineachus na\r\nhEireann_ == _Hiberniae Antiquitates et Sanctiones Legales_--The\r\nAncient Laws and Decisions of the _Féini_, of Ireland. _Sen_ or\r\n_sean_ (pronounced shan) == \"old,\" differs from most Gaelic\r\nadjectives in preceding the noun it qualifies. It also tends to\r\ncoalesce and become a prefix. _Seanchus_ (shanech-us) == \"ancient\r\nlaw.\" _Féineachus_ (fainech-us) == the law of the _Féini_, who were\r\nthe Milesian farmers, free members of the clans, the most important\r\nclass in the ancient Irish community. Their laws were composed in\r\ntheir contemporary language, the _Bearla Féini_, a distinct form of\r\nGaelic. Several nations of the Aryan race are known to have cast into\r\nmetre or rhythmical prose their laws and such other knowledge as they\r\ndesired to communicate, preserve, and transmit, before writing came\r\ninto use. The Irish went further and, for greater facility in\r\ncommitting to memory and retaining there, put their laws into a kind\r\nof rhymed verse, of which they may have been the inventors. By this\r\ndevice, aided by the isolated geographical position of Ireland, the\r\nsanctity of age, and the apprehension that any change of word or\r\nphrase might change the law itself, these archaic laws, when\r\nsubsequently committed to writing, were largely preserved from the\r\nprogressive changes to which all spoken languages are subject, with\r\nthe result that we have today, embedded in the Gaelic text and\r\ncommentaries of the _Senchus Mór_, the _Book of Aicill_, and other\r\nlaw works, available in English translations made under a Royal\r\nCommission appointed by Government in 1852, and published, at\r\nintervals extending over forty years, in six volumes of \"Ancient Laws\r\nand Institutions of Ireland,\" a mass of archaic words, phrases, law,\r\nliterature, and information on the habits and manners of the people,\r\nnot equalled in antiquity, quantity, or authenticity in any other\r\nCeltic source. In English they are commonly called Brehon Laws, from\r\nthe genitive case singular of _Brethem_ = \"judge\", genitive\r\n_Brethemain_ (pronounced brehun), as Erin is an oblique case of Eire,\r\nand as Latin words are sometimes adopted in the genitive in modern\r\nlanguages which themselves have no case distinctions. It is not to be\r\ninferred from this name that the laws are judge-made. They are rather\r\ncase law, in parts possibly enacted by some of the various assemblies\r\nat which the laws were promulgated or rehearsed, but for the most\r\npart simple declarations of law originating in custom and moral\r\njustice, and records of judgments based upon \"the precedents and\r\ncommentaries\", in the sort of cases common to agricultural\r\ncommunities of the time, many of the provisions being as inapplicable\r\nto modern life as modern laws would be to ancient life. A reader is\r\nimpressed by the extraordinary number and variety of cases with their\r\nstill more numerous details and circumstances accumulated in the\r\ncourse of long ages, the manner in which the laws are inextricably\r\ninterwoven with the interlocking clan system, and the absence of\r\nscientific arrangement or guiding principle except those of moral\r\njustice, clemency, and the good of the community. This defect in\r\narrangement is natural in writings intended, as these were, for the\r\nuse of judges and professors, experts in the subjects with which they\r\ndeal, but makes the task of presenting a concise statement of them\r\ndifficult and uncertain.\r\n\r\nSOCIETY LAW. The law and the social system were inseparable parts of\r\na complicated whole, mutually cause and consequence of each other.\r\n_Tuath, clann, cinel, cine_, and _fine_ (pronounced thooah, clong,\r\nkinnel, kineh, and fin-yeh) were terms used to denote a tribe or set\r\nof relatives, in reality or by adoption, claiming descent from a\r\ncommon ancestor, forming a community occupying and owning a given\r\nterritory. _Tuath_ in course of time came to be applied indifferently\r\nto the people and to their territory. _Fine_, sometimes designating a\r\nwhole tribe, more frequently meant a part of it, occupying a distinct\r\nportion of the territory, a potential microcosm or nucleus of a clan,\r\nhaving limited autonomy in the conduct of its own immediate affairs.\r\nThe constitution of this organism, whether as contemplated by the law\r\nor in the less perfect actual practice, is alike elusive, and\r\nunderwent changes. For the purpose of illustration, the _fine_ may be\r\nsaid to consist, theoretically, of the \"seventeen men\" frequently\r\nmentioned throughout the laws, namely, the _flaithfine_ = chief of\r\nthe _fine_; the _geilfine_ = his four fullgrown sons or other nearest\r\nmale relatives; the _deirbhfine, tarfine_, and _innfine_, each\r\nconsisting of four heads of families in wider concentric circles of\r\nkinship, say first, second, and third cousins of the _flaithfine_.\r\nThe _fine_ was liable, in measure determined by those circles, for\r\ncontracts, fines, and damages incurred by any of its members so far\r\nas his own property was insufficient, and was in the same degree\r\nentitled to share advantages of a like kind accruing. Intermarriage\r\nwithin this _fine_ was prohibited. The modern term \"sept\" is applied\r\nsometimes to this group and sometimes to a wider group united under a\r\n_flaith_ (flah) = \"chief\", elected by the _flaithfines_ and provided,\r\nfor his public services, with free land proportionate to the area of\r\nthe district and the number of clansmen in it. _Clann_ might mean the\r\nwhole Irish nation, or an intermediate homogeneous group of _fines_\r\nhaving for wider purposes a _flaith_ or _ri-tuatha_ = king of one\r\n_tuath_, elected by the _flaiths_ and _flaithfines_, subject to\r\nelaborate qualifications as to person, character, and training, which\r\nlimited their choice, and provided with a larger portion of free\r\nland. This was the lowest chief to whom the title _ri, righ_ (both\r\npr. ree) = _rex_, or \"king\", was applied. A group of these kinglets\r\nconnected by blood or territory or policy, and their _flaiths_,\r\nelected, from a still narrower circle of specially trained men within\r\ntheir own rank, the _ri-mor-tuatha_--king of the territory so\r\ncomposed, to whose office a still larger area of free land was\r\nattached. In turn, kings of this class, with their respective\r\nsub-kings and _flaiths_, elected from among the _riogh-dhamhna_\r\n(ree-uch-dhowna) = _materia principum_ or \"king-timber\", a royal\r\n_fine_ specially educated and trained, a _rì-cuighidh_ (ree\r\ncoo-ee-hee) supreme over five _ri-mor-tuathas_--roughly, a fourth of\r\nIreland. These, with their respective principal supporters, elected\r\nthe _ard-ri_--\"supreme king\", of Ireland, who for ages held his court\r\nand national assemblies at Tara and enjoyed the kingdom of Meath for\r\nhis mensal land. Usually the election was not direct to the kingship,\r\nbut to the position of _tanaiste_--\"second\" (in authority),\r\nheir-apparent to the kingship. This was also the rule in the learned\r\nprofessions and \"noble\" arts, which were similarly endowed with free\r\nland. The most competent among those specially trained, whether son\r\nor outsider, should succeed to the position and land. All such land\r\nwas legally indivisible and inalienable and descended in its entirety\r\nto the successor, who might, or might not, be a relative of the\r\noccupant. The beneficiaries were, however, free to retain any land\r\nthat belonged to them as private individuals.\r\n\r\nMembership of the clan was an essential qualification for every\r\nposition; but occasionally two clans amalgamated, or a small _fine_,\r\nor desirable individual, was co-opted into the clan--in other words,\r\nnaturalized. The rules of kinship determined _eineachlann_\r\n(ain-yach-long)--\"honor value\", the assessed value of status, with\r\nits correlative rights, obligations, and liabilities in connection\r\nwith all matters civil and criminal; largely supplied the place of\r\ncontract; endowed members of the clan with birthrights; and bound\r\nthem into a compact social, political, and mutual insurance\r\ncopartnership, self-controlled and self-reliant. _Eineachlann_ rested\r\non the two-fold basis of kinship and property, expanding as a\r\nclansman by acquisition of property and effluxion of time progressed\r\nupward from one grade to another; diminishing if he sank; vanishing\r\nif for crime he was expelled from the clan.\r\n\r\nFOSTERAGE. To our minds, one of the most curious customs prevalent\r\namong the ancient Irish was that of _iarrad_, called also _altar_ =\r\n\"fosterage\"--curious in itself and in the fact that in all the\r\nabundance of law and literature relating to it no logically valid\r\nreason is given why wealthy parents normally put out their children,\r\nfrom one year old to fifteen in the case of a daughter and to\r\nseventeen in the case of a son, to be reared in another family, while\r\nperhaps receiving and rearing children of other parents sent to them.\r\nAs modern life does not comprise either the custom or a reason for\r\nit, we may assume that fosterage was a consequence of the clan\r\nsystem, and that its practice strengthened the ties of kinship and\r\nsympathy. This conjecture is corroborated by the numerous instances\r\nin history and in story of fosterage affection proving, when tested,\r\nstronger than the natural affection of relatives by birth. What is\r\nmore, long after the dissolution of the clans, fosterage has\r\ncontinued stealthily in certain districts in which the old race of\r\nchiefs and clansmen contrived to cling together to the old sod; and\r\nthe affection generated by it has been demonstrated, down to the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century. The present writer has heard it\r\nspoken of lovingly, in half-Irish, by simple old people, whom to\r\nquestion would be cruel and irreverent.\r\n\r\nLAND LAW. The entire territory was originally, and always continued\r\nto be, the absolute property of the entire clan. Not even the private\r\nresidence of a clansman, with its _maighin digona_ = little lawn or\r\nprecinct of sanctuary, within which himself and his family and\r\nproperty were inviolable, could be sold to an outsider. Private\r\nownership, though rather favored in the administration of the law,\r\nwas prevented from becoming general by the fundamental ownership of\r\nthe clan and the birthright of every free-born clansman to a\r\nsufficiency of the land of his native territory for his subsistence.\r\nThe land officially held as described was not, until the population\r\nbecame numerous, a serious encroachment upon this right. What\r\nremained outside this and the residential patches of private land was\r\nclassified as cultivable and uncultivable. The former was the common\r\nproperty of the clansmen, but was held and used in severalty for the\r\ntime being, subject to _gabhail-cine_ (gowal-kinneh)--clan-resumption\r\nand redistribution by authority of an assembly of the clan or _fine_\r\nat intervals of from one to three years, according to local customs\r\nand circumstances, for the purpose of satisfying the rights of young\r\nclansmen and dealing with any land left derelict by death or\r\nforfeiture, compensation being paid for any unexhausted improvements.\r\nThe clansmen, being owners in this limited sense, and the only\r\nowners, had no rent to pay. They paid tribute for public purposes,\r\nsuch as the making of roads, to the _flaith_ as a public officer, as\r\nthey were bound to render, or had the privilege of\r\nrendering--according to how they regarded it--military service when\r\nrequired, not to the _flaith_ as a feudal lord, which he was not, but\r\nto the clan, of which the _flaith_ was head and representative.\r\n\r\nThe uncultivable, unreclaimed forest, mountain, and bog-land was\r\ncommon property in the wider sense that there was no several\r\nappropriation of it even temporarily by individuals. It was used\r\npromiscuously by the clansmen for grazing stock, procuring fuel,\r\npursuing game, or any other advantage yielded by it in its natural\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nKings and _flaiths_ were great stock-owners, and were allowed to let\r\nfor short terms portions of their official lands. What they more\r\nusually let to clansmen was cattle to graze either on private land or\r\non a specified part of the official land, not measured, but\r\ncalculated according to the number of beasts it was able to support.\r\nA _flaith_ whose stock for letting ran short hired some from a king\r\nand sublet them to his own people. A _féine, aithech_, or _ceile_\r\n(kailyeh), as a farmer was generally called, might hire stock in one\r\nof two distinct ways: _saer_-\"free\", which was regulated by the law,\r\nleft his status unimpaired, could not be terminated arbitrarily or\r\nunjustly, under which he paid one-third of the value of the stock\r\nyearly for seven years, at the end of which time what remained of the\r\nstock became his property, and in any dispute relating to which he\r\nwas competent to sue or defend even though the _flaith_ gave\r\nevidence; or _daer_--\"bond\", which was matter of bargain and not of\r\nlaw, was subject to onerous conditions and contingencies, including\r\nmaintenance of kings, _flaiths_, or brehons, with their retinues, on\r\nvisitations, of disbanded soldiers, etc., under which the stock\r\nalways remained the property of the _flaith_, regarding which the\r\n_ceile_ could not give evidence against that of the _flaith_, which\r\ndegraded the _ceile_ and his _fine_ and impaired their status; a\r\nbargain therefore which could not be entered into without the\r\nsanction of the _fine_. This prohibition was rendered operative by\r\nthe legal provision that in case of default the _flaith_ could not\r\nrecover from the _fine_ unless their consent had been obtained. The\r\nletting of stock, especially of _daer_-stock, increased the\r\n_flaith's_ power as a lender over borrowers, subject, however, to the\r\ncheck that his rank and _eineachlann_ depended on the number of\r\nindependent clansmen in his district.\r\n\r\nThough workers in precious metals, as their ornaments show, the\r\nancient Irish did not coin or use money. Sales were by barter. All\r\npayments, tribute, rent, fulfilment of contract, fine, damages,\r\nwages, or however else arising, were made in kind--horses, cows,\r\nstore cattle, sheep, pigs, corn, meal, malt, bacon, salt beef, geese,\r\nbutter, honey, wool, flax, yarn, cloth, dye-plants, leather,\r\nmanufactured articles of use or ornament, gold, and silver--whatever\r\none party could spare and the other find a use for.\r\n\r\nTributes and rent, being alike paid in kind and to the same person,\r\nwere easily confused. This tempted the _flaith_, as the system\r\nrelaxed, to extend his official power in the direction of ownership;\r\nbut never to the extent of enabling him to evict a clansman. For a\r\ncrime a clansman might be expelled from clan and territory; but,\r\napart from crime, the idea of eviction from one's homestead was\r\ninconceivable. Not even when a _daer-ceile_, or \"unfree peasant\",\r\nfailed to make the stipulated payments could the _flaith_ do more\r\nthan sue as for any other debt; and, if successful, he was bound, in\r\nseizing, to leave the family food-material and implements necessary\r\nfor living and recovering.\r\n\r\nLAW OF DISTRAINING. _Athgabail_ ([)a]h-gowil) = \"distress\", was the\r\nuniversal legal mode of obtaining anything due, or justice or redress\r\nin any matter, whether civil or criminal, contract or tort. Every\r\ncommand or prohibition of the law, if not obeyed, was enforced by\r\n_athgabail_. The brehons reduced all liabilities of whatsoever origin\r\nto material value to be recovered by this means. Hence its great\r\nimportance, the vast amount of space devoted to it in the laws, and\r\nthe fact that the law of distress deals incidentally with every other\r\nbranch of law and reveals best the customs, habits, and character of\r\nthe people. A claimant in a civil case might either summon his debtor\r\nbefore a brehon, get a judgment, and seize the amount adjudged, or,\r\nby distraining first at his own risk, force the defendant either to\r\npay or stop the seizure by submitting the matter in dispute to trial\r\nbefore a brehon, whom he then could choose. There was no officer\r\ncorresponding to a sheriff to distrain and realize the amount\r\nadjudged; the person entitled had to do it himself, accompanied by a\r\nlaw-agent and witnesses, after, in \"distress with time\", elaborate\r\nnotices at intervals of time sufficient to allow the defendant to\r\nconsider his position and find means of satisfying the claim if he\r\ncould. In a proper case his hands were strengthened by very explicit\r\nprovisions of the law. \"If a man who is sued evades justice, knowing\r\nthe debt to be due of him, double the debt is payable by him.\" In\r\nurgent cases \"immediate distress\" was allowed. In either case the\r\nproperty seized--usually cattle--was not taken to the plaintiff's\r\nhome, but put into a pound, and by similar easy stages became his\r\nproperty to the amount of the debt. The costs were paid out of what\r\nremained, and any ultimate remainder was returned. On a _fuidir_\r\n(foodyir) = serf or other unfree person resident in the territory\r\nincurring liability to a clansman, the latter might proceed against\r\nthe _flaith_ on whose land the defendant lived, or might seize\r\nimmediately any property the defendant owned, and if he owned none,\r\nmight seize him and make him work off the debt in slavery.\r\n\r\nSeizure of property of a person of higher rank than the plaintiff had\r\nto be preceded by _troscead_ (truscah) = fasting upon him. This\r\nconsisted in waiting at the door of the defendant's residence without\r\nfood until the debt was paid or a pledge given. The laws contained no\r\nprocess more strongly enforced than this. A defendant who allowed a\r\nplaintiff properly fasting to die of hunger was held by law and by\r\npublic opinion guilty of murder, and completely lost his\r\n_eineachlann_. Both text and commentary declare that whoever refuses\r\nto cede a just demand when fasted upon shall pay double that amount.\r\nIf the faster, having accepted a pledge, did not in due course\r\nreceive satisfaction of his claim, he forthwith distrained, taking\r\nand keeping double the amount of the debt. The law did not allow\r\nthose whom it at first respected to trifle with justice.\r\n\r\n_Troscead_ is believed to have been of druidical origin, and it\r\nretained throughout, even in Christian times, a sort of supernatural\r\nsignificance. Whoever disregarded it became an outcast and incurred\r\nrisks and dangers too grave to be lightly faced. Besides being a\r\nlegal process, it was resorted to as a species of elaborate prayer,\r\nor curse,--a kind of magic for achieving some difficult purpose. This\r\nmysterious character enhanced its value in a legal system deficient\r\nin executive power.\r\n\r\nNON-CITIZENS. From what precedes it will be understood that there\r\nwere in ancient Ireland from prehistoric times people not comprised\r\nin the clan organization, and therefore not enjoying its rights and\r\nadvantages or entitled to any of its land, some of whom were\r\notherwise free within certain areas, while some were serfs and some\r\nslaves. Those outsiders are conjectured to have originated in the\r\nearlier colonists subdued by the Milesians and reduced to an inferior\r\ncondition. But the distinction did not wholly follow racial lines.\r\nPersons of pre-Milesian race are known to have risen to eminence,\r\nwhile Milesians are known to have sunk, from crime or other causes,\r\nto the lowest rank of the unfree. Here and there a _daer-tuath_ =\r\n\"bond community\", of an earlier race held together down to the Middle\r\nAges in districts in which conquest had left them and to which they\r\nwere restricted. Beyond that restriction, exclusion from the clan and\r\nits power, some peculiarities of dialect, dress, and manners, and a\r\ntradition of inferiority such as still exists in certain parishes,\r\nthey were not molested, provided they paid tribute, which may have\r\nbeen heavy.\r\n\r\nThere were also _bothachs_ = cottiers, and _sen-cleithes_ = old\r\nadherents of a _flaith_, accustomed to serve him and obtain benefits\r\nfrom him. If they had resided in the territory for three generations,\r\nand been industrious, thrifty, and orderly, on a few of them joining\r\ntheir property together to the number of one hundred head of cattle,\r\nthey could emancipate themselves by appointing a _flaithfine_ and\r\ngetting admitted to the clan. Till this was done, they could neither\r\nsue nor defend nor inherit, and the _flaith_ was answerable for their\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nThere being no prisons or convict settlements, any person of whatever\r\nrace convicted of grave crime, or of cowardice on the field of\r\nbattle, and unable to pay the fines imposed, captives taken in\r\nforeign wars, fugitives from other clans, and tramps, fell into the\r\nlowest ranks of the _fuidre_--\"serfs.\" It was as a captive that Saint\r\nPatrick was brought in his youth to Ireland. The law allowed, rather\r\nthan entitled, a _flaith_ to keep unfree people for servile\r\noccupations and the performance of unskilled labor for the public\r\nbenefit. In reality they worked for his personal profit, oftentimes\r\nat the expense of the clan. They lived on his land, and he was\r\nresponsible for their conduct. By analogy, the distinctions _saer_\r\nand _daer_ were recognized among them, according to origin,\r\ncharacter, and means. Where these elements continued to be favorable\r\nfor three generations, progress upward was made; and ultimately a\r\nnumber of them could club together, appoint a _flaithfine_, and apply\r\nto be admitted to the clan.\r\n\r\nA _mog_ was a slave in the strict sense, usually purchased as such\r\nfrom abroad, and legally and socially lower than the lowest _fuidir_.\r\nGiraldus Cambrensis, writing towards the close of the twelfth\r\ncentury, tells us that English parents then frequently sold their\r\nsurplus children and other persons to the Irish as slaves. The Church\r\nrepeatedly intervened for the release of captives and mitigation of\r\ntheir condition. The whole institution of slavery was strongly\r\ncondemned as un-Christian by the Synod held in Armagh in 1171.\r\n\r\nCRIMINAL LAW. Though there are numerous laws relating to crime, to be\r\nfound chiefly in the _Book of Aicill_, criminal law in the sense of a\r\ncode of punishment there was none. The law took cognizance of crime\r\nand wrong of every description against person, character, and\r\nproperty; and its function was to prevent and restrict crime, and\r\nwhen committed to determine, according to the facts of the case and\r\nthe respective ranks of the parties, the value of the compensation or\r\nreparation that should be made. It treated crime as a mode of\r\nincurring liability; entitled the sufferer, or, if he was murdered,\r\nhis _fine_, to bring the matter before a brehon, who, on hearing the\r\ncase, made the complicated calculations and adjustments rendered\r\nnecessary by the facts proved and by the grades to which the\r\nrespective parties belonged, arrived at and gave judgment for the\r\namount of the compensation, armed with which judgment, the plaintiff\r\ncould immediately distrain for that amount the property of the\r\ncriminal, and, in his default, that of his _fine_. The _fine_ could\r\nescape part of its liability by arresting and giving up the convict,\r\nor by expelling him and giving substantial security against his\r\nfuture misdeeds.\r\n\r\nFrom the number of elements that entered into the calculation of a\r\nfine, it necessarily resulted that like fines by no means followed\r\nlike crimes. Fines, like all other payments, were adjudged and paid\r\nin kind, being, in some cases of the destruction of property,\r\ngeneric--a quantity of that kind of property. Large fines were\r\nusually adjudged to be paid in three species, one-third in each, the\r\nplaintiff taking care to inform correctly the brehon of the kinds of\r\nproperty the defendant possessed, because he could seize only that\r\nnamed, and if the defendant did not possess it, the judgment was \"a\r\nblind nut.\" Crime against the State or community, such as wilful\r\ndisturbance of an assembly, was punished severely. These were the\r\nonly cases to which the law attached a sentence of death or other\r\ncorporal punishment. For nothing whatsoever between parties did the\r\nlaw recognize any duty of revenge, retaliation, or the infliction of\r\npersonal punishment, but only the payment of compensation. Personal\r\npunishment was regarded as the commission of a second crime on\r\naccount of a first. There was no duty to do this; but the right to do\r\nit was tacitly recognized if a criminal resisted or evaded payment of\r\nan adjudged compensation. Criminal were distinguished from civil\r\ncases only by the moral element, the sufferer's right in all cases to\r\nchoose a brehon, the loss of _eineachlann_, partial or whole\r\naccording to the magnitude of the crime, the elements used in\r\ncalculating the amount of fine, and the technical terms employed.\r\n_Dire_ (djeereh) was a general name for a fine, and there were\r\nspecific names for classes of fines. _Eric_ = reparation, redemption,\r\nwas the fine for killing a human being, the amount being affected by\r\nthe distinction between murder and manslaughter and by other\r\ncircumstances; but in no case was a violent death, however innocent,\r\nallowed to pass without reparation being made. A fine was awarded out\r\nof the property of the convict or of his _fine_ to the _fine_ of the\r\nperson slain, in the proportions in which they were entitled to\r\ninherit his property, that being also according to their degrees of\r\nkinship and the degrees in which they were really sufferers. This\r\ngave every clan and every clansman, in addition to their moral\r\ninterest, a direct monetary interest in the prevention and\r\nsuppression of crime. Hence the whole public feeling of the country\r\nwas entirely in support of the law, the honor and interest of\r\ncommunity and individual being involved in its maintenance. The\r\ninjured person or _fine_, if unable to recover the fine, might, in\r\ncapital cases, seize and enslave, or even kill, the convict. Probably\r\nrestrained by the fact that, there being no officers of criminal law,\r\nthey had to inflict punishment themselves, they sometimes imprisoned\r\na convict in a small island, or sent him adrift on the sea in a\r\n_currach_ or boat of hide. Law supported by public opinion, powerful\r\nbecause so inspired, powerful because unanimous, was difficult to\r\nevade or resist. It so strongly armed an injured person, and so\r\nutterly paralyzed a criminal, that escape from justice was hardly\r\npossible. The only way in which it was possible was by flight,\r\nleaving all one's property behind, and sinking into slavery in a\r\nstrange place; and this in effect was a severe punishment rather than\r\nan escape.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN LAW. The Danes and other Norsemen were the buccaneers of\r\nnorthwestern Europe from the eighth to the eleventh century. They\r\nconquered and settled permanently in Neustria, from them called\r\nNormandy, and conquered and ruled for a considerable time England and\r\npart of Scotland and the Isles. In Ireland they were little more than\r\nmarauders, having permanent colonies only round the coast; always\r\nsubject, nominally at least, to the _ard-ri_ or to the local chief;\r\npaying him tribute when he was strong, raiding his territory when he\r\nwas weak, and fomenting recurrent disorder highly prejudicial to law,\r\nreligion, and civilization. They never made any pretence of extending\r\ntheir laws to Ireland, and their attempt to conquer the country was\r\nfinally frustrated at Clontarf in 1014.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Norman invaders also seized the seaports. The earlier of\r\nthem who went inland partially adopted in the second generation the\r\nGaelic language, laws, and customs; as many non-Celtic Lowlanders of\r\nScotland about the same period adopted the Gaelic language, laws, and\r\ncustoms of the Highlanders. Hence they did not make much impression\r\non the Gaelic system, beyond the disintegrating effect of their\r\nimperfect adoption of it.\r\n\r\nInto the eastern parts of Ireland, however, a fresh stream of English\r\nadventurers continued to flow, as aggressive and covetous as their\r\nmeans and prudence permitted; calling so much of the country as they\r\nwere able to wrench from the Irish \"the English Pale\", which\r\nfluctuated in extent with their fortunes; and, when compelled to pay\r\ntribute to Irish chiefs, calling it \"black rent\", to indicate how\r\nthey regarded it. Their greatest difficulty was to counteract the\r\ntendency of the earlier colonists to become Hibernicized--a most\r\nunwilling tribute to the superiority of the Irish race. They, and\r\nstill more those in England who supported them, knew nothing of the\r\nIrish language, laws, and institutions but that they should all be\r\nimpartially hated, uprooted, and supplanted by English people and\r\neverything English as soon as means enabled this to be done. This was\r\nthe amiable purpose of the pompously-named \"Statute of Kilkenny\",\r\npassed by about a score of these colonists in 1367. Presuming to\r\nspeak in the name of Ireland, the statute prohibited the English\r\ncolonists from becoming Irish in the numerous ways they were\r\naccustomed to do, and excluded all Irish priests from preferment in\r\nthe Church, partly because their superior virtue would by contrast\r\namount to a censure. The purpose was not completely successful even\r\nwithin the Pale. Outside that precinct, the mass of the Irish were\r\nwholly unconscious of the existence of the \"Statute of Kilkenny.\" But\r\nexpressing, as the statute did correctly, the views of fresh\r\nadventurers, it became, in arrogance and in the pretension to speak\r\nfor the whole of Ireland, a model for their future legislation and\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nUnder King Henry VI. of England, Richard, Duke of York, being Lord\r\nDeputy, the Parliament of the Pale, assembled in Dublin, repudiated\r\nthe authority of the English Parliament in Ireland, established a\r\nmint, and assumed an attitude of almost complete independence. On the\r\nother hand, in 1494, under Henry VII., the Parliament of the Pale,\r\nassembled at Drogheda, passed Poyning's Act, extending all English\r\nlaws to Ireland and subjecting all laws passed in Ireland to revision\r\nby the English Council. This, extended to the whole of Ireland as\r\nEnglish power extended, remained in force until 1782. Henry VIII. was\r\nthe first English sovereign to take practical measures for the\r\npacific and diplomatic conquest of the whole of Ireland and the\r\nsubstitution of English for Irish institutions and methods. His\r\ndaughter, Queen Elizabeth, continued and completed the conquest; but\r\nit was by drenching the country in blood, by more than decimating the\r\nIrish people, and by reducing the remnant to something like the\r\ncondition of the ancient _fuidre_. Her policy prepared the ground for\r\nher successor, James I., to exterminate the Irish from large tracts,\r\nin which he planted Englishmen and Scotchmen, and to extend all\r\nEnglish laws to Ireland and abolish all other laws. James's English\r\nattorney-general in Ireland, Sir John Davies, in his work, _A\r\nDiscoverie of the True Causes, etc._, says:\r\n\r\n\"For there is no nation of people under the sunne that doth love\r\nequall and indifferent [= impartial] justice better than the Irish;\r\nor will rest better satisfied with the execution thereof, although it\r\nbee against themselves; so as they may have the protection and\r\nbenefit of the law, when uppon just cause they do desire it.\"\r\n\r\nThe ancient Irish loved their laws and took pride in obeying and\r\nenforcing them. The different attitude of the modern Irish towards\r\nforeign laws and administration is amply explained by the morally\r\nindefensible character of those laws and that administration, to be\r\nread in English statutes and ordinances and in the history of English\r\nrule in Ireland--a subject too vast and harrowing, and in every sense\r\nforeign to what has gone before, to be entered upon here. Though the\r\nParliament of 1782-1800 was little more than a Pale Parliament, in\r\nwhich the mass of the Irish people had no representation whatever,\r\none of its Acts, to its credit be it said, was an attempt to mitigate\r\nthe Penal Laws and emancipate the oppressed Gaelic and Catholic\r\npopulation of Ireland. With the partial exception of that brief\r\ninterval, law in Ireland has, during the last 360 years, meant\r\nEnglish laws specially enacted for the destruction of any Irish trade\r\nor industry that entered into competition with a corresponding\r\nEnglish trade or industry. In later times those crude barbarities\r\nhave been gradually superseded by the more defensible laws now in\r\nforce in Ireland, all of which can be studied in statutes passed by\r\nthe Parliament, since the Union with Scotland, called British.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nPending the desirable work of a more competent Brehon Law Commission\r\nand translators, the subject must be studied in the six volumes of\r\n_Ancient Laws of Ireland_, produced by the first Commission, from\r\n1865 to 1901, ignoring the long introductions and many of the notes.\r\nWhitley Stokes: Criticism of Atkinson's Glossary (London, 1903); R.\r\nDareste: Etudes d'histoire de droit (Paris, 1889); d'Arbois de\r\nJubainville and Paul Collinet: Etudes sur le droit celtique, 2 vols.\r\n(Paris, 1895); Joyce: Social History of Ancient Ireland, 2 vols.\r\n(London, 1913); Laurence Ginnell: The Brehon Laws (London, 1894).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH MUSIC\r\n\r\nBy W.H. GRATTAN FLOOD, Mus. D., M.R.I.A., K.S.G.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing so strikingly brings home the association of Ireland\r\nwith music as the fact that the harp is emblazoned on the national\r\narms. Ireland, \"the mother of sweet singers\", as Pope writes;\r\nIreland, \"where\", according to St. Columcille, \"the clerics sing like\r\nthe birds\"; Ireland can proudly point to a musical history of over\r\n2,000 years. The Milesians, the De Dananns, and other pre-Christian\r\ncolonists were musical. Hecataeus (B.C. 540-475) describes the Celts\r\nof Ireland as singing songs to the harp in praise of Apollo, and\r\nAethicus of Istria, a Christian philosopher of the early fourth\r\ncentury, describes the culture of the Irish. Certain it is that, even\r\nbefore the coming of St. Patrick, the Irish were a highly cultured\r\nnation, and the national Apostle utilized music and song in his work\r\nof conversion. In the early Lives of the Irish Saints musical\r\nreferences abound, and the Irish school of music attracted foreign\r\nscholars from the sixth to the ninth century.\r\n\r\nHymnologists are familiar with the hymns written by early Irish\r\nsaints and laics, _e.g._, St. Sechnall, St. Columcille, St. Molaise,\r\nSt. Cuchuimne, St. Columbanus, St. Ultan, St. Colman, St. Cummain,\r\nSt. Aengus, Dungal, Sedulius, Moengal, and others. Who has not heard\r\nof the great music school of San Gallen, founded by St. Gall, \"the\r\nwonder and delight of Europe,\" whither flocked German students? One\r\nof the Irish monks, Tuathal (Tutilo), composed numerous sacred\r\npieces, including the famous farced Kyrie, \"Fons bonitatis\", included\r\nin the Vatican edition of the _Kyriale_ (1906). Not alone did Irish\r\nmonks propagate sacred and secular music throughout France, Italy,\r\nSwitzerland, Austria, Germany, and the far North, but they made their\r\ninfluence felt In Lindisfarne, Malmesbury, Glastonbury, and other\r\ncities in England, as also in Scotland. St. Aldhelm, one of the\r\npupils of St. Maeldubh, tells us that at the close of the seventh\r\ncentury, \"Ireland, synonymous with learning, literally blazed like\r\nthe stars of the firmament with the glory of her scholars.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the ninth century we meet with twelve different forms of\r\ninstruments in use by the Irish, namely:--the _Cruit_ and\r\n_Clairseach_ (small and large harp); _Timpan_ (_Rotta_ or bowed\r\n_cruit_); _Buinne_ (oboe or bassoon); _Bennbuabhal_ and _Corn_\r\n(horn); _Cuisleanna_ and _Piob_ (bagpipes); _Feadan_ (flute or fife);\r\n_Guthbuinne_ (bass horn); _Stoc_ and _Sturgan_ (trumpet); _Pipai_\r\n(single and double pipes); _Craoibh cuil_ and _Crann cuil_\r\n(cymbalum); _Cnamha_ (castanet); and _Fidil_ (fiddle). The so-called\r\n\"Brian Boru's Harp\" really dates from the thirteenth century, and is\r\nnow in Trinity College, Dublin, but there are numerous sculptured\r\nharps of the ninth and tenth centuries on the crosses at Graig,\r\nUllard, Clonmacnois, Durrow, and Monasterboice.\r\n\r\nDonnchadh, an Irish bishop of the ninth century, who died as abbot of\r\nSt. Remigius, wrote a commentary on Martianus Capella, a well-known\r\nmusical text book. Towering above all his fellows, John Scotus\r\nErigena, in 867, wrote a tract _De Divisione Naturae_, in which he\r\nexpounds _organum_ or discant, nearly a hundred years before the\r\nappearance of the _Scholia Enchiriadis_ and the _Musica Enchiriadis_.\r\nHe also wrote a commentary on Martianus Capella, now in a Paris MS.\r\nof the ninth century.\r\n\r\nThe eulogy of Giraldus Cambrensis, or Gerald Barry, who came to\r\nIreland in 1183, on Irish harpers and minstrels is too well known to\r\nbe repeated, but Brompton and John of Salisbury are equally\r\nenthusiastic. Ground bass, or pedal point, and singing in parts, as\r\nwell as bands of harpers and pipers, were in vogue in Ireland before\r\nthe coming of the English. Dante, quoted by Galilei, testifies to the\r\nfact that Italy received the harp from Ireland; and, it may be added,\r\nthe Irish harp suggested the pianoforte. In the Anglo-Norman ballad,\r\n\"The Entrenchment of New Ross\"--in 1265--allusion is made to pipes\r\nand flutes, and carols and dancing. Another poem, dating from about\r\n1320, refers to Irish dances in a flattering manner.\r\n\r\nJohn Garland (1190-1264) wrote a treatise on _Organum_, and outlined\r\na scheme of dividing the interval, which developed into\r\nornamentation, passing notes, and grace notes. The Dublin _Troper_ of\r\nthe thirteenth century has a number of farced Kyries and Glorias,\r\nalso a collection of Sequences. A Dublin _Processionale_ of the\r\nfourteenth century contains the most elaborate form of the _Officium\r\nSepulchri_, with musical notation on a four-line stave--the\r\nfoundation of the Miracle Play of the Resurrection. Another Dublin\r\n_Troper_ dates from 1360 and was used in St. Patrick's Cathedral. It\r\ncontains the hymn, \"Angelus ad Virginem\", alluded to by Chaucer. The\r\nChrist Church Psaltery, about 1370, has musical notation and is\r\nexquisitely illuminated. Lionel Power, an Anglo-Irishman, wrote the\r\nfirst English treatise on music in 1395. Exactly a century later, in\r\n1495, a music school was founded in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Annals of the thirteenth to the fifteenth century have\r\nnumerous references to distinguished harpers and singers, and there\r\nare still sung many beautiful airs of this period, including \"The\r\nCoulin\" and \"Eibhlin a ruin.\" John Lawless was a famous Irish\r\norgan-builder of the second half of the fifteenth century, and his\r\nsuccessor, James Dempsey, built many fine organs between the years\r\n1530 and 1565.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many penal enactments against Irish minstrels,\r\nall the great Anglo-Irish nobles of the Pale retained an Irish harper\r\nand piper in their service. Under date of 1480, we find Chief Justice\r\nBermingham having an Irish harper to teach his family, as also \"to\r\nharp and to dance.\" A century later \"Blind Cruise, the\r\nharper\"--Richard Cruise--composed a lamentation song on the fall of\r\nthe Baron of Slane, the air of which is still popular. It is to the\r\ncredit of the Irishman, William Bathe (who subsequently became a\r\nJesuit), that he wrote the first printed English treatise on music,\r\npublished in 1584--thus ante-dating by thirteen years Morley's work.\r\nBathe wrote a second musical treatise in 1587, and he was the first\r\nto call measures by the name of bars. He also formulated methods of\r\ntransposition and sight reading that may still be studied with\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nThomas Campion, the poet and composer, was born in Dublin in 1567,\r\nbut spent nearly all his life in England. Other Irish composers, to\r\nmention only the most distinguished, were William Costello\r\n(madrigalist), Richard Gillie, Edward Shergold, and Walter Kennedy.\r\nStrange as it may seem, Queen Elizabeth retained in her service an\r\nIrish harper, Cormac MacDermot, from 1591 to 1603, and on the death\r\nof the queen he was given an annual pension of £46 10s. 10d.--nearly\r\n£500 a year of our present money.\r\n\r\nShakespeare refers to eleven Irish tunes, of which the famous\r\n\"Callino Casturame\" (_Cailin og a stuir me_) is still fresh. Irish\r\ndances were extremely popular at the English court from 1600 to 1603\r\nand were introduced into the Masks. Shakespeare's \"intrinsic friend,\"\r\nJohn Dowland of Dublin, was one of the greatest lutenists in Europe\r\nfrom 1590 to 1626. In the dedication of a song \"to my loving\r\ncountryman, Mr. John Foster the Younger, merchant of Dublin in\r\nIreland,\" Dowland sufficiently indicates his nationality, and his\r\ncompositions betray all the charm and grace of Irish melody. It is of\r\ninterest to add that the earliest printed \"Irish Dance\" is in\r\n_Parthenia Inviolata_, of which work, published in 1613-4, there is\r\nonly one copy known--now in the New York Public Library. From\r\n1600-1602, Charles O'Reilly was harpist to the court of Denmark at\r\n200 thalers a year. His successor was Donal _Dubh_ (\"the black\")\r\nO'Cahill (1602-1610), who followed Anne of Denmark to the English\r\ncourt. Walter Quin of Dublin was music master to King James's eldest\r\nson, Prince Henry, from 1608 to 1611. Other noted harpers of the\r\nfirst half of the seventeenth century are: Rory _dall_ (\"the blind\")\r\nO'Cahan; Nicholas _dall_ Pierce; Tadhg MacRory; John, Rory, and Henry\r\nScott; Owen MacKeenan; Owen MacDermot; Tadhg O'Coffey; and Father\r\nRobert Nugent, S.J. Darby Scott was harper to the Danish Court from\r\n1621 till his death, at Copenhagen, on December 19, 1634. Pierce\r\nFerriter, a \"gentleman harper\", was executed at Killarney in 1652.\r\nMyles O'Reilly and the two Connellans were famous harpers between the\r\nyears 1660-1680. Evelyn, the English diarist, in 1668, praises the\r\nexcellent performance on the harp of Sir Edward Sutton, who, in the\r\nfollowing year, was granted by King Charles II. the lands of Confey,\r\nCo. Kildare. Two beautiful harps of this period are still\r\npreserved--the Fitzgerald Harp and the Fogarty Harp.\r\n\r\nThere are many exquisite airs of the seventeenth century, some of\r\nwhich have been incorporated in Moore's _Irish Melodies_. The titles\r\nof several airs of this epoch are of historical interest, _e.g._,\r\n\"Sarsfield's Lament,\" \"Lament for Owen Roe O'Neill,\" \"MacAlistrum's\r\nMarch,\" \"Ned of the Hill,\" \"The Breach of Aughrim,\" \"Limerick's\r\nLamentation,\" \"Lilliburlero,\" \"Ballinamona,\" \"The Boyne Water,\" and\r\n\"The Wild Geese.\" Irish tunes abound in the various editions of\r\nPlayford's _Country Dances_ from 1651 to 1720.\r\n\r\nTurlogh O'Carolan (1670-1738), who has been styled \"the last of the\r\nIrish bards\", wrote and composed innumerable songs, also Planxties,\r\nPlearacas, and Lamentations. It is here merely necessary to note that\r\ntwenty-six of O'Carolan's airs are included in Moore's _Irish\r\nMelodies_, although his claim to them has only recently been proved\r\nby the present writer. Goldsmith's eulogy of O'Carolan is well known.\r\n\r\nThe Jacobite period from 1710 to 1750 considerably influenced Irish\r\nminstrelsy, and some of the most delightful airs were adapted to\r\nJacobite lyrics. \"Seaghan buidhe,\" \"An Sean duine,\" \"Lament for\r\nKilcash,\" \"Ormonde's Lament,\" \"Morin ni Chullenain,\" \"All the Way to\r\nGalway\" (the air of \"Yankee Doodle\"), \"Caitlin ni Houlihan,\" \"Balance\r\na straw\" (\"The Wearing of the Green\"), \"St. Patrick's Day,\" \"Plancam\r\nPeirbhig,\" are amongst the tunes in vogue at this period.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1685 the Hibernian Catch Club was established and still\r\nflourishes. Cecilian celebrations were held from 1727 to 1732, and a\r\nDublin Academy of Music was founded in 1728. The Charitable and\r\nMusical Society (founded in 1723) built the Fishamble Street Music\r\nHall in 1741, and assisted at the first performance of _The Messiah_,\r\nconducted by Handel himself, on 13th April, 1742. Kitty Clive, Peg\r\nWoffington, and Daniel Sullivan were noted Irish singers of this\r\nepoch, while John Clegg, Dr. Murphy, and Burke Thumoth were famous\r\ninstrumentalists. In 1741 Richard Pockrich invented the Musical\r\nGlasses, for which Gluck wrote some pieces: it was afterwards\r\nimproved by Benjamin Franklin. On the continent, Henry Madden was\r\nmusic director of the Chapel Royal at Versailles in 1744 (in\r\nsuccession to Campra), and was also canon of St. Quentin.\r\n\r\nIn 1764 the Earl of Mornington, Mus. D., was appointed first\r\nprofessor of music in Dublin University. A few years later Charles\r\nClagget invented the valve-horn. Michael Kelly of Dublin was\r\nspecially selected by Mozart to create the parts of Basilio and Don\r\nCurzio at the first performance of the opera of _Figaro_, on May 1st,\r\n1786. Kane O'Hara, Samuel Lee, Owenson, Neale, Baron Dillon, Dr.\r\nDoyle, T.A. Geary, Mahon, and the Earl of Westmeath were\r\ndistinguished musicians--while the fame of Carter, Mountain,\r\nMoorehead, and Dr. Cogan was not confined to Ireland.\r\n\r\nAmong native minstrels, Jerome Duigenan, Dominic Mongan, Denis\r\nHempson, Charles Byrne, James Duncan, Arthur Victory, and Arthur\r\nO'Neill were celebrated as harpers. The Belfast meeting of 1792\r\nrevived the vogue of the national instrument. Nor was the bagpipe\r\nneglected. Even in America, in 1778, Lord Rawdon had a band of\r\npipers, with Barney Thomson as Pipe Major. At home, Sterling,\r\nJackson, MacDonnell, Moorehead, Kennedy, and Macklin sustained the\r\nreputation of this ancient instrument.\r\n\r\nEre the close of the eighteenth century John Field of Dublin was a\r\ndistinguished pianist. He subsequently (1814) invented the nocturne,\r\ndeveloped by Chopin. Sir John Stevenson (the arranger of the _Irish\r\nMelodies_), Tom Cooke, William Southwell (inventor of the damper\r\naction for pianofortes), Henry Mountain, Andrew Ashe (flautist),\r\nBarton, Rooke, and Bunting were world-famed.\r\n\r\nAmong the Irish musicians of the last century the following names are\r\ntypical: Thomas Moore, J. A. Wade, Balle (_Bohemian Girl_), Wallace\r\n(_Maritana_), Osborne, Sir Frederick Ouseley, Scotson Clarke, Howard\r\nGlover, Horncastle, J. W. Glover, Sir Robert Stewart, Augusta Holmes,\r\nR. M. Levey, Joseph Robinson, Forde, Lover, Kearns, Allen, Barker,\r\nTorrance, Molloy, Guernsey, Gilmore, Thunder, Harvey, Goodman, Sir\r\nArthur Sullivan (_Pinafore, Mikado_), Miss Davis, Halliday (inventor\r\nof the Kent bugle), Latham, Duggan, Gaskin, Lacy, Pontet\r\n(Piccolomini), Hudson, Pigot, Horan, Marks, and W. C. Levey. Famous\r\nvocalists like Catherine Hayes, Mrs. Scott Fennell, Signer Foli\r\n(Foley), Barton McGuckin, Denis O'Sullivan, and William Ludwig\r\ndeserve inclusion.\r\n\r\nIn our own day, it is only necessary to mention composers like Sir\r\nCharles Villiers Stanford, Dr. C. Woods, Victor Herbert, Mrs.\r\nNeedham, Dr. Sinclair, Norman O'Neill, and Arthur O'Leary; singers\r\nlike Egan, Burke, Plunket Greene, John MacCormack, P. O'Shea, Charles\r\nManners, and Joseph O'Mara; violinists like Maud McCarthy, Emily\r\nKeady, Arthur Darley, and Patrick Delaney; organists like Dr. Charles\r\nMarchant, Brendan Rogers, Dr. Jozé, and Professor Buck; writers like\r\nMrs. Curwen, Dr. Annie Patterson, Mrs. Milligan Fox, Professor\r\nMahaffy, A.P. Graves, Dr. Collison, and G.B. Shaw; and conductors\r\nlike Hamilton Harty and James Glover.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nWalker: Irish Bards (1786); O'Curry: Lectures (1870); Hardiman: Irish\r\nMistrelsy (2 vols., 1834); The Complete Petrie Collection (3 vols.,\r\n1902-1904); Grattan Flood: History of Irish Music (3rd ed., 1913),\r\nStory of the Harp (1906), Story of the Bagpipe (1911); Mrs. Milligan\r\nFox: Annals of the Irish Harpers (1911); Mason: Song Lore of Ireland\r\n(1910); Armstrong: Musical Instruments (2 vols., 1904-1908); O'Neill:\r\nIrish Folk Music (1911), Irish Minstrels and Musicians (1913).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH METAL WORK\r\n\r\nBy DIARMID GOFFEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times in the history of western Europe Ireland has\r\nbeen renowned for her work in metal. The first metal used was copper,\r\nand copper weapons are found in Ireland dating from 2,000 B.C., or\r\neven earlier, the beautiful designs of which show that the early\r\ninhabitants of the country were skilled workers in metal. Fields of\r\ncopper exist all along the southern seaboard of Ireland. Numbers of\r\nflat copper celts, or axes, have been found modelled on the still\r\nearlier stone implements. By degrees the influence of the early stone\r\naxe disappears and axes of a true metal type are developed. Primitive\r\ncopper knives and awls are also abundant. The fineness of the early\r\nIrish copper work is seen at its best in the numerous copper halberd\r\nblades found in Ireland. These blades, varying from nine to sixteen\r\ninches in length, were fastened at right angles by rivets into wooden\r\nshafts. The blades show a slight sickle-like curve and are of the\r\nhighest workmanship. Halberds somewhat similar in type have been\r\nfound in Spain, North Germany, and Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 2000 and 1800 B.C. the primitive metalworkers\r\ndiscovered that bronze, a mixture of tin and copper, was a more\r\nsuitable metal than pure copper for the manufacture of weapons; and\r\nthe first period of the bronze age may be dated from 1800 to 1500\r\nB.C. The bronze celts at first differed little from those made of\r\ncopper, but gradually the type developed from the plain wedge-shaped\r\ncelt to the beautiful socketed celt, which appears on the scene in\r\nthe last, or fifth, division of the bronze age (900-350 B.C.). It was\r\nduring the age of bronze that spears came into general use, as did\r\nthe sword and rapier. The early spear-heads were simply knife-shaped\r\nbronze weapons riveted to the ends of shafts, but by degrees the\r\ngraceful socketed spear-heads of the late bronze age were developed.\r\n\r\nStone moulds for casting the early forms of weapons have been found,\r\nbut, as the art of metalworking became perfected, the use of sand\r\nmoulds was discovered, with the result that there are no extant\r\nexamples of moulds for casting the more developed forms of weapons.\r\nThe bronze weapons--celts, swords, and spear-heads--are often highly\r\ndecorated. In these decorations can be traced the connection between\r\nthe early Irish civilization and that of the eastern Mediterranean.\r\nThe bronze age civilization in Europe spread westward from the\r\neastern Mediterranean either by the southern route of Italy, Spain,\r\nFrance, and thence to Ireland, or, as seems more probable, up the\r\nriver Danube, then down the Elbe, and so to Scandinavia, whence\r\ntraders by the north of Scotland introduced the motives and patterns\r\nof the Aegean into Ireland. Whichever way the eastern civilization\r\npenetrated into Ireland, it left England practically untouched in her\r\nprimitive barbarity.\r\n\r\nOf gold work, for which Ireland is especially famous, the principal\r\nfeature in the bronze age was the lunula, a crescent-shaped flat gold\r\nornament generally decorated at the ends of the crescent. These\r\nlunulae are found in profusion all over Ireland. A few have been\r\nfound in Cornwall and Brittany, and a few in Scotland and Denmark.\r\nOne has been found in Luxemburg and one in Hanover.\r\n\r\nGold collars are numerous in Ireland and also date from the bronze\r\nage. The earliest form of collar is the \"torc\" of twisted gold.\r\nAnother type, later in date than the torc, is the gold ring-shaped\r\ncollar. Two splendid examples of this latter type were found at\r\nClonmacnois, the decoration of which, in _La Tène_, or trumpet,\r\npattern, shows the connection between the Irish and continental\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nA find of prehistoric gold ornaments in county Clare should be\r\nmentioned. An immense number was there discovered in 1854 hidden\r\ntogether in a cist, the value of the whole being estimated at over\r\n£3,000.\r\n\r\nAfter the bronze age comes the iron age. The introduction of iron\r\nwrought a great change in metalworking, but, as iron is a metal very\r\nsubject to oxidization, comparatively few early iron remains are\r\nfound. There are some swords of an early pattern in the National\r\nMuseum at Dublin.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the pre-Christian metalwork of Ireland is well\r\nworthy of attention, but it is to the early Christian metalworkers\r\nthat Ireland owes her pre-eminent fame in this field. In early\r\nChristian Ireland metalworking was brought to a pitch rarely equalled\r\nand never excelled. The remains found, such as the Tara Brooch, the\r\nCross of Cong, and the Ardagh Chalice, are among the most beautiful\r\nmetalwork in the world. The wonderful interlaced patterns, which are\r\ntypically Celtic, bewildering in their intricacy, and fascinating in\r\nthe freedom and boldness of their execution, lend themselves readily\r\nto metal work.\r\n\r\nThe connecting link between the metalwork of the late pagan period\r\nand that of early Christian times is chiefly exemplified by the\r\npenannular brooches, of which great numbers have been found in\r\nIreland. Examples of this characteristically Celtic ornament may be\r\nseen in all Celtic countries.\r\n\r\nIn its earliest form this brooch is simply a ring, with a gap in it,\r\nto which a pin is loosely attached by a smaller ring. Gradually the\r\nopen ends of the ring, which need some enlargement in order to\r\nprevent the pin slipping off, became larger and ornamented. In time\r\nthese became regular trumpet-shaped ends, generally ornamented with\r\ncharacteristic \"trumpet\" patterns. The next stage was to close the\r\ngap, leaving a ring with a crescent-shaped disc at one side. Space\r\ndoes not permit of the description of the numerous brooches found. It\r\nwill be sufficient to describe the Tara Brooch, which is the crowning\r\nglory not only of the Irish but of any metalworker's art.\r\n\r\nThe Tara Brooch, whose only connection with Tara is its name, was\r\nfound near Drogheda; it is about seven inches in diameter and the pin\r\nabout fifteen inches long. It is made of bronze covered with the most\r\nelaborate interlaced ornament in gold. The fineness of the interlaced\r\nwork may be compared with, and is quite equal to, that of the best\r\nilluminated manuscripts; the freedom of its execution is amazing.\r\nBesides panels of ribbon ornament, which include spirals, plaited\r\nwork, human heads, and animal forms, the front of the brooch is\r\ndecorated with enamel and settings of amber and colored glass. The\r\nback of the brooch is, as is often the case in Irish work, decorated\r\nin a bolder manner than the front, and the \"trumpet\" pattern is there\r\nvery marked. The head of the pin is also elaborately decorated. The\r\nminute and intricate style of the work is strikingly shown by the\r\nfact that, even after prolonged study, some patterns escaped notice\r\nand have only lately been discovered. Further, each of the gold lines\r\nis made of tiny gold balls, so small as only to be seen by means of a\r\nmagnifying glass.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of Christianity, the attention of artificers\r\nwas turned to the manufacture of church vessels and shrines. Of these\r\nperhaps the most beautiful are the Ardagh Chalice, the Cross of Cong,\r\nand the Shrine of St. Patrick's Bell, though great numbers of other\r\nsacred ornaments, such as the Shrine of St. Lactan's Arm and the\r\nnumerous bell shrines, are also fine examples of the work of an\r\nunsurpassed school of metalworkers.\r\n\r\nThe date of the Tara Brooch is not easy to determine, but it may\r\nprobably be placed in the eighth century of our era. The Ardagh\r\nChalice belongs probably to about the same date. It was found in a\r\nrath at Ardagh, county Limerick, in 1868. It measures 7 inches in\r\nheight and 9-1/2 in diameter. Around the cup is a band of fine\r\nfiligree interlaced ornament in the form of panels divided by half\r\nbeads of enamel. Below this are the names of the twelve Apostles in\r\nfaint Celtic lettering. The two handles are beautifully decorated\r\nwith panels of interwoven ornament, and on the sides are two circular\r\ndiscs divided into ornamented panels. The under side of the foot of\r\nthe Chalice is also very beautifully decorated.\r\n\r\nThe shrines of the bells of the Irish saints are interesting examples\r\nof Irish metal work. As is fitting, the finest of these is the Shrine\r\nof St. Patrick's Bell. This was made by order of King Domnall\r\nO'Lachlainn between the years 1091 and 1105 to contain St. Patrick's\r\nBell, a square iron bell made of two plates of sheet iron riveted\r\ntogether. The shrine is made of bronze plates, to which gold filigree\r\nwork and stones are riveted. The top of the shrine, curved to receive\r\nthe handle of the bell, is of silver elaborately decorated. The back\r\nis overlaid with a plate of silver cut in cruciform pattern. Around\r\nthe margin of the back is engraved the following inscription in\r\nIrish: \"A prayer for Domnall Ua Lachlainn, by whom this bell [shrine]\r\nwas made, and for Domnall, successor of Patrick, by whom it was made,\r\nand for Cathalan Ua Maelchallann, the keeper of the bell, and for\r\nCudulig Ua Inmainen with his sons, who fashioned it.\" The whole is\r\nexecuted in a very fine manner and is the most beautiful object of\r\nits kind in existence. Another beautiful shrine, known as the Cross\r\nof Cong, made to enshrine a piece of the true cross presented by the\r\npope in 1123, was made for King Turlogh O'Conor at about that date.\r\nIt is 2 feet 6 inches high and 1 foot 6-3/4 inches wide. It is made\r\nof oak cased with copper and enriched with ornaments of gilded\r\nbronze. The ornamentation is of the typical Irish type, as on the\r\nArdagh Chalice and the Shrine of St. Patrick's Bell. A quartz crystal\r\nset in the centre of the front of the cross probably held the relic.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the succession of beautiful work executed from the\r\neighth to the twelfth century, that there must have existed in\r\nIreland during that period a school of workers in metal such as has\r\nseldom been equalled by any individual worker or guild before or\r\nsince, and never excelled. The examples described are only the more\r\nfamous of the remains of early Irish Christian art in metal, but they\r\nare surrounded by numerous examples of pins, brooches, and shrines,\r\neach worthy to rank with the finest productions of the metalworker.\r\nThe Shrine of St. Moedoc (date uncertain) ought perhaps to be\r\nmentioned. On it are found several figures, including three nuns, men\r\nwith books, sceptres, and swords, and a lifelike figure of a harper.\r\n\r\nBesides articles of ornament, articles of use, such as bits for\r\nhorses and household utensils, have been found, which show that the\r\nIrish smiths were as well able to produce articles for every-day use\r\nas the artificers were to create works of art in metal.\r\n\r\nWith the landing of the English in 1169 the arts and sciences in\r\nIreland declined. Indeed, from that time on and for long afterwards,\r\nalmost the only metalworkers needed were makers of arms and weapons\r\nof offense and defense.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nBritish Museum, Bronze Age Guide; Coffey: Bronze Age in Ireland;\r\nAllen: Celtic Art; Abercrombie: Bronze Age Pottery; Wilde: Catalogue\r\nof the Royal Irish Academy's Collection; Allen: Christian Symbolism;\r\nStokes: Christian Art in Ireland; Petrie: Ecclesiastical Architecture\r\nin Ireland; Coffey: Guide to the Celtic Antiquities of the Christian\r\nPeriod perserved in the National Museum, Dublin; Kane: Industrial\r\nResources of Ireland; O'Curry: Manners and Customs of the Ancient\r\nIrish; Coffey: New Grange and other incised Tumuli in Ireland;\r\nDechelette: Manuel d'Archéologie pré-historique; Ridgeway: Origin of\r\nCurrency and Weight Standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH MANUSCRIPTS\r\n\r\nBy LOUIS ELY O'CARROLL, B.A., B.L.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the dark ages of Europe, whilst new civilizations were in the\r\nmaking and all was unrest, art and religion, like the lamp of the\r\nsanctuary, burned brightly and steadily in Ireland, and their rays\r\npenetrated the outer gloom. Scattered through the libraries of Europe\r\nare the priceless manuscripts limned by Irish scribes. The earliest\r\nmissionaries to the continent, disciples of St. Columbanus and St.\r\nGall, doubtless brought with them into exile beautiful books which\r\nthey or their brothers of the parent monastery had wrought in a labor\r\nof love; or mayhap many a monk crossed the seas bearing the treasured\r\nvolumes into hiding from the spoiling hands of the Dane. Yet,\r\nfortunately, in the island home where their beauty was born the most\r\nsuperb volumes still remain.\r\n\r\nFrom almost prehistoric times the Irish were skilled artificers in\r\ngold and bronze, and, at the advent of Christianity, had already\r\nevolved and perfected that unique system of geometrical ornament\r\nwhich is known as Celtic design. The original and essential features\r\nof this system consisted in the use of spirals and interlacing\r\nstrapwork, but later on this type was developed by transforming the\r\ngeometrical fret into a scheme of imaginary or nondescript animals,\r\nportions of which, such as the tails and ears, were prolonged and\r\nwoven in exquisite fancy through the border. The artistic features of\r\nCeltic book decoration consist chiefly of initial letters of this\r\nnature embellished with color. Amongst the ancient Irish there was a\r\nkeen knowledge of color and an exceptional appreciation of color\r\nvalues. Thus it was that in the early centuries of Christian Ireland\r\nthe learned monks, transcribing the Gospels and longing to make the\r\nbook beautiful, were able to bring to their task an artistic skill\r\nwhich was hereditary and almost instinctive. The colors which they\r\nused were mostly derived from mineral substances and the black was\r\ncarbon, made, it is conjectured, from charred fish-bones; but with\r\nthem was combined some gummy material which made them cling softly to\r\nthe vellum and has held for us their lustre for more than a thousand\r\nyears. It is noteworthy that neither gold nor silver was used for\r\nbook decoration, and this would appear to be a deliberate avoidance\r\nof the glitter and glare which distinguish eastern art.\r\n\r\n_The Book of Durrow _(in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin) is\r\nthe oldest specimen of Celtic illumination and, if not the work of\r\nSt. Columcille, is certainly of as early a date. Each of the Gospels\r\nopens with a beautiful initial succeeded by letters of gradually\r\ndiminishing size, and there are full page decorations embodying such\r\nsubjects as the symbols of the Evangelists. The colors are rich and\r\nvivid and all the designs are of the purest and most Celtic\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n_The Gospels of MacRegol _(now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford) is\r\nthe work of an Abbot of Birr who died A.D. 820. It is a volume of\r\nunusually large size, copiously ornamented with masterly designs and\r\ncontaining illuminated portraits of Saints Mark, Luke, and John. The\r\nfirst part of the book with the portrait of St. Matthew is missing.\r\n_The Book of Kells _(in the Library of T.C.D.) is the all-surpassing\r\nmasterpiece of Celtic illuminative art and is acknowledged to be the\r\nmost beautiful book in the world. This copy of the four Gospels was\r\nlong deemed to have been made by the saintly hands of Columcille,\r\nthough it probably belongs to the eighth century. Into its pages are\r\nwoven such a wealth of ornament, such an ecstasy of art, and such a\r\nmiracle of design that the book is today not only one of Ireland's\r\ngreatest glories but one of the world's wonders. After twelve\r\ncenturies the ink is as black and lustrous and the colors are as\r\nfresh and soft as though but the work of yesterday. The whole range\r\nof colors is there--green, blue, crimson, scarlet, yellow, purple,\r\nviolet--and the same color is at times varied in tone and depth and\r\nshade, thereby achieving a more exquisite combination and effect. In\r\naddition to the numerous decorative pages and marvellous initials,\r\nthere are portraits of the Evangelists and full-page miniatures of\r\nthe Temptation of Christ, His Seizure by the Jews, and the Madonna\r\nand Child surrounded by Angels with censers. Exceptionally beautiful\r\nare these angels and other angelic figures throughout the book, their\r\nwings shining with glowing colors amid woven patterns of graceful\r\ndesign. The portraits and miniatures and the numerous faces centred\r\nin initial letters are not to be adjudged by the standard of\r\nanatomical drawing and delineation of the human figure, but rather by\r\ntheir effect as part of a scheme of ornamentation; for the Celtic\r\nilluminator was imaginative rather than realistic, and aimed\r\naltogether at achieving beauty by means of color and design. The Book\r\nof Kells is the Mecca of the illuminative artist, but it is the\r\ndespair of the copyist. The patience and skill of the olden scribe\r\nhave baffled the imitator; for, on an examination with a magnifying\r\nglass, it has been found that, in a space of a quarter of an inch,\r\nthere are no fewer than a hundred and fifty-eight interlacements of a\r\nribbon pattern of white lines edged by black ones on a black ground.\r\nSurely this is the manuscript which was shown to Giraldus Cambrensis\r\ntowards the close of the twelfth century and of whose illuminations\r\nhe speaks with glowing enthusiasm; \"they were,\" he says, \"supposed to\r\nhave been produced by the direction of an angel at the prayer of St.\r\nBrigid.\"\r\n\r\n_The Gospels of MacDurnan _(now in the Archbishop's Library at\r\nLambeth) is a small and beautiful volume which was executed by an\r\nabbot of Armagh who died in the year 891. A full-page picture of the\r\nEvangelist precedes each Gospel, and a composite border frames each\r\nminiature in a bewildering pattern of intertwining strapwork and\r\nwonderful designs of imaginary beasts. Ornamental capitals and rich\r\nborders give a special beauty to the initial pages of the Gospels.\r\n\r\n_The Book of Armagh _(in the Library of T.C.D.) was carefully guarded\r\nand specially venerated through the ages in the erroneous belief that\r\nit was in part the handiwork of St. Patrick. It was written about the\r\nyear 800, and would appear to have been copied from documents\r\nactually written by the patron saint of Ireland. The book is\r\nexceptionally interesting by reason of the fact that it contains St.\r\nPatrick's Confession, that beautiful story of how he found his\r\nmission, how the captive grew to love his captors, and how, after his\r\nescape, he came back to them bearing the lamp of Holy Faith. Although\r\nthe ornamentation of the manuscript is infrequent, there are\r\noccasional beautiful examples which compare in richness with those in\r\nthe Book of Kells.\r\n\r\n_The Liber Hymnorum _(in the Franciscan Monastery, Dublin) contains a\r\nnumber of hymns associated with the names of Irish saints. The\r\nornamentation consists of colored initials, designed with a striking\r\nuse of fanciful animal figures interlaced and twined with delightful\r\nfreedom around the main structural body.\r\n\r\nThe _Garland of Howth_ and the _Stowe Missal_ (both in Trinity\r\nCollege Library) belong to the eighth century and are beautiful\r\nexamples of early illuminative art. The former, which is very\r\nincomplete, has only two ornamental pages left, each containing\r\nfigure-representations inserted in the decorative work.\r\n\r\nThe _Gospels of St. Chad_ (in the Cathedral Library at Lichfield) and\r\nthe _Gospels of Lindisfarne_, which are \"the glory of the British\r\nMuseum\", form striking examples of the influence of Celtic art. St.\r\nChad was educated in Ireland in the school of St. Finian, where he\r\nacquired his training in book decoration. The Gospels of Lindisfarne\r\nwere produced by the monks of Iona, where St. Columcille founded his\r\ngreat school of religion, art, and learning. This latter manuscript\r\nis second only to the Book of Kells in its glory of illuminative\r\ndesign, and, from its distinctive scheme of colors, the tones of\r\nwhich are light and bright and gay, it forms a contrast to the\r\nquieter shades and the solemn dignity of the more famous volume.\r\n\r\n_The Book of the Dun Cow, The Book of Leinster_, and the other great\r\nmanuscripts of the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries are\r\ninteresting as literature rather than as art, for they tell the\r\nhistory of ancient Erin and have garnered her olden legends and\r\nromantic tales. It is only the Gospels and other manuscripts of\r\nreligious subjects that are illuminated. In the apparel of the\r\nancient Irish, the number of colors marked the social rank: the king\r\nmight wear seven colors, poets and learned men six; five colors were\r\npermitted in the clothes of chieftains, and thus grading down to the\r\nservant, who might wear but one. All this the scribe knew well. We\r\ncan picture the humble servant of God, clad in a coarse robe of a\r\nsingle color, deep in his chosen labor of recording the life and\r\nteachings of his Master, and striving to endow this record with the\r\nglory of the seven colors which were rightly due to a King alone. As\r\nwe gaze on his work today its beauty is instinct with life, and the\r\npatient love that gave it birth seems to cling to it still. The white\r\nmagic of the artist's holy hands has bridged the span of a thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nO'Curry: Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Ancient Irish\r\nHistory (Dublin, 1861); Brunn: An Enquiry into the Art of the\r\nIlluminated Manuscripts of the Middle Ages, Part I, Celtic\r\nIlluminated Manuscripts (Edinburgh, 1897); Robinson: Celtic\r\nIlluminative Art in the Gospels of Durrow, Lindisfarne, and Kells\r\n(Dublin, 1908); Westwood: The Book of Kells, a lecture given in\r\nOxford, November, 1886 (Dublin, 1887); Gougaud: Répertoire des\r\nfac-similés des manuscripts irlandais (Paris, 1913).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUINS OF IRELAND\r\n\r\nBy FRANCIS JOSEPH BIGGER, M.R.I.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Ireland are her proudest monuments. They stand as a\r\nlasting revelation to all mankind--a distinct and definite\r\nproclamation that the Irish people, century after century, were able\r\nto raise and adorn some of the finest buildings in stone that western\r\ncivilization has seen or known. It is recognized the world over that\r\nIrish art has a beauty and distinction all its own, in its own Irish\r\nsetting unrivalled, throned in its own land, in its own natural\r\nsurroundings. The shrines and gospels, the reliquaries and missals,\r\nthe crosses and bells that are still existent, many in Ireland,\r\nothers in every country in the world, attest beyond any dispute that\r\nIrish art-workers held a preëminent place in the early middle ages,\r\nand that works of Irish art are still treasured as unique in their\r\nday and time. No country has been plundered and desolated as Ireland\r\nhas been. Dane, Norman, English--each in turn swept across the fair\r\nface of Ireland, carrying destruction in their train, yet withal\r\nIreland has her art treasures and her ruins that bear favorable\r\ncomparison with those of other civilizations.\r\n\r\nIn Dublin and in many private Irish collections can be found\r\nhand-written books of parchment, illuminated with glowing colors that\r\ntime has scarce affected or the years caused to fade. On one page\r\nalone of the Book of Kells, ornament and writing can be seen penned\r\nand painted in lines too numerous even to count. They are there by\r\nthe thousand: a magnifying glass is required to reveal even a\r\nfragment of them. Ireland produced these in endless number--every\r\ngreat library or collection in Europe possesses one or more examples.\r\n\r\nAs with books, so with reliquaries, crosses, and bells. When the\r\nIsland of Saints and Scholars could produce books, it could make\r\nshrines and everything necessary to stimulate and hand down the piety\r\nand the patient skill of a people steeped in art-craft and religious\r\nfeeling. What they could do on parchment--like the Books of Kells and\r\nDurrow--what they could produce in bronze and precious metals--like\r\nthe Cross of Cong, the Shrine of Saint Patrick's Bell, the Tara\r\nBrooch, and the Chalice of Ardagh--not to write of the numberless\r\nbronze and gold articles of an age centuries long preceding their\r\nproduction--they could certainly vie with in stone.\r\n\r\nOf this earlier work a word must go down. In Ireland still at the\r\npresent day, after all the years of plunder she has undergone, more\r\nancient gold art-treasures remain than in any other country, museum,\r\nor collection, most of them pre-Christian, and what the other\r\ncountries do possess are largely Irish or of Celtic origin. We must\r\nhave this borne into the minds of every one of Irish birth or origin,\r\nthat this great treasure was battered into shape by Irish hands on\r\nIrish anvils, designed in Irish studios, ornamented with Irish skill\r\nfor Irish use.\r\n\r\nWith such workmen, having such instincts and training, what of the\r\nhousing and surroundings to contain them and give them a fit and\r\nsuitable setting? The earliest stone structures in Ireland still\r\nremaining are the great stone cashels or circular walls enclosing\r\nlarge spaces--walls of great thickness, unmortared, in which there\r\nare vast quantities of masonry. Around their summits a chariot might\r\nbe driven, inside their spaces horse races might be run. As a few\r\nexamples, there are Staigue, in Kerry; Dun Angus, in Aran, off\r\nGalway; Aileach, above the walls of Derry. Of the earliest churches,\r\ncyclopean in construction and primitive in character, built of stone,\r\nwith thick sloping walls from foundation to ridge, Gallerus still\r\nremains, and the Skelligs, those wondrous sea-girt rocks, preserve\r\nboth church and cell almost perfect. There are many other examples,\r\nsome of a later date, such as Temple Cronan and Maghera and Banagher\r\nin Derry, St. Finan's oratory in county Cork, St. Fechin's at Fore,\r\nand St. Molaise's at Devenish.\r\n\r\nFrom the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries, there are innumerable\r\nexamples of oratories, some with stone roofs, others with roofs not\r\nso permanent, but all having the common features of an altar window\r\nfacing the east, through which the sun fell at the beginning of the\r\nday to tell the early missioner that his hour of devotion had\r\narrived, and a west door, through which the rays of the declining sun\r\nfell across the altar steps, speaking of a day that was closing. A\r\nsouth window was added close to the east end, and it, too, was a\r\nsun-dial; it told the hour of angelus, the mid-day, when the bell was\r\nrung and a calm reverence fell on all within its hearing. Such\r\nchurches can still be seen at Aran and Inismurray, on the islands of\r\nLough Derg, Lough Ri, and in many other places.\r\n\r\nA few years later these oratories were too small for the growing\r\nfaith, and larger churches were built, some using the older structure\r\nas chancels. Where the west door was built a circular arch was made\r\nand the new and old united. This can well be seen at Inis-na-ghoill\r\nin Lough Corrib, on the Aran Islands off Galway, at Glendalough, at\r\nInis-cleraun in Lough Ri, at Clonmacnois, at Iniscaltra, and on many\r\nanother island and promontory of the south and west.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, and after, we find the most elaborate carvings on\r\ndoor and arch and window, equal in skill to what is found in book or\r\nmetal work.\r\n\r\nIt must have been at this time that the Galls, or strangers, first\r\ninvaded Ireland, bearing havoc in their train, for then it was that\r\nthe _cloicteach_, or Round Towers, were built. It is now admitted by\r\nall Irish authorities of any repute, and that beyond dispute, that\r\nthe Round Towers, the glory of Ireland, were built by Irish people as\r\nChristian monuments from which the bells might be rung, and as places\r\nof strength for the preservation of the valued articles used in\r\nChristian worship; here they might be safely stored. They were also\r\nused for the preservation of life in case of sudden attack and\r\nonslaught by unexpected enemies. All the towers are on ecclesiastical\r\nsites, many are incorporated in church buildings, such as those of\r\nGlendalough in Wicklow and Clonmacnois on the Shannon, The records of\r\nthe construction of some of them in the tenth and eleventh centuries\r\nare still extant, and this is conclusive. There are today about\r\nseventy Round Towers in Ireland, and many have been destroyed.\r\n\r\n      The pillar towers of Ireland, how wondrously they stand\r\n      By the lakes and rushing rivers through the valleys of our land;\r\n      In mystic file, through the isle, they lift their heads sublime,\r\n      These gray old pillar temples--these conquerors of time.\r\n\r\n      Here was placed the holy chalice that held the sacred wine,\r\n      And the gold cross from the altar, and the relics from the shrine,\r\n      And the mitre shining brighter with its diamonds than the east,\r\n      And the crozier of the pontiff, and the vestments of the priest.\r\n\r\n                                                _D.F. MacCarthy_.\r\n\r\nThis was the time when the High Crosses of Ireland were carved and\r\nset up. They vie with the Round Towers in interest and in the display\r\nof skill. What the towers have in perfection, masonry and\r\nconstruction, the crosses have in artistic carving and symbolic\r\ndesign. No two crosses are alike; they are as varied as the clouds in\r\nan Irish sky or the pebbles on the beach or the flowers in a garden.\r\nThey were carved in reverence by those who knew and esteemed their\r\nart, and lavished all their skill and knowledge on what they most\r\nvalued and treasured. They were not set up as grave-marks\r\nmerely--theirs was a higher and loftier mission. They were raised in\r\nplaces where some great event or period was to be commemorated--they\r\nwere erected where some early disciple of the Cross could stand\r\nbeside one of them and from any panel could tell the foundation of\r\nthe Faith, for there in stone was story after story, from the Old\r\nTestament and the New, that gave him his text, and so, as at the\r\nCross of the Scriptures at Clonmacnois, a missioner could preach on\r\nevery recurring holy day from Christmas to Christmas, with ever his\r\ntext in stone before him. Many a broken and mutilated cross has been\r\nset up in Ireland in recent years, proving that the heart of the\r\nGael, no matter how rent and broken, is still inclined to bind up the\r\nbroken wounds of her past glories.\r\n\r\nWith the religious orders there came to Ireland a widespread desire\r\nto add something to the older sanctuaries of the Gael, to widen their\r\nborders and strengthen their cords, and so the abbeys were founded.\r\nHere and there we find them still--by winding rivers, on rich\r\nmeadows, in glens and glades, by the sea margin, or on the slopes of\r\nthe rugged mountain. Their crumbling walls and broken windows can\r\nstill be traced, their towers are still to be seen over tree tops and\r\nin the centre of many a slumbering town. By the shores of Donegal Bay\r\nthe old Franciscan house, where the Four Masters compiled what is\r\nperhaps the most remarkable record possessed by any nation, is still\r\nclothed in ivy. At Kilconnell, in Galway, their old place is almost\r\nas they left it, but roofless, with the tears of the friars upon the\r\naltar steps. Clare Galway has a tower worth travelling half a\r\ncontinent to see. By the Boniet River, at Drumahaire, on the banks of\r\nLough Gill, are the mason marks of the cloister builders, and the\r\nfigure of St. Francis talking to the birds is still there. The abbey\r\nis roofless and empty, and so the birds of the air are his constant\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nSpace forbids, or endless abbeys might be described. The Black Abbey\r\nat Kilkenny, with its long row of Butler effigies, or the Cathedral\r\nof Saint Canice, still perfect, with its soaring round tower beside\r\nit, or the mystical seven light window of the Franciscan friary by\r\nthe Nore, with the old mill-weirs running free to this day. How long\r\ncould we ponder by the east window of Kilcooley, with tracery like a\r\nspider's web, and listen to the mystical bells, or gaze at the\r\nbeautiful oriel at Feenagh, or stand at Jerpoint, with its spacious\r\ncloisters and stone-groined choir, with Saint Christopher in Irish\r\nmarble beside us.\r\n\r\nCashel, one of the wonders of the world, grows up suddenly into sight\r\non a high rock rising from level land crowned with buildings. A great\r\nabbey dominates; beside it clings that carved gem of a stone-roofed\r\nchurch, Cormac's Chapel. Round Tower and Cross are there, and many a\r\nsculptured tomb.\r\n\r\nNot far from Cashel is the Abbey of Holy Cross, with its lovely\r\nmitred windows, shadowed in the river passing at its feet. The\r\ncircular pillars and arches of Boyle Abbey are splendidly\r\nproportioned, whilst the cloisters of Sligo display in their long,\r\nshadowy recesses and ornamented pillars great dignity and beauty. The\r\nwindows and monuments of Ennis Friary, founded by the O'Briens, are\r\nof unusual interest, the carving of figure-subjects being equal to\r\nthe best of their age.\r\n\r\nWe have Thomastown and Callan, Dunbrody and Tintern, all having an\r\nindividual charm and interest that not only dim the eye and make the\r\nblood course freely in every one of Irish stock when he looks upon\r\nwhat is and thinks of what was, but even in the coldest light give\r\nfood for thought to every one desirous of knowing something of the\r\ngrowth and civilization of a great people.\r\n\r\nOf the many castles and stout Irish strongholds it is hard to write\r\nin such a short paper as this. Those on the Boyne, such as Trim, for\r\nstrong building and extent, excel in many ways. Carlingford,\r\nCarrickfergus, and Dunluce have by their size and picturesque\r\nsituations ever appealed to visitors. They are each built on rocks\r\njutting into the sea, Dunluce on a great perpendicular height, the\r\nAtlantic dashing below. Dunamace, near Maryborough, in the O'More\r\ncountry, appears like Cashel, but is entirely military. The famed\r\nwalled cities of Kells, in Kilkenny, and Fore, in Westmeath, are\r\nremarkable. Each has an abbey, many towers, gates, and stout\r\nbastions. The great keeps of the midland lords, the towers of\r\nGranuaile on the west coast, and the traders' towers on the east\r\ncoast, especially those of Down, afford ample material for a study of\r\nthe early colonizing efforts of different invaders, as well as\r\nproviding incidents of heroism and romance. These square battlemented\r\ntowers can be seen here and there in every district.\r\n\r\nEvery portion of Ireland has its ruins. Earthworks, stone forts,\r\nprehistoric monuments, circular stone huts, early churches, abbeys,\r\ncrosses, round towers, castles of every size and shape are to be\r\nfound in every county, some one in every parish, all over Ireland. It\r\nis almost invidious to name any in particular where the number is so\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nProceedings of Royal Irish Academy (Dublin); Proceedings of Society\r\nof Antiquaries (Dublin); Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Old Series\r\nand New Series, edited by F.J.

O'DONOGHUE,\r\n\r\n_Librarian, University College, Dublin_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to dispute, in view of her innumerable and\r\nexcellent artists, that there has always been in modern times an art\r\nconsciousness in Ireland, but it is impossible to assert that there\r\nhas been any artistic unity in her people. She has produced no\r\nschool, but merely a great number of brilliant painters, sculptors,\r\nand engravers, chiefly for export. With all our acknowledged artistic\r\ncapacity, we have not, except in one notable instance, produced a\r\ncumulative art effect. The history of Irish art is almost uniformly a\r\ndepressing narrative. During a comparatively brief period in the\r\neighteenth century--significantly enough, it was while the country\r\nenjoyed a short spell of national life--there was something like a\r\nnational patronage of the artist, and the result is visible in the\r\nnoble public buildings and beautiful houses of the Irish capital,\r\nwith their universally admired mantelpieces, doors, ceilings,\r\nfanlights, ironwork, and carvings. In short, while Ireland had even a\r\npartly unfettered control of her own concerns, the arts were\r\ngenerously encouraged by her government and by the wealthy\r\nindividual. When other European capitals were mere congeries of\r\nrookeries, Dublin, the centre of Irish political life, possessed\r\nsplendid streets, grandly planned. But there was little solidarity\r\namong the artistic fraternity. Various associations of artists were\r\nformed, which held together fairly well until the flight of the\r\nresident town gentry after the Union, and many admirable artists were\r\ntrained in the schools of the Royal Dublin Society, but, since the\r\nopening of the nineteenth century, there has been almost no visible\r\nart effort in Dublin. True, there have been many fine artists, who\r\nhave made a struggle to fix themselves in Dublin, but, as with the\r\nRoyal Hibernian Academy, of which the best of them were members, the\r\nstruggle has been a painful agony. Usually the artist migrated to\r\nLondon to join the large group of Irishmen working there; a few\r\nothers went to America and obtained an honored place in her art\r\nannals. Those who went to England secured in many cases the highest\r\nrewards of the profession. Several, like Barry, Hone, Barrett, and\r\nCotes, were founders or early members of the Royal Academy; one, Sir\r\nMartin Shee, became its President. Nevertheless, many distinguished\r\nartists remained in Dublin, where the arts of portrait-painting and\r\nengraving were carried to a high pitch of excellence.\r\n\r\nThis record must necessarily be of a chronological character, and can\r\nonly take note of those whose works have actual value and interest,\r\nhistorical or other. Edward Luttrell (1650-1710) did some excellent\r\nwork in crayon or pastel, while Garrett Murphy (fl. 1650-1716),\r\nStephen Slaughter (d. 1765), Francis Bindon (d. 1765), and James\r\nLatham (1696-1747), have each left us notable portraits of the great\r\nIrish personages of their day. To fellow countrymen in London,\r\nCharles Jervas (1675?-1739), Thomas Hickey (d. 1816?), and Francis\r\nCotes, R.A. (1725-1770), we owe presentments of other famous people.\r\nGeorge Barrett, R.A. (1728-1784), one of the greatest landscapists of\r\nhis time; Nathaniel Hone, R.A. (1718-1784), an eccentric but gifted\r\npainter, with an individuality displayed in all his portraits; James\r\nBarry, R.A. (1741-1806), still more eccentric, with grand conceptions\r\nimperfectly carried out in his great historical and allegorical\r\npictures:--these, with Henry Tresham, R.A. (1749?-1814), and Matthew\r\nPeters, R.A. (1742-1814), historical painters of considerable merit,\r\nupheld the Irish claim to a high place in English eighteenth century\r\nart. A little later, miniaturists such as Horace Hone, A.R.A.\r\n(1756-1825), George Chinnery (1774-1852), and Adam Buck (1759-1844),\r\nalso worked with remarkable success in London. Among resident Irish\r\nartists, the highest praise can be given to the miniature painters,\r\nJohn Comerford (1770?-1832) and Charles Robertson (1760-1821), and to\r\nthe portrait-painters, Robert Hunter (fl. 1750-1803) and (especially)\r\nHugh Douglas Hamilton (1739-1808), of whose work Ireland possesses\r\nmany distinguished examples. Some day Hamilton's pictures will appeal\r\nto a far wider public than his countrymen can provide. One must omit\r\nthe names of many clever Irish artists like the Wests, Francis and\r\nRobert, who were the most successful teachers of perhaps any time in\r\nIreland, and come at once to that branch of art in which Ireland\r\nstands second to none--mezzotint-engraving.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest engravers in this style was Edward Luttrell,\r\nalready named as a painter, but it was John Brooks (fl. 1730-1756)\r\nwho is justly considered the real founder of that remarkable group of\r\nIrish engravers whose work may be more correctly described as\r\nbelonging to a school than any other of the period. For many years in\r\nDublin, and afterwards in London, a succession of first-rate artists\r\nof Irish birth produced work which remains and always must remain one\r\nof the glories of Ireland. Limits of space allow only the bare\r\nmention of the names of James McArdell (1728?-1765), Charles Spooner\r\n(d. 1767), Thomas Beard (fl. 1728), Thomas Frye (1710-1762), Edward\r\nFisher (1722-1785?), Michael Ford (d. 1765), John Dixon (1740?-1811),\r\nRichard Purcell (fl. 1746-1766), Richard Houston (1721?-1775), John\r\nMurphy (1748?-1820), Thomas Burke (1749-1815), Charles Exshaw (fl.\r\n1747-1771), and Luke Sullivan (1705-1771)--artists of whom any\r\ncountry might be proud, and whose works have in most cases outlasted\r\nthe remembrance of the persons whose likenesses they sought to\r\nreproduce. Separate monographs might be justifiably written on most\r\nof the gifted artists here enumerated, and one can only regret not\r\nbeing able in short space to compare and estimate their various\r\nqualities. Thomas Chambers, A.R.A. (1724?-1784), William Nelson\r\nGardiner (1766-1814), James Egan (1799-1842), and William Humphreys\r\n(1794-1865) are other Irish engravers who cannot be overlooked in a\r\nsurvey of the art of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with the remarkable development of the art of\r\nengraving arose a group of Irish architects. Rather earlier in point\r\nof time was Sir Edward Lovat Pearce (d. 1733), who was one of the\r\nchief architects of the Irish Parliament House, and Thomas Burgh (d.\r\n1730), to whom we owe the Library of Trinity College, Dublin; but\r\nThomas Cooley (1740-1784), designer of the handsome Royal Exchange of\r\nthat city; Richard Castle (d. 1751), a foreigner who settled in\r\nIreland and built a number of beautiful Irish residences; Francis\r\nJohnston (1761-1829), an excellent architect whose chief claim to\r\nremembrance, however, is as founder of the Royal Hibernian Academy;\r\nand, above all, James Gandon (1743-1823), whose superb Custom House,\r\nFour Courts, and part of the Irish Parliament House will perpetuate\r\nhis name in Dublin while that city lasts--each helped to make the\r\ncapital, even in its decay, one of the most interesting in Europe.\r\nNor should we forget Thomas Ivory (d. 1786), whose Foundling Hospital\r\nis another of Dublin's many graceful edifices; nor Sir Richard\r\nMorrison (1767-1849) and his son William (1794-1838), much of whose\r\nwork remains to testify to their skill and ingenuity.\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical architecture in Ireland is indebted to Patrick Byrne\r\n(fl. 1840), James J. McCarthy (d. 1882), J.B. Keane (d. 1859), and\r\nJames Murray (1831-1863), for many well designed churches and chapels\r\nthroughout Ireland; but the great names in modern Irish architecture\r\nare those of Benjamin Woodward (1815-1861), whose premature death was\r\na serious loss to Irish art; Sir Thomas Deane (1792-1871); and his\r\nson, Sir Thomas Newenham Deane (1828-1899). The elder Deane was, with\r\nWoodward, the architect of the Oxford Museum and of the splendid\r\nEngineering Hall of Trinity College, Dublin, buildings which have\r\nelicited enthusiastic praise from John Ruskin and other eminent\r\ncritics. Deserving of respectful mention, too, to come down to our\r\nown days, are Sir Thomas Drew (1838-1910) and William H. Lynn, who is\r\nstill living.\r\n\r\nIn sculpture, again, Ireland has done memorable work. In the\r\neighteenth century she gave us admirable craftsmen like Edward Smyth\r\n(1749-1812), John Hickey (1756-1795), and Christopher Hewitson (fl.\r\n1772-1794), whose dignified monument of Bishop Baldwin is one of the\r\nmost distinguished pieces of sculpture in Trinity College, Dublin.\r\nBut it was not till the appearance of a later group of sculptors,\r\nincluding John Hogan (1800-1858), John Edward Carew (1785-1868), John\r\nHenry Foley, R.A. (1818-1874), and Patrick MacDowell, R.A.\r\n(1799-1870), that Irish sculpture obtained more than local renown.\r\nFortunately, most of the best work of Hogan and Foley remains in\r\nIreland; that of Carew and MacDowell is chiefly to be found in the\r\nHouses of Parliament and other institutions in London. The\r\nincomparable \"Goldsmith,\" \"Burke,\" \"Grattan,\" and other statues by\r\nFoley, together with an almost complete collection of casts of his\r\nother works, are in his native country. Hogan is represented in\r\nDublin by his \"Thomas Davis\" and his \"Dead Christ,\" to name but two\r\nof his principal works. The names at least of James Heffernan\r\n(1785-1847), of John Edward Jones (1806-1872), of Terence Farrell\r\n(1798-1876), of Samuel F. Lynn (1834-1876), and perhaps of\r\nChristopher Moore (1790-1863), an excellent sculptor of busts, may be\r\nset down here. Sir Thomas Farrell (1827-1900) and the living\r\nsculptors, John Hughes, Oliver Sheppard, and Albert Bruce Joy, are\r\nresponsible for some of the more admirable of the public monuments of\r\nDublin. It is much to be deplored that of the work of one of the\r\ngreatest of Dublin-born artists, Augustus Saint Gaudens, we have only\r\none example--the statue of Parnell. Ireland may surely claim him as\r\none of her most gifted sons. And perhaps a word might be said in this\r\nplace of some of the other Irishmen who made their home in America:\r\nof Hoban the architect who designed the White House at Washington,\r\nmodelling it after Leinster House in Dublin; of painters like Charles\r\nIngham, W.G. Wall, William Magrath, the Morans, James Hamilton, and\r\nThomas Hovenden; and of sculptors like John Donoghue, John Flanagan,\r\nAndrew O'Connor, John F. Kelly, Jerome Connor, John J. Boyle, and\r\nMartin Milmore. But they belong rather to the history of American art\r\nthan to that of Ireland.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of Irish sculpture, the work of the\r\nmedallists, an allied branch of the art in which Irishmen did much\r\nvalued work, should not be overlooked. The medals of William Mossop\r\n(1751-1805), of his son, William Stephen Mossop (1788-1827), and of\r\nJohn Woodhouse (1835-1892), to mention only three of its chief\r\nrepresentatives in Ireland, are greatly prized by collectors.\r\n\r\nMost modern Irish art of high importance has been largely produced\r\nout of Ireland, which has been perforce abandoned by those artists\r\nwho have learned how little encouragement is to be met with at home.\r\nOne can blame neither the artist nor the Irish public for this\r\nunfortunate result; there is sufficient reason in the political and\r\neconomic condition of Ireland since the Union to explain the fact.\r\nBut for this cause men like Daniel Maclise, R.A. (1806-1870), William\r\nMulready, R.A. (1786-1863), Francis Danby, A.R.A. (1793-1861), and\r\nAlfred Elmore, R.A. (1815-1881), might have endeavored to emulate the\r\nspirit of James O'Connor (1792-1841), the landscapist, Richard\r\nRothwell (1800-1868), a charming subject painter, and Sir Frederic W.\r\nBurton (1816-1900), one of the most distinguished artists of his\r\ntime, who at least spent some of their active working career in their\r\nnative land. The same words apply to artists who succeeded in other\r\nbranches of the profession, men like John Doyle (1797-1868), a\r\ncaricaturist with all the power, without the coarseness, of his\r\npredecessors; his son, Richard Doyle (1824-1883), a refined and\r\ndelicate artist; John Leech (1817-1864), the humorist, a member of an\r\nIrish Catholic family; Paul Gray (1842-1866), who died before his\r\npowers had fully matured; and Matthew James Lawless (1837-1864), who\r\nalso died too early. William Collins, R.A. (1788-1847) and Clarkson\r\nStanfield, R.A. (1793-1867), both eminent representatives of English\r\nart, though of Irish extraction, more properly belong to England than\r\nto Ireland.\r\n\r\nNot discouraged by the melancholy history of many gifted Irish\r\nartists, Ireland still produces men who are not unworthy of\r\nassociation with the best who have gone before. Our most recent\r\nlosses have been heavy--notably those of Walter F. Osborne\r\n(1859-1903) and Patrick Vincent Duffy (1832-1909), but we still have\r\nartists of genius in the persons of Nathaniel Hone, a direct\r\ndescendant of his famous namesake; John Butler Yeats; John Lavery,\r\nA.R.A.; and William Orpen, A.R.A. Many other names might be given,\r\nbut already this attempt at a survey suffers by its enumeration of\r\nartists, who, however, could hardly be neglected in such a record.\r\n\r\nCrowded as the list may be, it is a careful selection, and it\r\ndemonstrates that, notwithstanding all the disadvantages under which\r\nIreland suffers, the country has an almost unlimited capacity for\r\nfine achievement, and that, with prosperity and contentment, she may\r\nbe expected to rival the most illustrious of art centres. It is only\r\nwithin living memory that any attempt has been made to direct the\r\nknown artistic skill of the Irish people to industrial effort. But\r\nthe remarkable success achieved in the modern designs for Irish lace\r\nin the English art competitions is an instance of what might be done\r\ngenerally in the applied arts. Though they are in their infancy, the\r\nnew carpet and stained glass industries in Ireland also hold out\r\nconsiderable hope for the future. But one can only barely indicate\r\nwhat has been and might be done in the furtherance of Irish art. If\r\nwe only had under one roof a judiciously made collection of all the\r\nbest work done by Irish artists of all styles and periods, it would\r\nmore eloquently justify our claim than endless columns of praise.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nAnthony Pasquin [John Williams]: History of Professors of Painting in\r\nIreland (1795); T.J.

HEALY,\r\n\r\n_Editor of \"Sport,\" Dublin_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the face of the earth there is no nation in which the love of\r\nclean and wholesome sport is more strongly developed than in the\r\nIrish. Against us it cannot be urged that we take our pleasures\r\nsadly. We enter into them with entire self-abandon, whole-hearted\r\nenthusiasm, and genuine exuberance of spirit. There is nothing\r\ncounterfeit about the Irishman in his play. His one keen desire is to\r\nwin, be the contest what it may; and towards the achievement of that\r\nend he will strain nerve and muscle even to the point of utter\r\nexhaustion. And how the onlookers applaud at the spectacle of a\r\ndesperately contested race, whether between horses, men, motorcars,\r\nbicycles, or boats, or of a match between football, hurling, or\r\ncricket teams! It matters not which horse, man, car, cycle, boat, or\r\nteam is successful: the sport is the thing that counts; the\r\nstrenuousness of the contest is what stimulates and evokes the\r\nrapturous applause. At such a moment it is good to be alive. Scenes\r\nsimilar to those hinted at may be witnessed on any sports-field or\r\nracetrack in our dear little Emerald Isle almost any day of the year.\r\nAll is good fellowship; all is in the cause of sport.\r\n\r\nNo one can question that in some departments of horse-racing Ireland\r\nis today supreme. The Irish devotion to the horse is of no recent\r\ngrowth. Everybody knows how, in the dim and distant days when King\r\nConor macNessa ruled at Emain, the war-steeds of the Ultonians\r\nneighed loudly in their stalls on the first dramatic appearance of\r\nCuchulainn of Muirthemne at the northern court. Cuchulainn's own two\r\nsteeds, Liath Macha, \"the Roan of Macha\", and Dub Sainglenn, \"Black\r\nSanglan\", are celebrated in story and song:\r\n\r\n      Never hoofs like them shall ring,\r\n      Rapid as the winds of spring.\r\n\r\nTo read of the performances of Cuchulainn and his war-horses and his\r\ncharioteer and friend, Laeg macRiangahra, at the famous battle of\r\nRosnaree, and again at the last fight between the Red Branch Knights\r\nand the forces of Queen Medb of Connacht, does truly, in the words\r\nused by Sir Philip Sidney in another connection, stir the heart like\r\nthe sound of a trumpet.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, the Irish war-horse became more and more famous, and\r\nalways carried his rider in gallant style. Stout was the steed that,\r\nbestridden by Godfrey O'Donnell at the battle of Credan-Kille,\r\nwithstood the shock of Lord Maurice Fitzgerald's desperate onslaught,\r\nand by his steadiness enabled the Tyrconnell chieftain to strike\r\nsenseless and unhorse his fierce Norman foe. More celebrated still\r\nwas the high-spirited animal which Art MacMurrogh rode in 1399 to his\r\nineffectual parley with King Richard the Second's representative, the\r\nEarl of Gloucester. The French chronicler who was a witness of that\r\nhistoric scene tells us that a horse more exquisitely beautiful, more\r\nmarvellously fleet, he had never seen. \"In coming down,\" he says, \"it\r\ngalloped so hard that, in my opinion, I never saw hare, deer, sheep,\r\nor any other animal, I declare to you for a certainty, run with such\r\nspeed as it did.\" Edmund Spenser, the poet of _The Faerie Queene_,\r\nwriting in 1596, bears this striking testimony to the Irish\r\nhorse-soldier and inferentially to the Irish horse: \"I have hearde\r\nsome greate warriours say, that, in all the services which they had\r\nseene abroade in forrayne countreys, they never sawe a more comely\r\nhorseman than the Irish man, nor that cometh on more bravely in his\r\ncharge.\" The feats performed at the Battle of the Boyne, in 1690, by\r\nthe Irish horse-soldiers under Hamilton and Berwick were really\r\nwonderful, and well-nigh turned disaster into victory on that\r\nmemorable day which decided the fate of nations as well as of\r\ndynasties. And surely those were fleet and stout-hearted steeds that,\r\non August 12, 1690, carried Sarsfield and his chosen five hundred on\r\ntheir dare-devil midnight ride from the Keeper Hills to Ballyneety,\r\nwhere in the dim morning twilight they captured and destroyed William\r\nof Orange's wonderful siege-train, and thereby heartened the\r\ndefenders of beleaguered Limerick.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1809, Lawrence, in his _History and Delineation of the\r\nHorse_, said: \"From Ireland alone we import [into England] many\r\nsaddle horses, as many perhaps as 1,500 in a year; upwards in some\r\nyears. The Irish are the highest and steadiest leapers in the world.\r\nIreland has bred some good racers, and the generality of Irish horses\r\nare, it appears, warmer tempered than our own; and, to use the\r\nexpression, sharper and more frigate-built.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at therefore if in such a country there\r\ndeveloped an ardent love of the noble sport of horse-racing. The\r\nCurragh of Kildare, the long-standing headquarters of the Irish Turf\r\nClub, was celebrated far back in the eighteenth century as the venue\r\nof some great equine contests; and to this day, with its five\r\nimportant fixtures every year, it still holds pride of place. There\r\nare numerous other race-courses all over the country, from\r\nPunchestown, Leopardstown, Phoenix Park, and Baldoyle in the east to\r\nGalway in the west, and from The Maze in the north to rebel Cork in\r\nthe south. Horse-racing has not inappropriately been termed the\r\nnational pastime of Ireland. The number of people now giving their\r\nattention to it has called for a notable increase in the number of\r\nrace-meetings, and stake-money is being put up on a more generous\r\nscale than at any previous time in the history of the sport. For\r\nexample, the Irish Derby, run at the Curragh, was in 1914 worth\r\n£2,500; and there are besides several stakes of £1,500 and £1,000.\r\nThe result of this forward policy is that increasing numbers come to\r\nour race-meetings and that the turf has never been more popular than\r\nit is today. Men and women of wealth and position find in the\r\nnational pastime a pleasant method of employing their leisure, and in\r\nexpending their surplus wealth in its pursuit and in the raising of\r\nhorses of the highest class they realize that they confer a real\r\nbenefit on the country.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, now universally known that Ireland has an\r\ninternational reputation as a country eminently fitted for\r\nhorse-breeding. If proof were needed, it would be found in the\r\nextensive purchases effected by English, French, Italian, German,\r\nRussian, and American buyers at the great Dublin Horse Show held in\r\nAugust every year. Horses bought in Ireland have seldom failed to\r\nrealize their promise. The English classic races and many of the\r\nprincipal handicaps on the flat have been often won by Irish-bred\r\nhorses, such as Galtee More, Ard Patrick, Orby, Kilwarlin,\r\nBarcaldine, Umpire, Master Kildare, Kilsallaghan, Bendigo, Philomel,\r\nThe Rejected, Comedy, Winkfield's Pride, Bellevin, Royal Flush,\r\nVictor Wild, Bachelor's Button, Irish Ivy, and Hackler's Pride. If\r\nonly a few of the star performers are here set down, it is not from\r\nlack of means to continue, but merely from a desire to avoid the\r\ncompilation of a mere string of names. In France, too, the Irish\r\nracer has made his mark. It is, however, in the four-and-a-half\r\nmiles' Liverpool Grand National Steeplechase, the greatest\r\ncross-country race in the world, the supreme test of the leaper,\r\ngalloper, and stayer, that Irish-bred horses have made perhaps the\r\nmost wonderful record. The list of winners of that great event\r\ndemonstrates in an unmistakable manner that we are second to none in\r\nthe art of breeding steeplechase horses. Among many other noted\r\nIrish-bred winners of this race there stand boldly forth the names of\r\nThe Lamb, Empress, Woodbrook, Frigate, Come Away, Cloister, Wild Man\r\nfrom Borneo, and Manifesto. In fact, it is the exception when another\r\nthan an Irish-bred horse annexes the blue riband of steeplechasing.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to horse-racing is fox-hunting, and fox-hunting, as\r\nwell as the hunting of the stag and of the hare, has flourished\r\nexceedingly in Ireland for a long time past. A great deal of needed\r\nemployment is one of the results. Dogs are specially bred and trained\r\nfor each of these branches of sport. Irish foxhounds, staghounds,\r\nharriers, and beagles have a high reputation. More native to the\r\nsoil, and so interwoven with the history of the country that it is\r\noften used as one of its symbols, is the Irish wolfhound. This is\r\nprobably the animal to which Aurelius Symmachus, a Roman consul in\r\nBritain, referred when, writing to his brother in Ireland in A.D.\r\n391, he acknowledged the receipt of seven Irish hounds. The wolfhound\r\nplayed a sinister part in the Irish history of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, for, as Davis says in his poem, \"The Penal Days\":\r\n\r\n      Their dogs were taught alike to run\r\n      Upon the scent of wolf and friar.\r\n\r\nThe Irish wolfhound is now very scarce, and a genuine specimen is a\r\nvalued and highly coveted possession. The greyhound, too, figures\r\nprominently in present-day sport, and in many parts of the country\r\nare held coursing meetings, which frequently result in several\r\nspirited contests. A famous Irish greyhound was Lord Lurgan's black\r\nand white dog, Master McGrath. Master McGrath achieved the rare\r\ndistinction of winning the Waterloo Cup three times, in 1868, 1869,\r\nand 1871. When it is remembered that the Waterloo Cup is to coursing\r\nwhat the Liverpool Grand National is to steeplechasing, or the Epsom\r\nDerby to flat racing, the merit of this triple performance will at\r\nonce be apparent.\r\n\r\nCompared with the sports in which horse and hound participate, all\r\nother outdoor pastimes in Ireland take rather a minor place. Still,\r\nthe Irishman's love of sport is diversified. Few there are who have\r\nnot many inclinations, and as a nation our taste in sport is\r\ncatholic. We take part in nearly every pastime; in many we excel. The\r\nprize ring has fallen from its high estate, nor is it the intention\r\nhere to try to cast any glamour over it. The subject is introduced,\r\nin a passing way, for the sole purpose of showing that, in what at\r\nleast used to be the manly art of self-defense, Ireland in days gone\r\nby as well as at the present time has more than held her own. The\r\nmost conspicuous of the representatives of her race in this\r\ndepartment are perhaps Heenan, Ryan, Sullivan, Corbett, Maher,\r\nMcAuliffe, McFarland, and McGoorty. There is one other prize-fighter,\r\nDan Donnelly by name, who became a sort of national hero, of whom all\r\nIrishmen of his day were not a little proud, because he laid the\r\nEnglish champion low, and whose performance, now haloed by the\r\nantiquity of more than a hundred years, we may with equanimity, as\r\nwithout offense, contemplate, with perhaps a sigh for the good old\r\ntimes. The famous encounter between Donnelly and Cooper took place on\r\nthe Curragh, and after eleven rounds of scientific boxing Donnelly\r\nknocked his opponent over the ropes and won the world's championship\r\nfor the Emerald Isle. The spot where the battle came off has ever\r\nsince been known as Donnelly's Hollow, and a neat monument there\r\nerected commemorates the Dublin man's pluck and skill. A ballad\r\nrecounting the incidents of the fight and, as ballads go, not badly\r\ncomposed, had a wonderful vogue, and was sung at fair and market and\r\nother meeting place within the memory of men who are not now more\r\nthan middle-aged.\r\n\r\nA search in other domains of sport will be by no means barren of\r\nresults. Take running, for instance. Who has not heard of the\r\nwondrous little Thomas Conneff from the short-grass county of\r\nKildare? Who does not know of his brilliant performances on the\r\ntrack? We in Ireland, who had seen him defeat Carter, the great\r\nCanadian, over the four-mile course at Ballsbridge one summer's eve\r\nnow nearly twenty golden years ago, knew his worth before he crossed\r\nthe broad Atlantic to show to thousands of admiring spectators in\r\nAmerica that Ireland was the breeder of fleet-footed sons, who lacked\r\nneither the courage, nor the thews and sinews, nor the staying power,\r\nto carry them at high speed over any distance of ground. May the\r\nearth lie light on Conneff, for in a small body he had a great heart!\r\nThen there was the mighty runner, James J. Daly, a true hero from\r\nGalway, the idol of the crowd in his native land as well as in the\r\nUnited States. Daly was the champion long distance cross-country\r\nrunner of his day at home, and he showed before various nationalities\r\nin the Greater Ireland beyond the seas that he could successfully\r\ncompete with the best from all countries.\r\n\r\nIn high jumping, Patrick Davin, P. Leahy, and Peter O'Connor were for\r\nlong in the foremost rank; Daniel Ahearne was famous for his\r\nhop-step-and-jump performance; Maurice Davin, Matthew McGrath, and\r\nPatrick Ryan have, each in his own day, thrown the 16-pound hammer to\r\nrecord distance; in shot-putting there are Sheridan, Horgan, John\r\nFlanagan, and others bearing true Irish names, who are right in\r\nfront; and before their time we had a redoubted champion in W.J.M.\r\nBarry. All previous performances in the shot-putting line have,\r\nhowever, been recently eclipsed by Patrick J. McDonald, of the\r\nIrish-American Club, who at Celtic Park, Long Island, on May 30,\r\n1914, made a new world's record by putting the 18-pound shot 46 feet\r\n2-3/4 inches. The climax of achievement was reached when T.F. Kiely\r\nwon the all-round championship of the world at New York. The\r\ndistinguished part taken by Irishmen or sons of Irishmen in all\r\ndepartments of the Olympic games is so recent and so well known as to\r\ncall for no comment. Ireland is far indeed from being degenerate in\r\nher athletes.\r\n\r\nIn international strife with England, Scotland, Wales, and France at\r\nRugby football, Ireland has likewise won her spurs. She has never\r\nbeen beaten by the representatives of Gaul; and though for long\r\nenough she had invariably to succumb in competition with the other\r\nthree countries, such is not the case nowadays, nor has it been for\r\nmany years past. The Irish team has ever to be reckoned with. In\r\nAssociation football, too, Ireland is coming into her own. This\r\nbranch of the game has developed enormously within a comparatively\r\nfew seasons. The people flock in their thousands to witness matches\r\nfor the principal league contests or cup ties. But the greatest\r\ncrowds of all go to see Gaelic football, the national game; and to\r\nhurling, also distinctively Irish, they foregather in serried masses.\r\nSince the Gaelic Athletic Association was founded both football and\r\nhurling have prospered exceedingly. They are essentially popular\r\nforms of sport, and the muscular manhood of city and country finds in\r\nthem a natural outlet for their characteristic Celtic vigor. The\r\nGaelic Association has fostered and developed these sports, and has\r\norganized them on so sound a basis that interest in them is not\r\nconfined to any particular district but spreads throughout the length\r\nand breadth of Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhen the America Cup was to be challenged for, into the breach\r\nstepped the Earl of Dunraven and flung his gage to the holders of the\r\ntrophy. This distinguished Irish nobleman furnished a contender in\r\nhis Valkyrie II. in the fall of 1893, and his patriotic spirit in\r\ndoing so stirred the sport-loving Irish nation to the greatest\r\nenthusiasm. His lordship was not successful, but he was not\r\ndisheartened. He tried again with Valkyrie III., but again he was\r\nonly second best, for, though his yacht sailed to victory in home\r\nwaters, she proved unequal to the task of lifting the cup. No\r\nEnglishman was prepared to tempt fortune, but not so that sterling\r\nIrishman, Sir Thomas Lipton, who, win or lose, would not have it laid\r\nto the charge of Ireland that an attempt should not be made. His\r\nShamrock, Shamrock II., and Shamrock III.--surely a deep sense of\r\npatriotism prompted nomenclature such as that--each in succession\r\nwent down to defeat; but Sir Thomas has not done yet. Like King\r\nBruce, he is going to try again, and Shamrock IV. is to do battle\r\nwith the best that America can range against her. All honor to Lord\r\nDunraven and to Sir Thomas Lipton for their persistent efforts to\r\nengage in generous rivalry with the yachtsmen across the sea.\r\n\r\nLawn-tennis, cricket, and golf we play, and play well; to rowing many\r\nof us are enthusiastically devoted; and at handball our young\r\nmen--and some not so young--are signally expert. The champion\r\nhandball player has always been of Irish blood. Baseball we\r\ninvented--and called it rounders. It is significant that the great\r\nAmerican ball game is still played according to a code which is\r\nscarcely modified from that which may be seen in force any summer day\r\non an Irish school field or village green. Perhaps something of\r\nhereditary instinct is to be traced in the fact that many of the best\r\nexponents of American baseball are the bearers of fine old Irish\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThis brief and cursory review of Ireland at Play must now conclude.\r\nIt is scarcely more than a glossary, and not a complete one at that.\r\nIt may, however, serve to show that Ireland's record in sport, like\r\nher record in so many other things set forth in this book, is great\r\nand glorious enough to warrant the insertion of this short chapter\r\namong those which tell of old achievements and feats of high emprize.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nRacing--Irish Racing Calendar: 1790-1914, 124 vols.

CLARKE,\r\n\r\n_President, American Irish Historical Society_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--THE FIGHTING RACE AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\"War was the ruling passion of this people,\" says MacGeoghegan,\r\nmeaning the Milesians who were the latest of the peoples that overran\r\nancient Ireland up to the coming of Christ. How many races had\r\npreceded them remains an enigma of history not profitable to examine\r\nhere, but whoever they were, or in what succession they arrived, they\r\nmust, like all migrating people, have been prepared to establish\r\nthemselves at the point of the spear and the edge of the sword. Two\r\nraces certainly were mingled in the ancient Irish, the fair or auburn\r\nhaired with blue eyes, and the dark haired with eyes of gray or\r\nbrown. The Milesians appear to have reached Ireland through Spain.\r\nThey came swiftly to power, more than a thousand years before our\r\nLord, and divided the country into four provinces or kingdoms, with\r\nan _ard-ri_, or high-king, ruling all in a loose way as to service,\r\ntaxes, and allegiance. The economic life was almost entirely\r\npastoral. Riches were counted in herds of cattle. \"Robustness of\r\nframe, vehemence of passion, elevated imagination,\" Dr. Leland says,\r\nsignalized this people. Robust, they became athletic and vigorous and\r\nexcelled in the use of deadly weapons; passionate, they easily went\r\nfrom litigation to blows; imaginative, they leaned toward poetry and\r\nsong and were strong for whatever religion they practised. The latter\r\nwas a polytheism brought close to the people through the Druids. Some\r\nstone weapons were doubtless still used; they had also brazen or\r\nbronze swords, and spears, axes, and maces of various alloys of\r\ncopper and tin. Socially they remained tribal. Heads of tribes were\r\npetty kings, each with his stronghold of a primitive character, each\r\nwith his tribal warriors, bards, harpers, and druids, and the whole\r\nmale population more or less ready to take part in war.\r\n\r\nThe great heroes whose names have come down to us, such as Finn, son\r\nof Cumhal, and Cuchulainn, were reared in a school of arms. Bravery\r\nwas the sign of true manhood. A law of chivalry moderated the excess\r\nof combat. A trained militia, the Fianna, gave character to an era;\r\nthe Knights of the Red Branch were the distinguishing order of\r\nchevaliers. The songs of the bards were songs of battle; the great\r\nIrish epic of antiquity was the_ Táin Bó Cúalnge_, or Cooley\r\nCattle-raid, and it is full of combats and feats of strength and\r\nprowess. High character meant high pride, always ready to give\r\naccount of itself and strike for its ideals: \"Irritable and bold\", as\r\none historian has it. They were jealous and quick to anger, but\r\nlight-hearted laughter came easily to the lips of the ancient Irish.\r\nThey worked cheerfully, prayed fervently to their gods, loved their\r\nwomen and children devotedly, clung passionately to their clan, and\r\nfought at the call with alacrity.\r\n\r\nNothing, it will be seen, could be further from the minds of such a\r\npeople than submission to what they deemed injustice. The habit of a\r\nproud freedom was ingrained. Their little island of 32,000 square\r\nmiles in the Atlantic Ocean, the outpost of Europe, lay isolated save\r\nfor occasional forays to and from the coasts of Scotland and England.\r\nThe Roman invasions of western Europe never reached it. England the\r\nRomans overran, but never Scotland or Ireland. Self-contained,\r\nIreland developed a civilization peculiarly its own, the product of\r\nan intense, imaginative, fighting race. War was not constant among\r\nthem by any means, and occupied only small portions of the island at\r\na time, but, since the bards' best work was war songs and war\r\nhistories, with much braggadocio doubtless intermixed, a different\r\nimpression might prevail. Half of their kings may have been killed in\r\nbroil or battle, and yet great wars were few. If is undoubted that\r\nScotic, that is, Irish, invasion and immigration peopled the western\r\nshores of Scotland and gave a name to the country. In the first\r\ncenturies of the Christian era they were the men who with the Picts\r\nfought the Romans at the wall of Severus. The Britons, it will be\r\nremembered, enervated by Roman dominance, had failed to defend their\r\n\"border\" when Rome first withdrew her legions.\r\n\r\nAt this time, too, began the first appearance of Ireland as a power\r\non the sea. In the fourth century the high-king, Niall of the\r\nHostages, commanding a large fleet of war galleys, invaded Scotland,\r\nravaged the English coasts, and conquered Armorica (Brittany),\r\npenetrating as far as the banks of the Loire, where, according to the\r\nlegend, he was slain by an arrow shot by one of his own men. One of\r\nthe captives he brought from abroad on one of his early expeditions\r\nwas a youth named Patrick, afterwards to be the Apostle of Ireland.\r\nNiall's nephew, Dathi, also ard-ri, was a great sea king. He invaded\r\nEngland, crossed to Gaul, and marched as far as the Alps, where he\r\nwas killed by lightning. He was the last pagan king of Ireland. In\r\nperhaps a score of years after the death of Dathi, all Ireland had\r\nbeen converted to Christianity, and its old religion of a thousand\r\nyears buried so deep that scholars find the greatest difficulty in\r\nrecovering anything about it. This conservative, obstinate, jealous\r\npeople overturned its pagan altars in a night, and, ever since, has\r\nnever put into anything else the devotion, soul and body, of its\r\nsacrifices for religion. Christianity profoundly modified Irish life,\r\nsoftened manners, and stimulated learning. Not that the fighting\r\npropensities were obliterated. There were indeed many long and\r\npeaceful reigns, but the historians record neat little wars,\r\nseductive forays and \"hostings\", to use the new-old word, to the\r\nheart's content. The Irish character remained fixed in its\r\nessentials, but, under the influence of religious enthusiasm, Ireland\r\nprogressed and prospered in the arts of peace. It would undoubtedly\r\nhave shared the full progress of western Europe from this time on,\r\nbut for its insularity. Hitherto its protection, it was now to be its\r\ndownfall. A hostile power was growing of which it knew nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Norsemen--the hardy vikings of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark--had\r\nbecome a nation of pirates. Undaunted fighters and able mariners,\r\nthey built their shapely long ships and galleys of the northern pine\r\nand oak, and swept hardily down on the coasts of England, Ireland,\r\nFrance, Spain, and Italy, and the lands of the Levant, surprising,\r\nmassacring, plundering. In France (Normandy), in England, and lastly\r\nin Ireland they planted colonies. Their greatest success was in\r\nEngland, which they conquered, Canute becoming king. Their greatest\r\nbattles and final defeat were in Ireland. From the end of the eighth\r\ncentury to the beginning of the eleventh the four shores of Erin were\r\nattacked in turn, and sometimes all together, by successive fleets of\r\nthe Norsemen. The waters that had been Ireland's protection now\r\nbecame the high roads of the invaders. By the river Shannon they\r\npushed their conquests into the heart of the country. Dublin Bay,\r\nWaterford Harbor, Belfast Lough, and the Cove of Cork offered shelter\r\nto their vessels. They established themselves in Dublin and raided\r\nthe country around. Churches and monasteries were sacked and burned.\r\nTo the end these Norsemen were robbers rather than settlers. To these\r\nonslaughts by the myriad wasps of the northern seas, again and again\r\nrenewed, the Irish responded manfully. In 812 they drove off the\r\ninvaders with great slaughter, only to find fresh hordes descending a\r\nyear or two later. In the tenth century, Turgesius, the Danish\r\nleader, called himself monarch of Ireland, but he was driven out by\r\nthe Irish king, Malachi. The great effort which really broke the\r\nDanish power forever in Ireland was at the battle of Clontarf, on\r\nDublin Bay, Good Friday, 1014, when King Brian Boru, at the head of\r\n30,000 men, utterly defeated the Danes of Dublin and the Danes of\r\noversea. Fragments of the Northmen remained all over Ireland, but\r\nhenceforth they gradually merged with the Irish people, adding a\r\nnotable element to it's blood. One of the most grievous chapters of\r\nIrish history, the period of Norse invasion, literally shines with\r\nIrish valor and tenacity, undimmed through six fighting generations.\r\nAs Plowden says:\r\n\r\n\"Ireland stands conspicuous among the nations of the universe, a\r\nsolitary instance in which neither the destructive hand of time, nor\r\nthe devastating arm of oppression, nor the widest variety of changes\r\nin the political system of government could alter or subdue, much\r\nless wholly extinguish, the national genius, spirit, and character of\r\nits inhabitants.\" This is true not only of the Danish wars which\r\nended nine hundred years ago, but of many a dreadful century since\r\nand to this very day.\r\n\r\nNow followed a troubled period, Ireland weakened by loss of blood and\r\ntreasure, its government failing of authority through the defects of\r\nits virtues. It was inevitable, sooner or later, that England, as it\r\nbecame consolidated after its conquest by William the Norman, should\r\nturn greedy eyes on the fair land across the Irish sea. It was in\r\n1169 that \"Strongbow\"--Richard, earl of Pembroke--came from England\r\nat the invitation of a discontented Irish chieftain and began the\r\nconquest of Ireland. Three years later came Henry II. with more\r\ntroops and a Papal bull. After a campaign in Leinster, he set himself\r\nup as overlord of Ireland, and then returned to London. It was the\r\nbeginning only. An English Lord Deputy ruled the \"Pale\", or portion\r\nof Ireland that England held more or less securely, and from that\r\nvantage ground made spasmodic war upon the rest of Ireland, and was\r\nforever warred on, in large attacks and small, by Irish chieftains.\r\n\r\nThe Irish were the fighting race now if ever. Without hope of outside\r\nassistance, facing a foe ever reinforced from a stronger, richer,\r\nmore fully organized country, nothing but their stubborn character\r\nand their fighting genius kept them in the field. And century out and\r\ncentury in, they stayed, holding back the foreign foe four hundred\r\nyears. It is worthy of note that it was the Norman English, racial\r\ncousins, as it were, of the Norsemen, who first wrought at the\r\nEnglish conquest of Ireland. When some of these were seated in Irish\r\nplaces of pride, when a Butler was made Earl of Ormond and a\r\nFitzgerald, Earl of Kildare, it was soon seen that they were merging\r\nrapidly in the Irish mass, becoming, as it was said, \"more Irish than\r\nthe Irish themselves.\" Many were the individual heroic efforts to\r\nstrike down the English power. Here and there small Irish chiefs\r\naccepted the English rule, offsetting the Norman Irish families who\r\nat times were \"loyal\" and at times \"rebel.\" The state of war became\r\ncontinuous and internecine, but three-fourths of Ireland remained\r\nunconquered. The idea of a united Ireland against England had,\r\nhowever, been lost except in a few exalted and a few desperate\r\nbreasts. A gleam of hope came in 1316, when, two years after the\r\ngreat defeat of England by the Scotch under Robert the Bruce at\r\nBannockburn, Edward, the victor-king's brother, came at the\r\ninvitation of the northern Irish to Ireland with 6,000 Scots, landing\r\nnear Carrickfergus. He was proclaimed king of Ireland by the Irish\r\nwho joined him. Battle after battle was won by the allies. Edward was\r\na brilliant soldier, lacking, however, the prudence of his great\r\nbrother, Robert. The story of his two years of fighting, ravaging,\r\nand slaying, is hard at this distance to reconcile with intelligible\r\nstrategy. In the end, in 1318, the gallant Scot fell in battle near\r\nDundalk, losing at the same time two-thirds of his army. For two\r\nyears Scot and Irish had fought victoriously side by side. That is\r\nthe fact of moment that comes out of this dark period.\r\n\r\nThe following century, like that which had gone before, was full of\r\nfighting. In 1399, on Richard II.'s second visit to Ireland, he met\r\nfierce opposition from the Irish septs. MacMorrough, fighting,\r\nharassing the king's army from the shelter of the Wicklow woods,\r\nfairly drove the king to Dublin. The sanguinary \"Wars of the\r\nRoses\"--that thirty years' struggle for the crown of England between\r\nthe royal houses of York and Lancaster, 1455 to 1485--gave Ireland a\r\nlong opportunity, which, however, she was too weak to turn to\r\nadvantage; but fighting between Irish and English went on just the\r\nsame, now in one province, now in another.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry VIII. a revolt against England started within\r\nthe Pale itself, when Lord Thomas Fitzgerald, known as Silken Thomas,\r\nwent before the Council in Dublin and publicly renounced his\r\nallegiance. He took the field--a brave, striking figure--in protest\r\nagainst the king's bad faith in dealing with his father, the Earl of\r\nKildare. At one time it looked as if the rebellion (it was the first\r\nreal Irish rebellion) would prosper. Lord Thomas made combinations\r\nwith Irish chieftains in the north and west, and was victor in\r\nseveral engagements. He finally surrendered with assurances of\r\npardon, but, as in many similar cases, was treacherously sent a\r\nprisoner to London, where he was executed.\r\n\r\nQueen Mary's reign was one of comparative quiet in Ireland. Her\r\npolicy towards the Catholics was held to be of good augury for\r\nIreland. The English garrison was reduced with impunity to 500 foot\r\nand a few horse: but another and darker day came with Elizabeth. Her\r\ncoming to the throne, together with her fanatic devotion to the\r\nReformation and an equal hatred of the old religion and all who clung\r\nto it, ushered in for Ireland two and a half centuries of almost\r\nunbroken misfortune. You cannot make people over. Some may take their\r\nopinions with their interest; others prefer to die rather than\r\nsurrender theirs, and glory in the sacrifice. The proclamations of\r\nElizabeth had no persuasion in them for the Irish. Her proscriptions\r\nwere only another English sword at Ireland's throat. The disdain of\r\nthe Irish maddened her. During her long reign one campaign after\r\nanother was launched against them. Always fresh soldier hordes came\r\npouring in under able commanders and marched forth from the Pale,\r\ngenerally to return shattered and worn down by constant harrying,\r\nsometimes utterly defeated with great slaughter. So of Henry Sidney's\r\ncampaign, and so of the ill-fated Essex. Ulster, the stronghold of\r\nthe O'Neills and the O'Donnells, remained unconquered down to the\r\nlast years of Elizabeth's reign, although most of the greater battles\r\nwere fought there. In Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, and \"Red\" Hugh\r\nO'Donnell, prince of Tyrconnell, Ireland had two really great\r\nsoldiers on her side. The bravery, generalship, prudence, and\r\nstrategy of O'Neill were worthy of all praise, and Red Hugh fell\r\nlittle short of his great compatriot. In battle after battle for\r\ntwenty years they defeated the English with slaughter. Ireland, if\r\nmore and more devastated by campaigns and forays, became the grave of\r\ntens of thousands of English soldiers and scores of high reputations.\r\nWriting from Cork, the Earl of Essex, after a disastrous march\r\nthrough Leinster and Munster, says:\r\n\r\n\"I am confined in Cork ... but still I have been unsuccessful; my\r\nundertakings have been attended with misfortune.... The Irish are\r\nstronger and handle their arms with more skill than our people; they\r\ndiffer from us also in point of discipline. They likewise avoid\r\npitched battles where order must be observed, and prefer skirmishes\r\nand petty warfare ... and are obstinately opposed to the English\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThey did not like attacking or defending fortified places, he also\r\nbelieved. It was only his experience. The campaigns of Shane O'Neill,\r\na bold but ill-balanced warrior, were full of such attacks, but one\r\npotent cause for Irish reluctance to make sieges a strong point of\r\ntheir strategy was that the strongest fortresses were on the sea. An\r\ninexhaustible, powerful enemy who held the sea was not in the end to\r\nbe denied on sea or land, but the Irish in stubborn despair or\r\nsupreme indifference to fate fought on. Religious rancor was added to\r\nracial hate. Most of the English settlers, or \"garrison,\" as they\r\ncame to be called, had become Protestants at the royal order. Ruin\r\nperched upon Ireland's hills and made a wilderness of her fertile\r\nvalleys. The Irish chieftains with their faithful followers moved\r\nfrom place to place in woods and hollows of the hills. English\r\ncolonists were settled on confiscated lands, and were harried by\r\nthose who had been driven from their homes. It was war among graves.\r\nAt last O'Neill made composition with the government when all was\r\nlost in the field, but the passionate Irish resolve never to submit\r\nstill stalked like a ghost, as if it could not perish.\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth died it was thought that better things were coming to\r\nIreland with James I., the son of Mary, Queen of Scots. Nothing of\r\nthe kind. That curiously minded creature at once made an ingenuous\r\nproclamation:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas his Majesty was informed that his subjects of Ireland had\r\nbeen deceived by _a false report that his Majesty was disposed to\r\nallow them liberty of conscience_ and the free choice of religion,\r\nnow, etc.\" Fresh \"transplanting\" of English and Scotch settlers on\r\nthe lands of the Irish was the gist of his answer to the \"false\r\nreports.\" So again the war of surprise, ambush, raid, and foray went\r\non in a hundred places at once, but the result was that the English\r\npower was even more firmly seated than before.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Charles I. there were terrible slaughters both of\r\nProtestants and Catholics. Patriotism and loyalty as moving causes\r\nhad disappeared, but religion fiercely took their place. With\r\nCromwell, the religious persecution took on an apocalyptic note of\r\nmassacre, but the Irish were still showing that they were there with\r\narms in their hands. The names of Owen Roe O'Neill and his splendid\r\nvictory, in 1646, at Benburb over the English and Scotch, where he\r\nslew more than 3,000 men, and of another Hugh O'Neill, who made such\r\na brilliant defense at Clonmel against Cromwell, shine brightly out\r\nof the darkness. But Ireland, parcelled out among the victors, was\r\nalways the weaker after every campaign. Waves of war swept over her.\r\nShe became mixed up in the rivalries of the English royal families,\r\nreligion playing the most important part in the differences. It had\r\narmed Henry and Elizabeth, James and Charles against her. It gave\r\nedge to Cromwell's sword, and it led her into a great effort on\r\nbehalf of James II. When William of Orange crossed the Boyne, all\r\nthat followed for a century was symbolized. Athlone, Aughrim,\r\nLimerick, all places of great and fierce contests, were decided\r\nagainst her. French support of a kind had James, but not enough.\r\nBravery and enthusiasm may win battles, but they do not carry through\r\ngreat campaigns. Once again God marched with the heaviest, best-fed,\r\nbest-armed battalions. The great Tyrone dying in exile at Rome, Red\r\nHugh O'Donnell perishing in Spain in the early days of the\r\nseventeenth century, were to prefigure the fighting and dying of half\r\na million Irish warriors on continental soil for a hundred years\r\nafter the fall of Limerick as the seventeenth century neared its\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nDuring that period the scattered bands of the Rapparees, half\r\npatriots, half robbers, hiding in mountain fastnesses, dispersing,\r\nreassembling, descending on the English estates for rapine or the\r\nkilling of \"objectionables,\" represented the only armed resistance of\r\nthe Irish. It was generally futile although picturesque.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the Revolutionary War in America, Ireland received\r\na new stimulation. The success of the patriots of the Irish\r\nparliament under Grattan, backed as they were by 100,000 volunteers\r\nand 130 pieces of cannon, in freeing Irish industry and commerce from\r\ntheir trammels, evoked the utmost malignity in England. Ireland\r\nalmost at once sprang to prosperity, but it was destined to be short\r\nlived. A great conspiracy, which did not at first show above the\r\nsurface, was set on foot to destroy the Irish parliament. This is not\r\nthe place to follow the sinister machinations of the English, save to\r\nnote that they forced both the Presbyterians and the Catholics of the\r\nnorth into preparations for revolt. The Society of United Irishmen\r\nwas formed, and drew many of the brightest and most cultivated men in\r\nIreland into its councils. It numbered over 70,000 adherents in\r\nUlster alone. The government was alarmed, and began a systematic\r\npersecution of the peasantry all over Ireland. English regiments were\r\nput at \"free quarters,\" that is, they forced themselves under order\r\ninto the houses and cabins of the people with demands for bed and\r\nboard. The hapless people were driven to fury. Brutal murders and\r\nbarbarous tortures of men and women by the soldiers, savage revenges\r\nby the peasantry, and every form of violent crime all at once\r\nprevailed in the lately peaceful valleys. Prosecutions of United\r\nIrishmen and executions were many. It was all done deliberately to\r\nprovoke revolt. In 1798 the revolt came. In the greater part of\r\nUlster and Munster the uprising failed, but a great insurrection of\r\nthe peasantry of Wexford shocked the country. Poorly armed, utterly\r\nundisciplined, without munitions of war, but 40,000 strong, they\r\nliterally flung themselves pike in hand on the English regiments,\r\nsweeping everything before them for a time. Father John Murphy, a\r\npriest and patriot, was one of their leaders, but Beauchamp Bagenal\r\nHarvey was soon their commander-in-chief. At one time the \"rebels\"\r\ndominated the entire county save for a fort in the harbor and a small\r\ntown or two, but it was natural that the commissariat should soon be\r\nin difficulties and their ammunition give out. The British general,\r\nLake, with an army of 20,000 men and a moving column of 13,000,\r\nattacked the rebels on Vinegar Hill, and although the fight was\r\nheroic and bloody while it lasted, it was soon over and the British\r\narmy was victorious. The rest was retreat, dispersal, and widespread\r\ncruelties and burnings and a long succession of murders. The \"Boys of\r\nWexford\" funder great difficulties had given a great account of\r\nthemselves. Dark as was that page of history, it has been a glowing\r\nlamp to Irish disaffection ever since. It is the soul of the effort\r\nthat counts, and the disasters do not discredit '98 in Irish eyes.\r\n\r\nVoltaire, in his _Century of Louis XIV._, made his reflection on the\r\nIrish soldier out of his limited knowledge of the Williamite war in\r\nIreland. He says, \"The Irish, whom we have seen such good soldiers in\r\nFrance and Spain, have always fought poorly at home\"! They had not\r\nfought poorly at home. It took four hundred years of English effort\r\nto complete, merely on its face, the conquest of Ireland, and all of\r\nthat long sweep of the sword of Time was a time of battle. The Irish\r\nwere fought with every appliance of war, backed by the riches of a\r\nprospering, strongly organized country, and impelled persistently by\r\nthe greed of land and love of mastery; but there was not a mountain\r\npass in Ireland, not a square mile of plain, not a river-ford, scarce\r\na hill that had not been piled high with English dead in that four\r\nhundred years at the hands of the Irish wielders of sword and spear\r\nand pike.\r\n\r\nThe Irish had not made their environment or their natures, and no\r\npower on earth could change them. Over greater England had swept the\r\nRomans, the Jutes, the Saxons, the Angles, the Norsemen, and the\r\nNormans. All found lodgment and all went to the making of England.\r\nWell, one might say, it had been for Ireland if she had developed\r\nthat assimilating power which made her successive conquerors in\r\nprocess of time the feeders of her greatness, but the Irish would not\r\nand could not. Instead, they developed the pride of race that no\r\nmomentary defeat could down. They became inured to battle and dreamt\r\nof battle when the peace of an hour was given them. When the four\r\nkings of Ireland were feasted in Dublin by King Richard II. of\r\nEngland, an English chronicler remarked, \"Never were men of ruder\r\nmanners\"; but neither the silken array and golden glitter of\r\nRichard's peripatetic court nor the brave display of his thousand\r\nknights and thirty thousand archers filled them with longing for the\r\none or fear of the other. They went back to their Irish hills and\r\nplains and fastnesses as obstinately Irish as ever.\r\n\r\nThey fought well at home, if unfortunately, the wonder being that\r\nthey continued to fight. The heavens and the earth seemed combined\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nII.--THE FIGHTING RACE ABROAD.\r\n\r\nWe next see Irish soldiers fighting abroad. The blood they had shed\r\nso freely for the Stuarts at the Boyne, at Athlone, at Aughrim, at\r\nLimerick was in vain. The king of France, if he sent armies to\r\nIreland, demanded Irish troops in return. The transports that brought\r\nthe French regiments over in May, 1690, took back over five thousand\r\nofficers and men from Ireland, who formed the first Irish Brigade in\r\nthe service of France. This, remember, was before the battle of the\r\nBoyne. The men were formed on their arrival in France into three\r\nregiments, those of Mountcashel, O'Brien, and Dillon, named after\r\ntheir commanders, and were sent to Savoy. The French aid to James in\r\nIreland helped best in giving confidence to the raw Irish levies, but\r\nit was more than offset by the German troops brought over by William.\r\nThe weakness, indecision, or worse, of James before Derry, his\r\nchicken-hearted failure to overwhelm Schomberg when he lay at his\r\nmercy before the arrival of William, ruined his chances. Remember\r\nthat the Irish army, if defeated at the Boyne, was not broken, and\r\nwas strong enough, when pursued by William, to repulse him with 500\r\nkilled and 1,000 wounded and to compel him to raise the siege of\r\nLimerick. The dash and skill of Patrick Sarsfield, Earl of Lucan,\r\nbacked by Irish desperation, won the day. The French troops sailed\r\nhome after William's retreat. In the next year's campaign occurred\r\nthe crowning disasters of the war, but in any other country or with\r\nany other people than the English the terms of capitulation at\r\nLimerick, which were formulated by Ginkel and showed a soldier's\r\nrespect for a brave and still powerful foe, would have ushered in an\r\nera of peace.\r\n\r\nThe Irish soldiers' distrust of the conquerors was shown in the fact\r\nthat, since the stipulations allowed the free departure of the\r\ngarrison with honors of war, 19,059 officers and men took service\r\nwith France, and sailed in October, 1691, on the French fleet, which\r\nby the irony of fate had arrived in the Shannon too late, on the very\r\nday after the signing of the treaty of Limerick. Never in the whole\r\ncourse of the history of nations has more hideous treachery been\r\nshown than in the immediate breaking of that treaty; and dearly has\r\nEngland paid for it ever since, although, for the hundred years that\r\nfollowed, Ireland sank to the very depths under the penal laws, with\r\nher trade ruined, her lands stolen, her religion persecuted, and all\r\neducation and enlightenment forbidden by abominable, drastic laws.\r\n\r\nIf, as has been computed, 450,000 Irish fought and died in the\r\nservice of France between 1690 and 1745, a further 30,000 are to be\r\nadded down to 1793. A French writer estimates the whole Irish\r\ncontingent at 750,000, but, for a roster of seekers of glory from an\r\nimpoverished people, the more reasonable half-million should surely\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\nLong would be the story to follow the fighting fortunes of the Irish\r\nBrigades. Officered by Irish gentlemen and drilled to perfection,\r\nthey soon came to hold in the French service the esteem that later\r\nwas given to Irish regiments in the service of England. King Louis\r\nwelcomed them heartily and paid them a higher wage than his native\r\nsoldiers. No duty was too arduous or too dangerous for the Irish\r\nBrigades. Seldom were they left to rust in idleness. Europe was a\r\ncaldron of wars of high ambitions.\r\n\r\nThe Irish regiments fought through the war in Flanders. At Landen,\r\nJuly 29, 1693, the French under the duke of Luxembourg defeated the\r\nEnglish under William III. with a slaughter of 10,473 men, losing\r\n8,000 men themselves. In the retreat, Ginkel, William's general in\r\nthe Irish campaign, was almost drowned in the river Greete. The Irish\r\nRoyal Regiment of Footguards, that of Dorrington, was the first corps\r\nto break through the English intrenchments, its gallant leader,\r\nColonel Barrett, falling as he headed the charge. Here also was\r\nstricken Lieutenant-Colonel Nugent of Sheldon's Irish Regiment. Here\r\nalso fell--saddest loss of all--Patrick Sarsfield, Earl of Lucan,\r\nbrave, resourceful, a true unfaltering-soldier and lover of his\r\ncountry. The legend of his life blood flowing before his eyes and his\r\nutterance, \"Would it had been shed for Ireland\", may and should be\r\ntrue, although he lived three days after the battle. Would, indeed,\r\nit had been shed for Ireland--after such a day!\r\n\r\nIt was in 1703 that the celebrated defence of Cremona lifted Irish\r\nrenown to great heights throughout Europe. There were but 600 Irish\r\ntroopers all told in that long day's work, and from the break of day\r\ntill nightfall they held at bay Prince Eugene's army of 10,000 men.\r\nThe two battalions of Bourke and Dillon were surprised at early morn\r\nto learn that the Austrians--and there were Irish officers among\r\nthem--were in the town. Major O'Mahony and his men ran from their\r\nbeds to the gates, and neither the foes without nor the foes within\r\ncould make them budge. Terribly they suffered under concentrated\r\nattacks, but a withering fire from the Irish met every assault. It\r\nwas nightfall before relief came, and then the sons of Ireland who\r\nhad held Cremona for the French were acclaimed by all, but of their\r\n600 they had lost nearly 350. Small wonder that the honor list that\r\nday was long. In Bourke's battalion the specially distinguished were\r\nCaptains Wauchop, Plunkett, Donnellan, MacAuliffe, Carrin, Power,\r\nNugent, and Ivers; in Dillon's, Major O'Mahony, Captains Dillon,\r\nLynch, MacDonough, and Magee, and Lieutenants Dillon and Gibbon, John\r\nBourke and Thomas Dillon. Major O'Mahony was sent to Paris to carry\r\nthe news of the victory to the king, who presented him with a purse\r\nof 1,000 louis d'or, a pension of 1,000 livres, and the brevet of\r\ncolonel.\r\n\r\nSo the history proceeds, the Irish regiments lost in the array of the\r\nFrench forces, but showing here and there a glint of charging\r\nbayonets, captured trenches, and gushes of Irish blood. In 1703 the\r\nbrigade regiments fought in Italy and Germany under the Duc de\r\nVendome. We hear of the regiments of Berwick, Bourke, Dillon, Galmoy,\r\nand Fitzgerald vigorously engaged. In Germany the story is of\r\nSheldon's Horse and two battalions of the regiments of Dorrington and\r\nClare. At the first battle of Blenheim, September 20, 1703, the\r\nregiment of Clare lost one of its colors, rallied, charged with the\r\nbayonet and recovered it, taking two colors from the enemy. This was\r\na French victory. Not so the great battle of Blenheim, August, 1704,\r\nwhen Marlborough and Prince Eugene severely defeated the French and\r\nBavarians. Three Irish battalions shared in the disaster. In 1705 at\r\nCassano in Italy an Irish regiment, finding itself badly galled by\r\nartillery fire from the opposite bank of the Adda, declared they\r\ncould stand it no longer, and thereupon jumped in, swam the river,\r\nand captured the battery. In 1705 Colonel O'Mahony of Cremona fame\r\ndistinguished himself in Spain. In the next year at the battle of\r\nRamillies, in which Marlborough with the Dutch defeated the French\r\nunder Villeroi, Lord Clare's regiment captured the colors of the\r\nEnglish Churchill regiment and of the Scottish regiment in the Dutch\r\nservice. In the same year and the next, the Irish Brigade fought many\r\nbattles in Spain. One cannot pursue the details of the engagements.\r\nRegiments ever decimated were ever recruited by the \"Wild Geese\" from\r\nIreland--the adventurous Catholic youth of the country who sought\r\ncongenial outlet for their love of adventure and glory. Many Irish\r\nalso joined the French army after deserting from the English forces\r\nin Flanders.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, at Fontenoy, May 11, 1745, that the Irish Brigade\r\nrendered their most signal service to France. The English under the\r\nDuke of Cumberland, son of George II., with 55,000 men including a\r\nlarge German and Dutch auxiliary, met the French under Marshal Saxe,\r\nand in the presence of the French king Louis XV., near Tournai in\r\nBelgium. Saxe had 40,000 men in action and 24,000 around Tournai,\r\nwhich town was the objective of the English advance. Among the troops\r\non the field were the six Irish regiments of Clare, Dillon, Bulkeley,\r\nRoth, Berwick, and Lally, all under Charles O'Brien, Viscount Clare,\r\nafterwards Marshal Thomond of France. After fierce cannonading on\r\nboth sides and a check to the allies on their right and left, a great\r\ncolumn of English veterans advanced on the French centre, breaking\r\nthrough with sheer force. They had thus reached high ground when some\r\ncannonading halted them. It was at this moment of gravest peril to\r\nthe French that the Irish regiments with unshotted guns charged\r\nheadlong up the slope on their ancient enemies, crying, \"Remember\r\nLimerick and British Faith!\" The great English column, already\r\nroughly handled by the cannon, broke and fled in wild disorder before\r\nthat irresistible onslaught, and France had won a priceless victory,\r\nbut the six Irish regiments lost one-third of their gallant men by a\r\nsingle volley as they followed their steel into the English lines.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Edward, the Stuart Pretender, landed in Scotland in\r\n1745, he was followed by a small French force, including 500 Irishmen\r\nfrom the Brigade. Colonel John O'Sullivan was much relied on by the\r\nprince in his extraordinary campaign. Sir Thomas Sheridan also\r\ndistinguished himself. There were 475 Irish at the battle of\r\nCulloden, that foredoomed defeat of the Stuart cause, and two days\r\nlater a score of Irish officers were among those who surrendered at\r\nInverness.\r\n\r\nIn Spain at the beginning of the 18th century there were hundreds of\r\nIrish officers in the military service, and eight Irish regiments.\r\nAmong the officers were thirteen Kellys, thirteen Burkes, and four\r\nSheas. It seemed that Ireland had soldiers for the world. Don\r\nPatricio, Don Miguel, Don Carlos, Don Tadeo took the place of\r\nPatrick, Michael, Charles, and Thadeus. O'Hart gives a list of sixty\r\ndescendants of the \"Wild Geese\" in places of honor in Spain. General\r\nPrim was a descendant of the Princes of Inisnage in Kilkenny. An\r\nO'Donnell was Duke of Tetuan and field marshal of Spain. Ambrose\r\nO'Higgins, born in county Meath, Ireland, was the foremost Spanish\r\nsoldier in Chile and Peru; Admiral Patricio Lynch was one of its most\r\ndistinguished sailors; and James McKenna its greatest military\r\nengineer. The son of O'Higgins was foremost among those who fought\r\nfor Chilean independence and gained it, and one of his ablest\r\nlieutenants was Colonel Charles Patrick O'Madden of Maryland.\r\n\r\nIn Austria the Irish soldiers were particularly welcome. They count\r\nforty-one field-marshals, major-generals, generals of cavalry, and\r\nmasters of ordnance of Irish birth in the Austrian service.\r\nO'Callaghan relates that on March 17, 1766, His Excellency Count\r\nMahony (son of the O'Mahony of Cremona), ambassador from Spain to the\r\ncourt of Vienna, gave a grand entertainment in honor of St. Patrick,\r\nto which he invited all persons of condition who were of Irish\r\ndescent. Among many others, there were present Count Lacy, President\r\nof the Council at War, the generals O'Donnell, McGuire, O'Kelly,\r\nBrowne, Plunkett, and MacElligot, four chiefs of the Grand Cross, two\r\ngovernors, several knights military, six staff officers, and four\r\nprivy councillors, with the principal officers of State. All wore\r\nPatrick's crosses in honor of the Irish nation, as did the whole\r\ncourt that day. Emperor Francis I. said: \"The more Irish officers in\r\nthe Austrian service the better; bravery will not be wanting; our\r\ntroops will always be well disciplined.\" The Austrian O'Reillys and\r\nTaaffes were famous. It was the dragoon regiment of Count O'Reilly\r\nthat by a splendid charge saved the remnant of the Austrian army at\r\nAusterlitz.\r\n\r\nIn the American war of the Revolution, General Charles Geoghegan of\r\nthe Irish Brigade made the campaigns of Rochambeau and Lafayette. He\r\nreceived the order of the Cincinnati from Washington and was ever\r\nproud of it. Lieutenant General O'Moran also served in America. He\r\nwas afterwards executed in the French Revolution, for the \"Brigade\"\r\nremained royalist to the end. General Arthur Dillon, who served in\r\nthe Brigade, was also guillotined in 1794, crying, \"_Vive le roi!_\"\r\nAt the foot of the scaffold a woman, probably Mme. Hébert, also\r\ncondemned, stood beside him. The executioner told her to mount the\r\nsteps. \"Oh, Monsieur Dillon,\" she said, \"pray go first.\" \"Anything to\r\noblige a lady,\" he answered gaily, and so faced his God.\r\n\r\nLord Macaulay, commenting upon these things and deploring the\r\npolicies that brought them about, says with great significance:\r\n\r\n\"There were Irish Catholics of great ability, but they were to be\r\nfound everywhere except in Ireland--at Versailles, at St. Ildefonso,\r\nin the armies of Frederic, in the armies of Maria Theresa. One exile\r\n(Lord Clare) became a marshal of France, another (General Wall)\r\nbecame Prime Minister of Spain.... Scattered all over Europe were to\r\nbe found brave Irish generals, dexterous Irish diplomatists, Irish\r\ncounts, Irish barons, Irish knights of St. Louis and St. Leopold, of\r\nthe White Eagle, and of the Golden Fleece, who if they remained in\r\nthe house of bondage, could not have been ensigns of marching\r\nregiments or freemen of petty corporations.\"\r\n\r\nThe old Irish brigades ended with the French monarchy. Battalions of\r\nthe regiments of Dillon and Walsh were with the French fleet in the\r\nWest Indies at Grenada and St. Eustache, also at Savannah, and under\r\nRochambeau at Yorktown, but, except as to the officers, the surviving\r\nregiments of Berwick, Dillon, and Walsh were largely French. With the\r\nbetter times under Grattan's Parliament in Ireland, the soldier\r\nemigration to France had all but ceased. The Irish Volunteers of 1782\r\nnumbered 100,000 men, of whom an appreciable proportion were\r\nCatholics. Many Irish went into the English army and navy, but there\r\nwas another stream of fighting emigrants, that which flocked to the\r\nstandard of revolt against England in America, of which much was to\r\nbe heard thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn the American colonies before the Revolution there were thousands\r\nof descendants of the Catholic Irish who had settled in Maryland and\r\nPennsylvania during the seventeenth century, as well as hardy Irish\r\nPresbyterians from Ulster, who came in great multitudes during the\r\nfirst half of the eighteenth century. They had suffered persecution\r\nin Ireland for conscience sake from their fellow-Protestants. In\r\nMaine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and the Carolinas\r\nthey constituted entire communities. The emigration of the Catholic\r\nor purely Celtic Irish to America in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies was often compulsory. At any rate, after the middle of the\r\neighteenth century it was large and became continuous--a true drift.\r\nCatholics and Presbyterians alike brought hostility to the English\r\ngovernment with them, and their voices fed the storm of discontent.\r\nThe Irish schoolmasters, of whom there were hundreds, were especially\r\nefficient in this. They came in every ship to the colonies. They had\r\nno love for England, for they had experienced in Ireland the tyranny\r\nof English law, and they would be more than human if they did not\r\nimbue the minds of the American children under their care with their\r\nown hatred of oppression and wrong and English domination. The log\r\nschoolhouse of the Irish teacher became the nursery of revolution.\r\nThey were a very important factor, therefore, in the making of the\r\nRevolution, and many of them took an active part as soldiers in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThe Irish, both Catholics and Protestants, poured into the patriot\r\nranks once the standard of revolt was raised in 1775. The\r\nPennsylvania line, which General Lee called \"the line of Ireland,\"\r\nwas almost entirely Irish, and the rosters of several of the Maryland\r\nand Virginia regiments contain a remarkably large proportion of Irish\r\nnames, in some cases running as high as 60 per cent. It is computed\r\nthat the Irish furnished not less than a third of the whole American\r\nforces. A common cause blotted out all old religious prejudices\r\nbetween Irishmen in the American service. It was John Sullivan, of\r\nNew Hampshire, son of a Limerick schoolmaster, who began the revolt\r\nby seizing the fort of William and Mary and its storehouses filled\r\nwith that powder which charged the guns at Bunker Hill in the\r\nfollowing year. It was Captain Jeremiah O'Brien, with his brothers,\r\nwho made the first sea attack on the British off Machias, Maine, in\r\nMay, 1775, an engagement which Fenimore Cooper calls \"the Lexington\r\nof the Seas.\" There were fifteen Celtic Irish names among the Minute\r\nMen at the Battle of Lexington. Colonel Barrett, who commanded at\r\nConcord, was Irish. There were 258 Celtic Irish names on the rosters\r\nof the American forces at the battle of Bunker Hill. John Sullivan\r\nhad been made a major-general, thereafter to be a notable figure in\r\nthe war at Princeton, Trenton, Newport, and in his Indian campaign.\r\nThe Connecticut line was thick with Irish names. Around Washington\r\nhimself was a circle of brilliant Irishmen: Adjutant-General Edward\r\nHand leading his rifles, Stephen Moylan his dragoons, General Henry\r\nKnox and Colonel Proctor at the head of his artillery, John Dunlop\r\nhis body-guard, Andrew Lewis his brigadier-general, Ephraim Elaine\r\nhis quartermaster, all of Irish birth or ancestry. Commodore John\r\nBarry, born in Wexford in 1739 and bred to the sea, was a ship\r\ncaptain in his early twenties, trading from Philadelphia. When the\r\nContinental Congress met, he at once volunteered, and was given\r\ncommand of the _Lexington_, the first American ship to capture a\r\nBritish war vessel. Later, after gallant fighting on sea and land, he\r\nwas given command of the U.S. frigate _Alliance_, in which he crossed\r\nthe Atlantic to France, and fought and captured in a rattling battle\r\ntwo British warships, the _Atlanta_ and the _Trepasay_. He was the\r\nFather of the American navy, holding captain's certificate No. 1,\r\nsigned by Washington himself--the highest rank then issued.\r\n\r\nGeneral Richard Montgomery, the brave and able soldier who fell at\r\nQuebec as he charged the heights, was an Irishman. General George\r\nClinton, son of an Irishman, was a brigadier-general, governor of New\r\nYork and twice Vice-President of the United States. Fifty-seven\r\nofficers of New York regiments in the Revolution were Irish, and a\r\nlarge number of the officers in the Southern regiments of the line,\r\nas well as of the militia, were native Irish or of Irish descent. The\r\nrosters of the enlisted Irishmen of the New York regiments run into\r\nthe thousands. Hundreds of Irish soldiers suffered in the prison\r\nships of New York, the horrors of which served so conspicuously to\r\nstimulate American determination to carry the war to the only\r\nrightful conclusion. Washington always recognized America's debt to\r\nthe Irish. \"St. Patrick\" he made the watchword in the patriot lines\r\nthe night before the English evacuated Boston forever on the\r\nmemorable 17th of March, 1776. After the war he was made, with his\r\nown consent, an honorary member of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick.\r\nMajor-General Richard Butler and his four brothers, all officers, and\r\nBrigadier-Generals John Armstrong, William Irvine, William Thompson,\r\nJames Smith, and Griffith Rutherford all fought with distinction. All\r\nof these officers were Irish-born. It was in truth an Irish war, so\r\nfar as Irish sentiment and whole-hearted service could make it. The\r\nrecord of Irish soldiers' names alone would fill volumes.\r\n\r\nThe thirst of the Irish race for the glory of war is shown in the\r\nlarge enlistments in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, and\r\nsince, in the English army and navy. Grattan, in pleading for\r\nIreland, claimed that a large percentage of the British forces were\r\nIrish. Wolfe Tone avers that there were 210 Irishmen out of 220 in\r\nthe crew of a British frigate that overhauled his ship on its way to\r\nAmerica. Bonaparte had in his armies an Irish Legion that did good\r\nservice in Holland, Spain, Portugal, and Germany. Marshal Clarke,\r\nDuke of Feltre, French Minister of War in 1809, was Irish. Up and\r\ndown the Spanish Peninsula, Irish blood was shed in abundance in the\r\narmies of Wellington. Never was more brilliant fighting done than\r\nthat which stands to Irish credit from the lines of Torres Vedras to\r\nBadajos and Toulouse. Of the Waterloo campaign volumes have been\r\nwritten in praise of Irish valor. As Maxwell says in his _Tales of\r\nWaterloo_:--\"The victors of Marengo and Austerlitz reeled before the\r\ncharge of the Connaught Rangers.\" Wellington himself was Irish, as in\r\nthe later wars of England Lord Gough, Lord Wolseley, Lord Roberts,\r\nLord Kitchener, and General French came from Ireland. The Irish\r\nsoldiers in the English service by a pitiful irony of fate helped\r\nmaterially to fasten the chains of English domination on the peoples\r\nof India in a long series of wars.\r\n\r\nIn America, the War of 1812 once more gave opportunity to the\r\nFighting Race. The commanding figure of the war, which opened so\r\ninauspiciously for the United States, was General Andrew Jackson, the\r\nhero of the battle of New Orleans, and afterwards twice elected\r\nPresident of the United States. \"Old Hickory\", as he came to be\r\nlovingly called, was proud of his Irish father, and sympathized with\r\nthe national longings of the Irish people. He was a splendid soldier,\r\nand his defeat of the English general, Pakenham, on January 8, 1815,\r\nwhich meant the control of the mouths of the Mississippi, as well as\r\nsafeguarding the city of New Orleans, reflected the highest credit on\r\nhis skill and unflagging energy. The English had superior numbers,\r\nbetween 8,000 and 9,000 men, against a scant 6,000 under Jackson, and\r\ntheir force was made up of veterans of the European wars. In command\r\nof the left of his line Jackson placed the gallant general William\r\nCarroll, born in Philadelphia, but of Irish blood, who was afterwards\r\ntwice governor of Tennessee. The British general made the mistake of\r\ndespising the soldier value of his enemy, yet before evening of that\r\nday he saw his artillery silenced and his lines broken, as he died of\r\na wound on the field. The battle was actually fought after the\r\nsigning of the treaty of peace at Ghent; it annihilated British\r\npretensions in this part of the world, anyway.\r\n\r\nAfter Commodore Perry, the victor in the battle of Lake Erie, and\r\nhimself the son of an Irish mother, the northern naval glory of the\r\nWar of 1812 falls to Lieutenant Thomas MacDonough, of Irish descent,\r\nwhose victory on Lake Champlain over the British squadron was almost\r\nas important as Perry's. Admiral Charles L. Stewart (\"Old\r\nIronsides\"), who commanded the frigate _Constitution_ when she\r\ncaptured the _Cyane_ and the _Levant_, fighting them by moonlight,\r\nwas a great and renowned figure. His parents came from Ireland, and\r\nCharles Stewart Parnell's mother was the great sea-fighter's\r\ndaughter. Lieutenant Stephen Cassin commanded the _Ticonderoga_ and\r\nfought her well. Captain Johnston Blakely, who was born in Ireland,\r\ncaptured in the _Wasp_ of 18 guns the much larger British _Reindeer_\r\nof 20 guns and 175 men in a splendid fight, and later sank the\r\n_Avon_, an 18-gun brig. After capturing a great prize, which he sent\r\nto Savannah, he sailed for the Spanish main and was never heard of\r\nmore. Captain Boyle, in the privateer _Comet_ of Baltimore, fought\r\nthe _Hibernia_, of 18 guns, and later in the _Chasseur_, known as the\r\nphantom ship, so fast she sailed, took eighty prizes on the high\r\nseas. General A.E. Maccomb, who commanded victoriously at Plattsburg,\r\nwas of Irish descent, and Colonel Robert Carr, who distinguished\r\nhimself in the same campaign, was born in Ireland. Major George\r\nCroghan of Kentucky, the hero of Fort Stephenson, was the son of an\r\nIrish father who had been a soldier in the Revolution. Colonel Hugh\r\nBrady, of the 22nd Infantry, commanded at Niagara. He remained in the\r\narmy and fought in Mexico. William McRee, of Irish descent, was\r\nGeneral Browne's chief engineer in laying out the military works of\r\nthe American army at Niagara.\r\n\r\nLet it not be forgotten that in this memorable company brave Mrs.\r\nDoyle has a place. Her husband, Patrick Doyle, an Irish artilleryman,\r\nhad been taken prisoner by the British in the affair at Queenston and\r\nhad been refused a parole. Accordingly, when the guns were trained on\r\nthe English lines before Fort Niagara, Mary, emulating the example of\r\nher countrywoman, \"Molly\" Pitcher, at Monmouth, determined to take\r\nher husband's place, and, regardless of flying British balls, tended\r\na blacksmith's bellows all day, providing red-hot shot for the\r\nAmerican gun battery, and sending a prayer with every shot into the\r\nBritish lines.\r\n\r\nAfter the Queenston affair, it is well to note, the English doctrine\r\nof perpetual allegiance was abated. Twenty-three Irish-born men were\r\namong the captives of the English in that engagement. They were\r\nmanacled to be sent to Ireland to be tried for treason, not as\r\nenemies taken in the field. Winfield Scott, then lieutenant-colonel,\r\nwas also a prisoner with them. He protested loudly against this\r\ninfamous course. Upon his release he laid aside twenty-three British\r\nprisoners to be treated like the Irishmen, eye for eye and tooth for\r\ntooth. As a result, the Irish prisoners were exchanged.\r\n\r\nColonel John Allen, who fell at the head of the First Regiment of\r\nKentucky Riflemen at the battle of the river Raisin on January 21,\r\n1813, was one of the Irish Allens of Kentucky. His father and mother\r\nwere natives of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican War (1846-48) again showed Irish valor at the front. It\r\nwas not a great war, though brilliantly fought and rich in\r\nterritorial accessions. The campaigning comprised the work of two\r\nmain expeditions and a subsidiary movement in California. One column,\r\nunder General Zachary Taylor, penetrated northern Mexico and fought\r\nthe battles of Matamoras, Palo Alto, and Resaca de la Palma, in May,\r\n1846, with a force of 2,200 men; forced the evacuation of Monterey in\r\nSeptember, his army swelled to 5,000; and defeated Santa Anna at\r\nBuena Vista in February, 1847. General Winfield Scott, with a naval\r\nexpediton, attacked Vera Cruz from the sea in March, 1847, and took\r\nup the march, 13,000 strong, to Mexico City, fighting the battles of\r\nCerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec,\r\nand entered Mexico City on September 14. General James Shields, born\r\nin Tyrone, Ireland, in 1810, was in command with his brigade under\r\nScott. A brilliant soldier, he was severely wounded at Cerro Gordo\r\nand again at Chapultepec. He served as United States Senator after\r\nthe war and again took the field in the Civil War, his forces\r\ndefeating Stonewall Jackson at the first battle of Winchester in\r\n1862. The glamour of chivalry lights the name of Phil Kearney. Here\r\nwas a born soldier. He was a volunteer with the French in Algiers in\r\n1839-40. He also commanded under Scott with brilliant bravery, and\r\nwas brevetted major on the field for \"gallant and meritorious\r\nconduct\" at the battles of Contreras and Churubusco. In the French\r\nwar with Austria in 1859-60, Kearney fought with the French,\r\ndistinguishing himself at the decisive and bloody battle of\r\nSolferino. In the Civil War he was brigadier-general of New Jersey\r\ntroops in 1861 and major-general in 1863, taking distinguished part\r\nin the battles of the Peninsula and second Bull Run, and was killed\r\nwhile reconnoitring at Chantilly. General Stephen W. Kearney, with\r\nthe Army of the West, by dint of long marches, secured California\r\namong the fruits of the war. General Bennet Riley, born in Maryland\r\nof Irish ancestry, commanded a brigade at Contreras, making a\r\nwonderful charge, and also fought brilliantly at Cerro Gordo and\r\nChurubusco, and was brevetted brigadier-general. He attained the army\r\nrank in 1858. Major-General William O. Butler, under Zachary Taylor,\r\nwas one of the heroes of Monterey. Born in Kentucky, son of Percival\r\nButler of Kilkenny, who was one of the famous five Butler brothers of\r\nthe Revolutionary War whom Washington once toasted as \"The Butlers\r\nand their five sons,\" General Butler succeeded General Scott in\r\ncommand of the entire American army in Mexico in February, 1848.\r\nAnother of clear Irish descent who fought under Zachary Taylor was\r\nMajor-General George Croghan, whose father, born in Sligo, Ireland,\r\nhad fought in the Revolution. He himself took part, as we have seen,\r\nin the War of 1812, and now was at the front before Monterey. Once,\r\nwhen a Tennessee regiment wavered under a hot converging fire,\r\nCroghan rushed to the front and, taking off his hat, shouted, \"Men of\r\nTennessee, your fathers conquered with Jackson at New Orleans. Come,\r\nfollow me!\" and they followed in a successful assault. Major-General\r\nRobert Paterson, who was born at Strabane, Ireland, and was the son\r\nof a '98 man, saw service in 1812, and became major-general of\r\nmilitia in Pennsylvania, whence he went to the Mexican War. He also\r\nlived to serve in the War of the States.\r\n\r\nAmong Irish-named officers mentioned honorably in official despatches\r\nare Major Edward H. Fitzgerald, Major Patrick J. O'Brien; Captain\r\nCasey, chosen to lead the first storming party at Chapultepec;\r\nCaptains Hogan, Byrne, Kane, McElvin, McGill, Burke, Barny,\r\nO'Sullivan, McCarthy, McGarry, and McKeon. Captain Mayne Reid, the\r\nnovelist, a native of Ireland, was in the storming of Chapultepec.\r\nTheodore O'Hara, the poet, served with the Kentucky troops and was\r\nbrevetted major for gallantry at Contreras and Churubusco, while on\r\nthe staff of General Franklin Pierce (afterwards President of the\r\nUnited States). O'Hara's magnificent poem, \"The Bivouac of the Dead,\"\r\nhas made his name immortal. It was written on the occasion of the\r\ninterment at Frankfort, Ky., of the Kentucky dead of the Mexican War,\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n      \"Glory guards with solemn round\r\n      The bivouac of the dead.\"\r\n\r\nIrwin C. McDowell, who was brevetted captain at Buena Vista,\r\ncommanded a corps in the Civil War. George A. McCall, brevetted\r\nlieutenant-colonel at Palo Alto, was a major-general in the Civil\r\nWar. Francis T. Bryan was a hero of Buena Vista. Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nThomas P. Moore and Captain James Hogan both won fame in the 3rd\r\nDragoons. Lieutenant Thomas Claiborn of the Mounted Rifles became a\r\ncolonel in the Confederate Army. Lieutenant-Colonel J.W. Geary fought\r\nbrilliantly and was to be heard from later with renown.\r\n\r\nColonel John F. Reynolds of the 3rd Artillery lived to be\r\nmajor-general in the Civil War, and to fall gloriously at Gettysburg.\r\nNor must we forget Major Folliot Lally's bravery at Cerro Gordo;\r\nSecond Lieutenant Thomas W. Sweeny, a brigadier-general of the Civil\r\nWar and the planner of the Fenian invasion of Canada in 1866;\r\nLieutenant Henry B. Kelly of the 2nd Infantry, afterwards a\r\nConfederate colonel; Captain Martin Burke of the 1st Artillery,\r\nkilled at Churubusco; nor Lieutenant William F. Barry of the 2nd\r\nArtillery, a brigadier-general in the Civil War. There were scores of\r\nother Irish named officers. In the whole American force of 30,000\r\nengaged, the Irish born and Irish descended troops of all arms were\r\nnumbered by thousands.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, in the Civil War that the flood of Irish valor and\r\nloyalty to the American Republic was at its height. The 2,800,000\r\nenlistments on the Northern side stood probably for 1,800,000\r\nindividual soldiers serving during the four years of the war. Not\r\nless than 40 per cent, of these were Irish born or of Irish descent.\r\nOf the 337,800 men furnished by the State of New York, 51,206 were\r\nnatives of Ireland out of the total of 134,178 foreign born, or 38\r\nper cent, of the latter, while not less than 80,000 of Irish descent\r\nfigured among the 203,600 native born soldiers. Of the 2,261\r\nengagements in the war, few there were that saw no Irishmen in arms,\r\nand certainly, in every one of the 519 engagements that made Virginia\r\na great graveyard, the Irish figured largely. Of the 1,000,516\r\nmustered out in 1865, not less than 150,000 were natives of Ireland,\r\nwhile those of Irish descent numbered hundreds of thousands. They\r\nfought well everywhere, and it would require volumes to give the\r\nnames and deeds of those who distinguished themselves more than their\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nOne name, however, shines with a great blaze above them all, the name\r\nof Philip H. Sheridan, one of the three supreme soldiers of the\r\nUnion, Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman being the\r\nothers. Had Ireland furnished only Sheridan to the Union cause, her\r\nservice would be beyond reward. He was born in Albany, N.Y., in\r\nMarch, 1831, the year after his parents, John and Mary Sheridan,\r\narrived there from the Co. Cavan, in Ireland. The family moved to\r\nSomerset, Perry Co., Ohio, the following year. There Philip began\r\nvillage life. How he gained the beginning of an education; worked in\r\na grocery store; became a bookkeeper; longed for a West Point\r\nnomination and got it; how he worked through the Academy in 1853;\r\nserved as lieutenant on the frontier, in Texas, California, and\r\nOregon, until the outbreak of the Civil War, when he was promoted\r\ncaptain and ordered east, can be quickly told. His history until the\r\nfall of the Confederacy would need many long chapters. His military\r\ngenius included all the requirements of a great captain, and his\r\nopportunties of exhibiting all his qualities in action came in rapid\r\nsuccession. In every service from quartermaster to army commander his\r\ntalents shone. His tremendous vigor, incredible mental alertness, and\r\ngenius for detail, added to his skill and outreach, continually set\r\nhim forward. He stood 5 feet 5 inches high, but somehow looked\r\ntaller, owing to his erect, splendid bearing. There was something in\r\nthe full chest, the thick muscular neck, the heavy head, the dark\r\nblazing eyes, and the quick bodily movements that arrested attention.\r\nHis name has come down to this generation mainly as a great cavalry\r\nleader, but he was a natural commander of all arms, a great\r\ntactician, a born strategist. His campaign of the Shenandoah Valley\r\nwas a whirlwind of success. His great battles around Richmond were\r\nwonderful. General Grant's opinion of Sheridan, given thirteen years\r\nafter the war, sums up the man. It is here quoted from J.R. Young's\r\nbook, _Around the World with General Grant_. It runs, in part, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"As a soldier, as a commander of troops, as a man capable of doing\r\nall that is possible with any number of men, there is no man living\r\ngreater than Sheridan. He belongs to the very first rank of soldiers,\r\nnot only of our country but of the world. I rank Sheridan with\r\nNapoleon and Frederick and the great commanders in history. No man\r\never had such a faculty of finding things out as Sheridan, of knowing\r\nall about the enemy. He was always the best informed of his command\r\nas to the enemy. Then he had that magnetic quality of swaying men,\r\nwhich I wish I had, a rare quality in a general. I don't think anyone\r\ncan give Sheridan too high praise.\"\r\n\r\nPraise from U.S. Grant is praise indeed. A peculiar feature of the\r\nCivil War was the growth of the generals: Grant, Sherman, Sheridan,\r\nThomas, Meade, all conspicuously experienced it. With Sheridan,\r\nhowever, one point is notable, namely, that He triumphed in every\r\nbranch in each successive extension of the field of his duties, and\r\nhe went from captain to major-general in three years of the regular\r\narmy. His care for his men was constant. His troops were always the\r\nbest fed, best clothed, best rested in the armies en either side, but\r\non no troops was there more constant call for endeavor, and they were\r\nnever found to fail him. In action he is described as severe,\r\nperemptory, dominating, but his determinations were mighty things,\r\nnot to be interfered with. He wanted things done and done at once.\r\nHis men of all grades soon conceded that he knew best what to do, and\r\nset about doing it accordingly. Out of action he was joyous of\r\nspirit, but, in fight or out of it, his alertness and his\r\nlightning-like decisions marked him apart from every other commander.\r\nHis career in the Tennessee campaign was meteoric. Of his score and\r\nmore of great conflicts, the most picturesque was his wonderful\r\nbattle at Cedar Creek, to fight which he rode at breakneck speed\r\n\"from Winchester twenty miles away\" through the dust and debris of a\r\nbroken army to the extreme front, rallying the scattered regiments\r\nand turning a defeat into a crushing victory, which recovered all\r\nthat had been lost, taking 25 cannon and 1,200 prisoners, and driving\r\nfor miles the lately victorious enemy under Early. Captain P.J.\r\nO'Keefe was one of the two who made the ride beside him. The battles\r\nof Waynesboro, Five Forks, and Sailor's Creek showed the same\r\nbrilliant generalship on the part of Sheridan. His hold on the\r\naffection of the army and the admiration of the people continued to\r\nthe day of his death, August 5, 1888, when he held the headship of\r\nthe United States army as general in succession to the great Sherman.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sheridan, towards the end of the war, had a soldier's\r\ndifference with Major-General George G. Meade, commander of the Army\r\nof the Potomac, but that did not blind \"Little Phil\" to the real\r\nmerit of the victor in the tremendous three days' battle of\r\nGettysburg, handling an army new to his hand against Robert E. Lee.\r\nThe Meade family is of Irish descent. George Meade, the grandfather,\r\ncame from Dublin and was a patriot in the American Revolutionary War.\r\nGeneral Meade commanded a division at Antietam and a corps at\r\nFredericksburg, and held command of the Army of the Potomac to the\r\nend of the war. He was a fine soldier and gentleman. Of quiet manners\r\nat most times, he was most irascible in the hour of battle, but his\r\ntemper did not becloud his judgment. General James Shields and\r\nGeneral Irwin McDowell, both fine Irish soldiers, have already been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to compass in a brief article even the names of the\r\ngeneral officers of Irish blood in the Civil War. General John Logan,\r\nwho fought with the western armies, is worthy of high and honorable\r\nmention, as is General Thomas Francis Meagher, a patriot in Ireland,\r\na prisoner in Australia, a soldier of dash in the Civil War.\r\nMeagher's Irish Brigade left a record of valor unsurpassed: their\r\ncharge at Fredericksburg up Marye's Heights alone should give them\r\nfull meed of fame. General Michael Corcoran, a native of Ireland,\r\ncommanded the wholly Irish 69th Regiment when it departed for the war\r\nin 1861, and after his exchange from a Confederate prison raised and\r\norganized the Corcoran Legion. Major-General McDowell McCook\r\ncommanded brilliantly in the western campaigns. Who has not heard of\r\nthe Fighting McCooks?--a family of splendid men and hardy warriors.\r\nBrigadier-General Thomas C. Devin was a superb cavalry commander, who\r\nled the first division of Sheridan's Shenandoah army through all its\r\ngreat operations. General James Mulligan of Illinois was of the true\r\nfighting breed. Colonel Timothy O'Meara led his superb Irish Legion\r\nfrom Illinois up Missionary Ridge. Brigadier-General C.C. Sullivan of\r\nwestern army fame was one of the five generals, headed by Rosecrans,\r\nwho recommended Phil Sheridan for promotion to brigadier-general\r\nafter the battle of Booneville as \"worth his weight in gold.\" General\r\nBrannan was a gallant division commander in the Middle Tennessee\r\ncampaign. Colonel William P. Carlin made a name at Stone River.\r\nGeneral James T. Boyle, of the Army of the Ohio under Buell, was the\r\nbrave man whose promotion to division commander left a vacancy for\r\n\"Little Phil\", that was to be an immediate stepping stone to higher\r\nopportunity. Brigadier-General McMillan, who commanded the second\r\nbrigide at Cedar Creek; Colonel Thomas W. Cahill, 9th Connecticut;\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Alfred Neafie of the 156th New York; Captain\r\nCharles McCarthy of the 175th New York; Lieutenant-Colonel Alex. J.\r\nKenny of the 8th Indiana; Lieutenant Terrence Reilly of the Horse\r\nArtillery, all won distinction in the Shenandoah Valley. Such\r\nsplendid fighters as General James R. O'Beirne, Colonel Guiney,\r\nColonel Cavanagh, Colonel John P. Byron, Colonel Patrick Gleason,\r\nGeneral Denis F. Burke, wrote their names red over a score of battle\r\nfields, but one cannot hope to cover more than a fraction of the\r\nbrilliant men of Irish blood who led and bled in the long, hard, and\r\nstrenuous struggle. The 69th New York Regiment was the mother of a\r\ndozen Irish regiments, including the Irish Brigade of Meagher and the\r\nCorcoran Legion. The 9th, 28th, and 29th regiments of Massachusetts\r\nwere all Irish. A gallant Irishman, born at Fermoy, was\r\nBrigadier-General Thomas Smyth, who made a name and died in the\r\nbattles around Richmond. There was not a regiment from the middle\r\nwestern and western States that did not hold its quota of Irishmen\r\nand sons of the Irish. After the names of Porter and Farragut in the\r\nNavy stands next highest in honor that of Vice-Admiral Stephen C.\r\nRowan, born in Dublin, of the famous family that produced Hamilton\r\nRowan, one of the foremost of the United Irishmen. It was the son of\r\nthe vice-admiral, a lieutenant in the army, who carried \"the message\r\nto Garcia\" from the United States War Department to the Cuban\r\ncommander in the eastern jungle of Cuba, before the outbreak of the\r\nwar with Spain, and did it so well and bravely through such\r\ndifficulties and dangers that his name will stand for \"the faithful\r\nmessenger\" forever.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of their stand with the American people in the Civil\r\nWar, the position of the whole mass of the Irish and Irish-American\r\npeople was vastly uplifted in American eyes. The unlettered poverty\r\nof scores of thousands of Irish immigrants, who came in multitudes\r\nfrom 1846 on, had made an unfavorable and false impression; their red\r\nblood on the battle field washed it out.\r\n\r\nOn the southern side as well, Irish valor shone. While the great\r\nflood of the mid-century Irish immigration had spread itself mainly\r\nnorth, east, and west, the larger cities of the South also received a\r\nshare. The slave system precluded the entry of free labor into the\r\ncotton, corn, lumber, and sugar lands of the South, but such cities\r\nas New Orleans, Mobile, Charleston, Savannah, Vicksburg, and Richmond\r\ngave varied employment to many of the Irish who made their homes in\r\nthe Southland, and so they came to furnish thousands of recruits to\r\nthe local Confederate levies. The \"Louisiana Tigers\", who fought so\r\nvaliantly at Gettysburg on the Southern side, included many Irish.\r\nThe Georgia brigade, that held the Confederate line atop of Marye's\r\nHeights at Fredericksburg, up which the Irish brigade so heroically\r\ncharged, had whole companies of Irish. There were scores of Irish in\r\nmany of the regiments that made Pickett's memorable charge at\r\nGettysburg. All through the Confederate armies were valiant\r\ndescendants of the earlier Irish immigration that settled the uplands\r\nof the Carolinas and Virginia and the blue grass region of Kentucky.\r\nMost famous, most glorious of these was \"Stonewall\"\r\nJackson--Lieutenant-General Thomas Jonathan Jackson--next to Robert\r\nE. Lee the greatest soldier on the southern side. No more splendid\r\nsoldier-figure rises out of the contest. Educated at West Point,\r\nserving in Mexico, then a professor of philosophy--and\r\nartillery--next a volunteer with his State when Virginia took arms\r\nagainst the Union, his long and brilliant service included a large\r\nshare in the victories at Bull Run, Gaines Mill, Malvern Hill, Cedar\r\nMountain, Harper's Ferry, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and\r\nChancellorsville, where he was accidentally wounded by his own men.\r\nHe was once defeated by General Shields, as has been noted. The piety\r\nand purity of his life belie the supposed necessity for the coarser\r\ntraits that are thought to go with the terrible trade. General\r\nPatrick R. Cleburne was born in 1828, near Cork, Ireland. He was in\r\nthe English army three years, and, coming to the United States,\r\nbecame a lawyer at Helena, Ark. He enlisted in the Confederate army\r\nas a private, rose rapidly to the command of a brigade, and made a\r\ngreat name at Shiloh. As major-general he led divisions at\r\nMurfreesboro and Chickamauga, and was thanked by the Confederate\r\nCongress. He fell at the battle of Franklin--a soldier of commanding\r\npresence, skill, and daring, beloved by the whole Army of the West.\r\nThe gallant colonel Thomas Claiborne was a striking cavalryman. It\r\nwas Lieutenant Thomas A. Claiborne of the 1st South Carolina who,\r\nwith Corporal B. Brannan, lashed the broken flagstaff on Fort Sumter\r\nin June, 1864, when, under a withering fire, the flag of the\r\nConfederacy had been shot away. The fighting of Major-General Gary of\r\nSouth Carolina around Richmond was desperate. He was the last to\r\nleave the city when it fell, as told by Captain Sullivan: \"He\r\ngalloped at night through the burning city, and at the bridge over\r\nthe James cried out, 'We are the rear guard. It is all over; blow the\r\nbridge to h--l!' and went on into the night\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the Civil War is a mine of honor to the Irish, and\r\nIrishmen should set it forth at length. Here it can be merely glanced\r\nat.\r\n\r\nThe war of 1898 with Spain--that great patriotic efflorescence--was\r\nbrief in its campaigning. Immediately provoked by the blowing up of\r\nthe U.S.S. _Maine_ in Havana harbor on February 15, war was declared\r\non April 19. Admiral Dewey sank the Spanish fleet in Manila Harbor,\r\nMay 1. The first troops landed on Cuban soil June 1. The first--and\r\nlast--real land battle before Santiago occurred on July 1-2, with\r\n13,500 troops on the American side against an available Spanish force\r\nsomewhat less in number, but holding strongly fortified and\r\nentrenched positions around the town. The advance and charges uphill\r\nnecessary to capture El Caney and the steep heights of San Juan\r\ncalled for desperate courage. It was there, however, and the Irish in\r\nthe army exhibited dash and persistence, as duty demanded. In the\r\nsecond day's fighting the Spanish assaults on the American positions\r\nwere repelled, and the land fighting was over. The Americans in the\r\ntwo days lost over 10 per cent killed and wounded. The destruction of\r\nCervera's fleet on its attempt to escape from Santiago on July 3\r\nended the struggle. With the regiment of Rough Riders, under Theodore\r\nRoosevelt--who says he reckons \"an O'Brien, a Redmond, and a man from\r\nUlster\" among his for-bears--were many gallant Irishmen--Kellys,\r\nMurphys, Burkes, and Doyles, for instance. His favorite captain,\r\n\"Bucky\" O'Neill of Arizona, fell at the foot of San Juan. The white\r\nregiments of the regular army had their quota of Irish, as had most\r\nof the volunteers. The 9th Massachusetts was all Irish. The 69th New\r\nYork, all Irish, never reached the front in the war, but shared the\r\nfate of the 150,000 troops cantoned through the Southern States,\r\ntheir only effective enemies being dysentery, typhoid, and malaria.\r\n\r\nA little splash of Irish blood came with the Fenian dash into Canada\r\non June 1, 1866. There had been active preparations for a real\r\ninvasion by some 50,000 Irish-born or Irish-fathered soldiers who had\r\nserved in the Civil War. The American government, using its army\r\nforce, intervened to prevent the bellicose movement, not, however,\r\nbefore Colonel John O'Neill, who had served in the cavalry with\r\nSherman on his march to the sea, with Captain Starr, one of\r\nKilpatrick's cavalry, Captain O'Brien, and about 700 well-armed men,\r\nall Civil War veterans, had slipped across the Niagara River at Fort\r\nErie. They made short work of all in sight, threw out a couple of\r\nhundred men who burned a bridge and tore up the railroad tracks.\r\nTheir scouts fired on a small British detachment, which ran. On the\r\nmorning of June 2 news came of a larger Canadian force advancing, and\r\nO'Neill went out to meet them. Deploying his men in a field near the\r\nhigh road at a place called Ridgway, he sent his pickets forward.\r\nThey found heavy ground in front and about three-quarters of a mile\r\naway some 1,400 men of the \"Queen's Own\" of Toronto and the Hamilton\r\nVolunteers advancing rapidly in line. O'Neill, after a few rounds,\r\nwithdrew his pickets, and the Canadians, taking the movement for\r\nflight, came briskly on. As soon as they were clear of cover,\r\nO'Neill, firing a volley, gave orders for a charge. At it they went\r\nwith a cheer, and the whole Canadian line gave way. They ran as fast\r\nas their legs could carry them, leaving some fifty killed and\r\nwounded. After chasing them for two miles, O'Neill halted his men and\r\nbrought them back to Fort Erie, where they intrenched. The Canadians\r\ndid not stop until they reached Colburne, eighteen miles away. The\r\nFenian loss was twenty-five. In the night O'Neill learned that no\r\nhelp was coming from the United States' side, while news reached him\r\nthat a force of 5,000 Canadian and British regulars was advancing on\r\nFort Erie. Accordingly, at 2 a.m. on June 3, he surrendered to the\r\nUnited States forces with 400 of his men, who were detained for a few\r\ndays on the U.S.S. _Michigan_ and then let go. The balance of his\r\nforce, about 250 men, escaped in groups across the river. There was\r\nanother little victorious skirmish with the Canadians lower down\r\nunder Captain Spear, who also slipped back over the border unpursued.\r\nWhat fighting took place was workmanlike and creditable.\r\n\r\nThere was a flicker of Irish fighting spirit in the Boer War. Many\r\nthousands, no doubt, were in the English army of 250,000 men brought\r\nagainst the 30,000 Boers, but there was a small \"Irish Brigade\" that\r\nfought on the Boer side, and was notably engaged at Spion Kop, where\r\nthe English were driven so sweepingly from their position by\r\ndesperate charges.\r\n\r\nIn the War of 1870, between France and Prussia, the good wishes of\r\nthe Irish went with France, for the sake of the old friendship,\r\nlargely helped, no doubt, by the fact that at the summit of army\r\ncommand was Marshal MacMahon, a descendant of a warrior of the old\r\nIrish Brigade. His service in Algiers; his skill and daring in the\r\nCrimean War before Sebastopol, where he led the division which\r\nstormed the Malakoff; his victories in the Italian War of 1859\r\nagainst Austria, including the great battle of Magenta, all made him\r\na striking, romantic figure. He failed in 1870 against the Prussians\r\nat Worth, and was made prisoner with his army at Sedan, but he\r\nsuppressed the Commune after the war and was President of France from\r\n1873 to 1879. The device by which 300 Irishmen took part on the\r\nFrench side in the war with Germany has a grim humor. They went as\r\naides in an ambulance corps fitted out in Dublin by subscription,\r\nbut, once on French soil, enlisted in the army. \"Maybe we can kill as\r\nwell as we can cure,\" said one of them. The _Compagnie irlandaise_,\r\nas it was called, did creditable work, and was in the last combat\r\nwith the Prussians at Montbellard. Their captain, M.W. Kirwan, was\r\noffered a Cross of the Legion of Honor, but for some reason declined\r\nit. Dr. Constantine J. McGuire, who won the decoration for bravery\r\nbefore Paris during the siege of the Commune, did, however, accept\r\nit, receiving the cross from the hands of Marshal MacMahon, and, hale\r\nand hearty, wears the red ribbon on occasion in New York today.\r\n\r\nEven as this chronicle of daring deeds and daring doers is being\r\npenned, in the ranks and as commanding officers on the side of the\r\nallies in the far-flung battle lines of the great European war, are\r\nmen of Irish birth, and, let it not be forgotten, not a few of the\r\nopposing side are the descendants of the Irish military geniuses who,\r\nin days gone by, fought so gallantly across the continent \"from\r\nDunkirk to Belgrade\". They are all, every man of them, bearing\r\nbravely, as of yore, their own part amid the dangers and chances of\r\nthe fray.\r\n\r\nIf the inspiring story is of necessity here barely sketched in\r\noutline, it nevertheless clearly indicates that, as it has been for\r\ntwo thousand years of Irish history, so it will be to the end of the\r\nhuman chapter--the Irish race is the Fighting Race, and willing, even\r\neager, to risk life itself for vital issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nKeating's, MacGeoghegan's, Mitchel's Histories of Ireland; J.C.\r\nO'Callaghan: The Irish Brigades in the Service of France, The Green\r\nBook; Lossing: Field Book of the Revolution, Field Book of the War of\r\n1812; Several Mexican War Histories; Battles and Leaders of the Civil\r\nWar; The Irish at Home and Abroad (New York, 1856); Canon O'Hanlon:\r\nIrish-American History of the United States; O'Hart; Irish Pedigrees;\r\nMartin I.

What a vision of woe the words conjure up.\r\nThe late Goldwin Smith, himself an Englishman and a Unionist, in his\r\n_Irish History and the Irish Question_, finds that \"of all histories,\r\nthe history of Ireland is the saddest. For nearly seven centuries it\r\nwas a course of strife between races, bloodshed, massacre,\r\nmisgovernment, civil war, oppression, and misery.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of the great scourges of Erin was the coming of the Danes,\r\nthe bloodthirsty and conquest-loving Vikings of the North, the\r\nworshipers of Thor and Odin, the gods of thunder and of strife. These\r\nwarriors, in never-ending invasions, had for four hundred years\r\noverrun Britain and finally conquered the northern provinces of Gaul.\r\nUntil the end of the eighth century Ireland had been free from the\r\nScandinavian scourge. About this time the invaders made lodgments\r\nalong the caasts, passed inward through the island, burned and looted\r\nreligious houses and schools of learning, levied tribute upon the\r\ninhabitants, and at length established themselves firmly at Limerick,\r\nWaterford, Dublin, Wexford, and Carlingford. Fortified towns were\r\nbuilt, trading communications with Britain and the continent were set\r\nup, and the Northman, though not in actual possession of the interior\r\nof the island, was apparently in substantial control of its\r\ndestinies. Brian Borumha, or Boru, brother of the king of Munster, of\r\nthe Dalcassian race of O'Brien, refused to submit, roused his\r\nbrother, fought the Danes of Limerick at Sulchoid (A.D. 968), and\r\ncaptured Limerick. Brian later succeeded his brother, became\r\nsovereign of all Ireland (A.D. 1001), and, on Good Friday, A.D.\r\n1014, joined battle with the Danes upon the famous field of Clontarf.\r\nHere the power of the Northmen was forever broken, Brian falling at\r\nthe moment of victory, while in his tent, by the hand of a fugitive\r\nDane.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Brian the united government dissolved. The\r\nprovincial kings, or princes, resumed separate authority and a\r\nstruggle arose among them, with varying success, for the national\r\nsovereignty. The central government never had been strong, as the\r\nnation was organized on a tribal or family basis. In this weakened\r\ncondition Dermot MacMurrough, king of Leinster, abducted the wife of\r\nO'Rourke, prince of Breffni, while the latter was on a pilgrimage.\r\nMacMurrough was compelled to fly to England. He sought the protection\r\nof the Angevin English king, Henry Plantagenet. As a result of this\r\nappeal, a small expedition, headed by Strongbow (A.D. 1169), was sent\r\nto Ireland, and Waterford, Wexford, and Dublin were taken. Then came\r\nHenry himself, in 1171, with a fleet of 240 ships, 400 knights, and\r\n4,000 men, landing at Waterford. This expedition was the beginning of\r\nthe English attempted conquest of Ireland--a proceeding that, through\r\nall the ruin and bloodshed of 800 years, is not yet accomplished.\r\nHenry's first act was to introduce the feudal system into that\r\nsouthern half of the island which he controlled; he seized great\r\ntracts of land, which he in turn granted to his followers under\r\nfeudal customs; he introduced the offices of the English feudal\r\nsystem and the English laws, and placed his followers in all the\r\npositions of power, holding their lands and authority under the\r\nfeudal conditions of rendering him homage and military service.\r\n\r\nThis was the root of the alien \"landlordism\" and foreign political\r\ncontrol of future times which became the chief curses of Ireland, the\r\nprolific source of innumerable woes. The succeeding years till the\r\nreign of Henry VIII. witnessed the extension, and at times the\r\ndecline, of the Anglo-Norman rule. When Henry VII. became king of\r\nEngland the Anglo-Norman colony or \"Pale\" had shrunk to two counties\r\nand a half around Dublin, defended by a ditch. Many of the original\r\nNorman knights had become \"more Irish than the Irish themselves.\"\r\nSuch was the great family of the Geraldines or Fitzgerald--the most\r\npowerful, with the O'Neills of the North, in Ireland. A united attack\r\nat this time would most certainly have driven out the invader; for it\r\nmust be remembered that Dublin, the \"Pale\"--\"the Castle government\"\r\nof later times--was the citadel of the English foreign power, and\r\nbefore a united nation would most certainly have succumbed.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry VIII. ascended the throne of England, the policy of peace\r\nin Ireland was continued during the early portion of his reign. Then\r\ncame Henry's break with the Pope over the royal divorce. The Irish\r\nbeyond the Pale, and many within it, were loyal to the Church of\r\ntheir fathers, to the faith of Patrick, the faith of the Roman See.\r\nTo Henry and his daughter Elizabeth, the daughter of Anne Boleyn, who\r\ndisplaced Henry's lawful wife, this was treason. Henceforth, to the\r\nbitterness of race hatred and the pride of the conqueror were to be\r\nadded the blackest of religious feuds, the most cruel of religious\r\npersecutions in the history of the world. Again let Goldwin Smith,\r\nthe English Unionist, describe the result: \"Of all the wars waged by\r\na civilized on a barbarous _(sic)_ and despised race these wars waged\r\nby the English on the Irish seem to have been the most hideous. No\r\nquarter was given by the invader to man, woman, or child. The\r\nbutchering of women and children is repeatedly and brutally avowed.\r\nNothing can be more horrible than the cool satisfaction with which\r\nEnglish commanders report their massacres.\" Famine was deliberately\r\nadded to the other horrors. What was called law was more cruel than\r\nwar: it was death without the opportunity for defense and with the\r\nhypocrisy of the forms of justice added.\r\n\r\nOut of this situation came the infamous Penal Code, which, by the\r\nperiod of William the Third, about 1692, became a finished system.\r\nThis is the \"Irish Code\" of which Lord Brougham said: \"It was so\r\ningeniously contrived that an Irish Catholic could not lift his hand\r\nwithout breaking it.\" And Edmund Burke said: \"The wit of man never\r\ndevised a machine to disgrace a realm or destroy a kingdom so perfect\r\nas this.\" Montesquieu, the great French jurist-philosopher, the\r\nauthor of the epoch-making _Spirit of the Laws_, commented: \"It must\r\nhave been contrived by devils; it ought to have been written in\r\nblood; and the only place to register it is in hell.\" Yet for two\r\nhundred years this code of death, national and individual, was the\r\nsupreme law of Ireland.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips, the great American orator, in his lecture on\r\n\"Daniel O'Connell,\" summed up this Penal Code in words that will not\r\nsoon be forgotten by the world. His reference to Mr. Froude is to\r\nJames Anthony Froude, the English historian. He says:\r\n\r\n\"You know that, under it, an Irish Catholic could not sit in the\r\nHouse of Commons; he could not hold any commission from the Crown,\r\neither civil or military; he could be a common soldier--nothing more.\r\nHe could neither vote, nor sit on a jury, nor stand on a witness\r\nstand, nor bring a suit, nor be a doctor, nor be a lawyer, nor travel\r\nfive miles from his own home without a permit from a justice of the\r\npeace. The nearest approach that ever was made to him was a South\r\nCarolina negro before the war. He had no rights that a Protestant\r\nneeded to respect. If he was a land-holder, if all his children were\r\nCatholics, he was obliged to divide the land equally between them.\r\nThis was the English plan for eliminating the Catholic tenure of the\r\nland and letting it slip out of their hands. Then, if any of the\r\nchildren, during their father's life, concluded to become\r\nProtestants, in such case they took the whole estate; or, indeed,\r\nthey might compel the father to put his estate in trust for their\r\nbenefit. So, if the Catholic wife would not go to an Episcopalian\r\nchurch once a month--which she deemed it a sin to do--she forfeited\r\nher dower. But if she went regularly, she could have all the estate.\r\nIf a Catholic had a lease, and it rose one-quarter in value, any\r\nProtestant could take it from him by bringing that fact to the notice\r\nof a justice of the peace. Three justices of the peace might summon\r\nany Catholic before them, and oblige him to give up his faith, or\r\nquit the realm. Four justices could oblige him to abjure his faith or\r\nsell his estates. If a Protestant paid one dollar tax, the Catholic\r\npaid two. If a Protestant lost a ship, when at war with a Catholic\r\npower--and at the time there was only _one_ Protestant power in\r\nEurope, besides Great Britain; that was Holland: so that the chances\r\nwere nine to one that, in case of war, Great Britain would be at war\r\nwith a Catholic power--in such a case, if a Protestant lost a ship,\r\nhe went home and assessed the value on his Catholic neighbors, and\r\nwas reimbursed. So, of education. We fret a great deal on account of\r\na class of Irishmen who come to our shores and are lacking in\r\neducation, in culture, and refinement. But you must remember the bad\r\nlaws, you must remember the malignant legislation, that sentenced\r\nthem to a life of ignorance, and made education a felony in Catholic\r\nIreland. If an Irishman sent his child to a Protestant schoolmaster,\r\nall right; but if the parent would not do so, and sent him to a\r\nCatholic school, the father was fined ten pounds a week; and the\r\nschoolmaster was fined five pounds a week; and for the third offense\r\nhe was hung! But, if the father determined that his child should be\r\neducated, and sent him across the Channel to France, the boy\r\nforfeited his citizenship and became an alien; and, if discovered,\r\nthe father was fined one hundred pounds; and anybody, except the\r\nfather, who harbored him, forfeited all civil rights--that is, he\r\ncould not sue in a court of law, nor could he vote. Indeed, a\r\nCatholic could not marry! If he married a Protestant, the marriage\r\nwas void; the children were illegitimate. And, if one Catholic\r\nmarried another, it required the presence of a priest, and if a\r\npriest landed in Ireland for twenty minutes, it was death! To this\r\nferocious 'Code', Sir Robert Peel, in our own day, added the climax,\r\nthat no Catholic should quit his dwelling between the hours of sunset\r\nand sunrise, an exaggeration of the 'Curfew Law' of William the\r\nConqueror. Now, you will hardly believe that this was enacted as a\r\nlaw. But Mr. Froude alludes to this code. Yes; he was very honest; he\r\nwould paint England as black as she deserved. He said of Queen\r\nElizabeth that she failed in her duty as a magistrate; she failed\r\ntowards Ireland in her capability of being a great ruler. And then he\r\nproceeded, after passing sentence, to give us the history of her\r\nreign, and showed that, in very many cases, she could not have done\r\nany different. For instance--oh! it is the saddest, blackest, most\r\nhorrible statement of all history; it makes you doubt the very\r\npossibility of human nature--when you read that Spenser, the poet,\r\nwho had the most ardent, most perfect ideas in English\r\npoetry--Spenser sat at the council board that ordered the wholesale\r\nbutchery of a Spanish regiment captured in Ireland, and, to execute\r\nthe order, he chose Sir Walter Raleigh, the scholar, the gentleman,\r\nthe poet, the author, and the most splendid Englishman of his age!\r\nAnd Norris, a captain under Sidney, in whose veins flowed the blood\r\nof Sir Philip, writing home to Elizabeth, begs and persuades her to\r\nbelieve in O'Neill's crimes, and asks for leave to send a hired man\r\nto poison him! And the Virgin Queen makes no objection! Mr. Froude\r\nquotes a letter from Captain Norris, in which he states that he found\r\nhimself in an island where five hundred Irish (all women and\r\nchildren; not a man among them) had taken refuge from the war; and he\r\ndeliberately butchered every living soul! And Queen Elizabeth, in a\r\nletter still extant, answers by saying: 'Tell my good servant that I\r\nwill not forget his good services.' He tells us that 'The English\r\nnobility and gentry would take a gun as unhesitatingly as a fowler,\r\nand go out to shoot an Irishman as an Indian would a buffalo.' Then\r\nhe tells us, with amazement, that you never could make an Irishman\r\nrespect an Englishman! He points to some unhappy Kildare, the sole\r\nrelic of a noble house, whose four uncles were slaughtered in cold\r\nblood--that is the only word for this kind of execution,\r\n_slaughtered_--and he, left alone, a boy, grows up characterless and\r\nkills an archbishop. Every impetuous, impatient act is dragged before\r\nthe prejudiced mind. But when Mr. Froude is painting Sir Walter and\r\nSpenser, blind no longer, he says: 'I regret--it is very sad to\r\nthink--that such things should ever have been!'\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the cup from which Ireland drank even into the days of men\r\nnow living. Nor was this all. The rise of English manufactures\r\nbrought a new chapter of woes to Ireland. The Irish cattle trade had\r\nbeen killed by an Act of Charles II. for the benefit of English\r\nfarmers. The Irish then took up the raising of wool and woolen\r\nmanufactures. A flourishing trade grew up. An English law destroyed\r\nit. In succession the same greed killed the cotton, the glovemaking,\r\nthe glassmaking, and the brewing trades. These were reserved for the\r\nEnglish maker and merchant. These crimes upon Irish industry\r\nsurpassed a thousand-fold the later English attempts upon the\r\nindustries of the American colonies.\r\n\r\nUnder the Code, and through the extreme poverty produced thereby,\r\nsubstantially all the land of Ireland passed out of the hands of the\r\npeople. They became mere serfs upon the soil. Their tribute was paid\r\nthrough a rapacious agent to a foreign landlord. The improvement of\r\nthe land by the labor of the tenant brought increase of rent. There\r\nwas no fixity of tenure of the land. It was held at the will of the\r\nagent, reflecting the rapacity of the non-resident landlord. Upon\r\nthese holdings the principal crop was the potato. A failure of this\r\ncrop was a failure to pay rent, eviction on the roadside, and\r\nstarvation. The results, after the enactment of the Penal Code, and\r\nduring the greater part of the eighteenth century, are thus described\r\nby Goldwin Smith: \"On such a scene of misery as the abodes of the\r\nIrish cotters the sun has rarely looked down. Their homes were the\r\nmost miserable hovels, chimneyless, filthy. Of decent clothing they\r\nwere destitute. Their food was the potato; sometimes they bled their\r\ncattle and mixed the blood with sorrel. The old and sick were\r\neverywhere dying by cold and hunger, and rotting amidst filth and\r\nvermin. When the potato failed, as it often did, came famine, with\r\ndisease in its train. Want and misery were in every face, the roads\r\nwere spread with dead and dying, there was sometimes none to bear the\r\ndead to the grave, and they were buried in the fields and ditches\r\nwhere they perished. Fluxes and malignant fevers followed, laying\r\nthese villages waste. 'I have seen,' says a contemporaneous witness,\r\n'the laborer endeavoring to work at his spade, but fainting for want\r\nof food and forced to quit it. I have seen the helpless orphan\r\nexposed on the dunghill, and none to take him in for fear of\r\ninfection. And I have seen the hungry infant sucking at the breast of\r\nthe already expired parent.'\"\r\n\r\nAll these are not only the horrors of a hundred or two hundred years\r\nago; they were repeated in ten thousand forms in the awful famine\r\ndays of 1847. In 1841 the population of Ireland was 8,796,545\r\npersons. In 1851, after four years of famine, the population was\r\n6,551,970, leaving 2,244,575 persons to be accounted for, and taking\r\nno account of the natural increase of the population during the ten\r\nyears. Not less than a million and a half of these died of starvation\r\nand the fevers brought on by famine. The remainder emigrated to\r\nforeign lands.\r\n\r\nIn this account of the Sorrows of Ireland nothing has been said of\r\nthe vast emigrations, thousands upon thousands of persons in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries leaving Ireland under forced\r\ndeportations, in a practical selling into slavery. The sum total of\r\nthis loss to Ireland cannot be less than 5,000,000 souls. The earlier\r\ndeportations were carried out under the most atrocious circumstances.\r\nFamilies were broken up and scattered to distant and separate\r\ncolonies, such as Barbados, the New England States, and later to the\r\nSouth Pacific.\r\n\r\nThis is but a glance at some of the wrongs to Ireland's religious,\r\nintellectual, and material welfare, wrongs that have plunged her into\r\nan age-long poverty. But one of the greatest of all her sorrows has\r\nbeen the denial of her national life, the attempt to strangle her\r\nrightful aspirations as a free people. Her autonomy was taken from\r\nher; her smallest legislative act was the act of a stranger; in fine,\r\nevery mark of political slavery was put upon her. A foreign soldiery\r\nwas, and still is, quartered upon her soil. The control of her\r\nrevenues, of the system of taxation, was wrested from her. These\r\nbecame the function of a hateful resident oligarchy, alien in\r\neverything to the Irish people, and of the English parliament, to\r\nwhich she was not admitted until the days of Daniel O'Connell. And\r\nthen she was admitted only through fear of revolution.\r\n\r\nThe dawn has come. The dark night is almost past; the heroic struggle\r\nof Ireland is about to close in triumph. Her loyalty to her ideals of\r\nfreedom and religion is to meet its reward. The epitaph of Robert\r\nEmmet will soon be written, for at last Ireland is certain of \"taking\r\nher place among the nations of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nD'Alton: History of Ireland; J.P.

Their short\r\nand strenuous careers have burnt out in their prime, and their ends\r\nhave been such as attend conflagrations. More often they have left a\r\npall than a light in the heavens, for the most brilliant lives in\r\nIrish history have led to the most tragic deaths. The Destiny which\r\nallotted them impossible tasks has given them immortality on the\r\nscenes of their glorious failure.\r\n\r\nThey differ from leaders of other countries, who divide the average\r\npittances of success or ill success on the road to honored\r\nretirement. Few of the heroes among modern nations have left such\r\nvivid and lasting memory as \"the strong men of Ireland.\" During the\r\nnineteenth century their lore and cult have traversed the whole world\r\nin the wake of the great emigrations. Whether they failed or\r\nsucceeded in wresting the independence and ideals of Ireland for a\r\nwhile from the fell clutch of circumstance, they live with their race\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nUnder Plantagenet and Tudor rule, the Irish leaders presented a\r\nsullen but armed resistance. A never completed invasion was met by\r\nsporadic raids and successive risings. A race of military outlaws was\r\nfashioned, which accounts for much in Irish character today.\r\nPreviously the Irish, like all Celtic civilization, was founded on\r\nthe arts, on speech, and on law, rather than on war and feudalism.\r\n\r\nEven Irish militancy was crushed in the Williamite wars, and the\r\nrace, deprived of its original subsistence as well as of its acquired\r\ndefense, sank into the stupor of penal times. Those who should have\r\nbeen leaders of Ireland became marshals of Austria and France.\r\n\r\nGradually it was learnt that the pen is mightier than the sword and\r\nthe human voice more potent than the sound of cannon--and the\r\nconstitutional struggle developed, not without relapse and reverse.\r\nTo Dean Swift must be attributed the change in the national weapon\r\nand the initiation of a leadership of resistance within the law,\r\nwhich has lasted into modern times. Accident made Swift an Irishman,\r\nand a chance attempt to circulate debased coins in Ireland for the\r\nbenefit of a debased but royal favorite made him a patriot. Swift\r\ndrove out Wood's halfpence at the pen-point. He shamed the\r\ngovernment, he checked the all-powerful Walpole, and he roused the\r\nmanhood of Ireland towards independence in legislation. He never\r\nrealized what a position history would give him. To himself he seemed\r\na gloomy failure, to his contemporaries a popular pamphleteer, but to\r\nposterity he is the creator of public conscience in Ireland. He was\r\nthe father of patriotic journalism, and the first to defend Ireland's\r\nrights through literature. Though his popularity was quenched in\r\nlunacy, his impress upon Irish politics remains as powerful and\r\nlasting as upon English literature.\r\n\r\nWithin the so-called Irish parliament sprang forth the first of a\r\nlong line of orators, Henry Flood. He was the first to study the\r\nConstitution for purposes of opposition. He attacked vice-regal\r\ngovernment in its own audit-house. Pension and corruption he laid\r\nbare, and upon the people he breathed a spirit of independence.\r\nUnfortunately he was not content with personal prominence. He\r\naccepted office, hoping thereby to benefit Ireland. His voice became\r\nlost to the higher cause, and another man rose in his stead, Henry\r\nGrattan. The American war tested the rival champions of Liberty.\r\nFlood favored sending Irish troops, \"armed negotiators\" he called\r\nthem, to deal with the revolted colonists. Grattan nobly reviled him\r\nfor standing--\"with a metaphor in his mouth and a bribe in his\r\npocket, a champion against the rights of America, the only hope of\r\nIreland and the only refuge of the liberties of mankind.\" Flood\r\ncollapsed under his ignoble honors. He was not restored by returning\r\nto patriotic opposition. Grattan's leadership proved permanent\r\npolitically and historically. His name connotes the high water-mark\r\nof Irish statesmanship. The parliament which he created and whose\r\nrights he defined became a standard, and his name a talisman and a\r\nchallenge to succeeding generations. The comparative oratory of\r\nGrattan and Flood is still debated. Both after a manner were unique\r\nand unsurpassed. Flood possessed staying power in sheer invective and\r\nsustained reasoning. Grattan was fluent in epigram and most inspiring\r\nwhen condensed, and he had an immense moral advantage. The parliament\r\nwhich made him a grant was independent, but it was from one of\r\nsubservience that Flood drew his salary. Henceforth Grattan was\r\nhaunted by the jealous and discredited herald of himself. A great\r\ngenius, Flood lacked the keen judgment and careless magnanimity\r\nwithout which leadership in Ireland brings misunderstanding and\r\ndisaster. In the English House he achieved total failure. Grattan\r\nfollowed him after the Union, but retained the attention if not the\r\npower of Dublin days. Neither influenced English affairs, and their\r\neloquence curiously was considered cold and sententious. Their\r\nrhapsody appeared artificial, and their exposition labored. The\r\nfailure of these men was no stigma. What is called \"Irish oratory\"\r\narose with the inclusion of the Celtic under strata in politics.\r\n\r\nBurke's speeches were delivered to an empty house. Though he lived\r\nout of Ireland and never became an Irish leader in Ireland, Burke had\r\nan influence in England greater than that of any Irishman before or\r\nsince. The beauty and diction of his speech fostered future\r\nparliamentary speaking. Macaulay, Gladstone, Peel, and Brougham were\r\nsuckled on him. His farthest reaching achievement was his treatment\r\nof the French Revolution. His single voice rolled back that storm in\r\nEurope. But no words could retard revolution in Ireland herself.\r\nVenal government made the noblest conservative thinking seem treason\r\nto the highest interests of the country. The temporary success of\r\nGrattan's parliament had been largely won by the Volunteers. They had\r\nbeen drilled, ostensibly against foreign invasion, but virtually to\r\nsecure reforms at home. Their power became one with which England had\r\nto reckon, and which she never forgave. Lord Charlemont, their\r\npresident, was an estimable country gentleman, but not a national\r\nleader. A more dashing figure appeared in the singular Earl of\r\nBristol. Though an Irish bishop and an English peer, he set himself\r\nin the front rank of the movement, assuming with general consent the\r\ndemeanor and trappings of royalty. He would not have hesitated to\r\nplunge Ireland into war, had he obtained Charlemont's position. But\r\nit was not so fated.\r\n\r\nAfter forcing parliamentary independence the Volunteers meekly\r\ndisbanded, and the United Irishmen took their place. The brilliancy\r\nof Grattan's parliament never fulfilled national aspirations. Bristol\r\nwas succeeded by another recruit from the aristocracy--Lord Edward\r\nFitzgerald. With Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet he has become legendary.\r\nAll three attained popular canonization, for all three sealed their\r\nbrief leadership with death.\r\n\r\nLord Edward was a dreamer, an Irish Bayard, too chivalrous to\r\nconspire successfully and too frankly courageous to match a\r\ngovernment of guile. Tone was far more dangerous. He realized that\r\nforeign invasion was necessary to successful rebellion, and he\r\nallowed no scruple or obstacle in his path. He washed his hands of\r\nlaw and politics entirely. To divert Napoleon to Ireland was his\r\nobject and the total separation of Ireland his ambition. The United\r\nIrishmen favored the invasion, which the Volunteers had been formed\r\nto repel. The feud between moral and physical force broke out. The\r\nfailure of the sterner policy in 1798 did not daunt Emmet from his\r\nill-starred attempt in 1803. He combined Lord Edward's chivalry with\r\nsome abilities worthy of Tone, but he failed. The failure he redeemed\r\nby a swan-song from the dock and a demeanor on the scaffold which\r\nhave become part of Irish tradition.\r\n\r\nAfter the Union, Irish leaders sprang up in the English House, which\r\nPitt had unwittingly made the cockpit of the racial struggle. Far\r\nfrom absorbing the Irish element, the Commons found themselves forced\r\nto resist, rally, and finally succumb.\r\n\r\nThe Irish House cannot be dismissed without mention of Curran. He was\r\na brilliant enemy of corruption and servility. O'Connell said \"there\r\nwas never so honest an Irishman,\" which may account for his greater\r\nsuccess as a lawyer than a politician. To be an Irish leader and a\r\nsuccessful lawyer is given to no man. For the former the sacrifice of\r\na great career is needed. This sacrifice Daniel O'Connell was\r\nprepared to make. His place in history will never be estimated, for\r\nfew have been so loved or hated, or for stronger reasons. Never did a\r\ntribune rising to power lift his people to such sudden hope and\r\nsuccess. Never did a champion leave his followers at his death and\r\ndecline to more terrible despair. Friend and foe admit his immensity.\r\nHe was the greatest Irishman that ever lived or seemingly could live.\r\nIn his own person he contained the whole genius of the Celt. Ireland\r\ncould not hold his emotions, which overflowed into the world for\r\nexpression. He rose on the crest of a religious agitation, but,\r\nEmancipation won, he had the foresight to associate the Irish cause\r\nwith the advent of Reform and Liberalism throughout Europe. He\r\nsounded the notes of free-trade and anti-slavery. What he said in\r\nparliament one day, Ireland re-echoed the next. To her he was all in\r\nall, her hero and her prophet, her Messias and her strong deliverer.\r\nOn the continent he roughly personified Christian Democracy.\r\n\r\nIn public oratory O'Connell introduced a new style. Torrential and\r\noverwhelming as Flood and Grattan had never been, he proved more\r\nsuccessful if less polished. The exaggerations of Gaelic speech found\r\noutburst in his English. Peel's smile was \"the silver plate on a\r\ncoffin\", Wellington \"a stunted corporal\", and Disraeli \"the lineal\r\ndescendant of the impenitent thief.\"\r\n\r\nIt sounds bombastic, but in those feudal forties it rang more\r\nmagnificent than war. Single-voiced he overawed the host of bigots,\r\ndullards, and reactionaries. Unhappily, he let his people abandon\r\ntheir native tongue, while teaching them how to balance the rival\r\nparties in England, the latter a policy that has proved Ireland's\r\nfortune since. He loosed the spirit of sectarianism in the tithe war,\r\nand he crushed the Young Ireland movement, which bred Fenianism in\r\nits death agony. But he made the Catholic a citizen. Results\r\nstupendous as far-reaching sprang from his steps every way.\r\n\r\nThe finest pen-sketch of O'Connell is by Mitchel, who says, \"besides\r\nsuperhuman and subterhuman passions, yet withal, a boundless fund of\r\nmasterly affectation and consummate histrionism, hating and loving\r\nheartily, outrageous in his merriment and passionate in his\r\nlamentation, he had the power to make other men hate or love, laugh\r\nor weep, at his good pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nYet during his lifetime there lived others worthy of national\r\nleadership. O'Brien, Duffy, and Davis played their part in England as\r\nwell as in Ireland. Father Mathew founded the Temperance, as Feargus\r\nO'Conor the Chartist, movement. And there was an orator who\r\nfascinated Gladstone--Sheil.\r\n\r\nFather Mathew succeeded in keeping many millions of men sober during\r\nthe forties until the great Famine engulfed his work as it did\r\nO'Connell's. To him is due, as a feature of Irish life, the brass\r\nband with banners, which he originally organized as a\r\ncounter-intoxicant.\r\n\r\nFeargus O'Conor founded Radical Socialism in England. As the Lion of\r\nFreedom, he enjoyed a popularity with English workmen approaching\r\nthat of O'Connell in Ireland. He ended in lunacy, but he had the\r\ncredit of forwarding peasant proprietorship far in advance of his\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nSheil was a tragic orator--\"an iambic rhapsodist\", O'Connell called\r\nhim--who might have been leader, did not a greater tragedian occupy\r\nthe stage. And Sheil was content to be O'Connell's organizer. Without\r\nO'Connell's voice or presence, he was his rhetorical superior,\r\nexcelling in irony and the by-plays of speech for which O'Connell was\r\ntoo exuberant. Shell's speeches touch exquisite though not the deep\r\nnotes of O'Connell, whom he criticized for \"throwing out broods of\r\nsturdy young ideas upon the world without a rag to cover them.\" He\r\ndiscredited his master and his cause by taking office. The fruits of\r\nEmancipation were tempting to those who had borne the heat of the\r\nday, but there was a rising school of patriots who refused\r\nacquiescence to anything less than total freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Young Irelanders reincarnated the men of \"ninety-eight.\" They\r\nwere neither too late nor too soon. They snatched the sacred torch of\r\nLiberty from the dying hands of O'Connell, who summoned in vain old\r\nIreland against his young rivals. But men like Davis and Duffy\r\nappealed to types O'Connell never swayed. He could carry the mob, but\r\npoet, journalist, and idealist were enrolled with Young Ireland. For\r\nthis reason the history of their failure is brighter in literature\r\nthan the tale of O'Connell's triumphs. To read Duffy's \"Young\r\nIreland\" and Mitchel's \"Jail Journal\", with draughts from the _Spirit\r\nof the Nation_. is to relive the period. Without the Young\r\nIrelanders, Irish Nationalism might not have survived the Famine.\r\n\r\nMitchel, as open advocate of physical force, became father to\r\nFenianism. An honest conspirator and brilliant writer, he proved that\r\nthe pen of journalism was sharper than the Irish pike. Carlyle\r\ndescribed him as \"a fine elastic-spirited young fellow, whom I\r\ngrieved to see rushing on destruction palpable, by attack of\r\nwindmills.\" Destruction came surely, but coupled with immortality. He\r\nwas transported as a felon before the insurrection, while his\r\nwritings sprang up in angry but unarmed men.\r\n\r\nMitchel and O'Connell both sought the liberation of Ireland, but\r\ntheir viewpoint differed. Mitchel thought only of Liberty; O'Connell\r\nnot unnaturally considered the \"Liberator.\" His refusal to allow a\r\ndrop of blood to be shed caused Young Ireland to secede. Only when\r\ndeath removed his influence could the pent-up feelings of the country\r\nbreak out under Smith O'Brien. If Mitchel was an Irish Robespierre,\r\nO'Brien was their Lafayette. His advance from the level of dead\r\naristocracy had been rapid. From defending Whigs in Parliament he\r\npassed to opposition and \"contempt of the House.\" He resigned from\r\nthe Bench from which O'Connell had been dismissed, became a Repealer,\r\nadding the words \"no compromise,\" and finally gloried in his treason\r\nbefore the House. His next step brought a price upon his head.\r\n\r\nGrave and frigid, but inwardly warmhearted and passionate, O'Brien\r\nhad little aptitude for rebellion. But the death penalty (commuted to\r\ntransportation) which he incurred went far to redeem his forlorn\r\nfailure. Mitchel, who shared his Australian imprisonment, left a fine\r\npicture of \"this noblest of Irishmen, thrust in among the\r\noff-scourings of England's gaols, with his home desolated and his\r\nhopes ruined, and defeated life falling into the sere and yellow\r\nleaf. A man, who cannot be crushed, or bowed, or broken; anchored\r\nimmovably upon his own brave heart within; his clear eye and soul\r\nopen as ever to all the melodies and splendors of heaven and earth,\r\nand calmly waiting for the angel, Death.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irish cause was not revived until the Fenian movement. Disgust\r\nwith the politicians drove the noblest into their ranks. In Stephens\r\nthey found an organizing chief, in Boyle O'Reilly a poet, and in John\r\nO'Leary a political thinker, men who under other conditions had\r\nachieved mundane success. The Fenians were defended by Isaac Butt, a\r\nbig-hearted, broad-minded lawyer, who afterwards organized a party to\r\nconvince Englishmen that Repeal was innocuous, when called \"Home\r\nRule.\" The people stood his patient ways patiently, but when a more\r\ndesperate leader arrived they transferred allegiance, and Butt died\r\nof a broken heart.\r\n\r\nParnell took his place and began to marshal the broken forces of\r\nIrish democracy against his own class. Butt had been a polite\r\nparliamentarian, reverencing the courtesy of debate and at heart\r\nloving the British Constitution. Parnell felt that his mission lay in\r\nbreaking rather than interpreting the law. The well-bred House stared\r\nand protested when he defied their chosen six hundred. Parnell faced\r\nthem with their own marble callousness. He outdid them in political\r\ncynicism and out-bowed them in frigid courtesy, while maintaining a\r\npolicy before which tradition melted and a time-honored system\r\ncollapsed. In one stormy decade he tore the cloak from the Mother of\r\nParliaments, reducing her to a plain-speaking democratic machine.\r\nThrough the breach he made, the English labor party has since\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nHe united priest and peasant, physical and moral force, under him. He\r\ncould lay Ireland under storm or lull at his pleasure. His\r\nachievement equalled his self-confidence. He reversed the Irish land\r\nsystem and threw English politics out of gear. With the balance of\r\npower in his hand, he made Tory and Radical outbid each other for his\r\nsupport. He was no organizer or orator, but he fascinated able men to\r\nconduct his schemes, as Napoleon used his marshals. On a pregnant day\r\nhe equaled the achievement of St. Paul and converted Gladstone, who\r\nhad once been his gaoler. Gladstone became a Home Ruler, and\r\nhenceforth English politics knew no peace.\r\n\r\nParnell stood for the fall and rise of many. Under his banner Irish\r\npeasants became human beings with human rights. He felled the feudal\r\nclass in Ireland and undermined them in England. Incalculable forces\r\nwere set to destroy him. A forged letter in the _Times_ classed him\r\nwith assassins, while an legal Commission was sent to try his whole\r\nmovement. It is history that his triumphant vindication was followed\r\nby a greater fall. The happiness of Ireland was sucked into the\r\nmaelstrom of his ruin. He refused to retire from leadership at\r\nGladstone's bidding, and Ireland staggered into civil war. The end is\r\nknown--Parnell died as he had lived. Of his moral fault there is no\r\npalliation, but it may be said he held his country's honor dearer\r\nthan his own, for he could not bear to see her win even independence\r\nby obeying the word of an Englishman.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nLecky: Leaders of Irish Opinion; Mitchel: Jail Journal; Duffy: Young\r\nIreland; O'Brien: Life of Parnell; D'Alton: History of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH HEROINES\r\n\r\nBy Alice Milligan\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worth and glory of a nation may well be measured and adjudged by\r\nthe typical character of its womanhood: not so much, I would say, by\r\nthe eminence attained to by rarely gifted, exceptionally developed\r\nindividuals, as by the prevalence of noble types at every period, and\r\namongst all classes of the community, and by their recurrence from\r\nage to age under varying circumstances of national fortune.\r\n\r\nJudged by such a standard, Ireland emerges triumphant and points to\r\nthe roll of her chequered history, the story of her ancient race,\r\nwith confidence and pride. Gaze into the farthest vistas of her\r\nlegendary past, into the remotest eras of which tradition preserves a\r\nmisty memory, and the figure of some fair, noble woman stands forth\r\nglimmering like a white statue against the gloom. At every period of\r\nstern endeavor, through all the generations of recorded time, the\r\npages of our annals are inscribed with the names of mothers, sisters,\r\nwives, not unworthy to stand there beside those of the world-renowned\r\nheroes of the Gael.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient tales of Ireland we read of great female physicians\r\nand distinguished female lawyers and judges. There were _ban-file_,\r\nor women-poets, who, like the _file_, were at the same time\r\nsoothsayers and poetesses, and there are other evidences of the high\r\nesteem in which women were held. There can be no doubt, to judge by\r\nthe elaborate descriptions of garments in the saga-texts, that the\r\nwomen were very skilful in weaving and needlework. The Irish peasant\r\ngirls of today inherit from them not a little of their gift for\r\nlace-making and linen-embroidery. Ladies of the highest rank\r\npracticed needlework as an accomplishment and a recreation. Some of\r\nthe scissors and shears they used have come to light in excavations.\r\n\r\nIn the stories of the loves of the ancient Irish, whether immortals\r\nor mortals, the woman's role is the more accentuated, while in\r\nTeutonic tradition man plays the chief part. Again, it has often been\r\nremarked that the feminine interest is absent from the earlier heroic\r\nforms of some literatures. Not so, however, in the earliest\r\nsaga-texts of the Irish. Many are the famous women to whom the old\r\ntales introduce us and who stand out and compel attention like the\r\ncharacters of the Greek drama. Everyone knows of the faithful\r\nDeirdre, the heroine of the touching story of the \"Exile of the Sons\r\nof Usnech\", and of her death; of the proud and selfish Medb. the\r\nambitious queen of Connacht, the most warlike and most expert in the\r\nuse of weapons of the women of the Gael--far superior in combat and\r\ncounsel to her husband, Ailill; of Emer, the faithful wife of\r\nCuchulainn; of Etain of the Horses (that was her name in Fairyland);\r\nand of many others too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\nIt is with the introduction of Christianity into Ireland that the\r\nIrish woman came into her rightful place, and attained the\r\npreponderating influence which she, ever since, has held among the\r\nCeltic people. In the period which followed the evangelization of the\r\nisland many were the \"women of worth\" who upheld the honor and glory\r\nof \"Inisfail the Fair\", and women were neither the less numerous nor\r\nthe less ardent who hung upon the lips of the Apostle of Ireland.\r\n\r\nAmid the galaxy of the saints, how lustrous, how divinely fair,\r\nshines the star of Brigid, the shepherd maiden of Faughard, the\r\ndisciple of Patrick the Apostle, the guardian of the holy light that\r\nburned beneath the oak-trees of Kildare! Over all Ireland and through\r\nthe Hebridean Isles, she is renowned above any other. We think of\r\nher, moreover, not alone, but as the centre of a great company of\r\ncloistered maidens, the refuge and helper of the sinful and\r\nsorrowful, who found in the gospel that Patrick preached a message of\r\nconsolation and deliverance. Let it be remembered that the shroud of\r\nPatrick is deemed to have been woven by Brigid's hand; that when she\r\ndied, in 525, Columcille, the future apostle of Scotland, was a child\r\nof four. So she stands midmost of that trilogy of saints whose dust\r\nis said to rest in Down.\r\n\r\nWho that hears of Columcille will forget how He won that name, \"dove\r\nof the Church\", because of his early piety, and that surely bespeaks\r\na mother's guiding care. Ethne, mother of Columcille, remains a vague\r\nbut picturesque figure, seen against the background of the rugged\r\nheath-clad hills of Tir-Conal by the bright blue waters of Gartan's\r\ntriple lake. Her hearth-stone or couch is shown there to this day,\r\nwhere once in slumber, before the birth of her son, she saw in a\r\nglorious visionary dream a symbol of his future greatness. A vast\r\nveil woven of sunshine and flowers seemed to float down upon her from\r\nheaven: an exquisitely poetic thought, which gives us warrant to\r\nbelieve that Columcille's poetic skill was inherited from his mother.\r\n\r\nRonnat, the mother of his biographer, St. Adamnan, plays a more\r\nnotable part in history, for, according to an ancient Gaelic text\r\nrecently published, it was to her that the women of Ireland owed the\r\nroyal decree which liberated them from military service. The story\r\ngoes that once, as she walked beside the Boyne, after some sanguinary\r\nconflict, she came upon the bodies of two women who had fallen in\r\nbattle. One grasped a reaping hook, the other a sword, and dreadful\r\nwounds disfigured them. Horrified at the sight, she brought strong\r\npressure to bear upon her son, and his influence in the councils of\r\nthe land availed to bring about the promulgation of the decree which\r\nfreed women from war-service.\r\n\r\nOur warrior kings had noble queens to rule their households, and of\r\nthese none stands out so distinctly after long lapse of time as\r\nGormlai, the daughter of Flann Siona, and wife of Nial Glondubh. Her\r\nstory has in it that element of romance which touches the heart and\r\nwins the sympathy of all who hear it.\r\n\r\nHer father was king of the Meathan branch of the Clan Nial, and\r\n_ard-ri_ of Ireland for thirty-seven years. Nial Glondubh was king of\r\nTir-Eoghain, and heir of Flann in the high kingship, for at that era\r\nit was the custom for the kings of Meath and of Tyrone to hold the\r\nsupreme power alternately. In order to knit north and south, Flann\r\nbetrothed his beautiful daughter to Cormac macCuillenan, king of\r\nCashel, an ideal husband, one would have thought, for a poetess like\r\nGormlai, for Cormac was the foremost scholar of the day; but his mind\r\nwas so set on learning and religion that he took holy orders and\r\nbecame bishop-king of Cashel, repudiating his destined bride. Gormlai\r\nwas then given as wife to Cearbhail, king of Leinster, and war was\r\nwaged against Cormac who was killed in the battle of Ballymoon.\r\nComing home wounded, Cearbhail lay on his couch, and while tended by\r\nGormlai and her ladies told the story of the battle and boasted of\r\nhaving insulted the dead body of King Cormac. Gormlai reproached him\r\nfor his ignoble conduct in such terms that his anger and jealousy\r\nflamed up, and striking her with his fist he hurled her to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nGormlai rose indignant and left his house forever, returning to the\r\npalace of King Flann, and on Cearbhail's death she at last found a\r\ntrue lover and worthy mate in Nial Glondubh, who brought her\r\nnorthward to rule over the famous palace of Aileach. In 916 Nial\r\nbecame high king, but the place of honor was also the place of\r\ndanger, and soon he led the mustered hosts of the north against the\r\npagan foreigners, who held Dublin and Fingal, and he fell in battle\r\nat Rathfarnham.\r\n\r\nA poem, preserved for us ever since, tells us that Gormlai was\r\npresent at his burial and chanted a funeral ode. Her long widowhood\r\nwas a period of disconsolate mourning. At length it is said she had a\r\ndream or vision, in which King Nial appeared to her in such life-like\r\nshape that she spread her arms to embrace him, and thus wounded her\r\nbreast against the carven head-post of her couch, and of that wound\r\nshe died.\r\n\r\nMany saintly, many noble, many hospitable and learned women lightened\r\nthe darkness that fell over Ireland after the coming of the Normans.\r\n\r\nI pass to the time when a sovereign lady filled the throne of\r\nEngland, \"the spacious days of great Elizabeth,\" which were also the\r\nperiod of Ireland's greatest, sternest struggle against a policy of\r\nextermination towards her nobles and suppression of her ancient\r\nfaith. Amid all the heroes and leaders of that wondrous age in\r\nIreland, there appears, like a reincarnation of legendary Medb, a\r\nwarlike queen in Connacht, Grace O'Malley, \"Granuaile\" of the\r\nballads. Instead of a chariot, she mounts to the prow of a\r\nswift-sailing galley, and sweeps over the wild Atlantic billows, from\r\nisle to isle, from coast to coast, taking tribute (or is it plunder?)\r\nfrom the clans. First an O'Flaherty is her husband, then a Norman\r\nBurke. In Clare Island they show her castle tower, with a hole in the\r\nwall, through which they say she tied a cable from her ship, ready by\r\nday or night for a summons from her seamen. She voyaged as far as\r\nLondon town, and stood face to face with the ruffed and hooped\r\nElizabeth, meeting her offer of an English title with the assertion\r\nthat she was a princess in her own land.\r\n\r\nThe mother of Red Hugh O'Donnell, Ineen-dubh, though daughter of the\r\nScottish Lord of the Isles, was none the less of the old Irish stock.\r\nHer character is finely sketched for us by the Franciscan chronicler\r\nwho wrote the story of the captivity and mighty deeds of her son.\r\nWhen the clans of Tir-Conal assembled to elect the youthful\r\nchieftain, he writes: \"It was an advantage that she came to the\r\ngathering, for she was the head of the advice and counsel of the\r\nCinel-Conail, and, though she was slow and deliberate and much\r\npraised for her womanly qualities, she had the heart of a hero and\r\nthe soul of a soldier.\" Her daughter, Nuala, is the \"woman of the\r\npiercing wail\" in Mangan's translation of the bard's lament for the\r\ndeath of the Ulster chieftains in Rome.\r\n\r\nModern critics like to interpret the \"Dark Rosaleen\" poem as an\r\nexpression of Red Hugh's devotion to Ireland, but I think that Rose,\r\nO'Doherty's daughter, wife of the peerless Owen Roe, deserves\r\nrecognition as she whose\r\n\r\n      \"Holy delicate white hands should girdle him with steel.\"\r\n\r\nThe record has come down to us that she prompted and encouraged her\r\nhusband to return from the low-countries and a position of dignity in\r\na foreign court to command the war in Ireland, and in her first\r\nletter, ere she followed him over sea, she asked eagerly: \"How stands\r\nTir-Conal?\" True daughter of Ulster was Owen's wife, so let us\r\nhenceforth acknowledge her as the _Roisin_ dubh, \"dark Rosaleen\", of\r\nthe sublimest of all patriot songs.\r\n\r\nIn the Cromwellian and Williamite wars, we see the mournful mothers\r\nand daughters of the Gaeldom passing in sad procession to Connacht,\r\nor wailing on Shannon banks for the flight of the \"Wild Geese.\" But\r\nwhat of Limerick wall, what of the valorous rush of the women of the\r\nbeleaguered city to stem the inroads of the besiegers and rally the\r\ndefenders to the breach? The decree of St. Adamnan was quite\r\nforgotten then, and when manly courage for a moment was daunted,\r\nwoman's fortitude replaced and reinspired it.\r\n\r\nAnd fortitude was sorely needed through the black years that\r\nfollowed--the penal days, when Ireland, crushed in the dust, bereft\r\nof arms, achieved a sublimer victory than did even King Brian\r\nhimself, champion of the Cross, against the last muster of European\r\nheathendom.\r\n\r\nYes, her women have done their share in making Ireland what she is, a\r\nheroic land, unconquered by long centuries of wrath and wrong, a land\r\nthat has not abandoned its Faith through stress of direst persecution\r\nor bartered it for the lure of worldly dominion; no--nor ever yielded\r\nto despair in face of repeated national disaster.\r\n\r\nIt was this fidelity to principle on the part of the Irish Catholic\r\npeople which won for them the alliance of all that were worthiest\r\namong the Protestants of north and south in the days of the\r\nVolunteers and the United Irishmen. What interesting and pathetic\r\nportraits of Irishwomen are added to our roll at this period! None is\r\nmore tenderly mournful than that of Sarah Curran, the beloved of\r\nRobert Emmet. The graceful prose of Washington Irving, the poignant\r\nverses of Moore, have enshrined the memory of her, weeping for him in\r\nthe shadow of the scaffold, dying of heart-break at last in a far-off\r\nland. No more need be said of her, for whom the pity of the whole\r\nworld has been awakened by song allied to sweetest, saddest music.\r\nWhat of Anne Devlin, Emmet's faithful servant, helping in his\r\npreparations for insurrection, aiding his flight, shielding him in\r\nhiding, even when tortured, scourged, half-hanged by a brutal\r\nsoldiery, with stern-shut lips refusing to utter a word to compromise\r\nher \"Master Robert\"?\r\n\r\nWhat of the sister of Henry Joy McCracken, Mary, the friend and\r\nfellow-worker with the Belfast United Irishmen? An independent,\r\nself-reliant business woman, she earned the money which she gave so\r\nliberally in the good cause, or to help the poor and distressed,\r\nthrough the whole period of a long life. Some still living have seen\r\nMary passing along the streets of Belfast, an aged woman, clad in\r\nsombre gown, to whom Catholic artisans raised their caps reverently,\r\nremembering how in '98 she had walked hand in hand with her brother\r\nto the steps of the scaffold, and how, in 1803, she had aided Thomas\r\nRussell in his escape from the north after Emmet's failure, had\r\nbribed his captors after arrest, provided for his defence, and\r\npreserved for futurity a record of his dying words. Madden's _History\r\nof the United Irishmen_, as far as it tells of the north, is mainly\r\nthe record that she kept as a sacred trust in letters, papers,\r\nlong-treasured memories of the men who fought and died to make\r\nIreland a united nation.\r\n\r\nAnd now a scene in America comes last to my mind. Wolfe Tone, a\r\npolitical fugitive who has served Ireland well and come through\r\ndanger to safety, is busy laying the foundations of a happy and\r\nprosperous future, with a beloved wife and sister and young children\r\nto brighten his home. An estate near Princeton, New Jersey, has been\r\nall but bought, possibilities of a career in the new republic open\r\nbefore him, when a letter comes from Belfast, asking him to return to\r\nthe post of danger, to undertake a mission to France for the sake of\r\nIreland. Let his own pen describe what happened: \"I handed the letter\r\nto my wife and sister and desired their opinion.... My wife\r\nespecially, whose courage and whose zeal for my honor and interest\r\nwere not in the least abated by all her past sufferings, supplicated\r\nme to let no consideration of her or our children stand for a moment\r\nin the way of my duty to our country, adding that she would answer\r\nfor our family during my absence and that the same Providence which\r\nhad so often, as it were, miraculously preserved us would not desert\r\nus now.\"\r\n\r\nInspired by the fortitude of this noble woman, Tone went forth on his\r\nperilous mission, and similarly the Young Ireland leaders, Mitchel\r\nand Smith O'Brien, were sustained by the courage of their nearest and\r\ndearest. \"Eva,\" the poetess of the _Nation_, gave her troth-plight to\r\none who had prison and exile to face ere he could claim her hand.\r\nOther names recur to me--\"Speranza\", with her lyric fire; Ellen\r\nO'Leary, fervent and still patient and wise; Fanny Parnell and her\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the women of Ireland today? Shall they come short of the\r\nhigh ideal of the past, falter and fail, if devotion and sacrifice\r\nare required of them? Never: whilst they keep in memory and honor the\r\nillustrious ones of whom I have written. The name of Irishwoman today\r\nstands for steadfast virtue, for hospitality, for simple piety, for\r\ncheerful endurance, and in a changing world let us trust it is the\r\nwill of God that in this there will be no change.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nOn Ethne, mother of St. Columcille: The Visions, Miracles, and\r\nProphecies of St. Columba (Clarendon Press Series).

The\r\ntranslation has been made by the Editors.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo those of us who are interested in the future of our country there\r\nis at this very moment presented a really serious problem. The\r\npolitical struggle of the last century has been so intense that many\r\nof our people have come to have none but a political solution in\r\nview. For them the whole question is one of politics, and they will\r\ncontinue to believe that Ireland will have found salvation the moment\r\nwe get Home Rule or something like it. Such an attitude seems natural\r\nenough when we remember what our people have suffered in the past.\r\nNevertheless, on a little reflection, this error--for error it is,\r\nand an enormous one, too--will be quickly dissipated. In the first\r\nplace, the political struggle of today is only the continuation of a\r\nconflict which has lasted seven hundred years, and in point of fact\r\nwe have a right to be proud that after so many trials there still\r\nremains to us anything of our national inheritance. We find ourselves\r\nindeed on the battlefield somewhat seriously bruised, but we can\r\nconsole ourselves with the thought that our opponent is in equally\r\ndoleful case, that he is beginning to suffer from a fatal weariness,\r\nand that he is anxious to make peace with us.\r\n\r\nIn order to place the present political situation in its true light\r\nand to take into account its comparatively limited importance, we\r\nmust not lose sight of the fundamental fact that what Home Rule\r\nconnotes is rather a tender of peace on the part of Ireland than a\r\ngift which England presents us of her own free will. In fact, our\r\nneighbor across the Channel has as much interest as ourselves, and\r\nperhaps even more, in bringing the struggle to an end. Through us,\r\nEngland has already lost much prestige, and that famous British\r\nConstitution, which in times past everyone admired while trying in\r\nvain to imitate it, has lost caste considerably. I am not now\r\nspeaking of the danger which an Ireland discontented, and even\r\nhostile, and having nothing to lose, would constitute for England in\r\ncase of war. It is especially from our neighbor's point of view that\r\nwe can cry up Home Rule or any other solution that will bring peace.\r\nBut let us leave to Great Britain the task of getting out of trouble\r\nas best she may. On our side, what shall we say of it?\r\n\r\nIn our conflict with the English we are not wearied; rather are we\r\nhardened for the fray. We have acquired the habit of fighting, and\r\nmany of us can now scarcely regulate our conduct in a manner suitable\r\nto a state of peace with England. Nevertheless, as I have already\r\nsaid, we have not emerged unscathed from this war of the centuries.\r\nNational sentiment remains with us, no doubt, and our traditions are\r\nnot wholly lost, especially among the country people of the West. But\r\nour commerce is almost ruined and the national language is no longer\r\nspoken throughout the greater part of the country. It is true that a\r\ncontinuation of the hitherto existing state of war cannot do us much\r\nmore harm; that for purposes of mere destruction all the advantages\r\nare on our side; and that on the other hand we can begin a\r\nreconstruction at home without waiting for a treaty of peace to be\r\nsigned. But we have some things to do for which a home government\r\nwould be useful to us, and further, in the absence of such a\r\ngovernment, it would be difficult to imagine what means could be\r\nemployed to turn the people away from their too exclusive absorption\r\nin Anglo-Irish politics.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, from a practical point of view that we wish for peace.\r\nBut, we may lawfully ask, will not this peace bring with it a special\r\ndanger, against which we ought to take precautions? As a matter of\r\nfact, there is such a danger, and it lies in the fact that the people\r\nhave been to so great an extent obsessed by the political struggle\r\nthat they run the risk, once their end is attained, of collapsing and\r\nof losing interest in the national question. Let us not forget that\r\nthat question is to save our language and our civilization; without\r\nthat, it is all over with our nationality. Let us endeavor to turn\r\nour parliament to account in order to work seriously on the\r\nreconstruction of our national life, and it is certain that Ireland\r\nwill find therein her salvation.\r\n\r\nWe can, therefore, take advantage either of England's prolonged\r\nresistance or of peace. If England decides to continue the contest,\r\nshe will suffer more from it than we. Her empire, her institutions,\r\nher safety, will be more and more impaired, while, as for us, there\r\nwill result a strong growth in patriotism and in anti-British\r\nbitterness. What we have to do, right now, is to take our bearings in\r\nsuch a way that, no matter what happens to England, our own future\r\nshall be assured. We can do it if we wish it: the question is, shall\r\nwe wish it?\r\n\r\nHere it may be objected, _Cui bono_ The English language is quite\r\nenough for us. We have it now and we speak it, sometimes, even better\r\nthan the English people themselves. We are proud of using the same\r\nlanguage as Sheridan, Burke, and Grattan used. Such an opinion has\r\nits modicum of truth, though less now than a hundred years ago.\r\nFormerly there was in Ireland, and especially around Dublin, a little\r\ncolony of Anglo-Irish. The members of this colony spoke a very pure\r\nand classic English, and this fact is largely responsible for the\r\nplace which Ireland at one time held in English literature. But\r\nduring the last century the remains of this colony have been swamped\r\nbeneath a flood of half-Anglicized people, of Irishmen from the\r\ncountry districts, who were formerly excluded, and who brought with\r\nthem such a mixture of expressions and of phonetic tendencies derived\r\nfrom the Gaelic that the language of Grattan, Sheridan, and Burke has\r\nwell-nigh gone out of existence. The reason of this is that since the\r\ndate of Catholic emancipation, most careers are open to everybody.\r\nThe result has been that the newly enfranchised majority has\r\nultimately absorbed the minority, and that the atmosphere of culture,\r\nof which we have just spoken, has disappeared. We thus reach an\r\nIreland which, in a sense, has neither culture nor language, a\r\ncountry in which the Gaelic spoken by a people humiliated and deeply\r\ndemoralized by an anti-Catholic legislation, which was both savage\r\nand degrading, tended to coalesce with an English already condemned\r\nto death. It is from the moment when the Catholics had finally\r\ntriumphed over persecution that we must date the beginning of that\r\npolitical struggle with which we are familiar, a struggle which has\r\nresulted in absorbing all the energies of a great part of the\r\npopulation. That is why this tremendous problem presents itself to\r\nus, at the very time when we should be justified in feeling ourselves\r\nelated by triumph because of our victories in parliament. And let not\r\nEngland rejoice too much at our dilemma. If we are doomed to die, she\r\nwill die with us, for before disappearing we shall prove to be a\r\ngreat destructive force, and out of the ruins of the British power we\r\nshall raise such a monument that future generations will know what it\r\ncosts to murder a nation.\r\n\r\nBut, if possible, we must live and let live. The elements of\r\nreconstruction are always at hand. Anglo-Irish culture is indeed\r\ndead, but Gaelic culture is only seriously sick, and on that side\r\nthere is always room for hope. Sooth to say, its sickness consists\r\nabove all in the fact that the Irish language is no longer spoken in\r\na great part of the country. But, on the other hand, where it is\r\npreserved, that same language is spoken in all its purity. By going\r\nthere to find it all Ireland will gradually become Gaelic.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be objected, what a loss of time and energy! If it is a\r\nquestion of languages, why not learn one of the more useful ones? To\r\nthis we may reply that, while English deforms the mouth and makes it\r\nincapable of pronouncing any language which is not spoken from the\r\ntip of the lips, Gaelic, on the contrary, so exercises the organs of\r\nspeech that it renders easy the acquisition and the practice of most\r\nEuropean idioms. Let us add, by way of example, that French, which is\r\nusually difficult for strangers, is much more within the compass of\r\nIrishmen who speak Irish, no less because of certain linguistic\r\ncustoms than from the original relationship between the two\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nThis remark brings us to another objection which is often lodged\r\nagainst our movement. It is urged that Ireland is already isolated\r\nenough, and that by making it a Gaelic-speaking nation, we shall make\r\nthat state of affairs still worse. English, say the objectors, is\r\nspoken more or less everywhere, while Gaelic will never be able to\r\nclaim the position of a quasi-universal language. To this line of\r\nreasoning it might be answered, for one thing, that no one can tell\r\nhow far Gaelic will go, in case our movement is a success, and that\r\nmany a language formerly \"universal\" is today as dead as a door-nail.\r\nBut we must look at the question from another point of view. John\r\nBull's language is spread everywhere, while he himself retains the\r\nmost exclusive insularity. He travels to every land and there finds\r\nhis own language and his own customs. Now it goes without saying that\r\nfrom this very universalization his language is corrupted and becomes\r\nvulgarized. The idiom of Shakespeare and Milton gives place gradually\r\nto the idiom of the seaports. Furthermore, far from isolating us,\r\nGaelic will tend to put us in touch with the civilization of the\r\nWest. As a people Anglicised, and badly Anglicised at that, we share,\r\nand even exaggerate, the faults which I have just described. It is\r\nAnglo-Saxon speech which isolates us, and we wish on this ground to\r\nbreak with it and to hold out our hand to our brothers of the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said, what a pity to dig yet another abyss between\r\nIreland and Great Britain, for it is with the latter that our\r\ngeographical position will always link us for common defense. For,\r\nwhile it is true that history does not show us a single case of an\r\nempire which has not sooner or later fallen to pieces, nevertheless,\r\nwhatever happens, the two islands will be necessarily forced to\r\nco-operate for the common good. Well, let us take it that things will\r\nso fall out, and let us suppose an Anglicised Ireland called upon to\r\nface such a situation. It would be a revolutionary Ireland, a\r\nrestless Ireland, an Ireland seeking vaguely for revenge on someone,\r\ndeprived of really national character, and, in a general way,\r\nsuspecting England of responsibility for the disappearance from our\r\ncountry of everything that constitutes the idea of nationality. And\r\nlet us remark that we are no longer living in those good old times\r\nwhen entire nations allowed themselves to be absorbed by their\r\nconquerors. The art of printing has changed all that. Today a\r\n\"suppressed\" nation is one that will sooner or later have its\r\nrevenge. Thus let us suppose that we are destined to make political\r\npeace with England and to enter of our own accord into a\r\nHiberno-Britannic confederation. From our point of view, what would\r\nbe the result of that arrangement? The result would be strange. Here\r\nagain, as in the case of Home Rule, it is rather we who offer\r\nadvantages to England than she who offers them to us. Only, in this\r\nlatter case, the result depends on ourselves alone. If we die, it\r\nwill be because we have wished it. Our language is not dead; on the\r\ncontrary, although not widely spread, it is in itself much more alive\r\nthan English, which as a literary language is in full decay. We may\r\ncongratulate ourselves that our idiom is intact. Our civilization is\r\nold, but it has not yet lived its full life. If we wish, the future\r\nis ours. And let us truly believe that that is worth while, for the\r\nrace which has produced epics like those of Ossian and all that\r\nmagnificent literature which has been preserved for us through the\r\nages, the race that gave to Europe that great impulse of missionary\r\nactivity which is associated with the names of Columcille, Brendan,\r\nColumbanus, and Gall, not to mention men like the famous Scotus\r\nErigena--that race is certainly called upon to play an important part\r\nin the modern world. But--let us repeat it--it must have the wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMOUS IRISH SOCIETIES\r\n\r\nBy JOHN O'DEA,\r\n\r\n_National Historian, A.O.H._.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the social organization of no nation of antiquity were societies\r\nof greater influence than in pagan Ireland. During many centuries\r\nthese societies, composed of the bards, ollamhs, brehons, druids, and\r\nknights, contended for precedence. In no country did the literary\r\nsocieties display greater vigor and exercise a more beneficent power\r\nthan in pagan Ireland. Although the Hebrews and other Asiatic nations\r\nhad societies organized from among the professions, yet in Ireland\r\nalone these societies seem to have been constructed with a patriotic\r\npurpose, and in Ireland alone they seem to have had ceremonies of\r\ninitiation, with constitutions and laws. These societies existed from\r\nthe earliest times until after the coming of St. Patrick. Traces of\r\nthem are visible during all the centuries from the conversion of\r\nIreland down to the Anglo-Norman epoch, and it is apparent that the\r\nclan system and the introduction of the feudal system by the English\r\nfailed to eliminate completely their influence.\r\n\r\nWhen the Irish emigration flowed towards the American colonies in the\r\neighteenth century, the social instinct early found expression in\r\nsocieties. One of the earliest of these was founded in Boston, where,\r\nin 1737, twenty-six \"gentlemen merchants and others, natives of\r\nIreland or of Irish extraction\", organized the Charitable Irish\r\nSociety. In Pennsylvania, where the Irish emigration had been larger\r\nthan in any other colony, the Hibernian Fire Company was organized in\r\n1751. The Friendly Sons of St. Patrick was founded in Philadelphia in\r\n1771, and about that time societies bearing this name were founded in\r\nBoston and New York, as convivial clubs welcoming Irish emigrants to\r\ntheir festive boards. These societies were formed upon the model of\r\nthe Friendly Brothers of St. Patrick, which had existed in Dublin and\r\nother Irish cities a generation before, and was well and favorably\r\nknown throughout Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in Philadelphia\r\ncontained some of the most prominent merchants and leading citizens\r\nof the city, and in 1780 they subscribed £103,000, or one-third of\r\nthe sum collected, to supply the Continental army with food. Among\r\nits members were Commodore Barry, the Father of the American Navy;\r\nGeneral Stephen Moylan; General Anthony Wayne; and the great\r\nmerchants, Blair McClenachan, Thomas Fitzsimons, and Robert Morris.\r\nWashington, who was an honorary member, described it \"as a society\r\ndistinguished for the firm adherence of its members to the glorious\r\ncause in which we are embarked.\" Whether upon the field or upon the\r\nsea, in council or in the sacrifice of their wealth, their names are\r\nforemost in the crisis of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Hibernian Society for the Relief of Emigrants from Ireland was\r\nfounded in Philadelphia on March 3, 1790. Other Hibernian Societies,\r\nwith the same title and organized for the same purpose, were founded\r\nin other cities along the Atlantic coast in the early years of the\r\nnineteenth century, but the Philadelphia Hibernian Society was, from\r\nthe character of its members, the extent of its beneficence, and the\r\nlength of its existence, the most famous. The emigrants from Ireland\r\nduring the eighteenth century had pushed on to the frontier, or, in\r\nsome instances, remained in the cities and engaged successfully in\r\nmercantile pursuits. The emigration which came after the Revolution\r\nwas, however, in great part composed of families almost without\r\nmeans. Unable to subsist while clearing farms in the virgin forest,\r\nthousands were congested in the cities. The Hibernian Society\r\nextended a ready and strong hand to these helpless people, and not\r\nonly aided the emigrants with gifts of money, but also secured for\r\nthem employment, disseminated among them useful information, and\r\nprovided them with medical attendance. While the Hibernian Society\r\nwas regarded as the successor of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick,\r\nyet the two societies, which contained largely a membership roll\r\nbearing the same names, flourished, in the work of patriotism, side\r\nby side. The first officers of the Hibernian Society for the Relief\r\nof Emigrants from Ireland were: President, Chief Justice Thomas\r\nMcKean; Vice-President, General Walter Stewart; Secretary, Matthew\r\nCarey, the historian; Treasurer, John Taylor. It was said that no\r\nother society in America contained so many men distinguished in\r\ncivil, military, and official life as the Hibernian Society. In\r\nalmost every city where the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick and the\r\nHibernian Society for the Relief of Emigrants were found, there was a\r\nclose and intimate connection between them, which ultimately resulted\r\nin amalgamation.\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Order of Hibernians traces its origin to those orders\r\nwhich flourished in pagan Ireland, and which exercised so potent an\r\ninfluence upon the history of the Celtic race. The order of\r\nknighthood was the first of these orders to be founded. It existed\r\nfrom the earliest times, and is visible in the annals of the nation,\r\nuntil the Anglo-Normans invaded the land in the twelfth century. In\r\npagan Ireland the knightly orders became provincial standing armies,\r\nand there are many glorious pages describing the feats of the Clanna\r\nDeagha of Munster, the Clanna Morna of Connacht, the Feni of\r\nLeinster, and the Knights of the Red Branch of Ulster. When the\r\nisland was Christianized, these knightly orders were among the\r\nstaunchest supporters of the missionary priests, and were consecrated\r\nto the service of the church in the sixth century, assuming the cross\r\nas their distinctive emblem, and becoming the defenders of religion.\r\n\r\nAmong the names which are upon the rolls of the ancient orders of\r\nknighthood are those of most of the kings, bards, saints, and\r\nstatesmen, and in the long list there was no family of greater renown\r\nthan that of Roderick the Great, to which belonged Conall Cearnach\r\nand Lugaidh, who, according to MacGeoghegan and others, were the\r\ndirect ancestors of the O'Mores of Leix. In this family the ancient\r\nsplendor of the knightly orders was a tradition which survived for\r\ncenturies, and they were in almost continual rebellion against the\r\nEnglish, from the siege of Dublin by Roderick O'Connor until the\r\nrebellion against Queen Elizabeth, led by Rory Oge O'More and his son\r\nOwen in the latter part of the sixteenth and the early seventeenth\r\ncentury. A nephew of Rory Oge, the sagacious and statesmanlike Rory\r\nO'More, revived the ancient orders in the Catholic Confederation of\r\nKilkenny in 1642. A grandson of Rory O'More, Patrick Sarsfield, Earl\r\nof Lucan, was the most distinguished commander of Irish armies who\r\nopposed, in Ireland, the forces of William of Orange.\r\n\r\nThere is no stranger story in all history than the intimate\r\nconnection of the O'More family with the annals of the Ancient Order\r\nof Hibernians. The lineage of this family furnishes the links\r\nconnecting the ancient orders of pagan Ireland through the centuries\r\nwith the Ancient Order in modern times. Under the names of Rapparees,\r\nWhiteboys, Defenders, Ribbonmen, etc., the Confederation of Kilkenny\r\nwas carried on through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries until\r\nthe nineteenth. At various times the duties of these organizations\r\nwere subject to local conditions. Thus the Defenders were occupied in\r\nprotecting themselves and their priests against the hostility of the\r\nPenal Laws, engaging in armed conflict with the Orangemen in the\r\nnorth, while the Whiteboys were waging war against the atrocities of\r\nlandlordism in the south. Between these two organizations there was a\r\nsecret code, which operated until they were combined, under the name\r\nof Ribbonmen, in the early nineteenth century. The contentions of the\r\nWhiteboys regarding Irish landlordism have since been acknowledged to\r\nbe just, and have been enacted into statutes. The Defenders joined\r\nwith Wolfe Tone in the formation of the United Irishmen.\r\n\r\nAbout 1825 the Ribbonmen changed their name to St. Patrick's\r\nFraternal Society, and branches were established in England and\r\nScotland under the name of the Hibernian Funeral Society. In 1836 a\r\ncharter was received by members in New York City, and in Schuylkill\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania. The headquarters were for some years in\r\nPennsylvania, but in 1851 a charter was granted to the New York\r\nDivisions under the name of \"The Ancient Order of Hibernians.\" New\r\nYork thus became the American headquarters. National conventions were\r\nheld there until 1878, since which year they have been held in many\r\nother cities biennially. Many of the most distinguished leaders of\r\nthe Irish race in America have been members of the Order, and from a\r\nhumble beginning, with a few emigrants gathered together in a strange\r\nland, the membership has grown to nearly 200,000. General Thomas\r\nFrancis Meagher, Colonel Michael Doheny, General Michael Corcoran,\r\nand Colonel John O'Mahony were among the members in the late '50's.\r\n\r\nAmong the organizations which have sprung from the ranks of the\r\nA.O.H. were the powerful Fenian Brotherhood, the Emmet Monument\r\nAssociation, and scores of smaller associations in all sections of\r\nthe United States and Canada. During the Know Nothing riots, the\r\nOrder furnished armed defenders for the Catholic churches in New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, and Charleston, and it has ever been foremost in\r\npreserving its position as the hereditary defender of the faith. In\r\n1894, the Ladies' Auxiliary was founded, and this body of women\r\nnumbered in 1914 over 63,000, and had donated great sums to charity,\r\neducation, and religion. The A.O.H. had, in 1914, assets of\r\n$2,230,000. It pays annually, for charity, sick and death benefits,\r\nand maintenance, over $1,000,000, and during its existence in America\r\nhas donated nearly $20,000,000 to works of beneficence. One of the\r\nmost celebrated of the gifts of the Order was the endowment of the\r\nChair of Celtic in the Catholic University of America, and one of its\r\ngreatest gifts to charity was its contribution of $40,000 to the\r\nsufferers from the San Francisco earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe Clan-na-Gael is a society organized to secure the independence of\r\nIreland by armed revolution. Its organization is secret and it is the\r\nsuccessor of the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, called in America\r\nthe Fenian Brotherhood, which promoted many daring raids and risings\r\nin Ireland in 1867. The I.R.B. was perfected by James Stephens in\r\nIreland, and by John O'Mahony in America, from 1857 to 1867. An\r\ninvasion of Canada was made in great force under the general\r\ndirection of Colonel William R. Roberts, president of the Fenian\r\nBrotherhood, but was unsuccessful owing to the attitude of the United\r\nStates Government, which declared that the Fenians were violating the\r\nprinciples of neutrality. After the disorganization of the Fenian\r\nBrotherhood, the idea of revolution languished until revived by the\r\nfounding of the Clan-na-Gael by Jerome J. Collins in 1869, and the\r\nmembership during the twenty years from 1880 to 1900 included almost\r\nfifty thousand of the flower of the men of Irish blood in America.\r\nThe principle of revolution was first given organized public\r\nexpression in America through the formation in 1848 of the Irish\r\nRepublican Union, which was succeeded by the Emmet Monument\r\nAssociation, these societies influencing the creation of the\r\nSixty-Ninth and Seventy-Fifth Regiments of the New York State\r\nMilitia, and the Ninth Massachusetts, which became so famous for\r\nvalor during the Civil War. Although not putting forth all its\r\nstrength, so as to allow full scope to the parliamentary efforts to\r\nameliorate the state of the Irish people, the Clan-na-Gael is as\r\nvigorous a section as ever of the forces organized for the service of\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\nThe Land League, founded in Ireland in 1879, was transplanted to\r\nAmerica in 1880, when the first branch was established in New York\r\nCity through the efforts of Patrick Ford, John Boyle O'Reilly, John\r\nDevoy, and others. Michael Davitt soon after came to America and\r\ntravelled through the country founding branches of the League. In a\r\nfew years the whole American continent was organized, and in this\r\norganization Michael Davitt declared that the members of the Ancient\r\nOrder of Hibernians and the Clan-na-Gael were everywhere foremost. To\r\nthe enormous sums collected by the League in this country, and to the\r\nmagnificent labors of Parnell, Davitt, Redmond, Ferguson, Dillon,\r\nKettle, Webb, and others in Ireland, is due in a large measure the\r\npresent improved state of the people, resulting from the sacrifices\r\nmade by those who supported this greatest of leagues devoted to the\r\namelioration of unbearable economic conditions. A Ladies' Auxiliary\r\nto the Land League was established by the sisters of Parnell, and was\r\nfor some years a brilliant vindication of the power and justice of\r\nfeminine participation in public questions.\r\n\r\nThe Land League, the name of which was changed to the Irish National\r\nLeague in the early '80's, having prepared the path to eventual\r\nvictory, declined in potency after the political movement was divided\r\ninto Parnellites and Anti-Parnellites in 1890. The elements composing\r\nthese rival parties were, through the initiative of William O'Brien,\r\nM.P., and in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Irishmen of Wolfe Tone's day, joined in 1898 under the name of\r\nthe United Irish League, John E. Redmond becoming the first\r\npresident, and also the chairman of the Parliamentary Party which it\r\nhad been instrumental in uniting. This organization is now a living,\r\nvital force in the affairs of Ireland on both sides of the Atlantic,\r\nMr. Redmond being still its head, with Michael J. Ryan, of\r\nPhiladelphia, as president of the American Branch.\r\n\r\nThe Knights of Columbus were organized in 1881 by Rev. Michael\r\nMcGivney, in New Haven, Connecticut, and a charter was granted by the\r\nConnecticut Legislature on March 29,1882. At first the activity of\r\nthe organization was confined to Connecticut, but the time was ripe\r\nfor its mission, and it soon spread rapidly throughout New England.\r\nIn 1896 it began to attract the attention of Catholic young men in\r\nother parts of the nation, and during the next few years its appeal\r\nwas made irresistibly in almost every State. It now exists in all the\r\nStates of the Union, the Dominion of Canada, Nova Scotia,\r\nNewfoundland, Panama, Porto Rico, Mexico, Cuba, and the Philippine\r\nIslands, with a total membership of 328,000, of whom 108,000 are\r\ninsurance members and 220,000 associate members. Its mortuary reserve\r\nfund is $4,500,000, being over $1,000,000 more than is required by\r\nlaw. It is one of the most successful fraternal societies ever\r\norganized, and the Irish-American Catholics have given to it the full\r\nstrength of their enthusiasm and purpose.\r\n\r\nThe temperance movement among Catholics was, from the visit of Father\r\nMathew in 1849, largely Irish. The societies first formed were united\r\nby no bond until 1871, when the Connecticut societies formed a State\r\nUnion. Other States formed unions and a national convention in\r\nBaltimore in 1872 created a National Union. In 1878 there were 90,000\r\npriests, laymen, women, and children in the Catholic Total Abstinence\r\nBenevolent Union. In 1883 the Union was introduced into Canada, and\r\nin 1895 there were 150,000 members on the American continent. From\r\nthe C.T.A.B.U. were formed the Knights of Father Mathew, a total\r\nabstinence and semi-military body, first instituted in St. Louis in\r\n1872.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Knights of America, with a membership chiefly\r\nIrish-American, were organized in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1877, and\r\nthe advantages offered for insurance soon attracted 20,000 members.\r\nThe decade of the '70's was prolific of Irish Catholic associations.\r\nThe Catholic Benevolent Legion was founded in 1873, shortly followed\r\nby the Catholic Mutual Benevolent Association, the Catholic Order of\r\nForesters (which started in Massachusetts and spread to other\r\nStates), the Irish Catholic Benevolent Union, and the Society of the\r\nHoly Name, which latter, although tracing its origin to Lisbon in\r\n1432, is yet dominantly Irish in America.\r\n\r\nIn the large industrial centres there are scores of Irish county and\r\nother societies composed of Irishmen and Irish-Americans, organized\r\nfor the service of country and faith, beneficence and education, and\r\nall dedicated to the uplifting of humanity and to the progress of\r\ncivilization. The ancient genius for organization has not been lost,\r\nthe spirit of brotherhood pulsates strongly in the Irish heart, and\r\nthrough its powerful societies the race retains its place in the\r\nadvance of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nJohn M.

O'BRIEN,\r\n\r\n_Historiographer, American Irish Historical Society_.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents of early American history will find in the Colonial records\r\nabundant evidence to justify the statement of Ramsay, the historian\r\nof South Carolina, when he wrote in 1789, that:\r\n\r\n\"The Colonies which now form the United States may be considered as\r\nEurope transplanted. Ireland, England, Scotland, France, Germany,\r\nHolland, Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, and Italy furnished the\r\noriginal stock of the present population, and are generally supposed\r\nto have contributed to it in the order named. For the last seventy or\r\neighty years, no nation has contributed so much to the population of\r\nAmerica as Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be astonishing to one who looks into the question to find\r\nthat, in face of all the evidence that abounds in American annals,\r\nshowing that our people were here on this soil fighting the battles\r\nof the colonists, and in a later day of the infant Republic, thus\r\nproving our claim to the gratitude of this nation, America has\r\nproduced men so ignoble and disingenuous as to say that the Irish who\r\nwere here in Revolutionary days \"were for the most part heartily\r\nloyal,\" that \"the combatants were of the same race and blood\", and\r\nthat the great uprising became, in fact, \"a contest between\r\nbrothers\"!\r\n\r\nAlthough many writers have made inquiries into this subject, nearly\r\nall have confined themselves to the period of the Revolution. We are\r\nof \"the fighting race\", and in our enthusiasm for the fighting man\r\nthe fact seems to have been overlooked that in other noble fields of\r\nendeavor, and in some respects infinitely more important, men of\r\nIrish blood have occupied prominent places in American history, for\r\nwhich they have received but scant recognition. The pioneers before\r\nwhose hands the primeval forests fell prostrate; the builders, by\r\nwhose magic touch have sprung into existence flourishing towns and\r\ncities, where once no sounds were heard save those of nature and her\r\nwildest offspring; the orators who roused the colonists into activity\r\nand showed them the way to achieve their independence; the\r\nschoolmasters who imparted to the American youth their first lessons\r\nin intellectuality and patriotism; all have their place in history,\r\nand of these we can claim that Ireland furnished her full quota to\r\nthe American colonies.\r\n\r\nIt must now be accepted as an indisputable fact that a very large\r\nproportion of the earliest settlers in the American colonies were of\r\nIrish blood, for the Irish have been coming here since the beginning\r\nof the English colonization. It has been estimated by competent\r\nauthorities that in the middle of the seventeenth century the\r\nEnglish-speaking colonists numbered 50,000. Sir William Petty, the\r\nEnglish statistician, tells us that during the decade from 1649 to\r\n1659 the annual emigration from Ireland to the western continent was\r\nupwards of 6000, thus making, in that space of time, 60,000 souls, or\r\nabout one-half of what the whole population must have been in 1659.\r\nAnd from 1659 to 1672 there emigrated from Ireland to America the\r\nyearly number of 3000 (Dobbs, on Irish Trade, Dublin, 1729).\r\nPrendergast, another noted authority, in the _Cromwellian Settlement\r\nof Ireland_, furnishes ample verification of this by the statistics\r\nwhich he quotes from the English records. Richard Hakluyt, the\r\nchronicler of the first Virginia expeditions, in his _Voyages,\r\nNavigations, Traffiques, and Discoveries of the English Nation_\r\n(London, 1600), shows that Irishmen came with Raleigh to Virginia in\r\n1587 and, in fact, the ubiquitous Celts were with Sir John Hawkins in\r\nhis voyage to the Gulf of Mexico twenty years earlier. The famous\r\nwork of John Camden Hotten, entitled \"The Original Lists of Persons\r\nof Quality, Emigrants, Religious Exiles, Political Rebels, Serving\r\nMen sold for a term of years,\" etc., who were brought to the Virginia\r\nplantations between 1600 and 1700, as well as his \"List of the\r\nLivinge and the Dead in Virginia in 1623,\" contains numerous Celtic\r\nnames, and further evidence of these continuous migrations of the\r\nIrish is contained in \"A Booke of Entrie for Passengers passing\r\nbeyond the Seas\", in the year 1632. The Virginia records also show\r\nthat as early as 1621 a colony of Irish people sailed from Cork in\r\nthe _Flying Harte_ under the patronage of Sir William Newce and\r\nlocated at what is now Newport News, and some few years later Daniel\r\nGookin, a merchant of Cork, transported hither \"great multitudes of\r\npeople and cattle\" from England and Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the \"William and Mary College Quarterly,\" in the transcripts of\r\nthe original records published by the Virginia Historical Society,\r\nand in all County histories of Virginia, there are numerous\r\nreferences to the Irish \"redemptioners\" who were brought to that\r\ncolony during the seventeenth century. But the redemptioners were not\r\nthe only class who came, for the colonial records also contain many\r\nreferences to Irishmen of good birth and education who received\r\ngrants of land in the colony and who, in turn, induced many of their\r\ncountrymen to emigrate. Planters named McCarty, Lynch, O'Neill,\r\nSullivan, Farrell, McDonnell, O'Brien, and others denoting an ancient\r\nIrish lineage appear frequently in the early records. Much that is\r\nromantic is found in the lives of these men and their descendants.\r\nSome of them served in the Council chamber and the field, their sons\r\nand daughters were educated to hold place, with elegance and dignity,\r\nwith the foremost of the Cavaliers, and when in after years the great\r\nconflict with England began, Virginians of Irish blood were among the\r\nfirst and the most eager to answer the call. Those historians who\r\nclaim that the South was exclusively an \"Anglo-Saxon\" heritage would\r\nbe completely disillusioned were they to examine the lists of\r\nColonial and Revolutionary troops of Celtic name who held the Indians\r\nand the British at bay, and who helped in those \"troublous times\" to\r\nlay the foundations of a great Republic.\r\n\r\nThere is no portion of the Atlantic seaboard that did not profit by\r\nthe Irish immigrations of the seventeenth century. We learn from the\r\n\"Irish State Papers\" of the year 1595 that ships were regularly\r\nplying between Ireland and Newfoundland, and so important was the\r\ntrade between Ireland and the far-distant fishing banks that \"all\r\nEnglish ships bound out always made provisions that the convoy out\r\nshould remain 48 hours in Cork.\" In some of Lord Baltimore's accounts\r\nof his voyages to Newfoundland he refers to his having \"sailed from\r\nIreland\" and to his \"return to Ireland,\" and so it is highly probable\r\nthat he settled Irishmen on his Avalon plantations. After Baltimore's\r\ndeparture, Lord Falkland also sent out a number of Irish colonists,\r\nand \"at a later date they were so largely reinforced by settlers from\r\nIreland that the Celtic part of the population at this day is not far\r\nshort of equality in numbers with the Saxon portion\"--(Hatton and\r\nHarvey, _History of Newfoundland_, page 32). Pedley attributes the\r\nlarge proportion of Irishmen and the influence of the Catholics in\r\nNewfoundland to Lord Falkland's company, and Prowse, in his History\r\n(pp. 200-201), refers to \"the large number of Irishmen\" in that\r\ncolony who fled from Waterford and Cork \"during the troubled times\"\r\nwhich preceded the Williamite war (1688). Many of these in after\r\nyears are known to have settled in New England.\r\n\r\nBut it was to Maryland and Pennsylvania that the greatest flow of\r\nIrish immigration directed its course. In the celebrated \"Account of\r\nthe Voyage to Maryland,\" written in the year 1634 by Mutius\r\nVitellestis, the general of the Jesuit Order, it is related that when\r\nthe _Arke_ and the _Dove_ arrived in the West Indies in that year,\r\nthey found \"the island of Montserrat inhabited by a colony of\r\nIrishmen who had been banished from Virginia on account of their\r\nprofessing the Catholic faith.\" It is known also that there were many\r\nfamilies in Ireland of substance and good social standing who, at\r\ntheir own expense, took venture in the enterprise of Lord Baltimore\r\nand afterwards in that of William Penn, and who applied for and\r\nreceived grants of land, which, as the deeds on record show, were\r\nafterwards divided into farms bought and settled by O'Briens,\r\nMcCarthys, O'Connors, and many others of the ancient Gaelic race, the\r\ndescendants of those heroic men whose passion for liberty, while\r\ncausing their ruin, inspired and impelled their sons to follow\r\nwestward \"the star of empire.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the first English colonies in Maryland were founded, we find in\r\nall the proclamations concerning these settlements by the proprietary\r\ngovernment, that they were limited to \"persons of British or Irish\r\ndescent.\" The religious liberty established in Maryland was the\r\nmagnet which attracted Irish Catholics to that Province, and so they\r\ncame in large numbers in search of peace and comfort and freedom from\r\nthe turmoil produced by religious animosities in their native land.\r\nThe major part of this Irish immigration seems to have come in\r\nthrough the ports of Philadelphia and Charleston and a portion\r\nthrough Chesapeake Bay, whence they passed on to Pennsylvania and the\r\nsouthern colonies.\r\n\r\nThe \"Certificates of Land Grants\" in Maryland show that it was\r\ncustomary for those Irish colonists to name their lands after places\r\nin their native country, and I find that there is hardly a town or\r\ncity in the old Gaelic strongholds in Ireland that is not represented\r\nin the nomenclature of the early Maryland grants. One entire section\r\nof the Province, named the \"County of New Ireland\" by proclamation of\r\nLord Baltimore in the year 1684, was occupied wholly by Irish\r\nfamilies. This section is now embraced in Cecil and Harford Counties.\r\nNew Ireland County was divided into three parts, known as New\r\nConnaught, New Munster, and New Leinster. New Connaught was founded\r\nby George Talbot from Roscommon, who was surveyor-general of the\r\nProvince; New Munster, by Edward O'Dwyer from Tipperary; and New\r\nLeinster, by Bryan O'Daly from Wicklow, all of whom were in Maryland\r\nprior to 1683. Among the prominent men in the Province may be\r\nmentioned Charles O'Carroll, who was secretary to the proprietor;\r\nJohn Hart from county Cavan, who was governor of Maryland from 1714\r\nto 1720; Phillip Conner from Kerry, known in history as the \"Last\r\nCommander of Old Kent\"; Daniel Dulany of the O'Delaney family from\r\nQueen's County, one of the most famous lawyers in the American\r\nColonies; Michael Tawney or Taney, ancestor of the celebrated judge,\r\nRoger Brooke Taney; the Courseys from Cork, one of the oldest\r\nfamilies in the State; the Kings from Dublin; and many others.\r\n\r\nThe only place in the State bearing a genuine Irish name which has\r\nreached any prominence is Baltimore. Not alone has the \"Monumental\r\nCity\" received its name from Ireland, but the tract of land on which\r\nthe city is now situate was originally named (in 1695) \"Ely\r\nO'Carroll,\" after the barony of that name in King's and Tipperary\r\ncounties, the ancient home of the Clan O'Carroll. To subdivisions of\r\nthe tract were given such names as Dublin, Waterford, Tralee, Raphoe,\r\nTramore, Mallow, Kinsale, Lurgan, Coleraine, Tipperary, Antrim,\r\nBelfast, Derry, Kildare, Enniskillen, Wexford, Letterkenny, Lifford,\r\nBirr, Galway, Limerick, and so on, all indicating the nationality of\r\nthe patentees, as well as the places from which they came.\r\n\r\nFrom such sources is the evidence available of the coming of the\r\nIrish to Maryland in large numbers, and so it is that we are not\r\nsurprised to find on the rosters of the Maryland Revolutionary\r\nregiments 4633 distinctive Irish names, exclusive of the large\r\nnumbers who joined the navy and the militia, as well as those who\r\nwere held to guard the frontier from Indian raids, whose names are\r\nnot on record. However, it is not possible now to determine the\r\nproportion of the Revolutionary soldiers who were of Irish birth or\r\ndescent, for where the nationality is not stated in the rosters all\r\nnon-Irish names must be left out of the reckoning. The first census\r\nof Maryland (1790), published by the United States Government,\r\nenumerates the names of all \"Heads of Families\" and the number of\r\npersons in each family. A count of the Irish names shows\r\napproximately 21,000 persons. This does not take into account the\r\ngreat number of people who could not be recorded under that head, as\r\nit is known there were many thousand Irish \"redemptioners\" in\r\nMaryland prior to the taking of the census, and while no precise data\r\nexist to indicate the number of Irish immigrants who settled in\r\nMaryland, I estimate that the number of people of Irish descent in\r\nthe State in 1790 was not far short of 40,000.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Land Records and Council Journals of Georgia of the last half of\r\nthe seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth century afford\r\nlike testimony to the presence of the Irish, who crossed the sea and\r\ncolonized the waste places of that wild territory, and whose\r\ndescendants in after years contributed much of the strength of the\r\npatriot forces who confronted the armed cohorts of Carleton and\r\nCornwallis. From the Colonial Records of Georgia, published under the\r\nauspices of the State Legislature, I have extracted a long list of\r\npeople of Irish name and blood who received grants of land in that\r\ncolony. They came with Oglethorpe as early as 1735 and continued to\r\narrive for many years. It was an Irishman named Mitchell who laid out\r\nthe site of Atlanta, the metropolis of the South; an O'Brien founded\r\nthe city of Augusta; and a McCormick named the city of Dublin,\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the records of the Carolinas we obtain similar data, many of an\r\nabsorbingly interesting character, and the number of places in that\r\nsection bearing names of a decidedly Celtic flavor is striking\r\nevidence of the presence of Irish people, the line of whose\r\nsettlements across the whole State of North Carolina may be traced on\r\nthe high roads leading from Pennsylvania and Virginia. Hawk, one of\r\nthe historians of North Carolina, refers to the \"Irish Romanists\" who\r\nwere resident in that Province as early as 1700, and Williamson says\r\nthat \"the most numerous settlers in the northwestern part of the\r\nProvince during the first half of the eighteenth century were from\r\nIreland.\" The manuscript records in the office of the Secretary of\r\nState refer to \"a ship load of immigrants\" who, in the year 1761,\r\ncame to the Carolinas from Dublin. The names of the Irish pioneers in\r\nthe Carolinas are found in every conceivable connection, in the\r\nparochial and court records, in the will books, in the minutes of the\r\ngeneral Assembly, in the quaint old records of the Land and\r\nRegisters' offices, in the patents granted by the colonial\r\nGovernment, and in sundry other official records. In public affairs\r\nthey seem to have had the same adaptability for politics which, among\r\nother things, has in later days brought their countrymen into\r\nprominence. Florence O'Sullivan from Kerry was surveyor-general of\r\nSouth Carolina in 1671. James Moore, a native of Ireland and a\r\ndescendant of the famous Irish chieftain, Rory O'More, was governor\r\nof South Carolina in 1700; Matthew Rowan from Carrickfergus was\r\npresident of the North Carolina Council during the term of office of\r\nhis townsman, Governor Arthur Dobbs (1754 to 1764); John Connor was\r\nattorney-general of the Province in 1730, and was succeeded in turn\r\nby David O'Sheall and Thomas McGuire. Cornelius Hartnett, Hugh\r\nWaddell, and Terence Sweeny, all Irishmen, were members of the Court,\r\nand among the members of the provincial assembly I find such names as\r\nMurphy, Leary, Kearney, McLewean, Dunn, Keenan, McManus, Ryan,\r\nBourke, Logan, and others showing an Irish origin. And, in this\r\nconnection, we must not overlook Thomas Burke, a native of \"the City\r\nof the Tribes\", distinguished as lawyer, soldier, and statesman, who\r\nbecame governor of North Carolina in 1781, as did his cousin Aedanus\r\nBurke, also from Galway, who was judge of the Supreme Court of South\r\nCarolina in 1778. John Rutledge, son of Dr. John Rutledge from\r\nIreland, was governor of South Carolina in 1776 and his brother\r\nEdward became governor of the State in 1788.\r\n\r\nBut there were Irishmen in the Carolinas long before the advent of\r\nthese, and indeed Irish names are found occasionally as far back as\r\nthe records of those colonies reach. They are scattered profusely\r\nthrough the will books and records of deeds as early as 1676 and down\r\nto the end of the century, and in a list of immigrants from Barbados\r\nin the year 1678, quoted by John Camden Hotten in the work already\r\nalluded to, we find about 120 persons of Irish name who settled in\r\nthe Carolinas in that year. In 1719, 500 persons from Ireland\r\ntransported themselves to Carolina to take the benefit of an Act\r\npassed by the Assembly by which the lands of the Yemmassee Indians\r\nwere thrown open to settlers, and Ramsay (_History of South\r\nCarolina_, vol. I, page 20) says: \"Of all countries none has\r\nfurnished the Province with so many inhabitants as Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Pennsylvania records one is also struck with the very frequent\r\nmention of Irish names. William Penn had lived in Ireland for several\r\nyears and was acquainted with the sturdy character of its people, and\r\nwhen he arrived on board _The Welcome_ in 1682 he had with him a\r\nnumber of Irishmen, who are described as \"people of property and\r\npeople of consequence.\" In 1699 he brought over a brilliant young\r\nIrishman, James Logan from Lurgan, who for nearly half a century\r\noccupied a leading position in the Province and for some time was its\r\ngovernor. But the first Irish immigration to Pennsylvania of any\r\nnumerical importance came in the year 1717. They settled in Lancaster\r\nCounty. \"They and their descendants,\" says Rupp, an impartial\r\nhistorian, \"have always been justly regarded as among the most\r\nintelligent people in the County and their progress will be found to\r\nbe but little behind the boasted efforts of the Colony of Plymouth.\"\r\nIn 1727, as the records show, 1155 Irish people arrived in\r\nPhiladelphia and in 1728 the number reached the high total of 5600.\r\n\"It looks as if Ireland is to send all her inhabitants hither,\" wrote\r\nSecretary Logan to the provincial proprietors in 1729, \"for last week\r\nnot less than six ships arrived. The common fear is that if they\r\ncontinue to come they will make themselves proprietors of the\r\nProvince\" (Rupp's _History of Dauphin County_).\r\n\r\nThe continuous stream of Irish immigration was viewed with so much\r\nalarm by the Legislature, that in 1728 a law was passed \"against\r\nthese crowds of Irish papists and convicts who are yearly powr'd upon\r\nus\"--(the \"convicts\" being the political refugees who fled from the\r\npersecutions of the English Government!). But the operations of this\r\nstatute were wholly nullified by the captains of the vessels landing\r\ntheir passengers at Newcastle, Del., and Burlington, N, J., and, as\r\none instance of this, I find in the Philadelphia _American Weekly\r\nMercury_ of August 14, 1729, a statement to this effect: \"It is\r\nreported from Newcastle that there arrived there this last week about\r\n2000 Irish and an abundance more daily expected.\" This expectation\r\nwas realized, for according to \"An Account of Passengers and Servants\r\nlanded in Philadelphia between December 25, 1728, and December 25,\r\n1729\", which I find in the _New England Weekly Journal_ for March 30,\r\n1730, the number of Irish who came in via the Delaware river in that\r\nyear was 5655, while the total number of all other Europeans who\r\narrived during the same period was only 553. Holmes, in his _Annals\r\nof America_, corroborates this. The Philadelphia newspapers down to\r\nthe year 1741 also contained many similar references, indicating that\r\nthe flood of Irish immigration was unceasing and that it was at all\r\ntimes in excess of that from other European countries. Later issues\r\nof the _Mercury_ also published accounts of the number of ships from\r\nIreland which arrived in the Delaware, and from these it appears that\r\nfrom 1735 to 1738 \"66 vessels entered Philadelphia from Ireland and\r\n50 cleared thereto.\" And in the _New York Gazette and Weekly\r\nPost-Boy_ of the years 1750 to 1752, I find under the caption,\r\n\"Vessels Registered at the Philadelphia Custom House,\" a total of 183\r\nships destined from or to Ireland, or an average of five sailings per\r\nmonth between Irish ports and the port of Philadelphia alone. A\r\ncareful search fails to disclose any record of the number of persons\r\nwho came in these ships, but, from the fact that it is stated that\r\nall carried passengers as well as merchandise from Irish ports, we\r\nmay safely assume that the \"human freight\" must have been very large.\r\n\r\nSpencer, in his _History of the United States_, says: \"In the years\r\n1771 and 1772 the number of emigrants to America from Ireland was\r\n17,350, almost all of whom emigrated at their own expense. A great\r\nmajority of them consisted of persons employed in the linen\r\nmanufacture or farmers possessed of some property, which they\r\nconverted into money and brought with them. Within the first\r\nfortnight of August, 1773, there arrived at Philadelphia 3500\r\nimmigrants from Ireland. As most of the emigrants, particularly those\r\nfrom Ireland and Scotland, were personally discontent with their\r\ntreatment in Europe, their accession to the colonial population, it\r\nmight reasonably be supposed, had no tendency to diminish or\r\ncounteract the hostile sentiments toward Britain which were daily\r\ngathering force in America.\" Marmion, in his _Ancient and Modern\r\nHistory of the Maritime Ports of Ireland_, verifies this. He says\r\nthat the number of Irish who came during the years 1771, 1772, and\r\n1773 was 25,000. The bulk of these came in by way of Philadelphia and\r\nsettled in Pennsylvania and the Virginias.\r\n\r\nThe Irish were arriving in the Province in such great numbers during\r\nthis period as to be the cause of considerable jealousy on the part\r\nof other settlers from continental Europe. They were a vigorous and\r\naggressive element. Eager for that freedom which was denied them at\r\nhome, large numbers of them went out on the frontier. While the\r\nwar-whoop of the savage still echoed within the surrounding valleys\r\nand his council fires blazed upon the hills, those daring adventurers\r\npenetrated the hitherto pathless wilderness and passed through\r\nunexampled hardships with heroic endurance. They opened up the roads,\r\nbridged the streams, and cut down the forests, turning the wilderness\r\ninto a place fit for man's abode. With their sturdy sons, they\r\nconstituted the skirmish line of civilization, standing as a bulwark\r\nagainst Indian incursions into the more prosperous and populous\r\nsettlements between them and the coast. From 1740 down to the period\r\nof the Revolution, hardly a year passed without a fresh infusion of\r\nIrish blood into the existing population, and, as an indication that\r\nthey distributed themselves all over the Province, I find, in every\r\nTown and County history of Pennsylvania and in the land records of\r\nevery section, Irish names in the greatest profusion. They settled in\r\ngreat numbers chiefly along the Susquehanna and its tributaries; they\r\nlaid out many prosperous settlements in the wilderness of western\r\nPennsylvania, and in these sections Irishmen are seen occupying some\r\nof the foremost and most coveted positions, and their sons in after\r\nyears contributed much to the power and commercial greatness of the\r\nCommonwealth. They are mentioned prominently as manufacturers,\r\nmerchants, and farmers, and in the professions they occupied a place\r\nsecond to none among the natives of the State. In several sections,\r\nthey were numerous enough to establish their own independent\r\nsettlements, to which they gave the names of their Irish home places,\r\nseveral of which are preserved to this day. It is not to be wondered\r\nat then that General Harry Lee named the Pennsylvania line of the\r\nContinental army, \"the Line of Ireland\"!\r\n\r\nIreland gave many eminent men to the Commonwealth, among whom may be\r\nmentioned: John Burns, its first governor after the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, who was born in Dublin; George Bryan, also a native of\r\nDublin, who was its governor in 1788; James O'Hara, one of the\r\nfounders of Pittsburgh; Thomas FitzSimmons, a native of Limerick,\r\nmember of the first Congress under the Constitution which began the\r\nUnited States Government and father of the policy of protection to\r\nAmerican industries; Matthew Carey from Dublin, the famous political\r\neconomist; and many others who were prominent as nation-builders in\r\nthe early days of the \"Keystone State.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile the historians usually give all the credit to England and to\r\nEnglishmen for the early colonization of New England, whose results\r\nhave been attended with such important consequences to America and\r\nthe civilized world, Ireland and her sons can also claim a large part\r\nin the development of this territory, as is evidenced by the town,\r\nland, church, and other colonial records, and the names of the\r\npioneers, as well as the names given to several of the early\r\nsettlements. That the Irish had been coming to New England almost\r\nfrom the beginning of the English colonization is indicated by an\r\n\"Order\" entered in the Massachusetts record under date of September\r\n25, 1634, granting liberty to \"the Scottishe and Irishe gentlemen who\r\nintend to come hither, to sitt down in any place upp Merimacke\r\nriver.\" This, doubtless, referred to a Scotch and Irish company\r\nwhich, about that time, had announced its intention of founding a\r\nsettlement on the Merrimac. It comprised in all 140 passengers, who\r\nembarked in the _Eagle Wing_, from Carrickfergus in September, 1636,\r\nbringing with them a considerable quantity of equipment and\r\nmerchandise to meet the exigencies of their settlement in the new\r\ncountry. The vessel, however, never reached its destination and was\r\nobliged to return to Ireland on account of the Atlantic storms, and\r\nthere is no record of a renewal of the attempt. In the Massachusetts\r\nrecords of the year 1640 (vol. I, p. 295) is another entry relating\r\nto \"the persons come from Ireland,\" and in the Town Books of Boston\r\nmay be seen references to Irishmen who were residents of the town in\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nFrom local histories, which in many cases are but verbatim copies of\r\nthe original entries in the Town Books, we get occasional glimpses of\r\nthe Irish who were in the colony of Massachusetts Bay between this\r\nperiod and the end of the century. For example, between 1640 and\r\n1660, such names as O'Neill, Sexton, Gibbons, Lynch, Keeney, Kelly,\r\nand Hogan appear on the Town records of Hartford, and one of the\r\nfirst schoolmasters who taught the children of the Puritans in New\r\nHaven was an Irishman named William Collins, who, in the year 1640,\r\ncame there with a number of Irish refugees from Barbados Island. An\r\nIrishman named Joseph Collins with his wife and family came to Lynn,\r\nMass., in 1635. Richard Duffy and Matthias Curran were at Ipswich in\r\n1633. John Kelly came to Newbury in 1635 with the first English\r\nsettlers of the town. David O'Killia (or O'Kelly) was a resident of\r\nOld Yarmouth in 1657, and I find on various records of that section a\r\ngreat number of people named Kelley, who probably were descended from\r\nDavid O'Killia. Peter O'Kelly and his family are mentioned as of\r\nDorchester in 1696. At Springfield in 1656 there were families named\r\nRiley and O'Dea; and Richard Burke, said to be of the Mayo family of\r\nthat name, is mentioned prominently in Middlesex County as early as\r\n1670. The first legal instrument of record in Hampden County was a\r\ndeed of conveyance in the year 1683 to one Patrick Riley of lands in\r\nChicopee. With a number of his countrymen, Riley located in this\r\nvicinity and gave the name of \"Ireland Parish\" to their settlement.\r\nJohn Molooney and Daniel MacGuinnes were at Woburn in 1676, and\r\nMichael Bacon, \"an Irishman\", of Woburn, fought in King Philip's war\r\nin 1675. John Joyce was at Lynn in 1637, and I find the names of\r\nWillyam Heally, William Reyle, William Barrett, and Roger Burke\r\nsigned to a petition to the General Court of Massachusetts on August\r\n17, 1664. Such names as Maccarty, Gleason, Coggan, Lawler, Kelly,\r\nHurley, MackQuade, and McCleary also appear on the Cambridge Church\r\nrecords down to 1690. These are but desultory instances of the first\r\ncomers among the Irish to Massachusetts, selected from a great mass\r\nof similar data.\r\n\r\nIn the early history of every town in Massachusetts, without\r\nexception, I find mention of Irish people, and while the majority\r\ncame originally as \"poor redemptioners\", yet, in course of time and\r\ndespite Puritanical prejudices, not a few of them rose to positions\r\nof worth and independence. Perhaps the most noted of these was\r\nMatthew Lyon of Vermont, known as \"the Hampden of Congress,\" who, on\r\nhis arrival in New York in 1765, was sold as a \"redemptioner\" to pay\r\nhis passage-money. This distinguished American was a native of county\r\nWicklow. Other notable examples of Irish redemptioners who attained\r\neminence in America were George Taylor, a native of Dublin, one of\r\nPennsylvania's signers of the Declaration of Independence; Charles\r\nThompson, a native of county Tyrone, \"the perennial Secretary of the\r\nContinental Congress\", and William Killen, who became chief justice\r\nand chancellor of Delaware. Some of the descendants of the Irish\r\nredemptioners in Massachusetts are found among the prominent New\r\nEnglanders of the past hundred years. The Puritans of Massachusetts\r\nextended no welcoming hand to the Irish who had the temerity to come\r\namong them, yet, as an historical writer has truly said, \"by one of\r\nthose strange transformations which time occasionally works, it has\r\ncome to pass that Massachusetts today contains more people of Irish\r\nblood in proportion to the total population than any other State in\r\nthe Union.\"\r\n\r\nSo great and so continuous was Irish immigration to Massachusetts\r\nduring the early part of the eighteenth century that on Saint\r\nPatrick's Day in the year 1737 a number of merchants, who described\r\nthemselves as \"of the Irish Nation residing in Boston,\" formed the\r\nCharitable Irish Society, an organization which exists even to the\r\npresent day. It was provided that the officers should be \"natives of\r\nIreland or of Irish extraction,\" and they announced that the Society\r\nwas organized \"in an affectionate and Compassionate concern for their\r\ncountrymen in these Parts who may be reduced by Sickness, Shipwrack,\r\nOld Age, and other Infirmities and unforeseen Accidents.\" I have\r\ncopied from the Town Books, as reproduced by the City of Boston, 1600\r\nIrish names of persons who were married or had declared their\r\nintentions of marriage in Boston between the years 1710 and 1790,\r\nexclusive of 956 other Irish names which appear on the minutes\r\nbetween 1720 and 1775.\r\n\r\nIn 1718, one of the largest single colonies of Irish arrived in\r\nBoston. It consisted of one hundred families, who settled at\r\ndifferent places in Massachusetts. One contingent, headed by Edward\r\nFitzgerald, located at Worcester and another at Palmer under the\r\nleadership of Robert Farrell, while a number went to the already\r\nestablished settlement at Londonderry, N.H. About the same time a\r\ncolony of fishermen from the west coast of Ireland settled on the\r\nCape Cod peninsula, and I find a number of them recorded on the\r\nmarriage registers of the towns in this vicinity between 1719 and\r\n1743. In 1720, a number of families from county Tyrone came to\r\nShrewsbury, and eight years later another large contingent came to\r\nLeicester County from the same neighborhood, who gave the name of\r\nDublin to the section where they located. The annals of Leicester\r\nCounty are rich in Irish names. On the Town Books of various places\r\nin this vicinity and on the rosters of the troops enrolled for the\r\nIndian war, Irishmen are recorded, and we learn from the records that\r\nnot a few of them were important and useful men, active in the\r\ndevelopment of the settlements, and often chosen as selectmen or\r\nrepresentatives. On the minutes of the meetings of the selectmen of\r\nPelham, Spencer, Sutton, Charlestown, Canton, Scituate, Stoughton,\r\nSalem, Amesbury, Stoneham, and other Massachusetts towns, Irish names\r\nare recorded many years before the Revolution. In local histories\r\nthese people are usually called \"Scotch-Irish,\" a racial misnomer\r\nthat has been very much overworked by a certain class of historical\r\nwriters who seem to be unable to understand that a non-Catholic\r\nnative of Ireland can be an Irishman. In an exhaustive study of\r\nAmerican history, I cannot find any other race where such a\r\ndistinction is drawn as in the case of the non-Catholic, or so-called\r\n\"Scotch,\" Irish. In many instances, this hybrid racial designation\r\nobviously springs from prejudice and a desire to withhold from\r\nIreland any credit that may belong to her, although, in some cases,\r\nthe writers are genuinely mistaken in their belief that the Scotch as\r\na race are the antithesis of the Irish and that whatever commendable\r\nqualities the non-Catholic Irish are possessed of naturally spring\r\nfrom the Scotch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first recorded Irish settlement in Maine was made by families\r\nnamed Kelly and Haley from Galway, who located on the Isles of Shoals\r\nabout the year 1653. In 1692, Roger Kelly was a representative from\r\nthe Isles to the General Court of Massachusetts, and is described in\r\nlocal annals as \"King of the Isles.\" The large number of islands,\r\nbays, and promontories on the Maine coast bearing distinctive Celtic\r\nnames attests the presence and influence of Irish people in this\r\nsection in colonial times. In 1720, Robert Temple from Cork brought\r\nto Maine five shiploads of people, mostly from the province of\r\nMunster. They landed at the junction of the Kennebec and Eastern\r\nrivers, where they established the town of Cork, which, however,\r\nafter a precarious existence of only six years, was entirely\r\ndestroyed by the Indians. For nearly a century the place was\r\nfamiliarly known to the residents of the locality as \"Ireland.\" The\r\nrecords of York, Lincoln, and Cumberland counties contain references\r\nto large numbers of Irish people who settled in those localities\r\nduring the early years of the eighteenth century. The Town Books of\r\nGeorgetown, Kirtery, and Kennebunkport, of the period 1740 to 1775,\r\nare especially rich in Irish names, and in the Saco Valley numerous\r\nsettlements were made by Irish immigrants, not a few of whom are\r\nreferred to by local historians as \"men of wealth and social\r\nstanding.\" In the marriage and other records of Limerick, Me., as\r\npublished by the Maine Historical and Genealogical Recorder, in the\r\nmarriage registers of the First Congregational Church of Scarborough,\r\nand in other similarly unquestionable records, I find a surprisingly\r\nlarge number of Irish names at various periods during the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries. In fact, there is not one town in the\r\nProvince that did not have its quota of Irish people, who came either\r\ndirect from Ireland or migrated from other sections of New England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe records of New Hampshire and Rhode Island are also a fruitful\r\nsource of information on this subject, and the Provincial papers\r\nindicate an almost unbroken tide of Irish immigration to this\r\nsection, beginning as early as the year 1640. One of the most noted\r\nof Exeter's pioneer settlers was an Irishman named Darby Field, who\r\ncame to that place in 1631 and who has been credited by Governor\r\nWinthrop as \"the first European who witnessed the White Mountains.\"\r\nHe is also recorded as \"an Irish soldier for discovery,\" and I find\r\nhis name in the annals of Exeter as one of the grantees of an Indian\r\ndeed dated April 3, 1638, as well as several other Irish names down\r\nto the year 1664. In examining the town registers, gazeteers, and\r\ngenealogies, as well as the local histories of New Hampshire, in\r\nwhich are embodied copies of the original entries made by the Town\r\nClerks, I find numerous references to the Irish pioneers, and in many\r\ninstances they are written down, among others, as \"the first\r\nsettlers.\" Some are mentioned as selectmen, town clerks,\r\nrepresentatives, or colonial soldiers, and it is indeed remarkable\r\nthat there is not one of these authorities that I have examined, out\r\nof more than two hundred, that does not contain Irish names. From\r\nthese Irish pioneers sprang many men who attained prominence in New\r\nHampshire, in the legislature, the professions, the military, the\r\narts and crafts, and in all departments of civil life, down to the\r\npresent time. In the marriage registers of Portsmouth, Boscawen, New\r\nBoston, Antrim, Londonderry, and other New Hampshire towns, are\r\nrecorded, in some cases as early as 1716, names of Irish persons,\r\nwith the places of their nativity, indicating that they came from all\r\nparts of Ireland. At Hampton, I find Humphrey Sullivan teaching\r\nschool in 1714, while the name of John Sullivan from Limerick,\r\nschoolmaster at Dover and at Berwick, Me., for upwards of fifty\r\nyears, is one of the most honored in early New Hampshire history.\r\n\r\nThis John Sullivan was surely one of the grandest characters in the\r\nColony of Massachusetts Bay, and the record of his descendants serves\r\nas an all-sufficient reply to the anti-Irish prejudices of some\r\nAmerican historians. He was the father of a governor of New Hampshire\r\nand of a governor of Massachusetts; of an attorney-general of New\r\nHampshire and of an attorney-general of Massachusetts; of New\r\nHampshire's only major-general in the Continental army; of the first\r\njudge appointed by Washington in New Hampshire; and of four sons who\r\nwere officers in the Continental army. He was grandfather of an\r\nattorney-general of New Hampshire, of a governor of Maine, and of a\r\nUnited States Senator from New Hampshire. He was great-grandfather of\r\nan attorney-general of New Hampshire, and great-great-grandfather of\r\nan officer in the Thirteenth New Hampshire regiment in the Civil War.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Rhode Island, Irish people are on record as far back as 1640, and\r\nfor many years after that date they continued to come. Edward Larkin\r\nwas an esteemed citizen of Newport in 1655. Charles McCarthy was one\r\nof the founders of the town of East Greenwich in 1677, while in this\r\nvicinity as early as 1680 are found such names as Casey, Higgins,\r\nMagennis, Kelley, Murphy, Reylie, Maloney, Healy, Delaney, Walsh, and\r\nothers of Irish origin. On the rosters of the Colonial militia who\r\nfought in King Philip's war (1675) are found the names of 110\r\nsoldiers of Irish birth or descent, some of whom, for their services\r\nat the battle of Narragansett, received grants of land in New\r\nHampshire and Massachusetts. The New England Historical and\r\nGenealogical Register for 1848 contains some remarkable testimony of\r\nthe sympathy of the people of Ireland for the sufferers in this cruel\r\nwar, and the \"Irish Donation,\" sent out from Dublin in the year 1676,\r\nwill always stand in history to Ireland's credit and as an instance\r\nof her intimate familiarity with American affairs, one hundred years\r\nprior to that Revolution which emancipated the people of this land\r\nfrom the same tyranny under which she herself has groaned. And yet,\r\nwhat a cruel travesty on history it reads like now, when we scan the\r\nofficial records of the New England colonies and find that the Irish\r\nwere often called \"convicts\", and it was thought that measures should\r\nbe taken to prevent their landing on the soil where they and their\r\nsons afterwards shed their blood in the cause of their fellow\r\ncolonists! In the minutes of the provincial Assemblies and in the\r\nreports rendered to the General Court, as well as in other official\r\ndocuments of the period, are found expressions of the sentiment which\r\nprevailed against the natives of the \"Island of Sorrows.\" Only twenty\r\nyears before the outbreak of King Philip's war, the government of\r\nEngland was asked to provide a law \"to prevent the importation of\r\nIrish Papists and convicts that are yearly pow'rd upon us and to make\r\nprovision against the growth of this pernicious evil.\" And the\r\ncolonial Courts themselves, on account of what they called \"the cruel\r\nand malignant spirit that has from time to time been manifest in the\r\nIrish nation against the English nation,\" prohibited \"the bringing\r\nover of any Irish men, women, or children into this jurisdiction on\r\nthe penalty of fifty pounds sterling to each inhabitant who shall buy\r\nof any merchant, shipmaster, or other agent any such person or\r\npersons so transported by them.\" This order was promulgated by the\r\nGeneral Court of Massachusetts in October, 1654, and is given in full\r\nin the American Historical Review for October, 1896.\r\n\r\nWith the \"convicts\" and the \"redemptioners\" came the Irish\r\nschoolmaster, the man then most needed in America. And the fighting\r\nman, he too was to the fore, for when the colonies in after years\r\ncalled for volunteers to resist the tyranny of the British, the\r\ndescendants of the Irish \"convicts\" were among the first and the most\r\neager to answer the call.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough it does not appear that Irish immigrants settled in the\r\nProvince of New York in such large numbers as in other sections, yet,\r\nas far back as the third quarter of the seventeenth century, Irish\r\nnames are found on the records of the Colony. O'Callaghan, the\r\neminent archivist and historian, refers to \"Dr. William Hayes,\r\nformerly of Barry's Court, Ireland,\" as one of New York's physicians\r\nin the year 1647, and from the same authority we learn that there\r\nwere \"settlers and Indian fighters in New Netherland\" named Barrett,\r\nFitzgerald, Dowdall, Collins, and Quinn in 1657. In records relating\r\nto the war with the Esopus Indians (1663), and in fact as early as\r\n1658, frequent references are made to \"Thomas the Irishman\", whose\r\nname was Thomas Lewis, a refugee from Ireland to Holland after the\r\nCromwellian war. Lewis is on record in 1683 as one of the wealthiest\r\nmerchants of New York and a large owner of real estate in the present\r\ndowntown portion of the city. Such names as Patrick Hayes, John Daly,\r\nJohn Quigly, and Dennis McKarty appear among its business men between\r\n1666 and 1672, and in a \"Census of the City of New York of the year\r\n1703\" we find people named Flynn, Walsh, Dooley, Gillen, Carroll,\r\nKenne, Gurney, Hart, Mooney, Moran, Lynch, Kearney, and others, all\r\n\"Freemen of the City of New York.\" In the \"Poll List\" of the city\r\nfrom 1741 to 1761, more than one hundred such names appear, while\r\namong the advertisers in the New York newspapers all through the\r\neighteenth century I find a large number of characteristic Irish\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nOne would scarcely expect to find an Irishman in the old Dutch\r\nsettlement of Beverwyck as early as 1645. Yet such is the case, for\r\n\"Jan Andriessen, de Iersman van Dublingh\"--(John Anderson, the\r\nIrishman from Dublin)--is mentioned as the owner of considerable\r\nlanded property in the neighborhood of Albany and Catskill, and in\r\nevery mention of this ancient pioneer he is referred to as \"the\r\nIrishman.\" At Albany, between 1666 and 1690, we find people named\r\nConnell, Daly, Larkin, Shaw, Hogan, and Finn, all Irishmen, and in\r\nJonathan Pearson's \"Genealogies of the First Settlers of the Ancient\r\nCounty of Albany\" and in his \"Genealogies of the First Settlers of\r\nthe Patent and City of Schenectady\", I find 135 distinctive Irish\r\nnames. These were mostly merchants, farmers, artisans, millers, and\r\nbackwoodsmen, the pioneers, who, with their Dutch neighbors, blazed\r\nthe trail of civilization through that section, rolled back the\r\nsavage redman, and marked along the banks of the Hudson and Mohawk\r\nrivers the sites of future towns and cities. In the rate lists of\r\nLong Island between 1638 and 1675, I find Kelly, Dalton, Whelan,\r\nCondon, Barry, Powers, Quin, Kane, Sweeney, Murphy, Reilly, as well\r\nas Norman-Irish and Anglo-Irish names that are common to Irish\r\nnomenclature. Hugh O'Neale was a prominent resident of Newtown, L.I.,\r\nin 1655. In a \"Report to the Lord President,\" dated September 6,\r\n1687, Governor Dongan recommended \"that natives of Ireland be sent to\r\ncolonize here where they may live and be very happy.\" Numbers of them\r\nevidently accepted the invitation, for many Irishmen are mentioned in\r\nthe public documents of the Province during the succeeding twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThat the Irish continued to settle in the Province all through the\r\neighteenth century may be seen from the announcements in the New York\r\nnewspapers of the time and other authentic records. The most\r\nimportant of these, in point of numbers and character of the\r\nimmigrants, were those made in Orange County in 1729 under the\r\nleadership of James Clinton from Longford, and at Cherry Valley, in\r\nOtsego County, twelve years later. On the Orange County assessment\r\nand Revolutionary rolls, and down to the year 1800, there is a very\r\nlarge number of Irish names, and in some sections they constituted\r\nnearly the entire population. In the northwestern part of New York,\r\nIrishmen are also found about the time of the Franco-English war.\r\nThey were not only among those settlers who followed the peaceful\r\npursuits of tilling and building, but they were \"the men behind the\r\nguns\" who held the marauding Indians in check and repelled the\r\nadvances of the French through that territory. In this war, Irish\r\nsoldiers fought on both sides, and in the \"Journals of the Marquis of\r\nMontcalm\" may be seen references to the English garrison at Oswego,\r\nwhich, in August, 1756, surrendered to that same Irish Brigade by\r\nwhich they had been defeated eleven years before on the battlefield\r\nof Fontenoy. In the \"Manuscripts of Sir William Johnson\", are also\r\nfound some interesting items indicating that Irishmen were active\r\nparticipants in the frontier fighting about that time, and in one\r\nreport to him, dated May 28, 1756, from the commandant of an English\r\nregiment, reference is made to \"the great numbers of Irish Papists\r\namong the Delaware and Susquehanna Indians who have done a world of\r\nprejudice to English interests.\"\r\n\r\nThe early records, with hardly an exception, contain Irish names,\r\nshowing that the \"Exiles from Erin\" came to the Province of New York\r\nin considerable numbers during the eighteenth century. The baptismal\r\nand marriage records of the Dutch Reformed and Protestant churches of\r\nNew York City; of the Dutch churches at Kingston, Albany,\r\nSchenectady, and other towns; the muster rolls of the troops enrolled\r\nfor the French, Indian, and Revolutionary wars; the Land Grants and\r\nother provincial records at Albany; the newspapers; the Town, County,\r\nand family histories, and other early chronicles, supplemented by\r\nauthoritative publications such as those of the New York Historical\r\nand Genealogical and Biographical Societies--these are the\r\ndepositories of the evidence that thousands of Irish people settled\r\nin the Province of New York and constituted no inconsiderable\r\nproportion of the total population.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Irish residents of New York whose marriages are\r\nrecorded in the Dutch Reformed church were, doubtless, of the\r\nCatholic faith, but, as it was necessary to comply with the\r\nestablished law, and also so that their offspring might be\r\nlegitimate, they could be bound in wedlock only by a recognized\r\nMinister of the Gospel. As there was no Catholic church in New York\r\nprior to 1786, the ceremony had to be performed in the Dutch Reformed\r\nor Protestant church. Many of these Catholics were refugees from\r\nIreland on account of the religious persecutions. Like the people of\r\nIreland in all ages, they were devoted to their religion, and while,\r\nno doubt, they eschewed for a while association with the established\r\nchurches, yet, as time went on, they and their children were\r\ngradually drawn into religious intercourse with the other sects,\r\nuntil eventually they became regular communicants of those churches.\r\nThe variations which from time to time were wrought in their names\r\nbrought them further and further away from what they had been; in\r\ntheir new surroundings, both social and religious, they themselves\r\nchanged, so that their children, who in many cases married into the\r\nneighboring Dutch and French families, became as wholly un-Irish in\r\nmanner and sentiment as if they had sprung from an entirely different\r\nrace. That fact, however, does not admit of their being now included\r\nin the category \"Anglo-Saxon.\"\r\n\r\nIn a work entitled \"Names of Persons for whom Marriage Licenses were\r\nissued by the Secretary of the Province of New York, previous to\r\n1784,\" compiled by Gideon J. Tucker (when Secretary of State), and\r\ntaken from the early records of the office of the Secretary of State\r\nat Albany, we find ample corroboration of the church records. Page\r\nafter page of this book looks more like some record of the Province\r\nof Munster than of the Province of New York. It is a quarto volume\r\nprinted in small type in double columns, and there are eleven pages\r\nwholly devoted to persons whose names commence with \"Mac\" and three\r\nto the \"O's.\" Nearly every name common to Ireland is here\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nNew York, as a Province and as a State, is much indebted to Irish\r\ngenius. Ireland gave the Province its most noted governor in the\r\nperson of Thomas Dongan from Co. Kildare, and in later years Sir\r\nWilliam Johnson from Co. Meath, governor of the Indians from New York\r\nto the Mississippi. It gave the State its first governor, George\r\nClinton, son of an immigrant from Co. Longford, and to the city its\r\nfirst mayor after the Revolution, James Duane, son of Anthony Duane\r\nfrom Co. Galway. Fulton, an Irishman's son, gave America priority in\r\nthe \"conquest of the seas.\" Christopher Colles, a native of Cork, was\r\nthe originator of the grand scheme which united the waters of the\r\nAtlantic and the Lakes--one of the greatest works of internal\r\nimprovement ever effected in the United States--while the gigantic\r\nproject was carried to a successful end through the influence and\r\ndirection of Governor DeWitt Clinton, the grandson of an Irishman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany of the pioneer settlers of New Jersey were Irish. As early as\r\n1683 \"a colony from Tipperary in Ireland\" located at Cohansey in\r\nSalem County, and in the same year a number of settlers, also\r\ndescribed as \"from Tipperary, Ireland,\" located in Monmouth County.\r\nIn the County records of New Jersey, Irish names are met with\r\nfrequently between the years 1676 and 1698. Several of the local\r\nhistorians testify to the presence and influence of Irishmen in the\r\nearly days of the colony, and in the voluminous \"New Jersey Archives\"\r\nmay be found references to the large numbers of Irish\r\n\"redemptioners,\" some of whom, after their terms of service had\r\nexpired, received grants of land and in time became prosperous\r\nfarmers and merchants. Perhaps the most noted Irishman in New Jersey\r\nin colonial days was Michael Kearney, a native of Cork and ancestor\r\nof General Philip Kearney of Civil War fame, who was secretary and\r\ntreasurer of the Province in 1723.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll through the west and southwest, Irishmen are found in the\r\nearliest days of authentic history. Along the Ohio, Kentucky, Wabash,\r\nand Tennessee rivers they were with the pioneers who first trod the\r\nwilderness of that vast territory. As early as 1690, an Irish trader\r\nnamed Doherty crossed the mountains into what is now Kentucky, and we\r\nare told by Filson, the noted French historian and explorer of\r\nKentucky, that \"the first white man who discovered this region\"\r\n(1754) was one James McBride, who, in all probability, was an\r\nIrishman. The first white child born in Cincinnati was a son of an\r\nIrish settler named John Cummins; the first house built on its site\r\nwas erected by Captain Hugh McGarry, while \"the McGarrys, Dentons,\r\nand Hogans formed the first domestic circle in Kentucky.\" Prior to\r\nthe Revolution, Indian traders from Western Pennsylvania had\r\npenetrated into this region, and we learn from authentic sources that\r\nno small percentage of those itinerant merchants of the west were\r\nIrishmen. Among the leading and earliest colonists of the \"Blue Grass\r\nState\" who accompanied Daniel Boone, the ubiquitous Irish were\r\nrepresented by men bearing such names as Mooney, McManus, Sullivan,\r\nDrennon, Logan, Casey, Fitzpatrick, Dunlevy, Cassidy, Doran,\r\nDougherty, Lynch, Ryan, McNeill, McGee, Reilly, Flinn, and the noted\r\nMcAfee brothers, all natives of Ireland or sons of Irish immigrants.\r\n\r\nIrishmen and their sons figured prominently in the field of early\r\nwestern politics. In the Kentucky legislature, I find such names as\r\nConnor, Cassidy, Cleary, Conway, Casey, Cavan, Dulin, Dougherty,\r\nGeohegan, Maher, Morrison, Moran, McMahon, McFall, McClanahan,\r\nO'Bannon, Powers, and a number of others evidently of Irish origin.\r\nOn the bench we find O'Hara, Boyle, and Barry. Among the many\r\ndistinguished men who reflected honor upon the west, Judge William T.\r\nBarry of Lexington ranks high for great ability and lofty virtues.\r\nSimon Kenton, famed in song and story, who \"battled with the Indians\r\nin a hundred encounters and wrested Kentucky from the savage,\" was an\r\nIrishman's son, while among its famous Indian fighters were Colonels\r\nAndrew Hynes, William Casey, and John O'Bannon; Majors Bulger,\r\nMcMullin, McGarry, McBride, Butler, and Cassidy; and Captains\r\nMcMahon, Malarkie, Doyle, Phelon, and Brady. Allen, Butler, Campbell,\r\nMontgomery, and Rowan counties, Ky., are named after natives of\r\nIreland, and Boyle, Breckinridge, Carroll, Casey, Daviess, Magoffin,\r\nKenton, McCracken, Meade, Menifee, Clinton, and Fulton counties were\r\nnamed in honor of descendants of Irish settlers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the councils of the first territorial legislature of Missouri were\r\nSullivan, Cassidy, Murphy, McDermid, McGrady, Flaugherty, McGuire,\r\nDunn, and Hogan, and among the merchants, lawyers, and bankers in the\r\npioneer days of St. Louis there were a number of Irishmen, the most\r\nnoted of whom were Mullanphy, Gilhuly, O'Fallon, Connor, O'Hara,\r\nDillon, Ranken, Magennis, and Walsh. In all early histories of\r\nMissouri towns and counties, Irish names are mentioned, and in many\r\ninstances they are on record as \"the first settlers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so it was all through the west. In Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, and\r\nIllinois, across the rolling prairies and the mountains, beyond the\r\nMississippi and the Missouri, in the earliest days of colonization of\r\nthat vast territory, we can follow the Irish \"trek\" in quest of new\r\nhomes and fortunes. They were part of that irresistible human current\r\nthat swept beyond the ranges of Colorado and Kansas and across the\r\nSierra Nevada until it reached the Pacific, and in the forefront of\r\nthose pathfinders and pioneers we find Martin Murphy, the first to\r\nopen a wagon trail to California from the East. The names of Don\r\nTimoteo Murphy, of Jasper O'Farrell, of Dolans, Burkes, Breens, and\r\nHallorins are linked with the annals of the coast while that\r\nterritory was still under Spanish rule, and when Fremont crossed the\r\nplains and planted the \"Bear flag\" beyond the Sierras, we find\r\nIrishmen among his trusted lieutenants. An Irishman, Captain Patrick\r\nConnor, first penetrated the wilderness of Utah; a descendant of an\r\nIrishman, Hall J. Kelly, was the explorer of Oregon; Philip Nolan and\r\nThomas O'Connor were foremost among those brave spirits \"whose daring\r\nand persistency finally added the Lone Star State to the American\r\nUnion\"; and the famous Arctic explorer, scientist, and scholar, Dr.\r\nElisha Kent Kane, was a descendant of John O'Kane who came from\r\nIreland to the Province of New York in 1752.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo form any reliable estimate of the numerical strength of the Irish\r\nand their descendants in the United States would, I believe, be a\r\nhopeless task, and while several have attempted to do so, I am of the\r\nopinion that all such estimates should be discarded as mere\r\nconjecture. Indeed, there is no standard, or fixed rule or principle,\r\nby which a correct judgment of the racial composition of the early\r\ninhabitants of the United States can now be formed, and the available\r\nstatistics on the subject are incomplete and confusing. The greatest\r\nobstacle in determining this question is found in the names of the\r\nimmigrants themselves. With names such as Smith, Mason, Carpenter,\r\nand Taylor; White, Brown, Black, and Gray; Forrest, Wood, Mountain,\r\nand Vail, and other names that are similarly derived, the first\r\nthought is that they are of English origin. Yet we know that for\r\ncenturies past such names have been numerous in Ireland, and there\r\nare many Irish families so named who are of as pure Celtic blood as\r\nany bearing the old Gaelic patronymics. By a law passed in the second\r\nyear of the reign of Edward IV., natives of Ireland were forced to\r\nadopt English surnames. This Act was, substantially, as follows: \"An\r\nAct that Irishmen dwelling in the Counties of, etc.... shall go\r\nappareled like Englishmen and wear their beards in English manner,\r\nswear allegiance and take English sirnames, which sirnames shall be\r\nof one towne, as Sutton, Chester, Trim, Skryne, Cork, Kinsale; or\r\ncolours, as white, black, brown; or arts, or sciences, as smith or\r\ncarpenter; or office, as cook, butler, etc., and it is enacted that\r\nhe and his issue shall use his name under pain of forfeyting of his\r\ngoods yearly\", etc.\r\n\r\nThis Act could be enforced only upon those Irish families who dwelt\r\nwithin the reach of English law, and as emigrants from those\r\ndistricts, deprived of their pure Celtic names, came to America in an\r\nEnglish guise and in English vessels, they were officially recorded\r\nas \"English.\" Moreover, numbers of Irish frequently crossed the\r\nchannel and began their voyage from English ports, where they had to\r\ntake on new names, sometimes arbitrarily, and sometimes voluntarily\r\nfor purposes of concealment, either by transforming their original\r\nnames into English or adopting names similar to those above referred\r\nto. These names were generally retained on this side of the Atlantic\r\nso as not to arouse the prejudice of their English neighbors. In\r\ncomplying with the statute above quoted, some Irish families accepted\r\nthe rather doubtful privilege of translating their names into their\r\nEnglish equivalents. We have examples of this in such names as\r\nSomers, anglicised from McGauran (presumably derived from the Gaelic\r\nword signifying \"summer\"); Smith from McGowan (meaning \"the son of\r\nthe smith\"); Jackson and Johnson, a literal translation from MacShane\r\n(meaning \"the son of John\"); and Whitcomb from Kiernan (meaning,\r\nliterally, \"a white comb\").\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, in the case of some of those Irish immigrants\r\nwhose family names were not changed in Ireland, their descendants\r\nappear in a much disguised form in the colonial records. Through the\r\nmistakes of clergymen, court clerks, registrars, and others who had\r\ndifficulty in pronouncing Gaelic names, letters became inserted or\r\ndropped and the names were written down phonetically. In the\r\nmutations of time, even these names became still further changed, and\r\nwe find that the descendants of the Irish themselves, after the lapse\r\nof a generation or two, deliberately changed their names, usually by\r\nsuppressing the Milesian prefixes, \"Mac\" and \"O\". Thus we have the\r\nLaflin and Claflin families, who are descended from a McLaughlin, an\r\nIrish settler in Massachusetts in the seventeenth century; the Bryans\r\nfrom William O'Brian, a captain in Sarsfield's army, who, after the\r\nfall of Limerick in 1691, settled in Pasquetank County, N.C., and one\r\nof whose descendants is William Jennings Bryan, now Secretary of\r\nState; the Dunnels of Maine, from an O'Donnell who located in the\r\nSaco Valley; and at the Land Office at Annapolis I have found the\r\ndescendants of Roger O'Dewe, who came to Maryland about 1665,\r\nrecorded under the surnames of \"Roger\", \"Dew\", and \"Dewey\". I find\r\nDennis O'Deeve or O'Deere written down on the Talbot County (Md.)\r\nrecords of the year 1667 with his name reversed, and today his\r\ndescendants are known as \"Dennis\". Many such instances appear in the\r\nearly records, and when we find a New England family rejoicing in the\r\nname of \"Navillus\" we know that the limit has been reached, and while\r\nwe cannot admire the attempt to disguise an ancient and honorable\r\nname, we are amused at the obvious transposition of \"Sullivan\".\r\n\r\nThus we see, that, numerous though the old Irish names are on\r\nAmerican records, they do not by any means indicate the extent of the\r\nCeltic element which established itself in the colonies, so that\r\nthere is really no means of determining exactly what Ireland has\r\ncontributed to the American Commonwealth. We only know that a steady\r\nstream of Irish immigrants has crossed the seas to the American\r\ncontinent, beginning with the middle of the seventeenth century, and\r\nthat many of those \"Exiles from Erin\", or their sons, became\r\nprominent as leaders in every station in life in the new country.\r\n\r\nNor is the \"First Census of the United States\" any criterion in this\r\nregard, for the obvious reason that the enumerators made no returns\r\nof unmarried persons. This fact is important when we consider that\r\nthe Irish exodus of the eighteenth century was largely comprised of\r\nthe youth of the country. Although the First Census was made in 1790,\r\nthe first regular record of immigration was not begun until thirty\r\nyears later, and it is only from the records kept after that time\r\nthat we can depend upon actual official figures. During the decade\r\nfollowing 1820, Ireland contributed more than forty per cent, of the\r\nentire immigration to America from all European countries, and the\r\nIrish Emigration Statistics show that between 1830 and 1907 the\r\nnumber of people who left Ireland was 6,049,432, the majority of whom\r\ncame to America. The _Westminster Review_ (vol. 133, p. 293), in an\r\narticle on \"The Irish-Americans\", puts a series of questions as\r\nfollows: \"Is the American Republic in any way indebted to those Irish\r\ncitizens? Have they with their large numbers, high social standing,\r\ngreat places of trust, contributed aught to her glory or added aught\r\nto her commercial greatness, refined her social taste or assisted in\r\nlaying the foundations of the real happiness of her people, the real\r\nsecurity of her laws, the influence of her civic virtues, which more\r\nthan anything else give power and permanency to a naissant and mighty\r\nnation? The answer is unquestionably affirmative. We have only to\r\nlook back on the past, and to scan the present state of American\r\naffairs, to feel certain of this.\" If it be further asked: \"Does this\r\nstatement stand the test of strict investigation?\" the answer must\r\nalso be in the affirmative, for in almost every line of progress the\r\nIrish in America have contributed their share of leaders and\r\npioneers, thus proving that there are characteristics among even the\r\npoor Irish driven to emigration for an existence that are as capable\r\nof development as those possessed by any other race. When we scan the\r\nintellectual horizon, we see many men of great force of character:\r\npreachers and teachers; statesmen and scholars; philanthropists and\r\nfounders of institutions; scientists and engineers; historians and\r\njournalists; artists and authors; lawyers and doctors, of Celtic race\r\nand blood, while, in the industrial field, as builders of steamships\r\nand railroads and promoters of public works, as merchants,\r\nmanufacturers, and bankers, and in all other fields of endeavor, we\r\nfind the American Irish controlling factors in the upbuilding of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nOf the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Thornton, Taylor,\r\nand Smith were natives of Ireland; McKean, Read, and Rutledge were of\r\nIrish parentage; Lynch and Carroll were grandsons of Irishmen;\r\nWhipple and Hancock were of Irish descent on the maternal side; and\r\nO'Hart (_Irish Pedigrees_) declares that Robert Treat Paine was a\r\ngreat-grandson of Henry O'Neill, hereditary prince of Ulster, who\r\n\"changed his name to that of one of his maternal ancestors so as to\r\nsave his estates\". It was an Irishman who first read the immortal\r\nDocument to the public; an Irishman first printed it; and an Irishman\r\npublished it for the first time with facsimiles of the signatures.\r\n\r\nAt least six American Presidents had more or less of the Celtic\r\nstrain. President Jackson, whose parents came from Co. Down, more\r\nthan once expressed his pride in his Irish ancestry. Arthur's parents\r\nwere from Antrim, Buchanan's from Donegal, and McKinley's\r\ngrandparents came from the same vicinity. Theodore Roosevelt boasts\r\namong his ancestors two direct lines from Ireland, and the first\r\nAmerican ancestor of President Polk was a Pollock from Donegal. The\r\npresent occupant of the White House, Woodrow Wilson, is also of Irish\r\ndescent. Among the distinguished Vice-Presidents of the United States\r\nwere George Clinton and John C. Calhoun, sons of immigrants from\r\nLongford and Donegal respectively, and Calhoun's successor as\r\nchairman of the committee on foreign relations was John Smilie, a\r\nnative of Newtownards, Co. Down.\r\n\r\nAmong American governors since 1800, we find such names as Barry,\r\nBrady, Butler, Carroll, Clinton, Conway, Carney, Connolly, Curtin,\r\nCollins, Donaghey, Downey, Early, Fitzpatrick, Flannegan, Geary,\r\nGorman, Hannegan, Kavanagh, Kearney, Logan, Lynch, Murphy, Moore,\r\nMcKinley, McGill, Meagher, McGrath, Mahone, McCormick, O'Neal,\r\nO'Ferrall, Orr, Roane, Filey, Sullivan, Sharkey, Smith, Talbot, and\r\nWelsh, all of Irish descent. Today we have as governors of States,\r\nGlynn in New York, Dunne in Illinois, Walsh in Massachusetts, O'Neal\r\nin Alabama, Burke in North Carolina, Carey in Wyoming, McGovern in\r\nWisconsin, McCreary in Kentucky, and Tener in Pennsylvania, and not\r\nalone is the governor of the last-mentioned State a native of\r\nIreland, but so also are its junior United States Senator, the\r\nsecretary of the Commonwealth, and its adjutant-general.\r\n\r\nIn the political life of America, many of the sons of Ireland have\r\nrisen to eminence, and in the legislative halls at the National\r\nCapital, the names of Kelly, Fitzpatrick, Broderick, Casserly,\r\nFarley, Logan, Harlan, Hannegan, Adair, Barry, Rowan, Gorman,\r\nKennedy, Lyon, Fitzgerald, Fair, Sewall, Kernan, Butler, Moore,\r\nRegan, Mahone, Walsh, and Flannegan, are still spoken of with respect\r\namong the lawmakers of the nation. William Darrah Kelly served in\r\nCongress for fifty years, and it remained for James Shields to hold\r\nthe unique distinction of representing three different States, at\r\ndifferent times, in the Senate of the United States. Senator Shields\r\nwas a native of Co. Tyrone.\r\n\r\nIn the judiciary have been many shining lights of Irish origin. The\r\nChief Justice of the United States Supreme Court is Edward D. White,\r\ngrandson of a '98 rebel, and one of his ablest associates is Joseph\r\nMcKenna. No more erudite or profound lawyer than Charles O'Conor has\r\nadorned his profession and it can be said with truth that his career\r\nhas remained unrivalled in American history. James T. Brady, Daniel\r\nDougherty, Thomas Addis Emmet, and Charles O'Neill were among the\r\nmost eminent lawyers America has known, while the names of Dennis\r\nO'Brien, Chief Justice of the New York Court of Appeals, John D.\r\nO'Neill, who occupied a like elevated place on the bench of South\r\nCarolina, John D. Phelan of the Alabama Supreme Court, Richard\r\nO'Gorman, Charles P. Daly, Hugh Rutledge, Morgan J. O'Brien, and\r\nothers of like origin, are household words in the legal annals of\r\nAmerica. There is no State in the Union where an Irish-American\r\nlawyer has not distinguished himself.\r\n\r\nThe history of medicine in the United States is adorned with the\r\nnames of many physicians of Irish birth or blood. Several Irish\r\nsurgeons rendered valuable services in the army of the Revolution,\r\namong whom are found Drs. McDonough, McHenry, McCloskey, McCalla,\r\nBurke, Irvine, and Williamson. Dr. John Cochran was appointed by\r\nWashington surgeon-general of the army. Dr. James Lynah of\r\nCharleston, a native of Ireland, became surgeon-general of South\r\nCarolina in recognition of his valuable services to the patriot army.\r\nDr. John McKinley, a native of Ireland, who was a famous physician in\r\nhis day, became the first governor of Delaware. Dr. Ephraim McDowell\r\nis known in the profession as the \"Father of Ovariotomy\", as is Dr.\r\nWilliam J. McNevin the \"Father of American Chemistry\". Dr. John Byrne\r\nof New York had a world-wide fame, and his papers on gynecology have\r\nbeen pronounced by the medical press as \"the best printed in any\r\nlanguage\". One of the most conspicuous figures in medicine in the\r\nUnited States was Dr. Jerome Cochran of Alabama. Drs. Junius F. Lynch\r\nof Florida; Charles McCreery of Kentucky; Hugh McGuire and Hunter\r\nMcGuire of Virginia; Matthew C. McGannon of Tennessee; and James\r\nLynch, Charles J. O'Hagan, and James McBride of South Carolina are\r\nmentioned prominently in the histories of their respective localities\r\nas the foremost medical men of their times, while in Wisconsin the\r\npioneer physician was Dr. William H. Fox, and in Oregon, Dr. John\r\nMcLoughlin. Among New York physicians who achieved high reputations\r\nin their profession were Drs. Thomas Addis Emmet, Frank A. McGuire,\r\nDaniel E. O'Neill, Charles McBurney, Isaac H. Reiley, Alfred L.\r\nCarroll, Howard A. Kelly, Joseph O'Dwyer, and James J. Walsh. These\r\nand many others of Irish descent have been honored by medical\r\nsocieties as leaders and specialists, while it can be said that no\r\nsurgeon of the present day has achieved such a world-wide reputation\r\nas Dr. John B. Murphy of Chicago. Among experts in medico-legal\r\nscience, the names of Drs. Benjamin W. McCreedy and William J.\r\nO'Sullivan of New York stand out prominently, and among the most\r\nnoted contributors to medical journals in the United States, and\r\nrecognized as men of great professional skill and authorities in\r\ntheir respective specialties, have been Drs. F.D. Mooney of St.\r\nLouis; Thomas Fitzgibbon of Milwaukee; John D. Hanrahan of Rutland;\r\nJames McCann and James H. McClelland of Pittsburgh; John A. Murphy\r\nand John McCurdy of Cincinnati; John Keating of Philadelphia; John H.\r\nMurphy of St. Paul; John W.C. O'Neal of Gettysburg; and Arthur\r\nO'Neill of Meadville, Pa. Indeed, it can be said that American\r\nmedical science owes an incalculable debt to Irish genius.\r\n\r\nTheodore Vail, the presiding genius of the greatest telephone system\r\nin the world, is Irish, and so is Carty, its chief engineer. Morse,\r\nthe inventor of the telegraph, was the grandson of an Irishman; Henry\r\nO'Reilly built the first telegraph line in the United States; and\r\nJohn W. Mackey was the president of the Commercial Cable Company.\r\nJohn P. Holland, the inventor of the submarine torpedo boat, was a\r\nnative of Co. Clare; and McCormick, the inventor of the reaping and\r\nmowing machine, was an Irishman's grandson.\r\n\r\nSons of Irishmen have stood in the front rank of American statesmen\r\nand diplomats who represented their country abroad. To mention but a\r\nfew: Richard O'Brien, appointed by Jefferson American representative\r\nat Algiers; James Kavanagh, Minister to Portugal; and Louis McLane,\r\nMinister to England in 1829 and afterwards Secretary of State in\r\n1832. In recent years, an O'Brien has represented American interests\r\nin Italy and Japan; a Kerens in Austria; an Egan in Chili and another\r\nof the same name in Denmark; an O'Shaughnessy in Mexico; a Sullivan\r\nin Santo Domingo; and an O'Rear in Bolivia.\r\n\r\nAmong historians were John Gilmary Shea, author of numerous\r\nhistorical works; Dr. Robert Walsh, a learned historian and\r\njournalist of the last century, whose literary labors were extensive;\r\nMcMahon and McSherry, historians of Maryland; Burk, of Virginia;\r\nO'Callaghan, Hastings, and Murphy of New York; Ramsay of South\r\nCarolina; and Williamson of North Carolina, all native Irishmen or\r\nsons of Irish immigrants.\r\n\r\nIn the field of American journalism have been many able and forcible\r\nwriters of Irish birth or descent. Hugh Gaine, a Belfast man, founded\r\nthe New York _Mercury_ in 1775. John Dunlap founded the first daily\r\npaper in Philadelphia, John Daly Burk published the first daily paper\r\nin Boston, and William Duane edited the _Aurora_ of Philadelphia in\r\n1795. All these were born in Ireland. William Coleman, founder of the\r\nNew York _Evening Post_ in 1801, was the son of an Irish rebel of\r\n1798; Thomas Fitzgerald founded the Philadelphia _Item_; Thomas Gill,\r\nthe New York _Evening Star_; Patrick Walsh, the Augusta _Chronicle_;\r\nJoseph Medill, the Chicago _Tribune_. Henry W. Grady edited the\r\nAtlanta _Constitution_; Michael Dee edited the Detroit _Evening News_\r\nfor nearly fifty years; Richard Smith, the Cincinnati _Gazette_;\r\nEdward L. Godkin, the New York _Evening Post_; William Laffan, the\r\nNew York _Sun_; and Horace Greeley, the New York _Tribune_. All of\r\nthese were either natives of Ireland or sprung from immigrant\r\nIrishmen, as were Oliver of the Pittsburgh _Gazette_, O'Neill of the\r\nPittsburgh _Despatch_, John Keating of Memphis, William D. O'Connor,\r\nand many other shining lights of American journalism during the last\r\ncentury. Fitz James O'Brien was \"a bright, particular star\" in the\r\njournalistic firmament; John MacGahan achieved fame as a war\r\ncorrespondent; Patrick Barry of Rochester, an extensive writer on\r\nhorticultural and kindred subjects, was the recognized leader of his\r\ncraft in the United States; and William Darby, son of Patrick and\r\nMary Darby, and Michael Twomey were the ablest American geographers\r\nand writers on abstruse scientific subjects.\r\n\r\nIn the field of poetry, we have had Theodore O'Hara, the author of\r\nthat immortal poem, \"The Bivouac of the Dead\"; John Boyle O'Reilly;\r\nThomas Dunn English, author of \"Ben Bolt\"; Father Abram Ryan, \"the\r\npoet priest of the South\"; James Whitcomb Riley; Eleanor Donnelly;\r\nM.F. Egan; T.A. Daly; and Joseph I.C. Clarke, president of the\r\nAmerican Irish Historical Society.\r\n\r\nTo recount the successful men of affairs of Irish origin it would be\r\nnecessary to mention every branch of business and every profession.\r\nRecalling but a few, Daniel O'Day, Patrick Farrelly, John and William\r\nO'Brien, Alexander T. Stewart, John Castree, Joseph J. O'Donohue,\r\nWilliam R. Grace, John McConville, Hugh O'Neill, Alexander E. Orr,\r\nWilliam Constable, Daniel McCormick, and Dominick Lynch, all of New\r\nYork, were dominant figures in the world of business. Thomas Mellon\r\nof Pittsburgh; John R. Walsh and the Cudahy brothers of Chicago;\r\nJames Phelan, Peter Donahue, Joseph A. Donohoe, and John Sullivan of\r\nSan Francisco; William A. Clark and Marcus Daly of Montana; George\r\nMeade, the Meases and the Nesbits, Thomas FitzSimmons and Thomas\r\nDolan of Philadelphia; Columbus O'Donnell and Luke Tiernan of\r\nBaltimore, all these have been leading merchants in their day. Few\r\nAmerican financiers occupy a more conspicuous place than Thomas F.\r\nRyan, and no great industrial leader has reached the pinnacle of\r\nsuccess upon which stands the commanding figure of James J. Hill,\r\nboth sons of Irishmen. The names of Anthony N. Brady, Eugene Kelly,\r\nJames S. Stranahan, and James A. Farrell, president of the United\r\nStates Steel Corporation, are household words in business and\r\nfinancial circles.\r\n\r\nJohn Keating, the first paper manufacturer in New York (1775); Thomas\r\nFaye, the first to manufacture wall-paper by machinery, who won for\r\nthis distinction the first gold medal of the American Institute; John\r\nand Edward McLoughlin of New York, for many years the leading\r\npublishers of illustrated books; and John Banigan of Providence, one\r\nof the largest manufacturers of rubber goods in America, were natives\r\nof Ireland. John O'Fallon and Bryan Mullanphy of St. Louis, and John\r\nMcDonough of Baltimore, who amassed great wealth as merchants, were\r\nlarge contributors to charitable and educational institutions;\r\nWilliam W. Corcoran, whose name is enshrined in the famous Art\r\nGallery at Washington, contributed during his lifetime over five\r\nmillion dollars to various philanthropic institutions; and one of the\r\nmost noted philanthropists in American history, and the first woman\r\nin America to whom a public monument was erected, was an Irishwoman,\r\nMargaret Haughery of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nIrishmen have shown a remarkable aptitude for the handling of large\r\ncontracts, and in this field have been prominent John H. O'Rourke,\r\nJames D. Leary, James Coleman, Oliver Byrne, and John D. Crimmins in\r\nNew York; John B. McDonald, the builder of New York's subways; George\r\nLaw, projector and promoter of public works, steamship and railroad\r\nbuilder; and John Roach, the famous ship-builder of Chester, Pa. John\r\nSullivan, a noted American engineer one hundred years ago, completed\r\nthe Middlesex Canal; and John McL. Murphy, whose ability as a\r\nconstructing engineer was universally recognized, rendered valuable\r\nservice to the United States during the Civil War. Among pioneer\r\nship-builders in America are noted Patrick Tracy fron Wexford and\r\nSimon Forrester from Cork, who were both at Salem, Mass., during the\r\nperiod of the Revolution and rendered most valuable service to the\r\npatriot cause; and the O'Briens, Kavanaghs, and Sewalls in Maine.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in the material things of life alone that the Irish\r\nhave been in the van. Thousands of Americans have been charmed by the\r\noperas of Victor Herbert, a grandson of Samuel Lover, and with lovers\r\nof music the strains of Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore's band still linger\r\nas a pleasant memory. Edward A. MacDowell, America's most famous\r\ncomposer, was of Irish descent. The colossal statute of \"America\" on\r\nthe dome of the National Capitol was executed by Thomas Crawford, who\r\nwas born in New York of Irish parents in 1814; Henry Inman, one of\r\nthe very best of portrait painters, was also born in New York of\r\nIrish parents; John Singleton Copley, the distinguished artist, came\r\nto Boston from Co. Clare in 1736; Thompson, the sculptor, was born in\r\nQueen's Co.; another noted sculptor was William D. O'Donovan of\r\nVirginia; and Augustus Saint Gaudens, one of the greatest sculptors\r\nof modern times, was born in Dublin. Other sculptors of Irish race\r\nhave been elsewhere mentioned. Among America's most talented artists\r\nand portrait painters may be mentioned George P. Healy, William J.\r\nHennessy, Thomas Moran, Henry Pelham, Henry Murray, John Neagle, and\r\nWilliam Magrath, all of Irish birth or descent.\r\n\r\nIreland has given many eminent churchmen to the United States. The\r\nthree American Cardinals, Gibbons, Farley, and O'Connell, stand out\r\nprominently, as do Archbishops Carroll, Hughes, McCloskey, Kenrick,\r\nRyan, Ireland, Glennon, Corrigan, and Keane, all of whom have shed\r\nlustre on the Church. History has given to an Irishman, Francis\r\nMakemie of Donegal, the credit of founding Presbyterianism in\r\nAmerica, while among noted Presbyterian divines of Irish birth were\r\nJames Waddell, known as \"the blind preacher of the wilderness,\"\r\nThomas Smyth, John Hall, Francis Allison, William Tennant, and James\r\nMcGrady, all men of great ability and influence in their day. Samuel\r\nFinley, President of Princeton College in 1761, was a native of\r\nArmagh, and John Blair Smith, famous as a preacher throughout the\r\nShenandoah Valley and the first president of Union College (1795),\r\nwas of Irish descent. Among the pioneer preachers of the western\r\nwilderness were McMahon, Dougherty, Quinn, Burke, O'Cool, Delaney,\r\nMcGee, and many others of Irish origin.\r\n\r\nIrishmen and their sons have founded American towns and cities, and\r\nthe capital of the State of Colorado takes its name from General\r\nJames Denver, son of Patrick Denver, an emigrant from county Down in\r\nthe year 1795. Sixty-five places in the United States are named after\r\npeople bearing the Irish prefix \"O\" and upwards of 1000 after the\r\n\"Macs\", and there are 253 counties of the United States and\r\napproximately 7000 places called by Irish family or place names.\r\nThere are 24 Dublins, 21 Waterfords, 18 Belfasts, 16 Tyrones, 10\r\nLimericks, 9 Antrims, 8 Sligos, 7 Derrys, 6 Corks, 5 Kildares, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nImmigrant Irishmen have also been the founders of prominent American\r\nfamilies. One of the most ancient of Irish patronymics, McCarthy, is\r\nfound in the records of Virginia as early as 1635 and in\r\nMassachusetts in 1675, and all down through the successive\r\ngenerations descendants of this sept were among the leading families\r\nof the communities where they located. In Virginia, the McCormick,\r\nMeade, Lewis, Preston, and Lynch families; in the Carolinas, the\r\nCanteys, Nealls, Bryans, and Butlers; and in Maryland, the Carrolls\r\nand Dulanys are all descended from successful Irish colonizers.\r\n\r\nEven from this very incomplete summary, we can see that Irish blood,\r\nbrain, and brawn have been a valuable acquisition to the building of\r\nthe fabric of American institutions, and that the sons of Ireland\r\nmerit more prominent recognition than has been accorded them in the\r\npages of American history. The pharisees of history may have withheld\r\nfrom Ireland the credit that is her due, but, thanks to the\r\nnever-failing guidance of the records, we are able to show that at\r\nall times, whether they came as voluntary exiles or were driven from\r\ntheir homes by the persecutions of government, her sons have had an\r\nhonorable part in every upward movement in American life. Testimony\r\nadduced from the sources from which this imperfect sketch is drawn\r\ncannot be called into question, and its perusal by those who so\r\namusingly glorify the \"Anglo-Saxon\" as the founder of the American\r\nrace and American institutions would have a chastening influence on\r\ntheir ignorance of early American history, and would reopen the long\r\nvista of the years, at the very beginning of which they would see\r\nCelt and Teuton, Saxon and Gaul, working side by side solidifying the\r\nfulcrum of the structure on which this great nation rests.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nThe archives, registers, records, reports, and other official\r\ndocuments mentioned in the text; the various Town, County, and State\r\nHistories; the collections and publications of the following\r\nsocieties: Massachusetts Historical Society, Genealogical Society of\r\nPennsylvania, New York Historical Society (34 vols.), New York\r\nGenealogical and Biographical Society (44 vols.), Maine Historical\r\nSociety, Rhode Island Historical Society, Connecticut Historical\r\nSociety, South Carolina Historical Society, and American Historical\r\nSociety; New England Historical and Genealogical Register (67 vols.,\r\nBoston, 1847-1913); New England Historical and Biographical Record;\r\nHakluyt: Voyages, Navigations, Traffiques, and Discoveries of the\r\nEnglish Nation (London, 1607); Dobbs: The Trade and Improvement of\r\nIreland (Dublin, 1729); Hutchinson: History of Massachusetts from the\r\nFirst Settlement in 1628 until 1750 (Salem, 1795); Proud: History of\r\nPennsylvania, 1681-1770 (Philadelphia, 1797-1798); Savage:\r\nGenealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England (Boston,\r\n1860-1862); Morris (ed.): The Makers of New York (Philadelphia,\r\n1895); Pope: The Pioneers of Massachusetts (Boston, 1900), The\r\nPioneers of Maine and New Hampshire (Boston, 1908); Richardson:\r\nSide-lights on Maryland History (Baltimore, 1913); Spencer: History\r\nof the United States; Ramsay: History of the United States;\r\nPrendergast: Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH IN CANADA\r\n\r\nBy JAMES J. WALSH, M.D., Ph.D., Litt.D., Sc.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Wolfe captured Quebec and Canada came under British rule, some\r\nof the best known of his officers and several of his men were Irish.\r\nAfter the Peace was signed many of them settled in Canada, not a few\r\nof them marrying French wives, and as a consequence there are\r\nnumerous Irish, Scotch, and English names among the French speaking\r\ninhabitants of Lower Canada. Two of Wolfe's officers, Colonel Guy\r\nCarleton, born at Strabane in the county Tyrone, and General Richard\r\nMontgomery, born only seven miles away at Convoy, in the same county,\r\nwere destined to play an important role in the future history of\r\nCanada. Montgomery was in command of the Revolutionary Army from the\r\nColonies, when it attempted to take Quebec, and Carleton, who had\r\nbeen a trusted friend of General Wolfe, was in command of the\r\nCanadian forces. The two men were the lives of their respective\r\ncommands, and with the death of Montgomery Carleton's victory was\r\nassured.  Carleton was made Governor-in-Chief of Canada, and during\r\nthe trying years of the early British rule of New France and the\r\nAmerican Revolution, his tact did more than anything else to save\r\nCanada for the British. Bibaud, the French historian, says, \"the man\r\nto whom the administration of the government was entrusted had known\r\nhow to make the Canadians love him, and this contributed not a little\r\nto retain at least within the bounds of neutrality those among them\r\nwho might have been able, or who believed themselves able, to\r\nameliorate their lot by making common cause with the insurgent\r\ncolonies.\" Shortly after being made governor, Carleton went to\r\nEngland and secured the passage of the Quebec Act through the English\r\nparliament, which gave the Canadian French assurance that they were\r\nto be ruled without oppression by the British Government.\r\nSubsequently, in 1786, Carleton, as Lord Dorchester, became the first\r\ngovernor-general of Canada, being given jurisdiction over Nova Scotia\r\nand New Brunswick as well as Upper and Lower Canada, and to him more\r\nthan to any other is due the early loyalty to the British crown in\r\nthe Dominion.\r\n\r\nAfter the army the next important source of Irish population in\r\nCanada were the loyalists who after the Revolution removed from the\r\nUnited States to the British Dominions in America. There were\r\nprobably many thousands of them, more than enough to make up for the\r\nFrench who left Canada for France when the territory passed over to\r\nEngland. Among the Irish loyalists who went to Canada was the Rev.\r\nJohn Stuart, who had become very well known as a missionary in the\r\nMohawk Valley before the Revolution, and who, though born a\r\nPresbyterian, was destined to win the title of the \"Father of the\r\nChurch of England in Upper Canada.\" When the first Canadian\r\nparliament met in December 1792, Edward O'Hara was returned for\r\nGaspé, in Lower Canada, and D'Arcy McGee could boast that\r\nhenceforward Lower Canada was never without an Irish representative\r\nin its legislative councils.\r\n\r\nWhen the question of settling Upper Canada with British colonists\r\ncame up, Colonel Talbot, a county Dublin man, was the most important\r\nfactor. He obtained a large grant of land near what is now London and\r\nattracted settlers into what was at that time a wilderness. The tract\r\nsettled under his superintendence now comprises twenty-nine townships\r\nin the most prosperous part of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe maritime Provinces had been under British rule before the fall of\r\nQuebec and contained a large element of Irish population. In\r\nNewfoundland in 1753 out of a total population of some thirteen\r\nthousand, Davin says that there were nearly five thousand Catholics,\r\nchiefly Irish. In 1784 a great new stimulus to Irish immigration to\r\nNewfoundland was given by Father O'Connell, who in 1796 was made\r\nCatholic bishop of the island. Newfoundland, for its verdure, the\r\nabsence of reptiles, and its Irish inhabitants, was called at this\r\ntime \"Transatlantic Ireland\", and Bonnycastle says that more than one\r\nhalf of the population was Irish.\r\n\r\nIn 1749 Governor Cornwallis brought some 4,000 disbanded soldiers to\r\nNova Scotia and founded Halifax. Ten years later it was described as\r\ndivided into Halifax proper, Irishtown or the southern, and Dutchtown\r\nor the northern, suburbs. The inhabitants numbered 3,000, one-third\r\nof whom were Irish. They were among the most prominent men of the\r\ncity and province. In the Privy Council for 1789 were Thomas Corcoran\r\nand Charles Morris. Morris was president of the Irish Society and\r\nMatthew Cahill the sheriff of Halifax in that year. A large number of\r\nIrish from the north of Ireland settled in Nova Scotia in 1763,\r\ncalling their settlement Londonderry. They provided a fortunate\r\nrefuge for the large numbers of Irish Presbyterians who were expelled\r\nfrom New England by the intolerant Puritans the following year. They\r\nalso welcomed many loyalists who came from New York and the New\r\nEngland States after the acknowledgment of the independence of the\r\nAmerican Colonies by Great Britain. Between the more eastern settlers\r\naround Halifax and those in the interior, the greater part of the\r\npopulation of Nova Scotia was probably Irish in origin.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Maritime Provinces that the first step in political\r\nemancipation for Catholics under British rule was made. In 1821\r\nLawrence Cavanaugh, a Roman Catholic, was returned to the Assembly of\r\nthe Province for Cape Breton. He would not subscribe to the\r\ndeclaration on Transubstantiation in the oath of office tendered him,\r\nand as a consequence was refused admittance to the Assembly. But he\r\nwas elected again and again, and six years afterwards Judge\r\nHaliburton, better known by his _nom de plume_ of \"Sam Slick\", in an\r\nable speech, seconded the motion to dispense with the declaration,\r\nand Cavanaugh was permitted to take the oath without the declaration.\r\n\r\nThe War of 1812 brought over from Ireland a number of Irish soldiers\r\nserving in the British army, many of whom after the war settled down\r\nand became inhabitants of the country. They were allotted farm lands\r\nand added much to Canada's prosperity. A type of their descendants\r\nwas Sir William Hingston, whose father was at this time a lieutenant\r\nadjutant in the Royal 100th Regiment, \"the Dublins.\" Sir William's\r\nfather died when his son was a mere boy, but the lad supported his\r\nmother, worked his way through the medical school, saved enough money\r\nto give himself two years in Europe, and became a great surgeon. He\r\nwas elected three times mayor of Montreal, serving one term with\r\ngreat prestige under the most trying circumstances. He afterwards\r\nbecame a senator of the Dominion and was knighted by Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nPrince Edward Island was settled mainly by the Scotch and French, and\r\nyet many Irish names are to be found among its old families. It was\r\nceded to Great Britain in 1763, and the first Governor appointed was\r\nCaptain Walter Patterson, whose niece, Elizabeth Patterson, was\r\nmarried to Jerome Bonaparte in Baltimore in 1803. Captain Patterson\r\nwas so ardent an Irishman that through his influence he had an act\r\npassed by the Assembly changing the name of the island to New\r\nIreland, but the home Government refused to countenance the change.\r\nAt this time the island was known as St. John's, and the name Prince\r\nEdward was given to it in honor of the Duke of Kent in 1789. One of\r\nthe most popular governors of the island was Sir Dominick Daly,\r\nknighted while in office. He was a member of a well known Galway\r\nfamily, and first came to America as secretary to one of the\r\ngovernors. He afterwards became provincial secretary for Lower\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nCanada suffered from the aftermath of the revolutions which took\r\nplace in Europe during the early part of the nineteenth century. The\r\nyear 1837 saw two revolutions, one in Upper, the other in Lower,\r\nCanada, though neither of them amounted to more than a flash in the\r\npan. As might be expected, there were not a few Irish among the\r\ndisaffected spirits who fostered these revolutions. Their experience\r\nat home led them to know how little oppressed people were likely to\r\nobtain from the British Government except by a demonstration of\r\nforce. There were serious abuses, especially \"the Family Compact\",\r\nthe lack of anything approaching constitutional guarantees in\r\ngovernment, and political disabilities on the score of religion.\r\nHowever, most of the Irish in Canada were ranged on the side of the\r\ngovernment. Sir Richard Bonnycastle, writing in 1846, said \"The\r\nCatholic Irish who have been long settled in the country are by no\r\nmeans the worst subjects in this transatlantic realm, as I can\r\npersonally testify, having had the command of large bodies of them\r\nduring the border troubles of 1837-8. They are all loyal and true.\"\r\nAbove all Bonnycastle pledged himself for the loyalty of the Irish\r\nCatholic priesthood.\r\n\r\nOne of the Irishmen who came into prominence in the rebellions of\r\n1837 was Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan, the editor of the _Vindicator_,\r\nthe newspaper by means of which Papineau succeeded in arousing much\r\nfeeling among the people of Lower Canada and fomented the Revdlution.\r\nO'Callaghan escaped to the United States and settled at Albany, where\r\nhe became the historian of New York State. To him, more than to any\r\nother, we owe the preservation of the historical materials out of\r\nwhich the early history of the State can be constructed. Rare volumes\r\nof the Jesuit Relations, to the value of which for historical\r\npurposes he had called special attention, were secured from his\r\nlibrary for the Canadian library at Ottawa.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the nineteenth century, when the population of\r\nIreland reached its highest point of over 8,000,000, the pressure on\r\nthe people caused them to emigrate in large numbers, and then the\r\nfamine came to drive out great crowds of those who survived. In\r\nproportion to its population Canada received a great many more of\r\nthese Irish emigrants than did the United States. Unfortunately the\r\nconditions on board the emigrant sailing vessels in those days cost\r\nmany lives. They were often becalmed and took months to cross the\r\nocean. My grandmother coming in the thirties was ninety-three days in\r\ncrossing, landing at Quebec after seven weeks on half rations, part\r\nof the time living on nothing but oatmeal and water. Ship fever, the\r\ndreaded typhus, broke out on her vessel as on so many others, and\r\nmore than half the passengers perished. Many, many thousands of the\r\nIrish emigrants thus died on ship-board or shortly after landing. In\r\n1912, the Ancient Order of Hibernians erected near Quebec a monument\r\nto the victims. In spite of the untoward conditions, emigration\r\ncontinued unabated, and in 1875, in the population of Ontario,\r\nQuebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, it was calculated that the\r\nIrish numbered 846,414 as compared with 706,369 English and 549,946\r\nScotch (Hatton, quoted by Davin in _The Irishman In Canada_).\r\n\r\nIt had become clear that Canada would prosper more if united than in\r\nseparate provinces jealous of each other. The first move in this\r\ndirection came from the Maritime Provinces, where the Irish element\r\nwas so much stronger than elsewhere, and when a conference of the\r\nleading statesmen of these Provinces was appointed to be held at\r\nCharlottetown, P.E.I., September 1864, representatives of Upper and\r\nLower Canada asked to be allowed to be present to bring forward a\r\nplan for a Federation of all the British Provinces in North America.\r\nThe British North America Act was passed, and received the royal\r\nassent, the queen appointing July 1, 1867 as the formal beginning of\r\nthe Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\nAmong the men who were most prominent in bringing about federation\r\nand who came to be known as the Fathers of Confederation were several\r\ndistinguished Irishmen. Thomas D'Arcy McGee was the best known and\r\nprobably did more than any other Canadian to make the idea of\r\nconfederation popular by his writings and speeches. He had come to\r\nCanada as a stranger, edited a newspaper in Montreal, and was elected\r\nto the Assembly after a brief residence, in spite of the opposition\r\ncries of \"Irish adventurer\" and \"stranger from abroad,\" was\r\nsubsequently elected four times by acclamation, and was Minister of\r\nAgriculture and Education and Canadian Commissioner to the Paris\r\nExposition of 1867. His letters to the Earl of Mayo, pleading for the\r\nbetterment of conditions in Ireland, were quoted by Gladstone during\r\nthe Home Rule movement as \"a prophetic voice from the dead coming\r\nfrom beyond the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of the Fathers of Confederation was the Honorable Edward\r\nWhalen, born in the county Mayo, who as a young man went to Prince\r\nEdward Island, where he gained great influence as a popular\r\njournalist. He was an orator as well as an editor, and came to have\r\nthe confidence of the people of the island, and hence was able to do\r\nvery much for federation. A third of the Fathers of Confederation\r\nfrom the Maritime Provinces was the Honorable, afterwards Sir, Edward\r\nKenny, who, when the first Cabinet of the New Dominion was formed,\r\nwas offered and accepted one of the portfolios in recognition of the\r\ninfluence which he had wielded for Canadian union.\r\n\r\nAt all times in the history of Canada the Catholic hierarchy has been\r\nlooked up to as thoroughly conservative factors for the progress and\r\ndevelopment of the country. After the Irish immigration most of the\r\nhigher ecclesiastics were Irish by birth or descent, and they all\r\nexerted a deep influence not only on their own people but on their\r\ncity and province. One of the Fathers of Confederation was Archbishop\r\nConnolly, of Halifax, of whom the most distinguished Presbyterian\r\nclergyman of the Lower Provinces said the day after his death: \"I\r\nfeel that I have not only lost a friend, but as if Canada had lost a\r\npatriot; in all his big-hearted Irish fashion he was ever at heart,\r\nin mind, and deed, a true Canadian.\" Among his colleagues of the\r\nhierarchy were such men as his predecessor Archbishop Walsh,\r\nArchbishop Lynch, the first Metropolitan of Upper Canada when Toronto\r\nwas erected into an archbishopric, Bishop Hogan of Kingston,\r\nArchbishop Hannan of Halifax, Archbishop Walsh of Toronto, and\r\nArchbishop O'Brien of Halifax, all of whom were esteemed as faithful\r\nCanadians working for the benefit of their own people more\r\nespecially, but always with the larger view of good for the whole\r\ncommonwealth of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Irish continued to furnish great representative men to Canada.\r\nThe first governor, Guy Carleton, was Irish, and his subsequent\r\ngovernor-generalship as Lord Dorchester did much to make Canada loyal\r\nto Great Britain. During the difficult times of the Civil War in the\r\nUnited States, Lord Monck, a Tipperary man, was the tactful\r\ngovernor-general, \"like other Irish Governors singularly successful\r\nin winning golden opinions\" (Davin). Probably the most popular and\r\ninfluential of Canada's governors-general was Lord Dufferin, another\r\nIrishman. Some of the most distinguished of Canadian jurists,\r\neditors, and politicians have been Irishmen, and Irishmen have been\r\namong her great merchants, contractors, and professional men. In our\r\nown time Sir William Hingston among the physicians, Sir Charles\r\nFitzpatrick among the jurists, and Sir Thomas George Shaughnessy\r\namong the administrative financiers are fine types of Irish\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nDavin: The Irishman in Canada (Toronto, 1877); McGee: Works; Tracy:\r\nThe Tercentenary History of Canada (New York, 1908); Walsh: Sir\r\nWilliam Hingston, in the Amer.

The\r\ntwentieth century will probably see hundreds following in the\r\nfootsteps of their predecessors. In the meantime, the brilliant\r\nachievements of numerous Irish men and women in that part of the\r\nworld are falling into oblivion, and call for a friendly hand to\r\ncollect the fragments of historical lore connected with their\r\nexploits.\r\n\r\nThis paper will cover three periods:--\r\n\r\n(1). From the Spanish Conquest to the War of Independence: here the\r\nprincipal actors were maritime explorers, buccaneers, and mercantile\r\nadventurers;\r\n\r\n(2). The War of Independence from 1810 to 1826: in this period\r\nIrishmen performed feats of valor worthy to rank with those in Greek\r\nor Roman history.\r\n\r\n(3). Since the Independence; a period of commercial and industrial\r\ndevelopment, in which Irishmen have played a foremost part.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been said that George Barlow, the companion of Sebastian\r\nCabot, was an Irishman. Cabot was the first Britisher to sail up the\r\nRio de la Plata, and gave it its name just thirty-five years after\r\nthe discovery of America. Barlow was in the service of the king of\r\nSpain, and in that country met Cabot, who had been appointed Pilot\r\nMajor to his Majesty in the year 1518. In 1577 we read of the famous\r\nAdmiral Drake's expedition to the River Plate, which he reached on\r\nApril 14, 1578. Evidently it was a successful one in the opinion of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, for on Drake's return to Plymouth, September 26,\r\n1580, she came aboard his ship and knighted him. There seem to have\r\nbeen three Irishmen on this expedition, Fenton, Merrick, and Ward.\r\nFenton, who was in command of two vessels, was attacked by a Spanish\r\nsquadron between Brazil and the River Plate, and the battle continued\r\nby moonlight until one of the Spaniards was sunk. The Spanish\r\nhistorian adds that Fenton might have sunk another of the enemy's\r\nships, but refrained because there were several women on board.\r\n\r\nLozana in his _History_ mentions a revolution in Paraguay in 1555,\r\nwhich was headed by an Irishman named Nicholas Colman. This\r\nrevolution was quickly suppressed by the Spanish viceroy, Yrala, but\r\nColman led a second revolution in 1570, when Captain Rigueline was\r\ngovernor of Guayra. The mutineers named Colman for their chief, put\r\ntheir treasures into canoes, and floated down the Parana until their\r\nboats were capsized by some rapids, probably the falls of Apipe in\r\nMisiones. The viceroy, on hearing of the revolt, sent troops to bring\r\nback the fugitives, and the latter were treated with unusual\r\nclemency. Lozana describes Colman as a daring, turbulent buccaneer.\r\nFor fifteen years he seems to have played an important part in\r\nGuayra; his subsequent fate is unknown.\r\n\r\nIn 1626 an expedition commanded by James Purcell, an Irishman,\r\nestablished itself on the island of Tocujos, in the mouth of the\r\nAmazon.\r\n\r\nCaptain Charles O'Hara was sent by Governor Arana from Montevideo in\r\nMarch, 1761, to destroy the old landmarks of Rio Negro and Ching\r\nbetween the dominions of Portugal and Spain. The officer next under\r\nhim was Lieutenant Charles Murphy, afterwards governor of Paraguay.\r\nThis expedition suffered great hardships.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the expeditions of the privateers of the eighteenth\r\ncentury sailed from Ireland. Dampier, a skilful navigator, went on a\r\ncruise to intercept the Spanish galleons returning from the River\r\nPlate with booty supposed to be worth £600,000 sterling. He sailed\r\nfrom Kinsale in September, 1703, with two vessels, and no doubt\r\namongst the crews were many Irishmen. It was on this expedition that\r\nAlexander Selkirk, a Scotch sailor, was put on shore at Juan\r\nFernandez in 1704, where he remained until rescued by Captain Rogers,\r\nwho commanded the _Duke_, a vessel of 320 tons, which sailed from\r\nCork on September 1, 1708, touched by chance at Juan Fernandez, and\r\nfound the original of Defoe's remarkable story, _Robinson Crusoe_,\r\nwho presented a wild appearance dressed in his goatskins.\r\n\r\nIn 1765 Captain Macnamara, with two vessels called the _Lord Clive_\r\nand the _Ambuscade_, mounting between them 104 guns, attempted to\r\ntake Colonia, in front of Buenos Ayres, from the Spaniards. Having\r\nshelled the place for four hours, Macnamara expected every moment to\r\nsee a white flag hoisted, when, by some mishap, the _Lord Clive_ took\r\nfire, and 262 persons perished. The Spaniards fired upon the poor\r\nfellows in the water, only 78 escaping to land. Macnamara was seen to\r\nsink. His sword was found a few years ago by a Colonia fisherman, who\r\npresented it to the British consul at Montevideo. Most of the Irish\r\nnames still extant in the Argentine provinces, such as Sarsfield,\r\nCarrol, and Butler, are probably derived from these captives. Among\r\nthe descendants of the survivors of Macnamara's expedition may be\r\nmentioned the ablest lawyer ever known in Buenos Ayres and for many\r\nyears Prime Minister, the late Dr. Velez Sarsfield, and also Governor\r\nO'Neill.\r\n\r\nThe year 1586 saw an expedition of a very different character,\r\nconsisting of the first Jesuits sent to convert Paraguay, under the\r\ndirection of Father Thomas Field, an Irishman, and son of a Limerick\r\ndoctor. Their vessel fell into the hands of English privateers off\r\nthe Brazilian coast, but the sea rovers respected their captives, and\r\nafter sundry adventures the latter landed at Buenos Ayres, whence\r\nthey proceeded over land to Cordoba. The year following they set out\r\nfor Paraguay, where Father Field and his companions laid the\r\nfoundation of the Jesuit commonwealth of Misiones, which had such\r\nwonderful development in the following two centuries as to cause\r\nVoltaire to admit that \"the Jesuit establishment in Paraguay seems to\r\nbe the triumph of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Irish Jesuit, Father Thaddeus Ennis, appears in authority in\r\nMisiones shortly before the downfall. In 1756, when Spain ceded San\r\nMiguel and other missions to Portugal, Father Ennis was entrusted\r\nwith the removal lower down to Parana of such tribes as refused to\r\nbecome Portuguese subjects.\r\n\r\nYet another Jesuit, Father Falkiner, son of an Irish Protestant\r\ndoctor in Manchester, who had himself studied medicine, was one of\r\nthe most successful travellers and missionaries of the 18th century.\r\nAmong his friends in London was a ship-captain who traded from the\r\ncoast of Guinea to Brazil, carrying slaves for the company recently\r\nestablished by Queen Anne's patent, and he it doubtless was who\r\nprevailed on the young physician to try a seafaring life. In one of\r\nhis voyages as ship surgeon, from Guinea to Buenos Ayres, he fell ill\r\nat the latter port, and, there being no hotels, he had the good\r\nfortune to enjoy the hospitality of the Jesuit superior, Father\r\nMahony, whose name proclaims his Irish nationality. Such was the\r\nimpression made on Falkiner by the kindness of the Jesuits that he\r\nshortly afterwards was received into the Church and entered as a\r\nnovice in the College of St. Ignatius at Buenos Ayres. He spent the\r\nfirst years of his missionary career in Misiones and Tucuman. Later\r\non he was despatched by his superior to Patagonia, and his success\r\nthere during 27 years was almost equal to what has already been\r\nmentioned of Father Field in Paraguay. He converted many tribes, and\r\ntraversed nearly every part of Patagonia from Rio Negro to Magellan's\r\nStraits, and as far inland as the Andes. He knew most of the Indian\r\ntongues, and by his winning manners and knowledge of medicine gained\r\na great influence over the savages. When he published his life and\r\ntravels, such was the effect of his book upon the king of Spain that\r\nhe at once ordered surveys and settlements to be made along the\r\nPatagonian coast, which Father Falkiner represented as exposed to\r\nseizure by the first adventurer who should land there. Father\r\nFalkiner's book has been translated into French, German, and Spanish.\r\nHe returned to England and died at Spetchly, Worcestershire, near the\r\nend of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 the bishop of Ayachucho was Dr. James O'Phelan, who rebuilt\r\nthe old Cathedral of Pasco. His father was an Irish officer in the\r\nSpanish army.\r\n\r\nII.--THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the 18th century the Pitt administration lent a\r\nwilling ear to a Venezuelan patriot, General Miranda, who proposed\r\nthat Great Britain should aid South America to expel the Spanish\r\nrulers and set up a number of independent states. Spain being the\r\nally of France and paying an annual subsidy to Napoleon, it became\r\nmoreover the object of England to seize the treasure-ships\r\nperiodically arriving from the River Plate.\r\n\r\nHostilities having broken out in Europe in 1803, an English squadron\r\nunder an Irish commander, Captain Moore, captured in the following\r\nyear some Spanish galleons laden with treasure at the mouth of the\r\nRiver Plate. In June, 1806, Major General William Carr Beresford with\r\na British squadron cast anchor about twelve miles from Buenos Ayres,\r\nand with a force of only 1635 men took possession of that city of\r\n60,000 inhabitants. The indignation which such a humiliation at first\r\ncaused among the people was in large measure calmed by the manifesto\r\nwhich the conquering commander issued on the occasion. In the\r\n_Memoirs_ of General Belgrano we read: \"It grieved me to see my\r\ncountry subjugated in this manner, but I shall always admire the\r\ngallantry of the brave and honorable Beresford in so daring an\r\nenterprise.\" Beresford was, however, unable to hold his ground, for\r\nthe Spaniards got together an army of 10,000 men, and re-took the\r\ncity. Beresford was made prisoner, but after five months' detention\r\nhe and his brother-officers, among whom was another Irishman, Major\r\nFahy, managed to escape. Thus ended the expedition of this brave\r\ngeneral, who nevertheless had covered himself and his little army\r\nwith glory, for he held Buenos Ayres as a British colony for 45 days,\r\nand had he been properly supported from home the result would in all\r\nprobability have been vastly different.\r\n\r\nGeneral Beresford was one of the most distinguished men of his time.\r\nHe was the illegitimate son of the Marquis of Waterford, entered the\r\narmy at 16, and served in every quarter of the globe. After his\r\ndefeat at Buenos Ayres he captured Madeira, and was made governor of\r\nthat island. In 1808 he successfully covered the retreat of Sir John\r\nMoore to Corunna, a difficult feat, for which he received a marshal's\r\nbaton, and was made commander-in-chief in Portugal. In 1811 he\r\ndefeated Marshal Soult at Albuera, and subsequently took part in the\r\nvictories of Salamanca and Vittoria. For these services he was made\r\nDuke of Elvas, and the British government conferred on him in 1814\r\nthe title of Baron Beresford of Albuera and Dungannon. The same year\r\nhe was sent as minister to Brazil, and on his return was created\r\nviscount. He married the widow of Thomas Hope the banker, and settled\r\ndown on his estates in Kent, where he died in 1854.\r\n\r\nThe brilliancy of Beresford's achievement in capturing Buenos Ayres\r\nwith a handful of men had dazzled the minds of English statesmen, who\r\nfelt that 10,000 British troops were enough to subdue the whole of\r\nthe vast continent of South America. In May, 1807, an expedition\r\ncomprising several frigates and transports with 5,000 troops appeared\r\noff Montevideo from England. A month later Lieutenant-General\r\nWhitelock arrived with orders to assume the chief command, and among\r\nhis officers were the gallant Irishmen, Major Vandeleur, who\r\ncommanded a wing of the 88th Regiment, and Lieutenant-Colonel Nugent,\r\nof the 38th. Whitelock endeavored, but failed, to retake Buenos\r\nAyres. During the siege a small detachment of Spanish troops under\r\nColonel James Butler, after a terrific conflict, in which they sold\r\ntheir lives dearly, were all killed. Agreeably to Colonel Butler's\r\nrequest his remains were buried on the spot he had so valiantly\r\ndefended, and his tombstone was visible there until 1818.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that several of the South American countries,\r\nMexico, Peru, and Chile, were governed by viceroys of Irish birth in\r\nthe critical period preceding the Independence, although Spanish law\r\nforbade such office to any but Spaniards born. It was in recognition\r\nof gallant services in Spain, in combination with the Duke of\r\nWellington, that General O'Donoghue was made viceroy of Mexico in\r\n1821, but the elevation of the great viceroy of Peru, Ambrose\r\nO'Higgins, was due to the splendid talents of administration already\r\ndisplayed by him during twenty years of service in Chile. He was born\r\nat Summerhill, Co. Meath, about 1730. An uncle of his was one of the\r\nchaplains at the court of Madrid, and at his expense O'Higgins was\r\neducated at a college in Cadiz. He then entered the Spanish engineer\r\ncorps, and in 1769 was given the command of the commission sent to\r\nChile to strengthen the fortifications of Valdivia. He was made\r\ncaptain-general of Chile in 1788, was subsequently created marquis of\r\nOsorno, and in 1796 was nominated viceroy of Peru, a position which\r\nhe held until his death in 1801.\r\n\r\nThe great viceroy left only one son, Bernard O'Higgins, who succeeded\r\nGeneral Carreras in the supreme command of the patriot army against\r\nthe Spaniards in 1813. In 1817 O'Higgins took a principal part in the\r\nvictory of Chacabuco, and was almost immediately appointed supreme\r\ndirector of Chile, with dictatorial powers. During his\r\nadministration, which lasted six years, he gave every proof of his\r\nfitness for the position. But, alas! it was the misfortune of South\r\nAmerica to surpass the republics of antiquity in the ingratitude\r\nshown towards its greatest benefactors. It is then not surprising to\r\nfind that the Father of his Country, as O'Higgins is affectionately\r\nstyled, was deposed by a military revolution, and obliged to take\r\nrefuge in Peru, from which country he never returned. General Miller\r\nand Lord Cochrane, in their _Memoirs_, give frequent testimony to the\r\nhonesty and zeal of Bernard O'Higgins. He was always treated as an\r\nhonored guest in Lima, in which city he died on October 24, 1842. He\r\nleft a son, Demetrio O'Higgins, a wealthy land-owner, who contributed\r\nlarge sums for the patriot army against Spain.\r\n\r\nAmong other Irish commanders in Chile and Peru, who, during the War\r\nof Independence, fought their way to dignity and rank, was General\r\nMacKenna, the hero of Membrillar. He was born in 1771, at Clogher,\r\nCo. Tyrone; his mother belonged to the ancient Irish sept of\r\nO'Reilly, whose estates were confiscated after the fall of Limerick\r\nin 1691.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomond O'Brien, who won his spurs at the battle of\r\nChacabuco, seems to have been born in the south of Ireland about\r\n1790. He joined the army of San Martin, and accompanied that general\r\nthrough the campaigns of Chile and Peru until the overthrow of the\r\nSpanish régime and the proclamation of San Martin as protector of\r\nPeru. On the day (July 28, 1821) when independence was declared at\r\nLima, the protector took in his hand the standard of Pizarro and\r\nsaid, \"This is my portion of the trophies.\" Then, taking the state\r\ncanopy of Pizarro, a kind of umbrella always borne over the viceroys\r\nin processions, he presented it to General O'Brien, saying, \"This is\r\nfor the gallant comrade who fought so many years by my side in the\r\ncause of South America.\" The inscription on the canopy, in O'Brien's\r\nhand, says that it was brought to Peru on Pizarro's second journey\r\nfrom Spain. Little did the viceroys think that its last owner would\r\nbe an Irishman.\r\n\r\nGeneral O'Connor, one of the most distinguished soldiers of the War\r\nof Independence, played an important part in the final victory of\r\nAyachucho. For his gallantry on that day he was promoted to the rank\r\nof general by the commander-in-chief, General Bolivar. After the War\r\nof Independence he became Minister of War in Bolivia. General\r\nO'Connor went to South America as an ensign in the Irish Legion under\r\nGeneral Devereux. He claimed direct descent from Roderic O'Conor,\r\nlast king of Ireland, 1186.\r\n\r\nCaptain Esmonde also fought in the War of Independence. He was\r\nbrother to the then baronet, Sir Thomas Esmonde, of Co. Wexford. In\r\nlater years Captain Esmonde was employed by the Peruvian government\r\nto report on some proposed canals at Tarapaca. The vessel in which he\r\nembarked was never more heard of.\r\n\r\nColonel Charles Carroll had served in Spain, but joined the Chilian\r\narmy after independence was gained. He was one of the most popular\r\nofficers in the army, and met with a sad fate. Being sent with too\r\nsmall a detachment against the savage Indians, their commander,\r\nBenavides, cut his forces in pieces and murdered all the officers in\r\na most cruel manner. O'Carroll had his tongue cut out and was then\r\nbutchered.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Colonel Moran, who commanded the Colombian legion at the\r\nbattle of Ayachucho, probably came out in the legion of General\r\nDevereux.\r\n\r\nColonel (afterwards General) O'Leary was first aide-decamp to General\r\nBolivar, the Liberator, and received his last breath. He was nephew\r\nto the famous Father Arthur O'Leary. Bolivar employed him on various\r\nmissions of great trust and says \"he acquitted himself with great\r\nability.\" After the war, General O'Leary was appointed British chargé\r\nd'affaires at Bogota, and died in Rome in 1868. General Arthur\r\nSandes, a native of Dublin, was entrusted with an important garrison\r\nin Peru on the close of the War of Independence.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Brown, the distinguished commander and hero of the War of\r\nIndependence, whose exploits may be ranked, like those of Nelson,\r\n\"above all Greek, above all Roman fame,\" was born at Foxford, Co.\r\nMayo, Ireland, on the 22nd of June, 1777. His father emigrated with\r\nhis family to Pennsylvania. A ship captain who was about to sail from\r\nPhiladelphia offered to take the intelligent Irish boy with him, and\r\nthe offer was promptly accepted. During twenty years he seems to have\r\nvoyaged to many countries; at one time we find him at Archangel.\r\nBrown had been in Buenos Ayres just two years when the patriot\r\ngovernment offered him command of a squadron to commence hostilities\r\nagainst the Spanish navy, then mistress of all the coasts and waters\r\nof South America. On the memorable 8th of March, 1814, Brown sailed\r\nout of the port of Buenos Ayres with three ships to commence a\r\ncampaign, which was destined to destroy the Spanish navy in this part\r\nof the waters of the New World. With him went his fellow-countrymen,\r\nCaptains Seaver and Kearney. Brown's next exploits were against\r\nSpanish shipping in the Pacific, and his entirely successful campaign\r\nat sea against Brazil, in which he gained the mastery by his\r\nwonderful skill, courage, and perseverance, keeping at bay the great\r\nnaval power of that country (which consisted at one time of fifty war\r\nvessels) with his few, small, ill-supplied, and ill-armed craft.\r\nAfter these great exploits Brown spent some months among the wild\r\nscenery of Mayo, so dear to him in boyhood, and, returning to Buenos\r\nAyres, devoted himself to the quiet life of a country gentleman. He\r\ndied surrounded by his family and friends on May 3, 1857, and the day\r\nof his funeral was one of national mourning. His widow erected a\r\nmonument to his memory in the Recoleta cemetery, and in 1872 the\r\nmunicipality of Buenos Ayres granted a site for a public statue on\r\nthe Pasco Julio, which so often rang with the plaudits of the people\r\nas they welcomed this great Irishman returning from victory.\r\n\r\nNo brighter pages occur in the history of the New World than those\r\nwhich commemorate the gallantry and self-devotion of the Irish\r\nsoldiers who aided South Americans to throw off the yoke of Spain. In\r\n1819 an Irish Legion of 1729 men arrived under the command of General\r\nDevereux, a Wexford landowner, called the Lafayette of South America,\r\nto fight in the campaign of General Bolivar. Devereux was\r\ndistinguished for his great bravery. After the War of Independence he\r\nreturned to Europe, being commissioned to form a company for mining\r\noperations in Colombia, which country had appointed him envoy\r\nextraordinary to various European courts.\r\n\r\nColonel Ferguson and Captain Talbot were both Irishmen and among the\r\nlast survivors of Devereux's Legion. It is computed that one-third of\r\nthe Irish who came out under General Devereux died in hospital. It\r\nwas this legion which won the decisive battle of Carabobo, June 26,\r\n1821, going into action 1100 strong and leaving 600 on that\r\nhard-fought field.\r\n\r\nAmong the officers who composed Bolivar's Albion Rifles we find the\r\nIrish names of Pigott, Tallon, Peacock, Phelan, O'Connell, McNamara,\r\nFetherstonhaugh, French, Reynolds, Byrne, and Haig, and the medical\r\nofficer was Dr. O'Reilly. We find mention in General Millar's\r\n_Memoirs_ of Dr. Moore, an Irishman, who attended Bolivar in most of\r\nhis campaigns and was devotedly attached to the person of the\r\nLiberator. Lieutenant-Colonel Hughes, Major Maurice Hogan, Lieutenant\r\nWilliam Keogh, Captain Laurence McGuire, Lieutenant-Colonel S.\r\nCollins also served in the struggle for independence.\r\n\r\nThe period of independence found a small number of Irish residents in\r\nBuenos Ayres, mostly patrician families, such as Dillon, MacMurrough,\r\nMurphy, French, O'Gorman, Orr, Butler, O'Shee, who had been exiled or\r\nhad fled from Ireland and obtained the king of Spain's permission to\r\nsettle in Spanish America. The descendants of these families are now\r\nso intermarried in the country that they have mostly forgotten the\r\nlanguage and traditions of their ancestors; but they occupy high\r\npositions in political, legal, and commercial circles.\r\n\r\nIII.--THE PERIOD AFTER THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\nA remarkable influx of settlers from Ireland occurred between 1825\r\nand 1830, to work in the _saladeros_, or salt mines, of the Irish\r\nmerchants, Brown, Dowdall, and Armstrong. Previous to this a few\r\nIrish mechanics and others had come from the United States. In 1813\r\nBernard Kiernan came from New Brunswick. He seems to have devoted\r\nhimself to science, as the papers mention his discovery of a comet in\r\nthe Magellan clouds on March 19, 1830. His son, James Kiernan, became\r\neditor of the government paper, _Gaceta Mercantil_, in 1823, and held\r\nthis post for twenty years; his death occurred in 1857. There is\r\nreason to believe that the first Irishman who landed in Buenos Ayres\r\nin the 19th century, exclusive of Beresford's soldiers, was James\r\nCoyle, a native of Tyrone, who came in the _Agréable_ in 1807, and\r\ndied in 1876 at the age of 86.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 some survivors of an Irish colony of 300 persons in Brazil\r\nmade their way to Buenos Ayres. They had come out from Europe in the\r\nbarque _Reward_ in 1829.\r\n\r\nThe banker, Thomas Armstrong, who arrived in Buenos Ayres in 1817,\r\noccupied the foremost place for half a century in the commerce of\r\nthat city. He was of the ancient family of Armstrong in the King's\r\ncounty, one of whose members was General Sir John Armstrong, founder\r\nof Woolwich arsenal. Having married into the wealthy family of\r\nVillanueva he became intimately connected with all the leading\r\nenterprises of the day, such as railways, banks, loans, etc. He took\r\nno part in politics, but interested himself in charities of every\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 another Irishman, James P. Cahill, introduced into Peru from\r\nthe United States the first complete machinery for sugar growing and\r\nrefining.\r\n\r\nStill another Irishman, Peter Sheridan, was one of the chief founders\r\nof the sheep farming industry in Argentina. His family claimed\r\ndescent from the same stock in Co. Cavan as Richard Brinsley\r\nSheridan, the great statesman and dramatist. Sheridan died at the age\r\nof 52, in 1844, and was succeeded in the _estancia_ or sheep-farming\r\nbusiness by his nephew, James, whose brother Dr. Hugh Sheridan had\r\nserved under Admiral Brown.\r\n\r\nThe number and wealth of the Irish _estancieros_, or sheep-farmers,\r\nin Argentina have never been exactly ascertained, but after the old\r\nSpanish families they are the most important. It would be impossible\r\nto give all the Irish names to be met with. Some of them own immense\r\ntracts of land. Men whose fathers arrived in Argentina without a\r\nshilling are today worth millions. Their _estancia_ houses display\r\nall the comforts of an American or English home; their hospitality is\r\nproverbial; and most of them have built on their land fine schools\r\nand beautiful little chapels, in which the nearest Irish priest\r\nofficiates.\r\n\r\nMany of the _partidos_ or districts of the various provinces of\r\nArgentina may be compared to Irish counties, the railway stations\r\nbeing called after the owners of the land on which they are situated.\r\nAmong the earliest families settled in Argentina in the farming\r\nindustries, we find Duggans, Torneys, Harringtons, O'Briens,\r\nDowlings, Gaynors, Murphys, Moores, Dillons, O'Rorkes, Kennys, Raths,\r\nCaseys, Norrises, O'Farrells, Brownes, Hams, Duffys, Ballestys,\r\nGahans, and Garaghans.  Dr. Santiago O'Farrell, son of one of the\r\nearliest Irish pioneers, holds a foremost position among the\r\ndistinguished lawyers of the present day. An Irish engineer, Mr. John\r\nCoghlan, gave Buenos Ayres its first waterworks. The British hospital\r\nhas at present for its leading surgeon a distinguished Irishman, Dr.\r\nLuke O'Connor. A son of Peter Sheridan, educated in England, has left\r\nthe finest landscapes of South America by any artist born in America.\r\nHe died at Buenos Ayres in his 27th year, 1861. Among the public men\r\nof Irish descent, fifty years ago, in Buenos Ayres, are to be\r\nmentioned the distinguished lawyer and politician, Dalmacio Velez\r\nSarsfield, and John Dillon, commissioner of immigration. Dillon was\r\nthe first to start a brewery in Buenos Ayres, for which purpose he\r\nbrought out workmen and machinery from Europe. All of his sons\r\noccupied distinguished positions. Richard O'Shee, president of the\r\nChamber of Commerce in Buenos Ayres, was born at Seville of an old\r\nIrish family banished by William III. Among the many valuable\r\ncitizens of Buenos Ayres who perished during the cholera of 1868 was\r\nDr. Leslie, a native of Cavan, whose benevolence to the poor was\r\nunceasing. Henry O'Gorman, for some years chief of police in Buenos\r\nAyres and afterwards governor of the penitentiary, was descended from\r\nan Irish family which went to Buenos Ayres in the eighteenth century.\r\nHis brother, Canon O'Gorman, was one of the dignitaries of the\r\narchdiocese, and director of the boys' reformatory. General Donovan,\r\nson of an Irish Dr. Donovan of Buenos Ayres, had command of one of\r\nthe sections of the new Indian frontier.\r\n\r\nThe first Irish chaplain was Father Burke, a venerable friar\r\nmentioned by Mr. Love in 1820 as over 70 years of age and much\r\nesteemed. When Rivadavia suppressed the Orders in 1822, he allowed\r\nFather Burke to remain in the convent of Santo Domingo. After his\r\ndeath the Irish residents, in 1828, petitioned Archbishop Murray of\r\nDublin for a chaplain. Accordingly the Rev. Patrick Moran was\r\nselected, and he arrived in Buenos Ayres in 1829. He died in the\r\nfollowing year, and was succeeded by the Rev. Patrick O'Gorman from\r\nDublin, who continued as chaplain during 16 years till his death in\r\n1847.\r\n\r\nThe year 1843 is memorable for the arrival of Rev. Anthony Fahy, with\r\nwhose name the advancement of the Irish in Argentina will be forever\r\nidentified. This great patriarch was born at Loughrea, Co. Galway, in\r\n1804, and made his ecclesiastical studies at St. Clement's convent of\r\nIrish Dominicans at Rome. Being sent to the western states of\r\nAmerica, he passed ten years in Ohio and Kentucky, after which, on\r\nthe invitation of the Irish community of Buenos Ayres and by\r\npermission of the superior of his Order, he came to the river Plate\r\nat a time when the prospects of the country and of the Irish\r\nresidents were far from promising. The history of the Irish community\r\nsince that time is in some measure a recital of the labors of Father\r\nFahy. He it was who helped his countrymen to choose and buy their\r\nlands which now are of such enormous value. Their increasing numbers\r\nand prosperity in the camp districts obliged him to endow each of the\r\nprovincial _partidos_ was a resident chaplain. Most of these\r\nclergymen were educated in Dublin, and soon showed their zeal not\r\nmerely in religious, but also in social spheres. Irish reading-rooms,\r\nlibraries, and schools sprang up and laid the foundation for the\r\nrefined Irish life of the present day in those districts. Among other\r\nservices, Father Fahy founded the Irish convent, bringing out some\r\nSisters of Mercy under Mrs. Mary Evangelist Fitzpatrick from Dublin,\r\nto whom he gave it in charge. Father Fahy died in harness in 1871 of\r\nyellow fever; he attended a poor Italian woman and on returning home\r\nwas at once taken ill. He lasted only three days and expired\r\npeacefully, a martyr to his sacred calling. He died so poor that Mr.\r\nArmstrong had to discharge for him some small debts, and five others\r\nof his countrymen paid his funeral expenses. A fitting memorial of\r\nthe deceased priest, the Fahy College for Irish orphan boys in\r\nArgentina, has been erected in Buenos Ayres, and a magnificent\r\nmonument of Irish marble, carved in Ireland, also perpetuates his\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nThe priests, still living, who were co-workers with Father Fahy and\r\nappointed by him to various _partidos_, are Monsignor Samuel\r\nO'Reilly, deservedly beloved by his parishioners, and the Rev. Father\r\nFlannery, whose appointment to San Pedro brought a great influx of\r\nIrish farmers into that district. Among those who have gone to enjoy\r\ntheir eternal reward are the brothers, Rev. Michael and Rev. John\r\nLeahy, both of whom were indefatigable during the yellow fever in\r\nBuenos Ayres. Rev. Father Mulleady, Rev. Patrick Lynch, Rev. James\r\nCurran, and Monsignor Curley were also among the Irish priests of\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nThe Fahy College is entrusted to the care of the Marist Brothers, who\r\nare largely Irish. The community of Holy Cross of the Passionist\r\nFathers, who have as provincial the distinguished North American\r\nscholar Father Fidelis Kent Stone, is almost entirely composed of\r\nIrish and Irish-Americans. They have several establishments in\r\nvarious provinces of Argentina. Irish priests are to be met with all\r\nover the country. In Patagonia and the Chaco we also find a number of\r\nProtestant missionaries sent out by the Irish branch of the South\r\nAmerican Missionary Society.\r\n\r\nArchdeacon Dillon succeeded Father Fahy as Irish chaplain in Buenos\r\nAyres, and, although by birth and education an Irishman, he became\r\none of the principal dignitaries of the archdiocese. He was for some\r\ntime professor of theology in the ecclesiastical seminary of Buenos\r\nAyres, and accompanied Archbishop Escalada as theologian to the\r\nVatican Council in 1869. He was the founder of the _Southern Cross_\r\nin 1874, the Irish weekly paper which is now so ably edited by the\r\ngifted Irishman, Mr. Gerald Foley.\r\n\r\nThe first daily paper to appear in English in South America was the\r\n_Standard_, founded in 1861 by Michael G. Mulhall, the distinguished\r\nstatistician, and it is still one of the leading papers in the\r\ncountry. In conducting it Michael G. Mulhall was joined by his\r\nbrother, Edward T. Mulhall, in 1862, and for many years it was\r\ncontinuously under their care. The _Standard_ still remains in the\r\nMulhall family, and has for its editor a cousin of the former\r\neditor's, Mr. John Mulhall, who wisely directs its course. The\r\n_Argentina_, an important paper in Spanish, was founded a few years\r\nsince by Edward T. Mulhall, Jr., a brilliant son of the late Edward\r\nMulhall of the _Standard_. The _Hyberno-Argentine Review_, a new\r\nIrish weekly, is edited by another able Irishman, James B. Sheridan.\r\nIn Rio Janeiro the _Anglo-Brasilian Times_ was founded in 1864 by an\r\nIrishman, Mr. Scully, who also wrote an important book on Brazil.\r\n\r\nIreland had also its representatives in South American diplomacy and\r\nthe making of treaties. As early as 1809 Colonel James Burke was sent\r\nby Lord Strangford, British minister at Rio, on a confidential\r\nmission to Buenos Ayres to negotiate the establishment of a separate\r\nkingdom on the river Plate, with the Princess Charlotte as queen. In\r\n1867 Mr. Gould, an Irishman, British chargé d'affaires, endeavored to\r\nmediate between the allies, Brazil and Argentina, and President Lopez\r\nof Paraguay, but without success. Stephen H. Sullivan, British chargé\r\nd'affaires for Chile, signed the treaty of commerce and navigation\r\nbetween England and Chile on the 10th of May, 1852. He was afterwards\r\nappointed British minister at Lima, where he was murdered. The late\r\nChilian ministers to Buenos Ayres and London, William Blest Gana and\r\nAlbert Blest Gana, were the sons of an Irish Doctor Blest from Sligo,\r\nwho settled in Chile. In 1859 George Fagan signed a treaty with\r\nGeneral Guido for compensation of losses to British subjects during\r\nthe civil wars after the Independence.\r\n\r\nThe mining industry had among its pioneers brave sons of Erin. J. O.\r\nFrench went to Buenos Ayres in 1826, and after an arduous mountain\r\njourney arrived at the foot of the Cerro Morado, where he found\r\nauriferous ores. Chevalier Edmond Temple, an Irish gentleman who had\r\nserved in Spain in a dragoon regiment, also landed in Buenos Ayres in\r\n1826, and started across the Pampas, then almost uninhabited, until\r\nhe came to the mountainous country where the Potosi mines were\r\nsituated. In one of the defiles he lost his favorite horse, and in\r\nhis book he bids a touching farewell to the friendly steed which had\r\nshared with him so many toils and dangers. Temple's successor in the\r\nArgentine mining provinces was Major Rickard Seaver, a member of an\r\nold Co. Dublin family.\r\n\r\nSeveral books of travel in South America have been published by Irish\r\nwriters during the last fifty years. MacCann's _Travels in the\r\nArgentine Provinces_, 1846-49, contains much that is valuable\r\nconcerning the history and manners of the country. Major Rickard\r\nSeaver issued in 1863 an interesting narrative of his crossing the\r\nAndes. Consul Hutchinson, an Irishman, published in 1864 his book\r\n_Argentine Gleanings_, which was followed by another in 1869 called\r\n_South American Recollections_. Robert Crawford, an Irish engineer,\r\nled an expedition from Buenos Ayres in November, 1871, across the\r\nIndian Pampas and over the pass of the Planchon in the Andes, to\r\nsurvey an overland route to Chile, and subsequently published an\r\ninteresting account of his journey. The first book printed and\r\npublished in English, in South America, was the _Handbook of the\r\nRiver Plate_, written by Michael G. Mulhall and published by the\r\n_Standard_, in 1861. The same author also published the _Rural Code\r\nof Buenos Ayres_ in 1867, and the _Handbook of Brazil_ in 1877. In\r\n1871 he published an account of his travels among the German colonies\r\nin Rio Grande do Sul. Twenty years ago the writer of this sketch\r\npublished _Between the Amazon and the Andes_ and the _Story of the\r\nJesuit Missions of Paraguay_. These books derive special interest\r\nfrom the fact that she was the first foreign woman ever seen in\r\nCuyaba, the capital of Matto Grosso, whither she accompanied her\r\nhusband, 2500 miles from either the Atlantic or the Pacific seaboard.\r\nThey arrived as far as the Diamantina Mountains, beyond Cuyaba, and\r\nsaw the little rivers which form the sources of the mighty Amazon.\r\n\r\nCasting a glance over South America, we see in every country and\r\nprovince evidences of Irish genius employed not only in fighting but\r\nin the development of natural resources. To quote Consul Cowper's\r\nreport to the Foreign Office in London: \"The progress of Buenos Ayres\r\nis mainly due to the industrious Irish sheep farmers.\" No other\r\nnationality contributed so largely to the export trade of the\r\ncountry. At one time it was shown by the tables of Mr. Duggan and\r\nother wool exporters that the quantity of this staple industry yearly\r\nsold by Irishmen in Buenos Ayres exceeded that sold by all other\r\nnationalities. In later years the Irish sheep farmers in the province\r\nof Buenos Ayres have turned their lands into wheat lands, and the\r\ngreat industries of the country, sheep and cattle, have been moved to\r\nthe outside camps, especially to that wonderful grazing region in the\r\nAndine valleys recently visited by Col. Roosevelt and his party. It\r\nmay be interesting to mention that at the first English races ever\r\nheld in South America, on November 6, 1826, the principal event, in\r\nwhich ten horses ran, was easily won by an Irish horse with the\r\nappropriate name of \"Shamrock.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nBeaumont: Travels In Buenos Ayres (1828); Wilson: Travels In South\r\nAmerica (1796); Pinkerton: Travels (1808), Captain Weddell: Cape Horn\r\nand South Atlantic Surveys; Major Gillesple: Buenos Ayres and\r\nProvinces; Mrs. Williams, on Humboldt's Travels (1826); Captain\r\nMaster: At Home with the Patagonians (1891); Hadfield: Notes of\r\nTravel in Brazil and La plata (1863); Hinchcliff: South American\r\nSketches (1862); Captain Burton: Highlands of Brazil; Ross Johnston:\r\nA Vacation in the Argentine Alps (1867); MacCann: Travels in the\r\nArgentine Provinces (1846-1849); Hutchinson: Argentine Gleanings and\r\nSouth American Recollections; Major Seaver: Crossing the Andes;\r\nCrawford: Across the Pampas; V.

Flynn. He had heard in Rome of the\r\nspiritual destitution of the Irish Catholics in Australia, and he\r\nsecured the permission of his superiors to minister to the needs of\r\nhis compatriots in the Antipodes. Shortly after his arrival he\r\ncelebrated Mass in the house of an Irishman named William Davis, who\r\nhad been transported for making pikes for the insurgents in the days\r\nof '98, and then, on the first opportunity that presented itself, he\r\nsought the authorization of the colonial governor to exercise the\r\nfunctions of his sacred ministry. Far from hospitable was the\r\nreception accorded him by Governor Macquarie. The priest was told,\r\nwith the bluntness characteristic of British officialdom, that the\r\npresence of no \"popish missionary\" would be tolerated in the\r\nsettlement, and that the profession of the Protestant form of belief\r\nwas obligatory on every person in the penal colony.\r\n\r\nWith the example of the \"priesthood hunted down like wolves\" before\r\nhim, Father Flynn saw but one consistent course to pursue. His fellow\r\nCatholics, his fellow Irishmen, were in sore need of his help; that\r\nhelp they must receive, even though the civil powers refused their\r\nsanction. So for several months he went about as secretly as he\r\ncould, hearing confessions, offering the Holy Sacrifice, and breaking\r\nthe bread of good counsel. During this trying period, Davis was his\r\nhost and defender and friend. Eventually the presence of the priest\r\nwas detected; he was arrested and promptly sent back to England.\r\nBefore the ship sailed he tried repeatedly to return to the house of\r\nDavis where the Blessed Sacrament was preserved in a cedar\r\nclothes-press, but the surveillance of his captors was strict and\r\nunsleeping. So in the dwelling of the convict Irishman the Sacred\r\nSpecies remained. Before this unwonted repository Davis kept a light\r\never burning day and night; and day and night crept the loyal\r\nIrishmen of the settlement to kneel in prayer before the improvised\r\nshrine. The \"Holy House of Australia\", as the Davis dwelling came to\r\nbe known, remained the only Catholic church in the colony until 1821,\r\nwhen two Irish priests, Father John Joseph Therry of Cork and Father\r\nPhilip Connolly of Kildare, were permitted to attend to the spiritual\r\nneeds of the Irish Catholics. Their coming marked the beginning of\r\nreligious toleration in Australia and the termination of the\r\nsufferings and sacrifices of the Irish colonists, several of whom had\r\nhad to pay dearly for their religious convictions. Davis himself had\r\nbeen twice flogged and once imprisoned for refusing to attend\r\nProtestant service.\r\n\r\nToday, on the site of the \"Holy House of Australia\", stands the\r\nchurch of St. Patrick. Davis gave the land and the sum of one\r\nthousand pounds to the church, and his fellow exiles contributed\r\naccording to their means. This episode in the history of the Irish in\r\nAustralia pays a touchingly eloquent tribute to the spirit of loyalty\r\nto God and country which has characterized the sons and daughters of\r\nSt. Patrick everywhere whither their feet have strayed. It is the\r\nspirit which has embodied itself in the imposing cathedral of St.\r\nPatrick in Melbourne and the splendidly equipped college of St.\r\nPatrick in Sydney. It is the spirit which has made the Irish play so\r\nconspicuous a role in the civic and commercial history of\r\nAustralasia.\r\n\r\nOriginally known as New Holland, Australia became an English penal\r\ncolony after the outbreak of the Revolutionary War in the United\r\nStates of America. An Irish element came into the colony in the last\r\ndecade of the eighteenth century when, during the Orange reign of\r\nterror, upwards of a thousand people from the west of Ireland were\r\ndeported by the Ulster magistrates and by Lord Carhampton, the\r\nnotorious \"Satanides\", who was charged with the pacification of\r\nConnacht. And during the first three decades of the nineteenth\r\ncentury the stream of Irish transportation flowed on. As a result of\r\nthe Tithes agitation, the Charter and Reform movements, the\r\nCombination Laws and the Corn Laws, many more Irishmen were forced\r\nacross the sea. It was not until 1868 that the convict system was\r\npermanently abolished.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us of a later day to realize the meaning of that\r\nword, transportation. Let us form some conception of what the Irish\r\nexiles suffered from the graphic picture painted in colors, somber\r\nbut not untrue, by one who knew from firsthand experience the lot of\r\nthe political prisoner. Writes Dr. Ullathorne in _The Horrors of\r\nTransportation_:\r\n\r\n\"Take any one of you, my dear readers; separate him from his wife,\r\nfrom his children, from all those whose conversation makes life dear\r\nto him; cast him on the ends of the earth; let him there fall amongst\r\nreprobates who are the last stain and disgrace of our common nature;\r\ngive him those obscene-mouthed monsters for his constant companions\r\nand consolers; let the daily vision of their progress from infamy to\r\ninfamy, until the demon that inspires them has exhausted invention\r\nand the powers of nature together, be his only example; house him, at\r\nnight, in a bark hut on a mud floor, where he has less comfort than\r\nyour cattle in their stalls; awake him from the troubled dreams of\r\nhis wretched wife and outcast children, to feel how far he is from\r\ntheir help, and take him out at sunrise; work him under a burning\r\nsun, and a heartless overseer, and the threat of the lash until the\r\nnight fall; give him not a penny's wages but sorrow; leave him no\r\nhope but the same dull, dreary round of endless drudgery for many\r\nyears to come; let him see no opening by which to escape, but through\r\na long, narrow prospect of police courts, of gaols, of triangles, of\r\ndeath cells, and of penal settlements; let him all the while be\r\nclothed in a dress of shame, that shows to every living soul his\r\ndegradation; and if he dare to sell any part of that clothing, then\r\nflog him worse than any dog! And thus, whilst severed from all\r\nkindness and all love, whilst the stern harsh voice of his\r\ntask-master is grating in incessant jars within his ear, take all\r\nrest out of his flesh, and plant the thorn; take all feeling out of\r\nhis heart, and leave the withered core; take all peace out of his\r\nconscience, and leave the worm of remorse; and then let any one come\r\nand dare to tell me that the man is happy because he has bread and\r\nmeat. Is it not here, if ever there was such a case, where the taste\r\nof bread is a taste of misery, and where to feed and prolong life is\r\nto feed and lengthen our sorrow? And in pondering these things, do\r\nnot those strong words of Sacred Scripture bring down their load of\r\ntruth in heavy trouble to our thoughts, that, 'Their bread is\r\nloathsome to their eye, and their meat unto their soul.'\"\r\n\r\nBut the bright side of the story of the Irish in Australia and New\r\nZealand unfolds in the subsequent years. The men who had been sent\r\nforth from Erin with the brand of the convict upon them became the\r\nfounders of a new commonwealth. To them were joined the numerous\r\nvoluntary settlers who, attracted by the natural resources of the\r\nisland-continent and especially by the gold discoveries of the\r\nfifties, migrated to Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales. When\r\nin 1858 William E. Gladstone sought to establish a new colony to be\r\nknown as North Australia, he opened a fresh field for Irish\r\ninitiative. As a result of his effort there stands today, on a\r\nterrace overlooking Port Curtis, the city of Gladstone, the terminal\r\nof the Australian railway system. It was here, according to Cardinal\r\nMoran, that in 1606, Mass was first celebrated in Australia, when the\r\nSpaniards sought shelter in the \"Harbor of the Holy Cross.\" The first\r\ngovernment resident at Gladstone was Sir Maurice Charles O'Connell, a\r\nrelative of the great Liberator; he was four times acting-governor of\r\nQueensland.\r\n\r\nThe list of Irish pioneer settlers in Australasia is a lengthy one.\r\nThe name of Thomas Poynton stands out prominently. He was a New\r\nZealand pioneer who had married an Irish girl in Sydney. The devotion\r\nof Poynton and his wife to the faith of their fathers is evidenced by\r\nthe fact that he several times made the long journey from his home to\r\nSydney to interest the church authorities in the wants of the New\r\nZealand Irish Catholics, and that she twice made the same arduous\r\ntrip to have her children baptized. Thomas Mooney has the distinction\r\nof being the first Irish pioneer in Western Australia; and yet\r\nanother Irishman, Cassidy by name, carried out a policy of benevolent\r\nassimilation by marrying the daughter of a Maori chief.\r\n\r\nAmong the pioneer ecclesiastics were Father William Kelly of\r\nMelbourne and Father John McEncroe, a native of Tipperary and a\r\nMaynooth man, who for thirty years and more was a prominent figure in\r\nthe religious and civic life of New South Wales. Father John Brady,\r\nanother pioneer priest, became Bishop of Perth. Irish names occupy a\r\nconspicuous and honored place in the roster of the Australian\r\nepiscopate. Notable on the list are Bishop Francis Murphy of\r\nAdelaide, who was born in Co. Meath, and Archbishop Daniel Murphy of\r\nSydney, a native of Cork, the man who delivered the eulogy on the\r\noccasion of Daniel O'Connell's funeral at Rome. But scant reference\r\ncan here be made to the illustrious primate of Australia, Cardinal\r\nMoran, archbishop of Sydney from 1884 to 1911, who was such a potent\r\nforce in the land of his adoption, and whose masterly _History of the\r\nCatholic Church in Australasia_ puts him in the forefront of\r\necclesiastical historians. On his death he was succeeded in the see\r\nof Sydney by another Irishman, Archbishop Michael Kelly of Waterford.\r\nArchbishop O'Reily of Adelaide is a recognized authority on music,\r\nand has written several pamphlets on that subject. A Galway man, Dr.\r\nT. J. Carr, a great educator, is now (1914) archbishop of Melbourne,\r\nand a Clare man, Dr. J. P. Clune, holds sway in Perth.\r\n\r\nIrishmen in Australia have figured largely in the iron and coal\r\nindustries, in the irrigation projects, in the manufacturing\r\nactivities, and in the working of the gold mines. But they have\r\nlikewise distinguished themselves in other fields of endeavor.\r\nProminent on the beadroll of Australian fame stand the names of Sir\r\nCharles Gavan Duffy (1816-1903), founder of the _Nation_ newspaper in\r\nDublin, member of the British house of commons, and afterwards\r\npremier of Victoria and speaker of the legislative assembly, and his\r\nsons, John Gavan Duffy and Frank Gavan Duffy, public-spirited\r\ncitizens and authorities on legal matters. The Currans, father and\r\nson, active in the public life of Sydney, were afterwards members of\r\nthe British parliament. Distinguished in the records of the\r\nAustralian judiciary are Judges Quinlan, Casey, Brennan, and O'Dowd.\r\nThe Rev. J. Milne Curran, F.G.S., is a geologist who has achieved\r\nmore than local fame. Other Irishmen who have loomed large in\r\nAustralasian affairs are Daniel Brophy, John Cumin, Augustus Leo\r\nKenny, James Coghlan, Sir Patrick Buckley, Sir John O'Shannessy, and\r\nNicholas Fitzgerald. Louis C. Brennan, C.B., who was born in Ireland\r\nin 1852, emigrated to Australia when a boy and while working in a\r\ncivil engineer's office in Melbourne conceived the idea of the\r\n\"Brennan Torpedo\", which he afterwards perfected, and then in 1897\r\nsold the invention to the British Admiralty for £110,000. Another\r\nBrennan, Frank by name, is president of the Knights of Our Lady of\r\nthe Southern Cross and has been a labor member of the federal\r\nparliament since 1911; a third, Christopher John, is assistant\r\nlecturer in modern literature in the University of Sydney; and a\r\nfourth, James, of the diocese of Perth, was made a Knight of St.\r\nSilvester by Pius X. in 1912. Young Australia and New Zealand may be\r\nas the world goes, but already both have much to their credit in the\r\ndomains of music, art, and literature; and here, as usual, the Irish\r\nhave been to the fore. In the writing of poetry, history, and fiction\r\nthe Celtic element has been especially distinguished. Not to speak of\r\nthe writers mentioned elsewhere in this sketch, scores of Irish men\r\nand women have been identified with the development of an Australian\r\nliterature which, though delightfully redolent of the land whence it\r\nsprang, nevertheless possesses the universal note which makes it a\r\ntruly human product. Many years ago one of the most gifted of\r\nIrish-Australian singers, \"Eva\"' of the _Nation_, voiced a tentative\r\nplaint:\r\n\r\n      \"O barren land! O blank, bright sky!\r\n         Methinks it were a noble duty\r\n      To kindle in that vacant eye\r\n         The light of spirit--beauty--\r\n      To fill with airy shapes divine\r\n         Thy lonely plains and mountains,\r\n      The orange grove, the bower of vine,\r\n         The silvery lakes and fountains;\r\n      To wake the voiceless, silent air\r\n         To soft, melodious numbers;\r\n      To raise thy lifeless form so fair\r\n         From those deep, spell-bound slumbers.\r\n      Oh, whose shall be the potent hand\r\n         To give that touch informing,\r\n      And make thee rise, O Southern Land,\r\n         To life and poesy warming?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. O'Doherty herself, who long lived in that Queensland which she\r\nthus apostrophized, helped in no uncertain way to answer her own\r\nquestion. So did John Farrell, the author of the truly remarkable\r\n\"Jubilee Ode\" of 1897 and of a collection of poems which include the\r\nwell known \"How He Died.\" And so, long before, had the non-Catholic\r\nIrishman, Edward O'Shaughnessy, who went to Australia as a convict,\r\nbut who laughed in lockstep and made music with his chains.\r\n\r\nJames Francis Hogan, author and journalist, was born in Tipperary in\r\n1855 and shortly afterward was brought by his parents to Melbourne\r\nwhere he received his education. On his return to Ireland he was\r\nelected to represent his native county in parliament. He is an\r\nauthority on Australian history and in his book on _The Gladstone\r\nColony_ has given us a fine specimen of modern historical method.\r\nWith him must be mentioned Roderick Flanagan, whose _History of New\r\nSouth Wales_ appeared in 1862.\r\n\r\nOther Irish names distinguished in Australasian literature are those\r\nof the New Zealand poet, Thomas Bracken; Roderick Quinn; Desmond\r\nByrne; J.B. O'Hara; the eccentric convict-writer, George \"Barrington\"\r\nWaldron; Victor J. Daley; Bernard O'Dowd; Edwin J. Brady; the Rev.\r\nJ.J. Malone; and the Rev. W. Kelly.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Irish in Australia have done more than their share in\r\nthe work of education and social service. Under Irish auspices\r\nseveral of the Catholic teaching congregations, including the\r\nChristian Brothers and the Presentation Nuns, were introduced, and\r\ntheir work has borne goodly fruit. A mighty power for good is the\r\nHibernian Australasian Benefit Society. The organization, which was\r\nfounded in 1871, has spread rapidly and has a large active\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\nTruly the land of the Southern Cross is not the dimmest jewel in the\r\ncoronet of Ireland's glories.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nHogan: The Irish in Australia (1888), The Gladstone Colony (1898);\r\nMennell: Dictionary of Australian Biography (1892); Duffy: Life in\r\nTwo Hemispheres (1903); Kenny: The Catholic Church in Australia to\r\nthe Year 1840; Moran: History of the Catholic Church in Australasia\r\n(1898); Davitt: Life and Progress in Australasia (1898); Bonwick: The\r\nFirst Twenty Years of Australia (1883); Flanagan: History of New\r\nSouth Wales (1862); Byrne: Australian Writers (1896); Wilson: The\r\nChurch in New Zealand (1910); Hocken: A Bibliography of the\r\nLiterature Relating to New Zealand (1909).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH IN SOUTH AFRICA\r\n\r\nBy A. MILLIARD ATTERIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tide of emigration from Ireland has set chiefly towards America\r\nand Australia. In South Africa, therefore, the Irish element among\r\nthe colonists has never been a large one. But, despite its\r\ncomparatively small numbers, it has been an important factor in the\r\nlife of South Africa. Here, as in so many other countries, it has\r\nbeen the glory of the sons of Erin to be a missionary people. To\r\ntheir coming is due the very existence of the Catholic Church in\r\nthese southern lands.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Ullathorne touched at the Cape on his way to Australia in\r\n1832, he found at Cape Town \"a single priest for the whole of South\r\nAfrica,\" an English Benedictine, who soon afterwards returned to\r\nEurope in broken health. Few Irish immigrants had by that time found\r\ntheir way to the Cape. They began to arrive in numbers only after the\r\nfamine year.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Catholic hierarchy in South Africa was the Irish\r\nDominican, Patrick R. Griffith, who, in 1837, was sent to Cape Town\r\nby Gregory XVI. as the first Vicar Apostolic of Cape Colony. His\r\nsuccessors at the Cape, Bishops Grimley, Leonard, and Rooney, have\r\nall been Irishmen, and nine in every ten of their flock have from the\r\nfirst been Irish by birth or descent. In the earlier years of Bishop\r\nGriffith's episcopate there was a large garrison in South Africa on\r\naccount of the Kaffir wars. Many of these soldiers were Irishmen. At\r\nGrahamstown in 1844 the soldiers of an Irish regiment stationed there\r\ndid most of the work of building St. Patrick's Church, one of the\r\noldest Catholic churches in South Africa. They worked without wages\r\nor reward of any kind, purely out of their devotion to their Faith,\r\ngiving up most of their leisure to this voluntary labor.\r\n\r\nTen years after Bishop Griffith's appointment, Pius IX. separated\r\nNatal and the eastern districts of Cape Colony from Cape Town, and\r\nerected the Eastern Vicariate Apostolic. Once more an Irish prelate\r\nwas the first Bishop--Aidan Devereux, who was consecrated by Bishop\r\nGriffith at Cape Town in the Christmas week of 1847. The great\r\nemigration from Ireland had now begun, and a stream of immigrants was\r\narriving at the Cape. Bishop Devereux fixed his residence at Port\r\nElizabeth, and of his four successors up to the present day three\r\nhave been Irish. Bishop Moran, who went out to Port Elizabeth in\r\n1854, was consecrated at Carlow in Ireland by Archbishop (afterwards\r\nCardinal) Cullen. The third Vicar Apostolic was Bishop Ricards, and\r\nthe present bishop is another Irishman, Dr. Hugh McSherry, who\r\nreceived his consecration from the hands of Cardinal Logue in St.\r\nPatrick's Cathedral at Armagh.\r\n\r\nUntil the discovery of the diamond deposits in what is now the\r\nKimberley district, some forty years ago, the Irish immigrants had\r\nchiefly settled in the ports and along the coast. But among the\r\ncrowds who went to seek their fortunes at the diamond fields were\r\nlarge numbers of adventurous Irishmen. The mission church established\r\nat Kimberley became the centre of a new bishopric in 1886, when the\r\nVicariate of Kimberley, which for some time included the Orange Free\r\nState, was established, and an Irish Oblate, Father Anthony Gaughran,\r\nwas appointed its first bishop. He was succeeded in 1901 by his\r\nnamesake and fellow countryman, the present Bishop Matthew Gaughran.\r\n\r\nThe gold discoveries on the Witwatersrand about Johannesburg produced\r\nanother rush into the interior in the days after the first Transvaal\r\nwar. A great city of foreign immigrants--the \"Uitlanders\"--grew up\r\nrapidly on the upland, where a few months before there had been only\r\na few scattered Boer farms. Irishmen from Cape Colony and Natal, from\r\nIreland itself, and from the United States formed a large element in\r\nthe local mining and trading community. They were mostly workers. Few\r\nof them found their way into the controlling financier class, which\r\nwas largely Jewish. The Irish were better out of this circle of\r\ninternational gamblers, whose intrigues finally produced the terrible\r\ntwo years' bloodshed of the great South African war. Many engineers\r\nof the mines were Irish-Americans. Huge consignments of mining\r\nmachinery arrived from the United States, and many of the engineers\r\nwho came to fit it up remained in the employ of the mining companies.\r\nUntil after the war, the Transvaal and Johannesburg had depended\r\necclesiastically on the Vicar Apostolic of Natal, but in 1904 a\r\nTransvaal Vicariate was erected, and once more the first bishop was\r\nan Irishman, Dr. William Miller, O.M.I.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how Irish the South African episcopate has been from the\r\nvery outset. Most of the clergy belong to the same missionary race,\r\nas also do the nuns of the various convents, and the Christian\r\nBrothers, who are in charge of many of the schools. Of the white\r\nCatholic population of the various states of the South African Union,\r\nthe greater part are Irish. There are about 25,000 Irish in Cape\r\nColony in a total population of over two millions. There are some\r\n7,000 in Natal, I,500 in Kimberley, and about 2,000 in the Orange\r\nRiver Colony. In the Transvaal, chiefly in and about Johannesburg,\r\nthere are some 12,000 Irish. A few thousand more are to be found\r\nscattered in Griqualand and Rhodesia.\r\n\r\nAs has been already said, the total numbers are not large in\r\nproportion to that of the population generally, and they belong\r\nchiefly to the industrial and trading classes. The most notable names\r\namong them are those of prelates, priests, and missionaries, who have\r\nfounded and built up the organization of the Catholic Church in South\r\nAfrica. But there are some names of note also in civil life. Sir\r\nMichael Gallwey was for many years Chief Justice of Natal; the Hon.\r\nA. Wilmot, who has not only held high official posts, but has also\r\ndone much to clear up the early history of South Africa, is Irish on\r\nthe mother's side; Mr. Justice Shiel is a judge of the Cape Courts;\r\nEyre and Woodbyrne are Irish names among the makers of Rhodesia; and\r\namongst those who have done remarkable work in official life may also\r\nbe named Sir Geoffrey Lagden, Sir William St. John Carr, and the Hon.\r\nJohn Daverin. Lagden was for many years British Resident in\r\nBasutoland, the Switzerland of South Africa, where the native tribes\r\nare practically independent under a British protectorate. Griffith,\r\nthe paramount chief of the Basuto nation, has been a Catholic since\r\n1911. Sir Geoffrey's tactful policy and wise counsels did much to\r\npromote the prosperity of this native state, and during the trying\r\ndays of the South African War, he was able to secure the neutrality\r\nof the tribesmen.\r\n\r\nIn the Boer wars, Irishmen fought with distinction on both sides.\r\nGeneral Colley, who fell at Majuba in the first Boer War, was a\r\ndistinguished Irish soldier. Another great Irishman, General Sir\r\nWilliam Butler, has written the story of Colley's life. Butler\r\nhimself was in command of the troops at the Cape before the great\r\nwar. If his wise counsels had been followed by the Government, the\r\nwar would undoubtedly have been avoided. He refused to have any part\r\nin the war-provoking policy of Rhodes and Chamberlain, and warned the\r\nHome Government that an attack on the Dutch republics would be a\r\nserious and perilous enterprise. When the war came, England owed much\r\nto the enduring valor of Irish soldiers and to the leadership of\r\nIrish generals. One need only name General Hart, of the Irish\r\nBrigade; General French, who relieved Kimberley, and who is now\r\n(1914) Field-Marshal and Commander-in-Chief of the British army in\r\nFrance; General Mahon, who raised the siege of Mafeking; Colonel\r\nMoore, of the famous Connaught Rangers, now (1914) commandant and\r\nchief military organizer of the Irish National Volunteers; and,\r\nfinally, Lord Roberts, who took over the chief command and saved the\r\nsituation after the early disasters. Lord Kitchener, who acted as\r\nRoberts's chief-of-staff, succeeded him in the command, and brought\r\nthe war to an end by an honorable treaty with the Boer leaders, is a\r\nnative of Ireland, but of English descent, and he passed most of his\r\nboyhood in Ireland, in Co. Kerry, where his father had bought a small\r\nproperty. I used to know an Irish Franciscan lay brother who told me\r\nhe had taught the future soldier \"many games\" when he was quite a\r\nlittle fellow.\r\n\r\nOf the regiments which took part in the war none won a higher fame\r\nthan the Munster and the Dublin Fusiliers and the Connaught Rangers.\r\nIt was in recognition of their splendid valor that the new regiment\r\nof Irish Guards was added to the British Army.\r\n\r\nBut the majority of Irishmen sympathized with the Boer republics, and\r\nmany of them fought under the Boer flag, of these were legally\r\nBritish subjects, but many were naturalized burghers of the\r\nTransvaal, and many more were United States citizens, Irish-Americans\r\nfrom the Rand gold mines. There were two small Irish brigades under\r\nthe Boer flag, those of McBride and Lynch (the latter now a member of\r\nthe British House of Commons), and an engineer corps commanded by\r\nColonel Blake, an American. At the first battle before Ladysmith it\r\nwas one of the Irish brigades that kept the Boer guns in action,\r\nbringing up ammunition under a rain of shellfire. During the Boer\r\nretreat and Roberts's advance on Pretoria, Blake's engineers were\r\nalways with the Boer rearguard and successfully destroyed every mile\r\nof the railway as they went back. Blake had served in the United\r\nStates cavalry, had learned mining while on duty in Nevada, and had\r\nthen gone to seek his fortune at Johannesburg. The great leader of\r\nthe Boer armies, now the Prime Minister of the new South Africa which\r\nhas happily arisen out of the storm of war, has Irish connections.\r\nLouis Botha lived before the war in the southeast Transvaal, not far\r\nfrom Laings Nek, and near neighbors of his were a family of Irish\r\nsettlers bearing the honored name of Emmet. The Emmets and the Bothas\r\nwere united by ties of friendship and intermarriage, and one of the\r\nEmmets served with Louis Botha during the war.\r\n\r\nThe Irish colonists of South Africa keep their love for faith and\r\nfatherland, but, as in the United States, they have thoroughly and\r\nloyally thrown in their lot with the new country of which they have\r\nbecome citizens. Few in number though they are, they are an important\r\nfactor in the new Dominion, for their national tradition inspires\r\nthem with civic patriotism, and their religion gives them a high\r\nstandard of conduct and puts before them, as guides in the work of\r\nlife and the solution of the problems of the day, the Christian\r\nprinciples of justice and charity.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nGovernment Census Returns, South Africa; Catholic Directory for\r\nBritish South Africa (Cape Town, since 1904); The Catholic Magazine,\r\nCape Town; Wilmot and Chase: History of Cape Colony (London, 1896);\r\nTheal: History of South Africa (5 vols., London, 1888-1893); for the\r\nwar period, the _Times_ History of the South African War, and the\r\nBritish Official History.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH LANGUAGE AND LETTERS\r\n\r\nBy DOUGLAS HYDE, LL.D., M.R.I.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Celtic languages consist of two divisions, (a) the Gaelic or\r\nIrish division, and (b) the Kymric or Welsh division. Between them\r\nthey comprise (a) Irish, Scotch-Gaelic, and Manx, and (b) Welsh,\r\nArmorican, and Cornish. All these languages are still alive except\r\nCornish, which died out about a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nOf all these languages Irish is the best preserved, and it is\r\npossible to follow its written literature back into the past for some\r\nthirteen hundred years; while much of the most interesting matter has\r\ncome down to us from pagan times. It has left behind it the longest,\r\nthe most luminous, and the most consecutive literary track of any of\r\nthe vernacular languages of Europe, except Greek alone.\r\n\r\nFor centuries the Irish and their language were regarded by the\r\nEnglish as something strange and foreign to Europe. It was not\r\nrecognized that they had any relationship with the Greeks or Romans,\r\nthe French, the Germans, or the English. The once well-known\r\nstatesman, Lord Lyndhurst, in the British parliament denounced the\r\nIrish as aliens in religion, in blood, and in language. Bopp, in his\r\ngreat Comparative Grammar, refused them recognition as\r\nIndo-Europeans, and Pott in 1856 also denied their European\r\nconnection. It was left for the great Bavarian scholar, John Caspar\r\nZeuss, to prove to the world in his epoch-making \"Grammatica Celtica\"\r\n(published in Latin in 1853) that the Celts were really\r\nIndo-Europeans, and that their language was of the highest possible\r\nvalue and interest. From that day to the present it is safe to say\r\nthat the value set upon the Irish language and literature has been\r\nsteadily growing amongst the scholars of the world, and that in the\r\ndomain of philology Old Irish now ranks close to Sanscrit for its\r\ntruly marvellous and complicated scheme of word-forms and\r\ninflections, and its whole verbal system.\r\n\r\nThe exact place which the Celtic languages (of which Irish is\r\nphilologically far the most important) hold in the Indo-European\r\ngroup has often been discussed. It is now generally agreed upon that,\r\nalthough both the Celtic and Teutonic languages may claim a certain\r\nkinship with each other as being both of them Indo-European, still\r\nthe Celtic is much more nearly related to the Greek and the Latin\r\ngroups, especially to the Latin.\r\n\r\nAll the Indo-European languages are more or less related to one\r\nanother. We Irish must acknowledge a relationship, or rather a very\r\ndistant connecting tie, with English. But, to trace this home, Irish\r\nmust be followed back to the very oldest form of its words, and\r\nEnglish must be followed back to Anglo-Saxon and when possible to\r\nGothic. The hard mutes (p, t, c) of Celtic (and, for that matter, of\r\nSanscrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Slavonic, and Lithuanian) will be\r\nrepresented in Gothic by the corresponding soft mutes (b, d, g), and\r\nthe soft mutes in Celtic by the corresponding, hard mutes in Gothic.\r\nThus we find the Irish _dia_ (god) in the Anglo-Saxon _tiw_, the god\r\nof war, whose name is perpetuated for all time in Tiwes-däg, now\r\n\"Tuesday\", and we find the Irish _déad_ in the Anglo-Saxon \"toth\",\r\nnow \"tooth\", and so on. But of all the Indo-European languages Old\r\nIrish possesses by far the nearest affinity to Latin, and this is\r\nshown in a great many ways, not in the vocabulary merely, but in the\r\ngrammar, which for philologists is of far more importance,--as, for\r\nexample, the _b_-future, the passive in-_r_, the genitive singular\r\nand nominative plural of \"o stems\", etc. Thus the Old Irish for\r\n\"man\", nom. _fer_, gen. _fir_, dat. _fiur_, acc. _fer n_--, plur.\r\nnom. _fir_, gen. _fer n_--, is derived from the older forms _viros,\r\nviri, viro, viron_, nom. plur. _viri_, gen. plur. _viron_, which\r\neveryone who knows Latin can see at a glance correspond very closely\r\nto the Latin inflections, _vir, viri, viro, virum_, nom. plur.\r\n_viri_, etc.\r\n\r\nSo much for the language. When did this language begin to be used in\r\nliterature? This question depends upon another--When did the Irish\r\nbegin to have a knowledge of letters; when did they begin to commit\r\ntheir literature to writing; and whence did they borrow their\r\nknowledge of this art?\r\n\r\nThe oldest alphabet used in Ireland of which remains exist appears to\r\nhave been the Ogam, which is found in numbers of stone inscriptions\r\ndating from about the third century of our era on. About 300 such\r\ninscriptions have already been found, most of them in the southwest\r\nof Ireland, but some also in Scotland and Wales, and even in Devon\r\nand Cornwall. Wherever the Irish Gael planted a colony, he seems to\r\nhave brought his Ogam writing with him.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman who first invented the Ogam character was probably a\r\npagan who obtained a knowledge of Roman letters. He brought back to\r\nIreland his invention, or, as is most likely, invented it on Irish\r\nsoil. Indeed, the fact that no certain trace of Ogam writing has been\r\nfound upon the European continent indicates that the alphabet was\r\ninvented in Ireland itself. An inscription at Killeen Cormac, Co.\r\nKildare, survives which seems to show that the Roman alphabet was\r\nknown in Ireland in pagan times. Ogam is an alphabet suitable enough\r\nfor chiselling upon stones, but too cumbrous for the purposes of\r\nliterature. For this the Roman alphabet must have been used. The Ogam\r\nscript consists of a number of short lines straight or slanting, and\r\ndrawn either below, above, or through one long stem-line. This\r\nstem-line is generally the sharp angle between two faces or sides of\r\na long upright rectangular stone. Thus four cuts to the right of the\r\nlong line stand for S; to the left of it they mean C; passing through\r\nit, half on one side and half on the other, they mean Z. The device\r\nwas rude, but it was applied with considerable skill, and it was\r\nundoubtedly framed with much ingenuity. The vowels occurring most\r\noften are also the easiest to cut, being scarcely more than notches\r\non the edge of the stone. The inscription generally contains the name\r\nof the dead warrior over whom the memorial was raised; it usually\r\nbegins on the left corner of the stone facing the reader and is to be\r\nread upwards, and it is often continued down on the right hand\r\nangular line as well.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Ogam inscriptions is very ancient and nearly the\r\nsame forms occur as in what we know of Old Gaulish. The language, in\r\nfact, seems to have been an antique survival even when it was first\r\nengraved, in the third or fourth century. The word-forms are probably\r\nfar older than those used in the spoken language of the time. This is\r\na very important conclusion, and it must have a far-reaching bearing\r\nupon the history of the earliest epic literature. Because if forms of\r\nlanguage much more ancient than any that were then current were\r\nemployed on pillar-stones in the third or fourth century, it follows\r\nthat this obsolescent language must have survived either in a written\r\nor a regularly recited form. This immediately raises the probability\r\nthat the substance of Irish epic literature (which was written down\r\non parchment in the sixth or seventh century) really dates from a\r\nperiod much more remote, and that all that is purely pagan in it was\r\npreserved for us in the same antique language as the Ogam\r\ninscriptions before it was translated into what we now call \"Old\r\nIrish.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the Ogam alphabet as preserved on some 300 ancient\r\npillars and stones, in the probably ninth-century treatise in the\r\nBook of Ballymote, and elsewhere:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ogam Alphabet]\r\n\r\nThere are a great many allusions to this Ogam writing in the ancient\r\nepics, especially in those that are purely pagan in form and\r\nconception, and there can be no doubt that the knowledge of letters\r\nmust have reached Ireland before the island became Christianized.\r\nWith the introduction of Christianity and of Roman letters, the old\r\nOgam inscriptions, which were no doubt looked upon as flavoring of\r\npaganism, quickly fell into disuse and disappeared, but some\r\ninscriptions at least are as late as the year 600 or even 800. In the\r\nthoroughly pagan poem, _The Voyage of Bran_, which such authorities\r\nas Zimmer and Kuno Meyer both consider to have been committed to\r\nparchment in the seventh century, we find it stated that Bran wrote\r\nthe fifty or sixty quatrains of the poem in Ogam. Cuchulainn\r\nconstantly used Ogam writing, which he cut upon wands and trees and\r\nstanding stones for Queen Medb's army to read, and these were always\r\nbrought to his friend Fergus to decipher. Cormac, king of Cashel, in\r\nhis glossary tells us that the pagan Irish used to inscribe the wand\r\nthey kept for measuring corpses and graves with Ogam characters, and\r\nthat it was a source of horror to anyone even to take it in his hand.\r\nSt. Patrick in his Confession, the authenticity of which no one\r\ndoubts, describes how he dreamt that a man from Ireland came to him\r\nwith innumerable letters.\r\n\r\nIn Irish legend Ogma, one of the Tuatha De Danann who was skilled in\r\ndialects and poetry, seems to be credited with the invention of the\r\nOgam alphabet, and he probably was the equivalent of the Gaulish god\r\nOgmios, the god of eloquence, so interestingly described by Lucian.\r\n\r\nWe may take it then that the Irish pagans knew sufficient letters to\r\nhand down to Irish Christians the substance of their pagan epics,\r\nsagas, and poems. We may take it for granted also that the greater\r\nIrish epics (purely pagan in character, utterly untouched in\r\nsubstance by that Christianity which so early conquered the country)\r\nreally represent the thoughts, manners, feelings, and customs of\r\npagan Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this conclusion must be startling indeed to those who\r\nknow the ancient world only through the medium of Greek and Roman\r\nliterature. To the Greek and to his admiring master, the Roman, all\r\noutside races were simply barbarians, at once despised,\r\nmisinterpreted, and misunderstood.\r\n\r\nWe have no possible means of reconstructing the ancient world as it\r\nwas lived in by the ancestors of some of the leading races in Europe,\r\nthe Gauls, Spaniards, Britons, and the people of all those countries\r\nwhich trace themselves back to a Celtic ancestry, because these races\r\nhave left no literature or records behind them, and the Greeks and\r\nRomans, who tell us about them, saw everything through the false\r\nmedium of their own prejudices. But now since the discovery and\r\npublication of the Irish sagas and epics, the descendants of these\r\ngreat races no longer find it necessary to view their own past\r\nthrough the colored and distorting glasses of the Greek or the Roman,\r\nsince there has now opened for them, where they least expected to\r\nfind it, a window through which they can look steadily at the life of\r\ntheir race, or of one of its leading offshoots, in one of its\r\nstrongholds, and reconstruct for themselves with tolerable accuracy\r\nthe life of their own ancestors. It is impossible to overrate the\r\nimportance of this for the history of Europe, because neither Teutons\r\nnor Slavs have preserved pictures of their own heroic past, dating\r\nfrom pagan times. It is only the Celts, and of these the Irish, who\r\nhave handed down such pictures drawn with all the fond intimacy of\r\nromance, and descriptions which exhibit the life of western Europeans\r\nat an even earlier culture-stage in the evolution of humanity than do\r\nthe poems of Homer.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion, to which a study of the literature invites us, falls\r\nin exactly with that arrived at from purely archaeological sources.\r\nProfessor Ridgeway of Cambridge University, working on archaeological\r\nlines, expresses himself as follows: \"From this survey of the\r\nmaterial remains of the _la Tern_ period found actually in Ireland,\r\nand from the striking correspondence between this culture and that\r\ndepicted in the _Táin Bó Cúalnge_, and from the circumstance that the\r\nrace who are represented in the epic as possessing this form of\r\nculture resemble in their physique the tall, fair-haired, grey-eyed\r\nCelts of Britain and the continent, we are justified in inferring (1)\r\nthat there was an invasion (or invasions) of such peoples from Gaul\r\nin the centuries immediately before Christ, as is ascribed by the\r\nIrish traditions, and (2) that the poems themselves originally took\r\nshape when the _la Tène_ culture was still flourishing in Ireland.\r\nBut as this could hardly have continued much later than A.D. 100, we\r\nmay place the first shaping of the poems not much later than that\r\ndate and possibly a century earlier.\"\r\n\r\nThis conclusion would make the earliest putting together of the Irish\r\nepics almost contemporaneous with Augustus Cæsar.\r\n\r\nSo much for the history and growth of Irish letters.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nBrash: Ogam inscribed Monuments of the Gaedhil (1879); MacAlister:\r\nStudies in Irish Epigraphy, vol. 1 (1897), vol. 2 (1902), vol. 3\r\n(1907); Rhys: in Proceedings of the Scottish Society of Antiquaries\r\n(Edinburgh, 1892); Ridgeway: Date of the First Shaping of the\r\nCuchulain Saga (1905), in Proceedings of the British Academy, vol.\r\nII; Joyce: Social History of Ancient Ireland, vol.

Dottin, who is a\r\ndistinguished professor and dean at the University of Renacs, France.\r\nThe translation into English has been made by the Editors.]\r\n\r\nBy the year 1200 of the Christian era, a time at which the other\r\nnational literatures of Europe were scarcely beginning to develop,\r\nIreland possessed, and had possessed for several centuries, a Gaelic\r\npoetry, which was either the creation of the soul of the people or\r\nelse was the work of the courtly bards. This poetry was at first\r\nexpressed in rhythmical verses, each containing a fixed number of\r\naccented syllables and hemistichs separated by a pause:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Crist_ lim,    |  _Crist_ reum,   |  _Crist_ in degaid\r\n      _Crist_ indium  |  _Crist_ issum   |  _Crist_ úasum\r\n                      |  _Crist_ dessum  |  _Crist_ úasum\r\n\r\nThis versification, one of the elements of which was the repetition\r\nof words or sounds at regular intervals, was transformed about the\r\neighth century into a more learned system. Thenceforward\r\nalliteration, assonance, rhyme, and a fixed number of syllables\r\nconstituted the characteristics of Irish verse:\r\n\r\n      Mésse ocus Pángur bÁN\r\n      cechtar náthar fria sáindAN\r\n      bith a _ménma_ sam fri SEILGG\r\n      mu _ménma_ céin im sáinchEIRDD.\r\n\r\nAs we see, the consonants in the rhyme-words were merely related: _l,\r\nr, n, ng, m, dh, gh, bh, mh, ch, th, f_ could rime together just as\r\ncould _gg, dd, bb_. Soon the poets did not limit themselves to\r\nend-rhymes, which ran the risk of becoming monotonous, but introduced\r\nalso internal rhyme, which set up what we may call a continuous chain\r\nof melody:\r\n\r\n      is aire caraim DOIRE\r\n      ar a reidhe ar a ghlOINE\r\n      's ar iomad a aingel fIND\r\n      ó 'n CIND go aoich arOILE.\r\n\r\nThis harmonious versification was replaced in the seventeenth century\r\nby a system in which account was no longer taken of consonantal rhyme\r\nor of the number of syllables.\r\n\r\nThe rules of Irish verse have nothing in common with classical Latin\r\nmetres, which were based on the combination of short and long\r\nsyllables. In Low-Latin, indeed, we find occasionally alliteration,\r\nrhyme, and a fixed number of syllables, but these novelties are\r\nobviously of foreign origin, and date from the time when the Romans\r\nborrowed them from the nations which they called barbarous. We cannot\r\nprove beyond yea or nay that they are of Celtic origin, but it is\r\nextremely probable that they are, for it is among the Celts both of\r\nIreland and of Wales that the harmonizing of vowels and of consonants\r\nhas been carried to the highest degree of perfection.\r\n\r\nThis learned art was not acquired without long study. The training of\r\na poet (_filé_) lasted twelve years, or more. The poets had a regular\r\nhierarchy. The highest in rank, the _ollamh_, knew 350 kinds of verse\r\nand could recite 250 principal and 100 secondary stories. The\r\n_ollamhs_ lived at the court of the kings and the nobles, who granted\r\nthem freehold lands; their persons and their property were sacred;\r\nand they had established in Ireland schools in which the people might\r\nlearn history, poetry, and law. The bards formed a numerous class, of\r\na rank inferior to the _filé_; they did not enjoy the same honors and\r\nprivileges; some of them even were slaves; according to their\r\nstanding, different kinds of verse were assigned to them as a\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nThe Danish invasions in the ninth century set back for some time the\r\ndevelopment of Irish poetry, but, when the Irish had driven the\r\nfierce and aggressive sea-rovers from their country, there was a\r\nliterary renascence. This was in turn checked by the Anglo-Norman\r\ninvasion in the twelfth century, and thereafter the art of\r\nversification was no longer so refined as it had formerly been.\r\nNevertheless, the bardic schools still existed in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, more than four hundred years after the landing of Strongbow,\r\nand, in them, students followed the lectures of the _ollamhs_ for six\r\nmonths each year, or until the coming of spring, exercising both\r\ntheir talents for composition and their memory.\r\n\r\nA catalogue of Irish poets, which has recently been made out, shows\r\nthat there were more than a thousand of them. We have lost many of\r\nthe oldest poems, but the Irish scribes often modernized the texts\r\nwhich they were copying. Hence the language is not always a\r\nsufficient indication of date, and it is possible that, under a\r\ncomparatively modern form, some very ancient pieces may have been\r\npreserved. Even if the poems attributed to Amergin do not go back to\r\nthe tenth century B.C., as has been claimed for them, they are in any\r\ncase old enough to be archaic, and certain poems of the mythological\r\ncycle are undoubtedly anterior to the Christian era.\r\n\r\nWe have reason to believe that there have been preserved some genuine\r\npoems of Finn macCumaill (third century), a hymn by St. Patrick (d.\r\n461), some greatly altered verses of St. Columcille (d. 597), and\r\ncertain hymns written by saints who lived from the seventh to the\r\nninth century. The main object of the most celebrated of the ancient\r\npoets up to the end of the twelfth century was to render history,\r\ngenealogy, toponomy, and lives of saints readier of access and easier\r\nto retain by putting them into verse-form; and it is the names of\r\nthose scholars that have been rescued from oblivion, while lyric\r\npoetry, having as its basis nothing more than sentiment, has remained\r\nfor the most part anonymous. After the Anglo-Norman invasion, the\r\nbest poet seems to have been Donnchadh Mór O'Daly (d. 1244). Of later\r\ndate were Teig MacDaire (1570-1652), Teig Dall O'Higinn (d. 1615),\r\nand Eochaidh O'Hussey, who belonged to the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies. The new school, which abandoned the old rules and whose\r\ninspiration is now personal, now patriotic, is represented by\r\n_caoine_ (keens or laments), _abran_ (hymns), or _aislingi_\r\n(visions), composed, among others, by Geoffrey Keating (d. c. 1650),\r\nDavid O'Bruadair (c. 1625-1698), Egan O'Rahilly (c. 1670-c. 1734),\r\nJohn MacDonnell (1691-1754), William O'Heffernan (fl. 1750), John\r\nO'Tuomy (1706-1775), and Andrew MacGrath (d. c. 1790). The greatest\r\nof the eighteenth century Irish poets was Owen Roe O'Sullivan (c.\r\n1748-1784), whose songs were sung everywhere, and who, in the opinion\r\nof his editor, Father Dinneen, is the literary glory of his country\r\nand deserves to be ranked among the few supreme lyric poets of all\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIf, in order to study the subjects treated by the poets, we lay aside\r\ndidactic poetry and confine ourselves to the ancient poems from the\r\nseventh to the eleventh century, we shall find in the latter a\r\nsingular variety. They were at first dialogues or monologues, now\r\nfound incorporated with the sagas, of which they may have formed the\r\noriginal nucleus. Thus, in the _Voyage of Bran_, we have the account\r\nof the Isles of the Blessed and the discourse of the King of the Sea;\r\nin the _Expedition of Loégaire MacCrimthainn_, the brilliant\r\ndescription of the fairy hosts; in _The Death of the Sons of Usnech_,\r\nthe touching farewell of Deirdre to the land of Scotland and her\r\nlamentation over the dead bodies of the three warriors; and in the\r\n_Lay of Fothard Canann_, the strange and thrilling speech of the dead\r\nlover, returning after the battle to the tryst appointed by his\r\nsweetheart. Other poems seem never to have figured in a saga, like\r\nthe Song of Crede, daughter of Guaire, in which she extols the memory\r\nof her friend Dinertach, and the affecting love-scenes between Liadin\r\nand Curithir; or like the bardic songs designed to distribute praise\r\nor blame: the funeral panegyric on King Niall, in alternate verses,\r\nthe song of the sword of Carroll, and the satire of MacConglinne\r\nagainst the monks of Cork.\r\n\r\nReligious poetry comprised lyric fragments, which were introduced\r\ninto the lives of the saints and there formed a kind of Christian\r\nsaga, or else were based on Holy Writ, like the _Lamentation of Eve_;\r\nhymns in honor of the saints, like _The Hymn to St. Michael_, by Mael\r\nIsu; pieces such as the famous Hymn of St. Patrick; and philosophic\r\npoems like that keen analysis of the flight of thought which dates\r\nfrom the tenth century.\r\n\r\nAt a time when the poets of other lands seem wholly engrossed in the\r\nrecital of the deeds of men, one of the great and constant\r\ndistinguishing marks of poetry in Ireland, whether we have to do with\r\na short note set down by a scribe on the margin of a manuscript or\r\nwith a religious or profane poem, is a deep, personal, and intimate\r\nlove of nature expressed not by detailed description, but more often\r\nby a single picturesque and telling epithet. Thus we have the hermit\r\nwho prays God to give him a hut in a lonely place beside a clear\r\nspring in the wood, with a little lark to sing overhead; or we have\r\nMarban, who, rich in nuts, crab-apples, sloes, watercress, and honey,\r\nrefuses to go back to the court to which the king, his brother,\r\npresses him to return. Now, we have the description of the summer\r\nscene, in which the blackbird sings and the sun smiles; now, the song\r\nof the sea and of the wind, which blows tempestuously from the four\r\nquarters of the sky; again, the winter song, when the snow covers the\r\nhills, when every furrow is a streamlet and the wolves range\r\nrestlessly abroad, while the birds, numbed to the heart, are silent;\r\nor yet again the recluse in his cell, humorously comparing his quest\r\nof ideas to the pursuit of the mice by his pet cat. This deep love of\r\ninanimate and animate things becomes individualized in those poems in\r\nwhich every tree, every spring, every bird is described with its own\r\nspecial features.\r\n\r\nIf we remember that these original poems, which, before the twelfth\r\ncentury, expressed thoughts that were scarcely known to the\r\nliterature of Europe before the eighteenth, are, besides, clothed in\r\nthe rich garb of a subtle harmony, what admiration, what respect, and\r\nwhat love ought we not to show to that ancient Ireland which, in the\r\ndarkest ages of western civilization, not only became the depositary\r\nof Latin knowledge and spread it over the continent, but also had\r\nbeen able to create for herself new artistic and poetic forms!\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nHyde: Love Songs of Connacht (Dublin, 1893), Irish Poetry, an Essay\r\nin Irish with Translation in English and a Vocabulary (Dublin, 1902),\r\nThe Religious Songs of Connacht (London, 1906); Meyer: Ancient Gaelic\r\nPoetry (Glasgow, 1906), a Primer of Irish Metrics with a Glossary and\r\nan Appendix containing an Alphabetical List of the Poets of Ireland\r\n(Dublin, 1909); Dottin-Dunn: The Gaelic Literature of Ireland\r\n(Washington, 1906); Meyer: Selections from Ancient Irish Poetry (2d\r\nedition, London, 1913); Best: Bibliography of Irish Philology and of\r\nPrinted Irish Literature (Dublin, 1913); Loth: La métrique galloise\r\n(Paris, 1902); Thurneysen: Mittelirische Verslehren, Irische Texte\r\nIII.; Buile Suibhne (Dublin, 1910).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH HEROIC SAGAS\r\n\r\nBy ELEANOR HULL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIreland has the unique distinction of having preserved for mankind a\r\nfull and vivid literary record of a period otherwise, so far as\r\nnative memorials are concerned, clouded in obscurity. A few\r\nfragmentary suggestions, derived from ancient stone monuments or from\r\ndiggings in tumuli and graves, are all that Gaul or Britain have to\r\ncontribute to a knowledge of that important period just before and\r\njust after the beginning of our era, when the armies of Rome were\r\noverrunning western Europe and were brought, for the first time, into\r\ndirect contact with the Celtic peoples of the West. Almost all that\r\nwe know of the early inhabitants of these countries comes to us from\r\nthe pens of Roman writers and soldiers--Poseidonius, Caesar,\r\nDiodorus, Tacitus. We may give these observers credit for a desire to\r\nbe fair to peoples they sometimes admired and often dreaded, but\r\nconquerors are not always the best judges of the races they are\r\nengaged in subduing, especially when they are ignorant of their\r\nlanguage, unversed in their lore and customs, and unused to their\r\nways. Valuable as are the reports of Roman authorities, we feel at\r\nevery point the need of checking them by native records; but the\r\nnative records of Gaul, and in large part also those of Britain and\r\nWales, have been swept away. Caesar is probably right in saying that\r\nthe Druids, who were the learned men of their race and day, committed\r\nnothing to writing; if they did, whatever they wrote has been\r\nirrecoverably lost.\r\n\r\nBut Ireland was exempt from the sweeping changes brought about\r\nthrough long periods of Roman and Saxon occupation; no great upheaval\r\nfrom without disturbed the native political and social conditions up\r\nto the coming of the Norse and Danes about the beginning of the ninth\r\ncentury. Agricola, standing on the western coast of Britain, looked\r\nacross the dividing channel, and reflected upon \"the beneficial\r\nconnection that the conquest of Ireland would have formed between the\r\nmost powerful parts of the Roman Empire,\" but, fortunately for the\r\nliterature of Ireland, if not for her history, he never came. The\r\nearly incursions of the Scotti or Irish were eastward into England,\r\nWales, and Gaul, and there seem to have been few return movements\r\ntowards the west. Ireland pursued her path of native development\r\nundisturbed. It is to this circumstance that she owes the\r\npreservation of so much of her native literature, a great body of\r\nmaterial, historical, religious, poetic, romantic, showing marks of\r\nhaving originated at a very early time, and of great variety and\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAt what period this literature first began to be written down we do\r\nnot know. Orosius tells us that a traveler named Aethicus spent a\r\nconsiderable time in Ireland early in the fifth century \"examining\r\ntheir volumes\", which tends to prove that there was writing in\r\nIreland before St. Patrick. But the native bard must have made\r\nwriting superfluous. The man who could, at a moment's notice, recite\r\nany one out of the 350 stories which might be called for, besides\r\npoetry, genealogies, and tribal records, was worth many books. Only a\r\nfew were expert enough to read his writings, but all could enjoy his\r\ntales.\r\n\r\nThe earliest written records that we have now existing date from the\r\nseventh or eighth century; but undoubtedly there is preserved for us,\r\nin these materials, a picture of social conditions going back to the\r\nvery beginning of our era, and coeval with the stage of civilization\r\nknown in archaeology as _La Tène_ or \"Late Celtic\".\r\n\r\nTo help his memory the early \"shanachie\" or story-teller grouped his\r\nromantic story-store under different heads, such as \"Táins\" or\r\nCattle-spoils, Feasts, Elopements, Sieges, Battles, Destructions,\r\nTragical Deaths; but it is easier for us now to group them in another\r\nway, and to class together the series of tales referring to the\r\nTuatha De Danann or ancient deities, those belonging to the Red\r\nBranch cycle of King Conchobar and Cuchulainn, those relating to\r\nFinn, and the Legends of the Kings. The hundred or more tales\r\nbelonging to the second group are especially valuable for social\r\nhistory on account of the detailed descriptions they give of customs,\r\ndress, weapons, habits of life, and ethical ideas. To the historian,\r\nfolklorist, and student of primitive civilizations they are documents\r\nof the highest importance.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that the Red Branch cycle of tales, including the\r\nepic tale of the Táin or Cattle-spoil of Cualnge, which has gathered\r\nround itself a number of minor tales, had some basis of historical\r\nfact, and arose in the period of Ulster's predominance to celebrate\r\nthe deeds of a band of warlike champions who flourished in the north\r\nabout the beginning of the Christian era. No one who has visited the\r\nraths of Emain Macha, near Armagh, where stood the traditional site\r\nof the ancient capital of Ulster, or has followed the well-defined\r\nand massive outworks of Rath Celtchair and the forts of the other\r\nheroes whose deeds the tales embody, could doubt that they had their\r\norigin in great events that once happened there. The topography of\r\nthe tales is absolutely correct. Or again, when we cross over into\r\nConnacht, the remains at Rath Croghan, near the ancient palace of the\r\nAmazonian queen, Medb, testify to similar events. She it was who in\r\nher \"Pillow Talk\" with her husband Ailill declared that she had\r\nmarried him only because in him did she find the \"strange bride-gift\"\r\nwhich her imperious nature demanded, \"a man without stinginess,\r\nwithout jealousy, without fear.\" It was in her desire to surpass her\r\nhusband in wealth that she sent the combined armies of the south and\r\nwest into Ulster to carry off a famous bull, the Brown Bull of\r\nCooley, the only match in Ireland for one possessed by her spouse.\r\nThis raid forms the central subject of the _Táin Bó Cúalnge_. The\r\nmotif of the tale and the kind of life described in it alike show the\r\nprimitive conditions out of which it had its rise. It belongs to a\r\ntime when land was plenty for the scattered inhabitants to dwell\r\nupon, but stock to place upon it was scarce. The possession of herds\r\nwas necessary, not only for food and the provisioning of troops, but\r\nas a standard of wealth, a proof of position, and a means of\r\nexchange. Everything was estimated, before the use of money, by its\r\nvalue in kine or herds. When Medb and Ailill compare their\r\npossessions, to find out which of them is better than the other,\r\ntheir herds of cattle, swine, and horses are driven in, their\r\nornaments and jewels, their garments and vats and household\r\nappliances are displayed. The pursuit of the cattle of neighboring\r\ntribes was the prime cause of the innumerable raids which made every\r\nman's life one of perpetual warfare, much more so than the\r\nacquisition of land or the avenging of wrongs. Hence a motif that may\r\nseem to us insufficient and remote as the subject of a great epic\r\narose out of the necessities of actual life. Cattle-driving is the\r\noldest of all occupations in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe conditions we find described in these tales show us an open\r\ncountry, generally unenclosed by hedges or walls. The chariots can\r\ndrive straight across the province. There are no towns, and the\r\nstopping places are the large farmers' dwellings, open inns known as\r\n\"houses of hospitality\", fortified by surrounding raths or earthen\r\nwalls, the only private property in land, in a time when the\r\ntribe-land was common, that we hear of at this period. Within these\r\nborders lay the pleasure grounds and gardens and the cattle-sheds for\r\nthe herds, which the great landowner or chief loaned out to the\r\nsmaller men in return for services rendered. Here were trained in\r\narts of industry and fine needlework the daughters of the chief men\r\nof the tribe and their foster-sisters, drawn from the humbler\r\nfamilies around them. The rivers as a rule formed the boundaries of\r\nthe provinces, and the fords were constantly guarded by champions who\r\nchallenged every wayfarer to single combat, if he could not show\r\nsufficient reason for crossing the borderland. These combats were\r\nfought actually in the ford itself, and all wars began in a long\r\nseries of single hand-to-hand combats between equal champions before\r\nthe armies as a whole engaged each other.\r\n\r\nTo fight was every man's prime duty, and the man who had slain the\r\nlargest number of his fellows was acclaimed as the greatest hero. It\r\nwas the proud boast of Conall Cernach, \"the Victorious\", that seldom\r\nhad a day passed in which he had not challenged a Connachtman, and\r\nfew nights in which a Connachtman's head had not formed his pillow.\r\nIt shows the primitive savagery of the period that skulls of enemies\r\nwere worn dangling from the belt, and were stored up in one of the\r\npalaces of Emain Macha as trophies of valor. So warlike were the\r\nheroes that even during friendly feasts their weapons had to be hung\r\nup in a separate house, lest they should spring to arms in rivalry\r\nwith their own fellows.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of this rude barbarism of outward life, the warriors had\r\nformed for themselves a high and exacting code of honor, which may be\r\nregarded as the first steps toward what in later times and other\r\ncountries became known as \"chivalry\"; save that there is in the acts\r\nof the Irish heroes a simplicity and sincerity which puts them on a\r\nhigher level than the obligatory courtesies of more artificial ages.\r\nGenerosity between enemies was carried to an extraordinary pitch.\r\nTwice over in fights with different foes, Conall Cernach binds his\r\nright hand to his side in order that his enemy, who had lost one\r\nhand, may fight on equal terms with him. The two severest combats\r\nsustained by Cuchulainn, the youthful Ulster champion, in the long\r\nwar of the Táin are those with Loch the Great and Ferdiad, both\r\nfirst-rate warriors, who had been forced by the wiles of Medb into\r\nunwilling conflict against their young antagonist. In their youth\r\nthey had been fellow-pupils in the school of the Amazon Scathach, who\r\nhad taught them both alike the arts of war. When Loch the Great, as a\r\ndying request, prays Cuchulainn to permit him to rise, \"so that he\r\nmay fall on his face and not backwards towards the men of Erin,\" lest\r\nhereafter it should be said that he fell in flight, Cuchulainn\r\nreplies: \"That will I surely, for it is a warrior's boon thou\r\ncravest,\" and he steps back to allow the wounded man to reverse his\r\nposition in the ford. The tale of Cuchulainn's combat with Ferdiad\r\nhas become classic; nothing more pathetic or more full of the true\r\nspirit of chivalry is to be found in any literature. Each warrior\r\nestimates nobly the prowess of the other, each sorrowfully recalls\r\nthe memory of old friendships and expeditions made together. When\r\nFerdiad falls, his ancient comrade pours out over him a passionate\r\nlament. Each night, when the day's combat is over, they throw their\r\narms round each other's neck and embrace. Their horses are put up in\r\nthe same paddock and their charioteers sleep beside the same fire;\r\neach night Cuchulainn sends to his wounded friend a share of the\r\nherbs that are applied to his own wounds, while to Cuchulainn Ferdiad\r\nsends a fair half of the pleasant delicate food supplied to him by\r\nthe men of Erin. We may recall, too, Cuchulainn's act of compassion\r\ntowards Queen Medb near the close of the Táin. Her army is flying in\r\nrout homeward across the Shannon, closely pursued by Cuchulainn. As\r\nhe approaches the ford he finds Queen Medb lying prostrate on the\r\nbank, unable any longer to guard the retreat of her army. She appeals\r\nto her enemy to aid her; and Cuchulainn, with that lovable boyish\r\ndelight in acts of supreme generosity which is always ascribed to\r\nhim, undertakes to shield the retreat of the disordered host from his\r\nown troops and to see them safely across the river, while Medb\r\nreposes peacefully in a field hard by. The spirit which actuates the\r\nheroes is well expressed by Cuchulainn when his friends would\r\nrestrain him from going forth to his last fight, knowing that in that\r\nbattle he must fall: \"I had rather than the whole world's gold and\r\nthan the earth's riches that death had ere now befallen me, so would\r\nnot this shame and testimony of reproach now stand recorded against\r\nme; for in every tongue this noble old saying is remembered, 'Fame\r\noutlives life.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Irish tales surpass those of the Arthurian cycle in simplicity,\r\nin humor, and in human interest; the characters are not mere types of\r\nfixed virtues and vices, they have each a strongly marked\r\nindividuality, consistently adhered to through the multitude of\r\ndifferent stories in which they play a part. This is especially the\r\ncase with regard to the female characters. Emer, Deirdre, Etain,\r\nGrainne may be said to have introduced into European literature new\r\ntypes of womanhood, quite unlike, in their sprightliness and humor,\r\ntheir passionate affection and heroic qualities, to anything found\r\nelsewhere. Stories about women play a large part in ancient Irish\r\nliterature; their elopements, their marriages, their griefs and\r\ntragedies, form the subject of a large number of tales. Among the\r\nlist of tales that any bard might be called upon to recite, the\r\n\"Courtships\" or \"Wooings\" probably formed a favorite group; they are\r\nof great variety and beauty. The Irish, indeed, may be called the\r\ninventors of the love-tale for modern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe gravest defect of this literature (a defect which is common to\r\nall early literature before coming under the chastening hand of the\r\nmaster) is undoubtedly its tendency to extravagance; though much\r\ndepended upon the individual writer, some being stylists and some\r\nnot, all were prone to frequent and grotesque exaggerations. The lack\r\nof restraint and self-criticism is everywhere apparent; the old Irish\r\nwriter seems incapable of judging how to shape his material with a\r\nview to presenting it in its best form. Thus, we have the feeling,\r\neven with regard to the _Táin Bó Cúalnge_, that what has come down to\r\nus is rather the rough-shaped material of an epic than a completed\r\ndesign. The single stories and the groups of stories have been\r\nhandled and rehandled at different times, but only occasionally, as\r\nin the Story of Deirdre (the \"Sorrowful Tale of the Sons of Usnech\"),\r\nor in the later versions of the \"Wooing of Emer\", or the Book of\r\nLeinster version of the \"Wooing of Ferb\", do we feel that a competent\r\nartist has so formed his story that the best possible value has been\r\nextracted from it. Yet, in spite of their defects, the old heroic\r\nsagas of Ireland have in them a stimulating force and energy, and an\r\nelement of fine and healthy optimism, which is strangely at variance\r\nwith the popular conception of the melancholy of Irish literature,\r\nand which, wherever they are known, make them the fountain-head of a\r\nfresh creative inspiration. This stimulating of the imagination is\r\nperhaps the best gift that a revived interest in the old native\r\nromance of Ireland has to bestow.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nThe originals of many of the Tales of the Cuchulainn cycle of\r\nromances will be found, usually accompanied by English or German\r\ntranslations, in the volumes of _Irische Texte; Revue Celtique;\r\nZeitschrift für Celt.

Dante himself was a native of Florence, Italy,\r\nand lived from 1265 to 1321. Like many great men, he incurred the\r\nhatred of his countrymen, and he spent, as a result, the last twenty\r\nyears of his life in exile with a price on his head. He had been\r\nfalsely accused of theft and treachery, and his indignation at the\r\nwrong thus done him and at the evil conduct of his contemporaries led\r\nhim to write his poem, in which he visits Hell, Purgatory, and\r\nParadise, and learns how God punishes bad actions, and how He rewards\r\nthose who do His will.\r\n\r\nTo the writing of his poem Dante brought all the learning of his\r\ntime, all its science, and an art that has never been surpassed,\r\nperhaps never equalled. Of course, he did not know any Irish, but he\r\nknew Italian and the then universal tongue of the learned--Latin, in\r\nboth of which were tales of visits to the other world; and the\r\ngreater part of these tales, as well as those most resembling Dante's\r\nwork in form and spirit, were Irish in origin.\r\n\r\nAll peoples have traditions of persons visiting the realms of the\r\ndead. Homer tells of Odysseus going there; Virgil does the same of\r\nAeneas; and the Oriental peoples, as well as the Germanic races, have\r\nsimilar tales; but no people have so many or such finished accounts\r\nof this sort as the ancient Irish. In pagan times in Ireland one of\r\nthe commonest adventures attributed to a hero was a visit to \"tír na\r\nm-beó,\" the land of the living, or to \"tír na n-óg,\" the land of the\r\nyoung; and this supernatural world was reached in some cases by\r\nentering a fairy mound and going beneath the ground to it, and in\r\nothers by sailing over the ocean.\r\n\r\nOf the literature of pagan Ireland, though much has come down to us,\r\nwe have only a very small fraction of what once existed, and what we\r\nhave has been transmitted and modified by persons of later times and\r\ndifferent culture, who, both consciously and unconsciously, have\r\nchanged it, so that it is very different from what it was in its\r\noriginal form; but the subject and the main outlines still remain,\r\nand we have many accounts of both voyages and underground journeys to\r\nthe other world.\r\n\r\nThe oldest voyage is, perhaps, that of Maelduin, which, Tennyson has\r\ntransmuted into English under the title _The Voyage of Maeldune_.\r\nThis is a voyage undertaken for revenge; but vengeance, as Sir Walter\r\nScott has pointed out in his preface to _The Two Drovers_, springs in\r\na barbarous society from a passion for justice; and it is this\r\ninstinct for justice that inspires the Irish hero to endure and to\r\nachieve what he does. Christianity has preserved this legend and\r\nadded to it its own peculiar quality of mercy; and this illustrates\r\none of the characteristics of Ireland's pagan literature--it is\r\nimperfectly Christian and can readily be made to express the\r\nChristian point of view.\r\n\r\nAnother voyage of pagan Irish literature is the _Voyage of Bran_. In\r\nthis tale idealism is the inspiration that leads the hero into the\r\nunknown world. A woman appears who is invisible to all but Bran, and\r\nwhose song of the beauteous supernatural land beyond the wave is\r\nheard by none but him; so that, after refusing to go with her the\r\nfirst time she appears, at length he steps into her boat of glass and\r\nsails away to view the wonders and taste the joys of the other world.\r\n\r\nIn these tales we have two main elements, one real and one ideal. The\r\nreal element is the fact that the ancient Irish unquestionably made\r\nvoyages and visited lands which the fervid Celtic imagination and the\r\nlapse of time transformed into the wonderful regions of the legends.\r\nThe stories are thus early geographies, and they show unmistakably a\r\nknowledge of western Europe and of the Canary Islands or some other\r\ntropical regions; perhaps also, some have gone so far as to claim,\r\nthey are reminiscent of voyages to America.\r\n\r\nThe ideal element is no less important as indicating achievement, for\r\nit shows that the Irish poets of pagan times had not only realized,\r\nbut had succeeded in making their national traditions embody, the\r\nfact that love of justice and aspiration for knowledge are the\r\nfoundations of all enduring human achievement and all perfect human\r\njoy. Christianity therefore found moral and spiritual ideas of a\r\nhighly developed order in pagan Ireland, and it did not hesitate to\r\nadopt whatever in the literature of the country illustrated its own\r\nteachings, and not only were these stories of visits to the other\r\nworld full of suggestions as to ways of enforcing Christian doctrine,\r\nbut the Irish church and men of Irish birth were the most active in\r\nspreading the faith in the early centuries of its conquest of western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it is not strange that all the earliest Christian\r\nvisions of the spirit-world were of Irish origin. We find the\r\nearliest in the _Ecclesiastical History_ of the \"Venerable Bede,\" who\r\ndied in 735. It is the story of how an Irishman of great sanctity,\r\nFurseus by name, was taken in spirit by three angels to a place from\r\nwhich he looked down and saw the four fires that are to consume the\r\nworld: those of falsehood, avarice, discord, fraud and impiety. In\r\nthis there is the germ of some very fundamental things in Dante's\r\npoem, and we know that Dante knew Bede and had probably read his\r\nhistory, for he places him in Paradise and mentions him elsewhere in\r\nhis works.\r\n\r\nIn Bede's work there is also another vision, and though in this\r\nsecond case the man who visits the spirit-world is not an Irishman,\r\nbut a Saxon named Drithelm, yet the story came to Bede through an\r\nIrish monk named Haemgils; so it, too, is connected with Ireland, and\r\nit also contains much that is developed further in the _Divine\r\nComedy_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated of the works belonging to this class of\r\nso-called \"visionary\" writings is the _Fis_ or \"Vision\" which goes\r\nunder the name of the famous Irish saint, Adamnan, who was poetically\r\nentitled the \"High Scholar of the Western World.\" This particular\r\nvision, the _Fis Adamnáin_, is remarkable among other things for its\r\nliterary quality, which is far superior to anything of the time, and\r\nfor the fact that it represents \"the highest level of the school to\r\nwhich it belonged,\" and that it is \"the most important contribution\r\nmade to the growth of the legend within the Christian Church prior to\r\nthe advent of Dante.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Irish vision of great popularity all over Europe in the\r\nMiddle Ages is the _Voyage of Saint Brendan_. This is known as the\r\nIrish Odyssey, and it is similar to the pagan tales of Maelduin and\r\nBran, except that instead of its hero being a dauntless warrior\r\nseeking vengeance or a noble youth seeking happiness, he is a\r\nChristian saint in quest of peace; and instead of the perils of the\r\nway being overcome by physical force or the favor of some capricious\r\npagan deity, they are averted by the power of faith and virtue.\r\n\r\nThe _Voyage of Saint Brendan_, like its pagan predecessors, has a\r\nreal and an ideal basis; and in both respects it shows an advancement\r\nover its prototypes. It contains some very poetic touches, and is\r\ncredited with being the source of some of the most effective features\r\nof Dante's poem. Its great popularity is shown by the fact that\r\nCaxton, the first English printer, published a translation of it in\r\n1483; so that it was among the first books printed in English, and\r\nfor that reason must have been one of the best-known works of the\r\ntime. Dante undoubtedly knew it, for he was a great scholar in the\r\nlearning of his day, and especially in ecclesiastical history and the\r\nbiography of saints.\r\n\r\nAnother vision of Irish origin that Dante and other writers have\r\nborrowed from is that of an Irish soldier named Tundale. He is said\r\nto have been a very wicked and proud man, who refused to a friend who\r\nowed him for three horses an extension of time in which to pay for\r\nthem. For this he was struck down by an invisible hand so that he\r\nremained apparently dead from Wednesday till Saturday, when he\r\nrevived and told a story of a visit to the world of the dead that has\r\nmany features later embodied in the _Divine Comedy_. Tundale's vision\r\nis said to have taken place in 1149; Dante probably wrote his poem\r\nbetween 1314 and 1321.\r\n\r\nThe Irish also produced another legend of this sort that was\r\nenormously and universally popular, and became the chief authority on\r\nthe nature of heaven and hell, in the story of _Saint Patrick's\r\nPurgatory_. Saint Patrick was said to have been granted a view of\r\nheaven and hell, and a certain island in Lough Derg in Donegal was\r\nreputed to be the spot in which he had begun his journey; and there,\r\nit was said, those who desired to purge themselves of their sins\r\ncould enter as he had entered and come back to the world again,\r\nprovided their faith was strong enough.\r\n\r\nThis legend was probably known in Ireland from a very early time, but\r\nit had spread over all western Europe by the twelfth century. Henry\r\nof Saltrey, a Benedictine monk of the Abbey of that name in England,\r\nwrote an account in Latin of the descent of an Irish soldier named\r\nOwen into Saint Patrick's Purgatory in 1153; and this story soon\r\nbecame the subject of poetic treatment all over Europe. We have\r\nseveral French versions, one by the celebrated French poetess Marie\r\nde France, who lived about 1200; and there are others in all the\r\nlanguages of Europe, besides evidence of its wide circulation in the\r\noriginal Latin. Its importance is shown by the fact that it is\r\nmentioned by Matthew Paris, the chief English historian of the\r\nthirteenth century, and also by Froissart, the well-known French\r\nannalist of the fourteenth while Calderon, the great Spanish\r\ndramatist, has written a play based on the legend. Dante undoubtedly\r\nknew of Marie de France's version as well as the original of Henry of\r\nSaltrey and probably others besides.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be seen that Dante's masterpiece is\r\nlargely based on literature of Irish origin; but there are other\r\nsuperlative exhibitions of human genius of which the same is true.\r\nOne of these is the story of Tristan and Isolde. Tristan is the\r\nparagon of all knightly accomplishments, the most versatile figure in\r\nthe entire literature of chivalry; while Isolde is an Irish princess.\r\nBy a trick of fate these two drink a love potion inadvertently and\r\nbecome irresistibly enamored of each other, although Isolde is\r\nbetrothed to King Mark of Cornwall, and Tristan is his nephew and\r\nambassador. The story that follows is infinitely varied, intensely\r\ndramatic, delicately beautiful, and tenderly pathetic. It has been\r\ntreated by several poets of great genius, among them Gottfried of\r\nStrassburg, the greatest German poet of his time, and Richard Wagner;\r\nbut all the beauty and power in the works of these men existed in the\r\noriginal Celtic form of the tale, and the later writers have only\r\ndiscovered it and brought it to light.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true of the Arthurian Legend and the story of the\r\nHoly Grail. Dante knew of King Arthur's fame, and mentions him in the\r\n_Inferno_. To Dante he was a Christian hero, and the historical\r\nArthur may have been a Christian; but much in the story goes back to\r\nthe pagan Celtic religion. We can find in Irish literature many\r\nreferences that indicate a belief in a self-sustaining, miraculous\r\nobject similar to the Holy Grail, and the fact that this object was\r\ndeveloped into a symbol of some of the deepest and most beautiful\r\nChristian truths shows the high character of the civilization and\r\nliterature of ancient Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nWright: St. Patrick's Purgatory (London, 1844); Krapp: The Legend of\r\nSt. Patrick's Purgatory (Baltimore, 1900); Becker: Mediaeval Visions\r\nof Heaven and Hell (Baltimore, 1899); Shackford: Legends and Satires\r\n(Boston, 1913); Meyer and Nutt: The Voyage of Bran, edited and\r\ntranslated by K.

QUIGGIN, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the literary peoples of the west of Europe, the Irish, in late\r\nmedieval and early modern times, were singularly little affected by\r\nthe frequent innovations in taste and theme which influenced Romance\r\nand Teutonic nations alike. To such an extent is this true, that one\r\nis often inclined to think that far-off Iceland was to a greater\r\ndegree in the general European current than the much more accessible\r\nErin. During the age of chivalry, conditions in Ireland were not\r\ncalculated to promote the growth of epic and lyric poetry after the\r\ncontinental manner. Some considerable time elapsed before the Norman\r\nbarons became fully Hibernicised, previous to which their interest\r\nmay be assumed to have turned to the compositions of the trouvères.\r\nIn the early Norman period, the poets of Ireland might well have\r\nbegun to imitate Romance models. But, strange to say, they did not,\r\nand, for this, various reasons might be assigned. The flowing verses\r\nof the Anglo-Norman were impossible for men who delighted in the\r\ntrammels of the native prosody; and in the heyday of French\r\ninfluence, the patrons of letters in Ireland probably insisted on\r\nhearing the foreign compositions in their original dress, as these\r\nnobles were doubtless sufficiently versed in Norman-French to be able\r\nto appreciate them. But a still more potent factor was the\r\nconservatism of the hereditary Irish poet families. A close\r\ncorporation, they appear to have resented every innovation, and were\r\ncontent to continue the tradition of their ancestors. The direct\r\nconsequence of this tenacious clinging to the fashions of by-gone\r\ndays rendered it impossible, nay almost inconceivable, that the\r\nliterary men of Ireland should have exerted any profound or immediate\r\ninfluence upon England or western Europe. Yet, nowadays, few serious\r\nscholars will be prepared to deny that the island contributed in\r\nconsiderable measure to the common literary stock of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nWe might expect to find that direct influence, as a general rule, can\r\nbe most easily traced in the case of religious themes. Here, in the\r\nliterature of vision, so popular in Ireland, a chord was struck which\r\ncontinued to vibrate powerfully until the time of the Reformation. In\r\nthis branch the riotous fancy of the Celtic monk caught the medieval\r\nimagination from an early period. Bede has preserved for us the story\r\nof Fursey, an Irish hermit who died in France, A.D. 650. The greatest\r\nIrish composition of this class with which we are acquainted, the\r\n_Vision of Adamnan_, does not appear to have been known outside the\r\nisland, but a later work of a similar nature met with striking\r\nsuccess. This was the _Vision of Tundale_ (Tnudgal), written in Latin\r\nby an Irishman named Marcus at Regensburg, about the middle of the\r\ntwelfth century. It seems probable that this work was known to Dante,\r\nand, in addition to the numerous continental versions, there is a\r\nrendering of the story into Middle English verse.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the Visions are the _Imrama_ or \"voyages\" (Lat.\r\n_navigationes_). The earliest romances of this class are secular,\r\n_e.g., Imram Maelduin_, which provided Tennyson with the frame-work\r\nof his well-known poem. However, the notorious love of adventure on\r\nthe part of the Irish monks inevitably led to the composition of\r\nreligious romances of a similar kind. The most famous story of this\r\ndescription, the_ Voyage of St. Brendan_, found its way into every\r\nChristian country in Europe, and consequently figures in the South\r\nEnglish Legendary, a collection of versified lives of saints made in\r\nthe neighborhood of Gloucester towards the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The episode of St. Brendan and the whale, moreover, was\r\nprobably the ultimate source of one of Milton's best known similes in\r\nhis description of Satan. Equally popular was the visit of Sir Owayn\r\nto the Purgatory of St. Patrick, which is also included in the same\r\nMiddle English Legendary. Ireland further contributed in some measure\r\nto the common stock of medieval stories which were used as\r\nillustrations by the preachers and in works of an edifying character.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to purely secular themes, we find ourselves on much less\r\ncertain ground. Though the discussion as to the origins of the\r\n\"romance of Uther's son\", Arthur, continues with unabated vigor, many\r\nscholars have come think that the Celtic background of these stories\r\ncontains much that is derived from Hibernian sources. Some writers in\r\nthe past have argued in favor of an independent survival of common\r\nCeltic features, in Wales and Ireland, but now the tendency is to\r\nregard all such coincidences as borrowings on the part of Cymric\r\ncraftsmen. At the beginning of the twelfth century a new impulse\r\nseems to have been imparted to native minstrelsy in Wales under'the\r\npatronage of Gruffydd ap Cynan, a prince of Gwynedd, who had spent\r\nmany years in exile at the court of Dublin. Some of the Welsh\r\nrhapsodists apparently served a kind of apprenticeship with their\r\nIrish brethren, and many things Irish were assimilated at this time\r\nwhich, through this channel, were shortly to find their way into\r\nAnglo-French. Thus it may now be regarded as certain that the name of\r\nthe \"fair sword\" Excalibur, by Geoffrey called Caliburnus (Welsh\r\n_caletfwlch_), is taken from Caladbolg, the far-famed broadsword of\r\nFergus macRoig. It does not appear that the whole framework of the\r\nIrish sagas was taken over, but, as Windisch points out, episodes\r\nwere borrowed as well as tricks of imagery. So, to mention but one,\r\nthe central incident of _Syr Gawayn and the Grene Knyght_ is\r\ndoubtless taken from the similar adventure of Cuchulainn in\r\n_Bricriu's Feast_. The share assigned to Irish influence in the\r\n_matière de Bretagne_ is likely to grow considerably with the\r\nprogress of research.\r\n\r\nThe fairy lore of Great Britain undoubtedly owes much to Celtic\r\nphantasy. Of this Chaucer, at any rate, had little doubt, as he\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n      In th' olde dayes of the King Arthour,\r\n      Of which that Britons speken greet honour,\r\n      Al was this land fulfild of fayerye;\r\n      The elf-queen, with hir joly companye,\r\n      Daunced ful ofte in many a grene med.\r\n\r\nAnd here again there is a reasonable probability that certain\r\nfeatures were borrowed from the wealth of story current in the\r\nneighboring isle. Otherwise it is difficult to understand why the\r\nqueen of fayerye should bear an Irish name (Mab, from Irish Medb),\r\nand curiously enough the form of the name rathef suggests that it was\r\nborrowed through a written medium and not by oral tradition. On the\r\nother hand it is incorrect to derive Puck from Irish _puca_, as the\r\nlatter is undoubtedly borrowed from some form of Teutonic speech.\r\n\r\nSo all embracing a mind as that of the greatest English dramatist\r\ncould not fail to be interested in the gossip that must have been\r\ncurrent in London at the time of the wars in Ulster. References to\r\nkerns and gallowglasses are fairly frequent. He had evidently heard\r\nof the marvellous powers with which the Irish bards were credited,\r\nfor, in _As You Like It_, Rosalind exclaims:\r\n\r\n\"I was never so be-rhymed since Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish\r\nrat, which I can hardly remember.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in _King Richard III_, mention is made of the prophetic\r\nutterance of an Irish bard, a trait which does not appear in the\r\npoet's source. Any statements as to Irish influence in Shakespeare\r\nthat go beyond this belong to the realm of conjecture. Professor\r\nKittredge has attempted to show that in Syr Orfeo, upon which the\r\npoet drew for portions of the plot of _A Midsummer Night's Dream_,\r\nthe Irish story of Etain and Mider was fused with the medieval form\r\nof the classical tale of Orpheus and Eurydice. Direct influence is\r\nentirely wanting, and it is difficult to see how it could have been\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nEven in the case of the Elizabethan poet who spent many years in the\r\nsouth of Ireland, there is no trace of Hibernian lore or legend.\r\nSpenser, indeed, tells us himself that he had caused some of the\r\nnative poetry to be translated to him, and had found that it\r\n\"savoured of sweet wit and good invention.\" But Ireland plays an\r\ninfinitesimal part in the _Faerie Queene_. The scenery round\r\nKilcolman Castle forms the background of much of the incident in Book\r\nV. \"Marble far from Ireland brought\" is mentioned in a simile in the\r\nsecond Book, where we also read:\r\n\r\n      As when a swarme of gnats at eventide\r\n      Out of the fennes of Allan do arise.\r\n\r\nBut Ireland supplied no further inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe various plantations of the seventeenth century produced an\r\nAnglo-Irish stock which soon asserted itself in literature. As a\r\ntypical example, we may take the author of _The Vicar of Wakefield_.\r\nAt his first school at Lissoy, Oliver Goldsmith came under Thomas\r\nByrne, a regular shanachie, possessed of all the traditional lore,\r\nwith a remarkable gift for versifying. It was under this man that the\r\nboy made his first attempts at verse, and his memory is celebrated in\r\n_The Deserted Village_:\r\n\r\n      There, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule,\r\n      The village master taught his little school.\r\n      A man severe he was, and stern to view.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Goldsmith was removed to Elphin at the age of nine, and\r\nalthough he retained an affection for Irish music all his life, his\r\nintimate connection with Irish Ireland apparently ceased at this\r\npoint. \"Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain\" is doubtless\r\nfull of reminiscences of the poet's early years in Westmeath, but the\r\nsentiments, the rhythm, and the language are entirely cast in an\r\nEnglish mould. We may mention, in passing, that it has been suggested\r\nthat Swift derived the idea of the kingdom of Lilliput from the Irish\r\nstory of the Adventures of Fergus macLeide amongst the leprechauns.\r\nAll that can be said is that this derivation is not impossible,\r\nthough the fact that the tale is preserved only in a single\r\nmanuscript rather points to the conclusion that the story did not\r\nenjoy great popularity in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Goldsmith was removed from an Irish atmosphere at a\r\ntender age, and this is not the only instance of the frowning of\r\nfortune upon the native literature. When the fame of the ancient\r\nbards of the Gael was noised from end to end of Europe, it was\r\nthrough the medium of Macpherson's forgeries. _Fingal_ caught the\r\nfleeting fancy of the moment in a manner never achieved by the true\r\nOssianic lays of Ireland. The _Reliques of Irish Poetry_, published\r\nby Miss Brooke by subscription in Dublin in 1789 to vindicate the\r\nantiquity of the literature of Erin, never went into a second\r\nedition. And although some of the pieces contained in that volume\r\nhave been reprinted in such undertakings of a learned character as\r\nthe volumes of the Dublin Ossianic Society, J.F. Campbell's _Leabhar\r\nna Feinne_, and Cameron's _Reliquiae Celticae_, they have aroused\r\nlittle interest amongst those ignorant of the Irish tongue.\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century, the number of poets who drew upon\r\nIreland's past for their themes increased considerably. The most\r\npopular of all is unquestionably the author of the _Irish Melodies_.\r\nBut, here again, the poet owes little or nothing to vernacular\r\npoetry, the mould is English, the sentiments are those of the poet's\r\nage. Moore's acquaintance with the native language can have been but\r\nof the slightest, and in the case of Mangan we are told that he had\r\nto rely upon literal versions of Irish pieces furnished him by\r\nO'Donovan or O'Curry. Of the numerous attempts to reproduce the\r\noverelaboration of rhyme to which Irish verse has ever been prone,\r\nFather Prout's _Bells of Shandon_ is perhaps the only one that is at\r\nall widely known. When the legendary lore of Ireland became\r\naccessible to men of letters, owing to the labors of O'Curry,\r\nO'Donovan, and Hennessy, and the publication of various ancient texts\r\nby the Irish Archaeological Society, it was to be expected that an\r\nattempt would be made by some poet of Erin to do for his native land\r\nwhat the Wizard of the North had accomplished for Scotland. The task\r\nwas undertaken by Sir Samuel Ferguson, who met with conspicuous\r\nsuccess. His most ambitious effort, _Congal_, deals in epic fashion\r\nwith the story of the battle of Moyra. Others in similar strain treat\r\nthe story of Conaire Mór and Deirdre, whilst others such as the\r\n_Tain-Quest_ are more in the nature of ballads. Ferguson did more to\r\nintroduce the English reading public to Irish story than would have\r\nbeen accomplished by any number of bald translations. His diction is\r\nlittle affected by the originals, and he sometimes treats his\r\nmaterials with great freedom, but his achievement was a notable one,\r\nand he has not infrequently been acclaimed as the national poet.\r\n\r\nIs it perhaps invidious to single out any living author for special\r\nmention, but this brief survey cannot close without noticing the\r\ndramatic poems of W.B. Yeats, the latest poet who attempts to present\r\nthe old stories in an English dress. His plays _On Baile's Strand,\r\nDeirdre_, and others, have become familiar to English audiences\r\nthrough the excellent acting of the members of the Abbey Theatre\r\nCompany. The original texts are now much better known than they were\r\nin Ferguson's day, and Mr. Yeats consequently cannot permit himself\r\nthe same liberties. Similarly, it is only during the last twenty-five\r\nyears that the language of Irish poetry has been carefully studied,\r\nand Mr. Yeats has this advantage over his predecessors that on\r\noccasion, e.g., in certain passages in _The King's Threshold_, he is\r\nable to introduce with great effect reminiscences of the\r\ncharacteristic epithets and imagery which formed so large a part of\r\nthe stock-in-trade of the medieval bard.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nFriedel and Meyer: La Vision de Tondale (Paris, 1907); Boswell: An\r\nIrish Precursor of Dante (London, 1908); Cambridge History of English\r\nLiterature, vol.

For\r\nthe key to the religion of savages is fear, and until such terror has\r\nbeen counteracted by belief in beneficent powers, civilization will\r\nnot follow. But the elimination of the fear of the unseen is a slow\r\nprocess; indeed, it will exist side by side with the belief in\r\nChristianity itself, after a modification through various stages of\r\nbetter pagan belief.\r\n\r\nIreland still presents, in its more out-of-the-way districts,\r\nevidence of that strong persistence in the belief in maleficent or\r\nmalicious influences of the pre-Christian powers of the air, which it\r\nseems difficult to eradicate from the Celtic imagination. In the\r\ncelebrated poem entitled _The Breastplate of St. Patrick_, there is\r\nmuch the same attitude on the part of Patrick towards the Druids and\r\ntheir powers of concealing and changing, of paralyzing and cursing,\r\nas was shown by Moses towards the magicians of Egypt. Indeed, in\r\nPatrick's time a belief in a world of fairies existed even in the\r\nking's household, for \"when the two daughters of King Leary of\r\nIreland, Ethnea the fair and Fedelma the ruddy, came early one\r\nmorning to the well of Clebach to wash, they found there a synod of\r\nholy bishops with Patrick. And they knew not whence they came, or in\r\nwhat form, or from what people, or from what country; but they\r\nsupposed them to be _Duine Sidh_, or gods of the earth, or a\r\nphantasm.\"\r\n\r\nColgan explains the term _Duine Sidh_ thus: \"Fantastical spirits,\" he\r\nwrites, \"are by the Irish called men of the _Sidh_, because they are\r\nseen, as it were, to come out of the beautiful hills to infest men,\r\nand hence the vulgar belief that they reside in certain subterranean\r\nhabitations: and sometimes the hills themselves are called, by the\r\nIrish, _Sidhe_ or _Siodha_.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt, when the princesses spoke of the gods of the earth,\r\nreference was made to such pagan deities as Beal; Dagda the great or\r\nthe good god; Aine, the Moon, goddess of the water and of wisdom;\r\nManannan macLir, the Irish Neptune; Crom, the Irish Ceres; and\r\nIphinn, the benevolent, whose relations to the Irish Oirfidh\r\nresembled those of Apollo towards Orpheus; and to the allegiance they\r\nowed to the Elements, the Wind, and the Stars. But besides these\r\npagan divinities and powers, and quite apart from them, the early\r\nIrish believed in two classes of fairies: in the first place, a\r\nhierarchy of fairy beings, well and ill disposed, not differing in\r\nappearance, to any great degree at any rate, from human beings--good\r\nspirits and demons, rarely visible during the daytime; and, in the\r\nsecond place, there was the magic race of the De Danann, who, after\r\nconquest by the Milesians, transformed themselves into fairies, and\r\nin that guise continued to inhabit the underworld of the Irish hills,\r\nand to issue thence in support of Irish heroes, or to give their aid\r\nagainst other fairy adversaries.\r\n\r\nThere is another theory to account for the fairy race. It is that\r\nthey are angels who revolted with Satan and were excluded from heaven\r\nfor their unworthiness, but were not found evil enough for hell, and\r\ntherefore were allowed to occupy that intermediate space which has\r\nbeen called \"the Other World.\" It is still a moot point with the\r\nIrish peasantry, as it was with the Irish saints of old, whether,\r\nafter being compelled to dwell without death among rocks and hills,\r\nlakes and seas, bushes and forest, till the day of judgment, the\r\nfairies then have the chance of salvation. Indeed, the fairies are\r\nthemselves believed to have great doubts of a future existence,\r\nthough, like many men, entertaining undefined hopes of happiness; and\r\nhence the enmity which some of them have for mankind, who, they\r\nacknowledge, will live eternally. Thus their actions are balanced\r\nbetween generosity and vindictiveness towards the human race.\r\n\r\nMr. W.Y. Evans Wentz, A.M., of Leland Stanford University,\r\nCalifornia, and Jesus College, Oxford, has received an honorary\r\ndegree from the latter university for his thesis, \"The Fairy Faith in\r\nCeltic Countries: Its Psychical Origin and Nature\", a most laborious\r\nas well as ingenious work, whose object is to prove \"that the origin\r\nof the fairy faith is psychical, and that fairyland, being thought of\r\nas an invisible world within which the visible world is immersed as\r\nan island in an unexplored ocean, actually exists, and that it is\r\npeopled by more species of living beings than this world, because\r\nincomparably more vast and varied in its possibilities.\" This may be\r\nadded as a fourth theory to account for the existence of fairies, and\r\nit may be further stated here that the Irish popular belief in ghosts\r\nattributes to some of their departed spirits much of the same\r\nviolence and malice with which fairies are credited. Mr. Jeremiah\r\nCurtin gives striking instances of this kind in his book, the _Folk\r\nLore of West Kerry_.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary, therefore, for the Gaels who believed in the\r\npreternatural powers of the fairies for good and ill to propitiate\r\nthem as far as possible. On May eve, accordingly, cattle were driven\r\ninto raths and bled there, some of the blood being tasted, the rest\r\npoured out in sacrifice. Men and women were also bled on these\r\noccasions. The seekers for buried treasure, over which fairies were\r\nsupposed to have influence, immolated a black cock or a black cat to\r\npropitiate them. Again, a cow, suffering from sickness believed to be\r\ndue to fairy malice, was bled and then devoted to St. Martin. If it\r\nrecovered, it was never sold or killed. The first new milk of a cow\r\nwas poured out on the ground to propitiate the fairies, and\r\nespecially on the ground within a fairy rath. The first drop of any\r\ndrink is also thrown out by old Irish people. If a child spills milk,\r\nthe mother says, \"that's for the fairies, leave it to them and\r\nwelcome.\" Slops should never be thrown out of doors without the\r\nwarning, \"Take care of water!\" lest fairies should be passing\r\ninvisibly and get soiled by the discharge. Eddies of dust upon the\r\nroad are supposed to be caused by the fairies, and tufts of grass,\r\nsticks, and pebbles are thrown into the centre of the eddy to\r\npropitiate the unseen beings. Some fairies of life size, who live\r\nwithin the green hills or under the raths, are supposed to carry off\r\nhealthy babes to be made fairy children, their abstractors leaving\r\nweak changelings in their place. Similarly, nursing mothers are\r\nsometimes supposed to be carried off to give the breast to fairy\r\nbabes, and handsome young men are spirited away to become bridegrooms\r\nto fairy brides. Again, folk suffering from falling sickness are\r\nsupposed to be in that condition owing to the fatigue caused by\r\nnocturnal rides through the air with the fairies, whose steeds are\r\nbewitched rushes, blades of grass, straws, fern roots, and cabbage\r\nstalks. The latter, to be serviceable for the purpose, should be cut\r\ninto the rude shapes of horses before the metamorphosis can take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIron of every kind keeps away malignant fairies: thus, a horseshoe\r\nnailed to the bottom of the churn prevents butter from being\r\nbewitched. Here is a form of charm against the fairies who have\r\nbewitched the butter: \"Every window should be barred, a great turf\r\nfire should be lit upon which nine irons should be placed, the\r\nbystanders chanting twice over in Irish, 'Come, butter, come; Peter\r\nstands at the gate waiting for a buttered cake.' As the irons become\r\nheated the witch will try to break in, asking the people to take the\r\nirons, which are burning her, off the fire. On their refusing, she\r\nwill go and bring back the butter to the churn. The irons may then be\r\nremoved from the fire and all will go well.\"\r\n\r\nIf a neighbor or stranger should enter a cottage during the churning,\r\nhe should put his hand to the dash, or the butter will not come. A\r\nsmall piece of iron should be sewed into an infant's clothes and kept\r\nthere until the child is baptized, and salt should be sprinkled over\r\nhis cradle to preserve the babe from abduction. The fairies are\r\nsupposed to have been conquered by an iron-weaponed race, and hence\r\ntheir dread of the metal.\r\n\r\nTo recover a spell-bound friend, stand on All Hallows' eve at cross\r\nroads or at a spot pointed out by a wise woman or fairy doctor. When\r\nyou have rubbed fairy ointment on your eyelids, the fairies will\r\nbecome visible as the host sweeps by with its captive, whom the gazer\r\nwill then be able to recognize. A sudden gust announces their\r\napproach. Stooping down, you will then throw dust or milk at the\r\nprocession, whose members are then obliged to surrender your\r\nspell-bound friend. If a man leaves home after his wife's\r\nconfinement, some of his clothes should be spread over the mother and\r\ninfant, or the fairies may carry them off. It is good for a woman,\r\nbut bad for a man, to dream of fairies. It betokens marriage for a\r\ngirl, misfortune for a man, who should not undertake serious business\r\nfor some time after such dreaming.\r\n\r\nFairy changelings may be recognized by tricky habits, constant\r\ncrying, and other unusual characteristics. It was customary to\r\nrecover the true child in the following way: The changeling was\r\nplaced upon an iron shovel over the fire, when it would go shrieking\r\nup the chimney, and the _bona fide_ human child would be restored. It\r\nwas believed that fairy changelings often produced a set of small\r\nbagpipes from under the clothes and played dance music upon them,\r\ntill the inmates of the cottage dropped with exhaustion from the\r\neffects of the step dancing they were compelled to engage in.\r\n\r\nOn Samain eve, the night before the first of November, or, as it is\r\nnow called, All Hallows' night or Hallowe'en, all the fairy hills or\r\n_shees_ are thrown wide open and the fairy host issues forth, as\r\nmortals who are bold enough to venture near may see. Naturally\r\ntherefore people keep indoors so as not to encounter the spectral\r\nhost. The superstition that the fairies are abroad on Samain night\r\nstill exists in Ireland and Scotland, and there is a further belief,\r\nno doubt derived from it, that the graves are open on that night and\r\nthat the spirits of the dead are abroad.\r\n\r\nSalt, as already suggested, is regarded to be so lucky that if a\r\nchild falls, it should always be given three pinches of salt, and if\r\na neighbor calls to borrow salt, it should not be refused, even\r\nthough it be the last grain in the house.\r\n\r\nAn infant born with teeth should have them drawn by the nearest\r\nsmith, and the first teeth when shed should be thrown into the fire,\r\nlest the fairies should get hold of what had been part of you.\r\n\r\nThose who hear fairy music are supposed to be haunted by the melody,\r\nand many are believed to go mad or commit suicide in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe fairies are thought to engage in warfare with one another, and in\r\nthe year 1800 a specially sanguinary battle was believed to have been\r\nfought between two clans of the fairies in county Kilkenny. In the\r\nmorning the hawthorns along the fences were found crushed to pieces\r\nand drenched with blood.\r\n\r\nIn popular belief fairies often go hunting, and faint sounds of fairy\r\nhorns, the baying of fairy hounds, and the cracking of fairy whips\r\nare supposed to be heard on these occasions, while the flight of the\r\nhunters is said to resemble in sound the humming of bees.\r\n\r\nBesides the life-sized fairies who are reputed to have these direct\r\ndealings with human beings, there are diminutive preternatural beings\r\nwho are also supposed to come into close touch with men. Among these\r\nis the Luchryman (_Leithphrogan_), or brogue maker, otherwise known\r\nas Leprechaun. He is always found mending or making a shoe, and, if\r\ngrasped firmly and kept constantly in view, will disclose hidden\r\ntreasure to you, or render up his _sparan na sgillinge_, or purse of\r\nthe (inexhaustible) shilling. He can only be bound by a plough chain\r\nor woolen thread. He is the symbol of industry which, if steadily\r\nfaced, leads to fortune, but, if lost sight of, is followed by its\r\nforfeiture.\r\n\r\nLove in idleness is personified by another pigmy, the _Geancanach_\r\n(love-talker). He does not appear, like the Leprechaun, with a purse\r\nin one of his pockets, but with his hands in both of them, and a\r\n_dudeen_ (short pipe) in his mouth, as he lazily strolls through\r\nlonely valleys making love to the foolish country lasses and\r\n\"gostering\" with the idle \"boys.\" To meet him meant bad luck, and\r\nwhoever was ruined by ill-judged love was said to have been with the\r\n_Geancanach_.\r\n\r\nAnother evil sprite was the _Clobher-ceann_, \"a jolly, red-faced,\r\ndrunken little fellow,\" always \"found astride of a wine-butt\" singing\r\nand drinking from a full tankard in a hard drinker's cellar, and\r\nbound by his appearance to bring its owner to speedy ruin.\r\n\r\nThen there were the _Leannan-sighes_, or native Muses, to be found in\r\nevery place of note to inspire the local bard, and the _Beansighes_\r\n(Banshees, fairy women) attached to each of the old Irish families\r\nand giving warning of the death of one of its members with piteous\r\nlamentations.\r\n\r\nBlack Joanna of the Boyne (_Siubhan Dubh na Boinne_) appeared on\r\nHallowe'en in the shape of a great black fowl, bringing luck to the\r\nhome whose _Banithee_ (woman of the house) kept the dwelling\r\nconstantly clean and neat.\r\n\r\nThe Pooka, who appeared in the shape of a horse, and whom Shakespeare\r\nis by many believed to have adapted as \"Puck,\" was a goblin who\r\ncombined \"horse-play\" with viciousness, but also at times helped with\r\nthe housework.\r\n\r\nThe _Dullaghan_ was a churchyard demon whose head was of a movable\r\nkind. Dr. Joyce writes: \"You generally meet him with his head in his\r\npocket, under his arm, or absent altogether; or if you have the\r\nfortune to light upon a number of _Dullaghans_, you may see them\r\namusing themselves by flinging their heads at one another or kicking\r\nthem for footballs.\"\r\n\r\nAn even more terrible churchyard demon is the fascinating phantom\r\nthat waylays the widower at his wife's very tomb, and poisons him by\r\nher kiss when he has yielded to her blandishments.\r\n\r\nOf monsters the Irish had, and still believe in, the _Piast_ (Latin\r\n_bestia_), a huge dragon or serpent confined to lakes by St. Patrick\r\ntill the day of judgment, but still occasionally seen in their\r\nwaters. In old Fenian times, namely, the days of Finn and his\r\ncompanion knights, the _Piasts_, however, roamed the country,\r\ndevouring men and women and cattle in large numbers, and some of the\r\nearly heroes are recorded to have been swallowed alive by them and\r\nthen to have hewed their way out of their entrails.\r\n\r\nMerrows, or Mermaids, are also still believed in, and many folk tales\r\nexist describing their intermarriage with mortals.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nicholas O'Kearney, \"It is the general opinion of many\r\nold persons versed in native traditional lore, that, before the\r\nintroduction of Christianity, all animals possessed the faculties of\r\nhuman reason and speech; and old story-tellers will gravely inform\r\nyou that every beast could speak before the arrival of St. Patrick,\r\nbut that the saint having expelled the demons from the land by the\r\nsound of his bell, all the animals that, before that time, had\r\npossessed the power of foretelling future events, such as the Black\r\nSteed of _Binn-each-labhra_, the Royal Cat of _Cloughmagh-righ-cat_\r\n(Clough), and others, became mute, and many of them fled to Egypt and\r\nother foreign countries.\"\r\n\r\nCats are said to have been appointed to guard hidden treasures; and\r\nthere are few who have not heard old Irish people tell about strange\r\nmeetings of cats and violent battles fought by them in the\r\nneighborhood. \"It was believed,\" adds O'Kearney, \"that an evil spirit\r\nin the shape of a cat assumed command over these animals in various\r\ndistricts, and that when those wicked beings pleased they could\r\ncompel all the cats belonging to their division to attack those of\r\nsome other district. The same was said of rats; and rat-expellers,\r\nwhen commanding a colony of those troublesome and destructive animals\r\nto emigrate to some other place, used to address their 'billet' to\r\nthe infernal rat supposed to hold command over the rest. In a curious\r\npamphlet on the power of bardic compositions to charm and expel rats,\r\nlately published, Mr. Eugene O'Curry states that a degraded priest,\r\nwho was descended from an ancient family of hereditary bards, was\r\nenabled to expel a colony of rats by the force of satire!\"\r\n\r\nHence, of course, Shakespeare's reference to rhyming Irish rats to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that Irish Fairy Lore well deserves to have been\r\ncalled by Mr. Alfred Nutt, one of the leading authorities on the\r\nsubject, \"as fair and bounteous a harvest of myth and romance as ever\r\nflourished among any race.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nAlex.

Graves.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo record of the glories of Ireland would be complete without an\r\neffort, however inadequate, to analyze and illustrate her wit and\r\nhumor. Often misunderstood, misrepresented, and misinterpreted, they\r\nare nevertheless universally admitted to be racial traits, and for an\r\nexcellent reason. Other nations exhibit these qualities in their\r\nliterature, and Ireland herself is rich in writers who have furnished\r\nfood for mirth. But her special pre-eminence resides in the\r\npossession of what, to adapt a famous phrase, may be called an _anima\r\nnaturaliter jocosa_. Irish wit and Irish humor are a national\r\ninheritance. They are inherent in the race as a whole, independent of\r\neducation or culture or comfort. The best Irish sayings are the\r\nsayings of the people; the greatest Irish humorists are the nameless\r\nmultitude who have never written books or found a place in national\r\ndictionaries of biography. None but an Irishman could have coined\r\nthat supreme expression of contempt: \"I wouldn't be seen dead with\r\nhim at a pig-fair,\" or rebuked a young barrister because he did not\r\n\"squandher his carcass\" (_i.e._, gesticulate) enough. But we cannot\r\ntrace the paternity of these sayings any more than we can that of the\r\nlightning retort of the man to whom one of the \"quality\" had given a\r\nglass of whisky. \"That's made another man of you, Patsy,\" remarked\r\nthe donor. \"'Deed an' it has, sor,\" Patsy flashed back, \"an' that\r\nother man would be glad of another glass.\" It is enough for our\r\npurpose to note that such sayings are typically Irish and that their\r\npeculiar felicity consists in their combining both wit and humor.\r\n\r\nTo what element in the Irish nature are we to attribute this joyous\r\nand illuminating gift? No one who is not a Gaelic scholar can venture\r\nto dogmatize on this thorny subject. But, setting philology and\r\npolitics aside, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Ireland has\r\ngained rather than lost in this respect by the clash of races and\r\nlanguages. Gaiety, we are told, is not the predominating\r\ncharacteristic of the Celtic temperament, nor is it reflected in the\r\nprose and verse of the \"old ancient days\" that have come down to us.\r\nGlamour and magic and passion abound in the lays and legends of the\r\nancient Gael, but there is more melancholy than mirth in these tales\r\nof long ago. Indeed, it is interesting to note in connection with\r\nthis subject that the younger school of Irish writers associated with\r\nwhat is called the Celtic Renascence have, with very few exceptions,\r\nsedulously eschewed anything approaching to jocosity, preferring the\r\npaths of crepuscular mysticism or sombre realism, and openly avowing\r\ntheir distaste for what they consider to be the denationalized\r\nsentiment of Moore, Lever, and Lover. To say this is not to disparage\r\nthe genius of Yeats and Synge; it is merely a statement of fact and\r\nan illustration of the eternal dualism of the Irish temperament,\r\nwhich Moore himself realized when he wrote of \"Erin, the tear and the\r\nsmile in thine eye.\"\r\n\r\nA reaction against the Donnybrook tradition was inevitable and to a\r\ngreat extent wholesome, since the stage Irishman of the transpontine\r\ndrama or the music-halls was for the most part a gross and unlovely\r\ncaricature, but, like all reactions, it has tended to obscure the\r\nreal merits and services of those who showed the other side of the\r\nmedal. Lever did not exaggerate more than Dickens, and his portraits\r\nof Galway fox-hunters and duellists, of soldiers of fortune, and of\r\nDublin undergraduates were largely based on fact. At his best he was\r\na most exhilarating companion, and his pictures of Irish life, if\r\npartial, were not misleading. He held no brief for the landlords, and\r\nin his later novels showed a keen sense of their shortcomings. The\r\nplain fact is that, in considering the literary glories of Ireland,\r\nwe cannot possibly overlook the work of those Irishmen who were\r\naffected by English influences or wrote for an English audience.\r\n\r\nAnglo-Irish humorous literature was a comparatively late product, but\r\nits efflorescence was rapid and triumphant. The first great name is\r\nthat of Goldsmith, and, though deeply influenced in technique and\r\nchoice of subjects by his association with English men of letters and\r\nby his residence in England, in spirit he remained Irish to the\r\nend--generous, impulsive, and improvident in his life; genial, gay,\r\nand tender-hearted in his works. The Vicar of Wakefield was Dr.\r\nPrimrose, but he might just as well have been called Dr. Shamrock. No\r\nsurer proof of the pre-eminence of Irish wit and humor can be found\r\nthan in the fact that, Shakespeare alone excepted, no writers of\r\ncomedy have held the boards longer or more triumphantly than\r\nGoldsmith and his brother Irishman, Sheridan. _She Stoops to Conquer,\r\nThe Rivals, The School for Scandal_, and _The Critic_ represent the\r\nsunny side of the Irish genius to perfection. They illustrate, in the\r\nmost convincing way possible, how the debt of the world to Ireland\r\nhas been increased by the fate which ordained that her choicest\r\nspirits should express themselves in a language of wider appeal than\r\nthe ancient speech of Erin.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, English literature and the English tongue have\r\ngained greatly from the influence exerted by writers familiar from\r\ntheir childhood with turns of speech and modes of expression which,\r\neven when they are not translations from the Gaelic, are\r\ncharacteristic of the Hibernian temper. The late Dr. P.W. Joyce, in\r\nhis admirable treatise on English as spoken in Ireland, has\r\nillustrated not only the essentially bilingual character of the\r\nAnglo-Irish dialect, but the modes of thought which it enshrines.\r\nThere is no better known form of Irish humor than that commonly\r\ncalled the \"Irish bull,\" which is too often set down to lax thinking\r\nand faulty logic. But it is the rarest thing to encounter a genuine\r\nIrish \"bull\" which is not picturesque and at the same time highly\r\nsuggestive. Take, for example, the saying of an old Kerry doctor who,\r\nwhen conversing with a friend on the high rate of mortality,\r\nobserved, \"Bedad, there's people dyin' who never died before.\" Here a\r\ntruly illuminating result was attained by the simple device of using\r\nthe indicative for the conditional mood--as in Juvenal's famous\r\ncomment on Cicero's second Philippic: _Antoni gladios potuit\r\ncontemnere si sic omnia dixisset_. The Irish \"bull\" is a heroic and\r\nsometimes successful attempt to sit upon two stools at once, or, as\r\nan Irishman put it, \"Englishmen often make 'bulls,' but the Irish\r\n'bull' is always pregnant.\"\r\n\r\nThough no names of such outstanding distinction as those of Goldsmith\r\nand Sheridan occur in the early decades of the nineteenth century,\r\nthe spirit of Irish comedy was kept vigorously alive by Maria\r\nEdgeworth, William Maginn, Francis Mahony (Father Prout), and William\r\nCarleton. Sir Walter Scott's splendid tribute to the genius of Maria\r\nEdgeworth is regarded by some critics as extravagant, but it is\r\nlargely confirmed in a most unexpected quarter. Turgenief, the great\r\nRussian novelist, proclaimed himself her disciple, and has left it on\r\nrecord that but for her example he might never have attempted to give\r\nliterary form to his impressions of the classes in Russia\r\ncorresponding to the poor Irish and the squireens and the squires of\r\ncounty Longford. Maginn and Mahony were both scholars--the latter\r\nhappily called himself \"an Irish potato seasoned with Attic\r\nsalt\"--wrote largely for English periodicals, and spent most of their\r\nlives out of Ireland. In the writings of all three an element of the\r\ngrotesque is observable, tempered, however, in the case of Mahony,\r\nwith a vein of tender pathos which emerges in his delightful \"Bells\r\nof Shandon.\" Maginn was a wit, Mahony was the hedge-schoolmaster _in\r\nexcelsis_, and Carleton was the first realist in Irish peasant\r\nfiction. But all alike drew their best inspiration from essentially\r\nIrish themes. The pendulum has swung back slowly but steadily since\r\nthe days when Irish men of letters found it necessary to accommodate\r\ntheir genius to purely English literary standards. Even Lever, though\r\nhe wrote for the English public, wrote mainly about Ireland. So, too,\r\nwith his contemporary Le Fanu, whose reputation rests on a double\r\nbasis. He made some wonderful excursions into the realm of the\r\nbizarre, the uncanny, and the gruesome. But in the collection known\r\nas _The Purcell Papers_ will be found three short stories which for\r\nexuberant drollery and \"diversion\" have never been excelled. That the\r\nsame man could have written _Uncle Silas_ and _The Quare Gander_ is\r\nyet another proof of the strange dualism of the Irish character.\r\n\r\nThe record of the last fifty years shows an uninterrupted progress in\r\nthe invasion of English _belles lettres_ by Irish writers. Outside\r\nliterature, perhaps the most famous sayer of good things of our times\r\nwas a simple Irish parish priest, the late Father Healy. Of his\r\nhumorous sayings the number is legion; his wit may be illustrated by\r\na less familiar example--his comment on a very tall young lady named\r\nLynch: \"Nature gave her an inch and she took an ell.\" In the House of\r\nCommons today there is no greater master of irony and sardonic humor\r\nthan his namesake, Mr. Tim Healy. On one occasion he remarked that\r\nLord Rosebery was not a man to go tiger-shooting with--except at the\r\nZoo. On another, being anxious to bring an indictment against the\r\n\"Castle\" _régime_ in Dublin and finding the way blocked by a debate\r\non Uganda, he successfully accomplished his purpose by a judicious\r\ngeographical transference of names, and convulsed the House by a\r\nspeech in which the nomenclature of Central Africa was applied to the\r\ngovernment of Ireland.\r\n\r\nBut wit and humor are the monopoly of no class or calling in Ireland.\r\nThey flourish alike among car-drivers and K.C.'s, publicans and\r\npolicemen, priests and parsons, beggars and peers. It is a\r\ncommonplace of criticism to deny these qualities in their highest\r\nform to women. But this is emphatically untrue of Ireland, and was\r\nnever more conclusively disproved than by the recent literary\r\nachievements of her daughters. The partnership of two Irish ladies,\r\nMiss Edith Somerville and Miss Violet Martin, has given us, in _Some\r\nExperiences of an Irish R.M._ (_i.e._, Resident Magistrate), the most\r\ndelicious comedy, and in _The Real Charlotte_ the finest\r\ntragi-comedy, that have come out of Great Britain in the last thirty\r\nyears. The _R.M._, as it is familiarly called, is already a classic,\r\nbut the Irish _comédie humaine_--to use the phrase in the sense of\r\nBalzac--is even more vividly portrayed in the pages of _The Real\r\nCharlotte_. Humor, genuine though intermittent, irradiates the\r\nautumnal talent of Miss Jane Barlow, and the long roll of gifted\r\nIrishwomen who have contributed to the gaiety of nations may be\r\nclosed with the names of Miss Hunt, author of _Folk Tales of\r\nBreffny_; of Miss Purdon and Miss Winifred Letts, who in prose and\r\nverse, respectively, have moved us to tears and laughter by their\r\nstudies of Leinster peasant life; and of \"Moira O'Neill\" (Mrs.\r\nSkrine), the incomparable singer of the Glens of Antrim. To give a\r\nfull list of the living Irish writers, male and female, who are\r\nengaged in the benevolent work of driving dull care away would be\r\nimpossible within the space at our command. But we cannot end without\r\nrecognition of the exhilarating extravaganzas of \"George A.\r\nBirmingham\" (Canon Hannay), the freakish and elfin muse of James\r\nStephens, and the coruscating wit of F.P. Dunne, the famous\r\nIrish-American humorist, whose \"Mr. Dooley\" is a household word on\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nGoldsmith: Vicar of Wakefield, She Stoops to Conquer; Sheridan: The\r\nRivals, The School for Scandal, The Critic; R.

And when fine impersonators of Irish character\r\nlike Tyrone Power, John Drew, or Barney Williams arrived, there were\r\nalways to be found several clever writers to fit them with parts, the\r\ndemand always creating the supply.\r\n\r\nEven before Dion Boucicault took to writing Irish dramas of a more\r\npalatable and less \"stage-Irish\" character than those of his\r\nimmediate predecessors, some excellent plays, Irish in character and\r\ntone, had from time to time found their way to the stage. However,\r\nBoucicault sweetened our stage by the production of _The Colleen\r\nBawn, Arrah-na-Pogue_, and _The Shaughraun_, and showed by his\r\nrollicking impersonations of Myles, Shan, and Conn, how good-humored,\r\nhearty, and self-sacrificing Irish boys in humble life can be. He had\r\ngreat technical knowledge of stagecraft, and that has helped to make\r\nhis Irish plays live in the popular goodwill right up to today.\r\n\r\nA revolt against Boucicault's Irish boys, all fun and frolic, and\r\ncharming colleens, who could do no wrong, has made our modern\r\nplaywrights go to the other extreme; so that now we find our stage\r\npeopled with peasants, cruel, hard, and forbidding for the most part,\r\nand with colleens who are the reverse of lovable in thought or act.\r\nNeither picture is quite true of our people. What is really wanted is\r\nthe happy medium, which few, if any, of our new playwrights have yet\r\ngiven us.\r\n\r\nIf our great popular Irish drama has yet to come, I think the Fays\r\nhave made it possible to say that a distinct and really fine dramatic\r\nschool has arisen in Ireland, evolved out of their wonderful skill in\r\nteaching, producing, and acting; and if we are not always really\r\ndelighted with what our playwrights give us, the almost perfect way\r\nin which the plays are served up by the actors invariably wholly\r\nsatisfies. It is the actors who have made the Abbey Theatre famous,\r\nand not the plays. Such acting as theirs cast a spell over all who\r\nsee them. What pleasing memories do the names of W.G. Fay, Frank J.\r\nFay, Dudley Digges, Sara Allgood, Arthur Sinclair, Maire O'Neill,\r\nMaire ni Shuiblaigh, J.M. Kerrigan, Fred O'Donovan, Eileen O'Doherty,\r\nUna O'Connor, Eithne Magee, Nora Desmond, and John Connolly recall!\r\n\r\nWith the production of W.B. Yeats's poetic one-act play, _The Land of\r\nHeart's Desire_, at the Avenue Theatre, London, on March 29, 1894,\r\nbegan the modern Irish dramatic movement. When the poet had tasted\r\nthe joys of the footlights, he longed to see an Irish Literary\r\nTheatre realized in Ireland. Five years later, in the Antient Concert\r\nRooms, Dublin, on May 9, 1899, his play, _The Countess Cathleen_, was\r\nproduced, and his desire gratified. The experiment was tried for\r\nthree years and then dropped; plays by Yeats, Edward Martyn, George\r\nMoore, and Alice Milligan were staged with English-trained actors in\r\nthe casts; and a Gaelic play--the first ever presented in a theatre\r\nin Ireland--was also given during the third season. It was _The\r\nTwisting of the Rope_, by Dr. Douglas Hyde, and was played at the\r\nGaiety Theatre, Dublin, on October 21, 1901, by a Gaelic Amateur\r\nDramatic Society coached by W.G. Fay. The author filled the principal\r\npart with distinction.\r\n\r\nIt was while rehearsing this play that the thought came to Fay: \"Why\r\nnot have my little company of Irish-born actors--the Ormond Dramatic\r\nSociety--appear in plays by Irish writers instead of in the ones they\r\nhave been giving for years?\" And the thought soon ripened into\r\nrealization. His brother, Frank, had dreamed of such a company since\r\nhe read of the small beginnings out of which the Norwegian Theatre\r\nhad grown; and just then, seeing some of \"Æ's\" (George Russell's)\r\nplay, _Deirdre_, in the _All Ireland Review_, he asked the author if\r\nhe would allow them to produce it, and, consent being given, the\r\ncompany put it into rehearsal at once. \"Æ\" got for them from Yeats\r\n_Kathleen-Ni-Houlihan_, to make up the programme. Thus it was that\r\nthis company of amateurs and poets, now known as the Abbey Players,\r\ncame into existence, and at St. Teresa's Hall, Clarendon Street,\r\nDublin, gave their first performance on April 2, 1902.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards they took a hall at the back of a shop in Camden\r\nStreet, where they rehearsed and gave a few public performances. On\r\n\"Æ\" declining to be their president, Frank Fay suggested the name of\r\nW.B. Yeats, and he was elected, and in that way came again into the\r\nmovement in which he has figured so largely ever since.\r\n\r\nThe company played occasionally in the Molesworth Hall, and produced\r\nthere, among other pieces, Synge's _In the Shadow of the Glen_\r\n(October 8, 1903) and _Riders to the Sea_ (February 25, 1904);\r\nYeats's _The Hour Glass_ (March 14, 1903) and _The King's Threshold_\r\n(October 8, 1903); Lady Gregory's _Twenty-five_ (March 14,1903); and\r\nPadraic Colum's _Broken Soil_ (December 3, 1903).\r\n\r\nOn March 26, 1904, the company paid a flying one-day visit to the\r\nRoyalty, London, and Miss A.E.F. Horniman, who had given Shaw, Yeats,\r\nand Dr. John Todhunter their first real start as playwrights at the\r\nAvenue, London, in March-April, 1894 (Shaw had had his first play,\r\n_Widowers' Houses_, played by the Independent Theatre in 1892), saw\r\nthe performance, and was so impressed that she thought she would like\r\nto find a suitable home for such talent in Dublin, and fixed upon the\r\nold Mechanics' Institute and its surrounding buildings, and there the\r\nAbbey Theatre soon afterwards--on December 27, 1904--came into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIn writing of this Irish dramatic movement, one must always bear in\r\nmind that it was Yeats who first conceived the idea of such a\r\nmovement; the Fays who founded the school of Irish acting; and Miss\r\nHorniman who, like a fairy godmother, waved the wand, and gave it a\r\nhabitation and a name--the Abbey Theatre--and endowed it for six\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nPlay followed play with great rapidity, and dramatic societies sprang\r\nup all over the country, playing home-made productions in Gaelic and\r\nEnglish. All Ireland seemed to be play-acting and play-writing; so\r\nmuch so that Frank Fay was heard to say that \"he thought everyone had\r\na play in his pocket, and that anyone in the street could be picked\r\nup and shaped into an actor or actress with a little training,\r\nIreland was so teeming with talent!\"\r\n\r\nDramatic Ireland had slumbered for a long while, and awoke with\r\ntremendous vigor for work. New dramatists sprang up in all parts of\r\nIreland; The Ulster Literary Theatre started in Belfast; The Cork\r\nDramatic Society, in Cork; The Theatre of Ireland, in Dublin; and\r\nothers in Galway and Waterford soon followed. In Dublin at present\r\nmore than half a dozen dramatic societies are continually producing\r\nnew plays and discovering new acting talent. There are also two\r\nGaelic dramatic societies. And nearly every town in Ireland now has\r\nits own dramatic class and its own dramatists. All this activity has\r\ncome about within the last ten or twelve years, where, before, in\r\nmany places, drama and acting were almost unknown.\r\n\r\nMany Gaelic societies throughout the country put on Gaelic plays by\r\nDr. Douglas Hyde, Pierce Beasley, Thomas Haynes, Canon Peter O'Leary,\r\nand others; and the _Oireachtas_ (the Gaelic musical and literary\r\nfestival) held each year in Dublin usually presents several Irish\r\nplays and offers prizes for new ones at each festival.\r\n\r\nOf all the Irish playwrights who have arisen in recent years, Lady\r\nGregory has produced most and W.B. Yeats is the most poetic. He is\r\nmore a lyric poet than a dramatist, and is never satisfied with his\r\nwork for the stage, but keeps eternally chopping and changing it. His\r\n_Kathleen-Ni-Houlihan_, though a dream-play, always appeals to an\r\naudience of Irish people. Perhaps his one-act _Deirdre_ is the\r\nnearest approach to real drama he has done. Some of Lady Gregory's\r\nearlier one-act farces, such as _The Workhouse-Ward_, are very\r\namusing; _The Rising of the Moon_ is a little dramatic gem, and _The\r\nGaol Gate_ is touched with genuine tragedy. Synge wrote only one\r\nplay--_Riders to the Sea_--that acts well. The others are admired by\r\ncritics for the strangeness of their diction and the beauty of the\r\nnature-pictures scattered through them. His much-discussed _Playboy\r\nof the Western World_ has become famous for the rows it has created\r\nat home and abroad from its very first production on January 26,\r\n1907. William Boyle, who gets to the heart of those he writes about,\r\nhas produced the most popular play of the movement in _The Eloquent\r\nDempsey_, and a perfectly constructed one in _The Building Fund_.\r\nW.F. Casey's two plays--_The Man Who Missed the Tide_ and _The\r\nSuburban Groove_--are both popular and actable. Padraic Colum's\r\nplays--_The Land_ and _Broken Soil_ (the latter rewritten and renamed\r\n_The Fiddler's House_)--are almost idyllic scenes of country life.\r\nLennox Robinson's plays are harsh in tone, but dramatically\r\neffective, and T.C. Murray's _Birthright_ and _Maurice Harte_ are\r\nfine dramas, well constructed and full of true knowledge of the\r\npeople he writes about. Seumas O'Kelly has written two strong dramas\r\nin _The Shuiler's Child_ and _The Bribe_, and Seumas O'Brien one of\r\nthe funniest Irish farces ever staged in _Duty_. R.J. Ray's play,\r\n_The Casting Out of Martin Whelan_, is the best this dramatist has as\r\nyet given us, and George Fitzmaurice's _The Country Dressmaker_ has\r\nthe elements of good drama in it. St. John G. Ervine has written a\r\nvery human drama in _Mixed Marriage_. He hails from the north of\r\nIreland; but Rutherford Mayne is the best of the Northern\r\nplaywrights, and his plays, _The Drone_ and _The Turn of the Road_,\r\nare splendid homely county Down comedies.\r\n\r\nBernard Shaw's _John Bull's Other Island_, as Irish plays go, is a\r\nfine specimen; Canon Hannay has written two successful comedies,\r\n_Eleanor's Enterprise_ and _General John Regan_--the latter not\r\nwholly to the taste of the people of the west. James Stephens and\r\nJane Barlow have also tried their hands at playwriting, with but\r\nmoderate success. Perhaps the modern drama that made the most\r\nimpression when first played was _The Heather Field_, by Edward\r\nMartyn. It gripped and remains a lasting memory with all who saw it\r\nin 1899. But I think I have written enough to show that the Irish\r\nTheatre of today is in a very alive condition, and that if the great\r\nNational Dramatist has not yet arrived, he is sure to emerge. When\r\nthat time comes, the actors are here ready to interpret such work to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nAn article, however brief, on the Irish Theatre, would be incomplete\r\nwithout mention of the world-famous tragedians, John Edward\r\nMacCullough, Lawrence Patrick Barrett, and Barry Sullivan; of genial\r\ncomedians like Charles Sullivan and Hubert O'Grady; of sterling\r\nactors like Shiel Barry, John Brougham, Leonard Boyne, J.D.\r\nBeveridge, and Thomas Nerney; or of operatic artists like Denis\r\nO'Sullivan and Joseph O'Mara--many of whom have passed away, but\r\nsome, fortunately, are with us still.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nJohn Genest: Some Account of the English Stage from the Restoration\r\nto 1830 (1832; vol. 10 is devoted to the Irish Stage); Chetwood:\r\nGeneral History of the Stage, more particularly of the Irish Theatre\r\n(Dublin, 1749); Molloy: Romance of the Irish Stage; Baker: Biographia\r\nDramatica (Dublin, 1782); Hitchcock: An Historical View of the Irish\r\nStage from its Earliest Period down to the Season of 1788; Doran:\r\nTheir Majesties' Servants, or Annals of the English Stage (London,\r\n1865); Hughes: The Pre-Victorian Drama in Dublin; The History of the\r\nTheatre Royal, Dublin (Dublin, 1870); Levey and O'Rourke: Annals of\r\nthe Theatre Royal (Dublin, 1880); O'Neill: Irish Theatrical History\r\n(Dublin, 1910); Brown: A Guide to Books on Ireland (Dublin, 1912);\r\nLawrence: The Abbey Theatre (in the Weekly Freeman, Dublin, Dec.,\r\n1912), Origin of the Abbey Theatre (in Sinn Fein, Dublin, Feb. 14,\r\n1914); Weygandt: Irish Plays and Playwrights (London, 1913); Lady\r\nGregory: Our Irish Theatre (London, 1914); Bourgeois: John M.

One of the greatest newspaper organizers of modern times is\r\nLord Northcliffe. As the principal proprietor and guiding mind of\r\nboth the _Times_ and the _Daily Mail_, he directly influences public\r\nopinion, from the steps of the Throne and the door of the Cabinet, to\r\nthe errand boy and the servant maid. T.P. O'Connor, M.P., is the most\r\npopular writer on current social and political topics, and so amazing\r\nis his versatility that every subject he touches is illumined by\r\nthose fine qualities, vision and sincerity. The most renowned of\r\npolitical writers is J.L. Garvin of the _Pall Mall Gazette_ and the\r\n_Observer_. By his leading articles he has done as much as the late\r\nJoseph Chamberlain by his speeches to democratize and humanize the\r\nold Tory party of England. The authoritative special correspondent,\r\nstudying at first hand all the problems which divide the nations of\r\nEurope, and knowing personally most of its rulers and statesmen, is\r\nE.J. Dillon of the _Daily Telegraph_. And when the quarrels of\r\nnations are transferred from the chancelleries to the stricken field\r\nthere is no one among the war correspondents more enterprising and\r\nintrepid in his methods, or more picturesque and vivid with his pen,\r\nthan M.H. Donohoe of the _Daily Chronicle_. All these men are Irish.\r\nCould there be more striking proof of the natural bent and aptitude\r\nof the Irish mind for journalism?\r\n\r\nDean Swift was the mightiest journalist that ever stirred the\r\nsluggish soul of humanity. Were he alive today and had he at his\r\ncommand the enormous circulation of a great daily newspaper, he would\r\nkeep millions in a perpetual mental ferment, such was the ferocious\r\nindignation into which he was aroused by wrong and injustice and his\r\ngift of savage ironical expression. Swift, as a young student in\r\nTrinity College, Dublin, saw the birth of the first offspring of the\r\nIrish mind in journalism. The _Dublin News Letter_ made its\r\nappearance in June, 1685, and was published every three or four days\r\nfor the circulation of news and advertisements. Only one copy of the\r\nfirst issue of this, the earliest of Irish newspapers, is extant. It\r\nis included in the Thorpe collection of tracts in the Royal Dublin\r\nSociety. Dated August 26, 1685, it consists of a single leaf of paper\r\nprinted on both sides, and contains just one item of news, a letter\r\nbrought by the English packet from London, and two local\r\nadvertisements. As I reverently handled it, I was thrilled by the\r\nthought that from this insignificant little seed sprang the great\r\nnational organ, the _Freeman's Journal_; the _Press_ of the United\r\nIrishmen; the _Nation_ of the Young Irelanders; the _United Ireland_\r\nof the Land League; the _Irish World_ and the _Boston Pilot_ of the\r\nAmerican Irish; and the _Irish Independent_, the first half-penny\r\nDublin morning paper, and the most widely circulated of Irish\r\njournals. If Swift did not write for the _Dublin News Letter_, he\r\ncertainly wrote for the _Examiner_, a weekly miscellany published in\r\nthe Irish capital from 1710 to 1713, and the first journal that\r\nendeavored to create public opinion in Ireland. It was at Swift's\r\ninstigation that this paper was started, and he was doubtless\r\nencouraged to suggest it by the success that attended his articles in\r\nthe contemporary London publication of the same name, the Tory\r\n_Examiner_, in which his journalistic genius was fully revealed. As\r\nit has been expressively put, he wrote his friends, Harley and St.\r\nJohn, into a firm grip of power, and thus, as in other ways,\r\ncontributed his share to the inauguration and maintenance of that\r\npolicy which in the last four years of Queen Anne so materially\r\nrecast the whole European situation. About the same time there\r\nappeared in London the earliest forms of the periodical essay in the\r\n_Tatler_ and the _Spectator_, which exhibit the comprehensiveness of\r\nthe Irish temperament in writing by affording a contrast between the\r\nIrish force and vehemence of Swift and the Irish play of kindly wit\r\nand tender pathos in the deft and dainty periods of Richard Steele.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Lucas was, even more than Swift perhaps, the precursor of\r\nthat type of Irish publicist and journalist, of which there have been\r\nmany splendid examples since then in Ireland, England, and America.\r\nLucas first started the _Censor_, a weekly journal, in 1748. Within\r\ntwo years his paper was suppressed for exciting discontent with the\r\ngovernment, and to avoid a prosecution he fled to England. In 1763\r\nthe _Freeman's Journal_ was established by three Dublin merchants.\r\nLucas, who had returned from a long exile and was a member of the\r\nIrish parliament, contributed to it, sometimes anonymously but\r\ngenerally over the signature of \"A Citizen\" or \"Civis.\" The editor\r\nwas Henry Brooks, novelist, poet, and playwright. His novel, _The\r\nFool of Quality_, is still read. His tragedy, _The Earl of Essex_,\r\nwas, wrongly, supposed to contain a precept, \"Who rules o'er freemen\r\nshould himself be free,\" which led to the more famous parody of Dr.\r\nSamuel Johnson, \"Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat.\" The\r\nobject of Lucas and Brooke, as journalists, was to awaken national\r\nsentiment, by teaching that Ireland had an individuality of her own\r\nindependently of England. But they were more concerned with the\r\nassertion of the constitutional rights of the parliament of the\r\nProtestant colony as against the domination of England. Therefore,\r\nthe first organ of Irish Nationality, representative of all creeds\r\nand classes, was the _Press_, the newspaper of the United Irishmen,\r\nwhich was started in Dublin in 1797, by Arthur O'Connor, the son of a\r\nrich merchant who had made his money in London. Its editor was Peter\r\nFinnerty, born of humble parentage at Loughrea, afterwards a famous\r\nparliamentary reporter for the London _Morning Chronicle_, and its\r\nmost famous contributor was Dr. William Drennan, the poet, who first\r\ncalled Ireland \"the Emerald Isle.\"\r\n\r\nIrishmen did not become prominently associated with American\r\njournalism until after the Famine and the collapse of the Young\r\nIreland movement in 1848. The journalist whom I regard as having\r\nexercised the most fateful influence on the destinies of Ireland was\r\nCharles Gavan Duffy, the founder and first editor of the _Nation_, a\r\nnewspaper of which it was truly and finely said that it brought a new\r\nsoul into Erin. Among its contributors, who afterwards added lustre\r\nto the journalism of the United States, was John Mitchel. In the\r\n_Southern Citizen_ and the _Richmond Enquirer_ he supported the South\r\nagainst the North in the Civil War. The Rev. Abram Joseph Ryan, who\r\nwas associated with journalism in New Orleans, not only acted as a\r\nCatholic chaplain with the Confederate army, but sang of its hopes\r\nand aspirations in tuneful verse. Serving in the army of the North\r\nwas Charles G. Halpine, whose songs signed \"Private Miles O'Reilly\"\r\nwere very popular in those days of national convulsion in the United\r\nStates. Halpine's father had edited the Tory newspaper, the Dublin\r\n_Evening Mail_; and Halpine himself, after the war, edited the\r\n_Citizen_ of New York, famous for its advocacy of reforms in civic\r\nadministration. Perhaps the two most renowned men in Irish-American\r\njournalism were John Boyle O'Reilly of the _Boston Pilot_ and Patrick\r\nFord of the _Irish World_. O'Reilly was a troop-sergeant in the 10th\r\nHussars (Prince of Wales's Own), and during the Fenian troubles of\r\n1866 had eighty of his men ready armed and mounted to take out of\r\nIsland Bridge Barracks, Dublin, at a given signal, to aid the\r\nprojected insurrection. Detected, he was brought to trial, summarily\r\nconvicted, and sentenced to be shot. This sentence was commuted to\r\ntwenty-five years' penal servitude; but O'Reilly survived it all to\r\nbecome a brilliant man of letters and make the _Boston Pilot_ one of\r\nthe most influential Irish and Catholic newspapers in the United\r\nStates. Ford, who had served his apprenticeship as a compositor in\r\nthe office of William Lloyd Garrison at Boston, founded the _Irish\r\nWorld_ in 1870. This newspaper gave powerful aid to the Land League.\r\nA special issue of 1,650,000 copies of the _Irish World_ was printed\r\non January 11, 1879, for circulation in Ireland; and money to the\r\namount of $600,000 altogether was sent by Ford to the headquarters of\r\nthe agitation in Dublin. A journalist of a totally different kind was\r\nEdwin Lawrence Godkin. Born in County Wicklow, the son of a\r\nPresbyterian clergyman, Godkin in 1865 established the _Nation_ in\r\nNew York as an organ of independent thought; and for thirty-five\r\nyears he filled a unique position, standing aside from all parties,\r\nsects, and bodies, and yet permeating them all with his sane and\r\nrestraining philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, Thomas D'Arcy Magee won fame as a journalist on the _New\r\nEra_ before he became even more distinguished as a parliamentarian.\r\nWhen the history of Australian journalism is written it will contain\r\ntwo outstanding Irish names: Daniel Henry Deniehy, who died in 1865,\r\nwas called by Bulwer Lytton \"the Australian Macaulay\" on account of\r\nhis brilliant writings as critic and reviewer in the press of\r\nVictoria. Gerald Henry Supple, another Dublin man, is also remembered\r\nfor his contributions to the _Age_ and the _Argus_ of Melbourne. In\r\nIndia one of the first--if not the first--English newspapers was\r\nfounded by a Limerick man, named Charles Johnstone, who had\r\npreviously attained fame as the author of _Chrysal, or the Adventures\r\nof a Guinea_, and who died at Calcutta about 1800.\r\n\r\nStirring memories of battle and adventure leap to the mind at the\r\nnames of those renowned war correspondents, William Howard Russell,\r\nEdmond O'Donovan, and James J. O'Kelly. Russell, a Dublin man, was\r\nthe first newspaper representative to accompany an army into the\r\nfield. He saw all the mighty engagements of the Crimea--Alma,\r\nBalaclava, Inkerman, Sebastopol--not from a distance of 60 or 80\r\nmiles, which is the nearest that correspondents are now allowed to\r\napproach the front, but at the closest quarters, riding through the\r\nlines on his mule, and seeing the engagements vividly, so that he was\r\nable to describe them in moving detail for readers of the _Times_.\r\nO'Donovan--son of Dr. John O'Donovan, the distinguished Irish scholar\r\nand archaeologist--was in the service of the London _Daily News_.\r\nThat dashing campaigner--as his famous book, _The Merv Oasis_, shows\r\nhim to have been--perished with Hicks Pasha's Army in the Sudan in\r\nNovember, 1883. At the same time James O'Kelly, also of the _Daily\r\nNews_, was lost in the desert, trying to join the forces of the\r\nvictorious Sudanese under the Madhi. Ten years before that he had\r\naccomplished, for the New York _Herald_, the equally daring and\r\nhazardous feat of joining the Cuban rebels in revolt against Spain.\r\nHe escaped the perils of the Mambi Land and the Sudan, and survived\r\nto serve Ireland for many years as a Nationalist member in the\r\nBritish parliament. John Augustus O'Shea, better known, perhaps, as\r\n\"The Irish Bohemian\", also deserves remembrance for his quarter of a\r\ncentury's work as special correspondent in Europe--including Paris\r\nduring the siege--for the London _Standard_.\r\n\r\nIndeed, no matter to what side of journalism we turn, we find\r\nIrishmen filling the foremost and the highest places. John Thaddeus\r\nDelane, under whose editorship the _Times_ became for a time the most\r\ninfluential newspaper in the world, was of Irish parentage. The first\r\neditor of the _Illustrated London News_ (1842)--one of the pioneers\r\nin the elucidation of news by means of pictures--was an Irishman,\r\nFrederick Bayley. Among the projectors of _Punch_, and one of its\r\nearliest contributors, was a King's county man, Joseph Sterling\r\nCoyne. The founder of the _Liverpool Daily Post_ (1855), the first\r\npenny daily paper in Great Britain, was Michael Joseph Whitty, a\r\nWexford man. His son, Edward M. Whitty, was the originator of that\r\ninteresting feature of English and Irish journalism, the sketch of\r\npersonalities and proceedings in parliament. Of the editors of the\r\n_Athenaeum_--for many years the leading English organ of literary\r\ncriticism--one of the most famous was Dr. John Doran, who was of\r\nIrish parentage. \"Dod\" is a familiar household word in the British\r\nParliament. It is the name of the recognized guide to the careers and\r\npolitical opinions of Lords and Commons. Its founder was an Irishman,\r\nCharles Roger Dod, who for twenty-three years was a parliamentary\r\nreporter for the _Times_. And what name sheds a brighter light on the\r\nannals of British journalism for intellectual and imaginative force\r\nthan that of Justin MacCarthy, novelist and historian, as well as\r\nnewspaper writer?\r\n\r\nAt home in Ireland the name of Gray is inseparably associated with\r\nthe _Freeman's Journal_. Under the direction of Dr. John Gray this\r\nnewspaper became in the sixties and seventies the most powerful organ\r\nof public opinion in Ireland; and in the eighties it was raised still\r\nhigher in ability and influence by his son and successor, Edmund\r\nDwyer Gray. In the south of Ireland the most influential daily\r\nnewspaper is the _Cork Examiner_, which was founded in 1841 by John\r\nFrancis Maguire, who wrote in 1868 _The Irish in America_. It is\r\ndoubtful whether any country ever produced a more militant and able\r\npolitical journal than was _United Ireland_ in the stormy years\r\nduring which it was edited by William O'Brien as the organ of the\r\nLand League.\r\n\r\nThe Irish mood is gregarious, expansive, glowing, and eager to keep\r\nin intimate touch with the movements and affairs of humanity. That, I\r\nthink, is the secret of its success in journalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nMadden: Irish Periodical Literature (1867); Andrews: English\r\nJournalism (1855); North: Newspaper and Periodical Press of the\r\nUnited States (1884); MacDonagh: The Reporter's Gallery (1913).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH LITERARY REVIVAL\r\n\r\nBy HORATIO S. KRANS, Ph.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the closing decade of the nineteenth century and in the opening\r\nyears of the twentieth, no literary movement has awakened a livelier\r\ninterest than the Irish Literary Revival, a movement which, by its\r\nsingleness and solidarity of purpose, stood alone in a time of\r\nconfused literary aims and tendencies. Movements, like individuals,\r\nhave their ancestry, and that of the Irish Literary Revival is easily\r\ntraced. It descends from Callanan and Walsh, and from the writers of\r\n'48. It is to this descent that the lines in William Butler Yeats's\r\n\"To Ireland in Coming Times\" allude:\r\n\r\n      Know that I would accounted be\r\n      True brother of that company,\r\n      Who sang to sweeten Ireland's wrong,\r\n      Ballad and story, rann and song.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of the mid-nineteenth-century writers, the old\r\nmovement waned, and in the field of Irish letters there was, in the\r\nphrase of a famous bull, nothing stirring but stagnation. A witty\r\ncritic of the period, commenting upon this unhappy state of affairs,\r\ndeclared that, though the love of learning in Ireland might still be,\r\nas the saying went, indestructible, it was certainly imperceptible.\r\nBut after the fall of Parnell a new spirit was stirring. Politics no\r\nlonger absorbed the whole energy of the nation. Groups of men\r\ninspired with a love of the arts sprang up here and there. In 1890\r\nYeats proved himself a real prophet when he wrote: \"A true literary\r\nconsciousness--national to the centre--seems gradually to be forming\r\nout of all this disguising and prettifying, this penumbra of\r\nhalf-culture. We are preparing likely enough for a new Irish literary\r\nmovement--like that of '48--that will show itself in the first lull\r\nin politics.\"\r\n\r\nResponsive to the need of the young writers associated with Yeats,\r\nthe National Literary Society was founded in Dublin in 1892, and a\r\nyear later London Irishmen, among them men already distinguished in\r\nletters, founded in the English metropolis the Irish Literary\r\nSociety. From the presses in Dublin, in London, and in New York as\r\nwell, books began to appear in rapid succession--slender volumes of\r\nverse, novels, short stories, essays, plays, translations, and\r\nremakings of Irish myths and legends, all inspired by, and closely\r\nrelated to, the past or the present of Ireland, voicing an\r\nessentially national spirit and presenting the noblest traits of\r\nIrish life and character.\r\n\r\nNot content with the organization of the two literary societies,\r\nYeats, with courage and relentless tenacity, cast about to realize\r\nhis long-cherished dream of a theatre that should embody the ideals\r\nof the Revival. In Lady Gregory, and in Edward Martyn, an Irishman of\r\nlarge means, who with both pen and purse lent a willing hand, he\r\nfound two ardent laborers for his vineyard. George Moore, who in the\r\nevent proved a fish out of water in Ireland, Yeats and Martyn\r\ncontrived to lure from his London lodgings and his cosmopolitan ways,\r\nand to enlist in the theatrical enterprise. The practical knowledge\r\nof the stage which this gifted _enfant terrible_ of literature\r\ncontributed was doubtless of great value in the early days of the\r\ndramatic adventure, though Moore's free thoughts, frank speech, and\r\nmordant irony brought an element of discord into Dublin literary\r\ncircles, which may well have left Yeats and his associates with a\r\nfeeling that they had paid too dear for a piper to whose tunes they\r\nrefused to dance. Be that as it may, in 1899 Yeats's dream was\r\nmeasurably realized, and the Irish Literary Theatre established, to\r\nbe succeeded a little later by the Irish National Theatre Society.\r\nEnough, however, of the dramatic aspect of the Revival, which\r\nreceives separate treatment elsewhere in these pages, as does also\r\nthe dramatic work of certain of the authors considered here.\r\n\r\nFrom what has already been said, it should be plain that in the last\r\ndecade of the last century the ranks of the Irish Literary\r\nRevivalists filled rapidly, and that the movement was really under\r\nway. The renascent spirit took various forms. To one group of poets\r\nthe humor, pathos, and tragedy of peasant life deeply appealed, and\r\nfound expression in a poetry distinctively and unmistakably national,\r\nfrom which a kind of pleasure could be drawn unlike anything else in\r\nother literatures. In this group Alfred Perceval Graves and Moira\r\nO'Neill cannot pass unmentioned. Who would ask anything racier in its\r\nkind than the former's \"Father O'Flynn\"?\r\n\r\n      Of priests we can offer a charmin' variety,\r\n      Far renowned for larnin' and piety,\r\n      Still I'd advance you without impropriety,\r\n      Father O'Flynn as the flower of them all.\r\n         Here's a health to you, Father O'Flynn,\r\n         Slainte,[1] and slainte, and slainte agin.\r\n            Powerfullest preacher,\r\n            And tinderest teacher,\r\n      And kindliest creature in Old Donegal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Your health.\"]\r\n\r\nOr was the homing instinct, the homesick longing for the old sod,\r\never more truly rendered than in Moira O'Neill's song of the Irish\r\nlaborer in England?\r\n\r\n      Over here in England I'm helpin' wi' the hay,\r\n      An' I wish I was in Ireland the livelong day;\r\n      Weary on the English, an' sorra take the wheat!\r\n      Och! Corrymeela an' the blue sky over it.\r\n\r\n      D'ye mind me now, the song at night is mortial hard to raise,\r\n      The girls are heavy-goin' here, the boys are ill to plase;\r\n      When ones't I'm out this workin' hive, 'tis I'll be back again--\r\n      Aye, Corrymeela in the same soft rain.\r\n\r\nHere, too, should be named Jane Barlow, whose poems and stories are\r\nfaithful imaginative transcripts of the face of nature and the hearts\r\nof men as she knew them in Connemara. Finally there is William Butler\r\nYeats, who, on the whole, is the representative man of the Revival.\r\nExcept in the translator's sphere, his writings have given him a\r\nplace in almost all the activities of this movement. As a lyric poet,\r\nhe has expressed the moods of peasant and patriot, of mystic,\r\nsymbolist, and quietist, and it is safe to say that in lyric poetry\r\nno one of his generation writing in English is his superior. We\r\ncannot resist the pleasure of quoting here from his \"Innisfree\",\r\nwhich won the praise of Robert Louis Stevenson, and which, if not the\r\nhigh mark of Yeats's achievement, is still a flawless thing in its\r\nway:\r\n\r\n      I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,\r\n         And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;\r\n      Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee,\r\n         And live alone in the bee-loud glade.\r\n\r\n      And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,\r\n         Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;\r\n      There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,\r\n         And evening full of the linnets' wings.\r\n\r\nIn this place, and for convenience sake, it may be permitted to speak\r\nof aspects of Yeats's work other than that by virtue of which he is\r\nto be classed with the group we have just considered. In his\r\nnarrative poem, \"The Wanderings of Usheen\", as well as in his plays\r\nand lyrics, he is of the best of those--among them we may mention by\r\nthe way Dr. John Todhunter, Nora Hopper (Mrs. W.H. Chesson), and\r\nWilliam Larminie--who have revealed to our day the strange beauty of\r\nthe ancient creations of the Gaelic imagination. In prose he has\r\nwritten short stories, a novelette, _John Sherman and Dhoya_, and\r\nessays that reveal a subtle critical insight, and a style of\r\nbeautiful finish and grace, suggestive of the style of Shelley's\r\n_Defence of Poetry_. Yeats's plays constitute a considerable and an\r\nimportant part of his work, but these must be reserved for treatment\r\nelsewhere in this book. In prefaces to anthologies of prose and verse\r\nof his editing, in the pages of reviews, and elsewhere, he appears as\r\nthe chief apologist of the aims of the Literary Revival, and in\r\nparticular of the methods of the dramatists of the Revival. Whatever\r\nhe has touched he has lifted into the realm of poetry, and this is in\r\nlarge measure true of his prose, which proceeds from the poet's point\r\nof view and breathes the poetic spirit. A man of rare versatility, a\r\nfinished artist with a scrupulous artistic conscience, he has done\r\nwork of high and sustained quality, and is certain to exert a good\r\nand lasting influence upon the literature of his country.\r\n\r\nIn a literary movement in the \"Isle of Saints\", we look naturally for\r\nreligious poetry, and we do not look in vain. This poetry, chiefly\r\nCatholic, has a quality of its own as distinctive as that of the\r\nwriters of the group we have just left. Now it voices a naïve,\r\ndevoted simplicity of Christian faith; now it attains to a high and\r\nkeen spirituality; now it is mystic and pagan. Among the religious\r\npoets, Lionel Johnson easily stands first--perhaps the Irish poet of\r\nfirmest fibre and most resonant voice of his generation. A note of\r\nhigh courage and of spiritual triumph rings through his verse, even\r\nfrom the shadow of the wings of the dark angel that gives a title to\r\none of the saddest of his poems. Often he strikes a note of genuine\r\nreligious ecstasy and exaltation rarely heard in English, as in \"Te\r\nMartyrum Candidatus\":\r\n\r\n      Ah, see the fair chivalry come, the companions of Christ!\r\n         White Horsemen, who ride on white horses, the Knights of God!\r\n      They, for their Lord and their Lover who sacrificed\r\n         All, save the pleasure of treading where He first trod.\r\n\r\n      These through the darkness of death, the dominion of night,\r\n         Swept, and they woke in white places at morning tide:\r\n      They saw with their eyes, and sang for joy of the sight,\r\n         They saw with their eyes the Eyes of the Crucified.\r\n\r\nAmong the men of the Revival, no personality is stronger or more\r\nattractive than that of G.W. Russell--\"Æ\", as he is always\r\ncalled--who may be regarded as the hero of George Moore's _Hail and\r\nFarewell_, and who alone in that gallery of wonderful pen-portraits\r\nlooks forth with complete amiability. He is a pantheist, a mystic,\r\nand a visionary, with what would seem a literal and living faith in\r\nmany gods, though strongly prepossessed in favor of the ancient\r\ndivinities of the Gael, now long since in exile. Impressive and\r\nstriking by a certain spiritual integrity, so to say, \"Æ\" unites\r\ngifts and faculties seldom combined. He is a poet of rare subtlety, a\r\npainter in whose genius so good a judge as George Moore believed, and\r\na most practical man of affairs, who, as assistant to Sir Horace\r\nPlunkett, held up the latter's hands in his labors on behalf of\r\nco-operative dairies and the like. His poems have their roots in a\r\npantheism which half reveals the secrets of an indwelling spirit,\r\nspeaking alike \"from the dumb brown lips of earth\" and from the\r\npassions of the heart of man.\r\n\r\nOf novelists, both men and women, the Irish Revival can, in the words\r\nof \"Father O'Flynn\", offer a charming variety, and among their novels\r\nand short stories are some books of high quality and not a few in a\r\nhigh degree interesting and entertaining. To Standish O'Grady we turn\r\nfor tales, with a kind of bardic afflatus about them, of the hero age\r\nof legendary Ireland--tales which drew attention to the romantic\r\nCeltic past of myth and saga, and must have been an inspiration to\r\nmore than one writer of the younger generation. In contrast to the\r\nbroad epic sweep and remote romantic backgrounds of O'Grady, are the\r\nstories of Jane Barlow, whose _genre_ pictures of peasant life in the\r\nwest of Ireland, like her poems mentioned above, show how\r\nsympathetically she understands the ways of thinking, feeling, and\r\nacting of her humble compatriots. A like minute and faithful\r\nknowledge is evident in the work of two story-tellers of the north,\r\nSeumas MacManus and Shan Bullock. The former's outlook is humorous\r\nand pathetic. He tells fairy and folk tales well, and is a past\r\nmaster of the dialect and idiom that combine to give his old-wives'\r\nyarns an honest smack of the soil. Let him who doubts it read\r\n_Through the Turf Smoke_ or _Donegal Fairy Stories_. If Shan Bullock\r\nwalks the same fields as Seumas MacManus, he does so with a different\r\nair and with a more definite purpose. Sometimes he turns to the\r\nsquireens, small farmers, or small country gentry, and lays bare the\r\nhardness and narrowness that are a part of their life. Or, again, in\r\npictures whose sadness and gloom are lightened, to be sure, with\r\nhumor or warmed with love, he studies the necessitous life of the\r\npoor. _The Squireen, The Barrys_, and _Irish Pastorals_ are some of\r\nhis representative books.\r\n\r\nIn the novel as in poetry the ladies have worked side by side with\r\ntheir literary brethren. Miss Hermione Templeton, in her _Darby\r\nO'Gill_, and elsewhere, has written pleasantly and gracefully of the\r\nfairies. In a very different vein are the novels of the\r\ncollaborators, Miss Somerville and \"Martin Ross\" (Miss Violet\r\nMartin), over which English and American readers have laughed as\r\nheartily as their own fellow countrymen. _The Experiences of an Irish\r\nR.M._remains, perhaps, their best book. The work of these ladies, be\r\nit said by the way, is in the line of descent from that group of\r\nolder Irish novelists who wrote in the spirit of the devil-may-care\r\ngentry, the novelists from Maxwell to Lover and Lever, who were ever\r\nquesting \"divilment and divarshion,\" and who in their moods of\r\nboisterous fun forgot the real Irishman, and presented in his place a\r\ncaricature--him of the Celtic screech and the exhilarating whack of\r\nthe shillelagh, the famous stage Irishman who has made occasional\r\nappearances in English literature from the time of Shakespeare's\r\n_Henry V._, on through the works of Fielding and the plays of\r\nSheridan, to the present moment of writing.\r\n\r\nOf a very different stripe from the work of the collaborating ladies\r\njust mentioned are the novels of the recently deceased Canon\r\nSheehan--notable among them _Luke Delmege_ and _My New\r\nCurate_--rambling, diffuse, and a trifle provincial from the artistic\r\nstandpoint, but interesting as studies of manners, and for the\r\npictures they afford of the priesthood of modern Ireland in the\r\npleasantest light. If the stories of Miss Somerville and \"Martin\r\nRoss\" are related to the comic stories of the old novelists of the\r\ngentry, those of Canon Sheehan must be associated with the work of\r\nthe older novelists who wrote more or less in the spirit of the\r\npeasantry, that is, with Gerald Griffin, the Banim brothers, and\r\nWilliam Carleton, less famous than he deserves to be by his _Traits\r\nand Stories_ and a long line of novels and tales.\r\n\r\nNo survey of Irish novelists, however brief, can afford to forget the\r\nRev. James Owen Hannay (\"George A. Birmingham\"), canon of St.\r\nPatrick's Cathedral, Dublin, whose work is as distinctively\r\nProtestant in its point of view as Father Sheehan's is Catholic. His\r\nmore substantial novels are a careful transcript of the actualities\r\nof Irish life today, and in them one meets, incognito but easily\r\nrecognizable, many Irishmen now prominent in literature or politics\r\nin Ireland. Of his numerous books may be mentioned _The Seething Pot,\r\nHyacinth_, and _Northern Iron_.\r\n\r\nFinally there is George Moore, whose enlistment in the Revival was\r\nresponsible for the novel _The Lake_ and the short stories of _The\r\nUnfilled Field_, and for a largely autobiographic and entirely\r\nindiscreet trilogy entitled _Hail and Farewell_, the separate volumes\r\nappearing as _Ave, Salve, Vale_, and the last of them as late as\r\n1914. George Moore's anti-Catholic bias is strong, but his is the pen\r\nof an accomplished artist. He has the story-teller's beguiling gift,\r\nand he bristles with ideas which his books cleverly embody and to\r\nwhich the dramatic moments of his novels give point and relief.\r\n\r\nNot the least important work of the Irish Literary Revival has been\r\ndone by translators, who have put into English the old Gaelic\r\nromances and the folklore still current among the little remnant of\r\nIrish-speaking country folk. Dr. Douglas Hyde is in the forefront of\r\nthis group. He it was who organized the Gaelic League, a band of\r\nenthusiasts zealous for the revival of the Irish language both as a\r\nspoken tongue and as the medium for a national literature, and eager,\r\nalso, to breed up a race of Celtic scholars. The lyrics in his _Love\r\nSongs of Connacht_ are full of grace, tenderness, and fire, and\r\nindicate the kind of gems which he and his fellow laborers have added\r\nto the treasury of poetry in English. But it is Lady Gregory,\r\nespecially in her _Cuchulain of Muirthemne_ and _Gods and Fighting\r\nMen_, who more than any other has found a way to stir the blood of\r\nreaders of to-day by the romantic hero tales of Ireland. From the\r\nracy idiom of the dwellers on or about her own estate in Galway, she\r\nhappily framed a style that gave her narratives freshness, novelty,\r\nand a flavor of the soil. Upon the work of scholars she drew heavily\r\nin making her own renderings, but she has justified all borrowings by\r\nbreathing into her books the breath and the warmth of life, and her\r\nadaptation to epic purposes of the dialect of those who still retain\r\nthe expiring habit of thinking in Gaelic was a real literary\r\nachievement. She has, indeed, in sins of commission and of omission,\r\ntaken liberties with the old legends, but this may render them not\r\nless, and perhaps more, delightful to the general reader, however\r\njust complaints may be from the standpoint of the scholar.\r\n\r\nEven so brief a sketch as this may suffice to bring home to those not\r\nalready aware of it a realization of the delights to be drawn from\r\nthe creations of a living literary movement, which is perhaps the\r\nmost notable of its generation, and which has gathered together a\r\nremarkable group of poets, novelists, and dramatists, who, as men and\r\nwomen, are a most interesting company--a fact to which even George\r\nMoore's _Hail and Farewell_, with its quick eye for defects and\r\nfoibles and its ironic wit, bears abundant testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nBrooke and Rolleston: Treasury of Irish Poetry (New York and London,\r\n1900); Krans: William Butler Yeats and the Irish Literary Revival\r\n(New York and London, 1904); Yeats: Ideas of Good and Evil (London,\r\n1903); Moore: Hail and Farewell, 3 vols.

LENNOX, B.A., Litt.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic literature of Ireland is not only of wonderful volume and\r\npriceless worth, but is also of great antiquity, whereas the English\r\nliterature of Ireland, while also of considerable extent and high\r\nvalue, is of comparatively modern origin. The explanation of this\r\nfact is that for more than six centuries after the Anglo-Norman\r\ninvasion of 1169 the Irish language continued to be both the spoken\r\nand, with Latin, the written organ of the great mass of the Irish\r\npeople, and that for nearly the whole of that period those English\r\nsettlers who did not become, as the well-known phrase has it, more\r\nIrish than the Irish themselves by adopting the native language,\r\ncustoms, and sentiments, were kept too busy in holding, defending,\r\nand extending their territory to devote themselves to literary\r\npursuits. Hence we need not wonder if, leaving out of account merely\r\ntechnical works like Lionel Power's treatise on music, written in\r\n1395, we find that the English literature of Ireland takes its\r\ncomparatively humble origin late in the sixteenth century. For more\r\nthan two centuries thereafter, owing to the fact that the native\r\nIrish, because they were Catholics, were debarred by law from an\r\neducation, the writing of English remained almost exclusively in the\r\nhands of members or descendants of the Anglo-Irish colony, who, with\r\nscarcely an exception, were Protestants and had as their principal\r\nIrish seat of learning the then essentially Protestant institution,\r\nTrinity College, Dublin. Alien in race and creed though these writers\r\nmainly were, they have nevertheless spread a halo of glory around\r\ntheir adopted country, and have won the admiration, and often the\r\naffection, of Irishmen of every shade of religious and political\r\nbelief. For example, there is no Irishman who is not proud of\r\nMolyneux and Swift, of Goldsmith and Burke, of Grattan and Sheridan.\r\nFrom the nineteenth century onward Irish Catholics have taken their\r\nfull share in the production of English literature. Here, however, it\r\nwill be necessary to consider the writers of none but the sixteenth,\r\nseventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, as in other pages of this\r\nvolume considerable attention has been given to those of later date.\r\n\r\nI. SIXTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nRichard Stanyhurst (1547-1618), born in Dublin but educated at\r\nOxford, is the first representative of the sixteenth century with\r\nwhom we are called upon to deal. He belonged to a family long settled\r\nin or near Dublin and of some note in municipal annals. Under the\r\ndirection of the Jesuit martyr, Edmund Campion, Stanyhurst wrote a\r\n_Description_, as well as a portion of the _History_, of Ireland for\r\nHolinshed's _Chronicles_, published in 1577. He also translated\r\n(1582) the first four books of _Virgil his Aeneis_ into quantitative\r\nhexameters, on the unsound pedantic principles which Gabriel Harvey\r\nwas at that time trying so hard to establish in English prosody; but\r\nthe experiment, which turned out so badly in the master's hands,\r\nfared even worse in those of the disciple, and Stanyhurst's lines\r\nwill always stand as a noted specimen of inept translation and\r\nridiculous versification. Equally inartistic was his version of some\r\nof the Psalms in the same metre. In Latin he wrote a profound\r\ncommentary on Porphyry, the Neo-Platonic mystic. Stanyhurst, who was\r\nuncle to James Ussher, the celebrated Protestant archbishop of\r\nArmagh, was himself a convert to Catholicity, and on the death of his\r\nsecond wife became a priest and wrote in Latin some edifying books of\r\ndevotion. Two of his sons joined the Jesuit order. He died at\r\nBrussels in 1618. Stanyhurst viewed Ireland entirely from the English\r\nstandpoint, and in his _Description_ and _History_ is, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, greatly biased against the native race.\r\n\r\nIf we may take it as certain that modern investigation is correct in\r\nasserting that Thomas Campion was a native of Dublin, a notable\r\naddition will have been made to the ranks of Irish-born writers of\r\nEnglish at this period. Thomas Campion (1567-1620), wherever born,\r\nspent most of his life in London. He was a versatile genius, for,\r\nafter studying law, he took up medicine, and, although practising as\r\na physician, he yet found time to write four masques and many lyrics\r\nand to compose a goodly quantity of music. Some of his songs appeared\r\nas early as 1591. Among his works is a treatise entitled\r\n_Observations in the Art of English Poesie_ (1602), in which, strange\r\nto say, he, a born lyrist, advocated unrhymed verse and quantitative\r\nmeasures, but fortunately his practice did not usually square with\r\nhis theory. His masques were written for occasions, such as the\r\nmarriage of Lord Hayes (1607), the nuptials of the Princess Elizabeth\r\nand the Elector Palatine (1613), and the ill-starred wedding of\r\nSomerset and the quondam Countess of Essex in the same year. In these\r\nmasques are embedded some of his best songs; others of his lyrics\r\nappeared in several _Bookes of Ayres_ between 1601 and 1617. Many of\r\nthem were written to music, sometimes music of his composing. Such\r\ndainty things as \"Now hath Flora robb'd her bowers\" and \"Harke, all\r\nyou ladies that do sleep\" possess the charms of freshness and\r\nspontaneity, and his devotional poetry, especially \"Awake, awake,\r\nthou heavy Spright\" and \"Never weather-beaten Saile more willing bent\r\nto shore\", makes almost as wide an appeal.\r\n\r\nII. SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nPassing by with regret the illustrious seventeenth century names of\r\nPhilip O'Sullivan Beare, Sir James Ware, Luke Wadding, Hugh Ward,\r\nJohn Colgan, and John Lynch, because their bearers wrote in Latin,\r\nand those of \"The Four Masters\" and Geoffrey Keating, because they\r\nwrote in Irish, we are first brought to a pause in the seventeenth\r\ncentury by the imposing figure of him, whom, in a later day, Johnson\r\njustly called the \"great luminary of the Irish [Protestant] church\",\r\nnone other than the archbishop of Armagh and primate of Ireland,\r\nJames Ussher himself. James Ussher (1581-1656), born in Dublin and\r\namong the earliest students of the newly-founded Trinity College, was\r\nin intellect and scholarship one of the greatest men that Ireland has\r\never produced. Selden describes him as \"learned to a miracle\" (_ad\r\nmiraculum doctus_), and Canon D'Alton in his _History of Ireland_\r\nsays of him that \"he was not unworthy to rank even with Duns Scotus,\r\nand when he died he left in his own Church neither an equal nor a\r\nsecond.\" Declining the high office of provost of Trinity, Ussher was\r\nmade bishop of Meath and was afterwards promoted to the primatial\r\nsee. His fine intellect was unfortunately marred by narrow religious\r\nviews, and in many ways he displayed his animus against those of his\r\ncountrymen who did not see eye to eye with him in matters of faith\r\nand doctrine. For example, it was he who in 1626 drew up the Irish\r\nProtestant bishops' protest against toleration for Catholics, therein\r\nshowing a bigotry which consorted badly with his reputation as a\r\nscholar. On account of his well-known attitude towards Catholicism,\r\nhe was naturally unpopular with those who professed the ancient\r\ncreed, and hence, when the rebellion of 1641 broke out, much of his\r\nproperty was destroyed by the enraged insurgents. His person escaped\r\nviolence, for he happened to be in England at the time engaged in the\r\nvain task of trying to effect an accommodation between Charles I. and\r\nthe English parliament. He never returned to his see and died in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nUssher's collected works fill seventeen stately volumes. His _magnum\r\nopus_ is undoubtedly the _Annales Veteris et Novi Testamenti_. It is\r\nwritten in Latin, and is a chronological compendium of the history of\r\nthe world from the Creation to the dispersion of the Jews under\r\nVespasian. Published at Leyden, London, Paris, and Oxford, it gained\r\nfor its author a European fame. His books written in English deal\r\nmostly with theological or controversial subjects, and while they\r\ndisplay wide reading, great acumen, and keen powers of argumentation,\r\nthey yet do not do full justice to his genius. Those which he\r\npublished in Dublin are _A Discourse of the Religion anciently\r\nprofessed by the Irish and British_ (1622), in which he tried to show\r\nthat the ritual and discipline of the Church as originally\r\nestablished in the British Isles were in agreement with the Church of\r\nEngland and opposed to the Catholic Church on the matters in dispute\r\nbetween them; _An Answer to a Challenge made by a Jesuite in Ireland_\r\n(1624), in which his aim was to disprove the contention set forth\r\nearlier in the same year by a Jesuit that uniformity of doctrine had\r\nalways been maintained by the Catholic Church; and _Immanuel, or the\r\nMysterie of the Incarnation_. He published in England _The Originall\r\nof Bishops, A Body of Divinitie, The Principles of Christian\r\nReligion_, and other works. So great was Ussher's reputation that\r\nwhen he died Cromwell relaxed in his favor one of the strictest laws\r\nof the Puritans and allowed him to be buried with the full service of\r\nthe Church of England, and with great pomp, in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nAmong Ussher's other claims to distinction, it should be noted that\r\nit was he who in 1621 discovered the celebrated Book of Kells, which\r\nhad long been lost. This marvel of the illuminator's art passed with\r\nthe remainder of his collection of books and manuscripts to Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, in 1661, and to this day it remains one of the most\r\ntreasured possessions of the noble library of that institution.\r\n\r\nSir John Denham (1615-1669), a Dublin man by birth, took an active\r\npart on the side of Charles I. against the parliament during the\r\nCivil War, and subsequently was conspicuous in the intrigues that led\r\nto the restoration of Charles II. In his own day he had a great\r\nreputation as a poet. His tragedy, _The Sophy_, and his translation\r\nof the Psalms are now forgotten, but he is still remembered for one\r\npiece, _Cooper's Hill_, in which occur the well-known lines addressed\r\nto the River Thames:\r\n\r\n      O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream\r\n      My great example, as it is my theme!\r\n      Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull;\r\n      Strong, without rage; without o'erflowing, full.\r\n\r\nAnother Dublin-born man was Wentworth Dillon, Earl of Roscommon\r\n(1633-1684). He had the good fortune to win encomiums both from\r\nDryden and from Pope. One of his merits, as pointed out by the\r\nlatter, is that\r\n\r\n                      In all Charles's days\r\n      Roscommon only boasts unspotted bays.\r\n\r\nHe translated from Virgil, Lucan, Horace, and Guarini; wrote\r\nprologues, epilogues, and other occasional verses; but is now\r\nprincipally remembered for his poetical _Essay on Translated Verse_\r\n(1681), in which he develops principles previously laid down by\r\nCowley and Denham. To his credit be it said, he condemns indecency,\r\nboth as want of sense and bad taste. He was honored with a funeral in\r\nWestminster Abbey. Johnson records that, at the moment of his death,\r\nRoscommon uttered with great energy and devotion the following two\r\nlines from his own translation of the _Dies Irae_:\r\n\r\n      My God, my Father, and my Friend,\r\n      Do not forsake me in my end!\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle (1627-1691), one of the founders of the Royal Society\r\n(1662), was son of the \"great\" Earl of Cork and was born at Lismore,\r\nCo. Waterford. He takes rank among the principal experimental\r\nphilosophers of his age, and he certainly rendered valuable services\r\nto the advancement of science. Most of his writings, which are very\r\nvoluminous, are naturally of a technical character and therefore do\r\nnot properly belong to literature; but his _Occasional Reflections on\r\nSeveral Subjects_ (1665), a strange mixture of triviality and\r\nseriousness, was germinal in this sense that it led to two celebrated\r\n_jeux d'esprit_, namely, Butler's _Occasional Reflection on Dr.\r\nCharlton's feeling a Dog's Pulse at Gresham College_ and Swift's\r\n_Pious Meditation upon a Broomstick, in the Style of the Honourable\r\nMr. Boyle_. Indeed, one of Boyle's _Reflections_, that \"Upon the\r\nEating of Oysters\", is reputed to have rendered a still more signal\r\nservice to literature, for in its two concluding paragraphs is\r\ncontained the idea which, under the transforming hand of the master\r\nsatirist, eventually took the world by storm when it appeared, fully\r\ndeveloped, as _Gulliver's Travels_.\r\n\r\nHis brother, Roger Boyle (1621-1679), who figures largely as a\r\nsoldier and a statesman in Irish and English history under his title\r\nof Lord Broghill, was an alumnus of Trinity College, Dublin. During\r\nthe Civil War he was a royalist until the death of Charles I., when\r\nhe changed sides and aided Cromwell materially in his Irish campaign.\r\nWhen the Lord Protector died, Broghill made another right-about-face,\r\nand crossing to his native country worked so energetically and\r\nsuccessfully that he made Ireland solid for the restoration of\r\nCharles II. For this service he was rewarded by being created Earl of\r\nOrrery. He was the author of six tragedies and two comedies, some of\r\nwhich when produced proved gratifyingly popular. He is noted for\r\nhaving been the first to write tragedy in rhyme, thereby setting an\r\nexample that was followed with avidity for a time by Dryden and\r\nothers. He also wrote poems, a romance called _Parthenissa_ (1654),\r\nand a _Treatise on the Art of War_ (1677). From whatever point of\r\nview considered, Lord Orrery was a remarkable member of a remarkable\r\nfamily. His son, John Boyle, Earl of Cork and Orrery (1707-1762), in\r\nvirtue of his translation of Pliny's _Letters_, his _Remarks on the\r\nLife and Writings of Swift_, and his _Letters from Italy_, has some\r\nclaims to recognition in the field of literature.\r\n\r\nCharles Leslie (1650-1722), a Dubliner by birth, was son of that John\r\nLeslie, bishop of Raphoe and Clogher, who lived through a whole\r\ncentury, from 1571 to 1671, and who was 79 years of age when Charles,\r\nhis sixth son, was born. Educated first at Enniskillen and afterwards\r\nat Trinity College, Dublin, Charles Leslie studied law in London, but\r\neventually abandoned that profession and entered the ministry. He was\r\nof a disputatious character and in particular went to great lengths\r\nin opposing the pro-Catholic activities of James II. Nevertheless,\r\nwhen the Revolution of 1688 came, he took the side of the deposed\r\nmonarch, and loyally adhered to his Jacobite principles for the\r\nremainder of his life. He even joined the Old Pretender on the\r\ncontinent, and endeavored to convert him to Protestantism, but,\r\nfailing therein, he returned to Ireland, where he died at Glasslough\r\nin county Monaghan. Many years of Leslie's life were devoted to\r\ndisputes with Catholics, Quakers, Socinians, and Deists, and the\r\nseven volumes which his writings fill prove that he was an extremely\r\nable controversialist. His best known work is the famous treatise, _A\r\nShort and Easy Method with the Deists_, published in 1698.\r\n\r\nThe Irish note, tone, or temper is not conspicuous in any of the\r\nwritings so far named unless when it is conspicuous by its absence;\r\nbut it appears plainly, for the first time, in Molyneux's _Case of\r\nIreland being bound by Laws [made] in England Stated_ (1698). William\r\nMolyneux (1656-1698) has always ranked as an Irish patriot. His was\r\none of the spirits invoked by Grattan in his great speech (1782) on\r\nthe occasion on which he carried his celebrated Declaration of\r\nIndependence in the Irish parliament. When the English Act of 1698,\r\nwhich was meant to destroy, and did destroy, the Irish woolen\r\nindustry, came before the Irish house of commons for ratification,\r\nMolyneux's was the only voice raised against its adoption. His\r\nprotest was followed by the publication of his _Case Stated_, which\r\nis a classic on the general relations between Ireland and England,\r\nand contained arguments so irrefutable that it drove the English\r\nparliament to fury and was by that body ordered to be burned by the\r\ncommon hangman. It is a remarkable coincidence that Molyneux opens\r\nhis argument by laying down in almost identical words the principles\r\nwhich stand at the beginning of the American Declaration of\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nJohn Toland (1669-1722) was born near Redcastle, in Co. Derry, and\r\nwas at first a Catholic but subsequently became a free-thinker. His\r\n_Christianity not Mysterious_ (1696) marks an epoch in religious\r\ndisputes, for it started the deistical controversy which was so\r\ndistinctive a feature of the first half of the eighteenth century. It\r\nshared a similar fate to that of the _Case Stated_, though on very\r\ndifferent grounds, and was ordered by the Irish parliament to be\r\nburned by the hangman. Toland wrote many other books, among which are\r\n_Amyntor_ (1699); _Nazarenus_ (1702); _Pantheisticon; History of the\r\nDruids_; and _Hypatia_. All his books show versatility and wide\r\nreading and are characterized by a pointed, vigorous, and aggressive\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nGeorge Farquhar (1678-1707), a Derry man, and Thomas Southerne\r\n(1660-1746), born near Dublin, were distinguished playwrights, who\r\nbegan their respective careers in the seventeenth century. Farquhar\r\nleft Trinity College, Dublin, as an undergraduate and became an\r\nactor, but owing to his accidental killing of another player he left\r\nthe stage and secured a commission in the army. He soon turned his\r\nattention to the writing of plays, and was responsible in all for\r\neight comedies. He has left us some characters that are very humorous\r\nand at the same time true to life, such as Scrub the servant in _The\r\nBeaux' Stratagem_ and Sergeant Kite in _The Recruiting Officer_. His\r\nBoniface, the landlord in the former of these two plays, has become\r\nthe type, as well as the ordinary quasi-facetious nickname, of an\r\ninnkeeper. He was advancing in his art, for his last comedy, _The\r\nBeaux' Stratagem_ (1707), is undoubtedly his best, and had he lived\r\nlonger--he died before he was thirty--he might have bequeathed to\r\nposterity something even more noteworthy. As Leigh Hunt says of him:\r\n\"He was becoming gayer and gayer, when death, in the shape of a sore\r\nanxiety, called him away as if from a pleasant party, and left the\r\nhouse ringing with his jest.\"\r\n\r\nSoutherne was also a student of Trinity College, Dublin. At the age\r\nof eighteen, however, he left his _alma mater_, and went to London to\r\nstudy law. This profession he in turn abandoned for the drama. His\r\nfirst play, _The Persian Prince, or the Loyal Brother_, had\r\nremarkable success when performed, and secured him an ensign's\r\ncommission in the army (1685). Here promotion came to him rapidly and\r\nby 1688 he had risen to captain's rank. The Revolution of that year,\r\nhowever, cut off all further hope of advancement, and he once more\r\nturned his attention to the writing of plays. His productions number\r\nten. His tragedies _Isabella, or the Fatal Marriage_ (1694) and\r\n_Oroonoko_ (1696), both founded on tales by Mrs. Aphra Behn, are\r\npowerful presentations of human suffering. His comedies are amusing,\r\nbut gross. Southerne had business ability enough to make play-writing\r\npay, and the amounts he received for his productions fairly staggered\r\nhis friend Dryden. It is to this faculty that Pope alludes when he\r\nsays that Southerne was one whom\r\n\r\n                 heaven sent down to raise\r\n      The price of prologues and of plays.\r\n\r\nHe was apparently of amiable and estimable character, for he secured\r\nand retained the friendship not only of Dryden--a comparatively easy\r\nmatter--but also that of Pope, a much more difficult task. Known as\r\n\"the poets' Nestor\", Southerne spent his declining years in peaceful\r\nretirement and in the enjoyment of the fortune which he had amassed\r\nby his pen.\r\n\r\nNahum Tate (1652-1715), a Dubliner by birth, and Nicholas Brady\r\n(1659-1726), a Bandon man, have secured a certain sort of twin\r\nimmortality by their authorized metrical version of the Psalms\r\n(1696), which gradually took the place of the older rendering by\r\nSternhold and Hopkins. Tate became poet-laureate in 1690 in\r\nsuccession to Shadwell and was appointed historiographer-royal in\r\n1702. He wrote the bulk of the second part of _Absalom and\r\nAchitophel_ with a wonderfully close imitation of Dryden's manner,\r\nbesides several dramatic pieces and poems. Between Tate, Shadwell,\r\nEusden, and Pye lies the unenviable distinction of being the worst of\r\nthe laureates of England. Brady was a clergyman who, after the\r\npleasant fashion of that day, was a pluralist on a small scale, for\r\nhe had the living of Richmond for thirty years from 1696, and while\r\nholding that held also in succession the livings of Stratford-on-Avon\r\nand Clapham. He added further to his income, and doubtless to his\r\nanxieties, by keeping a school at Richmond. He wrote a tragedy\r\nentitled _The Rape_, a _History of the Goths and Vandals_, a\r\ntranslation of the _Aeneid_ into blank verse, and an _Ode for St.\r\nCecilia's Day_; but, unless for his share in the version of the\r\nPsalms, his literary reputation is well nigh as dead as the dodo.\r\n\r\nIreland somewhat doubtfully claims to have given birth to Mrs.\r\nSusannah Centlivre (c. 1667-1723), who, after a rather wild youth,\r\nsettled down to literary pursuits and domestic contentment when, in\r\n1706, she married Queen Anne's head-cook, Joseph Centlivre, with whom\r\nshe lived happily ever after. Her first play, _The Provoked Husband_,\r\na tragedy, was produced in 1700, and then she went on the stage as an\r\nactress. She wrote in all nineteen dramatic pieces, some of which had\r\nthe honor of being translated into French and German. Her most\r\noriginal play was _A Bold Stroke for a Wife_ (1717).\r\n\r\nIII. EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nWe have now fairly crossed the border of the eighteenth century, and,\r\nas we met Ussher early in the seventeenth, so we are here confronted\r\nwith the colossal intellect and impressive personality of Swift, one\r\nof the greatest, most peculiar, and most original geniuses to be\r\nfound in the whole domain of English literature. Jonathan Swift\r\n(1667-1745), born in Dublin, was educated at Trinity College, where\r\nhe succeeded in graduating only by special favor. After some years\r\nspent in the household of Sir William Temple in England, he entered\r\nthe ministry of the Irish Church. During the early years of the\r\ncentury he spent much time in London, and took an active part in\r\nbringing about that political revolution which seated the Tories\r\nfirmly in power during the last four years of the reign of Queen\r\nAnne. His services in that connection on the _Examiner_ newspaper\r\nwere so great that it would be difficult to dispute the assertion,\r\nwhich has been made, that he was one of the mightiest journalists\r\nthat ever wielded a pen. He also stood loyally by his party in his\r\ngreat pamphlets, _The Conduct of the Allies_ (1711), _The Barrier\r\nTreaty_ (1712), and _The Public Spirit of the Whigs_ (1714). When the\r\ntime came for his reward, he received not, as he had hoped, an\r\nEnglish bishopric, but the deanery of St. Patrick's in Dublin. On\r\nresuming his residence in Ireland he was at first very unpopular, but\r\nhis patriotic spirit as shown in the _Drapier Letters_ (1723-1724),\r\nwritten in connection with a coinage scheme known as \"Wood's\r\nhalfpence\", not only caused the withdrawal of the obnoxious project\r\nbut also made Swift the idol of all classes of his countrymen. In\r\nmany others of his writings he showed that pro-Irish leaning which\r\ncaused Grattan to invoke his spirit along with that of Molyneux on\r\nthe occasion already referred to. Nothing more mordant than the irony\r\ncontained in his _Modest Proposal_ has ever been penned. In his plea\r\nfor native manufactures he struck a keynote that has vibrated down\r\nthe ages when he advised Irishmen to burn everything English except\r\ncoal!\r\n\r\nSwift's greater works are _The Battle of the Books_, his contribution\r\nto the controversy concerning the relative merits of the ancients and\r\nthe moderns; the _Tale of a Tub_, in which he attacked the three\r\nleading forms of Christianity; and, above all, _Gulliver's Travels_.\r\nIn this last work he let loose the full flood of his merciless satire\r\nand lashed the folly and vices of mankind in the most unsparing way.\r\nHe also wrote verses which are highly characteristic and some of them\r\nnot without considerable merit. His life was unhappy and for the last\r\nfive years of it he was to all intents and purposes insane. His\r\nrelations with Stella (Hester Johnson) and Vanessa (Esther\r\nVanhomrigh) have never been quite satisfactorily explained. The\r\nweight of evidence would seem to show that he was secretly married to\r\nStella, but that they never lived together as husband and wife. Many\r\nnovels and plays have been written round those entanglements. He lies\r\nburied in his own cathedral, St. Patrick's, Dublin, and beside him\r\nlies Stella. Over his tomb there is an epitaph in Latin, written by\r\nhimself, in which, after speaking of the _saeva indignatio_ which\r\ntore his heart, he bids the wayfarer go and imitate, if he can, the\r\nenergetic defender of his native land.\r\n\r\nContemporary with the Dean there was another Anglo-Irishman, who\r\nfills a large space in the history of English literature, and of whom\r\nhis countrymen are justly proud. Sir Richard Steele (1672-1729), who\r\nwas born in Dublin and educated at the Charterhouse in London and\r\nafterwards at Oxford, started the _Tatler_ in 1709, and thereby\r\npopularized, though he did not exactly originate, the periodical\r\nessay. Aided by his friend, Addison, he carried the work to\r\nperfection in the _Spectator_ (1711-1712) and the _Guardian_ (1713).\r\nSince then these essays have enlightened and amused each succeeding\r\ngeneration. Of the two, Addison's is the greater name, but Steele was\r\nthe more innovating spirit, for it is to him, and not to Addison,\r\nthat the conception and initiation of the plan of the celebrated\r\npapers is due. Steele had had a predecessor in Defoe, whose _Review_\r\nhad been in existence since 1704, but the more airy graces which\r\ncharacterized the _Tatler_ and the _Spectator_ gave the\r\n\"lucubrations\" of \"Isaac Bickerstaffe\" and of \"Mr. Spectator\" a\r\ngreater hold on the public than Defoe's paper was ever able to\r\nestablish. Steele was responsible for many more periodicals, such as\r\nthe _Englishman_, the _Lover_, the _Reader_, _Town Talk_, the\r\n_Tea-Table, Chit-Chat_, the _Plebeian_, and the _Theatre_, most of\r\nwhich had a rather ephemeral existence. Among his other services to\r\nliterature he helped to purify the stage of some of its grossness,\r\nand he became the founder of that sentimental comedy which in the\r\ndays of the early Georges took the place of the immoral comedy of the\r\nRestoration period, when, in Johnson's famous phrase,\r\n\r\n      Intrigue was plot, obscenity was wit.\r\n\r\nSteele's four comedies are _The Funeral; or Grief à la mode_ (1701);\r\n_The Lying Lover_ (1703); _The Tender Husband_ (1705); and _The\r\nConscious Lovers_ (1722). Although he held various lucrative offices,\r\nSteele was never really prosperous and was frequently in debt; like\r\nmost of the contemporary Englishmen with whom his lot was thrown, he\r\nwas rather addicted to the bottle; but, on the whole, it may fairly\r\nbe advanced that unnecessary stress has been laid on these aspects of\r\nhis life by Macaulay, Thackeray, and others. After a chequered\r\ncareer, he died near Carmarthen, in Wales, on September 1, 1729.\r\n\r\nMember of a family and bearer of a name destined to secure immense\r\nfame in later Irish history, Thomas Parnell (1679-1718) was born in\r\nDublin and educated at Trinity College. Entering the ministry in\r\n1700, he was rapidly promoted to be archdeacon of Clogher and some\r\nyears later was made rector of Finglas. An accomplished scholar and a\r\ndelightful companion, he was one of the original members of the\r\nfamous Scriblerus Club and wrote or helped to write several of its\r\npapers, he contributed to the _Spectator_ and the _Guardian_, and he\r\nrendered sterling assistance to Pope in the translation of Homer. As\r\nwill be inferred, he spent much of his time in England, and on one of\r\nhis journeys to Ireland he died in his thirty-ninth year at Chester,\r\nwhere he was buried. He wrote a great deal of verse--songs, hymns,\r\nepistles, eclogues, translations, tales, and occasional trifles; but\r\nthree poems, _A Hymn to Contentment_, which is fanciful and\r\nmelodious, _A Night-piece on Death_, in which inquisitorial research\r\nseems to have found the first faint dawn of Romanticism, and _The\r\nHermit_, which has been not inaptly styled \"the apex and _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_ of Augustan poetry in England\", constitute his chief claim\r\nto present remembrance.\r\n\r\nFrancis Hutcheson (1694-1746), the son of a Presbyterian minister,\r\nwas born at Armagh, and studied at Glasgow University. He opened in\r\nDublin a private academy, which succeeded beyond expectation. The\r\npublication of his _Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty\r\nand Virtue_ (1720) and his _Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the\r\nPassions_ (1728) brought him great fame, and in 1729 he was elected\r\nto the professorship of moral philosophy in the University of\r\nGlasgow. Others of his works are a treatise on _Logic_ and _A System\r\nof Moral Philosophy_, the latter not published till 1755, nine years\r\nafter his death. Hutcheson fills a large space in the history of\r\nphilosophy, both as a metaphysician and as a moralist. He is in some\r\nrespects a pioneer of the \"Scotch school\" and of \"common sense\"\r\nphilosophy. He greatly developed the doctrine of \"moral sense\", a\r\nterm first used by the third Earl of Shaftesbury; indeed, much of his\r\nwhole moral system may be traced to Shaftesbury. Hutcheson's\r\ninfluence was widely felt: it is plainly perceptible in Hume, Adam\r\nSmith, and Reid. He was greater as a speaker even than as a writer,\r\nand his lectures evoked much enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nGeorge Berkeley (1685-1753), bishop of Cloyne, was born at Dysert\r\nCastle, near Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny, and was educated first at\r\nKilkenny school and afterwards at Trinity College, Dublin. Having\r\ntaken Anglican orders, he visited London, where he wrote nine papers\r\nfor the _Guardian_ and was admitted to the companionship and\r\nfriendship of the leading literary men of the age--Swift, Pope,\r\nAddison, Steele, and Arbuthnot. This connection proved of great\r\nassistance to him, for Pope not only celebrated him as possessing\r\n\"every virtue under heaven\", but also recommended him to the Duke of\r\nGrafton, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, who appointed him his chaplain\r\nand subsequently obtained for him the deanery of Derry. In\r\nfurtherance of a great scheme for \"converting the savage Americans to\r\nChristianity\", Berkeley and some friends, armed with a royal charter,\r\ncame to this country, landing at Newport in Rhode Island in January,\r\n1729. All went well for a while: Berkeley bought a farm and built a\r\nhouse; but when the hard-hearted prime minister refused to forward\r\nthe £20,000 which had been promised, the project came to an end, and\r\nBerkeley returned to London in February, 1732. In 1734 he was\r\nappointed bishop of Cloyne, and later refused the see of Clogher,\r\nthough its income was fully double that of his own diocese. In 1752\r\nhe resigned his bishopric and settled at Oxford, where he died in\r\n1753.\r\n\r\nBerkeley's works are very numerous. His _Essay towards a New Theory\r\nof Vision_ (1709), which was long regarded in the light of a\r\nphilosophical romance, in reality contains speculations which have\r\nbeen incorporated in modern scientific optics. In his _Three\r\nDialogues between Hylas and Philonous_ (1713) he sets forth his\r\nfamous demonstration of the immateriality of the external world, of\r\nthe spiritual nature of the soul, and of the all-ruling and direct\r\nprovidence of God. His tenets on immateriality have always been\r\nrejected by \"common-sense\" philosophers; but it should be remembered\r\nthat the whole work was written at a time when the English-speaking\r\nworld was disturbed by the theories of sceptics and deists, whose\r\ndoctrines the pious divine sought as best he could to confute. In\r\n1732 appeared his _Alciphron, or the Minute Philosopher_, in which,\r\ndialogue-wise, he presents nature from a religious point of view and\r\nin particular gives many pleasing pictures of American scenery and\r\nlife. These dialogues have frequently been compared to the dialogues\r\nof Plato. To Berkeley's credit be it said that while he ruled in\r\nCloyne he devoted much thought to the amelioration of conditions in\r\nhis native land. Many acute suggestions in that direction are found\r\nin the _Querist_ (1735-1737). By some extraordinary ratiocinative\r\nprocess he convinced himself that tar-water was a panacea for human\r\nills, and in 1744 he set forth his views on that subject in the tract\r\ncalled _Siris_, and returned to the charge in 1752 in his _Further\r\nThoughts on Tar-Water_. Whatever may be thought of the value of\r\nBerkeley's philosophical or practical speculations, there is only one\r\nopinion of his style. It is distinguished by lucidity, ease, and\r\ncharm; it has the saving grace of humor; and it is shot through with\r\nimagination. Taken all in all, this eighteenth century bishop is a\r\nnotable figure in literary annals.\r\n\r\nCharles Macklin (c. 1697-1797), whose real name was MacLaughlin, was\r\na Westmeath man, who took to the stage in early life and remained on\r\nthe boards with considerable and undiminished reputation for some\r\nseventy years, not retiring until 1789 when he was at least 92 years\r\nold. To him we are indebted for what is now the accepted presentation\r\nof the character of Shylock in _The Merchant of Venice_. He wrote a\r\ntragedy and many comedies and farces: those by which he is now best\r\nremembered are the farce, _Love-à-la-Mode_ (1760), and his\r\nmasterpiece, the farcical comedy, _The Man of the World_ (1764). In\r\nSir Pertinax MacSycophant, Macklin has given us one of the\r\ntraditional burlesque characters of the English stage.\r\n\r\nThomas Amory (1691?-1788), if not born in Ireland, was at least of\r\nIrish descent and was educated in Dublin. He is known in literature\r\nfor two books. The first, with the very mixed title of _Memoirs\r\ncontaining the Lives of several Ladies of Great Britain; A History of\r\nAntiquities; Observations on the Christian Religion_, was published\r\nin 1755, and the second, _The Life of John Buncle, Esq._, came out in\r\ntwo volumes in 1756-1766. It appears to have been the author's aim in\r\nboth works to give us a hotch-potch in which he discourses _de\r\nomnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis_. We have dissertations on the cause\r\nof earthquakes and of muscular motion, on the Athanasian Creed, on\r\nfluxions, on phlogiston, on the physical cause of the Deluge, on\r\nIrish literature, on the origin of language, on the evidences for\r\nChristianity, and on all other sorts of unrelated topics. Hazlitt\r\nthought that the soul of Rabelais had passed into Amory, while a more\r\nrecent critic can see in his long-winded discussions naught but the\r\n\"light-headed ramblings of delirium.\" If we try to read _John Buncle_\r\nconsecutively, the result is boredom; but if we open the book at\r\nrandom, we are pretty sure to be interested and even sometimes\r\nagreeably entertained.\r\n\r\nThe bizarre figure of Laurence Sterne (1713-1768) next claims our\r\nattention. The son of a captain in the British army, he was born at\r\nClonmel, Co. Tipperary. Of him almost more than of any of the writers\r\nso far dealt with, it may be said that he was Irish only by the\r\naccident of birth. His parents were English on both sides, and\r\npractically the whole life of their son was spent out of Ireland. He\r\nwas sent to school at Halifax, in Yorkshire, and thence went to\r\nCambridge University, where he graduated in due season. Taking\r\nAnglican orders in 1738, he was immediately appointed to the benefice\r\nof Sutton-in-the-Forest, near York, and on his marriage in 1741 with\r\nElizabeth Lumley he received the additional living of Stillington. He\r\nwas also given sundry prebendal and other appointments in connection\r\nwith the chapter of the archdiocese of York. He spent nearly twenty\r\nyears in the discharge of his not very onerous duties and in reading,\r\npainting, shooting, and fiddling, without showing the least sign of\r\nany literary leanings. Then suddenly, in 1760, he took the world by\r\nstorm with the first two volumes of _Tristram Shandy_. He at once\r\nbecame the lion of the hour, was fêted and dined to his heart's\r\ncontent, and had his nostrils tickled with the daily incense of\r\npraise from his numerous worshippers. He repeated the experiment with\r\nequal success the following year with two more volumes of _Tristram_,\r\nand so at intervals until 1767, when he published the ninth and last\r\nvolume of this most peculiar story. In 1768 he brought out _A\r\nSentimental Journey_, and within three weeks he died in his lodgings\r\nin London. His other publications include _Sermons_ and _Letters_.\r\n_Tristram Shandy_ is unique in English literature--it stands _sui\r\ngeneris_ for all time. There is scarcely any consecutive narrative,\r\nand what there is is used merely as a peg on which to hang endless\r\ndigressions. But while there are many faults of taste and morals,\r\nthere are also genuine humor and pathos, and without Walter Shandy,\r\nDr. Slop, the Widow Wadman, Yorick, Uncle Toby, and Corporal Trim,\r\nEnglish literature would certainly be very much the poorer.\r\n\r\nHugh Kelly (1739-1777), born in Dublin, was the son of a publican and\r\nhimself became a staymaker, a trade from which he developed through\r\nthe successive stages of attorney's clerk, newspaper-writer,\r\ntheatrical critic, and essayist, into a novelist and playwright. His\r\nnovel, _Memoirs of a Magdalen_ (1767), was translated into French.\r\nHis first comedy, a sentimental one entitled _False Delicacy_ (1768),\r\nachieved a remarkable success on the stage and was even a greater\r\nsuccess in book form, 10,000 copies being sold in a year, so that its\r\nauthor was raised from poverty to comparative affluence. In addition,\r\nit gave him a European reputation, for it was translated into German,\r\nFrench, and Portuguese. Strange to say, his later comedies, _A Word\r\nto the Wise, A School for Wives_, and _The Man of Reason_, were\r\npractically failures, and the same is true of his tragedy,\r\n_Clementina_. Kelly ultimately withdrew from stage work, and for the\r\nlast three years of his life practised as a barrister without,\r\nhowever, achieving much distinction in his new profession.\r\n\r\nCharles Coffey (d. 1745), an Irishman, was the author of several\r\nfarces, operas, ballad operas, ballad farces, and farcical operas,\r\nthe best known of which was _The Devil to Pay, or the Wives\r\nMetamorphosed_ (1731).\r\n\r\nHenry Brooke (1703?-1783), a county Cavan man and the son of a\r\nclergyman, was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and afterwards\r\nstudied law in London. Becoming guardian to his cousin, a girl of\r\ntwelve, he put her to school for two years and then secretly married\r\nher. Of his large family of twenty-two children, three of whom were\r\nborn before their mother was eighteen years old, but one survived\r\nhim. Appointed by Lord Chesterfield barrack-master at Mullingar,\r\nBrooke afterwards settled in Co. Kildare. It was there that he wrote\r\nhis celebrated work, _The Fool of Quality, or the History of the Earl\r\nof Moreland_ (5 vols., 1766-1770), which won the commendations of men\r\nso widely different as John Wesley and Charles Kingsley. It is,\r\nindeed, a remarkable book, combining, as it does, many of the\r\ncharacteristics of Sterne, Mackenzie, Borrow, and George Meredith. It\r\nis not very well known nowadays, but it will always bear, and will\r\nwell repay, perusal. Brooke also wrote a poem on _Universal Beauty_\r\n(1735) and the tragedies _Gustavus Vasa_ (1739), the production of\r\nwhich was forbidden in London but which was afterwards staged in\r\nDublin as _The Patriot_, and _The Earl of Essex_ (1749), which was\r\nplayed both in London and in Dublin, and has been made famous by the\r\nparody of one line in it by Samuel Johnson. Another novel, _Juliet\r\nGrenville, or the History of the Human Heart_, published in 1774, was\r\nnot nearly up to the standard of _The Fool of Quality_. Brooke was a\r\nbusy literary man. He made a translation of part of Tasso, drafted\r\nplans for a History of Ireland, projected a series of old Irish\r\ntales, wrote one fragment in a style very like that subsequently\r\nadopted by Macpherson in his _Ossian_, and for a while was editor of\r\nthe _Freeman's Journal_. In the beginning, Brooke was violently\r\nanti-Catholic; but, as time progressed, he became more\r\nliberal-minded, and advocated the relaxation of the penal laws and a\r\nmore humane treatment of his Catholic fellow-countrymen. Like Swift\r\nand Steele, he fell into a state of mental debility for some years\r\nbefore his death. His daughter, Charlotte Brooke (1740-1793),\r\ndeserves mention as a pioneer of the Irish literary revival, for she\r\ndevoted herself to the saving of the stores of Irish literature which\r\nin her time were rapidly disappearing. One of the fruits of her\r\nlabors was _The Reliques of Irish Poetry_, published in 1789. She\r\nalso wrote _Emma, or the Foundling of the Wood_, a novel, and\r\n_Belisarius_, a tragedy.\r\n\r\nCharles Johnstone (c. 1719-1800), a Co. Limerick man, was educated in\r\nDublin and called to the English bar, but owing to deafness was more\r\nsuccessful as a chamber counsel than as a pleader. Emigrating to\r\nIndia in 1782, he became joint proprietor of a newspaper in Calcutta,\r\nand there he died. He wrote several satirical romances, such as\r\n_Chrysal, or the Adventures of a Guinea; The Reverie, or a Flight to\r\nthe Paradise of Fools_; and _The History of Arsaces, Prince of\r\nBetlis_. Of these the first was the best. Samuel Johnson, who read it\r\nin manuscript, advised its publication, and his opinion was\r\nvindicated, for it proved a huge success. Sir Walter Scott afterwards\r\nsaid that the author of _Chrysal_ deserved to rank as a prose\r\nJuvenal. Johnstone also wrote _The Pilgrim, or a Picture of Life_ and\r\na picaresque novel, _The History of John Juniper, Esquire, alias\r\nJuniper Jack_.\r\n\r\nArthur Murphy (1727-1805), born at Cloonquin, Co. Roscommon, was\r\neducated at St. Omer. At first an actor, he afterwards studied law\r\nand was called to the English bar in 1762. He made a translation of\r\nTacitus, and wrote several farces and comedies, among which may be\r\nmentioned _The Apprentice; The Spouter; The Upholsterer; The Way to\r\nKeep Him_; and _All in the Wrong_. He also wrote three tragedies,\r\nnamely, _The Orphan of China; The Grecian Daughter_; and _Arminius_.\r\nFor the last-named, which was produced in 1798, and which had a\r\nstrongly political cast, he received a pension of £200 a year. His\r\nplays long held the stage.\r\n\r\nOliver Goldsmith (1728-1774), essayist, poet, novelist, playwright,\r\nhistorian, biographer, and editor, was a many-sided genius, who, as\r\nJohnson said in his epitaph, left scarcely any kind of writing\r\nuntouched, and touched none that he did not adorn. Born, probably, in\r\nCo. Longford, the son of a poor clergyman, he was educated at various\r\ncountry schools until, in 1744, he secured a sizarship in Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin. There he had a somewhat stormy career, but\r\neventually took his degree in 1749. He then lounged at home for a\r\nwhile in his widowed mother's cottage at Ballymahon, until he was\r\npersuaded to take orders, but spoiled his already sufficiently poor\r\nchances of ordination by appearing before the bishop of Elphin in\r\nscarlet breeches. After other adventures in search of a profession,\r\nhe went to Edinburgh in 1752 to study medicine, and two years later\r\ntransferred himself to Leyden for the same purpose. It was from\r\nLeyden that, with one guinea in his pocket, one shirt on his person,\r\nand a flute in his hand, he started on his celebrated walking tour of\r\nEurope, during which he gained those impressions which he was\r\nafterwards to embody in some of his greater works. In 1756 he arrived\r\nin England, where for three years he had very varied experiences--as\r\na strolling player, an apothecary's journeyman, a practising\r\nphysician, a reader for the press, an usher in an academy, and a\r\nhack-writer. In 1759 he published anonymously his _Enquiry into the\r\nPresent State of Polite Learning in Europe_, which was well received\r\nand helped him to other literary work. _The Bee_, a volume of essays\r\nand verses, appeared in the same year. He was made editor of the\r\n_Lady's Magazine_; he published _Memoirs of Voltaire_ (1761), a\r\n_History of Mecklenburgh_ (1762), and a _Life of Richard Nash_\r\n(1762). In 1762 also he brought out his _Citizen of the World_, a\r\ncollection of essays, which takes an extremely high rank. In 1764 his\r\npoem, _The Traveller, or a Prospect of Society_, made its appearance;\r\nand in 1766 he gave to the world his famous novel, _The Vicar of\r\nWakefield_. His reputation as a writer was now established; he was\r\nreceived into Johnson's circle and was a member of the Literary Club;\r\nReynolds and Burke were proud to call him friend. In 1768 he had his\r\ncomedy, _The Good Natured Man_, produced at Covent Garden Theatre,\r\nwhere it achieved a fair measure of success and brought him in £400.\r\nIn 1770 he repeated his triumph as a poet with _The Deserted\r\nVillage_. He wrote a _History of Animated Nature_, a _History of\r\nEngland_, and a _History of Rome_, all compilations couched in that\r\neasy style of which he was master. He also wrote a _Life of Parnell_\r\nand a _Life of Bolingbroke_. Finally, in 1773, his great comedy, _She\r\nStoops to Conquer_, was staged at Covent Garden, and met with\r\nwonderful success. A little more than a year later Goldsmith died of\r\na nervous fever, the result of overwork and anxiety, and was buried\r\nin the burial ground of the Temple Church. His unfinished poem,\r\n_Retaliation_, a series of epigrams in epitaph form on some of his\r\ndistinguished literary and artistic friends, was issued a few days\r\nafter his death, and added greatly to his reputation as a wit and\r\nhumorist, a reputation which was still further enhanced when, in\r\n1776, _The Haunch of Venison_ made its appearance. In the latter year\r\na monument, with a medallion and Johnson's celebrated Latin epitaph\r\nattached, was erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nGoldsmith's renown, great in his own day, has never since diminished.\r\nHis essays, his novel, and his poems are still read with avidity and\r\npleasure; his comedy is still acted. It is his statue that stands\r\nalong with Burke's at the entrance gate to Trinity College, Dublin,\r\nthe _alma mater_ seeking to commemorate in a striking manner two of\r\nher most distinguished sons by placing their effigies thus in the\r\nforefront of her possessions and in full view of all the world.\r\nPersonally, Goldsmith was a very amiable and good-hearted man, dear\r\nto his own circle and dear to that \"Mr. Posterity\" to whom he once\r\naddressed a humorous dedication. He had his faults, it is true, but\r\nthey are hidden amid his many perfections. Everyone will be disposed\r\nto agree with what Johnson wrote of him: \"Let not his frailties be\r\nremembered; he was a very great man.\"\r\n\r\nEdmund Burke (1729-1797), born in Dublin, the son of a Protestant\r\nfather and a Catholic mother whose name was Nagle, was educated first\r\nat a Quaker school in Ballitore, Co. Kildare, and afterwards at\r\nTrinity College, Dublin. He became a law student in London, but he\r\ndid not eventually adopt the law as a profession. He brought out in\r\n1756 a _Vindication of Natural Society_, in which he so skilfully\r\nimitated the style and the paradoxical reasoning of Bolingbroke that\r\nmany were deceived into the belief that the _Vindication_ was a\r\nposthumously published production of the viscount's pen. In the\r\nfollowing year Burke published in his own name _A Philosophical\r\nInquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful_,\r\nwhich attracted widespread attention, was translated into German and\r\nFrench, and brought its author into touch with all the leading\r\nliterary men of London. He was instrumental with Dodsley the\r\npublisher in starting the _Annual Register_ in 1759, and for close on\r\nthirty years he continued to supply it with the \"Survey of Events.\"\r\nHe entered public life in 1760 by accompanying \"Single-Speech\"\r\nHamilton to Dublin when the latter was appointed Chief Secretary for\r\nIreland. In 1765 he was made private secretary to the prime minister,\r\nthe Marquis of Rockingham, and, as member for Wendover, entered\r\nparliament, where he speedily made a name for himself. During Lord\r\nNorth's long tenure of office (1770-1782) Burke was one of the\r\nminority and opposed the splendid force of his genius to the\r\ncorruption, extravagance, and mal-administration of the government.\r\nTo this period belong, in addition to lesser works, his great\r\nspeeches _On American Taxation_ (1774) and _On Conciliation with\r\nAmerica_ (1775), as well as his spirited _Letter to the Sheriffs of\r\nBristol_ (1777). He had been elected member of parliament for Bristol\r\nin 1774, but he lost his seat in 1780 because he had advocated the\r\nrelaxation of the restrictions on the trade of Ireland with Great\r\nBritain and of the penal laws against Catholics. In the second\r\nadministration of Rockingham (1782) and in that of Portland (1783) he\r\nwas paymaster of the forces, a position which he lost on the downfall\r\nof the Whigs in the latter year, and he never again held public\r\noffice. His speech on the impeachment of Warren Hastings in 1788 is\r\nuniversally and justly ranked as a masterpiece of eloquence. When the\r\nFrench Revolution broke out, he opposed it with might and main. His\r\n_Reflections on the French Revolution_ (1790) had an enormous\r\ncirculation, reached an eleventh edition inside of a year, was read\r\nall over the continent as well as in the British Isles, and helped\r\nmaterially not only to keep England steady in the crisis, but also to\r\nincite the other powers to continue their resistance to French\r\naggression. He continued his campaign in _Thoughts on French Affairs_\r\nand _Letters on a Regicide Peace_. He was given two pensions in 1794,\r\nand would have been raised to the peerage as Lord Beaconsfield, had\r\nnot the succession to the title been cut off by the premature death\r\nof his only son. He himself died in 1797 and was buried at\r\nBeaconsfield, where, as far back as 1768, he had purchased a small\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nAs an orator and a deep political thinker, Burke holds a foremost\r\nplace among those of all time who distinguished themselves in the\r\nBritish parliament. His keen intellect, his powerful imagination, his\r\nsympathy with the fallen, the downtrodden, and the oppressed, and his\r\nmatchless power of utterance of the thoughts that were in him have\r\nmade an impression that can never be effaced. His wise and\r\nstatesman-like views on questions affecting the colonies ought to\r\nendear him to all Americans, although, if his counsels had been\r\nhearkened to, it is probable that the separation from the mother\r\ncountry would not have occurred as soon as it did. For his native\r\nland he used his best endeavors when and how he could, and although,\r\nas her defender, he was faced by obloquy as well as by the loss of\r\nthat parliamentary position which was as dear to him as the breath of\r\nhis nostrils, he did not flinch or shrink from supporting her\r\nmaterial and spiritual interests in his own generous, manly,\r\nwhole-hearted way. Trinity College, Dublin, has done well in placing\r\nhis statue at her outer gates as representing the greatest Irishman\r\nof his generation.\r\n\r\nA political associate of Burke's for many years was Richard Brinsley\r\nSheridan (1751-1816). Of Co. Cavan descent, Sheridan was born in\r\nDublin, and was educated partly in his native city and partly at\r\nHarrow, and the remainder of his life was spent in England. He was\r\ndistinguished first as a playwright and afterwards as a parliamentary\r\norator. In 1775 his comedy, _The Rivals_, was produced at Covent\r\nGarden Theatre; his farce, _St. Patrick's Day, or the Scheming\r\nLieutenant_, and his comic opera, _The Duenna_, were staged in the\r\nsame year. His greatest comedy, _The School for Scandal_, was acted\r\nat Drury Lane Theatre in 1777, and it was followed in 1779 by _The\r\nCritic_. His last dramatic composition was the tragedy, _Pizarro_,\r\nproduced in 1799. Elected to parliament in 1780, Sheridan was made\r\nunder-secretary for foreign affairs in the Rockingham administration\r\nof 1782, and in 1783 he was secretary to the treasury in the\r\nCoalition Ministry. He sprang into repute as a brilliant orator\r\nduring the impeachment of Warren Hastings, 1787-1794. His speech on\r\nthe Begums of Oude was one of the greatest ever delivered within the\r\nwalls of the British parliament. In 1806, on the return of the Whigs\r\nto power, he was appointed treasurer in the navy. In 1812 his long\r\nparliamentary career came to a close when he was defeated for the\r\nborough of Westminster. He died in 1816, and was honored with a\r\nmagnificent funeral in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea as to how Sheridan's oratorical powers impressed his\r\ncontemporaries, it is perhaps enough to repeat what Burke said of his\r\nsecond speech against Warren Hastings, namely, that it was \"the most\r\nastonishing effort of eloquence, argument, and wit united of which\r\nthere is any record or tradition\", and to add that when, after three\r\nhours of impassioned pleading, he brought his first speech against\r\nHastings to an end, the effect produced was so great that it was\r\nagreed to adjourn the house immediately and defer the final decision\r\nuntil the members should be in a less excited mood. As a dramatist\r\nSheridan is second in popularity to Shakespeare alone. _The School\r\nfor Scandal_ and _The Rivals_ are as fresh and as eagerly welcomed\r\ntoday as they were a hundred and forty years ago. Like Burke, he was\r\ntrue to the land of his birth and his oppressed Catholic\r\nfellow-countrymen. Almost his last words in the house of commons were\r\nthese: \"Be just to Ireland. I will never give my vote to any\r\nadministration that opposes the question of Catholic emancipation.\"\r\n\r\nSheridan belonged to a family that was exceptionally distinguished in\r\nEnglish literature. Among those who preceded him as litterateurs were\r\nhis grandfather, the Rev. Thomas Sheridan, D.D.; his father, Thomas\r\nSheridan; and his mother, Frances Sheridan. Rev. Dr. Sheridan\r\n(1684-1738), the friend and confidant of Dean Swift, kept a\r\nfashionable school in Dublin, edited the _Satires_ of Persius in\r\n1728, wrote a treatise on _The Art of Punning_, and figures largely\r\nin Swift's correspondence. Thomas Sheridan (1721-1788) was at first\r\nan actor of considerable reputation, both in Dublin and in London;\r\nwas next a teacher of elocution; and finally came forward with an\r\nimproved system of education, in which oratory was to have a\r\nconspicuous part. In this connection he published an elaborate _Plan\r\nof Education_ in 1769, but his ideas, some of which are in accord\r\nwith modern practice, were not taken up, He also compiled a\r\npronouncing _Dictionary of the English Language_, with a prosodic\r\ngrammar, and in 1784 published an entertaining _Life of Swift_.\r\nFrances Sheridan (1724-1766), wife of Thomas and mother of Richard\r\nBrinsley, who as Frances Chamberlaine had been known as a poetess,\r\nwrote after her marriage two plays, _The Discovery_ and _The Dupe_,\r\nand two novels, _The Memoirs of Miss Sidney Biddulph_, which was a\r\ngreat success and was translated by the Abbé Prévost into French, and\r\n_The History of Nourjahad_, an Oriental tale. In 1775 the singular\r\nspectacle was presented of the son's play running at Covent Garden\r\nwhile the mother's was being acted at Drury Lane.\r\n\r\nAmong Sheridan's descendants who earned a niche in the temple of\r\nliterary fame were his grand-daughters, the Countess of Dufferin\r\n(1807-1867) and the Hon. Mrs. Norton, afterwards Lady Stirling\r\nMaxwell (1808-1877), and his great-grandson, the first Marquis of\r\nDufferin and Ava (1826-1902). Lady Dufferin's _Lament of the Irish\r\nEmigrant_ (\"I'm sittin' on the style, Mary\") has moved the hearts and\r\nbrought tears to the eyes of countless thousands since it was\r\npublished more than fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Francis (1740-1818), born in Dublin, was the son of a\r\nclergyman of like name who attained some literary eminence as the\r\ntranslator of Horace and as a political writer. After filling various\r\nimportant government positions, Philip Francis, the son, was in 1773\r\nmade a member of the Council of Bengal, where his relations with the\r\ngovernor-general, Warren Hastings, were of an extremely strained\r\ncharacter, amounting at times almost to a public scandal. He returned\r\nto England in 1781, entered parliament, made a name as a speaker,\r\ntook part in the impeachment of Hastings, and composed numerous\r\npolitical pamphlets. He is generally supposed to have been the writer\r\nof the celebrated _Letters of Junius_, which appeared at intervals in\r\nthe _Public Advertiser_ between January 21, 1769, and January 21,\r\n1772. These letters are distinguished for their polished style, their\r\npower of invective, their galling sarcasm, their knowledge of state\r\nsecrets, and their unparalleled boldness. Every prominent man\r\nconnected with the government was attacked: even the king himself was\r\nnot spared. As revised by their pseudonymous writer in a reprint made\r\nin 1772, they number 70; a later edition, in 1812, contained 113\r\nmore. Their authorship has been the subject of much controversy, nor\r\nis the question yet finally settled. In his _Essay on Warren\r\nHastings_, written in 1841, Macaulay went to considerable trouble to\r\nprove, by the cumulative method, that Francis was the writer, and\r\nsince then that opinion has been generally, but not universally,\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nIsaac Bickerstaffe (c. 1735-c. 1812) was an Irishman, whose name,\r\nstrange to say, had no connection with the _nom de guerre_ of the\r\nsame style under which Swift had masqueraded in his outrageously\r\nsatirical attacks on Partridge the almanac maker, or with the more\r\ncelebrated imaginary Isaac Bickerstaffe under cover of whose\r\npersonality Steele conducted the _Tatler_. The real Bickerstaffe was\r\na prolific playwright. His best known pieces are _The Sultan_, _The\r\nMaid of the Mill_, _Lionel and Clarissa_, and _Love in a Village_. In\r\nthe last-mentioned occurs the famous song, beginning \"We all love a\r\npretty girl--under the rose.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Drennan (1754-1820), who has been called the Tyrtaeus of the\r\nUnited Irishmen, was the son of a Presbyterian clergyman, was born in\r\nBelfast, and was educated at Glasgow and Edinburgh universities,\r\ntaking a medical degree from the latter. He practised his profession\r\nin the north of Ireland. When the Irish Volunteers were established,\r\nDrennan entered heart and soul into the movement. Removing to Dublin\r\nin 1789, he associated with Tone and other revolutionary spirits, and\r\nbecame one of the founders of the Society of United Irishmen, the\r\nfirst statement of whose objects was the product of his pen. His\r\n_Letters of Orellana_ helped materially to enlist the men of Ulster\r\nin the ranks of the Society. He also wrote a series of stirring\r\nlyrics which, voicing as they did the general sentiment in Ireland at\r\nthe time, became extremely popular and had a widespread effect. These\r\nwere afterwards (1815) collected under the title of _Fugitive\r\nPieces_. All his political hopes being blasted with the failure of\r\nthe rebellion of 1798 and of Emmet's insurrection in 1803, Drennan\r\nreturned in 1807 to Belfast and there founded the _Belfast Magazine_.\r\n\"The Wake of William Orr\", a series of noble and affecting stanzas\r\ncommemorating the judicial murder of a young Presbyterian Irish\r\npatriot in 1798, is one of his best known pieces. He also celebrated\r\nthe ill-fated brothers Sheares. His song \"Erin\" was considered by\r\nMoore to be one of the most perfect of modern songs. It was in this\r\npiece that he fixed upon Ireland the title of the Emerald Isle:\r\n\r\n      When Erin first rose from the dark swelling flood,\r\n      God bless'd the green island, and saw it was good;\r\n      The em'rald of Europe, it sparkled and shone--\r\n      In the ring of the world the most precious stone.\r\n\r\nMary Tighe (1772-1810), whose maiden name was Blachford, was born,\r\nthe daughter of a clergyman, in Co. Wicklow. She contracted an\r\nunhappy marriage with her cousin who represented Kilkenny in the\r\nIrish house of commons. By all accounts she was of great beauty and\r\nnumerous accomplishments. She wrote many poems: her best, and best\r\nknown, is _Psyche, or the Legend of Love_, an adaptation of the story\r\nof Cupid and Psyche from the _Golden Ass_ of Apuleius. The metre she\r\nemployed in this piece was the Spenserian stanza, which she handled\r\nwith great power, freedom, and melody. _Psyche_, which first appeared\r\nin 1795, had a wonderful vogue, running rapidly through edition after\r\nedition. Among others to whom it appealed and who were influenced by\r\nit was Keats. Mrs. Tighe's talent drew from Moore a delicate\r\ncompliment in \"Tell me the witching tale again\"; and in \"The Grave of\r\na Poetess\" and \"I stood where the life of song lay low\", Mrs. Hemans\r\nbewailed her untimely death.\r\n\r\nEdmund Malone (1741-1813), the son of an Irish judge, was born in\r\nDublin and studied at Trinity College. He was called to the Irish bar\r\nin 1767, but coming into a fortune, he abandoned his profession and\r\ngave himself over to literary work. In 1790 he brought out an edition\r\nof Shakespeare which was deservedly praised for its learning and\r\nresearch. His critical acumen led him to doubt the genuineness of\r\nChatterton's _Rowley Poems_, and he was one of the first to expose\r\nIreland's Shakespearean forgeries in 1796. Among other services to\r\nliterature he wrote a _Life of Sir Joshua Reynolds_ and edited\r\nDryden. He also left a quantity of materials afterwards utilized for\r\nthe \"Variorum Shakespeare\" by James Boswell the younger in 1821.\r\n\r\nJohn O'Keeffe (1747-1833), a Dublin man, was at first an art student,\r\nbut soon became an actor, and then developed into a playwright. His\r\npen was most prolific; he published a collection of over fifty pieces\r\nin 1798. His plays are mostly comic operas or farces, and some of\r\nthem had great success. Lingo, the schoolmaster in _The Agreeable\r\nSurprise_, is a very amusing character. _The Positive Man, The\r\nSon-in-Law, Wild Oats, Love in a Camp_, and _The Poor Soldier_ are\r\namong his compositions. His songs are well known, such as \"I am a\r\nfriar of orders grey\", and there are few schoolboys who have not\r\nsooner or later made the acquaintance of his \"Amo, amas, I loved a\r\nlass\". For the last fifty-two years of his life O'Keeffe was blind,\r\nan affliction which he bore with unfailing cheerfulness. In 1826 he\r\nwas given a pension of one hundred guineas a year from the king's\r\nprivy purse.\r\n\r\nGeorge Canning (1770-1827), prime minister of England, properly\r\nbelongs here, for, although born in London, he was a member of an\r\nIrish family long settled at Garvagh in Co. Derry. Entering\r\nparliament on the side of Pitt in 1796, he was made secretary of the\r\nnavy in 1804 and in 1812 secretary of State for foreign affairs. He\r\nbecame prime minister in 1827, but died within six months, leaving a\r\nrecord for scarcely surpassed eloquence. In addition to his speeches,\r\nhe is known in literature for his contributions to the _Anti-Jacobin,\r\nor Weekly Examiner_, which ran its satirical and energetic career for\r\neight months (November, 1797-July, 1798.) Some of the best things\r\nthat appeared in this ultra-conservative organ were from Canning's\r\npen. Few there are who have not laughed at his _Loves of the\r\nTriangles_, in which he caricatured Erasmus Darwin's _Loves of the\r\nPlants_; at _The Needy Knife-Grinder_; or at the song of Rogero in\r\n_The Rovers_, with its comic refrain of the\r\n\r\n                          U--\r\n      niversity of Gottingen.\r\n\r\nLike most of the great Anglo-Irishmen of his time, Canning favored\r\nCatholic emancipation. It is interesting to note that it was a letter\r\nof Canning's that led to the formulation of the Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\nHenry Grattan (1746-1820), the hero of Grattan's parliament, was born\r\nin Dublin and studied at Trinity College. His history belongs to that\r\nof his country. Suffice it here to say that not only did he by great\r\neloquence and real statesmanship secure a free parliament for Ireland\r\nIn 1782, but also that he fought energetically, if unavailingly,\r\nagainst the abolition of that parliament in 1800, and that\r\nthenceforward he devoted his abilities to promoting the cause of\r\nCatholic emancipation. Dying in London, he was honored by being\r\nburied in Westminster Abbey. In an age of great orators he stands out\r\namong the very foremost. His speeches have become classics, and are\r\nconstantly quoted.\r\n\r\nAnother brilliant Irish orator, as well as an eminent wit, of this\r\nperiod, was John Philpot Curran (1750-1817), who, born at Newmarket,\r\nCo. Cork, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin, achieved a\r\nwonderful success at the Irish bar. He defended with rare insight,\r\neloquence, and patriotism those who were accused of complicity in the\r\nrebellion of 1798. As a member of Grattan's parliament, he voiced the\r\nmost liberal principles, and, though a Protestant himself, he worked\r\nhard in the Catholic cause. He held the great office of Master of the\r\nRolls in Ireland from 1806 to 1814. The memory of few Irish orators,\r\nwits, or patriots is greener today than that of Curran. His daughter\r\nSarah, whose fate is so inextricably blended with that of the\r\nill-starred Robert Emmet, has been rendered immortal by Moore in his\r\nbeautiful song, \"She is far from the land where her young hero\r\nsleeps\".\r\n\r\nMary Wollstonecraft Godwin (1759-1797), the first advocate of the\r\nrights of women, though born in London, was of Irish extraction. Into\r\nthe details of her extraordinary and chequered career it is not\r\npossible, or necessary, here to enter. Her published works include\r\n_Thoughts on the Education of Daughters_ (1787); _Answer to Burke's\r\nReflections on the French Revolution_ (1791); _Vindication of the\r\nRights of Women_ (1792); and an unfinished _Historical and Moral View\r\nof the French Revolution_ (Vol. I., 1794). Having in August, 1797,\r\nborne to her husband, William Godwin, a daughter who afterwards\r\nbecame Shelley's second wife, Mary Godwin died in the following\r\nmonth. Whatever her faults--and they were perhaps not greater than\r\nher misfortunes--she had something of the divine touch of genius,\r\nand, in a different environment, might easily have left some great\r\nliterary memento which the world would not willingly let die.\r\n\r\nMaria Edgeworth (1767-1849), though born at Blackbourton in England,\r\nbelonged to a family which had been settled in different parts of\r\nIreland and finally at Edgeworthstown, Co. Longford, for nearly two\r\nhundred years. She was the daughter of Richard Lovell Edgeworth\r\n(1744-1817), who was distinguished for his inventions, for his\r\neccentricity, and for his varied matrimonial experiences, and who\r\nhimself figures in literature as the author of _Memoirs_,\r\nposthumously published in 1820, and as the partner with his daughter\r\nin _Practical Education_ (1798) and in an _Essay on Irish Bulls_\r\n(1802). Maria had a busy literary career and was before the public\r\nfor fifty-two years from 1795 to 1847. She wrote _Moral Tales;\r\nPopular Tales; Tales from Fashionable Life_; and _Harrington_; but\r\nshe is now best remembered for her three masterpieces dealing with\r\nIrish life and conditions, namely, _Castle Rackrent_ (1800); _The\r\nAbsentee_ (1812); and _Ormond_ (1817). By these works she inspired\r\nScott, as he himself tells us, to attempt for his own country\r\nsomething \"of the same kind with that which she had so fortunately\r\nachieved for Ireland\", and in a later day she inspired Turgenief to\r\ndo similarly for Russia. She excels in wit and pathos and gives a\r\ntrue and vivid presentation of the times and conditions as she viewed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAndrew Cherry (1763-1821), born in Limerick, became an actor, a\r\ntheatrical manager, and a playwright. He wrote nine or ten plays,\r\nseveral of which were moderately successful. The one that is now\r\nremembered is _The Soldier's Daughter_. Some of his songs, such as\r\n\"The Bay of Biscay\", \"Tom Moody, the Whipper-in\", and, especially,\r\n\"The Green Little Shamrock of Ireland\", bid fair to be immortal.\r\n\r\nOther Irish song-writers were Thomas Duffet (fl. 1676), author of\r\n\"Come all you pale lovers\"; Arthur Dawson (1700?-1775), author of\r\n\"Bumpers, Squire Jones\"; George Ogle (1742-1814), author of \"Molly\r\nAsthore\"; Richard Alfred Millikin (1767-1815), author of the\r\ngrotesque \"Groves of Blarney\"; Edward Lysaght (1763-1811), author of\r\n\"Our Ireland\", \"The Gallant Man who led the van Of the Irish\r\nVolunteers\", and \"Kate of Garnavilla\"; George Nugent Reynolds\r\n(1770?-1802), author of \"Kathleen O'More\"; Thomas Dermody\r\n(1775-1802), author of the collection of poems and songs known as\r\n_The Harp of Erin_; James Orr (1770-1816), author of \"The Irishman\";\r\nHenry Brereton Code (d. 1830), author of \"The Sprig of Shillelah\";\r\nCharles Wolfe (1791-1823), author of \"If I had thought thou couldst\r\nhave died\", and of \"The Burial of Sir John Moore\"; and Charles Dawson\r\nShanly (1811-1875), author of \"Kitty of Coleraine\".\r\n\r\nTheobald Wolfe Tone (1763-1798), born in Dublin, educated at Trinity\r\nCollege, and called to the Irish bar in 1789, fills a large space in\r\nthe history of his country from 1790 to his death in 1798. Intrepid,\r\ndaring, and resourceful, he was one of the most dangerous of the\r\nenemies to English domination in Ireland that arose at any time\r\nduring the troubled relations between the two countries. Taken\r\nprisoner on board a French ship of the line bound for Ireland on a\r\nmission of freedom, he committed suicide in prison rather than submit\r\nto the ignominy of being hanged to which he had been condemned. He\r\nsleeps his last sleep in Bodenstown churchyard, in that county of\r\nKildare to which he was connected by many ties. His grave is still\r\nthe Mecca of many a pilgrimage, and the corner-stone of a statue to\r\nhis memory has been laid for some years on a commanding site in the\r\ncity of his birth. He is known in literature for his _Journals_ and\r\nhis _Autobiography_, both containing sad, but inspiring, reading for\r\nthe Irishman of today.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere this rapid survey of Irish writers of English must close. To\r\ntell in any sort of appropriate detail the story of the English\r\nliterature of Ireland in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries would\r\nrequire a separate volume--a volume which is now under way and will,\r\nit is hoped, be speedily forthcoming. There is all the less need to\r\nattempt the agreeable task here, because in other portions of this\r\nbook much more than passing reference is made to the chief Irish\r\nauthors who, in the last hundred and fifteen years, have\r\ndistinguished themselves and shed lustre on their country. During\r\nthat period Irish poets, playwrights, novelists, essayists,\r\nhistorians, biographers, humorists, critics, and scholars have fully\r\nheld their own both in the quantity and the quality of the work\r\nproduced, and have left an impression of power and personality, of\r\ngraceful style and vivifying imagination, that in itself constitutes,\r\nand must for ever constitute, one of the distinctive Glories of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nIrish Literature (10 vols., New York, 1904); Chambers's Cyclopaedia\r\nof English Literature (3 vols., Philadelphia and London, 1902-1904);\r\nDictionary of National Biography; Encyclopaedia Britannica; Cambridge\r\nHistory of English Literature; D'Alton: History of Ireland (London,\r\n1910); Lennox: Early Printing in Ireland (Washington, 1909), Addison\r\nand the Modern Essay (Washington, 1912), Lessons in English\r\nLiterature (21st edition, Baltimore, 1913); Macaulay: Essays, History\r\nof England; Brown: A Reader's Guide to Irish Fiction (London, 1910),\r\nA Guide to Books on Ireland (Dublin, 1912).",
