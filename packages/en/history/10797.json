be\r\nUngrateful.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad this elegant writer, remarks the compiler of 'Walpoliana,' composed\r\nmemoirs of his own life, an example authorized by eminent names, ancient\r\nand modern, every other pen must have been dropped in despair, so true\r\nwas it that 'he united the good sense of Fontenelle with the Attic salt\r\nand graces of Count Anthony Hamilton.'\r\n\r\nBut 'Horace' was a man of great literary modesty, and always undervalued\r\nhis own efforts. His life was one of little incident: it is his\r\ncharacter, his mind, the society around him, the period in which he\r\nshone, that give the charm to his correspondence, and the interest to\r\nhis biography.\r\n\r\nBesides, he had the weakness common to several other fine gentlemen who\r\nhave combined letters and _haut ton_, of being ashamed of the literary\r\ncharacter. The vulgarity of the court, its indifference to all that was\r\nnot party writing, whether polemical or political, cast a shade over\r\nauthors in his time.\r\n\r\nNever was there, beneath all his assumed Whig principles, a more\r\nprofound aristocrat than Horace Walpole. He was, by birth, one of those\r\nwell-descended English gentlemen who have often scorned the title of\r\nnoble, and who have repudiated the notion of merging their own ancient\r\nnames in modern titles. The commoners of England hold a proud\r\npre-eminence. When some low-born man entreated James I. to make him a\r\ngentleman, the well-known answer was, 'Na, na, I canna! I could mak thee\r\na lord, but none but God Almighty can mak a gentleman.'\r\n\r\nSir Robert Walpole, afterwards minister to George II., and eventually\r\nLord Orford, belonged to an ancient family in Norfolk; he was a third\r\nson, and was originally destined for the Church, but the death of his\r\nelder brethren having left him heir to the family estate, in 1698, he\r\nsucceeded to a property which ought to have yielded him £2,000 a year,\r\nbut which was crippled with various encumbrances. In order to relieve\r\nhimself of these, Sir Robert married Catherine Shorter, the\r\ngranddaughter of Sir John Shorter, who had been illegally and\r\narbitrarily appointed Lord Mayor of London by James II.\r\n\r\nHorace was her youngest child, and was born in Arlington Street, on the\r\n24th of September, 1717, O.S. Six years afterwards he was inoculated for\r\nthe small-pox, a precaution which he records as worthy of remark, since\r\nthe operation had then only recently been introduced by Lady Mary\r\nWortley Montagu from Turkey.\r\n\r\nHe is silent, however, naturally enough, as to one important point--his\r\nreal parentage. The character of his mother was by no means such as to\r\ndisprove an assertion which gained general belief: this was, that Horace\r\nwas the offspring, not of Sir Robert Walpole, but of Carr, Lord Hervey,\r\nthe eldest son of the Earl of Bristol, and the elder brother of Lord\r\nHervey, whose 'Memoirs of the Court of George II.' are so generally\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nCarr, Lord Hervey, was witty, eccentric, and sarcastic: and from him\r\nHorace Walpole is said to have inherited his wit, his eccentricity, his\r\nlove of literature, and his profound contempt for all mankind, excepting\r\nonly a few members of a cherished and exclusive _clique_.\r\n\r\nIn the Notes of his life which Horace Walpole left for the use of his\r\nexecutor, Robert Berry, Esq., and of his daughter, Miss Berry, he makes\r\nthis brief mention of Lady Walpole:--'My mother died in 1737.' He was\r\nthen twenty years of age.\r\n\r\nBut beneath this seemingly slight recurrence to his mother, a regret\r\nwhich never left him through life was buried. Like Cowper, he mourned,\r\nas the profoundest of all sorrows, the loss of that life-long friend.\r\n\r\n  'My mother, when I learn'd that thou wast dead,\r\n  Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?\r\n  Hovered thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son?\r\n  Wretch even then, life's journey just begun.'\r\n\r\nAlthough Horace in many points bore a strong resemblance to Sir Robert\r\nWalpole, he rarely if ever received from that jovial, heartless, able\r\nman, any proof of affection. An outcast from his father's heart, the\r\nwhole force of the boy's love centred in his mother; yet in after-life\r\nno one reverenced Sir Robert Walpole so much as his supposed son. To be\r\nadverse to the minister was to be adverse to the unloved son who\r\ncherished his memory. What 'my father' thought, did, and said, was law;\r\nwhat his foes dared to express was heresy. Horace had the family mania\r\nstrong upon him; the world was made for Walpoles, whose views were never\r\nto be controverted, nor whose faith impugned. Yet Horace must have\r\nwitnessed, perhaps with out comprehending it, much disunion at home.\r\nLady Walpole. beautiful and accomplished, could not succeed in riveting\r\nher husband to his conjugal duties. Gross licentiousness was the order\r\nof the day, and Sir Robert was among the most licentious; he left his\r\nlovely wife to the perilous attentions of all the young courtiers who\r\nfancied that by courting the Premier's wife they could secure Walpole's\r\ngood offices. Sir Robert, according to Pope, was one of those who--\r\n\r\n  'Never made a friend in private life,\r\n  And was, besides, a tyrant to his wife.\r\n\r\nAt all events, if not a tyrant, he was indifferent to those\r\ncircumstances which reflected upon him, and were injurious to her. He\r\nwas conscious that he had no right to complain of any infidelity on her\r\npart, and he left her to be surrounded by men whom he knew to be\r\nprofligates of the most dangerous pretensions to wit and elegance.\r\n\r\nIt was possibly not unfrequently that Horace, his mother's pet, gleaned\r\nin the drawing-rooms of Arlington Street his first notions of that\r\n_persiflage_ which was the fashion of the day. We. can fancy him a\r\nprecocious, old-fashioned little boy, at his mother's apron-string,\r\nwhilst Carr, Lord Hervey, was paying his devoirs; we see him gazing with\r\nwondering eyes at Pulteney, Earl of Bath, with his blue ribbon across\r\nhis laced coat; whilst compassionating friends observing the pale-faced\r\nboy in that hot-house atmosphere, in which both mind and body were like\r\nforced plants, prophesied that 'little Horace' could not possibly live\r\nto be a man.\r\n\r\nHe survived, however, two sisters, who died in childhood, and became\r\ndearer and dearer to his fond mother.\r\n\r\nIn his old age, Horace delighted in recalling anecdotes of his infancy;\r\nin these his mother's partiality largely figured. Brought up among\r\ncourtiers and ministers, his childish talk was all of kings and princes;\r\nand he was a gossip both by inclination and habit. His greatest desire\r\nin life was to see the king--George I., and his nurses and attendants\r\naugmented his wish by their exalted descriptions of the grandeur which\r\nhe effected, in after-life, to despise. He entreated his mother to take\r\nhim to St. James's. When relating the incidents of the scene in which he\r\nwas first introduced to a court, Horace Walpole speaks of the 'infinite\r\ngood-nature of his father, who never thwarted any of his children,' and\r\n'suffered him,' he says, 'to be too much indulged.'\r\n\r\nSome difficulties attended the fruition of the forward boy's wish. The\r\nDuchess of Kendal was jealous of Sir Robert Walpole's influence with the\r\nking: her aim was to bring Lord Bolingbroke into power. The childish\r\nfancy was, nevertheless, gratified: and under his mother's care he was\r\nconducted to the apartments of the Duchess of Kendal in St. James's.\r\n\r\n'A favour so unusual to be asked by a boy of ten years old,' he\r\nafterwards wrote in his 'Reminiscences,' 'was still too slight to be\r\nrefused to the wife of the first minister and her darling child.'\r\nHowever, as it was not to be a precedent, the interview was to be\r\nprivate, and at night.\r\n\r\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening when Lady Walpole, leading her son,\r\nwas admitted into the apartments of Melusina de Schulenberg, Countess of\r\nWalsingham, who passed under the name of the Duchess of Kendal's niece,\r\nbut who was, in fact, her daughter, by George I. The polluted rooms in\r\nwhich Lady Walsingham lived were afterwards occupied by the two\r\nmistresses of George II.--the Countess of Suffolk, and Madame de\r\nWalmoden, Countess of Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nWith Lady Walsingham, Lady Walpole and her little son waited until,\r\nnotice having been given that the king had come down to supper, he was\r\nled into the presence of 'that good sort of man,' as he calls George I.\r\nThat monarch was pleased to permit the young courtier to kneel down and\r\nkiss his hand. A few words were spoken by the august personage, and\r\nHorace was led back into the adjoining room.\r\n\r\nBut the vision of that 'good sort of man' was present to him when, in\r\nold age, he wrote down his recollections for his beloved Miss Berry. By\r\nthe side of a tall, lean, ill-favoured old German lady--the Duchess of\r\nKendal--stood a pale, short, elderly man, with a dark tie-wig, in a\r\nplain coat and waistcoat: these and his breeches were all of\r\nsnuff-coloured cloth, and his stockings of the same colour. By the blue\r\nriband alone could the young subject of this 'good sort of man' discern\r\nthat he was in the presence of majesty. Little interest could be\r\nelicited in this brief interview, yet Horace thought it his painful\r\nduty, being also the son of a prime minister, to shed tears when, with\r\nthe other scholars of Eton College, he walked in the procession to the\r\nproclamation of George II. And no doubt he was one of _very_ few\r\npersonages in England whose eyes Were moistened for that event.\r\nNevertheless, there was something of _bonhommie_ in the character of\r\nGeorge I. that one misses in his successor. His love of punch, and his\r\nhabit of becoming a little tipsy over his private dinners with Sir\r\nRobert Walpole, were English as well as German traits, and were regarded\r\nalmost as condescensions; and then he had a kind of slow wit, that was\r\nturned upon the venial officials whose perquisites were at their\r\ndisgraceful height in his time.\r\n\r\n'A strange country this,' said the monarch, in his most clamorous\r\nGerman: 'one day, after I came to St. James's, I looked out of the\r\nwindow, and saw a park, with walks, laurels, &c.; these they told me\r\nwere mine. The next day Lord Chetwynd, the ranger of _my_ park, sends me\r\na brace of carp out of my canal; I was told, thereupon, that I must give\r\nfive guineas to Lord Chetwynd's porter for bringing me my _own_ fish,\r\nout of my _own_ canal, in my _own_ park!' In spite of some agreeable\r\nqualities, George I. was, however, anything but a 'good sort of man.' It\r\nis difficult how to rank the two first Georges; both were detestable as\r\nmen, and scarcely tolerable as monarchs. The foreign deeds of George I.\r\nwere stained with the supposed murder of Count Konigsmark: the English\r\ncareer of George II. was one of the coarsest profligacy. Their example\r\nwas infamous.\r\n\r\nHis father's only sister having become the second wife of Charles Lord\r\nTownshend, Horace was educated with his cousins; and the tutor selected\r\nwas Edward Weston, the son of Stephen, Bishop of Exeter; this preceptor\r\nwas afterwards engaged in a controversy with Dr. Warburton, concerning\r\nthe 'Naturalization of the Jews.' By that learned, haughty disputant, he\r\nis termed 'a gazetteer by profession--by inclination a Methodist.' Such\r\nwas the man who guided the dawning intellect of Horace Walpole. Under\r\nhis care he remained until he went, in 1727, to Eton. But Walpole's was\r\nnot merely a scholastic education: he was destined for the law--and, on\r\ngoing up to Cambridge, was obliged to attend lectures on civil law. He\r\nwent from Eton to King's College--where he was, however, more disposed\r\nto what are termed accomplishments than to deep reading. At Cambridge he\r\neven studied Italian; at home he learned to dance and fence; and took\r\nlessons in drawing from Bernard Lens, drawing-master to the Duke of\r\nCumberland and his sisters. It is not to be wondered at that he left\r\nCambridge without taking a degree.\r\n\r\nBut fortune was lying, as it were, in wait for him; and various\r\nsinecures had been reserved for the Minister's youngest son: first, he\r\nbecame Inspector of the Imports and Exports in the Customs; but soon\r\nresigned that post to be Usher of the Exchequer. 'And as soon,' he\r\nwrites, 'as I became of age I took possession of two other little patent\r\nplaces in the Exchequer, called Comptroller of the Pipe, and Clerk of\r\nthe Estreats. They had been held for me by Mr. Fane.'\r\n\r\nSuch was the mode in which the younger sons were then provided for by a\r\nminister; nor has the unworthy system died out in our time, although\r\ngreatly modified.\r\n\r\nHorace was growing up meantime, not an awkward, but a somewhat\r\ninsignificant youth, with a short, slender figure: which always retained\r\na boyish appearance when seen from behind. His face was common-place,\r\nexcept when his really expressive eyes sparkled with intelligence, or\r\nmelted into the sweetest expression of kindness. But his laugh was\r\nforced and uncouth: and even in his smile there was a hard, sarcastic\r\nexpression that made one regret that he smiled.\r\n\r\nHe was now in possession of an income of £1,700 annually, and he looked\r\nnaturally to the Continent, to which all young members of the\r\naristocracy repaired, after the completion of their collegiate life.\r\n\r\nHe had been popular at Eton: he was also, it is said, both beloved and\r\nvalued at Cambridge. In reference to his Etonian days he says, in one of\r\nhis letters, 'I can't say I am sorry I was never quite a schoolboy: an\r\nexpedition against bargemen, or a match at cricket, may be very pretty\r\nthings to recollect; but, thank my stars, I can remember things that are\r\nvery near as pretty. The beginning of my Roman history was spent in the\r\nasylum, or conversing in Egeria's hallowed grove; not in thumping and\r\npummelling King Amulius's herdsmen.[1]\r\n\r\n[1: Life by Warburton, p 70.]\r\n\r\n'I remember,' he adds, 'when I was at Eton, and Mr. Bland had set me on\r\nan extraordinary task, I used sometimes to pique myself upon not getting\r\nit, because it was not immediately my school business. What! learn more\r\nthan I was absolutely forced to learn! I felt the weight of learning\r\nthat; for I was a blockhead, _and pushed above my parts_.'[2]\r\n\r\n[2: Life of Warburton, p. 63.]\r\n\r\nPopular amongst his schoolfellows, Horace formed friendships at Eton\r\nwhich mainly influenced his after-life. Richard West, the son of West,\r\nLord Chancellor of Ireland, and the grandson, on his mother's side, of\r\nBishop Burnet; together with a youth named Assheton--formed, with the\r\npoet Gray, and Horace himself, what the young wit termed the 'Quadruple\r\nAlliance.' Then there was the 'triumvirate,' George Montagu, Charles\r\nMontagu, and Horace: next came George Selwyn and Hanbury Williams;\r\nlastly, a retired, studious youth, a sort of foil to all these gay,\r\nbrilliant young wits--a certain William Cole, a lover of old books, and\r\nof quaint prints. And in all these boyish friendships, some of which\r\nwere carried from Eton to Cambridge, may be traced the foundation of the\r\nHorace Walpole, of Strawberry Hill and of Berkeley Square. To Gray he\r\nowed his ambition to be learned, if possible--poetical, if nature had\r\nnot forbidden; to the Montagus, his dash and spirit; to Sir Hanbury\r\nWilliams, his turn for _jeux d'esprit_, as a part of the completion of a\r\nfine gentleman's education; to George Selwyn, his appreciation of what\r\nwas then considered wit--but which we moderns are not worthy to\r\nappreciate. Lord Hertford and Henry Conway, Walpole's cousins, were also\r\nhis schoolfellows; and for them he evinced throughout his long life a\r\nwarm regard. William Pitt, Lord Chatham--chiefly remembered at Eton for\r\nhaving been flogged for being out of bounds--was a contemporary, though\r\nnot an intimate, of Horace Walpole's at Eton.\r\n\r\nHis regard for Gray did him infinite credit: yet never were two men more\r\ndissimilar as they advanced in life. Gray had no aristocratic birth to\r\nboast; and Horace dearly loved birth, refinement, position, all that\r\ncomprises the cherished term 'aristocracy.' Thomas Gray, more\r\nillustrious for the little his fastidious judgment permitted him to give\r\nto the then critical world, than many have been in their productions of\r\nvolumes, was born in Cornhill--his father being a worthy citizen. He was\r\njust one year older than Walpole, but an age his senior in gravity,\r\nprecision, and in a stiff resolution to maintain his independence. He\r\nmade one fatal step, fatal to his friendship for Horace, when he\r\nforfeited--by allowing Horace to take him and pay his expenses during a\r\nlong continental tour--his independence. Gray had many points which made\r\nhim vulnerable to Walpole's shafts of ridicule; and Horace had a host of\r\nfaults which excited the stern condemnation of Gray. The author of the\r\n'Elegy'--which Johnson has pronounced to be the noblest ode in our\r\nlanguage--was one of the most learned men of his time, 'and was equally\r\nacquainted with the elegant and profound paths of science, and that not\r\nsuperficially, but thoroughly; knowing in every branch of history, both\r\nnatural and civil, as having read all the original historians of\r\nEngland, France, and Italy; a great antiquarian, who made criticisms,\r\nmetaphysics, morals, and politics a principal part of his plan of\r\nstudy--who was uncommonly fond of voyages and travels of all sorts--and\r\nwho had a fine taste in painting, prints, architecture, and gardening'\r\nWhat a companion for a young man of taste and sympathy! but the friends\r\nwere far too clever long to agree. Gray was haughty, impatient,\r\nintolerant of the peculiarities of others, according to the author of\r\n'Walpoliana:' doubtless he detected the vanity, the actual selfishness,\r\nthe want of earnest feeling in Horace, which had all been kept down at\r\nschool, where boys are far more unsparing Mentors than their betters. In\r\nvain did they travel _en prince_, and all at Walpole's expense; in vain\r\ndid they visit courts, and receive affability from princes: in vain did\r\nhe of Cornhill participate for a brief period in the attentions lavished\r\non the son of a British Prime Minister: they quarrelled--and we almost\r\nreverence Gray for that result, more especially when we find the author\r\nof 'Walpoliana' expressing his conviction that 'had it not been for this\r\nidle indulgence of his hasty temper, Mr. Gray would immediately on his\r\nreturn home have received, as usual, a pension or office from Sir Robert\r\nWalpole.' We are inclined to feel contempt for the anonymous writer of\r\nthat amusing little book.\r\n\r\nAfter a companionship of four years, Gray, nevertheless, returned to\r\nLondon. He had been educated with the expectation of being a barrister;\r\nbut finding that funds were wanting to pursue a legal education, he gave\r\nup a set of chambers in the Temple, which he had occupied previous to\r\nhis travels, and retired to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nHenceforth what a singular contrast did the lives of these once fond\r\nfriends present! In the small, quaint rooms of Peter-House,[3] Gray\r\nconsumed a dreary celibacy, consoled by the Muse alone, who--if other\r\ndamsels found no charms in his somewhat piggish, wooden countenance, or\r\nin his manners, replete, it is said, with an unpleasant consciousness of\r\nsuperiority--never deserted him. His college existence, varied only by\r\nhis being appointed Professor of Modern History, was, for a brief space,\r\nexchanged for an existence almost as studious in London. Between the\r\nyears 1759 and 1762, he took lodgings, we find, in Southampton Row--a\r\npleasant locality then, opening to the fields--in order to be near the\r\nBritish Museum, at that time just opened to the public. Here his intense\r\nstudies were, it may be presumed, relieved by the lighter task of\r\nperusing the Harleian Manuscripts; and here he formed the acquaintance\r\nof Mason, a dull, affected poet, whose celebrity is greater as the\r\nfriend and biographer of Gray, than even as the author of those verses\r\non the death of Lady Coventry, in which there are, nevertheless, some\r\nbeautiful lines. Gray died in college--a doom that, next to ending one's\r\ndays in a jail or a convent, seems the dreariest. He died of the gout: a\r\nsuitable, and, in that region and in those three-bottle days, almost an\r\ninevitable disease; but there is no record of his having been\r\nintemperate.\r\n\r\n[3: Gray migrated to Pembroke in 1756.]\r\n\r\nWhilst Gray was poring over dusty manuscripts, Horace was beginning that\r\ncareer of prosperity which was commenced by the keenest enjoyment of\r\nexistence. He has left us, in his Letters, some brilliant passages,\r\nindicative of the delights of his boyhood and youth. Like him, we linger\r\nover a period still fresh, still hopeful, still generous in impulse--\r\nstill strong in faith in the world's worth--before we hasten on to\r\nportray the man of the world, heartless, not wholly, perhaps, but wont\r\nto check all feeling till it was well-nigh quenched; little minded;\r\nbitter, if not spiteful; with many acquaintances and scarce one\r\nfriend--the Horace Walpole of Berkeley Square and Strawberry Hill.\r\n\r\n'Youthful passages of life are,' he says, 'the chippings of Pitt's\r\ndiamond, set into little heart-rings with mottoes; the stone itself more\r\nworth, the filings more gentle and agreeable. Alexander, at the head of\r\nthe world, never tasted the true pleasure that boys of his age have\r\nenjoyed at the head of a school. Little intrigues, little schemes and\r\npolicies engage their thoughts; and at the same time that they are\r\nlaying the foundation for their middle age of life, the mimic republic\r\nthey live in, furnishes materials of conversation for their latter age;\r\nand old men cannot be said to be children a second time with greater\r\ntruth from any one cause, than their living over again their childhood\r\nin imagination.'\r\n\r\nAgain: 'Dear George, were not the playing-fields at Eton food for all\r\nmanner of flights? No old maid's gown, though it had been tormented into\r\nall the fashions from King James to King George, ever underwent so many\r\ntransformations as these poor plains have in my idea. At first I was\r\ncontented with tending a visionary flock, and sighing some pastoral name\r\nto the echo of the cascade under the bridge ... As I got further into\r\nVirgil and Clelia, I found myself transported from Arcadia to the garden\r\nof Italy; and saw Windsor Castle in no other view than the _Capitoli\r\nimmobile saxum_.'\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole's humble friend Assheton was another of those Etonians\r\nwho were plodding on to independence, whilst he, set forward by fortune\r\nand interest, was accomplishing reputation. Assheton was the son of a\r\nworthy man, who presided over the Grammar School at Lancaster, upon a\r\nstipend of £32 a year. Assheton's mother had brought to her husband a\r\nsmall estate. This was sold to educate the 'boys:' they were both clever\r\nand deserving. One became the fellow of Trinity College; the other, the\r\nfriend of Horace, rose into notice as the tutor of the young Earl of\r\nPlymouth; then became a D.D., and a fashionable preacher in London; was\r\nelected preacher at Lincoln's Inn; attacked the Methodists; and died, at\r\nfifty-three, at variance with Horace--this Assheton, whom once he had\r\nloved so much.\r\n\r\nHorace, on the other hand, after having seen during his travels all that\r\nwas most exclusive, attractive, and lofty, both in art and nature, came\r\nhome without bringing, he declares, 'one word of French or Italian for\r\ncommon use.' He professed, indeed, to prefer England to all other\r\ncountries. A country tour in England delighted him: the populousness,\r\nthe ease in the people also, charmed him. 'Canterbury was a paradise to\r\nModena, Reggio, or Parma.' He had, before he returned, perceived that\r\nnowhere except in England was there the distinction of 'middling\r\npeople;' he now found that nowhere but in England were middling houses.\r\n'How snug they are!' exclaims this scion of the exclusives. Then he runs\r\non into an anecdote about Pope and Frederick, Prince of Wales. 'Mr.\r\nPope, said the prince, 'you don't love princes.' 'Sir, I beg your\r\npardon.' 'Well, you don't love kings, then.' 'Sir, I own I like the lion\r\nbetter before his claws are grown.' The 'Horace Walpole' began now to\r\ncreep out: never was he really at home except in a court atmosphere.\r\nStill he assumed, even at twenty-four, to be the boy.\r\n\r\n'You won't find me,' he writes to Harry Conway, 'much altered, I\r\nbelieve; at least, outwardly. I am not grown a bit shorter or fatter,\r\nbut am just the same long, lean creature as usual. Then I talk no French\r\nbut to my footman; nor Italian, but to myself. What inward alterations\r\nmay have happened to me you will discover best; for you know 'tis said,\r\none never knows that one's self. I will answer, that that part of it\r\nthat belongs to you has not suffered the least change--I took care of\r\nthat. For _virtu_, I have a little to entertain you--it is my sole\r\npleasure. I am neither young enough nor old enough to be in love.'\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it peeps out soon after that the 'Pomfrets' are coming\r\nback. Horace had known them in Italy. The Earl and Countess and their\r\ndaughters were just then the very pink of fashion; and even the leaders\r\nof all that was exclusive in the court. Half in ridicule, half in\r\nearnest, are the remarks which, throughout all the career of Horace,\r\nincessantly occur. 'I am neither young enough nor old enough to be in\r\nlove,' he says; yet that he was in love with one of the lovely Fermors\r\nis traditionary still in the family--and that tradition pointed at Lady\r\nJuliana, the youngest, afterwards married to Mr. Penn. The Earl of\r\nPomfret had been master of the horse to Queen Caroline: Lady Pomfret,\r\nlady of the bed-chamber. 'My Earl,' as the-countess styled him, was\r\napparently a supine subject to her ladyship's strong will and\r\nwrong-headed ability--which she, perhaps, inherited from her\r\ngrandfather, Judge Jeffreys; she being the daughter and heiress of that\r\nrash young Lord Jeffreys, who, in a spirit of braggadocia, stopped the\r\nfuneral of Dryden on its way to Westminster, promising a more splendid\r\nprocession than the poor, humble cortege--a boast which he never\r\nfulfilled. Lady Sophia Fermor, the eldest daughter, who afterwards\r\nbecame the wife of Lord Carteret, resembled, in beauty, the famed\r\nMistress Arabella Fermor, the heroine of the 'Rape of the Lock.' Horace\r\nWalpole admired Lady Sophia--whom he christened Juno--intensely.\r\nScarcely a letter drips from his pen--as a modern novelist used to\r\nexpress it[4]--without some touch of the Pomfrets. Thus to Sir Horace\r\nMann, then a diplomatist at Florence:--\r\n\r\n[4: The accomplished novelist, Mrs. Gore, famous for her facility, used\r\nto say that a three-volume novel just 'dripped from her pen.']\r\n\r\n'Lady Pomfret I saw last night. Lady Sophia has been ill with a cold;\r\nher head is to be dressed French, and her body English, for which I am\r\nsorry, her figure is so fine in a robe. She is full as sorry as I am.'\r\n\r\nAgain, at a ball at Sir Thomas Robinson's, where four-and-twenty couples\r\ndanced country-dances, in two sets, twelve and twelve, 'there was Lady\r\nSophia, handsomer than ever, but a little out of humour at the scarcity\r\nof minuets; however, as usual, dancing more than anybody, and, as usual\r\ntoo, she took out what men she liked, or thought the best\r\ndancers.'...'We danced; for I country-danced till four, then had tea and\r\ncoffee, and came home.' Poor Horace! Lady Sophia was not for a younger\r\nson, however gay, talented, or rich he might be.\r\n\r\nHis pique and resentment towards her mother, who had higher views for\r\nher beautiful daughter, begin at this period to show themselves, and\r\nnever died away.\r\n\r\nLady Townshend was the wit who used to gratify Horace with tales of her\r\nwhom he hated--Henrietta-Louisa, Countess of Pomfret.\r\n\r\n'Lady Townshend told me an admirable history: it is of _our friend_ Lady\r\nPomfret. Somebody that belonged to the Prince of Wales said, they were\r\ngoing to _court_; it was objected that they ought to say to Carlton\r\nHouse; that the only _court_ is where the king resides. Lady P., with\r\nher paltry air of significant learning and absurdity, said, \"Oh, Lord!\r\nIs there no _court_ in England but the king's? Sure, there are many\r\nmore! There is the _Court_ of Chancery, the _Court_ of Exchequer, the\r\n_Court_ of King's Bench, &c.\" Don't you love her? Lord Lincoln does her\r\ndaughter--Lady Sophia Fermor. He is come over, and met me and her the\r\nother night; he turned pale, spoke to her several times in the evening,\r\nbut not long, and sighed to me at going away. He came over all alone;\r\nand not only his Uncle Duke (the Duke of Newcastle) but even Majesty is\r\nfallen in love with him. He talked to the king at his levee, without\r\nbeing spoken to. That was always thought high treason; but I don't know\r\nhow the gruff gentleman liked it. And then he had been told that Lord\r\nLincoln designed to have made the campaign, if we had gone to war; in\r\nshort, he says Lord Lincoln is the handsomest man in England.'\r\n\r\nHorace was not, therefore, the only victim to a mother's ambition: there\r\nis something touching in the interest he from time to time evinces in\r\npoor Lord Lincoln's hopeless love. On another occasion, a second ball of\r\nSir Thomas Robinson's, Lord Lincoln, out of prudence, dances with Lady\r\nCaroline Fitzroy, Mr. Conway taking Lady Sophia Fermor. 'The two couple\r\nwere just admirably mismatched, as everybody soon perceived, by the\r\nattentions of each man to the woman he did not dance with, and the\r\nemulation of either lady; it was an admirable scene.'\r\n\r\nAll, however, was not country dancing: the young man, 'too old and too\r\nyoung to be in love,' was to make his way as a wit. He did so, in the\r\napproved way in that day of irreligion, in a political squib. On July\r\n14th, 1742, he writes in his Notes, 'I wrote the \"_Lessons for the\r\nDay_;\" the \"Lessons for the day\" being the first and second chapters of\r\nthe \"Book of Preferment,\"' Horace was proud of this _brochure_, for he\r\nsays it got about surreptitiously, and was 'the original of many things\r\nof that sort.' Various _jeux d'esprit_ of a similar sort followed. A\r\n'Sermon on Painting,' which was preached before Sir Robert Walpole, in\r\nthe gallery at Houghton, by his chaplain; 'Patapan, or the Little White\r\nDog,' imitated from La Fontaine. No. 38 of the 'Old England Journal,'\r\nintended to ridicule Lord Bath; and then, in a magazine, was printed his\r\n'Scheme for a Tax on Message Cards and Notes.' Next the 'Beauties,'\r\nwhich was also handed about, and got into print. So that without the\r\nvulgarity of publishing, the reputation of the dandy writer was soon\r\nnoised about. His religious tenets may or may not have been sound; but\r\nat all events the tone of his mind assumed at this time a very different\r\ncharacter to that reverent strain in which, when a youth at college, he\r\nhad apostrophized those who bowed their heads beneath the vaulted roof\r\nof King's College, in his eulogium in the character of Henry VI.\r\n\r\n  'Ascend the temple, join the vocal choir,\r\n  Let harmony your raptured souls inspire.\r\n  Hark how the tuneful, solemn organs blow,\r\n  Awfully strong, elaborately slow;\r\n  Now to you empyrean seats above\r\n  Raise meditation on the wings of love.\r\n  Now falling, sinking, dying to the moan\r\n  Once warbled sad by Jesse's contrite son;\r\n  Breathe in each note a conscience through the sense,\r\n  And call forth tears from soft-eyed Penitence.'\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all his gaieties, his successes, and perhaps his hopes,\r\na cloud hovered over the destinies of his father. The opposition, Horace\r\nsaw, in 1741, wished to ruin his father 'by ruining his constitution.'\r\nThey wished to continue their debates on Saturdays, Sir Robert's only\r\nday of rest, when he used to rush to Richmond New Park, there to amuse\r\nhimself with a favourite pack of beagles. Notwithstanding the minister's\r\nindifference to this his youngest son, Horace felt bitterly what he\r\nconsidered a persecution against one of the most corrupt of modern\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\n'Trust me, if we fall, all the grandeur, all the envied grandeur of our\r\nhouse, will not cost me a sigh: it has given me no pleasure while we\r\nhave it, and will give me no pain when I part with it. My liberty, my\r\nease, and choice of my own friends and company, will sufficiently\r\ncounterbalance the crowds of Downing Street. I am so sick of it all,\r\nthat if we are victorious or not, I propose leaving England in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was not destined to last long. Sir Robert was forced to\r\ngive up the contest and be shelved with a peerage. In 1742, he was\r\ncreated Earl of Orford, and resigned. The wonder is that, with a mortal\r\ninternal disease to contend with, he should have faced his foes so long.\r\nVerses ascribed to Lord Hervey ended, as did all the squibs of the day,\r\nwith a fling at that 'rogue Walpole.'\r\n\r\n  'For though you have made that rogue Walpole retire,\r\n  You are out of the frying-pan into the fire:\r\n  But since to the Protestant line I'm a friend,\r\n  I tremble to think how these changes may end.'\r\n\r\nHorace, notwithstanding an affected indifference, felt his father's\r\ndownfall poignantly. He went, indeed, to court, in spite of a cold,\r\ntaken in an unaired house; for the prime minister now quitted Downing\r\nStreet for Arlington Street. The court was crowded, he found, with old\r\nladies, the wives of patriots who had not been there for 'these twenty\r\nyears,' and who appeared in the accoutrements that were in vogue in\r\nQueen Anne's time. 'Then', he writes, 'the joy and awkward jollity of\r\nthem is inexpressible! They titter, and, wherever you meet them, are\r\nalways looking at their watches an hour before the time. I met several\r\non the birthday (for I did not arrive time enough to make clothes), and\r\nthey were dressed in all the colours of the rainbow. They seem to have\r\nsaid to themselves, twenty years ago, \"Well, if ever I do go to court\r\nagain, I will have a pink and silver, or a blue and silver;\" and they\r\nkeep their resolutions.'\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic anecdote betrays his ill-suppressed vexation:--\r\n\r\n'I laughed at myself prodigiously the other day for a piece of absence.\r\nI was writing, on the king's birthday, and being disturbed with the mob\r\nin the street, I rang for the porter and with an air of grandeur, as if\r\nI was still at Downing Street, cried, \"Pray send away those marrow-bones\r\nand cleavers.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow, with the most mortified air in the world, replied,\r\n\"Sir, they are not at _our_ door, but over the way, at my Lord\r\nCarteret's.\"--\"Oh!\" said I, \"then let them alone; may be, he does not\r\ndislike the noise!\" I pity the poor porter, who sees all his old\r\ncustomers going over the way too.'\r\n\r\nThe retirement of Sir Robert from office had an important effect on the\r\ntastes and future life of his son Horace. The minister had been\r\noccupying his later years in pulling down his old ancestral house at\r\nHoughton, and in building an enormous mansion, which has since his time\r\nbeen, in its turn, partially demolished. When Harley, Earl of Orford,\r\nwas known to be erecting a great house for himself, Sir Robert had\r\nremarked that a minister who did so committed a great imprudence. When\r\nHoughton was begun, Sir Hynde Aston reminded Sir Robert of this speech.\r\n'You ought to have recalled it to me before,' was the reply; 'for before\r\nI began building, it might have been of use to me.'\r\n\r\nThis famous memorial of Walpolean greatness, this splendid folly,\r\nconstructed, it is generally supposed, on public money, was inhabited by\r\nSir Robert only ten days in summer, and twenty days in winter; in the\r\nautumn, during the shooting season, two months. It became almost an\r\neyesore to the quiet gentry, who viewed the palace with a feeling of\r\ntheir own inferiority. People as good as the Walpoles lived in their\r\ngable-ended, moderate-sized mansions; and who was Sir Robert, to set\r\nthem at so immense a distance?\r\n\r\nTo the vulgar comprehension of the Premier, Houghton, gigantic in its\r\nproportions, had its purposes. He there assembled his supporters; there,\r\nfor a short time, he entertained his constituents and coadjutors with a\r\nmagnificent, jovial hospitality, of which he, with his gay spirits, his\r\nhumourous, indelicate jokes, and his unbounded good-nature, was the very\r\nsoul. Free conversation, hard-drinking, were the features of every day's\r\nfeast. Pope thus describes him:--\r\n\r\n  'Seen him, I have, but in his happier hour,\r\n  Of social pleasure, ill exchanged for power;\r\n  Seen him uncumbered with the venal tribe,\r\n  Smile without art, and win without a bribe.'\r\n\r\nAmid the coarse taste one gentle refinement existed: this was the love\r\nof gardening, both in its smaller compass and it its nobler sense of\r\nlandscape gardening. 'This place,' Sir Robert, in 1743, wrote to General\r\nChurchill, from Houghton, 'affords no news, no subject of entertainment\r\nor amusement; for fine men of wit and pleasure about town understand\r\nneither the language and taste, nor the pleasure of the inanimate world.\r\nMy flatterers here are all mutes: the oaks, the beeches, the chestnuts,\r\nseem to contend which best shall please the lord of the manor. They\r\ncannot deceive; they will not lie. I in sincerity admire them, and have\r\nas many beauties about me as fill up all my hours of dangling, and no\r\ndisgrace attending me, from sixty-seven years of age. Within doors we\r\ncome a little nearer to real life, and admire, upon the almost speaking\r\ncanvas, all the airs and graces the proudest ladies can boast.'\r\n\r\nIn these pursuits Horace cordially shared. Through his agency, Horace\r\nMann, still in the diplomatic service, at Florence, selected and\r\npurchased works of art, which were sent either to Arlington Street, or\r\nto form the famous Houghton Collection, to which Horace so often refers\r\nin that delightful work, his 'Anecdotes of Painting.'\r\n\r\nAmongst the embellishments of Houghton, the gardens were the most\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\n'Sir Robert has pleased himself,' Pulteney, Earl of Bath, wrote, 'with\r\nerecting palaces and extending parks, planting gardens in places to\r\nwhich the very earth was to be transported in carriages, and embracing\r\ncascades and fountains whose water was only to be obtained by aqueducts\r\nand machines, and imitating the extravagance of Oriental monarchs, at\r\nthe expense of a free people whom he has at once impoverished and\r\nbetrayed.'\r\n\r\nThe ex-minister went to a great expense in the cultivation of plants,\r\nbought Uvedale's 'Hortus Siccus;' and received from Bradley, the\r\nProfessor of Botany at Cambridge, the tribute of a dedication, in which\r\nit was said that 'Sir Robert had purchased one of the finest collections\r\nof plants in the kingdom.'\r\n\r\nWhat was more to his honour still, was Sir Robert's preservation of St.\r\nJames's Park for the people. Fond of outdoor amusements himself, the\r\nPremier heard, with dismay, a proposal on the part of Queen Caroline to\r\nconvert that ancient park into a palace garden. 'She asked my father,'\r\nHorace Walpole relates, 'what the alteration might possibly\r\ncost?'--_Only three crowns_' was the civil, witty, candid answer. The\r\nqueen was wise enough to take the hint. It is possible she meant to\r\nconvert the park into gardens that should be open to the public as at\r\nBerlin, Mannheim, and even the Tuileries. Still it would not have been\r\nours.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole owed, perhaps, his love of architecture and his taste for\r\ngardening, partly to the early companionship of Gray, who delighted in\r\nthose pursuits. Walpole's estimation of pictures, medals, and statues,\r\nwas however the fruit of a long residence abroad. We are apt to rail at\r\ncontinental nations; yet had it not been for the occasional intercourse\r\nwith foreign nations, art would have altogether died out among us. To\r\nthe 'Grandes Tours,' performed as a matter of course by our young\r\nnobility in the most impressionable period of their lives we owe most of\r\nour noble private collections. Charles I. and Buckingham, renewed, in\r\ntheir travels in Spain, the efforts previously made by Lord Arundel and\r\nLord Pembroke, to embellish their country seats. Then came the\r\nRebellion; and like a mighty rushing river, made a chasm in which much\r\nperished. Art languished in the reign of the second Charles, excepting\r\nin what related to portrait painting. Evelyn stood almost alone in his\r\nthen secluded and lovely retirement at Wotton; apart in his undying\r\nexertions still to arrest the Muses ere they quitted for ever English\r\nshores. Then came the deadly frost of William's icy influence. The reign\r\nof Anne was conspicuous more for letters than for art: architecture,\r\nmore especially, was vulgarized under Vanbrugh. George I. had no\r\nconception of anything abstract: taste, erudition, science, art, were\r\nlike a dead language to his common sense, his vulgar profligacy, and his\r\npersonal predilections. Neither George II. nor his queen had an iota of\r\ntaste, either in language, conduct, literature, or art. To be vulgar,\r\nwas _haut-ton;_ to be refined, to have pursuits that took one from low\r\nparty gossip, or heterodox disquisitions upon party, was esteemed odd:\r\neverything original was cramped; everything imaginative was sneered at;\r\nthe enthusiasm that is elevated by religion was unphilosophic; the\r\npoetry that is breathed out from the works of genius was not\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\nIt was at Houghton, under the roof of that monster palace, that Horace\r\nWalpole indulged that tastes for pictures which he had acquired in\r\nItaly. His chief coadjutor, however, as far as the antiquities of\r\npainting are concerned, was George Vertue, the eminent engraver. Vertue\r\nwas a man of modest merit, and was educated merely as an engraver; but,\r\nconscious of talent, studied drawing, which he afterwards applied to\r\nengraving. He was patronised both by the vain Godfrey Kneller and by the\r\nintellectual Lord Somers: yet his works have more fidelity than\r\nelegance, and betray in every line the antiquary rather than the genius.\r\nVertue was known to be a first-rate authority as to the history of a\r\npainter; he was admitted and welcomed into every great country house in\r\nEngland; he lived in an atmosphere of vertù; every line a dilettante\r\ncollector wrote, every word he uttered, was minuted down by him; he\r\nvisited every collection of rarities; he copied every paper he could\r\nfind relative to art; registers of wills, and registers of parishes, for\r\nbirths and deaths were his delight; sales his recreation. He was the\r\n'Old Mortality' of pictures in this country. No wonder that his\r\ncompilations were barely contained in forty volumes, which he left in\r\nmanuscript. Human nature has singular varieties: here was a man who\r\nexpended his very existence in gathering up the works of others, and\r\ndied without giving to the world one of his own. But Horace Walpole has\r\ndone him justice. After Vertue's death he bought his manuscripts from\r\nhis widow. In one of his pocket-books was contained the whole history of\r\nthis man of one idea: Vertue began his collection in 1713, and worked at\r\nit until his death in 1757, forty-four years.\r\n\r\nHe died in the belief that he should one day publish an unique work on\r\npainting and painters: such was the aim of his existence, and his study\r\nmust have been even more curious than the wonderfully crammed, small\r\nhouse at Islington, where William Upcott, the 'Old Mortality' in his\r\nline, who saved from the housemaid's fire-lighting designs the MSS. Of\r\nEvelyn's\r\n\r\nLife and Letters, which he found tossing about in the old gallery at\r\nWotton, near Dorking, passed his days. Like Upcott, like Palissy, Vertue\r\nlived and died under the influence of one isolated aim, effort, and\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nIn these men, the cherished and amiable monomania of gifted minds was\r\nrealized. Upcott had every possible autograph from every known hand in\r\nhis collection: Palissy succeeded in making glazed china; but Vertue\r\nleft his ore to the hands of others to work out into shape, and the man\r\nwho moulded his crude materials was Horace Walpole, and Vertue's forty\r\nvolumes were shaped into a readable work, as curious and accurate in\r\nfacts as it is flippant and prejudiced in style and opinions.\r\n\r\nWalpole's 'Anecdotes of Painting' are the foundation of all our small\r\namount of knowledge as to what England has done formerly to encourage\r\nart.\r\n\r\nOne may fancy the modest, ingenious George Vertue arranging first, and\r\nthen making a catalogue of the Houghton Gallery; Horace, a boy still, in\r\nlooks,--with a somewhat chubby face, admiring and following: Sir Robert,\r\nin a cocked hat, edged with silver lace, a curled short wig, a loose\r\ncoat, also edged with silver lace, and with a half humorous expression\r\non his vulgar countenance, watching them at intervals, as they paraded\r\nthrough the hall, a large square space, adorned with bas-reliefs and\r\nbusts, and containing a bronze copy of the Laocoon, for which Sir Robert\r\n(or rather we English) paid a thousand pounds; or they might be seen\r\nhopping speedily through the ground-floor apartments where there could\r\nbe little to arrest the footsteps of the mediaeval-minded Vertue. Who\r\nbut a courtier could give one glance at a portrait of George I., though\r\nby Kneller? Who that _was_ a courtier in that house would pause to look\r\nat the resemblance, also by Kneller, of the short-lived, ill-used\r\nCatherine Shorter, the Premier's first wife--even though he still\r\nendured it in his bed-room? a mute reproach for his neglect and\r\nmisconduct. So let us hasten to the yellow dining-room where presently\r\nwe may admire the works of Titian, Guido, Vanderwerf, and last, not\r\nleast, eleven portraits by Vandyck, of the Wharton family, which Sir\r\nRobert bought at the sale of the spendthrift Duke of Wharton.\r\n\r\nThen let us glance at the saloon, famed for the four large 'Market\r\nPieces,' as they were called, by Rubens and Snyders: let us lounge into\r\nwhat were called the Carlo Maratti and the Vandyck rooms; step we also\r\ninto the green velvet bed-chamber, the tapestry-room, the worked bed\r\nchamber; then comes another dining-room: in short, we are lost in wonder\r\nat this noble collection, which cost £40,000.\r\n\r\nMany of the pictures were selected and bargained for by Vertue, who, in\r\nFlanders, purchased the Market Pieces referred to, for £428; but did not\r\nsecure the 'Fish Market,' and the 'Meat Market,' by the same painter. In\r\naddition to the pictures, the stateliness and beauty of the rooms were\r\nenhanced by rich furniture, carving, gilding, and all the subsidiary\r\narts which our grandfathers loved to add to high merit in design or\r\ncolouring. Besides his purchases, Sir Robert received presents of\r\npictures from friends, and expectant courtiers; and the gallery at\r\nHoughton contained at last 222 pictures. To our sorrow now, to our\r\ndisgrace then, this splendid collection was suffered to go out of the\r\ncountry: Catherine, empress of Russia, bought it for £40,000, and it\r\nadorns the Hermitage Palace of St. Petersburgh.\r\n\r\nAfter Sir Robert's retirement from power, the good qualities which he\r\nundoubtedly possessed, seemed to re-appear as soon as the pressure of\r\nparty feeling was withdrawn. He was fast declining in health when the\r\ninsurrection of 1745 was impending. He had warned the country of its\r\ndanger in his last speech, one of the finest ever made in the House of\r\nLords: after that effort his voice was heard no more. The gallant,\r\nunfortunate Charles Edward was then at Paris, and that scope of old\r\nexperience\r\n\r\n  ----'which doth attain\r\n  To somewhat of prophetic strain,'\r\n\r\nshowed the ex-minister of Great Britain that an invasion was at hand. It\r\nwas on this occasion that Frederick, Prince of Wales, took Sir Robert,\r\nthen Lord Orford, by the hand, and thanked him for his zeal in the cause\r\nof the royal family. Walpole returned to Norfolk, but was summoned again\r\nto London to afford the ministry the benefit of his counsels. Death,\r\nhowever, closed his prosperous, but laborious life. He suffered agonies\r\nfrom the stone; large doses of opium kept him in a state of stupor, and\r\nalone gave him ease; but his strength failed, and he was warned to\r\nprepare himself for his decease. He bore the announcement with great\r\nfortitude, and took leave of his children in perfect resignation to his\r\ndoom. He died on the 28th of March, 1745.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole--whatsoever doubts may rest on the fact of his being Lord\r\nOrford's son or not--writes feelingly and naturally upon this event, and\r\nits forerunner, the agonies of disease. He seems, from the following\r\npassages in his letters to Sir Horace Mann, to have devoted himself\r\nincessantly to the patient invalid: on his father having rallied, he\r\nthus expresses himself:--\r\n\r\n'You have heard from your brother the reason of my not having written to\r\nyou so long. I have been out but twice since my father fell into this\r\nillness, which is now near a month, and all that time either continually\r\nin his room, or obliged to see multitudes of people: for it is wonderful\r\nhow everybody of all kinds has affected to express their concern for\r\nhim! He has been out of danger this week; but I can't say he mended at\r\nall perceptibly till these last three days. His spirits are amazing, and\r\nhis constitution more, for Dr. Hulse said honestly from the first, that\r\nif he recovered it would be from his own strength, not from their art.\r\nHow much more,' he adds, mournfully, 'he will ever recover, one scarce\r\ndare hope about; for us, he is greatly recovered; for himself--' He then\r\nbreaks off.\r\n\r\nA month after we find him thus referring to the parent still throbbing\r\nin mortal agony on the death-bed, with no chance of amendment:--\r\n\r\n'How dismal a prospect for him, with the possession of the greatest\r\nunderstanding in the world, not the least impaired, to lie without any\r\nuse for it! for to keep him from pains and restlessness, he takes so\r\nmuch opiate, that he is scarce awake four hours of the four-and-twenty;\r\nbut I will say no more of this.'\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of March, he again wrote to his friend in the following\r\nterms:--\r\n\r\n'I begged your brothers to tell you what it is impossible for me to tell\r\nyou. You share in our common loss! Don't expect me to enter at all upon\r\nthe subject. After the melancholy two months that I have passed, and in\r\nmy situation, you will not wonder I shun a conversation which could not\r\nbe bounded by a letter, a letter that would grow into a panegyric or a\r\npiece of a moral; improper for me to write upon, and too distressful for\r\nus both! a death is only to be felt, never to be talked upon by those it\r\ntouches.'\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the world soon had Horace Walpole for her own again;\r\nduring Lord Orford's last illness, George II. Thought of him, it seems,\r\neven though the 'Granvilles' were the only people tolerated at court.\r\nThat famous _clique_ comprised the secretly adored of Horace (Lady\r\nGranville now), Lady Sophia Fermor.\r\n\r\n'The Granville faction,' Horace wrote, before his father's death, 'are\r\nstill the constant and only countenanced people at court. Lord\r\nWinchelsea, one of the disgraced, played at court at Twelfth-night, and\r\nwon; the king asked him next morning how much he had for his own share.\r\nHe replied, \"Sir, about a quarter's salary.\" I liked the spirit, and was\r\ntalking to him of it the next night at Lord Granville's. \"Why yes,\" said\r\nhe, \"I think it showed familiarity at least: tell it your father, I\r\ndon't think he will dislike it.\"'\r\n\r\nThe most trifling incidents divided the world of fashion and produced\r\nthe bitterest rancour. Indeed, nothing could exceed the frivolity of the\r\ngreat, except their impertinence. For want of better amusements, it had\r\nbecome the fashion to make conundrums, and to have printed books full of\r\nthem, which were produced at parties. But these were peaceful\r\ndiversions. The following anecdote is worthy of the times of George II.\r\nand of Frederick of Wales:--\r\n\r\n'There is a very good quarrel,' Horace writes, 'on foot, between two\r\nduchesses: she of Queensberry sent to invite Lady Emily Lenox to a ball:\r\nher grace of Richmond, who is wonderfully cautious since Lady Caroline's\r\nelopement (with Mr. Fox), sent word \"she could not determine.\" The other\r\nsent again the same night: the same answer. The Queensberry then sent\r\nword, that she had made up her company, and desired to be excused from\r\nhaving Lady Emily's; but at the bottom of the card wrote, \"Too great\r\ntrust.\" There is no declaration of war come out from the other duchess:\r\nbut I believe it will be made a national quarrel of the whole\r\nillegitimate royal family.'\r\n\r\nHer Grace of Queensberry, Prior's 'Kitty, beautiful and young,' lorded\r\nit, with a tyrannical hand, over the court. Her famed loveliness was, it\r\nis true, at this time on the wane. Her portrait delineating her in her\r\nbib and tucker, with her head rolled back underneath a sort of half cap,\r\nhalf veil, shows how intellectual was the face to which such incense was\r\npaid for years. Her forehead and eyebrows are beautiful: her eyes soft\r\nthough lively in expression: her features refined. She was as whimsical\r\nin her attire as in her character. When, however, she chose to appear as\r\nthe _grande dame_, no one could cope with her, Mrs. Delany describes her\r\nat the Birth-day,--her dress of white satin, embroidered with vine\r\nleaves, convolvuluses, rose-buds, shaded after nature; but she, says her\r\nfriend, 'was _so far_ beyond the master-_piece of art_ that one could\r\nhardly think of her clothes--allowing for her age I never saw so\r\n_beautiful a creature_.'\r\n\r\nMeantime, Houghton was shut up: for its owner died £50,000 in debt, and\r\nthe elder brother of Horace, the second Lord Orford, proposed, on\r\nentering it again, after keeping it closed for some time, to enter upon\r\n'new, and then very unknown economy, for which there was great need:'\r\nthus Horace refers to the changes.\r\n\r\nIt was in the South Sea scheme that Sir Robert Walpole had realized a\r\nlarge sum of money, by selling out at the right moment. In doing so he\r\nhad gained 1000 per cent. But he left little to his family, and at his\r\ndeath, Horace received a legacy only of £5,000, and a thousand pounds\r\nyearly, which he was to draw (for doing nothing) from the collector's\r\nplace in the Custom House; the surplus to be divided between his brother\r\nEdward and himself: this provision was afterwards enhanced by some money\r\nwhich came to Horace and his brothers from his uncle Captain Shorter's\r\nproperty; but Horace was not at this period a rich man, and perhaps his\r\nnot marrying was owing to his dislike of fortune-hunting, or to his\r\ndread of refusal.\r\n\r\nTwo years after his father's death, he took a small house at Twickenham:\r\nthe property cost him nearly £14,000; in the deeds he found that it was\r\ncalled Strawberry Hill. He soon commenced making considerable additions\r\nto the house--which became a sort of raree-show in the latter part of\r\nthe last, and until a late period in this, century.\r\n\r\nTwickenham--so called, according to the antiquary Norden, because the\r\nThames, as it flows near it, seems from the islands to be divided into\r\ntwo rivers,--had long been celebrated for its gardens, when Horace\r\nWalpole, the generalissimo of all bachelors, took Strawberry Hill.\r\n'Twicknam is as much as Twynam,' declares Norden, 'a place scytuate\r\nbetween two rivers.' So fertile a locality could not be neglected by the\r\nmonks of old, the great gardeners and tillers of land in ancient days;\r\nand the Manor of Twickenham was consequently given to the monks of\r\nChrist Church, Canterbury, by King Edred, in 491; who piously inserted\r\nhis anathema against any person--whatever their rank, sex, or order--who\r\nshould infringe the rights of these holy men. 'May their memory,' the\r\nking decreed, with a force worthy of the excommunicator-wholesale, Pius\r\nIX., 'be blotted out of the Book of Life; may their strength continually\r\nwaste away, and be there no restorative to repair it!' nevertheless,\r\nthere were in the time of Lysons, a hundred and fifty acres of\r\nfruit-gardens at Twickenham: the soil being a sandy loam, raspberries\r\ngrew plentifully. Even so early as Queen Elizabeth's days, Bishop\r\nCorbet's father had a nursery garden at Twickenham,--so that King\r\nEdred's curse seems to have fallen as powerlessly as it may be hoped all\r\nsubsequent maledictions may do.\r\n\r\nIn 1698, one of the Earl of Bradford's coachmen built a small house on a\r\npiece of ground, called in old works, Strawberry-Hill-Shot; lodgings\r\nwere here let, and Colley Cibber became one of the occupants of the\r\nplace, and here wrote his Comedy called 'Refusal; or the Ladies'\r\nPhilosophy.' The spot was so greatly admired that Talbot, Bishop of\r\nDurham, lived eight years in it, and the Marquis of Carnarvon succeeded\r\nhim as a tenant: next came Mrs. Chenevix, a famous toy-woman. She was\r\nprobably a French woman, for Father Courayer--he who vainly endeavoured\r\nto effect an union between the English and the Gallican churches--lodged\r\nhere some time. Horace Walpole bought up Mrs. Chenevix's lease, and\r\nafterwards the fee-simple; and henceforth became the busiest, if not the\r\nhappiest, man in a small way in existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRAWBERRY HILL FROM THE THAMES.]\r\n\r\nWe now despise the poor, over-ornate miniature Gothic style of\r\nStrawberry Hill; we do not consider with what infinite pains the\r\nstructure was enlarged into its final and well-known form. In the first\r\nplace, Horace made a tour to collect models from the chief cathedral\r\ncities in England; but the building required twenty-three years to\r\ncomplete it. It was begun in 1753, and finished in 1776. Strawberry Hill\r\nhad one merit, everything was in keeping: the internal decorations, the\r\nscreens, the niches, the chimney-pieces, the book-shelves, were all\r\nGothic; and most of these were designed by Horace himself; and, indeed,\r\nthe description of Strawberry Hill is too closely connected with the\r\nannals of his life to be dissevered from his biography. Here he gathered\r\nup his mental forces to support and amuse himself during a long life,\r\nsometimes darkened by spleen, but rarely by solitude; for Horace, with\r\nmuch isolation of the heart, was, to the world, a social being.\r\n\r\nWhat scandal, what trifles, what important events, what littleness of\r\nmind, yet what stretch of intellect were henceforth issued by the\r\nrecluse of Strawberry, as he plumed himself on being styled, from that\r\nlibrary of 'Strawberry!' Let us picture to ourselves the place, the\r\npersons--put on, if we can, the sentiments and habits of the retreat;\r\nlook through its loopholes, not only on the wide world beyond, but into\r\nthe small world within; and face the fine gentleman author in every\r\nperiod of his varied life.\r\n\r\n'The Strawberry Gazette,' Horace once wrote to a fine and titled lady,\r\n'is very barren of weeds.' Such, however, was rarely the case. Peers,\r\nand still better, peeresses,--politicians, actors, actresses,--the poor\r\npoet who knew not where to dine, the Maecenas who was 'fed with\r\ndedications'--the belle of the season, the demirep of many, the\r\nantiquary, and the dilettanti,--painters, sculptors, engravers, all\r\nbrought news to the 'Strawberry Gazette;' and incense, sometimes wrung\r\nfrom aching hearts, to the fastidious wit who professed to be a judge of\r\nall material and immaterial things--from a burlesque to an Essay on\r\nhistory or Philosophy--from the construction of Mrs. Chenevix's last new\r\ntoy to the mechanism of a clock made in the sixteenth century, was\r\nlavished there.\r\n\r\nSuppose that it is noon-day: Horace is showing a party of guests from\r\nLondon over Strawberry:--enter we with him, and let us stand in the\r\ngreat parlour before a portrait by Wright of the Minister to whom all\r\ncourts bowed. 'That is my father, Sir Robert, in profile,' and a vulgar\r\nface in profile is always seen at its vulgarest; and the\r\n_nex-retroussé,_ the coarse mouth, the double chin, are most forcibly\r\nexhibited in this limning by Wright; who did not, like Reynolds, or like\r\nLawrence, cast a _nuance_ of gentility over every subject of his pencil.\r\nHorace--can we not hear him in imagination?--is telling his friends how\r\nSir Robert used to celebrate the day on which he sent in his\r\nresignation, as a fête; then he would point out to his visitors a\r\nConversation-piece, one of Reynolds's earliest efforts in small life,\r\nrepresenting the second Earl of Edgecumbe, Selwyn, and Williams---all\r\nwits and beaux, and _habitués_ of Strawberry. Colley Cibber, however,\r\nwas put in cold marble in the anteroom; a respect very _Horatian_, for\r\nno man knew better how to rank his friends than the recluse of\r\nStrawberry. He hurries the lingering guests through the little parlour,\r\nthe chimneypiece of which was copied from the tomb of Ruthall, Bishop of\r\nDurham, in Westminster Abbey. Yet how he pauses complacently to\r\nenumerate what has been done for him by titled belles: how these dogs,\r\nmodelled in terra-cotta, are the production of Anne Darner; a\r\nwater-colour drawing by Agnes Berry; a landscape with gipsies by Lady Di\r\nBeauclerk;--all platonically devoted to our Horace; but he dwells long,\r\nand his bright eyes are lighted up as he pauses before a case, looking\r\nas if it contained only a few apparently faded, of no-one-knows-who (or\r\nby whom) miniatures; this is a collection of Peter Oliver's best\r\nworks--portraits of the Digby family.\r\n\r\nHow sadly, in referring to these invaluable pictures, does one's mind\r\nrevert to the day when, before the hammer of Robins had resounded in\r\nthese rooms--before his transcendent eloquence had been heard at\r\nStrawberry--Agnes Strickland, followed by all eyes, pondered over that\r\ngroup of portraits: how, as she slowly withdrew, we of the commonalty\r\nscarce worthy to look, gathered around the spot again, and wondered at\r\nthe perfect life, the perfect colouring, proportion, and keeping of\r\nthose tiny vestiges of a bygone generation!\r\n\r\nThen Horace--we fear it was not till his prime was past, and a touch of\r\ngout crippled his once active limbs--points to a picture of Rose, the\r\ngardener (well named), presenting Charles II. with a pine-apple. Some\r\nmay murmur a doubt whether pine-apples were cultivated in cold Britain\r\nso long since. But Horace enforces the fact; 'the likeness of the king,'\r\nquoth he, 'is too marked, and his features are too well known to doubt\r\nthe fact;' and then he tells 'how he had received a present the last\r\nSunday of fruit--and from whom.'\r\n\r\nThey pause next on Sir Peter Lely's portrait of Cowley--next on\r\nHogarth's Sarah Malcolm, the murderess of her mistress; then--and\r\ndoubtless, the spinster ladies are in fault here for the delay,--on Mrs.\r\nDamer's model of two kittens, pets, though, of Horace Walpole's--for he\r\nwho loved few human beings was, after the fashion of bachelors, fond of\r\ncats.\r\n\r\nThey ascend the staircase: the domestic adornments merge into the\r\nhistoric. We have Francis I.--not himself, but his armour: the\r\nchimneypiece, too, is a copy from the tomb-works of John, Earl of\r\nCornwall, in Westminster Abbey; the stonework from that of Thomas, Duke\r\nof Clarence, at Canterbury.\r\n\r\nStay awhile: we have not done with sacrilege yet; worse things are to be\r\ntold, and we walk with consciences not unscathed into the Library,\r\ndisapproving in secret but flattering vocally. Here the very spirit of\r\nHorace seemed to those who visited Strawberry before its fall to breathe\r\nin every corner. Alas! when we beheld that library, it was half filled\r\nwith chests containing the celebrated MSS. of his letters; which were\r\nbought by that enterprising publisher of learned name, Richard Bentley,\r\nand which have since had adequate justice done them by first-rate\r\neditors. There they were: the 'Strawberry Gazette' in full;--one glanced\r\nmerely at the yellow paper, and clear, decisive hand, and then turned to\r\nsee what objects he, who loved his books so well, collected for his\r\nespecial gratification. Mrs. Damer again! how proud he was of her\r\ngenius--her beauty, her cousinly love for himself; the wise way in which\r\nshe bound up the wounds of her breaking heart when her profligate\r\nhusband shot himself, by taking to occupation--perhaps, too, by liking\r\ncousin Horace indifferently well. He put her models forward in every\r\nplace. Here was her Osprey Eagle in terra-cotta, a masterly production;\r\nthere a _couvre-fire,_ or _cur-few,_ imitated and modelled by her. Then\r\nthe marriage of Henry VI. Figures on the wall; near the fire is a screen\r\nof the first tapestry ever made in England, representing a map of Surrey\r\nand Middlesex; a notion of utility combined with ornament, which we see\r\nstill exhibited in the Sampler in old-fashioned, middle-class houses;\r\nthat poor posthumous, base-born child of the tapestry, almost defunct\r\nitself; and a veritable piece of antiquity.\r\n\r\nStill more remarkable in this room was a quaint-faced clock, silver\r\ngilt, given by Henry VIII. to Anne Boleyn; which perchance, after\r\nmarking the moments of her festive life, struck unfeelingly the hour of\r\nher doom.\r\n\r\nBut the company are hurrying into a little ante-room, the ceiling of\r\nwhich is studded with stars in mosaic; it is therefore called jocularly,\r\nthe 'Star Chamber;' and here stands a cast of the famous bust of Henry\r\nVII., by Torregiano, intended for the tomb of that sad-faced,\r\nlong-visaged monarch, who always looks as if royalty had disagreed with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNext we enter the Holbein Chamber. Horace hated bishops and archbishops,\r\nand all the hierarchy; yet here again we behold another prelatical\r\nchimneypiece--a frieze taken from the tomb of Archbishop Warham, at\r\nCanterbury. And here, in addition to Holbein's picture of Mary Tudor,\r\nDuchess of Suffolk, and of her third husband Adrian Stokes, are Vertue's\r\ncopies of Holbein, drawings of that great master's pictures in\r\nBuckingham House: enough--let us hasten into the Long Gallery. Those who\r\nremember Sir Samuel Merrick and his Gallery at Goodrich Court will have\r\ntraced in his curious, somewhat gew gaw collections of armour,\r\nantiquities, faded portraits, and mock horses, much of the taste and\r\nturn of mind that existed in Horace Walpole.\r\n\r\nThe gallery, which all who recollect the sale at Strawberry Hill must\r\nremember with peculiar interest, sounded well on paper. It was 56 feet\r\nlong, 17 high, and 13 wide; yet was neither long enough, high enough,\r\nnor wide enough to inspire the indefinable sentiment by which we\r\nacknowledge vastness. We beheld it the scene of George Robins's\r\ntriumphs--crowded to excess. Here strolled Lord John Russell; there,\r\nwith heavy tread, walked Daniel O'Connell. Hallam, placid, kindly,\r\ngentle--the prince of book-worms--moved quickly through the rooms,\r\npausing to raise a glance to the ceiling--copied from one of the side\r\naisles of Henry VII.'s Chapel--but the fretwork is gilt, and there is\r\n_petitesse_ about the Gothic which disappoints all good judges.\r\n\r\nBut when Horace conducted his courtly guests into this his mind-vaunted\r\nvaulted gallery, he had sometimes George Selwyn at his side; or\r\nGray--or, in his old age, 'my niece, the Duchess of Gloucester,' leaned\r\non his arm. What strange associations, what brilliant company!--the\r\nassociations can never be recalled there again; nor the company\r\nreassembled. The gallery, like everything else, has perished under the\r\npressure of debt. He who was so particular, too, as to the number of\r\nthose who were admitted to see his house--he who stipulated that four\r\npersons only should compose a party, and one party alone be shown over\r\neach day--how would he have borne the crisis, could he have foreseen it,\r\nwhen Robins became, for the time, his successor, and was the temporary\r\nlord of Strawberry; the dusty, ruthless, wondering, depreciating mob of\r\nbrokers--the respectable host of publishers--the starving army of\r\nmartyrs, the authors--the fine ladies, who saw nothing there comparable\r\nto Howell and James's--the antiquaries, fishing out suspicious\r\nantiquities--the painters, clamorous over Kneller's profile of Mrs.\r\nBarry--the virtuous indignant mothers, as they passed by the portraits\r\nof the Duchess de la Valliere, and of Ninon de l'Enclos, and remarked,\r\nor at all events they _might_ have remarked, that the company on the\r\nfloor was scarcely much more respectable than the company on the\r\nwalls--the fashionables, who herded together, impelled by caste, that\r\nfree-masonry of social life, enter the Beauclerk closet to look over\r\nLady Di's scenes from the 'Mysterious Mother'--the players and\r\ndramatists, finally, who crowded round Hogarth's sketch of his 'Beggars'\r\nOpera,' with portraits, and gazed on Davison's likeness of Mrs.\r\nClive:--how could poor Horace have tolerated the sound of their\r\nirreverent remarks, the dust of their shoes, the degradation of their\r\nfancying that they might doubt his spurious-looking antiquities, or\r\ncondemn his improper-looking ladies on their canvas? How, indeed, could\r\nhe? For those parlours, that library, were peopled in his days with all\r\nthose who could enhance his pleasures, or add to their own, by their\r\npresence. When Poverty stole in there, it was irradiated by Genius. When\r\npainters hovered beneath the fretted ceiling of that library, it was to\r\nthank the oracle of the day, not always for large orders, but for\r\npowerful recommendations. When actresses trod the Star Chamber, it was\r\nas modest friends, not as audacious critics on Horace, his house, and\r\nhis pictures.\r\n\r\nBefore we call up the spirits that were familiar at Strawberry--ere we\r\npass through the garden-gate, the piers of which were copied from the\r\ntomb of Bishop William de Luda, in Ely Cathedral--let us glance at the\r\nchapel, and then a word or two about Walpole's neighbours and anent\r\nTwickenham.\r\n\r\nThe front of the chapel was copied from Bishop Audley's tomb at\r\nSalisbury. Four panels of wood, taken from the Abbey of St. Edmund's\r\nBury, displayed the portraits of Cardinal Beaufort, of Humphrey Duke of\r\nGloucester, and of Archbishop Kemp. So much for the English church.\r\n\r\nNext was seen a magnificent shrine in mosaic, from the church of St.\r\nMary Maggiore, in Rome. This was the work of the noted Peter Cavalini,\r\nwho constructed the tomb of Edward the Confessor in Westminster Abbey.\r\nThe shrine had figured over the sepulchre of four martyrs, who rested\r\nbetween it in 1257: then the principal window in the chapel was brought\r\nfrom Bexhill in Sussex; and displayed portraits of Henry III. and his\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nIt was not every day that gay visitors travelled down the dusty roads\r\nfrom London to visit the recluse at Strawberry: but Horace wanted them\r\nnot, for he had neighbours. In his youth he had owned for his playfellow\r\nthe ever witty, the precocious, the all-fascinating Lady Mary Wortley\r\nMontagu. 'She was,' he wrote, 'a playfellow of mine when we were\r\nchildren. She was always a dirty little thing. This habit continued with\r\nher. When at Florence, the Grand Duke gave her apartments in his palace.\r\nOne room sufficed for everything; and when she went away, the stench was\r\nso strong that they were obliged to fumigate the chamber with vinegar\r\nfor a week.'\r\n\r\nLet not the scandal be implicitly credited. Lady Mary, dirty or clean,\r\nresided occasionally, however, at Twickenham. When the admirable Lysons\r\ncomposed his 'Environs of London,' Horace Walpole was still living--it\r\nwas in 1795--to point out to him the house in which his brilliant\r\nacquaintance lived. It was then inhabited by Dr. Morton. The profligate\r\nand clever Duke of Wharton lived also at Twickenham.\r\n\r\nMarble Hill was built by George II, for the countess of Suffolk, and\r\nHenry, Earl of Pembroke, was the architect. Of later years, the\r\nbeautiful and injured Mrs. Fitzherbert might be seen traversing the\r\ngreensward, which was laved by the then pellucid waters of the Thames.\r\nThe parish of Twickenham, in fact, was noted for the numerous characters\r\nwho have, at various times, lived in it: Robert Boyle, the great\r\nphilosopher; James Craggs, Secretary of State; Lord George Germaine;\r\nLord Bute--are strangely mixed up with the old memories which circle\r\naround Twickenham to say nothing of its being, in after years, the abode\r\nof Louis Philippe, and now, of his accomplished son.\r\n\r\nOne dark figure in the background of society haunts us also: Lady\r\nMacclesfield, the cruel mother of Savage, polluted Twickenham by her\r\nevil presence.\r\n\r\nLet us not dwell on her name, but recall, with somewhat of pride, that\r\nthe names of that knot of accomplished, intellectual women, who composed\r\nthe neighbourhood of Strawberry, were all English; those who loved to\r\nrevel in all its charms of society and intellect were our justly-prized\r\ncountrywomen.\r\n\r\nForemost in the bright constellation was Anne Seymour Conway, too soon\r\nmarried to the Hon. John Darner. She was one of the loveliest, the most\r\nenterprizing, and the most gifted women of her time--thirty-one years\r\nyounger than Horace, having been born in 1748. He doubtless liked her\r\nthe more that no ridicule could attach to his partiality, which was that\r\nof a father to a daughter, insofar as regarded his young cousin. She\r\nbelonged to a family dear to him, being the daughter of Field Marshal\r\nHenry Seymour Conway: then she was beautiful, witty, a courageous\r\npolitician, a heroine, fearless of losing caste, by aspiring to be an\r\nartist. She was, in truth, of our own time rather than of that. The\r\nworks which she left at Strawberry are scattered; and if still\r\ntraceable, are probably in many instances scarcely valued. But in that\r\nlovely spot, hallowed by the remembrance of Mrs. Siddons, who lived\r\nthere in some humble capacity--say maid, say companion--in Guy's Cliff\r\nHouse, near Warwick--noble traces of Anne Damer's genius are extant:\r\nbusts of the majestic Sally Siddons; of Nature's aristocrat, John\r\nKemble; of his brother Charles--arrest many a look, call up many a\r\nthought of Anne Damer and her gifts: her intelligence, her warmth of\r\nheart, her beauty, her associates. Of her powers Horace Walpole had the\r\nhighest opinion. 'If they come to Florence,' he wrote, speaking of Mrs.\r\nDamer's going to Italy for the winter, 'the great duke should beg Mrs.\r\nDamer to give him something of her statuary; and it would be a greater\r\ncuriosity than anything in his Chamber of Painters. She has executed\r\nseveral marvels since you saw her; and has lately carved two colossal\r\nheads for the bridge at Henley, which is the most beautiful in the\r\nworld, next to the Ponte di Trinità and was principally designed by her\r\nfather, General Conway.'\r\n\r\nNo wonder that he left to this accomplished relative the privilege of\r\nliving, after his death, at Strawberry Hill, of which she took\r\npossession in 1797, and where she remained twenty years; giving it up,\r\nin 1828, to Lord Waldegrave.\r\n\r\nShe was, as we have said, before her time in her appreciation of what\r\nwas noble and superior, in preference to that which gives to caste\r\nalone, its supremacy. During her last years she bravely espoused an\r\nunfashionable cause; and disregarding the contempt of the lofty, became\r\nthe champion of the injured and unhappy Caroline of Brunswick.\r\n\r\nFrom his retreat at Strawberry, Horace Walpole heard all that befel the\r\nobject of his flame, Lady Sophia Fermor. His letters present from time\r\nto time such passages as these; Lady Pomfret, whom he detested, being\r\nalways the object of his satire:--\r\n\r\n'There is not the least news; but that my Lord Carteret's wedding has\r\nbeen deferred on Lady Sophia's (Fermor's) falling dangerously ill of a\r\nscarlet fever; but they say it is to be next Saturday. She is to have\r\n£1,600 a year jointure, £400 pin-money, and £2,000 of jewels. Carteret\r\nsays he does not intend to marry the mother (Lady Pomfret) and the whole\r\nfamily. What do you think my Lady intends?'\r\n\r\nLord Carteret, who was the object of Lady Pomfret's successful\r\ngeneralship, was at this period, 1744, fifty-four years of age, having\r\nbeen born in 1690. He was the son of George, Lord Carteret, by Grace,\r\ndaughter of the first Earl of Bath, of the line of Granville--a title\r\nwhich became eventually his. The fair Sophia, in marrying him, espoused\r\na man of no ordinary attributes. In person, Horace Walpole, after the\r\ngrave had closed over one whom he probably envied, thus describes him:--\r\n\r\n  'Commanding beauty, smoothed by cheerful grace,\r\n  Sat on each open feature of his face.\r\n  Bold was his language, rapid, glowing, strong,\r\n  And science flowed spontaneous from his tongue:\r\n  A genius seizing systems, slighting rules,\r\n  And void of gall, with boundless scorn of fools.'\r\n\r\nAfter having been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Carteret attended his\r\nroyal master in the campaign, during which the Battle of Dettingen was\r\nfought. He now held the reins of government in his own hands as premier.\r\nLord Chesterfield has described him as possessing quick precision, nice\r\ndecision, and unbounded presumption. The Duke of Newcastle used to say\r\nof him that he was a 'man who never doubted.'\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent letter we find the sacrifice of the young and lovely\r\nSophia completed. Ambition was the characteristic of her family: and she\r\nwent, not unwillingly, to the altar. The whole affair is too amusingly\r\ntold to be given in other language than that of Horace:--\r\n\r\n'I could tell you a great deal of news,' he writes to Horace Mann, 'but\r\nit would not be what you would expect. It is not of battles, sieges, and\r\ndeclarations of war; nor of invasions, insurrections and addresses: it\r\nis the god of love, not he of war, who reigns in the newspapers. The\r\ntown has made up a list of six-and-thirty weddings, which I shall not\r\ncatalogue to you. But the chief entertainment has been the nuptials of\r\nour great Quixote (Carteret) and the fair Sophia. On the point of\r\nmatrimony, she fell ill of a scarlet fever, and was given over, while he\r\nhad the gout, but heroically sent her word, that if she was well, he\r\n_would_ be well. They corresponded every day, and he used to plague the\r\ncabinet council with reading her letters to them. Last night they were\r\nmarried; and as all he does must have a particular air in it, they\r\nsupped at Lord Pomfret's. At twelve, Lady Granville (his mother) and all\r\nhis family went to bed, but the porter: then my lord went home, and\r\nwaited for her in the lodge. She came alone, in a hackney chair, met him\r\nin the hall, and was led up the back stairs to bed. What is ridiculously\r\nlucky is, that Lord Lincoln goes into waiting to-day, and will be to\r\npresent her!'\r\n\r\nThe event was succeeded by a great ball at the Duchess of Richmond's, in\r\nhonour of the bride, Lady Carteret paying her ladyship the 'highest\r\nhonours,' which she received in the 'highest state.' 'I have seen her,'\r\nadds Horace, 'but once, and found her just what I expected, _très grande\r\ndame_, full of herself, and yet not with an air of happiness. She looks\r\nill, and is grown lean, but is still the finest figure in the world. The\r\nmother (Lady Pomfret) is not so exalted as I expected; I fancy Carteret\r\nhas kept his resolution, and does not marry her too.'\r\n\r\nWhilst this game was being played out, one of Walpole's most valued\r\nneighbours, Pope, was dying of dropsy, and every evening a gentle\r\ndelirium possessed him. Again does Horace return to the theme, ever in\r\nhis thoughts--the Carterets: again does he recount their triumphs and\r\ntheir follies.\r\n\r\n'I will not fail'--still to Horace Mann--'to make your compliments to\r\nthe Pomfrets and Carterets. I see them seldom but I am in favour; so I\r\nconclude, for my Lady Pomfret told me the other night that I said better\r\nthings than anybody. I was with them all at a subscription ball at\r\nRanelagh last week, which my Lady Carteret thought proper to look upon\r\nas given to her, and thanked the gentlemen, who were not quite so well\r\npleased at her condescending to take it to herself. I did the honours of\r\nall her dress. \"How charming your ladyship's cross is! I am sure the\r\ndesign was your own!\"--\"No, indeed; my lord sent it me just as it is.\"\r\nThen as much to the mother. Do you wonder I say better things than\r\nanybody?'\r\n\r\nBut these brilliant scenes were soon mournfully ended. Lady Sophia, the\r\nhaughty, the idolized, the Juno of that gay circle, was suddenly carried\r\noff by a fever. With real feeling Horace thus tells the tale:--\r\n\r\n'Before I talk of any public news, I must tell you what you will be very\r\nsorry for. Lady Granville (Lady Sophia Fermor) is dead. She had a fever\r\nfor six weeks before her lying-in, and could never get it off. Last\r\nSaturday they called in another physician, Dr. Oliver. On Monday he\r\npronounced her out of danger; about seven in the evening, as Lady\r\nPomfret and Lady Charlotte (Fermor) were sitting by her, the first\r\nnotice they had of her immediate danger was her sighing and saying, \"I\r\nfeel death come very fast upon me!\" She repeated the same words\r\nfrequently, remained perfectly in her senses and calm, and died about\r\neleven at night. It is very shocking for anybody so young, so handsome,\r\nso arrived at the height of happiness, to be so quickly snatched away.'\r\n\r\nSo vanished one of the brightest stars of the court. The same autumn\r\n(1745) was the epoch of a great event; the marching of Charles Edward\r\ninto England. Whilst the Duke of Cumberland was preparing to head the\r\ntroops to oppose him, the Prince of Wales was inviting a party to\r\nsupper, the main feature of which was the citadel of Carlisle in sugar,\r\nthe company all besieging it with sugar-plums. It would, indeed, as\r\nWalpole declared, be impossible to relate all the _Caligulisms_ of this\r\neffeminate, absurd prince. But buffoonery and eccentricity were the\r\norder of the day. 'A ridiculous thing happened,' Horace writes, 'when\r\nthe princess saw company after her confinement. The new-born babe was\r\nshown in a mighty pretty cradle, designed by Kent, under a canopy in the\r\ngreat drawing-room. Sir William Stanhope went to look at it. Mrs,\r\nHerbert, the governess, advanced to unmantle it. He said, \"In wax, I\r\nsuppose?\" \"Sir?\" \"In wax, madam?\" \"The young prince, sir?\" \"Yes, in wax,\r\nI suppose?\" This is his odd humour. When he went to see the duke at his\r\nbirth, he said, \"Lord, it sees!\"'\r\n\r\nThe recluse of Strawberry was soon consoled by hearing that the rebels\r\nwere driven back from Derby, where they had penetrated, and where the\r\nremembrance of the then gay, sanguine, brave young Chevalier long\r\nlingered among the old inhabitants. One of the last traces of his\r\nshort-lived possession of the town is gone: very recently, Exeter House,\r\nwhere he lodged and where he received his adherents, has been pulled\r\ndown; the ground on which it stood, with its court and garden--somewhat\r\nin appearace like an old French hotel--being too valuable for the relic\r\nof bygone times to be spared. The panelled chambers, the fine staircase,\r\ncertain pictures--one by Wright of Derby, of him--one of Miss\r\nWalkinshaw--have all disappeared.\r\n\r\nOf the capture, the trial, the death of his adherents, Horace Walpole\r\nhas left the most graphic and therefore touching account that has been\r\ngiven; whilst he calls a 'rebellion on the defensive' a 'despicable\r\naffair.' Humane, he reverted with horror to the atrocities of General\r\nHawley, 'the Chief Justice,' as he was designated, who had a 'passion\r\nfor frequent and sudden executions.' When this savage commander gained\r\nintelligence of a French spy coming over, he displayed him at once\r\nbefore the army on a gallows, dangling in his muff and boots. When one\r\nof the surgeons begged for the body of a deserter to dissect, 'Well,'\r\nsaid the wretch, 'but you must let me have the skeleton to hang up in\r\nthe guard-room,' Such was the temper of the times; vice, childishness,\r\nlevity at court, brutality in the camp, were the order of the day.\r\nHorace, even Horace, worldly in all, indifferent as to good and bad,\r\nseems to have been heart sick. His brother's matrimonial infidelity\r\nvexed him also sorely. Lady Orford, 'tired,' as he expresses it, of\r\n'sublunary affairs,' was trying to come to an arrangement with her\r\nhusband, from whom she had been long separated; the price was to be, he\r\nfancied, £2,000 a year. Meantime, during the convulsive state of\r\npolitical affairs, he interested himself continually in the improvement\r\nof Strawberry Hill. There was a rival building, Mr. Bateman's Monastery,\r\nat Old Windsor, which is said to have had more uniformity of design than\r\nStrawberry Hill. Horace used indeed to call the house of which he became\r\nso proud a paper house; the walls were at first so slight, and the roof\r\nso insecure in heavy rains. Nevertheless, his days were passed as\r\npeacefully there as the premature infirmities which came upon him would\r\npermit.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of twenty-five his fingers were enlarged and deformed by\r\nchalk-stones, which were discharged twice a year. 'I can chalk up a\r\nscore with more rapidity than any man in England,' was his melancholy\r\njest. He had now adopted as a necessity a strict temperance: he sat up\r\nvery late, either writing or conversing, yet always breakfasted at nine\r\no'clock. After the death of Madame du Deffand, a little fat dog,\r\nscarcely able to move for age and size--her legacy--used to proclaim his\r\napproach by barking. The little favourite was placed beside him on a\r\nsofa; a tea-kettle, stand, and heater were brought in, and he drank two\r\nor three cups of tea out of the finest and most precious china of\r\nJapan--that of a pure white. He breakfasted with an appetite, feeding\r\nfrom his table the little dog and his pet squirrels.\r\n\r\nDinner at Strawberry Hill was usually served up in the small parlour in\r\nwinter, the large dining-room being reserved for large parties. As age\r\ndrew on, he was supported down stairs by his valet; and then, says the\r\ncompiler of Walpoliana, 'he ate most moderately of chicken, pheasant, or\r\nany light food. Pastry he disliked, as difficult of digestion, though he\r\nwould taste a morsel of venison-pie. Never but once, that he drank two\r\nglasses of white wine, did the editor see him taste any liquor, except\r\nice-water. A pail of ice was placed under the table, in which stood a\r\ndecanter of water, from which he supplied himself with his favourite\r\nbeverage.'\r\n\r\nNo wine was drunk after dinner, when the host of Strawberry Hill called\r\ninstantly to some one to ring the bell for coffee. It was served\r\nupstairs, and there, adds the same writer, 'he would pass about five\r\no'clock, and generally resuming his place on the sofa, would sit till\r\ntwo in the morning, in miscellaneous chit-chat, full of singular\r\nanecdotes, strokes of wit, and acute observations, occasionally sending\r\nfor books, or curiosities, or passing to the library, as any reference\r\nhappened to arise in conversation. After his coffee, he tasted nothing;\r\nbut the snuff-box of _tabac d'etrennes_, from Fribourg's, was not\r\nforgotten, and was replenished from a canister lodged in an ancient\r\nmarble urn of great thickness, which stood in the window seat, and\r\nserved to secure its moisture and rich flavour.'\r\n\r\nIn spite of all his infirmities, Horace Walpole took no care of his\r\nhealth, as far as out-door exercise was concerned. His friends beheld\r\nhim with horror go out on a dewy day: he would even step out in his\r\nslippers. In his own grounds he never wore a hat: he used to say, that\r\non his first visit to Paris he was ashamed of his effeminacy, when he\r\nsaw every meagre little Frenchman whom he could have knocked down in a\r\nbreath walking without a hat, which he could not do without a certainty\r\nof taking the disease which the Germans say is endemical in England, and\r\nwhich they call _to catch cold_. The first trial, he used to tell his\r\nfriends, cost him a fever, but he got over it. Draughts of air, damp\r\nrooms, windows open at his back, became matters of indifference to him\r\nafter once getting through the hardening process. He used even to be\r\nvexed at the officious solicitude of friends on this point, and with\r\nhalf a smile would say, 'My back is the same as my face, and my neck is\r\nlike my nose.' He regarded his favourite iced-water as a preservative to\r\nhis stomach, which, he said, would last longer than his bones. He did\r\nnot take into account that the stomach is usually the seat of disease.\r\n\r\nOne naturally inquires why the amiable recluse never, in his best days,\r\nthought of marriage: a difficult question to be answered. In men of that\r\nperiod, a dissolute life, an unhappy connection, too frequently\r\nexplained the problem. In the case before us no such explanation can be\r\noffered. Horace Walpole had many votaries, many friends, several\r\nfavourites, but no known mistress. The marks of the old bachelor\r\nfastened early on him, more especially after he began to be governed by\r\nhis _valet de chambre_. The notable personage who ruled over the pliant\r\nHorace was a Swiss, named Colomb. This domestic tyrant was despotic; if\r\nHorace wanted a tree to be felled, Colomb opposed it, and the master\r\nyielded. Servants, in those days, were intrinsically the same as in\r\nours, but they differed in manner. The old familiarity had not gone out,\r\nbut existed as it still does among the French. Those who recollect Dr.\r\nParr will remember how stern a rule his factotum Sam exercised over him.\r\nSam put down what wine he chose, nay, almost invited the guests; at all\r\nevents, he had his favourites among them. And in the same way as Sam\r\nruled at Hatton, Colomb was, _de facto,_ the master of Strawberry Hill.\r\n\r\nWith all its defects, the little 'plaything house' as Horace Walpole\r\ncalled it, must have been a charming house to visit in. First, there was\r\nthe host. 'His engaging manners,' writes the editor of Walpoliana, 'and\r\ngentle, endearing affability to his friends, exceed all praise. Not the\r\nsmallest hauteur, or consciousness of rank or talent, appeared in his\r\nfamiliar conferences; and he was ever eager to dissipate any constraint\r\nthat might occur, as imposing a constraint upon himself, and knowing\r\nthat any such chain enfeebles and almost annihilates the mental powers.\r\nEndued with exquisite sensibility, his wit never gave the smallest\r\nwound, even to the grossest ignorance of the world, or the most morbid\r\nhypochondriac bashfulness.'\r\n\r\nHe had, in fact, no excuse for being doleful or morbid. How many\r\nresources were his! what an even destiny! what prosperous fortunes! What\r\nlearned luxury he revelled in! he was enabled to 'pick up all the roses\r\nof science, and to leave the thorns behind.' To how few of the gifted\r\nhave the means of gratification been permitted! to how many has hard\r\nwork been allotted! Then, when genius has been endowed with rank, with\r\nwealth, how often it has been degraded by excess! Rochester's passions\r\nran riot in one century: Beckford's gifts were polluted by his vices in\r\nanother--signal landmarks of each age. But Horace Walpole was prudent,\r\ndecorous, even respectable: no elevated aspirations, no benevolent views\r\nennobled under the _petitesse_ of his nature. He had neither genius nor\r\nromance: he was even devoid of sentiment; but he was social to all,\r\nneighbourly to many, and attached to some of his fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nThe 'prettiest bauble' possible, as he called Strawberry Hill, 'set in\r\nenamelled meadows in filigree hedges,' was surrounded by 'dowagers as\r\nplenty as flounders;' such was Walpole's assertion. As he sat in his\r\nlibrary, scented by caraway, heliotropes, or pots of tuberose, or\r\norange-trees in flower, certain dames would look in upon him, sometimes\r\n_malgrê lui_, sometimes to his bachelor heart's content.\r\n\r\n'Thank God!' he wrote to his cousin Conway, 'the Thames is between me\r\nand the Duchess of Queensberry!' Walpole's dislike to his fair neighbour\r\nmay partly have originated in the circumstance of her birth, and her\r\ngrace's presuming to plume herself on what he deemed an unimportant\r\ndistinction. Catherine Hyde, Duchess of Queensberry, was the\r\ngreat-granddaughter of the famous Lord Clarendon, and the great-niece of\r\nAnne, Duchess of York. Prior had in her youth celebrated her in the\r\n'Female Phaëton,' as 'Kitty:' in his verse he begs Phaëton to give Kitty\r\nthe chariot, if but for a day.\r\n\r\nIn reference to this, Horace Walpole, in the days of his admiration of\r\nher grace, had made the following impromptu:--\r\n\r\n'On seeing the Duchess of Queensberry walk at the funeral of the\r\nPrincess Dowager of Wales,--\r\n\r\n  'To many a Kitty, Love his car\r\n  Would for a day engage;\r\n  But Prior's Kitty, ever fair,\r\n  Obtained it for an age.'\r\n\r\nIt was Kitty who took Gay under her patronage, who resented the\r\nprohibition of the 'Beggar's Opera,' remonstrated with the king and\r\nqueen, and was thereupon forbidden the court. She carried the poet to\r\nher house. She may have been ridiculous, but she had a warm, generous\r\nheart. 'I am now,' Gay wrote to Swift in 1729, 'in the Duke of\r\nQueensberry's house, and have been so ever since I left Hampstead; where\r\nI was carried at a time that it was thought I could not live a day. I\r\nmust acquaint you (because I know it will please you) that during my\r\nsickness I had many of the kindest proofs of friendship, particularly\r\nfrom the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry; who, if I had been their\r\nnearest relation and dearest friend, could not have treated me with more\r\nconstant attendance then, and they continue the same to me now.'\r\n\r\nThe duchess appears to have been one of those wilful, eccentric, spoiled\r\nchildren, whom the world at once worships and ridicules: next to the\r\nCountess of Pomfret, she was Horace Walpole's pet aversion. She was well\r\ndescribed as being 'very clever, very whimsical, and just not mad.' Some\r\nof Walpole's touches are strongly confirmatory of this description. For\r\ninstance, her grace gives a ball, orders every one to come at six, to\r\nsup at twelve, and go away directly after: opens the ball herself with a\r\nminuet. To this ball she sends strange invitations; 'yet,' says Horace,\r\n'except these flights, the only extraordinary thing the duchess did was\r\nto do nothing extraordinary, for I do not call it very mad that some\r\npique happening between her and the Duchess of Bedford, the latter had\r\nthis distich sent to her;--\r\n\r\n  'Come with a whistle--come with a call:\r\n  Come with good-will, or come not at all.'\r\n\r\n'I do not know whether what I am going to tell you did not border a\r\nlittle upon Moorfields. The gallery where they danced was very cold.\r\nLord Lorn, George Selwyn, and I retired into a little room, and sat\r\ncomfortably by the fire. The duchess looked in, said nothing, and sent a\r\nsmith to take the hinges of the door oft. We understood the hint--left\r\nthe room--and so did the smith the door.'\r\n\r\n'I must tell you,' he adds in another letter, 'of an admirable reply of\r\nyour acquaintance, the Duchess of Queensberry: old Lady Granville, Lord\r\nCarteret's mother, whom they call _the queen-mother_, from taking upon\r\nher to do the honours of her son's power, was pressing the duchess to\r\nask her for some place for herself or friends, and assured her that she\r\nwould procure it, be it what it would. Could she have picked out a\r\nfitter person to be gracious to? The duchess made her a most grave\r\ncurtsey, and said, \"Indeed, there was one thing she had set her heart\r\non.\"--\"Dear child, how you oblige me by asking anything! What is it?\r\nTell me.\"--\"Only that you would speak to my Lord Carteret to get me made\r\nlady of the bedchamber to the Queen of Hungary.\"'\r\n\r\nThe duchess was, therefore, one of the dowagers, 'thick as flounders,'\r\nwhose proximity was irritating to the fastidious bachelor. There was,\r\nhowever, another Kitty between whom and Horace a tender friendship\r\nsubsisted: this was Kitty Clive, the famous actress; formerly Kitty\r\nRuftar. Horace had given her a house on his estate, which he called\r\nsometimes 'Little Strawberry Hill,' and sometimes 'Cliveden;' and here\r\nMrs. Clive lived with her brother, Mr. Ruftar, until 1785. She formed,\r\nfor her friend, a sort of outer-home, in which he passed his evenings.\r\nLong had he admired her talents. Those were the days of the drama in all\r\nits glory: the opera was unfashionable. There were, Horace writes in\r\n1742, on the 26th of May, only two-and-forty people in the Opera House,\r\nin the pit and boxes: people were running to see 'Miss Lucy in Town,' at\r\nDrury Lane, and to admire Mrs. Clive, in her imitation of the\r\nMuscovites; but the greatest crowds assembled to wonder at Garrick, in\r\n'Wine Merchant turned Player;' and great and small alike rushed to\r\nGoodman's Fields to see him act all parts, and to laugh at his admirable\r\nmimicry. It was perhaps, somewhat in jealousy of the counter attraction,\r\nthat Horace declared he saw nothing wonderful in the acting of Garrick,\r\nthough it was then heresy to say so. 'Now I talk of players,' he adds in\r\nthe same letter, 'tell Mr. Chute that his friend Bracegirdle breakfasted\r\nwith me this morning.' Horace delighted in such intimacies, and in\r\nrecalling old times.\r\n\r\nMrs. Abingdon, another charming and clever actress, was also a denizen\r\nof Twickenham, which became the most fashionable village near the\r\nmetropolis. Mrs. Pritchard, likewise, was attracted there; but the\r\nproximity of the Countess of Suffolk, who lived at Marble Hill was the\r\ndelight of a great portion of Horace Walpole's life. Her reminiscences,\r\nher anecdotes, her experience, were valuable as well as entertaining to\r\none who was for ever gathering up materials for history, or for\r\nbiography, or for letters to absent friends.\r\n\r\nIn his own family he found little to cheer him: but if he hated one or\r\ntwo more especially--and no one could hate more intensely than Horace\r\nWalpole--it was his uncle, Lord Wapole, and his cousin, that nobleman's\r\nson, whom he christened Pigwiggin; 'my monstrous uncle;' 'that old\r\nbuffoon, my uncle;' are terms which occur in his letters, and he speaks\r\nof the bloody civil wars between 'Horatio Walpole' and 'Horace Walpole.'\r\n\r\nHoratio Walpole, the brother of Sir Robert, was created in June, 1756,\r\nBaron Walpole of Wolterton, as a recompense for fifty years passed in\r\nthe public service--an honour which he only survived nine months. He\r\nexpired in February, 1757. His death removed one subject of bitter\r\ndislike from the mind of Horace; but enough remained in the family to\r\nexcite grief and resentment.\r\n\r\nTowards his own two brothers, Robert, Earl of Orford, and Edward\r\nWalpole, Horace the younger, as he was styled in contradistinction to\r\nhis uncle, bore very little affection. His feelings, however, for his\r\nnephew George, who succeeded his father as Earl of Orford in 1751, were\r\nmore creditable to his heart; yet he gives a description of this\r\nill-fated young man in his letters, which shows at once pride and\r\ndisapprobation. One lingers with regret over the character and the\r\ndestiny of this fine young nobleman, whose existence was rendered\r\nmiserable by frequent attacks, at intervals, of insanity.\r\n\r\nNever was there a handsomer, a more popular, a more engaging being than\r\nGeorge, third Earl of Orford. When he appeared at the head of the\r\nNorfolk regiment of militia, of which he was colonel, even the great\r\nLord Chatham broke out into enthusiasm:--'Nothing,' he wrote, 'could\r\nmake a better appearance than the two Norfolk battalions; Lord Orford,\r\nwith the front of Mars himself, and really the greatest figure under\r\narms I ever saw, as the theme of every tongue.' His person and air,\r\nHorace Walpole declared, had a noble wildness in them: crowds followed\r\nthe battalions when the king reviewed them in Hyde Park; and among the\r\ngay young officers in their scarlet uniforms, faced with black, in their\r\nbuff waistcoats and gold buttons, none was so conspicuous for martial\r\nbearing as Lord Onord, although classed by his uncle 'among the knights\r\nof shire who had never in their lives shot anything but woodcocks.'\r\n\r\nBut there was a peculiarity of character in the young peer which shocked\r\nHorace. 'No man,' he says in one of his letters, 'ever felt such a\r\ndisposition to love another as I did to love him. I flattered myself\r\nthat he would restore some lustre to our house--at least not let it\r\ntotally sink; but I am forced to give him up, and all my Walpole\r\nviews.... He has a good breeding, and attention when he is with you that\r\nis even flattering;... he promises, offers everything one can wish; but\r\nthis is all: the instant he leaves you, all the world are nothing to\r\nhim; he would not give himself the least trouble in the world to give\r\nany one satisfaction; yet this is mere indolence of mind, not of body:\r\nhis whole pleasure is outrageous exercise.'\r\n\r\n'He is,' in another place Horace adds, 'the most selfish man in the\r\nworld: without being in the least interested, he loves nobody but\r\nhimself, yet neglects every view of fortune and ambition. Yet,' he\r\nconcludes, 'it is impossible not to love him when one sees him:\r\nimpossible to esteem him when one thinks on him.'\r\n\r\nThe young lord, succeeding to an estate deeply encumbered, both by his\r\nfather and grandfather, rushed on the turf, and involved himself still\r\nmore. In vain did Horace the younger endeavour to secure for him the\r\nhand of Miss Nicholls, an heiress with £50,000, and, to that end, placed\r\nthe young lady with Horace the elder (Lord Walpole), at Wolterton. The\r\nscheme failed: the crafty old politician thought he might as well\r\nbenefit his own sons as his nephew, for he had himself claims on the\r\nHoughton estate which he expected Miss Nicholl's fortune might help to\r\nliquidate.\r\n\r\nAt length the insanity and recklessness displayed by his nephew--the\r\nhandsome martial George--induced poor Horace to take affairs in his own\r\nhands. His reflections, on his paying a visit to Houghton to look after\r\nthe property there, are pathetically expressed:--\r\n\r\n'Here I am again at Houghton,' he writes in March, 1761, 'and alone; in\r\nthis spot where (except two hours last month) I have not been in sixteen\r\nyears. Think what a crowd of reflections!... Here I am probably for the\r\nlast time of my life: every clock that strikes, tells me I am an hour\r\nnearer to yonder church--that church into which I have not yet had\r\ncourage to enter; where lies that mother on whom I doated, and who\r\ndoated on me! There are the two rival mistresses of Houghton, neither of\r\nwhom ever wished to enjoy it. There, too, is he who founded its\r\ngreatness--to contribute to whose fall Europe was embroiled; there he\r\nsleeps in quiet and dignity, while his friend and his foe--rather his\r\nfalse ally and real enemy--Newcastle and Bath, are exhausting the dregs\r\nof their pitiful lives in squabbles and pamphlets.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked at the pictures--that famous Houghton collection--the\r\nsurprise of Horace was excessive. Accustomed to see nothing elsewhere\r\nbut daubs, he gazed with ecstasy on them. 'The majesty of Italian\r\nideas,' he says, 'almost sinks before the warm nature of Italian\r\ncolouring! Alas! don't I grow old?'\r\n\r\nAs he lingered in the gallery, with mingled pride and sadness, a party\r\narrived to see the house--a man and three women in riding-dresses--who\r\n'rode post' through the apartments. 'I could not,' he adds, 'hurry\r\nbefore them fast enough; they were not so long in seeing the whole\r\ngallery as I could have been in one room, to examine what I knew by\r\nheart. I remember formerly being often diverted with this kind of\r\n_seers_; they come, ask what such a room is called in which Sir Robert\r\nlay, write it down, admire a lobster or a cabbage in a Market Piece,\r\ndispute whether the last room was green or purple, and then hurry to the\r\ninn, for fear the fish should be over-dressed. How different my\r\nsensations! not a picture here but recalls a history; not one but I\r\nremembered in Downing Street, or Chelsea, where queens and crowds\r\nadmired them, though seeing them as little as these travellers![5]\r\n\r\n[5: Sir Robert Walpole purchased a house and garden at Chelsea in 1722,\r\nnear the college, adjoining Gough House.--Cunningham's 'London.']\r\n\r\nAfter tea he strolled into the garden. They told him it was now called a\r\n_pleasure-ground._ To Horace it was a scene of desolation--a floral\r\nNineveh. 'What a dissonant idea of pleasure!--those groves, those\r\n_allées_, where I have passed so many charming moments, were now\r\nstripped up or overgrown--many fond paths I could not unravel, though\r\nwith an exact clue in my memory. I met two gamekeepers, and a thousand\r\nhares! In the days when all my soul was tuned to pleasure and vivacity\r\n(and you will think perhaps it is far from being out of tune yet), I\r\nhated Houghton and its solitude; yet I loved this garden, as now, with\r\nmany regrets, I love Houghton--Houghton, I know not what to call it--a\r\nmonument of grandeur or ruin!'\r\n\r\nAlthough he did not go with the expectation of finding a land flowing\r\nwith milk and honey, the sight of all this ruin long saddened his\r\nthoughts. All was confusion, disorder, debts, mortgages, sales, pillage,\r\nvillainy, waste, folly, and madness. The nettles and brambles in the\r\npark were up to his shoulders; horses had been turned into the garden,\r\nand banditti lodged in every cottage.\r\n\r\nThe perpetuity of livings that came up to the very park-palings had been\r\nsold, and the farms let at half their value. Certainly, if Houghton were\r\nbought by Sir Robert Walpole with public money, that public was now\r\navenged.\r\n\r\nThe owner of this ruined property had just stemmed the torrent; but the\r\nworst was to come. The pictures were sold, and to Russia they went.\r\n\r\nWhilst thus harassed by family misfortunes, other annoyances came. The\r\nmournful story of Chatterton's fate was painfully mixed up with the\r\ntenour of Horace Walpole's life.\r\n\r\nThe gifted and unfortunate Thomas Chatterton was born at Bristol in\r\n1752. Even from his birth fate seemed to pursue him, for he was a\r\nposthumous son: and if the loss of a father in the highest ranks of life\r\nbe severely felt, how much more so is it to be deplored in those which\r\nare termed the working classes!\r\n\r\nThe friendless enthusiast was slow in learning to read; but when the\r\nilluminated capitals of an old book were presented to him, he quickly\r\nlearned his letters. This fact, and his being taught to read out of a\r\nblack-letter Bible, are said to have accounted for his facility in the\r\nimitation of antiquities. Pensive and taciturn, he picked up education\r\nat a charity-school, until apprenticed to a scrivener, when he began\r\nthat battle of life which ended to him so fatally.\r\n\r\nUpon very slight accidents did his destiny hinge. In those days women\r\nworked with thread, and used thread-papers. Now paper was, at that time,\r\ndear: dainty matrons liked tasty thread-papers. A pretty set of\r\nthread-papers, with birds or flowers painted on each, was no mean\r\npresent for a friend. Chatterton, a quiet child, one day noticed that\r\nhis mother's thread-papers were of no ordinary materials. They were made\r\nof parchment, and on this parchment was some of the black-letter\r\ncharacters by which his childish attention had been fixed to his book.\r\nThe fact was, that his uncle was sexton to the ancient church of St.\r\nMary Redcliffe, at Bristol; and the parchment was the fruit of theft.\r\nChatterton's father had carried off, from a room in the church, certain\r\nancient manuscripts, which had been left about; being originally\r\nabstracted from what was called Mr. Canynge's coffin. Mr. Canynge, an\r\neminent merchant, had rebuilt St. Mary Redcliffe in the reign of Edward\r\nIV.: and the parchments, therefore, were of some antiquity. The\r\nantiquary groans over their loss in vain: Chatterton's father had\r\ncovered his books with them; his mother had used up the strips for\r\nthread-papers; and Thomas Chatterton himself contrived to abstract a\r\nconsiderable portion also, for his own purposes.\r\n\r\nHe was ingenious, industrious, a poet by nature, and, wonderful to say,\r\nwithal a herald by taste. Upon his nefarious possessions, he founded a\r\nscheme of literary forgeries; purporting to be ancient pieces of poetry\r\nfound in Canynge's chest; and described as being the production of\r\nThomas Canynge and of his friend, one Thomas Rowley, a priest. Money and\r\nbooks were sent to Chatterton in return for little strips of vellum,\r\nwhich he passed off as the original itself; and the successful forger\r\nmight now be seen in deep thought, walking in the meadows near\r\nRedcliffe; a marked, admired, poetic youth.\r\n\r\nIn 1769, Chatterton wrote to Horace Walpole, offering to send him some\r\naccounts of eminent painters who had flourished at Bristol, and at the\r\nsame time mentioning the discovery of the poems, and enclosing some\r\nspecimens. In a subsequent letter he begged Walpole to aid him in his\r\nwish to be freed from his then servile condition, and to be placed in\r\none more congenial to his pursuits.\r\n\r\nIn his choice of a patron poor Chatterton made a fatal mistake. The\r\nbenevolence of Horace was of a general kind, and never descended to\r\nanything obscure or unappreciated. There was a certain hardness in that\r\nnature of his which had so pleasant an aspect. 'An artist,' he once\r\nsaid, 'has his pencils--an author his pens--and the public must reward\r\nthem as it pleases.' Alas! he forgot how long it is before penury, even\r\nennobled by genius, can make itself seen, heard, approved, repaid: how\r\nvast is the influence of _prestige!_ how generous the hand which is\r\nextended to those in want, even if in error! All that Horace did,\r\nhowever, was strictly correct: he showed the poems to Gray and Mason,\r\nwho pronounced them forgeries; and he wrote a cold and reproving letter\r\nto the starving author: and no one could blame him: Chatterton demanded\r\nback his poems; Walpole was going to Paris, and forgot to return them.\r\nAnother letter came: the wounded poet again demanded them, adding that\r\nWalpole would not have dared to use him so had he not been poor. The\r\npoems were returned in a blank cover: and here all Walpole's concern\r\nwith Thomas Chatterton ends. All this happened in 1769. In August, 1770,\r\nthe remains of the unhappy youth were carried to the burial-ground of\r\nShoe Lane workhouse, near Holborn. He had swallowed arsenic; had\r\nlingered a day in agonies; and then, at the age of eighteen expired.\r\nStarvation had prompted the act: yet on the day before he had committed\r\nit, he had refused a dinner, of which he was invited by his hostess to\r\npartake, assuring her that he was not hungry. Just or unjust, the world\r\nhas never forgiven Horace Walpole for Chatterton's misery. His\r\nindifference has been contrasted with the generosity of Edmund Burke to\r\nCrabbe: a generosity to which we owe 'The Village,' 'The Borough,' and\r\nto which Crabbe owed his peaceful old age, and almost his existence. The\r\ncases were different; but Crabbe had his faults--and Chatterton was\r\nworth saving. It is well for genius that there are souls in the world\r\nmore sympathizing, less worldly, and more indulgent, than those of such\r\nmen as Horace Walpole. Even the editor of 'Walpoliana' lets judgment go\r\nby default. 'As to artists,' he says, 'he paid them what they earned,\r\nand he commonly employed mean ones, that the reward might be smaller.'\r\n\r\nLet us change the strain: stilled be the mournful note on which we have\r\nrested too long. What have wits and beaux and men of society to do with\r\npoets and beggars? Behold, Horace, when he has written his monitory\r\nletter, packs up for Paris. Let us follow him there, and see him in the\r\nvery centre of his pleasures--in the _salon_ of La Marquise du Deffand.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole had perfected his education, as a fine gentleman, by his\r\nintimacy with Madame Geoffrin, to whom Lady Hervey had introduced him.\r\nShe called him _le nouveau Richelieu_; and Horace was sensible of so\r\ngreat a compliment from a woman at once '_spirituelle_ and _pieuse_'--a\r\ncombination rare in France. Nevertheless, she had the national views of\r\nmatrimony. 'What have you done, Madame,' said a foreigner to her, 'with\r\nthe poor man I used to see here, who never spoke a word?'\r\n\r\n'Ah, _mon Dieu!_ was the reply, 'that was my husband: he is dead.' She\r\nspoke in the same tone as if she had been specifying the last new opera,\r\nor referring to the latest work in vogue: things just passed away.\r\n\r\nThe _Marquise du Deffaud_ was a very different personage to Madame\r\nGeoffrin, whose great enemy she was. When Horace Walpole first entered\r\ninto the society of the Marquise, she was stone blind, and old; but\r\nretained not only her wit, and her memory, but her passions. Passions,\r\nlike artificial flowers, are unbecoming to age: and those of the witty,\r\natheistical Marquise are almost revolting. Scandal still attached her\r\nname to that of Hénault, of whom Voltaire wrote the epitaph beginning\r\n\r\n  'Henault, fameus par vos soupers\r\n  Et votre \"chronologie,\"' &c.\r\n\r\nHénault was for many years deaf; and, during the whole of his life,\r\ndisagreeable. There was something farcical in the old man's receptions\r\non his death-bed; whilst, amongst the rest of the company came Madame du\r\nDeffand, a blind old woman of seventy, who, bawling in his ear, aroused\r\nthe lethargic man, by inquiring after a former rival of hers, Madame de\r\nCastelmaron--about whom he went on babbling until death stopped his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nShe was seventy years of age when Horace Walpole, at fifty, became her\r\npassion. She was poor and disreputable, and even the high position of\r\nhaving been mistress to the regent could not save her from being decried\r\nby a large portion of that society which centered round the _bel\r\nesprit_. 'She was,' observes the biographer of Horace Walpole (the\r\nlamented author of the 'Crescent and the Cross,') 'always gay, always\r\ncharming--everything but a Christian.' The loss of her eyesight did not\r\nimpair the remains of her beauty; her replies, her compliments, were\r\nbrilliant; even from one whose best organs of expression were mute.\r\n\r\nA frequent guest at her suppers, Walpole's kindness, real or pretended,\r\nsoon made inroads on a heart still susceptible. The ever-green passions\r\nof this venerable sinner threw out fresh shoots; and she became\r\nenamoured of the attentive and admired Englishman. Horace was\r\nsusceptible of ridicule: there his somewhat icy heart was easily\r\ntouched. Partly in vanity, partly in playfulness, he encouraged the\r\nsentimental-exaggeration of his correspondent; but, becoming afraid of\r\nthe world's laughter, ended by reproving her warmth, and by chilling,\r\nunder the refrigerating influence of his cautions, all the romance of\r\nthe octogenarian.\r\n\r\nIn later days, however, after his solicitude--partly soothed by the\r\nreturn of his letters to Madame du Deffand, partly by her death--had\r\ncompletely subsided, a happier friendship was permitted to solace his\r\nnow increasing infirmities, as well as to enhance his social pleasures.\r\n\r\nIt was during the year 1788, when he was living in retirement at\r\nStrawberry, that his auspicious friendship was formed. The only grain of\r\nambition he had left he declared was to believe himself forgotten; that\r\nwas 'the thread that had run through his life;' 'so true,' he adds,\r\n'except the folly of being an author, has been what I said last year to\r\nthe Prince' (afterwards George IV.), 'when he asked me \"If I was a\r\nFreemason,\" I replied, \"No sir; I never was anything.\"'\r\n\r\nLady Charleville told him that some of her friends had been to see\r\nStrawberry. 'Lord!' cried one lady, 'who is that Mr. Walpole?' 'Lord!'\r\ncried a second; 'don't you know the great epicure, Mr. Walpole?' 'Who?'\r\ncried the first,--'great epicure! you mean the antiquarian.' 'Surely,'\r\nadds Horace, 'this anecdote may take its place in the chapter of local\r\nfame.'\r\n\r\nBut he reverts to his new acquisition--the acquaintance of the Miss\r\nBerrys, who had accidentally taken a house next to his at Strawberry\r\nHill. Their story, he adds, was a curious one: their descent Scotch;\r\ntheir grandfather had an estate of £5,000 a year, but disinherited his\r\nson on account of his marrying a woman with no fortune. She died, and\r\nthe grandfather, wishing for an heir-male, pressed the widower to marry\r\nagain: he refused; and said he would devote himself to the education of\r\nhis two daughters. The second son generously gave up £8oo a year to his\r\nbrother, and the two motherless girls were taken to the Continent,\r\nwhence they returned the 'best informed and most perfect creatures that\r\nHorace Walpole ever saw at their age.'\r\n\r\nSensible, natural, frank, their conversation proved most agreeable to a\r\nman who was sated of grand society, and sick of vanity until he had\r\nindulged in vexation of spirit. He discovered by chance only--for there\r\nwas no pedantry in these truly well-educated women--that the eldest\r\nunderstood Latin, and 'was a perfect Frenchwoman in her language. Then\r\nthe youngest drew well; and copied one of Lady Di Beauclerk's pictures,\r\n'The Gipsies,' though she had never attempted colours before. Then, as\r\nto looks: Mary, the eldest, had a sweet face, the more interesting from\r\nbeing pale; with fine dark eyes that were lighted up when she spoke.\r\nAgnes, the younger, was 'hardly to be called handsome, but almost;' with\r\nan agreeable sensible countenance. It is remarkable that women thus\r\ndelineated--not beauties, yet not plain--are always the most fascinating\r\nto men. The sisters doted on each other: Mary taking the lead in\r\nsociety. 'I must even tell you,' Horace wrote to the Countess of Ossory,\r\n'that they dress within the bounds of fashion, but without the\r\nexcrescences and balconies with which modern hoydens overwhelm and\r\nbarricade their persons.' (One would almost have supposed that Horace\r\nhad lived in the days of crinoline.')\r\n\r\nThe first night that Horace met the two sisters, he refused to be\r\nintroduced to them: having heard so much of them that he concluded they\r\nwould be 'all pretension.' The second night that he met them, he sat\r\nnext Mary, and found her an 'angel both inside and out.' He did not know\r\nwhich he liked best; but Mary's face, which was formed for a sentimental\r\nnovel, or, still more, for genteel comedy, riveted him, he owned. Mr.\r\nBerry, the father, was a little 'merry man with a round face,' whom no\r\none would have suspected of sacrificing 'all for love, and the world\r\nwell lost.' This delightful family visited him every Sunday evening; the\r\nregion of wickenham being too 'proclamatory' for cards to be introduced\r\non the seventh day, conversation was tried instead; thankful, indeed,\r\nwas Horace, for the 'pearls,' as he styled them, thus thrown in his\r\npath. His two 'Strawberries,' as he christened them, were henceforth the\r\ntheme of every letter. He had set up a printing-press many years\r\npreviously at Strawberry, and on taking the young ladies to see it, he\r\nremembered the gallantry of his former days, and they found these\r\nstanzas in type:--\r\n\r\n  'To Mary's lips has ancient Rome\r\n    Her purest language taught;\r\n  And from the modern city home\r\n    Agnes its pencil brought.\r\n\r\n  'Rome's ancient Horace sweetly chants\r\n    Such maids with lyric fire;\r\n  Albion's old Horace sings nor paints,\r\n    He only can admire.\r\n\r\n  'Still would his press their fame record,\r\n    So amiable the pair is!\r\n  But, ah! how vain to think his word\r\n    Can add a straw to Berry's.'\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Mary, whom he terms the Latin nymph sent the\r\nfollowing lines:--\r\n\r\n  'Had Rome's famed Horace thus addrest\r\n    His Lydia or his Lyce,\r\n  He had ne'er so oft complained their breast\r\n    To him was cold and icy.\r\n\r\n  'But had they sought their joy to explain,\r\n    Or praise their generous bard,\r\n  Perhaps, like me, they had tried in vain,\r\n    And felt the task too hard.'\r\n\r\nThe society of this family gave Horace Walpole the truest, and perhaps\r\nthe only relish he ever had of domestic life. But his mind was harassed\r\ntowards the close of the eighteenth century, by the insanity not only of\r\nhis nephew, but by the great national calamity, that of the king. 'Every\r\n_eighty-eight_ seems,' he remarks, 'to be a favourite period with fate;'\r\nhe was 'too ancient,' he said, 'to tap what might almost be called a new\r\nreign;' of which he was not likely to see much. He never pretended to\r\npenetration, but his foresight, 'if he gave it the reign, would not\r\nprognosticate much felicity to the country from the madness of his\r\nfather, and the probable regency of the Prince of Wales. His happiest\r\nrelations were now not with politics or literature, but with Mrs. Damer\r\nand the Miss Berrys, to whom he wrote:--'I am afraid of protesting how\r\nmuch I delight in your society, lest I should seem to affect being\r\ngallant; but, if two negatives make an affirmative, why may not two\r\nridicules compose one piece of sense? and, therefore, as I am in love\r\nwith you both, I trust it is a proof of the good sense of your\r\ndevoted--H. WALPOLE,'\r\n\r\nHe was doomed, in the decline of life, to witness two great national\r\nconvulsions: of the insurrection of 1745 he wrote\r\nfeelingly--justly--almost pathetically: forty-five years later he was\r\ntired, he said, of railing against French barbarity and folly.\r\n'Legislators! a Senate! To neglect laws, in order to annihilate\r\ncoats-of-arms and liveries!' George Selwyn said, that Monsieur the\r\nking's brother was the only man of rank from whom they could not take a\r\ntitle. His alarm at the idea of his two young friends going to the\r\nContinent was excessive. The flame of revolution had burst forth at\r\nFlorence: Flanders was not a safe road; dreadful horrors had been\r\nperpetrated at Avignon. Then he relates a characteristic anecdote of\r\npoor _Marie Antoinette!_ She went with the king to see the manufacture\r\nof glass. As they passed the Halle, the _poissardes_ hurra'd them. 'Upon\r\nmy word,' said the queen, 'these folks are civiller when you visit them,\r\nthan when they visit you.'\r\n\r\nWalpole's affection for the Miss Berrys cast a glow of happiness over\r\nthe fast-ebbing years of his life, 'In happy days,' he wrote to them\r\nwhen they were abroad, 'I called you my dear wives; now I can only think\r\nof you as darling children, of whom I am bereaved.' He was proud of\r\ntheir affection; proud of their spending many hours with 'a very old\r\nman,' whilst they were the objects of general admiration. These charming\r\nwomen survived until our own time: the centre of a circle of the leading\r\ncharacters in literature, politics, art, rank, and virtue. They are\r\nremembered with true regret. The fulness of their age perfected the\r\npromise of their youth. Samuel Rogers used to say that they had lived in\r\nthe reign of Queen Anne, so far back seemed their memories which were so\r\ncoupled to the past; but the youth of their minds, their feelings, their\r\nintelligence, remained almost to the last.\r\n\r\nFor many years Horace Walpole continued, in spite of incessant attacks\r\nof the gout, to keep almost open house at Strawberry; in short, he said,\r\nhe kept an inn--the sign, the Gothic Castle! 'Take my advice,' he wrote\r\nto a friend, 'never build a charming house for yourself between London\r\nand Hampton Court; everybody will live in it but you.'\r\n\r\nThe death of Lady Suffolk, in 1767, had been an essential loss to her\r\npartial, and not too rigid neighbours. Two days before the death of\r\nGeorge II. she had gone to Kensington not knowing that there was a\r\nreview there. Hemmed in by coaches, she found herself close to George\r\nII. and to Lady Yarmouth. Neither of them knew her--a circumstance which\r\ngreatly affected the countess.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole was now desirous of growing old with dignity. He had no\r\nwish 'to dress up a withered person, nor to drag it about to public\r\nplaces;' but he was equally averse from 'sitting at home, wrapped up in\r\nflannels,' to receive condolences from people he did not care for--and\r\nattentions from relations who were impatient for his death. Well might a\r\nwriter in the 'Quarterly Review' remark that our most useful lessons in\r\nreading Walpole's Letters are not only derived from his sound sense, but\r\nfrom 'considering this man of the world, full of information and\r\nsparkling with vivacity, stretched on a sick bed, and apprehending all\r\nthe tedious languor of helpless decrepitude and deserted solitude.' His\r\nlater years had been diversified by correspondence with Hannah More, who\r\nsent him her poem of the _Bas Bleu_, into which she had introduced his\r\nname. In 1786 she visited him at Strawberry Hill. He was then a martyr\r\nto the gout, but with spirits gay as ever: 'I never knew a man suffer\r\npain with such entire patience,' was Hannah More's remark. His\r\ncorrespondence with her continued regularly; but that with the charming\r\nsisters was delightfully interrupted by their residence at little\r\nStrawberry Hill--_Cliveden_, as it was also called, where day after day,\r\nnight after night, they gleaned stores from that rich fund of anecdote\r\nwhich went back to the days of George I., touched even on the anterior\r\nepoch of Anne, and came in volumes of amusement down to the very era\r\nwhen the old man was sitting by his parlour fire, happy with his _wives_\r\nnear him, resigned and cheerful. For his young friends he composed his\r\n'Reminiscences of the Court of England.'\r\n\r\nHe still wrote cheerfully of his physical state, in which eyesight was\r\nperfect; hearing little impaired; and though his hands and feet were\r\ncrippled, he could use them; and since he neither 'wished to box, to\r\nwrestle, nor to dance a hornpipe,' he was contented.\r\n\r\nHis character became softer, his wit less caustic, his heart more\r\ntender, his talk more reverent, as he approached the term of a long,\r\nprosperous life--and knew, practically, the small value of all that he\r\nhad once too fondly prized.\r\n\r\nHis later years were disturbed by the marriage of his niece Maria\r\nWaldegrave to the Duke of Gloucester: but the severest interruption to\r\nhis peace was his own succession to an Earldom.\r\n\r\nIn 1791, George, Earl of Orford, expired; leaving an estate encumbered\r\nwith debt, and, added to the bequest, a series of lawsuits threatened to\r\nbreak down all remaining comfort in the mind of the uncle, who had\r\nalready suffered so much on the young man's account.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole disdained the honours which brought him such solid\r\ntrouble, with such empty titles, and for some time refused to sign\r\nhimself otherwise but 'Uncle to the late Earl of Orford.' He was\r\ncertainly not likely to be able to walk in his robes to the House of\r\nLords, or to grace a levee. However, he thanked God he was free from\r\npain. 'Since all my fingers are useless,' he wrote to Hannah More, 'and\r\nthat I have only six hairs left, I am not very much grieved at not being\r\nable to comb my head!' To Hannah More he wrote in all sincerity,\r\nreferring to his elevation to the peerage: 'For the other empty\r\nmetamorphosis that has happened to the outward man, you do me justice in\r\nbelieving that it can do nothing but tease me; it is being called names\r\nin one's old age:' in fact, he reckoned on being styled 'Lord\r\nMethusalem.' He had lived to hear of the cruel deaths of the once gay\r\nand high-born friends whom he had known in Paris, by the guillotine: he\r\nhad lived to execrate the monsters who persecuted the grandest heroine\r\nof modern times, Marie Antoinette, to madness; he lived to censure the\r\ninfatuation of religious zeal in the Birmingham riots. 'Are not the\r\ndevils escaped out of the swine, and overrunning the earth\r\nheadlong?'--he asked in one of his letters.\r\n\r\nHe had offered his hand, and all the ambitious views which it opened, to\r\neach of the Miss Berrys successively, but they refused to bear his name,\r\nthough they still cheered his solitude: and, strange to say, two of the\r\nmost admired and beloved women of their time remained single.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, the sinking invalid was persuaded to remove to Berkeley Square,\r\nto be within reach of good and prompt advice. He consented unwillingly,\r\nfor his 'Gothic Castle' was his favourite abode. He left it with a\r\npresentiment that he should see it no more; but he followed the\r\nproffered advice, and in the spring of the year was established in\r\nBerkeley Square. His mind was still clear. He seems to have cherished to\r\nthe last a concern for that literary fame which he affected to despise.\r\n'Literature has,' he said, 'many revolutions; if an author could rise\r\nfrom the dead, after a hundred years, what would be his surprise at the\r\nadventures of his works! I often say, perhaps my books may be published\r\nin Paternoster Row!' He would indeed have been astonished at the vast\r\ncirculation of his Letters, and the popularity which has carried them\r\ninto every aristocratic family in England. It is remarkable that among\r\nthe middle and lower classes they are far less known, for he was\r\nessentially the chronicler, as well as the wit and beau, of St. James's,\r\nof Windsor, and Richmond.\r\n\r\nAt last he declared that he should 'be content with a sprig of rosemary'\r\nthrown on him when the parson of the parish commits his 'dust to dust.'\r\nThe end of his now suffering existence was near at hand. Irritability,\r\none of the unpitied accompaniments of weakness, seemed to compete with\r\nthe gathering clouds of mental darkness as the last hour drew on. At\r\nintervals there were flashes of a wit that appeared at that solemn\r\nmoment hardly natural, and that must have startled rather than pleased,\r\nthe watchful friends around him. He became unjust in his fretfulness,\r\nand those who loved him most could not wish to see him survive the wreck\r\nof his intellect. Fever came on, and he died on the 2nd of March, 1797.\r\n\r\nHe had collected his letters from his friends: these epistles were\r\ndeposited in two boxes, one marked with an A., the other with a B. The\r\nchest A. was not to be opened until the eldest son of his grandniece,\r\nLady Laura, should attain the age of twenty-five. The chest was found to\r\ncontain memoirs, and bundles of letters ready for publication.\r\n\r\nIt was singular, at the sale of the effects at Strawberry Hill, to see\r\nthis chest, with the MSS. in the clean _Horatian_ hand, and to reflect\r\nhow poignant would have been the anguish of the writer could he have\r\nseen his Gothic Castle given up for fourteen days, to all that could\r\npain the living, or degrade the dead.\r\n\r\nPeace to his manes, prince of letter-writers; prince companion of beaux;\r\nwit of the highest order! Without thy pen, society in the eighteenth\r\ncentury would have been to us almost as dead as the _beau monde_ of\r\nPompeii, or the remains of Etruscan leaders of the ton. Let us not be\r\nungrateful to our Horace: we owe him more than we could ever have\r\ncalculated on before we knew him through his works: prejudiced, he was\r\nnot false; cold, he was rarely cruel; egotistical, he was seldom\r\nvain-glorious. Every age should have a Horace Walpole; every country\r\npossess a chronicler so sure, so keen to perceive, so exact to delineate\r\npeculiarities, manners, characters, and events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE SELWYN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Love of Horrors.--Anecdotes of Selwyn's Mother.--Selwyn's College\r\nDays.--Orator Henley.--Selwyn's Blasphemous Freak.--The Profession\r\nof a Wit.--The Thirst for Hazard.--Reynolds's Conversation-Piece.--\r\nSelwyn's Eccentricities and Witticisms.--A most Important\r\nCommunication.--An Amateur Headsman.--The Eloquence of Indifference.--\r\nCatching a Housebreaker.--The Family of the Selwyns.--The Man of the\r\nPeople.--Selwyn's Parliamentary Career.--True Wit.---Some of Selwyn's\r\nWitty Sayings.--The Sovereignty of the People.--On two kinds of Wit.--\r\nSelwyn's Love for Children.--Mie Mie, the Little Italian.--Selwyn's\r\nLittle Companion taken from him.--His Later Days and Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have heard, at times, of maiden ladies of a certain age who found\r\npleasure in the affection of 'spotted snakes with double tongue, thorny\r\nhedge-hogs, newts, and in live worms.' I frequently meet ladies who\r\nthink conversation lacks interest without the recital of 'melancholy\r\ndeaths,' 'fatal diseases,' and 'mournful cases;' _on ne dispute pas les\r\ngoûts_, and certainly the taste for the night side of nature seems\r\nimmensely prevalent among the lower orders--in whom, perhaps, the\r\nterrible only can rouse from a sullen insensibility. What happy people!\r\nI always think to myself, when I hear of the huge attendance on the last\r\ntragic performance at Newgate; how very little they can see of mournful\r\nand horrible in common life, if they seek it out so eagerly, and relish\r\nit so thoroughly, when they find it! I don't know; for my own part,\r\n_gaudeamus_. I have always thought that the text, 'Blessed are they that\r\nmourn,' referred to the inner private life, not to a perpetual display\r\nof sackcloth and ashes; but I know not. I can understand the\r\nweeping-willow taste among people, who have too little wit or too little\r\nChristianity to be cheerful, but it is a wonder to find the luxury of\r\ngloom united to the keenest perception of the laughable in such a man as\r\nGeorge Selwyn.\r\n\r\nIf human beings could be made pets, like Miss Tabitha's snake or toad,\r\nSelwyn would have fondled a hangman. He loved the noble art of\r\nexecution, and was a connoisseur of the execution of the art. In\r\nchildhood he must have decapitated his rocking-horse, hanged his doll in\r\na miniature gallows, and burnt his baubles at mimic stakes. The man\r\nwhose calm eye was watched for the quiet sparkle that announced--and\r\nonly that ever did announce it--the flashing wit within the mind, by a\r\ngay crowd of loungers at Arthur's, might be found next day rummaging\r\namong coffins in a damp vault, glorying in a mummy, confessing and\r\npreparing a live criminal, paying any sum for a relic of a dead one, or\r\npressing eagerly forward to witness the dying agonies of a condemned\r\nman.\r\n\r\nYet Walpole and Warner both bore the highest testimony to the goodness\r\nof his heart; and it is impossible to doubt that his nature was as\r\ngentle as a woman's. There have been other instances of even educated\r\nmen delighting in scenes of suffering; but in general their characters\r\nhave been more or less gross, their heads more or less insensible. The\r\nhusband of Madame Récamier went daily to see the guillotine do its vile\r\nwork during the reign of Terror; but then he was a man who never wept\r\nover the death of a friend. The man who was devoted to a little child,\r\nwhom he adopted and treated with the tenderest care, was very different\r\nfrom M. Récamier--and that he _had_ a heart there is no doubt. He was an\r\nanomaly, and famous for being so; though, perhaps, his well-known\r\neccentricity was taken advantage of by his witty friends, and many a\r\nstory fathered on Selwyn which has no origin but in the brain of its\r\nnarrator.\r\n\r\nGeorge Augustus Selwyn, then, famous for his wit, and notorious for his\r\nlove of horrors, was the second son of a country gentleman, of Matson,\r\nin Gloucestershire, Colonel John Selwyn, who had been an aide-de-camp of\r\nMarlborough's, and afterwards a frequenter of the courts of the first\r\ntwo Georges. He inherited his wit chiefly from his mother, Mary, the\r\ndaughter of General Farington or Farringdon, of the county of Kent.\r\nWalpole tells us that she figured among the beauties of the court of the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales, and was bedchamber-woman to Queen\r\nCaroline. Her character was not spotless, for we hear of an intrigue,\r\nwhich her own mistress imparted in confidence to the Duchess of Orleans\r\n(the mother of the Regent: they wrote on her tomb _Cy gist l'oisiveté_,\r\nbecause idleness is the _mother_ of all vice), and which eventually\r\nfound its way into the 'Utrecht Gazette.' It was Mrs. Selwyn, too, who\r\nsaid to George II., that he was the last person she would ever have an\r\nintrigue with, because she was sure he would tell the queen of it: it\r\nwas well known that that very virtuous sovereign made his wife the\r\nconfidante of his amours, which was even more shameless than young De\r\nSévigné's taking advice from his mother on his intrigue with Ninon de\r\nl'Enclos. She seems to have been reputed a wit, for Walpole retails her\r\n_mots_ as if they were worth it, but they are not very remarkable: for\r\ninstance, when Miss Pelham lost a pair of diamond earrings, which she\r\nhad borrowed, and tried to faint when the loss was discovered, some one\r\ncalled for lavender-drops as a restorative. 'Pooh!' cries Mrs. Selwyn,\r\n'give her diamond-drops.'\r\n\r\nGeorge Augustus was born on the 11th of August, 1719. Walpole says that\r\nhe knew him at eight years old, and as the two were at Eton about the\r\nsame time, it is presumed that they were contemporaries there. In fact,\r\na list of the boys there, in 1732, furnished to Eliot Warburton,\r\ncontains the names of Walpole, Selwyn, Edgecumbe, and Conway, all in\r\nafter-life intimate friends and correspondents. From Eton to Oxford was\r\nthe natural course, and George was duly entered at Hertford College. He\r\ndid not long grace Alma Mater, for the _grand tour_ had to be made, and\r\nLondon life to be begun, but he was there long enough to contract the\r\nusual Oxford debts, which his father consented to pay more than once. It\r\nis amusing to find the son getting Dr. Newton to write him a contrite\r\nand respectful letter to the angry parent, to liquidate the 'small\r\naccounts' accumulated in London and Oxford as early as 1740. Three years\r\nlater we find him in Paris, leading a gay life, and writing respectful\r\nletters to England for more money. Previously to this, however, he had\r\nobtained, through his father, the sinecure of Clerk of the Irons and\r\nsurveyor of the Meltings at the Mint, a comfortable little appointment,\r\nthe duties of which were performed by deputy, while its holder contented\r\nhimself with honestly acknowledging the salary, and dining once a week,\r\nwhen in town, with the officers of the Mint, and at the Government's\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nSo far the young gentleman went on well enough, but in 1744 he returned\r\nto England, and his rather rampant character showed itself in more than\r\none disgraceful affair.\r\n\r\nAmong the London shows was Orator Henley, a clergyman and clergyman's\r\nson, and a member of St. John's, Cambridge. He had come to London about\r\nthis time, and instituted a series of lectures on universal knowledge\r\nand primitive Christianity. He styled himself a Rationalist, a title\r\nthen more honourable than it is now; and in grandiloquent language,\r\n'spouted' on religious subjects to an audience admitted at a shilling\r\na-head. On one occasion he announced a disputation among any two of his\r\nhearers, offering to give an impartial hearing and judgment to both.\r\nSelwyn and the young Lord Carteret were prepared, and stood up, the one\r\nto defend the ignorance, the other the impudence, of Orator Henley\r\nhimself; so, at least, it is inferred from a passage in D'Israeli the\r\nElder. The uproar that ensued can well be imagined. Henley himself made\r\nhis escape by a back door. His pulpit, all gilt, has been immortalized\r\nby Pope, as 'Henley's gilt tub;' in which--\r\n\r\n  'Imbrown'd with native bronze, lo! Henley stands,\r\n  Tuning his voice and balancing his hands.'\r\n\r\nThe affair gave rise to a correspondence between the Orator and his\r\nyoung friends; who, doubtless, came off best in the matter.\r\n\r\nThis was harmless enough, but George's next freak was not so excusable.\r\nThe circumstances of this affair are narrated in a letter from Captain\r\nNicholson, his friend, to George Selwyn; and may, therefore, be relied\r\non. It appears that being at a certain club in Oxford, at a wine party\r\nwith his friends, George sent to a certain silversmith's for a certain\r\nchalice, intrusted to the shopkeeper from a certain church to be\r\nrepaired in a certain manner. This being brought, Master George--then,\r\nbe it remembered, not at the delicate and frivolous age of most Oxford\r\nboys, but at the mature one of six-and-twenty--filled it with wine, and\r\nhanding it round, used the sacred words, 'Drink this in remembrance of\r\nme.' This was a blasphemous parody of the most sacred rite of the\r\nChurch. All Selwyn could say for himself was, that he was drunk when he\r\ndid it. The other plea, that he did it in ridicule of the\r\ntransubstantiation of the Romish Church, could not stand at all; and was\r\nmost weakly put forward. Let Oxford Dons be what they will; let them put\r\na stop to all religious inquiry, and nearly expel Adam Smith for reading\r\nHume's 'Essay on Human Nature;' let them be, as many allege,\r\nnarrow-minded, hypocritical, and ignorant; we cannot charge them with\r\nwrong-dealing in expelling the originator of such open blasphemy, which\r\nnothing can be found to palliate, and of which its perpetrator did not\r\nappear to repent, rather complaining that the treatment of the Dons was\r\nharsh. The act of expulsion was, of course, considered in the same light\r\nby his numerous acquaintance, many of whom condoled with him on the\r\noccasion. It is true, the Oxford Dons are often charged with injustice\r\nand partiality, and too often the evidence is not sufficiently strong to\r\nexcuse their judgments; but in this the evidence was not denied; only a\r\npalliative was put in, which every one can see through. The only\r\ninjustice we can discover in this case is, that the head of Hart Hall,\r\nas Hertford College was called, seemed to have been influenced in\r\npronouncing his sentence of expulsion by certain previous _suspicions_,\r\nhaving no bearing on the question before him, which had been entertained\r\nby another set of tutors--those of Christchurch--where Selwyn had many\r\nfriends, and where, probably enough, he indulged in many collegian's\r\nfreaks. This knack of bringing up a mere suspicion, is truly\r\ncharacteristic of the Oxford Don, and since the same Head of this\r\nHouse--Dr. Newton--acknowledged that Selwyn was, during his Oxford\r\ncareer, neither intemperate, dissolute, nor a gamester, it is fair to\r\ngive him the advantage of the doubt, that the judgment on the evidence\r\nhad been influenced by the consideration of 'suspicions' of former\r\nmisdeeds, which had not been proved, perhaps never committed. Knowing\r\nthe after-life of the man, we can, however, scarcely doubt that George\r\nhad led a fast life at the University, and given cause for mistrust. But\r\none may ask whether Dons, whose love of drinking, and whose tendency to\r\njest on the most solemn subjects, are well known even in the present\r\nday, might not have treated Selwyn less harshly for what was done under\r\nthe influence of wine? To this we are inclined to reply, that no\r\npunishment is too severe for profanation; and that drunkenness is not an\r\nexcuse, but an aggravation. Selwyn threatened to appeal, and took advice\r\non the matter. This, as usual, was vain. Many an expelled man, more\r\nunjustly treated than Selwyn, has talked of appeal in vain. Appeal to\r\nwhom? To what? Appeal against men who never acknowledge themselves\r\nwrong, and who, to maintain that they are right, will listen to evidence\r\nwhich they can see is contradictory, and which they know to be\r\nworthless! An appeal from an Oxford decision is as hopeless in the\r\npresent day as it was in Selwyn's. He wisely left it alone, but less\r\nwisely insisted on reappearing in Oxford, against the advice of all his\r\nfriends, whose characters were lost if the ostracised man were seen\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nFrom this time he entered upon his 'profession,' that of a wit, gambler,\r\nclub-lounger, and man about town; for these many characters are all\r\nmixed in the one which is generally called 'a wit.' Let us remember that\r\nhe was good-hearted, and not ill-intentioned, though imbued with the\r\nfalse ideas of his day. He was not a great man, but a great wit.\r\n\r\nThe localities in which the trade of wit was plied were, then, the\r\nclubs, and the drawing-rooms of fashionable beauties. The former were in\r\nSelwyn's youth still limited in the number of their members, thirty\r\nconstituting a large club; and as the subscribers were all known to one\r\nanother, presented an admirable field for display of mental powers in\r\nconversation. In fact, the early clubs were nothing more than\r\ndining-societies, precisely the same in theory as our breakfasting\r\narrangements at Oxford, which were every whit as exclusive, though not\r\nballoted for. The ballot, however, and the principle of a single black\r\nball suffering to negative an election were not only, under such\r\ncircumstances, excusable, but even necessary for the actual preservation\r\nof peace. Of course, in a succession of dinner-parties, if any two\r\nmembers were at all opposed to one other, the awkwardness would be\r\nintolerable. In the present day, two men may belong to the same club and\r\nscarcely meet even on the stairs, oftener than once or twice in a\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, in the place of the 'feast of reason and flow of\r\nsoul' and wine, instead of the evenings spent in toasting, talking,\r\nemptying bottles and filling heads, as in the case of the old Kit-kat,\r\nmen took to the monstrous amusement of examining fate, and on\r\nclub-tables the dice rattled far more freely than the glasses, though\r\nthese latter were not necessarily abandoned. Then came the thirst for\r\nhazard that brought men early in the day to try their fortune, and thus\r\nmade the club-room a lounge. Selwyn was an habitual frequenter of\r\nBrookes.'\r\n\r\nBrookes' was, perhaps, the principal club of the day, though 'White's\r\nChocolate House' was almost on a par with it. But Selwyn did not confine\r\nhis attention solely to this club. It was the fashion to belong to as\r\nmany of them as possible, and Wilberforce mentions no less than five to\r\nwhich he himself belonged: Brookes', Boodle's, White's, Miles and\r\nEvans's in New Palace Yard, and Goosetree's. As their names imply, these\r\nwere all, originally, mere coffee-houses, kept by men of the above\r\nnames. One or two rooms then sufficed for the requirements of a small\r\nparty, and it was not till the members were greatly increased that the\r\ncoffee-house rose majestically to the dignity of a bow-window, and was\r\nentirely and exclusively appropriated to the requirements of the club.\r\n\r\nThis was especially the case with White's, of which so many of the wits\r\nand talkers of Selwyn's day were members. Who does not know that\r\nbow-window at the top of St. James's Street, where there are sure, about\r\nthree or four in the afternoon, to be at least three gentlemen, two old\r\nand one young, standing, to the exclusion of light within, talking and\r\ncontemplating the oft-repeated movement outside. White's was established\r\nas early as 1698, and was thus one of the original coffee-houses. It was\r\nthen kept by a man named Arthur: here Chesterfield gamed and talked, to\r\nbe succeeded by Gilly Williams. Charles Townshend, and George Selwyn.\r\nThe old house was burnt down in 1733. It was at White's--or as Hogarth\r\ncalls it in his pictorial squib, Black's--that, when a man fell dead at\r\nthe door, he was lugged in and bets made as to whether he was dead or\r\nno. The surgeon's operations were opposed, for fear of disturbing the\r\nbets. Here, too, did George Selwyn and Charles Townshend pit their wit\r\nagainst wit; and here Pelham passed all the time he was not forced to\r\ndevote to politics. In short it was, next to Brookes', the club of the\r\nday, and perhaps in some respects had a greater renown than even that\r\nfamous club, and its play was as high.\r\n\r\nIn Brookes' and White's Selwyn appeared with a twofold fame, that of a\r\npronouncer of _bon-mots_ and that of a lover of horrors. His wit was of\r\nthe quaintest order. He was no inveterate talker, like Sydney Smith; no\r\nclever dissimulator, like Mr. Hook. Calmly, almost sanctimoniously, he\r\nuttered those neat and telling sayings which the next day passed over\r\nEngland as 'Selwyn's last.' Walpole describes his manner admirably---his\r\neyes turned up, his mouth set primly, a look almost of melancholy in his\r\nwhole face. Reynolds, in his Conversation-piece, celebrated when in the\r\nStrawberry Collection, and representing Selwyn leaning on a chair, Gilly\r\nWilliams, crayon in hand, and Dick Edgecumbe by his side, has caught the\r\npseudo-solemn expression of his face admirably. The ease of the figure,\r\none hand _empochée_, the other holding a paper of epigrams, or what not,\r\nthe huge waistcoat with a dozen buttons and huge flaps, the ruffled\r\nsleeve, the bob-wig, all belong to the outer man; but the calm, quiet,\r\nalmost enquiring face, the look half of melancholy, half of reproach,\r\nand, as the Milesian would say, the other half of sleek wisdom; the long\r\nnose, the prim mouth and joined lips, the elevated brow, and beneath it\r\nthe quiet contemplative eye, contemplative not of heaven or hell, but of\r\nthis world as it had seen it, in its most worldly point of view, yet\r\ntwinkling with a flashing thought of incongruity made congruous, are the\r\nindices of the inner man. Most of our wits, it must have been seen, have\r\nhad some other interest and occupation in life than that of 'making\r\nwit:' some have been authors, some statesmen, some soldiers, some\r\nwild-rakes, and some players of tricks: Selwyn had no profession but\r\nthat of _diseur de bons mots_; for though he sat in the House, ne took\r\nno prominent part in politics; though he gambled extensively, he did not\r\ngame for the sake of money only. Thus his life was that merely of a\r\nLondon bachelor, with few incidents to mark it, and therefore his memoir\r\nmust resolve itself more or less into a series of anecdotes of his\r\neccentricities and list of his witticisms.\r\n\r\nHis friend Walpole gives us an immense number of both, not all of a\r\nfirst-rate nature, nor many interesting in the present day. Selwyn, calm\r\nas he was, brought out his sayings on the spur of the moment, and their\r\nappropriateness to the occasion was one of their greatest\r\nrecommendations. A good saying, like a good sermon, depends much on its\r\ndelivery, and loses much in print. Nothing less immortal than wit! To\r\ntake first, however, the eccentricities of his character, and especially\r\nhis love of horrors, we find anecdotes by the dozen retailed of him. It\r\nwas so well known, that Lord Holland, when dying, ordered his servant to\r\nbe sure to admit Mr. Selwyn if he called to enquire after him, 'for if I\r\nam alive,' said he, 'I shall be glad to see him, and if I am dead, he\r\nwill be glad to see me.' The name of Holland leads us to an anecdote\r\ntold by Walpole. Selwyn was looking over Cornbury with Lord Abergavenny\r\nand Mrs. Frere, 'who loved one another a little,' and was disgusted with\r\nthe frivolity of the woman who could take no interest in anything worth\r\nseeing. 'You don't know what you missed in the other room,' he cried at\r\nlast, peevishly. 'Why, what?'--'Why, my Lord Holland's picture.'--'Well,\r\nwhat is my Lord Holland to me?' 'Don't you know,' whispered the wit\r\nmysteriously, 'that Lord Holland's body lies in the same vault in\r\nKensington Church with my Lord Abergavenny's mother?' 'Lord! she was so\r\nobliged,' says Walpole, 'and thanked him a thousand times!'\r\n\r\nSelwyn knew the vaults as thoroughly as old Anthony Wood knew the\r\nbrasses. The elder Craggs had risen by the favour of Marlborough, whose\r\nfootman he had been, and his son was eventually a Secretary of State.\r\nArthur Moore, the father of James Moore Smyth, of whom Pope wrote--\r\n\r\n  'Arthur, whose giddy son neglects the laws,\r\n  Imputes to me and my damned works the cause'\r\n\r\nhad worn a livery too. When Craggs got into a coach with him, he\r\nexclaimed, 'Why, Arthur, I am always getting up behind, are not you?'\r\nWalpole having related this story to Selwyn, the latter told him, as a\r\nmost important communication, that Arthur Moore had had his coffin\r\nchained to that of his mistress. 'Lord! how do you know?' asked Horace.\r\n'Why, I saw them the other day in a vault at St. Giles's.' 'Oh! Your\r\nservant, Mr. Selwyn,' cried the man who showed the tombs at Westminster\r\nAbbey, 'I expected to see _you_ here the other day when the old Duke of\r\nRichmond's body was taken up.'\r\n\r\nCriminals were, of course, included in his passion. Walpole affirms that\r\nhe had a great share in bringing Lord Dacre's footman, who had murdered\r\nthe butler, to confess his crime. In writing the confession, the\r\ningenious plush coolly stopped and asked how 'murdered' was spelt. But\r\nit mattered little to George whether the criminal were alive or dead,\r\nand he defended his eccentric taste with his usual wit; when rallied by\r\nsome women for going to see the Jacobite Lord Lovat's head cut off, he\r\nretorted, sharply--'I made full amends, for I went to see it sewn on\r\nagain.' He had indeed done so, and given the company at the undertaker's\r\na touch of his favourite blasphemy, for when the man of coffins had done\r\nhis work and laid the body in its box, Selwyn, imitating the voice of\r\nthe Lord Chancellor at the trial, muttered, 'My Lord Lovat, you may\r\n_rise_.' He said a better thing on the trial of a confederate of\r\nLovat's, that Lord Kilmarnock, with whom the ladies fell so desperately\r\nin love as he stood on his defence. Mrs. Bethel, who was famous for a\r\n_hatchet-face,_ was among the fair spectators: 'What a shame it is,'\r\nquoth the wit, 'to turn her face to the prisoners before they are\r\ncondemned!' Terrible, indeed, was that instrument of death to those men,\r\nwho had in the heat of battle so gallantly met sword and blunderbuss.\r\nThe slow, sure approach of the day of the scaffold was a thousand times\r\nworse than the roar of cannon. Lord Cromarty was pardoned, solely, it\r\nwas said, from pity for his poor wife, who was at the time of the trial\r\nfar advanced in pregnancy. It was affirmed that the child born had a\r\ndistinct mark of an axe on his neck. _Credat Judæus_! Walpole used to\r\nsay that Selwyn never thought but _à la tête tranchée_, and that when he\r\nwent to have a tooth drawn, he told the dentist he would drop his\r\nhandkerchief by way of signal. Certain it is that he did love an\r\nexecution, whatever he or his friends may have done to remove the\r\nimpression of this extraordinary taste. Some better men than Selwyn have\r\nhad the same, and Macaulay accuses Penn of a similar affection. The best\r\nknown anecdote of Selwyn's peculiarity relates to the execution of\r\nDamiens, who was torn with red-hot pincers, and finally quartered by\r\nfour horses, for the attempt to assassinate Louis XV. On the day fixed,\r\nGeorge mingled with the crowd plainly dressed, and managed to press\r\nforward close to the place of torture. The executioner observing him,\r\neagerly cried out, '_Faites place pour Monsieur; c'est un Anglais et un\r\namateur_;' or, as another version goes, he was asked if he was not\r\nhimself a _bourreau_.--'_Non, Monsieur,_' he is said to have answered,\r\n'_je n'ai pas cet honneur, je ne suis qu'un amateur._' The story is more\r\nthan apocryphal, for Selwyn is not the only person of whom it has been\r\ntold; and he was even accused, according to Wraxall, of going to\r\nexecutions in female costume. George Selwyn must have passed as a\r\n'remarkably fine woman,' in that case.\r\n\r\nIt is only justice to him to say that the many stories of his attending\r\nexecutions were supposed to be inventions of Sir Charles Hanbury\r\nWilliams, another wit, and of Chesterfield, another, and a rival. In\r\nconfirmation, it is adduced that when the former had been relating some\r\nnew account, and an old friend of Selwyn's expressed his surprise that\r\nhe had never heard the tale before, the hero of it replied quietly, 'No\r\nwonder at all, for Sir Charles has just invented it, and knows that I\r\nwill not by contradiction spoil the pleasure of the company he is so\r\nhighly entertaining.'\r\n\r\nWit has been called 'the eloquence of indifference;' no one seems ever\r\nto have been so indifferent about everything, but his little daughter,\r\nas George Selwyn. He always, however, took up the joke, and when asked\r\nwhy he had not been to see one Charles Fox, a low criminal, hanged at\r\nTyburn, answered, quietly, 'I make a point of never going to\r\n_rehearsals_.'\r\n\r\nSelwyn's love for this kind of thing, to believe his most intimate\r\nfriend, Horace Walpole, was quite a fact. His friend relates that he\r\neven bargained for the High Sheriff's wand, after it was broken, at the\r\ncondemnation of the gallant Lords, but said, 'that he behaved so like an\r\nattorney the first day, and so like a pettifogger the second, that he\r\nwould not take it to light his fire with.'\r\n\r\nThe State Trials, of course, interested George more than any other in\r\nhis eventless life; he dined after the sentence with the celebrated Lady\r\nTownshend, who was so devoted to Lord Kilmarnock--\r\n\r\n  'Pitied by gentle minds, Kilmarnock died'--Johnson.\r\n\r\nthat she is said to have even stayed under his windows, when he was in\r\nprison; but he treated her anxiety with such lightness that the lady\r\nburst into tears, and 'flung up-stairs.' 'George,' writes Walpole to\r\nMontague, 'cooly took Mrs. Dorcas, her woman, and bade her sit down to\r\nfinish the bottle.--\"And pray,\" said Dorcas, \"do you think my lady will\r\nbe prevailed upon to let me go and see the execution? I have a friend\r\nthat has promised to take care of me, and I can lie in the Tower the\r\nnight before.\" Could she have talked so pleasantly to Selwyn?'\r\n\r\nHis contemporaries certainly believed in his love for Newgatism; for\r\nwhen Walpole had caught a housebreaker in a neighbour's area, he\r\nimmediately despatched a messenger to White's for the philo-criminalist,\r\nwho was sure to be playing at the Club any time before daylight. It\r\nhappened that the drawer at the 'Chocolate-house' had been himself\r\nlately robbed, and therefore stole to George with fear and trembling,\r\nand muttered mysteriously to him, 'Mr. Walpole's compliments, and he has\r\ngot a housebreaker for you.' Of course Selwyn obeyed the summons\r\nreadily, and the event concluded, as such events do nine times out of\r\nten, with a quiet capture, and much ado about nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Selwyns were a powerful family in Gloucestershire, owning a great\r\ndeal of property in the neighbourhood of Gloucester itself. The old\r\ncolonel had represented that city in Parliament for many years. On the\r\n5th of November, 1751, he died. His eldest son had gone a few months\r\nbefore him. This son had been also at Eton, and was an early friend of\r\nHorace Walpole and General Conway. His death left George sole heir to\r\nthe property, and very much he seemed to have needed the heritage.\r\n\r\nThe property of the Selwyns lay in the picturesque district of the\r\nNorthern Cotswolds. Anybody who has passed a day in the dull city of\r\nGloucester, which seems to break into anything like life only at an\r\nelection, lying dormant in the intervals, has been glad to rush out to\r\nenjoy air and a fine view on Robin Hood's Hill, a favourite walk with\r\nthe worthy citizens, though what the jovial archer of merry Sherwood had\r\nto do with it, or whether he was ever in Gloucestershire at all, I\r\nprofess I know not. Walpole describes the hill with humorous\r\nexaggeration. 'It is lofty enough for an alp, yet is a mountain of turf\r\nto the very top, has wood scattered all over it, springs that long to be\r\ncascades in many places of it, and from the summit it beats even Sir\r\nGeorge Littleton's views, by having the city of Gloucester at its foot,\r\nand the Severn widening to the horizon.' On the very summit of the next\r\nhill, Chosen-down, is a solitary church, and the legend saith that the\r\ngood people who built it did so originally at the foot of the steep\r\nmount, but that the Virgin Mary carried up the stones by night, till the\r\nbuilder, in despair, was compelled to erect it on the top. Others\r\nattribute the mysterious act to a very different personage, and with\r\napparently more reason, for the position of the church must keep many an\r\nold sinner from hearing service.\r\n\r\nAt Matson, then, on Robin Hood's Hill, the Selwyns lived; Walpole says\r\nthat the 'house is small, but neat. King Charles lay here at the seige,\r\nand the Duke of York, with typical fury, hacked and hewed the\r\nwindow-shutters of his chamber as a memorandum of his being there. And\r\nhere is the very flowerpot and counterfeit association for which Bishop\r\nSprat was taken up, and the Duke of Marlborough sent to the Tower. The\r\nreservoirs on the hill supply the city. The late Mr. Selwyn governed the\r\nborough by them--and I believe by some wine too.' Probably, or at least\r\nby some beer, if the modern electors be not much altered from their\r\nforefathers.\r\n\r\nBesides this important estate, the Selwyns had another at Ludgershall,\r\nand their influence there was so complete, that they might fairly be\r\nsaid to _give_ one seat to any one they chose. With such double barrels\r\nGeorge Selwyn was, of course, a great gun in the House, but his interest\r\nlay far more in piquet and pleasantry than in politics and patriotism,\r\nand he was never fired off with any but the blank cartridges of his two\r\nvotes. His parliamentary career, begun in 1747, lasted more than forty\r\nyears, yet was entirely without distinction. He, however, amused both\r\nparties with his wit, and by _snoring in unison_ with Lord North. This\r\nmust have been trying to Mr. Speaker Cornwall, who was longing, no\r\ndoubt, to snore also, and dared not. He was probably the only Speaker\r\nwho presided over so august an assembly as our English Parliament with a\r\npewter pot of porter at his elbow, sending for more and more to\r\nBellamy's till his heavy eyes closed of themselves. A modern M.P.,\r\ncarried back by some fancies to 'the Senate' of those days, might\r\nreasonably doubt whether his guide had not taken him by mistake to some\r\nCoal-hole or Cider-cellar, presided over by some former Baron Nicholson,\r\nand whether the furious eloquence of Messrs. Fox, Pitt, and Burke were\r\nnot got up for the amusement of an audience admitted at sixpence a head.\r\n\r\nSelwyn's political jokes were the delight of Bellamy's! He said that Fox\r\nand Pitt reminded him of Hogarth's Idle and Industrious Apprentices.\r\nWhen asked by some one, as he sauntered out of the house--'Is the House\r\nup?' he replied; 'No, but Burke is.' The length of Burke's elaborate\r\nspoken essays was proverbial, and obtained for him the name of the\r\n'Dinner-bell.' Fox was talking one day at Brookes' of the advantageous\r\npeace he had made with France, and that he had even induced that country\r\nto give up the _gum_ trade to England. 'That, Charles,' quoth Selwyn,\r\nsharply, 'I am not at all surprised at; for having drawn your _teeth_,\r\nthey would be d----d fools to quarrel with you about gums.' Fox was\r\noften the object of his good-natured satire. As every one knows, his\r\nboast was to be called 'The Man of the People,' though perhaps he cared\r\nas little for the great unwashed as for the wealth and happiness of the\r\nwaiters at his clubs.' Every one knows, too, what a dissolute life he\r\nled for many years. Selwyn's sleepiness was well known. He slept in the\r\nHouse; he slept, after losing £8oo 'and with as many more before him,'\r\nupon the gaming-table, with the dice-box 'stamped close to his ears;' he\r\nslept, or half-slept, even in conversation, which he seems to have\r\ncaught by fits and starts. Thus it was that words he heard suggested\r\ndifferent senses, partly from being only dimly associated with the\r\nsubject on the _tapis_. So, when, they were talking around of the war,\r\nand whether it should be a sea war or a Continent war, Selwyn woke up\r\njust enough to say, 'I am for a sea war and a _Continent_ admiral.'\r\n\r\nWhen Fox had ruined himself, and a subscription for him was talked of,\r\nsome one asked how they thought 'he would take it.'--'Take it,' cried\r\nSelwyn, suddenly lighting up, 'why, _quarterly_ to be sure.'\r\n\r\nHis parliamentary career was then quite uneventful; but at the\r\ndissolution in 1780, he found that his security at Gloucester was\r\nthreatened. He was not Whig enough for that constituency, and had\r\nthroughout supported the war with America. He offered himself, of\r\ncourse, but was rejected with scorn, and forced to fly for a seat to\r\nLudgershall. Walpole writes to Lady Ossory: 'They' (the Gloucester\r\npeople) 'hanged him in effigy, and dressed up a figure of Mie-Mie' (his\r\nadopted daughter), 'and pinned on its breast these words, alluding to\r\nthe gallows:--\"This is what I told you you would come to!\"' From\r\nGloucester he went to Ludgershall, where he was received by ringing of\r\nbells and bonfires. 'Being driven out of my capital,' said he, 'and\r\ncoming into that country of turnips, where I was adored, I seemed to be\r\narrived in my Hanoverian dominions'--no bad hit at George II. For\r\nLudgershall he sat for many years, with Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, whose\r\n'Memoirs' are better known than trusted, as colleague. That writer says\r\nof Selwyn, that he was 'thoroughly well versed in our history, and\r\nmaster of many curious as well as secret anecdotes, relative to the\r\nhouses of Stuart and Brunswick.'\r\n\r\nAnother _bon-mot_, not in connection with politics, is reported by\r\nWalpole as incomparable.' Lord George Gordon asked him if the\r\nLudgershall electors would take him (Lord George) for Ludgershall,\r\nadding, 'if you would recommend me, they would choose me, if I came from\r\nthe coast of Africa.'--'That is according to what part of the coast you\r\ncame from; they would certainly, if you came from the Guinea coast.'\r\n'Now, Madam,' writes his friend, 'is not this true inspiration as well\r\nas true wit? Had any one asked him in which of the four quarters of the\r\nworld Guinea is situated, could he have told?' Walpole did not perhaps\r\nknow master George thoroughly--he was neither so ignorant nor so\r\nindifferent as he seemed. His manner got him the character of being\r\nboth; but he was a still fool that ran deep.\r\n\r\nThough Selwyn did little with his two votes, he made them pay; and in\r\naddition to the post in the Mint, got out of the party he supported\r\nthose of Registrar to the Court of Chancery in the Island of Barbadoes,\r\na sinecure done by deputy, Surveyor of the Crown Lands, and Paymaster to\r\nthe Board of Works. The wits of White's added the title of\r\n'Receiver-General of Waif and Stray Jokes.' It is said that his\r\nhostility to Sheridan arose from the latter having lost him the office\r\nin the Works in 1782, when Burke's Bill for reducing the Civil List came\r\ninto operation; but this is not at all probable, as his dislike was\r\nshown long before that period. Apropos of the Board of Works, Walpole\r\ngives another anecdote. On one occasion, in 1780, Lord George Gordon had\r\nbeen the only opponent on a division. Selwyn afterwards took him in his\r\ncarriage to White's. 'I have brought,' said he, 'the whole Opposition in\r\nmy coach, and I hope one coach will always hold them, if they mean to\r\ntake away the Board of Works.'\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, Selwyn's wit wanted the manner of the man to make it so\r\npopular, for, as we read it, it is often rather mild. To string a list\r\nof them together:--Lady Coventry showed him her new dress all covered\r\nwith spangles as large as shillings. 'Bless my soul,' said he, 'you'll\r\nbe change for a guinea.'\r\n\r\nFox, debtor and bankrupt as he was, had taken lodgings with Fitzpatrick\r\nat an oilman's in Piccadilly. Every one pitied the landlord, who would\r\ncertainly be ruined. 'Not a bit of it,' quoth George; 'he'll have the\r\ncredit of keeping at his house the finest pickles in London.'\r\n\r\nSometimes there was a good touch of satire on his times. When 'High Life\r\nBelow Stairs' was first acted, Selwyn vowed he would go and see it, for\r\nhe was sick of low life above stairs; and when a waiter at his Club had\r\nbeen convicted of felony, 'What a horrid idea,' said he, 'the man will\r\ngive of _us_ in Newgate!'\r\n\r\nDining with Bruce, the Abyssinian traveller, he heard him say, in answer\r\nto a question about musical instruments in the East, 'I believe I saw\r\none _lyre_ there.'--'Ay,' whispered the wit to his neighbour, 'and\r\nthere's one less since he left the country.' Bruce shared the\r\ntravellers' reputation of drawing the long-bow to a very considerable\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nTwo of Selwyn's best _mots_ were about one of the Foley family, who were\r\nso deeply in debt that they had 'to go to Texas,' or Boulogne, to escape\r\nthe money-lenders. 'That,' quoth Selwyn, 'is a _pass-over_ which will\r\nnot be much relished by the Jews.' And again, when it was said that they\r\nwould be able to cancel their father's old will by a new-found one, he\r\nprofanely indulged in a pun far too impious to be repeated in our day,\r\nhowever it may have been relished in Selwyn's time.\r\n\r\nA picture called 'The Daughter of Pharaoh' in which the Princess Royal\r\nand her attendant ladies figured as the saver of Moses and her\r\nhandmaids, was being exhibited in 1782, at a house opposite Brookes',\r\nand was to be the companion-piece to Copley's 'Death of Chatham.' George\r\nsaid he could recommend a better companion, to wit--the 'Sons of\r\nPharaoh' at the opposite house. It is scarcely necessary to explain that\r\npharaoh or faro was the most popular game of hazard then played.\r\n\r\nWalking one day with Lord Pembroke, and being besieged by a troop of\r\nsmall chimney-climbers, begging--Selwyn, after bearing their importunity\r\nvery calmly for some time, suddenly turned round, and with the most\r\nserious face thus addressed them--'I have often heard of the sovereignty\r\nof the people; I suppose your highnesses are in Court mourning,' We can\r\nwell imagine the effect of this sedate speech on the astonished\r\nyoungsters.\r\n\r\nPelham's truculency was well known. Walpole and his\r\nfriend went to the sale of his plate in 1755. 'Lord,' said the wit, 'how\r\nmany toads have been eaten off these plates!'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SELWYN ACKNOWLEDGES THE \"SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE.\"]\r\n\r\nThe jokes were not always very delicate. When, in the middle of the\r\nsummer of 1751, Lord North, who had been twice married before, espoused\r\nthe widow of the Earl of Rockingham, who was fearfully stout, Selwyn\r\nsuggested that she had been kept in ice for three days before the\r\nwedding. So, too, when there was talk of another _embonpoint_ personage\r\ngoing to America during the war, he remarked that she would make a\r\ncapital _breast_-work.\r\n\r\nOne of the few epigrams he ever wrote--if not the only one, of which\r\nthere is some doubt--was in the same spirit. It is on the discovery of a\r\npair of shoes in a certain lady's bed--\r\n\r\n  Well may Suspicion shake its head--\r\n  Well may Clorinda's spouse be jealous,\r\n  When the dear wanton takes to bed\r\n  Her very shoes--because they're fellows.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few specimens of George Selwyn's wit; and dozens more are\r\ndispersed though Walpole's Letters. As Eliot Warburton remarks, they do\r\nnot give us a very high idea of the humour of the period; but two things\r\nmust be taken into consideration before we deprecate their author's\r\ntitle to the dignity and reputation he enjoyed so abundantly among his\r\ncontemporaries; they are not necessarily the _best_ specimens that might\r\nhave been given, if more of his _mots_ had been preserved; and their\r\neffect on his listeners depended more on the manner of delivery than on\r\nthe matter. That they were improvised and unpremeditated is another\r\nimportant consideration. It is quite unfair to compare them, as\r\nWarburton does, with the hebdomadal trash of 'Punch,' though perhaps\r\nthey would stand the comparison pretty well. It is one thing to force\r\nwit with plenty of time to invent and meditate it--another to have so\r\nmuch wit within you that you can bring it out on any occasion; one thing\r\nto compose a good fancy for _money_--another to utter it only when it\r\nflashes through the brain.\r\n\r\nBut it matters little what we in the present day may think of Selwyn's\r\nwit, for conversation is spoiled by bottling, and should be drawn fresh\r\nwhen wanted. Selwyn's companions--all men of wit, more or less, affirmed\r\nhim to be the most amusing man of his day, and that was all the part he\r\nhad to play. No real wit ever hopes to _talk_ for posterity; and written\r\nwit is of a very different character to the more sparkling, if less\r\nsolid, creations of a moment.\r\n\r\nWe have seen Selwyn in many points of view, not all very creditable to\r\nhim; first, expelled from Oxford for blasphemy; next, a professed\r\ngambler and the associate of men who led fashion in those days, it is\r\ntrue, but then it was very bad fashion; then as a lover of hangmen, a\r\nwit and a lounger. There is reason to believe that Selwyn, though less\r\nopenly reprobate than many of his associates, was, in his quiet way,\r\njust as bad as any of them, if we except the Duke of Queensberry, his\r\nintimate friend, or the disgusting 'Franciscans' of Medmenham Abbey, of\r\nwhom, though not the founder, nor even a member, he was, in a manner,\r\nthe suggester in his blasphemy.\r\n\r\nBut Selwyn's real character is only seen in profile in all these\r\naccounts. He had at the bottom of such vice, to which his position, and\r\nthe fashion of the day introduced him, a far better heart than any of\r\nhis contemporaries, and in some respects a kind of simplicity which was\r\nendearing. He was neither knave nor fool. He was not a voluptuary, like\r\nhis friend the duke; nor a continued drunkard, like many other 'fine\r\ngentlemen' with whom he mixed; nor a cheat, though a gambler; nor a\r\nsceptic, like his friend Walpole; nor a blasphemer, like the Medmenham\r\nset, though he had once parodied profanely a sacred rite; nor was he\r\nsteeped in debt, as Fox was; nor does he appear to have been a practised\r\nseducer, as too many of his acquaintance were. Not that these negative\r\nqualities are to his praise; but if we look at the age and the society\r\naround him, we must, at least, admit that Selwyn was not one of the\r\nworst of that wicked set.\r\n\r\nBut the most pleasing point in the character of the old bachelor--for he\r\nwas _too much_ of a wit ever to marry--is his affection for\r\nchildren--not his own. That is, not avowedly his own, for it was often\r\nsuspected that the little ones he took up so fondly bore some\r\nrelationship to him, and there can be little doubt that Selwyn, like\r\neverybody else in that evil age, had his intrigues. He did not die in\r\nhis sins, and that is almost all we can say for him. He gave up gaming\r\nin time, protesting that it was the bane of four much better\r\nthings--health, money, time, and thinking. For the last two, perhaps, he\r\ncared little. Before his death he is said to have been a Christian,\r\nwhich was a decided rarity in the fashionable set of his day. Walpole\r\nanswered, when asked if he was a Freemason, that he never had been\r\n_anything_, and probably most of the men of the time would, if they had\r\nhad the honesty, have said the same. They were not atheists professedly,\r\nbut they neither believed in nor practised Christianity.\r\n\r\nHis love for children has been called one of his eccentricities. It\r\nwould be a hard name to give it if he had not been a club-lounger of his\r\nday. I have sufficient faith in human nature to trust that two-thirds of\r\nthe men of this country have that most amiable eccentricity. But in\r\nSelwyn it amounted to something more than in the ordinary paterfamilias:\r\nit was almost a passion. He was almost motherly in his celibate\r\ntenderness to the little ones to whom he took a fancy. This affection he\r\nshowed to several of the children, sons or daughters, of his friends;\r\nbut to two especially, Anne Coventry and Maria Fagniani.\r\n\r\nThe former was the daughter of the beautiful Maria Gunning, who became\r\nCountess of Coventry. Nanny, as he called her, was four years old when\r\nher mother died, and from that time he treated her almost as his own\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nBut Mie-Mie, as the little Italian was called, was far more favoured.\r\nWhoever may have been the child's father, her mother was a rather\r\nbeautiful and very immoral woman, the wife of the Marchese Fagniani. She\r\nseems to have desired to make the most for her daughter out of the\r\nextraordinary rivalry of the two English 'gentlemen,' and they were\r\nadmirably taken in by her. Whatever the truth may have been, Selwyn's\r\nlove for children showed itself more strongly in this case than in any\r\nother; and, oddly enough, it seems to have begun when the little girl\r\nwas at an age when children scarcely interest other men than their\r\nfathers--in short, in infancy. Her parents allowed him to have the sole\r\ncharge of her at a very early age, when they returned to the Continent;\r\nbut in 1777, the marchioness, being then in Brussels, claimed her\r\ndaughter back again; though less, it seems, from any great anxiety on\r\nthe child's account, than because her husband's parents, in Milan,\r\nobjected to their grand-daughter being left in England; and also, not a\r\nlittle, from fear of the voice of Mrs. Grundy. Selwyn seems to have used\r\nall kinds of arguments to retain the child; and a long correspondence\r\ntook place, which the marchesa begins with, 'My very dear friend,' and\r\nmany affectionate expressions, and concludes with a haughty 'Sir,' and\r\nher opinion that his conduct was 'devilish.' The affair was, therefore,\r\nclearly a violent quarrel, and Selwyn was obliged at last to give up the\r\nchild. He had a carriage fitted up for her expressly for her journey;\r\nmade out for her a list of the best hotels on her route; sent his own\r\nconfidential man-servant with her, and treasured up among his 'relics'\r\nthe childish little notes, in a large scrawling hand, which Mie-Mie sent\r\nhim. Still more curious was it to see this complete man of the world,\r\nthis gambler for many years, this club-lounger, drinker, associate of\r\nwell-dressed blasphemers, of Franciscans of Medmenham Abbey, devoting,\r\nnot his money only, but his very time to this mere child, leaving town\r\nin the height of the season for dull Matson, that she might have fresh\r\nair; quitting his hot club-rooms, his nights spent at the piquet-table,\r\nand the rattle of the dice, for the quiet, pleasant terraces of his\r\ncountry-house, where he would hold the little innocent Mie-Mie by her\r\ntiny hand, as she looked up into his shrivelled dissipated face;\r\nquitting the interchange of wit, the society of the Townshends, the\r\nWalpoles, the Williamses, the Edgecumbes; all the jovial, keen wisdom of\r\nGilly, and Dick, and Horace, and Charles, as they called one another,\r\nfor the meaningless prattle, the merry laughter of this half-English,\r\nhalf-Italian child, It redeems Selwyn in our eyes, and it may have done\r\nhim real good: nay, he must have felt a keen refreshment in this change\r\nfrom vice to innocence; and we understand the misery he expressed, when\r\nthe old bachelor's one little companion and only pure friend was taken\r\naway from him. His love for the child was well known in London society;\r\nand of it did Sheridan's friends take advantage, when they wanted to get\r\nSelwyn out of Brookes', to prevent his black-balling the dramatist. The\r\nanecdote is given in the next memoir.\r\n\r\nIn his later days Selwyn still haunted the clubs, hanging about, sleepy,\r\nshrivelled, dilapidated in face and figure, yet still respected and\r\ndreaded by the youngsters, as the 'celebrated Mr. Selwyn.' The wit's\r\ndisease--gout--carried him off at last, in 1791, at the age of\r\nseventy-two.\r\n\r\nHe left a fortune which was not contemptible: £33,000 of it were to go\r\nto Mie-Mie--by this time a young lady--and as the Duke of Queensberry,\r\nat his death, left her no less than £150,000, Miss was by no means a bad\r\nmatch for Lord Yarmouth.[6] See what a good thing it is to have three\r\npapas, when two of them are rich! The duke made Lord Yarmouth his\r\nresiduary legatee, and between him and his wife divided nearly\r\nhalf-a-million.\r\n\r\n[6: Afterwards the well-known and dissolute Marquis of Hertford.]\r\n\r\nLet us not forget in closing this sketch of George Selwyn's life, that,\r\ngambler and reprobate as he was, he possessed some good traits, among\r\nwhich his love of children appears in shining colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\nSheridan a Dunce.--Boyish Dreams of Literary Fame.--Sheridan in Love.--A\r\nNest of Nightingales.--The 'Maid of Bath.'--Captivated by Genius.--\r\nSheridan's Elopement with 'Cecilia.'--His Duel with Captain Matthews.--\r\nStandards of Ridicule.--Painful Family Estrangements.--Enters Drury Lane.\r\n--Success of the Famous 'School for Scandal.'--Opinions of Sheridan and\r\nhis Influence.--The Literary Club.--Anecdote of Garrick's Admittance.--\r\nOrigin of the 'Rejected Addresses.'--New Flights.--Political Ambition.--\r\nThe Gaming Mania.--Almacks'.--Brookes'.--Black-balled.--Two Versions of\r\nthe Election Trick.--St. Stephen's Won.--Vocal Difficulties.--Leads a\r\nDouble Life.--Pitt's Vulgar Attack.--Sheridan's Happy Retort.--Grattan's\r\nQuip.--Sheridan's Sallies.--The Trial at Warren Hastings.--Wonderful\r\nEffect of Sheridan's Eloquence.--The Supreme Effort.--The Star\r\nCulminates.--Native Taste for Swindling.--A Shrewd but Graceless\r\nOxonian.--Duns Outwitted.--The Lawyer Jockeyed.--Adventures with\r\nBailiffs.--Sheridan's Powers of Persuasion.--House of Commons Greek.--\r\nCurious Mimicry.--The Royal Boon Company.--Street Frolics at Night.--An\r\nOld Tale.--'All's well that ends well.'--The Fray in St. Giles.'--\r\nUnopened Letters.--An Odd Incident.--Reckless Extravagance.--Sporting\r\nAmbition.--Like Father like Son.--A Severe and Witty Rebuke.--\r\nIntemperance.--Convivial Excesses of a Past Day.--Worth wins at last.--\r\nBitter Pangs.--The Scythe of Death.--Sheridan's Second Wife.--Debts of\r\nHonour.--Drury Lane Burnt.--The Owner's Serenity.--Misfortunes never come\r\nSingly.--The Whitbread Quarrel.--Ruined.--Undone and almost Forsaken.--\r\nThe Dead Man Arrested.--The Stories fixed on Sheridan.--Extempore Wit and\r\nInveterate Talkers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Sheridan! gambler, spendthrift, debtor, as thou wert, what is it\r\nthat shakes from our hand the stone we would fling at thee? Almost, we\r\nmust confess it, thy very faults; at least those qualities which seem to\r\nhave been thy glory and thy ruin: which brought thee into temptation; to\r\nwhich, hadst thou been less brilliant, less bountiful, thou hadst never\r\nbeen drawn. What is it that disarms us when we review thy life, and\r\nwrings from us a tear when we should utter a reproach? Thy punishment;\r\nthat bitter, miserable end; that long battling with poverty, debt,\r\ndisease, all brought on by thyself; that abandonment in the hour of\r\nneed, more bitter than them all; that awakening to the terrible truth of\r\nthe hollowness of man and rottenness of the world!--surely this is\r\nenough: surely we may hope that a pardon followed. But now let us view\r\nthee in thy upward flight the genius, the wit, the monarch of mind.\r\n\r\nThis great man, this wonderful genius, this eloquent senator, this most\r\napplauded dramatist was--hear it, oh, ye boys! and fling it triumphantly\r\nin the faces of your pedagogues--Sheridan, at your age, was a dunce!\r\nThis was the more extraordinary, inasmuch as his father, mother, and\r\ngrandfather were all celebrated for their quick mental powers. The last,\r\nin fact, Dr. Sheridan, was a successful and eminent schoolmaster, the\r\nintimate friend of Dean Swift, and an author. He was an Irish man and a\r\nwit, and would seem to have been a Jacobite to boot, for he was deprived\r\nof a chaplaincy he held under Government, for preaching, on King\r\nGeorge's birthday, a sermon having for its text 'Sufficient for the day\r\nis the evil thereof.'\r\n\r\nSheridan's mother, again--an eccentric, extraordinary woman--wrote\r\nnovels and plays; among the latter 'The Discovery,' which Garrick said\r\nwas 'one of the best comedies he ever read;' and Sheridan's father, Tom\r\nSheridan, was famous, in connection with the stage where he was so long\r\nthe rival of David Garrick.\r\n\r\nBorn of such parents, in September, 1751, Richard Brinsley Sheridan was\r\nsent in due course to Harrow, where that famous old pedant, Dr. Parr,\r\nwas at that time one of the masters. The Doctor has himself described\r\nthe lazy boy, in whose face he discovered the latent genius, and whom he\r\nattempted to inspire with a love of Greek verbs and Latin verses, by\r\nmaking him ashamed of his ignorance. But Richard preferred English\r\nverses and no verbs, and the Doctor failed. He did not, even at that\r\nperiod, cultivate elocution, of which his father was so good a master;\r\nthough Dr. Parr remembered one of his sisters, on a visit to Harrow,\r\nreciting, in accordance with her father's teaching, the well-known\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n  '_None_ but the brave,\r\n  None but the _brave_,\r\n  None _but_ the brave deserve the fair.\r\n\r\nBut the real mind of the boy who would not be a scholar showed itself\r\nearly enough. He had only just left Harrow, when he began to display his\r\nliterary abilities. He had formed at school the intimate acquaintance of\r\nHalhed, afterwards a distinguished Indianist, a man of like tastes with\r\nhimself; he had translated with him some of the poems of Theocritus. The\r\ntwo boys had revelled together in boyish dreams of literary fame--ah,\r\nthose boyish dreams! so often our noblest--so seldom realized. So often,\r\nalas! the aspirations to which we can look back as our purest and best,\r\nand which make us bitterly regret that they were but dreams. And now,\r\nwhen young Halhed went to Oxford, and young Sheridan to join his family\r\nat Bath, they continued these ambitious projects for a time, and laid\r\nout their fancy at full usury over many a work destined never to see the\r\nfingers of the printer's devil. Among these was a farce, or rather\r\nburlesque, which shows immense promise, and which, oddly enough,\r\nresembles in its cast the famous 'Critic,' which followed it later. It\r\nwas called 'Jupiter,' and turned chiefly on the story of Ixion--\r\n\r\n  'Embracing cloud, Ixion like,'\r\n\r\nthe lover of Juno, who caught a cold instead of the Queen of Heaven; and\r\nwho, according to the classical legend, tortured for ever on a wheel,\r\nwas in this production to be condemned for ever to trundle the machine\r\nof a 'needy knife-grinder,' amid a grand musical chorus of 'razors,\r\nscissors, and penknives to grind!' This piece was amusing enough, and\r\nclever enough, though it betrayed repeatedly the youthfulness of its\r\nauthors; but less so their next attempt, a weekly periodical, to be\r\ncalled 'Hernan's Miscellany,' of which Sheridan wrote, or was to write,\r\npretty nearly the whole. None but the first number was ever completed,\r\nand perhaps we need not regret that no more followed it; but it is\r\ntouching to see these two young men, both feeling their powers,\r\nconfident in them, and sunning their halcyon's wings in the happy belief\r\nthat they were those of the eagle, longing eagerly, earnestly, for the\r\nfew poor guineas that they hoped from their work. Halhed, indeed, wrote\r\ndiligently, but his colleague was not true to the contract, and though\r\nthe hope of gold stimulated him--for he was poor enough--from time to\r\ntime to a great effort, he was always 'beginning,' and never completing.\r\n\r\nThe only real product of these united labours was a volume of Epistles\r\nin verse from the Greek of a poor writer of late age, Aristaenetus. This\r\nvolume, which does little credit to either of its parents, was\r\npositively printed and published in 1770, but the rich harvest of fame\r\nand shillings which they expected from it was never gathered in. Yet the\r\nbook excited some little notice. The incognito of its authors induced\r\nsome critics to palm it even on such a man as Dr. Johnson; others\r\npraised; others sneered at it. In the young men it raised hopes, only to\r\ndash them; but its failure was not so utter as to put the idea of\r\nliterary success entirely out of their heads, nor its success sufficient\r\nto induce them to rush recklessly into print, and thus strangle their\r\nfame in its cradle. Let it fail, was Richard Sheridan's thought; he had\r\nnow a far more engrossing ambition. In a word, he was in love.\r\n\r\nYes, he was in love for a time--only for a time, and not truly. But, be\r\nit remembered, Sheridan's evil days had not commenced. He sowed his wild\r\noats late in life,--alack for him!--and he never finished sowing them.\r\nHis was not the viciousness of nature, but the corruption of success.\r\n'In all time of wealth, good Lord deliver us!' What prayer can wild,\r\nunrestrained, unheeding Genius utter with more fervency? I own Genius is\r\nrarely in love. There is an egotism, almost a selfishness, about it,\r\nthat will not stoop to such common worship. Women know it, and often\r\nprefer the blunt, honest, common-place soldier to the wild erratic poet.\r\nGenius, grand as it is, is unsympathetic. It demands higher--the highest\r\njoys. Genius claims to be loved, but to love is too much to ask it. And\r\nyet at this time Sheridan was not a matured Genius. When his development\r\ncame, he cast off this very love for which he had fought, manoeuvred,\r\nstruggled, and was unfaithful to the very wife whom he had nearly died\r\nto obtain.\r\n\r\nMiss Linley was one of a family who have been called 'a nest of\r\nnightingales.' Young ladies who practise elaborate pieces and sing\r\nsimple ballads in the voice of a white mouse, know the name of Linley\r\nwell. For ages the Linleys have been the bards of England--composers,\r\nmusicians, singers, always popular, always English. Sheridan's love was\r\none of the most renowned of the family, but the 'Maid of Bath,' as she\r\nwas called, was as celebrated for her beauty as for the magnificence of\r\nher voice. When Sheridan first knew her, she was only sixteen years\r\nold--very beautiful, clever, and modest. She was a singer by profession,\r\nliving at Bath, as Sheridan, only three years older than herself, also\r\nwas, but attending concerts, oratorios, and so forth, in other places,\r\nespecially at Oxford. Her adorers were legion; and the Oxford boys\r\nespecially--always in love as they are--were among them. Halhed was\r\namong these last, and in the innocence of his heart confided his passion\r\nto his friend Dick Sheridan. At sixteen the young beauty began her\r\nconquests. A rich old Wiltshire squire, with a fine heart, as golden as\r\nhis guineas, offered to or for her, and was readily accepted. But\r\n'Cecilia,' as she was always called, could not sacrifice herself on the\r\naltar of duty, and she privately told him that though she honoured and\r\nesteemed, she could never love him. The old gentleman proved his worth.\r\nDid he storm? did he hold her to her engagement? did he shackle himself\r\nwith a young wife, who would only learn to hate him for his persinacity?\r\nNot a bit of it. He acted with a generosity which should be held up as a\r\nmodel to all old gentlemen who are wild enough, to fall in love with\r\ngirls of sixteen. He knew Mr. Linley, who was delighted with the match,\r\nwould be furious if it were broken off. He offered to take on himself\r\nall the blame if the breach, and, to satisfy the angry parent, settled\r\n£1,000 on the daughter. The offer was accepted, and the trial for breach\r\nof promise with which the père Linley had threatened Mr. Long, was of\r\ncourse withheld. Mr. Long afterwards presented Mrs. Sheridan with\r\n£3,000.\r\n\r\nThe 'Maid of Bath' was now an heiress as well as a fascinating beauty,\r\nbut her face and her voice were the chief enchantments with her ardent\r\nand youthful adorers. The Sheridans had settled in Mead Street, in that\r\ntown which is celebrated for its gambling, its scandal, and its\r\nunhealthy situation at the bottom of a natural basin. Well might the\r\nRomans build their baths there: it will take more water than even Bath\r\nsupplies to wash out its follies and iniquities. It certainly is strange\r\nhow washing and cards go together. One would fancy there were no baths\r\nin Eden, for wherever there are baths, there we find idleness and all\r\nits attendant vices.\r\n\r\nThe Linleys were soon intimate with the Sheridans, and the Maid of Bath\r\nadded to her adorers both Richard and his elder brother Charles; only,\r\njust as at Harrow every one thought Richard a dunce and he disappointed\r\nthem; so at Bath no one thought Richard would fall in love, and he _did_\r\ndisappoint them--none more so than Charles, his brother, and Halhed, his\r\nbosom friend. As for the latter, he was almost mad in his devotion, and\r\ncertainly extravagant in his expressions. He described his passion by a\r\nclever, but rather disagreeable simile, which Sheridan, who was a most\r\ndisgraceful plagiarist, though he had no need to be so, afterwards\r\nadopted as his own. 'Just as the Egyptian pharmacists,' wrote Halhed, in\r\na Latin letter, in which he described the power of Miss Linley's voice\r\nover his spirit, 'were wont, in embalming a dead body to draw the brain\r\nout through the ears with a crooked hook, this nightingale has drawn out\r\nthrough mine ears not my brain only, but my heart also.'\r\n\r\nThen among other of her devotees were Norris, the singer, and Mr. Watts,\r\na rich gentleman-commoner, who had also met her at Oxford. Surely with\r\nsuch and other rivals, the chances of the quiet, unpretending,\r\nundemonstrative boy of nineteen were small. But no, Miss Linley was\r\nfoolish enough to be captivated by genius, and charmed by such poems as\r\nthe quiet boy wrote to her, of which this is, perhaps, one of the\r\nprettiest:\r\n\r\n  'Dry that tear, my gentlest love;\r\n    Be hush'd that struggling sigh,\r\n  Nor seasons, day, nor fate shall prove\r\n    More fix'd, more true than I.\r\n  Hush'd be that sigh, be dry that tear;\r\n  Cease boding doubt, cease anxious fear:\r\n    Dry be that tear.\r\n\r\n  'Ask'st thou how long my love will stay,\r\n    When all that's new is past?\r\n  How long, ah Delia, can I say\r\n    How long my life will last?\r\n  Dry be that tear, be hush'd that sigh,\r\n  At least I'll love thee till I die:\r\n    Hush'd be that sigh.\r\n\r\n  'And does that thought affect thee too,\r\n    The thought of Sylvio's death,\r\n  That he who only breath'd for you,\r\n    Must yield that faithful breath?\r\n  Hush'd be that sigh, be dry that tear,\r\n  Nor let us lose our Heaven here:\r\n    Be dry that tear.'\r\n\r\nThe many adorers had not the remotest suspicion of this devotion, and\r\n'gave her' to this, that, or the other eligible personage; but the\r\nvillanous conduct of a scoundrel soon brought the matter to a crisis.\r\nThe whole story was as romantic as it could be. In a three-volume novel,\r\ncritics, always so just and acute in their judgment, would call it\r\nfar-fetched, improbable, unnatural; in short, anything but what should\r\nbe the plot of the pure 'domestic English story.' Yet, here it is with\r\nalmost dramatic effect, the simple tale of what really befel one of our\r\nmost celebrated men.\r\n\r\nYes, to complete the fiction-like aspect of the affair, there was even a\r\n'captain' in the matter--as good a villain as ever shone in short hose\r\nand cut doublet at the 'Strand' or 'Victoria.' Captain Matthews was a\r\nmarried man, and a very naughty one. He was an intimate friend of the\r\nLinleys, and wanted to push his intimacy too far. In short, 'not to put\r\ntoo fine a point on it' (too fine a point is precisely what never _is_\r\nput), he attempted to seduce the pretty, innocent girl, and not dismayed\r\nat one failure, went on again and again. 'Cecilia,' knowing the temper\r\nof Linley père, was afraid to expose him to her father, and with a\r\ncourse, which we of the present day cannot but think strange, if nothing\r\nmore, disclosed the attempts of her persecutor to no other than her own\r\nlover, Richard Brinsley Sheridan.\r\n\r\nStrange want of delicacy, undoubtedly, and yet we can excuse the poor\r\nsongstress, with a father who sought only to make money out of her\r\ntalents, and no other relations to confide in. But Richard Brinsley,\r\nlong her lover, now resolved to be both her protector and her husband.\r\nHe persuaded her to fly to France, under cover of entering a convent. He\r\ninduced his sister to lend him money out of that provided for the\r\nhousekeeping at home, hired a post-chaise, and sent a sedan-chair to her\r\nfather's house in the Crescent to convey her to it, and wafted her off\r\nto town. Thence, after a few adroit lies on the part of Sheridan, they\r\nsailed to Dunkirk; and there he persuaded her to become his wife. She\r\nconsented, and they were knotted together by an obliging priest\r\naccustomed to these runaway matches from _la perfide Albion_.\r\n\r\nThe irate parent, Linley, followed, recaptured his daughter, and brought\r\nHer back to England. Meanwhile, the elopement excited great agitation in\r\nthe good city of Bath, and among others, the villain of the story, the\r\ngallant Captain Matthews, posted Richard Brinsley as 'a scoundrel and a\r\nliar,' the then polite method of expressing disgust. Home came Richard\r\nin the wake of Miss Linley, who rejoiced in the unromantic praenomen of\r\n'Betsy,' to her angry parent, and found matters had been running high in\r\nhis short absence. A duel with Matthews seems to have been the natural\r\nconsequence, and up Richard posted to London to fight it. Matthews\r\nplayed the craven--Sheridan the impetuous lover. They met, fought,\r\nseized one another's swords, wrestled, fell together, and wounded each\r\nother with the stumps of their rapiers in true Chevy-Chase fashion.\r\nMatthews, who had behaved in a cowardly manner in the first affair,\r\nsought to retrieve his honour by sending a second challenge. Again the\r\nrivals--well represented in 'The Rivals' afterwards produced--met at\r\nKingsdown. Mr. Matthews drew; Mr. Sheridan advanced on him at first: Mr.\r\nMatthews in turn advanced fast on Mr. Sheridan; upon which he retreated,\r\ntill he very suddenly ran in upon Mr. Matthews, laying himself\r\nexceedingly open, and endeavouring to get hold of Mr. Matthews' sword.\r\nMr. Matthews received him at point, and, I believe, disengaged his sword\r\nfrom Mr. Sheridan's body, and gave him another wound. The same scene was\r\nnow enacted, and a _combat à l'outrance_ took place, ending in mutual\r\nwounds, and fortunately no one dead.\r\n\r\nPoor little Betsy was at Oxford when all this took place. On her return\r\nto Bath she heard something of it, and unconsciously revealed the secret\r\nof her private marriage, claiming the right of a wife to watch over her\r\nwounded husband. Then came the _dénouement_. Old Tom Sheridan rejected\r\nhis son. The angry Linley would have rejected his daughter, but for her\r\nhonour. Richard was sent off into Essex, and in due time the couple were\r\nlegally married in England. So ended a wild, romantic affair, in which\r\nSheridan took a desperate, but not altogether honourable, part. But the\r\ndramatist got more out of it than a pretty wife. Like all true geniuses,\r\nhe employed his own experience in the production of his works, and drew\r\nfrom the very event of his life some hints or touches to enliven the\r\ncharacters of his imagination. Surely the bravado and cowardice of\r\nCaptain Matthews, who on the first meeting in the Park is described as\r\nfinding all kinds of difficulties in the way of their fighting,\r\nobjecting now to the ground as unlevel, now to the presence of a\r\nstranger, who turns out to be an officer, and very politely moves off\r\nwhen requested, who, in short, delays the event as long as possible,\r\nmust have supplied the idea of Bob Acres; while the very conversations,\r\nof which we have no record, may have given him some of those hints of\r\ncharacter which made the 'Rivals' so successful. That play--his\r\nfirst--was written in 1774. It failed on its first appearance, owing to\r\nthe bad acting of the part of Sir Lucius O'Trigger, by Mr. Lee; but when\r\nanother actor was substituted, the piece was at once successful, and\r\nacted with overflowing houses all over the country. How could it be\r\notherwise? It may have been exaggerated, far-fetched, unnatural, but\r\nsuch characters as Sir Anthony Absolute, Sir Lucius, Bob Acres, Lydia\r\nLanguish, and most of all Mrs. Malaprop, so admirably conceived, and so\r\ncarefully and ingeniously worked out, could not but be admired. They\r\nhave become household words; they are even now our standards of\r\nridicule, and be they natural or not, these last eighty years have\r\nchanged the world so little that Malaprops and Acreses may be found in\r\nthe range of almost any man's experience, and in every class of society.\r\n\r\nSheridan and his divine Betsy were now living in their own house, in\r\nthat Dull little place, Orchard Street, Portman Square, then an\r\naristocratic neighbourhood, and he was diligent in the production of\r\nessays, pamphlets, and farces, many of which never saw the light, while\r\nothers fell flat, or were not calculated to bring him any fame. What\r\ngreat authors have not experienced the same disappointments? What men\r\nwould ever be great if they allowed such checks to damp their energy, or\r\nwere turned back by them from the course in which they feel that their\r\npower lies?\r\n\r\nBut his next work, the opera of 'The Duenna,' had a yet more signal\r\nsuccess, and a run of no less than seventy-five nights at Covent Garden,\r\nwhich put Garrick at Drury Lane to his wit's end to know how to compete\r\nwith it. Old Linley himself composed the music for it; and to show how\r\nthus a family could hold the stage, Garrick actually played off the\r\nmother against the son, and revived Mrs. Sheridan's comedy of 'The\r\nDiscovery,' to compete with Richard Sheridan's 'Duenna.'\r\n\r\nThe first night 'The Rivals' was brought out at Bath came Sheridan's\r\nfather, who, as we have seen, had refused to have anything to say to his\r\nson. It is related as an instance of Richard's filial affection, that\r\nduring the representation he placed himself behind a side-scene opposite\r\nto the box in which his father and sisters sat, and gazed at them all\r\nthe time. When he returned to his house and wife, he burst into tears,\r\nand declared that he felt it too bitter that he alone should have been\r\nforbidden to speak to those on whom he had been gazing all the night.\r\n\r\nDuring the following year this speculative man, who married on nothing\r\nbut his brain, and had no capital, no wealthy friends, in short nothing\r\nwhatever, suddenly appears in the most mysterious manner as a\r\ncapitalist, and lays down his £10,000 in the coolest and quietest\r\nmanner. And for what? For a share in the purchase of Garrick's moiety of\r\nthe patent of Drury Lane. The whole property was worth £70,000; Garrick\r\nsold his half for £35,000, of which old Mr. Linley contributed £10,000,\r\nDr. Ford £15,000, and penniless Sheridan the balance. Where he got the\r\nmoney nobody knew, and apparently nobody asked. It was paid, and he\r\nentered at once on the business of proprietor of that old house, where\r\nso many a Roscius has strutted and declaimed with more or less fame; so\r\nmany a Walking gentleman done his five shillings' worth of polite\r\ncomedy, so many a tinsel king degraded the 'legitimate drama,' in the\r\nmost illegitimate manner, and whose glories were extinguished with the\r\nreign of Macready, when we were boys, _nous autres_.\r\n\r\nThe first piece he contributed to this stage was 'A Trip to\r\nScarborough,' Which was only a species of 'family edition of Vanbrugh's\r\nplay, 'The Relapse;' but in 1777 he reached the acme of his fame, in\r\n'The School for Scandal.'\r\n\r\nBut alack and alas for these sensual days, when it is too much trouble\r\nto think, and people go to the play, if they go at all, to feast their\r\neyes and ears, not their minds; can any sensible person believe that if\r\n'The School for Scandal,' teeming as it does with wit, satire, and\r\ncharacter, finer and truer than in any play produced since the days of\r\nBen Jonson, Massinger, and Marlowe, were set on the boards of the\r\nHaymarket at this day, as a new piece by an author of no very high\r\ncelebrity, it would draw away a single admirer from the flummery in\r\nOxford Street, the squeaking at Covent Garden, or the broad, exaggerated\r\nfarce at the Adelphi or Olympic? No: it may still have its place on the\r\nLondon stage when well acted, but it owes that to its ancient celebrity,\r\nand it can never compete with the tinsel and tailoring which alone can\r\nmake even Shakspeare go down with a modern audience.\r\n\r\nIn those days of Garrick, on the other hand, those glorious days of true\r\nhistrionic art, high and low were not ashamed to throng Drury Lane and\r\nCovent Garden, and make the appearance of a new play the great event of\r\nthe season. Hundreds were turned away from the doors, when 'The School\r\nfor Scandal' was acted, and those who were fortunate enough to get in\r\nmade the piece the subject of conversation in society for many a night,\r\npassing keen comment on every scene, every line, every word almost, and\r\nusing their minds as we now use our eyes.\r\n\r\nThis brilliant play, the earliest idea of which was derived from its\r\nauthor's experience of the gossip of that kettle of scandal and\r\nbackbiting, Bath, where, if no other commandment were ever broken, the\r\nconstant breach of the ninth would suffice to put it on a level with\r\ncertain condemned cities we have somewhere read of, won for Sheridan a\r\nreputation of which he at once felt the value, and made his purchase of\r\na share in the property of Old Drury for the time being, a successful\r\nspeculation. It produced a result which his good heart perhaps valued\r\neven more than the guineas which now flowed in; it induced his father,\r\nwho had long been at war with him, to seek a reconciliation, and the\r\nelder Sheridan actually became manager of the theatre of which his son\r\nwas part proprietor.\r\n\r\nOld Tom Sheridan had always been a proud man, and when once he was\r\noffended, was hard to bring round again. His quarrel with Johnson was an\r\ninstance of this. In 1762 the Doctor, hearing they had given Sheridan a\r\npension of two hundred a year, exclaimed, 'What have they given _him_ a\r\npension? then it is time for me to give up mine.' A 'kind friend' took\r\ncare to repeat the peevish exclamation, without adding what Johnson had\r\nsaid immediately afterwards, 'However, I am glad that they have given\r\nMr. Sheridan a pension, for he is a very good man.' The actor was\r\ndisgusted; and though Boswell interfered, declined to be reconciled. On\r\none occasion he even rushed from a house at which he was to dine, when\r\nhe heard that the great Samuel had been invited. The Doctor had little\r\nopinion of Sheridan's declamation. 'Besides, sir,' said he, 'what\r\ninfluence can Mr. Sheridan have upon the language of this great country\r\nby his narrow exertions. Sir, it is burning a farthing candle at Dover\r\nto show light at Calais.' Still, when Garrick attacked his rival,\r\nJohnson nobly defended him. 'No sir,' he said, 'there is to be sure, in\r\nSheridan, something to reprehend, and everything to laugh at; but, sir,\r\nhe is not a bad man. No, sir, were mankind to be divided into good and\r\nbad, he would stand considerably within the ranks of the good.'\r\n\r\nHowever, the greatest bully of his age (and the kindest-hearted man)\r\nthought very differently of the son. Richard Brinsley had written a\r\nprologue to Savage's play of 'Sir Thomas Overbury'--\r\n\r\n  'Ill-fated Savage, at whose birth was giv'n\r\n  No parent but the Muse, no friend but Heav'n;'\r\n\r\nand in this had paid an elegant compliment to the great lexicographer,\r\nwinding up with these lines:--\r\n\r\n  'So pleads the tale that gives to future times\r\n  The son's misfortunes and the parent's crimes;\r\n  There shall his fame, if own'd to-night, survive,\r\n  Fix'd _by the hand that bids our language live_--\r\n\r\nreferring at once to Johnson's life of his friend Savage and to his\r\ngreat Dictionary. It was Savage, every one remembers, with whom Johnson\r\nin his days of starvation was wont to walk the streets all night,\r\nneither of them being able to pay for a lodging, and with whom, walking\r\none night round and round St. James's Square, he kept up his own and his\r\ncompanion's spirits by inveighing against the minister and declaring\r\nthat they would 'stand by their country.'\r\n\r\nDoubtless the Doctor felt as much pleasure at the meed awarded to his\r\nold companion in misery as at the high compliment to himself. Anyhow he\r\npronounced that Sheridan 'had written the two best comedies of his age,'\r\nand therefore proposed him as a member of the Literary Club.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated gathering of wit and whimsicality, founded by Johnson\r\nhimself in conjunction with Sir J. Reynolds, was the Helicon of London\r\nLetters, and the temple which the greatest talker of his age had built\r\nfor himself, and in which he took care to be duly worshipped. It met at\r\nthe Turk's Head in Gerrard Street, Soho, every Friday; and from seven in\r\nthe evening to almost any hour of night was the scene of such talk,\r\nmainly on literature and learning, as has never been heard since in this\r\ncountry. It consisted at this period of twenty-six members, and there is\r\nscarcely one among them whose name is not known to-day as well as any in\r\nthe history of our literature. Besides the high priests, Reynolds and\r\nJohnson, there came Edmund Burke, Fox, Sheridan, and many another of\r\nless note, to represent the senate: Goldsmith, Gibbon, Adam Smith,\r\nMalone, Dr. Burney, Percy, Nugent, Sir William Jones, three Irish\r\nbishops, and a host of others, crowded in from the ranks of learning and\r\nliterature. Garrick and George Colman found here an indulgent audience;\r\nand the light portion of the company comprised such men as Topham\r\nBeauclerk, Bennet Langton, Vesey, and a dozen of lords and baronets. In\r\nshort, they were picked men, and if their conversation was not always\r\nwitty, it was because they had all wit and frightened one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FAMOUS LITERARY CLUB.]\r\n\r\nAmong them the bullying Doctor rolled in majestic grumpiness; scolded,\r\ndogmatized, contradicted, pished and pshawed; and made himself generally\r\ndisagreeable; yet, hail the omen, Intellect! such was the force, such\r\nthe fame of his mind, that the more he snorted, the more they adored\r\nhim--the more he bullied, the more humbly they knocked under. He was\r\nquite 'His Majesty' at the Turk's Head, and the courtiers waited for his\r\ncoming with anxiety, and talked of him till he came in the same manner\r\nas the lacqueys in the anteroom of a crowned monarch. Boswell, who, by\r\nthe way, was also a member--of course he was, or how should we have had\r\nthe great man's conversations handed down to us?--was sure to keep them\r\nup to the proper mark of adulation if they ever flagged in it, and was\r\nas servile in his admiration in the Doctor's absence as when he was there\r\nto call him a fool for his pains.\r\n\r\nThus, on one occasion while 'King Johnson' tarried, the courtiers were\r\ndiscussing his journey to the Hebrides and his coming away 'willing to\r\nbelieve the second sight.' Some of them smiled at this, but Bozzy was\r\ndown on them with more than usual servility. 'He is only _willing_ to\r\nbelieve,' he exclaimed. '_I do_ believe. The evidence is enough for me,\r\nthough not for his great mind. What will not fill a quart bottle will\r\nfill a pint bottle. I am filled with belief.'--'Are you?' said Colman,\r\nslily; 'then cork it up.'\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of Johnson's pride in his own club, which always remained\r\nextremely exclusive, we have what he said of Garrick, who, before he was\r\nelected, carelessly told Reynolds he liked the club, and thought 'he\r\nwould be of them.'\r\n\r\n'_He'll be of us!_' roared the Doctor indignantly, on hearing of this.\r\n'How does he know we will _permit_ him? The first duke in England has no\r\nright to hold such language!'\r\n\r\nIt can easily be imagined that when 'His Majesty' expressed his approval\r\nof Richard Brinsley, then a young man of eight-and-twenty, there was no\r\none who ventured to blackball him, and so Sheridan was duly elected.\r\n\r\nThe fame of 'The School for Scandal' was a substantial one for Richard\r\nBrinsley, and in the following year he extended his speculation by\r\nbuying the other moiety of Drury Lane. This theatre, which took its name\r\nfrom the old Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane, where Killigrew acted in the\r\ndays of Charles II. is famous for the number of times it has been\r\nrebuilt. The first house had been destroyed in 1674; and the one in\r\nwhich Garrick acted was built by Sir Christopher Wren and opened with a\r\nprologue by Dryden. In 1793 this was rebuilt. In 1809 it was burnt to\r\nthe ground; and on its re-opening the Committee advertised a prize for a\r\nprologue, which was supposed to be tried for by all the poets and\r\npoetasters then in England.[7] Sheridan adding afterwards a condition\r\nthat he wanted an address without a Phoenix in it. Horace Smith and his\r\nbrother seized the opportunity to parody the style of the most\r\ncelebrated in their delightful 'Rejected Addresses.' Drury Lane has\r\nalways been grand in its prologue, for besides Dryden and Byron, it\r\ncould boast of Sam. Johnson, who wrote the address when Garrick opened\r\nthe theatre in 1747. No theatre ever had more great names connected with\r\nits history.\r\n\r\n[7: None of the addresses sent in having given satisfaction, Lord Byron\r\nwas requested to write one, which he did.]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1778, after the purchase of the other moiety of this property,\r\nthat Sheridan set on its boards 'The Critic.' Though this was denounced\r\nas itself as complete a plagiarism as any Sir Fretful Plagiary could\r\nmake, and though undoubtedly the idea of it was borrowed, its wit, so\r\ntruly Sheridanian, and its complete characters, enhanced its author's\r\nfame, in spite of the disappointment of those who expected higher things\r\nfrom the writer of 'The School for Scandal.' Whether Sheridan would have\r\ngone on improving, had he remained true to the drama, 'The Critic'\r\nleaves us in doubt. But he was a man of higher ambition. Step by step,\r\nunexpectedly, and apparently unprepared, he had taken by storm the\r\nout-works of the citadel he was determined to capture, and he seems to\r\nhave cared little to garrison these minor fortresses. He had carried off\r\nfrom among a dozen suitors a wife of such beauty that Walpole thus\r\nwrites of her in 1773:--\r\n\r\n'I was at the ball last night, and have only been at the opera, where I\r\nwas infinitely struck with the Carrara, who is the prettiest creature\r\nupon earth. Mrs. Hartley I find still handsomer, and Miss Linley is to\r\nbe the superlative degree. The king admires the last, and ogles her as\r\nmuch as he dares in so holy a place as an oratorio, and at so devout a\r\nservice as Alexander's Feast'\r\n\r\nYet Sheridan did not prize his lovely wife as he should have done, when\r\nhe had once obtained her. Again he had struck boldly into the drama, and\r\nin four years had achieved that fame as a play-writer to which even\r\nJohnson could testify so handsomely. He now quitted this, and with the\r\nsame innate power--the same consciousness of success--the same readiness\r\nof genius--took a higher, far more brilliant flight than ever. Yet had\r\nhe garrisoned the forts he captured, he would have been a better,\r\nhappier, and more prosperous man. Had he been true to the Maid of Bath,\r\nhis character would not have degenerated as it did. Had he kept up his\r\nconnection with the drama, he would not have lost so largely by his\r\nspeculation in Drury Lane. His genius became his temptation, and he\r\nhurried on to triumph and to fall.\r\n\r\nPublic praise is a syren which the young sailor through life cannot\r\nresist. Political life is a fine aim, even when its seeker starts\r\nwithout a shred of real patriotism to conceal his personal ambition. No\r\nyoung man of any character can think, without a thrill of rapture, on\r\nthe glory of having _his_ name--now obscure--written in capitals on the\r\npage of his country's history. A true patriot cares nothing for fame; a\r\nreally great man is content to die nameless, if his acts may but survive\r\nhim. Sheridan was not really great, and it may be doubted if he had any\r\nsincerity in his political views. But the period favoured the rise of\r\nyoung men of genius. In former reigns a man could have little hope of\r\npolitical influence without being first a courtier; but by this time\r\nliberalism had made giant strides. The leaven of revolutionary ideas,\r\nwhich had leavened the whole lump in France, was still working quietly\r\nand less passionately in this country, and being less repressed,\r\ndisplayed itself in the last quarter of the eighteenth century in the\r\nform of a strong and brilliant opposition. It was to this that the young\r\nmen of ambition attached themselves, rallying under the standard of\r\nCharles James Fox, since it was there only that their talents were\r\nsufficient to recommend them.\r\n\r\nTo this party, Sheridan, laughing in his sleeve at the extravagance of\r\ntheir demands--so that when they clamoured for a 'parliament once a\r\nyear, or oftener if need be,' he pronounced himself an\r\n'Oftener-if-need-be' man--was introduced, when his fame as a literary\r\nman had brought him into contact with some of its hangers on. Fox, after\r\nhis first interview with him, affirmed that he had always thought Hare\r\nand Charles Townsend the wittiest men he had ever met, but that Sheridan\r\nsurpassed them both; and Sheridan was equally pleased with 'the Man of\r\nthe People.'\r\n\r\nThe first step to this political position was to become a member of a\r\ncertain club, where its leaders gambled away their money, and drank away\r\ntheir minds--to wit, Brookes'. Pretty boys, indeed, were these great\r\nWhig patriots when turned loose in these precincts. The tables were for\r\nstakes of twenty or fifty guineas, but soon ran up to hundreds. What did\r\nit matter to Charles James Fox, to the Man of the People, whether he\r\nlost five, seven, or ten thousand of a night, when the one-half came out\r\nof his father's, the other out of Hebrew, pockets--the sleek,\r\nthick-lipped owners of which thronged his Jerusalem chamber, as he\r\ncalled his back sitting-room, only too glad to 'oblige' him to any\r\namount? The rage for gaming at this pandemonium may be understood from a\r\nrule of the club, which it was found necessary to make to interdict it\r\n_in the eating-room_, but to which was added the truly British\r\nexception, which allowed two members of Parliament in those days, or two\r\n'gentlemen' of any kind, to toss up for what they had ordered.\r\n\r\nThis charming resort of the dissipated was originally established in\r\nPall Mall in 1764, and the manager was that same Almack who afterwards\r\nopened a lady's club in the rooms now called Willis's, in King Street,\r\nSt. James's; who also owned the famous Thatched House, and whom Gilly\r\nWilliams described as having a 'Scotch face, in a bag-wig,' waiting on\r\nthe ladies at supper. In 1778 Brookes--a wine-merchant and money-lender,\r\nwhom Tickell, in his famous 'Epistle from the Hon. Charles Fox,\r\npartridge-shooting, to the Hon. John Townsend, cruising,' describes in\r\nthese lines;--\r\n\r\n  'And know I've bought the best champagne from Brookes,\r\n  From liberal Brookes, whose speculative skill\r\n  Is hasty credit, and a distant bill:\r\n  Who, nurs'd in clubs, disdains a vulgar trade:\r\n  Exults to trust, and blushes to be paid--'\r\n\r\nbuilt and opened the present club-house in St. James's Street, and\r\nthither the members of Almack's migrated. Brookes' speculative skill,\r\nhowever, did not make him a rich man, and the 'gentlemen' he dealt with\r\nwere perhaps too gentlemanly to pay him. He died poor in 1782. Almack's\r\nat first consisted of twenty-seven members, one of whom was C.J. Fox.\r\nGibbon, the historian, was actually a member of it, and says that in\r\nspite of the rage for play, he found the society there rational and\r\nentertaining. Sir Joshua Reynolds wanted to be a member of it too. 'You\r\nsee,' says Topham Beauclerk thereupon, 'what noble ambition will make a\r\nman attempt. That den is not yet opened,' &c.\r\n\r\nBrookes', however, was far more celebrated, and besides Fox, Reynolds,\r\nand Gibbon, there were here to be found Horace Walpole, David Hume,\r\nBurke, Selwyn, and Garrick. It would be curious to discover how much\r\nreligion, how much morality, and how much vanity there were among the\r\nset. The first two would require a microscope to examine, the last an\r\nocean to contain it. But let Tickell describe its inmates:--\r\n\r\n  'Soon as to Brookes's thence thy footsteps bend\r\n  What gratulations thy approach attend!\r\n  See Gibbon rap his box--auspicious sign,\r\n  That classic compliment and wit combine;\r\n  See Beauclerk's cheek a tinge of red surprise,\r\n  And friendship give what cruel health denies;\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Of wit, of taste, of fancy we'll debate,\r\n  If Sheridan for once be not too late.\r\n  But scarce a thought on politics we'll spare\r\n  Unless on Polish politics with Hare.\r\n  Good-natured Devon! oft shall there appear\r\n  The cool complacence of thy friendly sneer;\r\n  Oft shall Fitzpatrick's wit, and Stanhope's ease,\r\n  And Burgoyne's manly sense combine to please.\r\n\r\nTo show how high gaming ran in this assembly of wits, even so early at\r\n1772, there is a memorandum in the books, stating that Mr. Thynne\r\nretired from the club in disgust, because he had only won £12,000 in two\r\nmonths. The principal games at this period were quinze and faro.\r\n\r\nInto this eligible club Richard Sheridan, who ten years before had been\r\nagreeing with Halhed on the bliss of making a couple of hundred pounds\r\nby their literary exertions, now essayed to enter as a member; but in\r\nvain. One black-ball sufficed to nullify his election, and that one was\r\ndropped in by George Selwyn, who, with degrading littleness, would not\r\nhave the son of an actor among them. Again and again he made the\r\nattempt; again and again Selwyn foiled him; and it was not till 1780\r\nthat he succeeded. The Prince of Wales was then his devoted friend, and\r\nwas determined he should be admitted into the club. The elections at\r\nthat time took place between eleven at night and one o'clock in the\r\nmorning, and the 'greatest gentleman in Europe' took care to be in the\r\nhall when the ballot began. Selwyn came down as usual, bent on triumph.\r\nThe prince called him to him. There was nothing for it; Selwyn was\r\nforced to obey. The prince walked him up and down the hall, engaging him\r\nin an apparently most important conversation. George Selwyn answered him\r\nquestion after question, and made desperate attempts to slip away. The\r\nother George had always something more to say to him. The long finger of\r\nthe clock went round, and Selwyn's long white fingers were itching for\r\nthe black ball. The prince was only more and more interested, the wit\r\nonly more and more abstracted. Never was the young George more lively,\r\nor the other more silent. But it was all in vain. The finger of the\r\nclock went round and round, and at last the members came out noisily\r\nfrom the balloting-room, and the smiling faces of the prince's friends\r\nshowed to the unhappy Selwyn that his enemy had been elected.\r\n\r\nSo, at least, runs one story. The other, told by Sir Nathaniel Wraxall,\r\nis perhaps more probable. It appears that the Earl of Besborough was no\r\nless opposed to his election than George Selwyn, and these two\r\nindividuals agreed at any cost of comfort to be always at the club at\r\nthe time of the ballot to throw in their black balls. On the night of\r\nhis success, Lord Besborough was there as usual, and Selwyn was at his\r\nrooms in Cleveland Row, preparing to come to the club. Suddenly a\r\nchairman rushed into Brookes' with an important note for my lord, who,\r\non tearing it open, found to his horror that it was from his\r\ndaughter-in-law, Lady Duncannon, announcing that his house in Cavendish\r\nSquare was on fire, and imploring him to come immediately. Feeling\r\nconfident that his fellow conspirator would be true to his post, the\r\nearl set off at once. But almost the same moment Selwyn received a\r\nmessage informing him that his adopted daughter, of whom he was very\r\nfond, was seized with an alarming illness. The ground was cleared; and\r\nby the time the earl returned, having, it is needless to say, found his\r\nhouse in a perfect state of security, and was joined by Selwyn, whose\r\ndaughter had never been better in her life, the actor's son was elected,\r\nand the conspirators found they had been duped.\r\n\r\nBut it is far easier in this country to get into that House, where one\r\nhas to represent the interests of thousands, and take a share in the\r\ngovernment of a nation, than to be admitted to a club where one has but\r\nto lounge, to gamble, and to eat dinner; and Sheridan was elected for\r\nthe town of Stafford with probably little more artifice than the old and\r\nstale one of putting five-pound notes under voters' glasses, or paying\r\nthirty pounds for a home-cured ham. Whether he bribed or not, a petition\r\nwas presented against his election, almost as a matter of course in\r\nthose days, and his maiden speech was made in defence of the good\r\nburgesses of that quiet little county-town. After making this speech,\r\nwhich was listened to in silence on account of his reputation as a\r\ndramatic author, but which does not appear to have been very wonderful,\r\nhe rushed up to the gallery, and eagerly asked his friend Woodfall what\r\nhe thought of it. That candid man shook his head, and told him oratory\r\nwas not his forte, Sheridan leaned his head on his hand a moment, and\r\nthen exclaimed with vehement emphasis, 'It is in me, however, and, by\r\nHeaven! it shall come out.'\r\n\r\nHe spoke prophetically, yet not as the great man who determines to\r\nconquer difficulties, but rather as one who feels conscious of his own\r\npowers, and knows that they must show themselves sooner or later.\r\nSheridan found himself labouring under the same natural obstacles as\r\nDemosthenes--though in a less degree--a thick and disagreeable tone of\r\nvoice; but we do not find in the indolent but gifted Englishman that\r\nadmirable perseverance, that conquering zeal, which enabled the Athenian\r\nto turn these very impediments to his own advantage. He did, indeed,\r\nprepare his speeches, and at times had fits of that same diligence which\r\nhe had displayed in the preparation of 'The School for Scandal;' but his\r\nindolent, self-indulgent mode of life left him no time for such steady\r\ndevotion to oratory as might have made him the finest speaker of his\r\nage, for perhaps his natural abilities were greater than those of Pitt,\r\nFox, or even Burke, though his education was inferior to that of those\r\ntwo statesmen.\r\n\r\nFrom this time Sheridan's life had two phases--that of a politician, and\r\nthat of a man of the world. With the former, we have nothing to do in\r\nsuch a memoir as this, and indeed it is difficult to say whether it was\r\nin oratory, the drama, or wit that he gained the greatest celebrity.\r\nThere is, however, some difference between the three capacities. On the\r\nmimic stage, and on the stage of the country, his fame rested on a very\r\nfew grand outbursts--some matured, prepared, deliberated--others\r\nspontaneous. He left only three great comedies, and perhaps we may say\r\nonly one really grand. In the same way he made only two great speeches,\r\nor perhaps we may say only one. His wit on the other hand--though that\r\ntoo is said to have been studied--was the constant accompaniment of his\r\ndaily life, and Sheridan has not left two or three celebrated bon-mots,\r\nbut a hundred.\r\n\r\nBut even in his political career his wit, which must then have been\r\nspontaneous, won him almost as much fame as his eloquence, which he\r\nseems to have reserved for great occasions. He was the wit of the House.\r\nWit, ridicule, satire, quiet, cool, and easy sneers, always made in good\r\ntemper, and always therefore the more bitter, were his weapons, and they\r\nstruck with unerring accuracy. At that time--nor at that time only--the\r\n'Den of Thieves,' as Cobbett called our senate, was a cockpit as vulgar\r\nand personal as the present Congress of the United States. Party-spirit\r\nmeant more than it has ever done since, and scarcely less than it had\r\nmeant when the throne itself was the stake for which parties played some\r\nforty years before. There was, in fact a substantial personal centre for\r\neach side. The one party rallied round a respectable but maniac monarch,\r\nwhose mental afflictions took the most distressing form, the other round\r\nhis gay, handsome, dissolute--nay disgusting--son, at once his rival and\r\nhis heir. The spirit of each party was therefore personal, and their\r\nattacks on one another were more personal than anything we can imagine\r\nin the present day in so respectably ridiculous a conclave as the House\r\nof Commons. It was little for one honourable gentleman to give another\r\nhonourable gentleman the lie direct before the eyes of the country. The\r\nhonourable gentlemen descended--or, as they thought, ascended--to the\r\nmost vehement invective, and such was at times the torrent of personal\r\nabuse which parties heaped on one another, while good-natured John Bull\r\nlooked on and smiled at his rulers, that, as in the United States of\r\nto-day, a debate was often the prelude to a duel. Pitt and Fox, Tierney,\r\nAdam, Fullarton, Lord George Germain, Lord Shelburne, and Governor\r\nJohnstone, all 'vindicated their honour,' as the phrase went, by 'coffee\r\nand pistols for four.' If Sheridan had not to repeat the Bob Acres scene\r\nwith Captain Matthews, it was only because his wonderful good humour\r\ncould put up with a great deal that others thought could only be\r\nexpiated by a hole in the waistcoat.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of the Marquis of Rockingham the dramatist enjoyed\r\nthe pleasures of office for less than a year as one of the Under\r\nSecretaries of State in 1782. In the next year we find him making a\r\nhappy retort on Pitt, who had somewhat vulgarly alluded to his being a\r\ndramatic author. It was on the American question, perhaps the bitterest\r\nthat ever called forth the acrimony of parties in the House. Sheridan,\r\nfrom boyhood, had been taunted with being the son of an actor. One can\r\nhardly credit this fact, just after Garrick had raised the profession of\r\nan actor to so great an eminence in the social scale. He had been called\r\n'the player boy' at school, and his election at Brookes' had been\r\nopposed on the same grounds. It was evidently his bitterest point, and\r\nPitt probably knew this when, in replying to a speech of the\r\nex-dramatist's he said that 'no man admired more than he did the\r\nabilities of that right honourable gentleman, the elegant sallies of his\r\nthought, the gay effusions of his fancy, his _dramatic_ turns, and his\r\nepigrammatic point; and if they were reserved for the _proper stage,_\r\nthey would, no doubt, receive what the hon. gentleman's abilities always\r\ndid receive, the plaudits of the audience; and it would be his fortune\r\n_sui plausu gaudere theatri_. But this was not the proper scene for the\r\nexhibition of those elegancies.' This was vulgar in Pitt, and probably\r\nevery one felt so. But Sheridan rose, cool and collected, and quietly\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n'On the particular sort of personality which the right hon. gentleman\r\nhas thought proper to make use of, I need not make any comment. The\r\npropriety, the taste, the gentlemanly point of it, must have been\r\nobvious to the House. But let me assure the right hon. gentleman that I\r\ndo now, and will at any time he chooses to repeat this sort of allusion,\r\nmeet it with the most sincere good humour. Nay, I will say more:\r\nflattered and encouraged by the right hon. gentleman's panegyric on my\r\ntalents, if ever I again engage in the compositions he alludes to, I may\r\nbe tempted to an act of presumption--to attempt an improvement on one of\r\nBen Jonson's best characters, the character of the _Angry Boy_, in the\r\n\"Alchemist.\"'\r\n\r\nThe fury of Pitt, contrasted with the coolness of the man he had so\r\nshamefully attacked, made this sally irresistible, and from that time\r\nneither 'the angry boy' himself, nor any of his colleagues, were anxious\r\nto twit Sheridan on his dramatic pursuits.\r\n\r\nPitt wanted to lay a tax on every horse that started in a race. Lord\r\nSurry, a _turfish_ individual of the day, proposed one of five pounds on\r\nthe winner. Sheridan, rising, told his lordship that the next time he\r\nvisited Newmarket he would probably be greeted with the line:--\r\n\r\n  'Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold--.'\r\n\r\nLord Rolie, the butt of the Opposition, who had attacked him in the\r\nfamous satire, 'The Rolliad,' so popular that it went through twenty-two\r\neditions in twenty-seven years, accused Sheridan of inflammatory\r\nspeeches among the operatives of the northern counties on the cotton\r\nquestion. Sheridan retorted by saying that he believed Lord Rolle must\r\nrefer to 'Compositions less prosaic, but more popular' (meaning the\r\n'Rolliad'), and thus successfully turned the laugh against him.\r\n\r\nIt was Grattan, I think, who said, 'When I can't talk sense, I talk\r\nmetaphor.' Sheridan often talked metaphor, though he sometimes mingled\r\nit with sense. His famous speech about the Begums of Oude is full of it,\r\nbut we have one or two instances before that. Thus on the Duke of\r\nRichmond's report about fortifications, he said, turning to the duke,\r\nthat 'holding in his hand the report made by the Board of Officers, he\r\ncomplimented the noble president on his talents as an _engineer_, which\r\nwere strongly evinced in planning and constructing that very paper....\r\nHe has made it a contest of posts, and conducted his reasoning not less\r\non principles of trigonometry than of logic. There are certain\r\nassumptions thrown up, like advanced works, to keep the enemy at a\r\ndistance from the principal object of debate; strong provisos protect\r\nand cover the flanks of his assertions, his very queries are his\r\ncasemates,' and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Mulgrave said, on another occasion, that any man using his\r\ninfluence to obtain a vote for the crown _ought_ to lose his head,\r\nSheridan quietly remarked, that he was glad his lordship had said\r\n'_ought_ to lose his head,' not _would_ have lost it, for in that case\r\nthe learned gentleman would not have had that evening '_face_ to have\r\nshown among us.'\r\n\r\nSuch are a few of his well-remembered replies in the House; but his fame\r\nas an orator rested on the splendid speeches which he made at the\r\nimpeachment of Warren Hastings. The first of these was made in the House\r\non the 7th of February, 1787. The whole story of the corruption,\r\nextortions, and cruelty of the worst of many bad rulers who have been\r\nimposed upon that unhappy nation of Hindostan, and who ignorant how to\r\n_parcere subjectis_, have gone on in their unjust oppression, only\r\nrendering it the more dangerous by weak concessions, is too well known\r\nto need a recapitulation here. The worst feature in the whole of\r\nHastings' misconduct was, perhaps, his treatment of those unfortunate\r\nladies whose money he coveted, the Begums of Oude. The Opposition was\r\ndetermined to make the governor-general's conduct a state question, but\r\ntheir charges had been received with little attention, till on this day\r\nSheridan rose to denounce the cruel extortioner. He spoke for five hours\r\nand a half, and surpassed all he had ever said in eloquence. The subject\r\nwas one to find sympathy in the hearts of Englishmen, who, though they\r\nbeat their own wives, are always indignant at a man who dares to lay a\r\nlittle finger on those of anybody else. Then, too, the subject was\r\nOriental: it might even be invested with something of romance and\r\npoetry; the zenanah, sacred in the eyes of the oppressed natives, had\r\nbeen ruthlessly insulted, under a glaring Indian sun, amid the\r\nluxuriance of Indian foliage, these acts had been committed, &c. &c. It\r\nwas a fertile theme for a poet; and how little soever Sheridan cared for\r\nthe Begums and their wrongs--and that he did care little appears from\r\nwhat he afterwards said of Hastings himself--he could evidently make a\r\ntelling speech out of the theme, and he did so. Walpole says that he\r\nturned everybody's head. 'One heard everybody in the street raving on\r\nthe wonders of that speech; for my part, I cannot believe it was so\r\nsupernatural as they say.' He affirms that there must be a witchery in\r\nMr. Sheridan, who had no diamonds--as Hastings had--to win favour with,\r\nand says that the Opposition may be fairly charged with sorcery. Burke\r\ndeclared the speech to be 'the most astonishing effort of eloquence,\r\nargument, and wit united, of which there was any record or tradition.'\r\nFox affirmed that 'all he had ever heard, all he had ever read, when\r\ncompared with it, dwindled into nothing, and vanished like vapour before\r\nthe sun.' But these were partizans. Even Pitt acknowledged 'that it\r\nsurpassed all the eloquence of ancient and modern times, and possessed\r\neverything that genius or art could furnish to agitate and control the\r\nhuman mind.' One member confessed himself so unhinged by it, that he\r\nmoved an adjournment, because he could not, in his then state of mind,\r\ngive an unbiassed vote. But the highest testimony was that of Logan, the\r\ndefender of Hastings. At the end of the first hour of the speech, he\r\nsaid to a friend, 'All this is declamatory assertion without proof.'\r\nAnother hour's speaking, and he muttered, 'This is a most wonderful\r\noration!' A third, and he confessed 'Mr. Hastings has acted very\r\nunjustifiably.' At the end of the fourth, he exclaimed, 'Mr. Hastings is\r\na most atrocious criminal.' And before the speaker had sat down, he\r\nvehemently protested that 'Of all monsters of iniquity, the most\r\nenormous is Warren Hastings.'\r\n\r\nSuch in those days was the effect of eloquence; an art which has been\r\neschewed in the present House of Commons, and which our newspapers\r\naffect to think is much out of place in an assembly met for calm\r\ndeliberation. Perhaps they are right; but oh! for the golden words of a\r\nSheridan, a Fox, even a Pitt and Burke.\r\n\r\nIt is said, though not proved, that on this same night of Sheridan's\r\nglory in the House of Commons, his 'School for Scandal' was acted with\r\n'rapturous applause' at Covent Garden, and his 'Duenna' no less\r\nsuccessfully at Drury Lane. What a pitch of glory for the dunce who had\r\nbeen shamed into learning Greek verbs at Harrow! Surely Dr. Parr must\r\nthen have confessed that a man can be great without the classics--nay,\r\nwithout even a decent English education, for Sheridan knew comparatively\r\nlittle of history and literature, certainly less than the men against\r\nwhom he was pitted or whose powers he emulated. He has been known to say\r\nto his friends, when asked to take part with them on some important\r\nquestion, 'You know I'm an ignoramus--instruct me and I'll do my best.'\r\nHe had even to rub up his arithmetic when he thought he had some chance\r\nof being made Chancellor of the Exchequer; but, perhaps, many a\r\nstatesman before and after him has done as much as that.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that after such a speech in the House, the celebrated trial\r\nwhich commenced in the beginning of the following year should have\r\nroused the attention of the whole nation. The proceedings opened in\r\nWestminster Hall, the noblest room in England, on the 13th of February,\r\n1788. The Queen and four of her daughters were seated in the Duke of\r\nNewcastle's box; the Prince of Wales walked in at the head of a hundred\r\nand fifty peers of the realm. The spectacle was imposing enough. But the\r\ntrial proceeded slowly for some months, and it was not till the 3rd of\r\nJune that Sheridan rose to make his second great speech on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe excitement was then at its highest. Two-thirds of the peers with the\r\npeeresses and their daughters were present, and the whole of the vast\r\nhall was crowded to excess. The sun shone in brightly to light up the\r\ngloomy building, and the whole scene was splendid. Such was the\r\nenthusiasm that people paid _fifty guineas_ for a ticket to hear the\r\nfirst orator of his day, for such he then was. The actor's son felt the\r\nenlivening influence of a full audience. He had been long preparing for\r\nthis moment, and he threw into his speech all the theatrical effect of\r\nwhich he had studied much and inherited more. He spoke for many hours on\r\nthe 3rd, 5th, and 6th, and concluded with these words:\r\n\r\n'They (the House of Commons) exhort you by everything that calls\r\nsublimely upon the heart of man, by the majesty of that justice which\r\nthis bold man has libelled, by the wide fame of your own tribunal, by\r\nthe sacred pledges by which you swear in the solemn hour of decision,\r\nknowing that that decision will then bring you the highest reward that\r\never blessed the heart of man, the consciousness of having done the\r\ngreatest act of mercy for the world that the earth has ever yet received\r\nfrom any hand but heaven!--My Lords, I have done.'\r\n\r\nSheridan's valet was very proud of his master's success, and as he had\r\nbeen to hear the speech, was asked what part he considered the finest.\r\nPlush replied by putting himself into his master's attitude, and\r\nimitating his voice admirably, solemnly uttering, 'My Lords, I have\r\ndone!' He should have added the word 'nothing.' Sheridan's eloquence had\r\nno more effect than the clear proof of Hastings' guilt, and the\r\nimpeachment, as usual, was but a troublesome subterfuge, to satisfy the\r\nOpposition and dust the eyeballs of the country.\r\n\r\nSheridan's great speech was made. The orator has concluded his oration;\r\nfame was complete, and no more was wanted, Adieu, then, blue-books and\r\nparties, and come on the last grand profession of this man of many\r\ntalents--that of the wit. That it was a profession there can be no\r\ndoubt, for he lived on it, it was all his capital. He paid his bills in\r\nthat coin alone: he paid his workmen, his actors, carpenters, builders\r\nwith no more sterling metal; with that ready tool he extracted loans\r\nfrom the very men who came to be paid; that brilliant ornament\r\nmaintained his reputation in the senate, and his character in society.\r\nBut wit without wisdom--the froth without the fluid--the capital without\r\nthe pillar--is but a poor fortune, a wretched substitute for real worth\r\nand honest utility. For a time men forgave to Mr. Sheridan--extravagant\r\nand reckless as he was--what would long before have brought an honester,\r\nbetter, but less amusing man to a debtor's prison and the contempt of\r\nsociety; but only for a time was this career possible.\r\n\r\nSheridan has now reached the pinnacle of his fame, and from this point\r\nwe have to trace that decline which ended so awfully.\r\n\r\nWhilst we call him a dishonest man, we must not be supposed to imply\r\nthat he was so in heart. It is pleaded for him that he tricked his\r\ncreditors 'for the fun of the thing,' like a modern Robin Hood, and like\r\nthat forester bold, he was mightily generous with other men's money.\r\nDeception is deception whether in sport or earnest, and Sheridan, no\r\ndoubt, made it a very profitable employment. He had always a taste for\r\nthe art of duping, and he had begun early in life--soon after leaving\r\nHarrow. He was spending a few days at Bristol, and wanted a pair of new\r\nboots, but could not afford to pay for them. Shortly before he left, he\r\ncalled on two bootmakers, and ordered of each a pair, promising payment\r\non delivery. He fixed the morning of his departure for the tradesmen to\r\nsend in their goods. When the first arrived he tried on the boots,\r\ncomplaining that that for the _right_ foot pinched a little, and ordered\r\nCrispin to take it back, stretch it, and bring it again at nine the next\r\nmorning. The second arrived soon after, and this time it was the boot\r\nfor the _left_ foot which pinched. Same complaint; same order given;\r\neach had taken away only the pinching boot, and left the other behind.\r\nThe same afternoon Sheridan left in his new boots for town, and when the\r\ntwo shoemakers called at nine the next day, each with a boot in his\r\nhand, we can imagine their disgust at finding how neatly they had been\r\nduped.\r\n\r\nAnecdotes of this kind swarm in every account of Richard Sheridan--many\r\nof them, perhaps, quite apocryphal, others exaggerated, or attributed to\r\nthis noted trickster, but all tending to show how completely he was\r\nmaster of this high art. His ways of eluding creditors used to delight\r\nme, I remember, when an Oxford boy, and they are only paralleled by\r\nOxford stories. One of these may not be generally known, and was worthy\r\nof Sheridan. Every Oxonian knows Hall, the boat-builder at Folly Bridge.\r\nMrs. Hall was, in my time, proprietress of those dangerous skiffs and\r\nnutshell canoes which we young harebrains delighted to launch on the\r\nIsis. Some youthful Sheridanian had a long account with this elderly and\r\nbashful personage, who had applied in vain for her money, till, coming\r\none day to his rooms, she announced her intention not to leave till the\r\nmoney was paid. 'Very well, Mrs. Hall, then you must sit down and make\r\nyourself comfortable while I dress, for I am going out directly.' Mrs.\r\nH. sat down composedly, and with equal composure the youth took off his\r\ncoat. Mrs. H. was not abashed, but in another moment the debtor removed\r\nhis waistcoat also. Mrs. H. was still immoveable. Sundry other articles\r\nof dress followed, and the good lady began to be nervous. 'Now, Mrs.\r\nHall, you can stay if you like, but I assure you that I am going to\r\nchange _all_ my dress.' Suiting the action to the word, he began to\r\nremove his lower garments, when Mrs. Hall, shocked and furious, rushed\r\nfrom the room.\r\n\r\nThis reminds us of Sheridan's treatment of a female creditor. He had for\r\nsome years hired his carriage-horses from Edbrooke in Clarges Street,\r\nand his bill was a heavy one. Mrs. Edbrooke wanted a new bonnet, and\r\nblew up her mate for not insisting on payment. The curtain lecture was\r\nfollowed next day by a refusal to allow Mr. Sheridan to have the horses\r\ntill the account was settled. Mr. Sheridan sent the politest possible\r\nmessage in reply, begging that Mrs. Edbrooke would allow his coachman to\r\ndrive her in his own carriage to his door, and promising that the matter\r\nshould be satisfactorily arranged. The good woman was delighted, dressed\r\nin her best, and, bill in hand, entered the M.P.'s chariot. Sheridan\r\nmeanwhile had given orders to his servants. Mrs. Edbrooke was shown up\r\ninto the back drawing-room, where a slight luncheon, of which she was\r\nbegged to partake, was laid out; and she was assured that her debtor\r\nwould not keep her waiting long, though for the moment engaged. The\r\nhorse-dealer's wife sat down and discussed a wing of chicken and glass\r\nof wine, and in the meantime her victimizer had been watching his\r\nopportunity, slipped down stairs, jumped into the vehicle, and drove\r\noff. Mrs. Edbrooke finished her lunch and waited in vain; ten minutes,\r\ntwenty, thirty, passed, and then she rang the bell: 'Very sorry, ma'am,\r\nbut Mr. Sheridan went out on important business half an hour ago.' 'And\r\nthe carriage?'--'Oh, ma'am, Mr. Sheridan never walks.'\r\n\r\nHe procured his wine in the same style. Chalier, the wine-merchant, was\r\nhis creditor to a large amount, and had stopped supplies. Sheridan was\r\nto give a grand dinner to the leaders of the Opposition, and had no port\r\nor sherry to offer them. On the morning of the day fixed he sent for\r\nChalier, and told him he wanted to settle his account. The importer,\r\nmuch pleased, said he would go home and bring it at once. 'Stay,' cried\r\nthe debtor, 'will you dine with me to-day; Lord----, Sir----, and\r\nSo-and-so are coming.' Chalier was flattered and readily accepted.\r\nReturning to his office, he told his clerk that he should dine with Mr.\r\nSheridan, and therefore leave early. At the proper hour he arrived in\r\nfull dress, and was no sooner in the house., than his host despatched a\r\nmessage to the clerk at the office, saying that Mr. Chalier wished him\r\nto send up at once three dozen of Burgundy, two of claret, two of port,\r\n&c., &c. Nothing seemed more natural, and the wine was forwarded, just\r\nin time for the dinner. It was highly praised by the guests, who asked\r\nSheridan who was his wine-merchant. The host bowed towards Chalier, gave\r\nhim a high recommendation, and impressed him with the belief that he was\r\ntelling a polite falsehood in order to secure him other customers.\r\nLittle did he think that he was drinking his own wine, and that it was\r\nnot, and probably never would be, paid for!\r\n\r\nIn like manner, when he wanted a particular Burgundy an innkeeper at\r\nRichmond, who declined to supply it till his bill was paid, he sent for\r\nthe man, and had no sooner seen him safe in the house than he drove off\r\nto Richmond, saw his wife, told her he had just had a conversation with\r\nmine host, settled everything, and would, to save them trouble, take the\r\nwine with him in his carriage. The condescension overpowered the good\r\nwoman, who ordered it at once to be produced, and Sheridan drove home\r\nabout the time that her husband was returning to Richmond, weary of\r\nwaiting for his absent debtor. But this kind of trickery could not\r\nalways succeed without some knowledge of his creditor's character. In\r\nthe case of Holloway, the lawyer, Sheridan took advantage of his\r\nwell-known vanity of his judgment of horse-flesh. Kelly gives the\r\nanecdote as authentic. He was walking one day with Sheridan, close to\r\nthe churchyard of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, when, as ill-luck would\r\nhave it, up comes Holloway on horseback, and in a furious rage,\r\ncomplains that he has called on Mr. Sheridan time and again in Hertford\r\nStreet, and can never gain admittance. He proceeds to violent threats,\r\nand slangs his debtor roundly. Sheridan, cool as a whole bed of\r\ncucumbers, takes no notice of these attacks, but quietly exclaims: 'What\r\na beautiful creature you're riding, Holloway!' The lawyer's weak point\r\nwas touched.\r\n\r\n'You were speaking to me the other day about a horse for Mrs. Sheridan;\r\nnow this would be a treasure for a lady.'\r\n\r\n'Does he canter well?' asks Sheridan, with a look of business.\r\n\r\n'Like Pegasus himself.'\r\n\r\n'If that's the case, I shouldn't mind, Holloway, stretching a point for\r\nhim. Do you mind showing me his paces?'\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' replies the lawyer, only too happy to show off his own:\r\nand touching up the horse, put him to a quiet canter. The moment is not\r\nto be lost; the churchyard gate is at hand; Sheridan slips in, knowing\r\nthat his mounted tormentor cannot follow him, and there bursts into a\r\nroar of laughter, which is joined in by Kelly, but not by the returning\r\nHolloway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"A TREASURE FOR A LADY\"--SHERIDAN AND THE LAWYER.]\r\n\r\nBut if he escaped an importunate lawyer once in a way like this, he\r\nRequired more ingenuity to get rid of the limbs of the law, when they\r\ncame, as they did frequently in his later years. It was the fashionable\r\nthing in bygone novels of the 'Pelham' school, and Even in more recent\r\ncomedies, to introduce a well-dressed sheriff's officer at a dinner\r\nparty or ball, and take him through a variety of predicaments, ending,\r\nat length, in the revelation of his real character; and probably some\r\nsuch scene is still enacted from time to time in the houses of the\r\nextravagant: but Sheridan's adventures with bailiffs seem to have\r\nexcited more attention. In the midst of his difficulties he never ceased\r\nto entertain his friends, and 'why should he not do so, since he had not\r\nto pay?' 'Pay your bills, sir? what a shameful waste of money!' he once\r\nsaid. Thus, one day a young friend was met by him and taken back to\r\ndinner, 'quite in a quiet way, just to meet a very old friend of mine, a\r\nman of great talent, and most charming companion.' When they arrived\r\nthey found 'the old friend' already installed, and presenting a somewhat\r\nunpolished appearance, which the young man explained to himself by\r\nsupposing him to be a genius of somewhat low extraction. His habits at\r\ndinner, the eager look, the free use of his knife, and so forth, were\r\nall accounted for in the same way, but that he was a genius of no slight\r\ndistinction was clear from the deep respect and attention with which\r\nSheridan listened to his slightest remarks, and asked his opinion on\r\nEnglish poetry. Meanwhile Sheridan and the servant between them plied\r\nthe genius very liberally with wine: and the former, rising, made him a\r\ncomplimentary speech on his critical powers, while the young guest, who\r\nhad heard nothing from his lips but the commonest platitudes in very bad\r\nEnglish, grew more and more amused. The wine told in time, the 'genius'\r\nsang songs which were more Saxon than delicate, talked loud, clapped his\r\nhost on the shoulder, and at last rolled fairly under the table. 'Now,'\r\nsaid Sheridan, quite calmly to his young friend, 'we will go up stairs:\r\nand, Jack,' (to his servant) 'take that man's hat and give him to the\r\nwatch.' He then explained in the same calm tone, that this was a bailiff\r\nof whose company he was growing rather tired, and wanted to be freed.\r\n\r\nBut his finest tricks were undoubtedly those by which he turned,\r\nharlequin-like, a creditor into a lender This was done by sheer force of\r\npersuasion, by assuming a lofty indignation, or by putting forth his\r\nclaims to mercy with the most touching eloquence over which he would\r\nlaugh heartily when his point was gained. He was often compelled to do\r\nthis during his theatrical management, when a troublesome creditor might\r\nhave interfered with the success of the establishment. He talked over an\r\nupholsterer who came with a writ for £350 till the latter handed him,\r\ninstead, a cheque for £200. He once, when the actors struck for arrears\r\nof wages to the amount of £3,000, and his bankers refused flatly to\r\nKelly to advance another penny, screwed the whole sum out of them in\r\nless than a quarter of an hour by sheer talk. He got a gold watch from\r\nHarris, the manager, with whom he had broken several appointments, by\r\ncomplaining that as he had no watch he could never tell the time fixed\r\nfor their meetings; and, as for putting off pressing creditors, and\r\nturning furious foes into affectionate friends, he was such an adept at\r\nit, that his reputation as a dun-destroyer is quite on a par with his\r\nfame as comedian and orator.\r\n\r\nHoaxing, a style of amusement fortunately out of fashion how, was almost\r\na passion with him, and his practical jokes were as merciless as his\r\nsatire. He and Tickell, who had married the sister of his wife, used to\r\nplay them off on one another like a couple of schoolboys. One evening,\r\nfor instance, Sheridan got together all the crockery in the house and\r\narranged it in a dark passage, leaving a small channel for escape for\r\nhimself, and then, having teased Tickell till he rushed after him,\r\nbounded out and picked his way gingerly along the passage. His friend\r\nfollowed him unwittingly, and at the first step stumbled over a\r\nwashhand-basin, and fell forwards with a crash on piles of plates and\r\ndishes, which cut his face and hands in a most cruel manner, Sheridan\r\nall the while laughing immoderately at the end of the passage, secure\r\nfrom vengeance.\r\n\r\nBut his most impudent hoax was that on the Honourable House of Commons\r\nitself. Lord Belgrave had made a very telling speech which he wound up\r\nwith a Greek quotation, loudly applauded. Sheridan had no arguments to\r\nmeet him with; so rising, he admitted the force of his lordship's\r\nquotation (of which he probably did not understand a word), but added\r\nthat had he gone a little farther, and completed the passage, he would\r\nhave seen that the context completely altered the sense. He would prove\r\nit to the House, he said, and forthwith rolled forth a grand string of\r\nmajestic gibberish so well imitated that the whole assembly cried,\r\n'Hear, hear!' Lord Belgrave rose again, and frankly admitted that the\r\npassage had the meaning ascribed to it by the honourable gentleman, and\r\nthat he had overlooked it at the moment. At the end of the evening, Fox,\r\nwho prided himself on his classical lore, came up to and said to him,\r\n'Sheridan, how came you to be so ready with that passage? It is\r\ncertainly as you say, but I was not aware of it before you quoted it.'\r\nSheridan was wise enough to keep his own counsel for the time, but must\r\nhave felt delightfully tickled at the ignorance of the would-be savants\r\nwith whom he was politically associated. Probably Sheridan could not at\r\nany time have quoted a whole passage of Greek on the spur of the moment;\r\nbut it is certain that he had not kept up his classics, and at the time\r\nin question must have forgotten the little he ever knew of them.\r\n\r\nThis facility of imitating exactly the sound of a language without\r\nintroducing a single word of it is not so very rare, but is generally\r\npossessed in greater readiness by those who know no tongue but their\r\nown, and are therefore more struck by the strangeness of a foreign one,\r\nwhen hearing it. Many of us have heard Italian songs in which there was\r\nnot a word of actual Italian sung in London burlesques, and some of us\r\nhave laughed at Levassor's capital imitation of English; but perhaps the\r\ncleverest mimic of the kind I ever heard was M. Laffitte, brother of\r\nthat famous banker who made his fortune by picking up a pin. This\r\ngentleman could speak nothing but French, but had been brought by his\r\nbusiness into contact with foreigners of every race at Paris, and when\r\nhe once began his little trick, it was impossible to believe that he was\r\nnot possessed of a gift of tongues. His German and Italian were good\r\nenough, but his English was so splendidly counterfeited, that after\r\nlistening to him for a short time, I suddenly heard a roar of laughter\r\nfrom all present, for I had actually unconsciously _answered him_,\r\n'Yes,' 'No,' 'Exactly so,' and 'I quite agree with you!'\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly much of Sheridan's depravity must be attributed to his\r\nintimacy with a man whom it was a great honour to a youngster then to\r\nknow, but who would probably be scouted even from a London club in the\r\npresent day--the Prince of Wales. The part of a courtier is always\r\ndegrading enough to play; but to be courtier to a prince whose favour\r\nwas to be won by proficiency in vice, and audacity in follies, to\r\ntruckle to his tastes, to win his smiles by the invention of a new\r\npleasure and his approbation by the plotting of a new villany, what an\r\noffice for the author of 'The School for Scandal,' and the orator\r\nrenowned for denouncing the wickednesses of Warren Hastings! What a life\r\nfor the young poet who had wooed and won the Maid of Bath--for the man\r\nof strong domestic affections, who wept over his father's sternness, and\r\nloved his son only too well! It was bad enough for such mere worldlings\r\nas Captain Hanger or Beau Brummell, but for a man of higher and purer\r\nfeelings, like Sheridan, who, with all his faults, had some poetry in\r\nhis soul, such a career was doubly disgraceful.\r\n\r\nIt was at the house of the beautiful, lively, and adventurous Duchess of\r\nDevonshire, the partizan of Charles James Fox, who loved him or his\r\ncause--for Fox and Liberalism were often one in ladies' eyes--so well,\r\nthat she could give Steele, the butcher, a kiss for his vote, that\r\nSheridan first met the prince--then a boy in years, but already more\r\nthan an adult in vice. No doubt the youth whom Fox, Brummell, Hanger,\r\nLord Surrey, Sheridan, the tailors and the women, combined to turn at\r\nonce into the finest gentleman and greatest blackguard in Europe, was at\r\nthat time as fascinating in appearance and manner as any one, prince or\r\nnot, could be. He was by far the handsomest of the Hanoverians, and had\r\nthe least amount of their sheepish look. He possessed all their taste\r\nand capacity, for gallantry, with apparently none of the German\r\ncoarseness which certain other Princes of Wales exhibited in their\r\namorous address. _His_ coarseness was of a more sensual, but less\r\nimperious kind. He _had_ his redeeming points, which few of his\r\nancestors had, and his liberal hand and warm heart won him friends,\r\nwhere his conduct could win him little else than contempt. Sheridan was\r\nintroduced to him by Fox, and Mrs. Sheridan by the Duchess of\r\nDevonshire. The prince had that which always takes with Englishmen--a\r\nreadiness of conviviality, and a recklessness of character. He was ready\r\nto chat, drink, and bet with Sheridan, or any new comer equally well\r\nrecommended, and an introduction to young George was always followed by\r\nan easy recognition. With all this he managed to keep up a certain\r\namount of royal dignity under the most trying circumstances, but he had\r\nnone of that easy grace which made Charles II. beloved by his\r\nassociates. When the George had gone too far, he had no resource but to\r\ncut the individual with whom he had hobbed and nobbed, and he was as\r\nungrateful in his enmities as he was ready with his friendship. Brummell\r\nhad taught him to dress, and Sheridan had given him wiser counsels: he\r\nquarrelled with both for trifles, which, if he had had real dignity,\r\nwould never have occurred, and if he had had real friendship, would\r\neasily have been overlooked.\r\n\r\nSheridan's breach with the prince was honourable to him. He could not\r\nwholly approve of the conduct of that personage and his ministers, and\r\nhe told him openly that his life was at his service, but his character\r\nwas the property of the country. The prince replied that Sheridan 'might\r\nimpeach his ministers on the morrow--that would not impair their\r\nfriendship;' yet turned on his heel, and was never his friend again.\r\nWhen, again, the 'delicate investigation' came off, he sent for\r\nSheridan, and asked his aid. The latter replied, 'Your royal highness\r\nhonours me, but I will never take part against a woman, whether she be\r\nright or wrong.' His political courage atones somewhat for the want of\r\nmoral courage he displayed in pandering to the prince's vices.\r\n\r\nMany an anecdote is told of Sheridan and 'Wales'--many, indeed, that\r\ncannot be repeated. Their bets were often of the coarsest nature, won by\r\nSheridan in the coarsest manner. A great intimacy sprang up between the\r\ntwo reprobates, and Sheridan became one of the satellites of that\r\ndissolute prince. There are few of the stories of their adventures which\r\ncan be told in a work like this, but we may give one or two specimens of\r\nthe less disgraceful character:--\r\n\r\nThe Prince, Lord Surrey, and Sheridan were in the habit of seeking\r\nnightly adventures of any kind that suggested itself to their lively\r\nminds. A low tavern, still in existence, was the rendezvous of the heir\r\nto the crown and his noble and distinguished associates. This was the\r\n'Salutation,' in Tavistock Court, Covent Garden, a night house for\r\ngardeners and countrymen, and for the sharpers who fleeced both, and was\r\nkept by a certain Mother Butler, who favoured in every way the\r\nadventurous designs of her exalted guests. Here wigs, smock-frocks, and\r\nother disguises were in readiness; and here, at call, was to be found a\r\nready-made magistrate, whose sole occupation was to deliver the young\r\nHaroun and his companions from the dilemmas which their adventures\r\nnaturally brought them into, and which were generally more or less\r\nconcerned with the watch. Poor old watch! what happy days, when members\r\nof parliament, noblemen, and future monarchs condescended to break thy\r\nbob-wigged head! and--blush, Z 350, immaculate constable--to toss thee a\r\nguinea to buy plaster with.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the other disguise, _aliases_ were of course assumed. The\r\nprince went by the name of Blackstock, Greystock was my Lord Surrey, and\r\nThinstock Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The treatment of women by the\r\npolice is traditional. The 'unfortunate'--unhappy creatures!--are their\r\npet aversion; and once in their clutches, receive no mercy. The\r\n'Charley' of old was quite as brutal as the modern Hercules of the\r\nglazed hat, and the three adventurers showed an amount of zeal worthy of\r\na nobler cause, in rescuing the drunken Lais from his grasp. On one\r\noccasion they seem to have hit on a 'deserving case;' a slight skirmish\r\nwith the watch ended in a rescue, and the erring creature was taken off\r\nto a house of respectability sufficient to protect her. Here she told\r\nher tale, which, however improbable, turned out to be true. It was a\r\nvery old, a very simple one--the common history of many a frail, foolish\r\ngirl, cursed with beauty, and the prey of a practised seducer. The main\r\npeculiarity lay in the fact of her respectable birth, and his position,\r\nshe being the daughter of a solicitor, he the son of a nobleman.\r\nMarriage was promised, of course, as it has been promised a million\r\ntimes with the same intent, and for the millionth time was not\r\nperformed. The seducer took her from her home, kept her quiet for a\r\ntime, and when the novelty was gone, abandoned her. The old story went\r\non; poverty--a child--a mother's love struggling with a sense of\r\nshame--a visit to her father's house at the last moment, as a forlorn\r\nhope. There she had crawled on her knees to one of those relentless\r\nparents on whose heads lie the utter loss of their children's souls. The\r\nfalse pride, that spoke of the blot on his name, the disgrace of his\r\nhouse--when a Saviour's example should have bid him forgive and raise\r\nthe penitent in her misery from the dust--whispered him to turn her from\r\nhis door. He ordered the footman to put her out. The man, a nobleman in\r\nplush, moved by his young mistress's utter misery, would not obey though\r\nit cost him his place, and the harder-hearted father himself thrust his\r\nstarving child into the cold street, into the drizzling rain, and\r\nslammed the door upon her cries of agony. The footman slipped out after\r\nher, and five shillings--a large sum for him--found its way from his\r\nkind hand to hers. Now the common ending might have come; now\r\nstarvation, the slow, unwilling, recourse to more shame and deeper vice;\r\nthen the forced hilarity, the unreal smile, which in so many of these\r\npoor creatures hides a canker at the heart; the gradual\r\ndegradation--lower still and lower--oblivion for a moment sought in the\r\nbottle--a life of sin and death ended in a hospital. The will of\r\nProvidence turned the frolic of three voluptuaries to good account; the\r\nprince gave his purse-full, Sheridan his one last guinea for her present\r\nneeds: the name of the good-hearted Plush was discovered, and he was\r\ntaken into Carlton House, where he soon became known as Roberts, the\r\nprince's confidential servant: and Sheridan bestirred himself to rescue\r\nfor ever the poor lady, whose beauty still remained as a temptation. He\r\nprocured her a situation, where she studied for the stage, on which she\r\neventually appeared. 'All's well that ends well:' her secret was kept,\r\ntill one admirer came honourably forward. To him it was confided, and he\r\nwas noble enough to forgive the one false step of youth. She was well\r\nmarried, and the boy for whom she had suffered so much fell at\r\nTrafalgar, a lieutenant in the navy.\r\n\r\nTo better men such an adventure would have been a solemn warning; such a\r\ntale, told by the ruined one herself, a sermon, every word of which\r\nwould have clung to their memories. What effect, if any, it may have had\r\non Blackstock and his companions must have been very fleeting.\r\n\r\nIt is not so very long since the Seven Dials and St. Giles' were haunts\r\nof wickedness and dens of thieves, into which the police scarcely dared\r\nto penetrate. Probably their mysteries would have afforded more\r\namusement to the artist and the student of character than to the mere\r\nseeker of adventure, but it was still, I remember, in my early days, a\r\ngreat feat to visit by night one of the noted 'cribs' to which 'the\r\nprofession' which fills Newgate was wont to resort. The 'Brown Bear,' in\r\nBroad Street, St. Giles', was one of these pleasant haunts, and thither\r\nthe three adventurers determined to go. This style of adventure is out\r\nof date, and no longer amusing. Of course a fight ensued, in which the\r\nprince and his companions showed immense pluck against terrible odds,\r\nand in which, as one reads in the novels of the 'London Journal' or\r\n'Family Herald,' the natural superiority of the well-born of course\r\ndisplayed itself to great advantage. Surely Bulwer has described such\r\nscenes too graphically in some of his earlier novels to make a minute\r\ndescription here at all necessary; but the reader who is curious in the\r\nmatter may be referred to a work which has recently appeared under the\r\ntitle of 'Sheridan and his Times,' professing to be written by an\r\nOctogenarian, intimate with the hero. The fray ended with the arrival of\r\nthe watch, who rescued Blackstock, Greystock, and Thinstock, and with\r\nDogberryan stupidity carried them off to a neighbouring lock-up. The\r\nexamination which took place was just the occasion for Sheridan's fun to\r\ndisplay itself on, and pretending to turn informer, he succeeded in\r\nbewildering the unfortunate parochial constable, who conducted it, till\r\nthe arrival of the magistrate, whose duty was to deliver his friends\r\nfrom durance vile. The whole scene is well described in the book just\r\nreferred to, with, we presume, a certain amount of idealizing; but the\r\n'Octogenarian' had probably heard the story from Sheridan himself, and\r\nthe main points must be accepted as correct. The affair ended, as usual,\r\nwith a supper at the 'Salutation.'\r\n\r\nWe must now follow Sheridan in his gradual downfall.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes of this--as far as money was concerned--was his\r\nextreme indolence and utter negligence. He trusted far too much to his\r\nready wit and rapid genius. Thus when 'Pizarro' was to appear, day after\r\nday went by, and nothing was done. On the night of representation, only\r\nfour acts out of five were written, and even these had not been\r\nrehearsed, the principal performers, Siddons, Charles Kemble and\r\nBarrymore, having only just received their parts. Sheridan was up in the\r\nprompter's room actually writing the fifth act while the first was being\r\nperformed, and every now and then appeared in the green-room with a\r\nfresh relay of dialogue, and setting all in good humour by his merry\r\nabuse of his own negligence. In spite of this, 'Pizarro' succeeded. He\r\nseldom wrote except at night, and surrounded by a profusion of lights.\r\nWine was his great stimulant in composition, as it has been to better\r\nand worse authors. 'If the thought is slow to come,' he would say, 'a\r\nglass of good wine encourages it; and when it does come, a glass of good\r\nwine rewards it.' Those glasses of good wine, were, unfortunately, even\r\nmore frequent than the good thoughts, many and merry as they were.\r\n\r\nHis neglect of letters was a standing joke against him. He never took\r\nthe trouble to open any that he did not expect, and often left sealed\r\nmany that he was most anxious to read. He once appeared with his begging\r\nface at the Bank, humbly asking an advance of twenty pounds. 'Certainly,\r\nsir; would you like any more?--fifty or a hundred?' said the smiling\r\nclerk. Sheridan was overpowered. He _would_ like a hundred. 'Two or\r\nthree?' asked the scribe. Sheridan thought he was joking, but was ready\r\nfor two or even three--he was always ready for more. But he could not\r\nconceal his surprise. 'Have you not received our letter?' the clerk\r\nasked, perceiving it. Certainly he had received the epistle, which\r\ninformed him that his salary as Receiver-General of Cornwall had been\r\npaid in, but he had never opened it.\r\n\r\nThis neglect of letters once brought him into a troublesome lawsuit\r\nabout the theatre. It was necessary to pay certain demands, and he had\r\napplied to the Duke of Bedford to be his security. The duke had\r\nconsented, and for a whole year his letter of consent remained unopened.\r\nIn the meantime Sheridan had believed that the duke had neglected him,\r\nand allowed the demands to be brought into court.\r\n\r\nIn the same way he had long before committed himself in the affair with\r\nCaptain Matthews. In order to give a public denial of certain reports\r\ncirculated in Bath, he had called upon an editor, requesting him to\r\ninsert the said reports in his paper in order that he might write him a\r\nletter to refute them. The editor at once complied, the calumny was\r\nprinted and published, but Sheridan forgot all about his own refutation,\r\nwhich was applied for in vain till too late.\r\n\r\nOther causes were his extravagance and intemperance. There was an utter\r\nwant of even common moderation in everything he did. Whenever his boyish\r\nspirit suggested any freak, whenever a craving of any kind possessed\r\nhim, no matter what the consequences here or hereafter, he rushed\r\nheedlessly into the indulgence of it. Perhaps the enemy had never an\r\neasier subject to deal with. Any sin in which there was a show of\r\npresent mirth, or easy pleasure, was as easily taken up by Sheridan as\r\nif he had not a single particle of conscience or religious feeling, and\r\nyet we are not at all prepared to say that he lacked either; he had only\r\ndeadened both by excessive indulgence of his fancies. The temptation of\r\nwealth and fame had been too much for the poor and obscure young man who\r\nrose to them so suddenly, and, as so often happens, those very talents\r\nwhich should have been his glory, were, in fact, his ruin.\r\n\r\nHis extravagance was unbounded. At a time when misfortune lay thick upon\r\nhim, and bailiffs were hourly expected, he would invite a large party to\r\na dinner, which a prince might have given, and to which one prince\r\nsometimes sat down. On one occasion, having no plate left from the\r\npawnbroker's, he had to prevail on 'my uncle' to lend him some for a\r\nbanquet he was to give. The spoons and forks were sent, and with them\r\ntwo of his men, who, dressed in livery, waited, no doubt with the most\r\nvigilant attention, on the party. Such at that period was the host's\r\nreputation, when he could not even be trusted not to pledge another\r\nman's property. At one time his income was reckoned at £15,000 a year,\r\nwhen the theatre was prosperous. Of this he is said to have spent not\r\nmore than £5,000 on his household, while the balance went to pay for his\r\nformer follies, debts, and the interest, lawsuits often arising from\r\nmere carelessness and judgments against the theatre! Probably a great\r\ndeal of it was betted away, drank away, thrown away in one way or\r\nanother. As for betting, he generally lost all the wagers he made: as he\r\nsaid himself--'I never made a bet upon my own judgment that I did not\r\nlose; and I never won but one, which I had made against my judgment.'\r\nHis bets were generally laid in hundreds; and though he did not gamble,\r\nhe could of course run through a good deal of money in this way. He\r\nbetted on every possible trifle, but chiefly, it would seem, on\r\npolitical possibilities; the state of the Funds, the result of an\r\nelection, or the downfall of a ministry. Horse-races do not seem to have\r\npossessed any interest for him, and, in fact, he scarcely knew one kind\r\nof horse from another. He was never an adept at field-sports, though\r\nvery ambitious of being thought a sportsman. Once, when staying in the\r\ncountry, he went out with a friend's gamekeeper to shoot pheasants, and\r\nafter wasting a vast amount of powder and shot upon the air, he was only\r\nrescued from ignominy by the sagacity of his companion, who, going a\r\nlittle behind him when a bird rose, brought it down so neatly that\r\nSheridan, believing he had killed it himself, snatched it up, and rushed\r\nbellowing with glee back to the house to show that he _could_ shoot. In\r\nthe same way, he tried his hand at fishing in a wretched little stream\r\nbehind the Deanery at Winchester, using, however, a net, as easier to\r\nhandle than a rod. Some boys, who had watched his want of success a long\r\ntime, at last bought a few pennyworth of pickled herrings, and throwing\r\nthem on the stream, allowed them to float down towards the eager\r\ndisciple of old Izaak. Sheridan saw them coming, rushed in regardless of\r\nhis clothes, cast his net and in great triumph secured them. When he had\r\nlanded his prize, however, there were the boys bursting with laughter,\r\nand Piscator saw he was their dupe. 'Ah!' cried he, laughing in concert,\r\nas he looked at his dripping clothes, 'this is a pretty _pickle_\r\nindeed!'\r\n\r\nHis extravagance was well known to his friends, as well as to his\r\ncreditors. Lord Guildford met him one day. 'Well, Sherry, so you've\r\ntaken a new house, I hear.'--'Yes, and you'll see now that everything\r\nwill go on like clockwork.'--'Ay,' said my lord, with a knowing leer,\r\n'_tick, tick_.' Even his son Tom used to laugh at him for it. 'Tom, if\r\nyou marry that girl, I'll cut you off with a shilling,'--'Then you must\r\nborrow it,' replied the ingenuous youth.[8] Tom sometimes disconcerted\r\nhis father with his inherited wit--his only inheritance. He pressed\r\nurgently for money on one, as on many an occasion. 'I have none,' was\r\nthe reply, as usual; 'there is a pair of pistols up stairs, a horse in\r\nthe enable, the night is dark, and Hounslow Heath at hand.'\r\n\r\n[8: Another version is that Tom replied: 'You don't happen to have it\r\nabout you, sir, do you?']\r\n\r\n'I understand what you mean,' replied young Tom; 'but I tried that last\r\nnight, and unluckily stopped your treasurer, Peake, who told me you had\r\nbeen beforehand with him, and robbed him of every sixpence he had in the\r\nworld.'\r\n\r\nSo much for the respect of son to father!\r\n\r\nPapa had his revenge on the young wit, when Tom, talking of Parliament,\r\nannounced his intention of entering it on an independent basis, ready to\r\nbe bought by the highest bidder 'I shall write on my forehead,' said he,\r\n\"To let.\"'\r\n\r\n'And under that, Tom, \"Unfurnished,\"' rejoined Sherry the elder. The\r\njoke is now stale enough.\r\n\r\nBut Sheridan was more truly witty in putting down a young braggart whom\r\nhe met at dinner at a country-house. There are still to be found, like\r\nthe bones of dead asses in a field newly ploughed, in some parts of the\r\ncountry, youths, who are so hopelessly behind their age, and indeed\r\nevery age, as to look upon authorship as degrading, all knowledge, save\r\nLatin and Greek, as 'a bore,' and all entertainment but hunting,\r\nshooting, fishing, and badger-drawing, as unworthy of a man. In the last\r\ncentury these young animals, who unite the modesty of the puppy with the\r\nclear-sightedness of the pig, not to mention the progressiveness of\r\nanother quadruped, were more numerous than in the present day, and in\r\nconsequence more forward in their remarks. It was one of these charming\r\nyouths, who was staying in the same house as Sheridan, and who, quite\r\nunprovoked, began at dinner to talk of 'actors and authors, and those\r\nlow sort of people, you know.' Sheridan said nought, but patiently bided\r\nhis time. The next day there was a large dinner-party, and Sheridan and\r\nthe youth happened to sit opposite to one another in the most\r\nconspicuous part of the table. Young Nimrod was kindly obliging his side\r\nof the table with extraordinary leaps of his hunter, the perfect working\r\nof his new double-barrelled Manton, &c., bringing of course number one\r\nin as the hero in each case. In a moment of silence, Sheridan, with an\r\nair of great politeness, addressed his unhappy victim. 'He had not,' he\r\nsaid, 'been able to catch the whole of the very interesting account he\r\nhad heard Mr. ---- relating.' All eyes were turned upon the two. 'Would\r\nMr. ---- permit him to ask who it was who made the extraordinary leap he\r\nhad mentioned?--'I, sir,' replied the youth with some pride. 'Then who\r\nwas it killed the wild duck at that distance?'--'I, sir.' 'Was it your\r\nsetter who behaved so well?'--'Yes, mine, sir,' replied the youth,\r\ngetting rather red over this examination. 'And who caught the huge\r\nsalmon so neatly?'--'I, sir.' And so the questioning went on through a\r\ndozen more items, till the young man, weary of answering 'I, sir,' and\r\ngrowing redder and redder every moment, would gladly have hid his head\r\nunder the table-cloth, in spite of his sporting prowess. But Sheridan\r\nhad to give him the _coup de grace_.\r\n\r\n'So, sir,' said he, very politely, 'you were the chief _actor_ in every\r\nanecdote, and the _author_ of them all; surely it is impolitic to\r\ndespise your own professions.'\r\n\r\nSheridan's intemperance was as great and as incurable as his\r\nextravagance, and we think his mind, if not his body, lived only on\r\nstimulants. He could neither write nor speak without them One day,\r\nbefore one of his finest speeches in the House, he was seen to enter a\r\ncoffee-house, call for a pint of brandy, and swallow it 'neat,' and\r\nalmost at one gulp. His friends occasionally interfered. This drinking,\r\nthey told him, would destroy the coat of his stomach. 'Then my stomach\r\nmust digest in its waistcoat,' laughed Sheridan.\r\n\r\nWhere are the topers of yore? Jovial I will not call them, for every one\r\nknows that\r\n\r\n  'Mirth and laughter.'\r\n\r\nworked up with a corkscrew, are followed by\r\n\r\n  'Headaches and hot coppers the day after.'\r\n\r\nBut where are those Anakim of the bottle, who _could_ floor their two of\r\nport and one of Madeira, though the said two and one floored them in\r\nturn? The race, I believe, has died out. Our heads have got weaker, as\r\nour cellars grew emptier. The arrangement was convenient. The daughters\r\nof Eve have nobly undertaken to atone for the naughty conduct of their\r\nprimeval mamma, by reclaiming men, and dragging them from the Hades of\r\nthe mahogany to that seventh heaven of muffins and English ballads\r\nprepared for them in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nWe are certainly astounded, even to incredulity, when we read of the\r\ndeeds of a David or a Samson; but such wonderment can be nothing\r\ncompared to that which a generation or two hence will feel, when\r\nsipping, as a great extravagance and unpardonable luxury, two\r\nthimblefuls of 'African Sherry,' the young demirep of the day reads that\r\nthree English gentlemen, Sheridan, Richardson, and Ward, sat down one\r\nday to dinner, and before they rose again--if they ever rose, which\r\nseems doubtful--or, at least, were raised, had emptied five bottles of\r\nport, two of Madeira, and one of brandy! Yet this was but one instance\r\nin a thousand; there was nothing extraordinary in it, and it is only\r\nmentioned because the amount drunk is accurately given by the unhappy\r\nowner of the wine, Kelly, the composer, who, unfortunately, or\r\nfortunately, was not present, and did not even imagine that the three\r\nhonourable gentlemen were discussing his little store. Yet Sheridan does\r\nnot seem to have believed much in his friend's vintages, for he advised\r\nhim to alter his brass plate to 'Michael Kelly, Composer of Wine and\r\nImporter of Music.' He made a better joke, when, dining with Lord\r\nThurlow, he tried in vain to induce him to produce a second bottle of\r\nsome extremely choice Constantia from the Cape of Good Hope. 'Ah,' he\r\nmuttered to his neighbour, 'pass me that decanter, if you please, for I\r\nmust return to Madeira, as I see I cannot _double the Cape_'\r\n\r\nBut as long as Richard Brinsley was a leader of political and\r\nfashionable circles, as long as he had a position to keep up, an\r\nambition to satisfy, a labour to complete, his drinking was, if not\r\nmoderate, not extraordinary for his time and his associates. But when a\r\nman's ambition is limited to mere success--when fame and a flash for\r\nhimself are all he cares for, and there is no truer, grander motive for\r\nhis sustaining the position he has climbed to--when, in short, it is his\r\nown glory, not mankind's good, he has ever striven for--woe, woe, woe\r\nwhen the hour of success is come! I cannot stop to name and examine\r\ninstances, but let me be allowed to refer to that bugbear who is called\r\nup whenever greatness of any kind has to be illustrated--Napoleon the\r\nGreat; or let me take any of the lesser Napoleons in lesser grades in\r\nany nation, any age--the men who have had no star but self and\r\nself-glory before them--and let me ask if any one can be named who, if\r\nhe has survived the attainment of his ambition, has not gone down the\r\nother side of the hill somewhat faster than he came up it? Then let me\r\nselect men whose guiding-star has been the good of their\r\nfellow-creatures, or the glory of God, and watch their peaceful useful\r\nend on that calm summit that they toiled so honestly to reach. The\r\ndifference comes home to us. The moral is read only at the end of the\r\nstory. Remorse rings it for ever in the ears of the dying--often too\r\nlong a-dying--man who has laboured for himself. Peace reads it smilingly\r\nto him whose generous toil for others has brought its own reward.\r\n\r\nSheridan had climbed with the stride of a giant, laughing at rocks, at\r\nprecipices, at slippery watercourses. He had spread the wings of genius\r\nto poise himself withal, and gained one peak after another, while\r\nhomelier worth was struggling midway, clutching the bramble and clinging\r\nto the ferns. He had, as Byron said in Sheridan's days of decay, done\r\nthe best in all he undertook, written the best comedy, best opera, best\r\nfarce; spoken the best parody, and made the best speech. Sheridan, when\r\nthose words of the young poet were told him, shed tears.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the bitter thought struck him, that he had _not_ led the best,\r\nbut the _worst_ life; that comedy, farce, opera, monody, and oration\r\nwere nothing, nothing to a pure conscience and a peaceful old age; that\r\nthey could not save him from shame and poverty--from debt, disgrace,\r\ndrunkenness--from grasping, but long-cheated creditors, who dragged his\r\nbed from under the feeble, nervous, ruined old man. Poor Sheridan! his\r\nend was too bitter for us to cast one stone more upon him. Let it be\r\nnoted that it was in the beginning of his decline, when, having reached\r\nthe climax of all his ambition and completed his fame as a dramatist,\r\norator, and wit, that the hand of Providence mercifully interposed to\r\nrescue this reckless man from his downfall. It smote him with that\r\ncommon but powerful weapon--death. Those he best loved were torn from\r\nhim, one after another, rapidly, and with little warning. The Linleys,\r\nthe 'nest of nightingales,' were all delicate as nightingales should be;\r\nand it seemed as if this very time was chosen for their deaths, that the\r\none erring soul--more precious, remember, than many just lives--might be\r\ncalled back. Almost within one year he lost his dear sister-in-law, the\r\nwife of his most intimate friend Tickell; Maria Linley, the last of the\r\nfamily; his own wife, and his little daughter. One grief succeeded\r\nanother so rapidly that Sheridan was utterly unnerved, utterly brought\r\nlow by them; but it was his wife's death that told most upon him. With\r\nthat wife he had always been the lover rather than the husband. She had\r\nmarried him in the days of his poverty, when her beauty was so\r\ncelebrated that she might have wed whom she would. She had risen with\r\nhim and shared his later anxieties. Yet she had seen him forget, neglect\r\nher, and seek other society. In spite of his tender affection for her\r\nand for his children, he had never made a _home_ of their home. Vanity\r\nFair had kept him ever flitting, and it is little to be wondered at that\r\nMrs. Sheridan was the object of much, though ever respectful\r\nadmiration.[9] Yet, in spite of calumny, she died with a fair fame.\r\nDecline had long pressed upon her, yet her last illness was too brief.\r\nIn 1792 she was taken away, still in the summer of her days, and with\r\nher last breath uttering her love for the man who had never duly prized\r\nher. His grief was terrible; yet it passed, and wrought no change. He\r\nfound solace in his beloved son, and yet more beloved daughter. A few\r\nmonths--and the little girl followed her mother. Again his grief was\r\nterrible: again passed and wrought no change. Yes, it did work some\r\nchange, but not for the better; it drove him to the goblet; and from\r\nthat time we may date the confirmation of his habit of drinking. The\r\nsolemn warnings had been unheeded: they were to be repeated by a\r\nlong-suffering God in a yet more solemn manner, which should touch him\r\nyet more nearly. His beautiful wife had been the one restraint upon his\r\nfolly and his lavishness. Now she was gone, they burst out afresh,\r\nwilder than ever.\r\n\r\n[9: Lord Edward Fitzgerald was one of the most devoted of her admirers:\r\nhe chose his wife, Pamela, because she resembled Mrs. Sheridan.--See\r\nMoore's Life of Lord Edward.]\r\n\r\nFor a while after these afflictions, which were soon completed in the\r\ndeath of his most intimate friend and boyish companion, Tickell,\r\nSheridan threw himself again into the commotion of the political world.\r\nBut in this we shall not follow him. Three years after the death of his\r\nfirst wife he married again. He was again fortunate in his choice.\r\nThough now forty-four, he succeeded in winning the heart of a most\r\nestimable and charming young lady with a fortune of £5,000. She must\r\nindeed have loved or admired the widower very much to consent to be the\r\nwife of a man so notoriously irregular, to use a mild term, in his life.\r\nBut Sheridan fascinated wherever he went, and young ladies like 'a\r\nlittle wildness.' His heart was always good, and where he gave it, he\r\ngave it warmly, richly, fully. His second wife was Miss Esther Jane\r\nOgle, daughter of the Dean of Winchester. She was given to him on\r\ncondition of his settling in all £20,000, upon her--a wise proviso with\r\nsuch a spendthrift--and he had to raise the money, as usual.\r\n\r\nHis political career was sufficiently brilliant, though his real fame as\r\na speaker rests on his great oration at Hastings' trial. In 1806 he\r\nsatisfied another point of his ambition, long desired, and was elected\r\nfor the city of Westminster, which he had ardently coveted when Fox\r\nrepresented it. But a dissolution threw him again on the mercy of the\r\npopular party; and again he offered himself for Westminster: but, in\r\nspite of all the efforts made for him, without success. He was returned,\r\ninstead, for Ilchester.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his difficulties increased; extravagance, debt, want of energy\r\nto meet both, brought him speedily into that position when a man accepts\r\nwithout hesitation the slightest offer of aid. The man who had had an\r\nincome of £15,000 a year, and settled £20,000 on his wife, allowed a\r\npoor friend to pay a bill for £5 for him, and clutched eagerly at a £50\r\nnote when displayed to him by another. Extravagance is the father of\r\nmeanness, and Sheridan was often mean in the readiness with which he\r\naccepted offers, and the anxiety with which he implored assistance. It\r\nis amusing in the present day to hear a man talk of 'a debt of honour,'\r\nas if all debts did not demand honour to pay them--as if all debts\r\nincurred without hope of repayment were not dishonourable. A story is\r\ntold relative to the old-fashioned idea of a 'debt of honour.' A\r\ntradesman, to whom he had given a bill for £200, called on him for the\r\namount. A heap of gold was lying on the table. 'Don't look that way,'\r\ncried Sheridan, after protesting that he had not a penny in the world,\r\n'that is to pay a debt of honour.' The applicant, with some wit, tore up\r\nthe bill he held. 'Now, Mr. Sheridan,' quoth he, 'mine is a debt of\r\nhonour too.' It is to be hoped that Sheridan handed him the money.\r\n\r\nThe story of Gunter's bill is not so much to his credit, Hanson, an\r\nironmonger, called upon him and pressed for payment. A bill sent in by\r\nthe famous confectioner was lying on the table. A thought struck the\r\ndebtor, who had no means of getting rid of his importunate applicant.\r\n'You know Gunter?' he asked. 'One of the safest men in London,' replied\r\nthe ironmonger. 'Then will you be satisfied if I give you his _bill_ for\r\nthe amount?'--'Certainly.' Thereupon Sheridan handed him the neatly\r\nfolded account and rushed from the room, leaving the creditor to\r\ndiscover the point of Mr. Sheridan's little fun.\r\n\r\nStill Sheridan might have weathered through the storm. Drury Lane was a\r\nmine of wealth to him, and with a little care might have been really\r\nprofitable. The lawsuits, the debts, the engagements upon it, all rose\r\nfrom his negligence and extravagance. But Old Drury was doomed. On the\r\n24th February, 1809, soon after the conclusion of the performances, it\r\nwas announced to be in flames. Rather it announced itself. In a few\r\nmoments it was blazing--a royal bonfire. Sheridan was in the House of\r\nCommons at the time. The reddened clouds above London threw the glare\r\nback even to the windows of the House. The members rushed from their\r\nseats to see the unwonted light, and in consideration for Sheridan, an\r\nadjournment was moved. But he rose calmly, though sadly, and begged that\r\nno misfortune of his should interrupt the public business. His\r\nindependence, he said--witty in the midst of his troubles--had often\r\nbeen questioned, but was now confirmed, for he had nothing more to\r\ndepend upon. He then left the House, and repaired to the scene of\r\nconflagration.\r\n\r\nNot long after, Kelly found him sitting quite composed in 'The Bedford,'\r\nsipping his wine, as if nothing had happened. The musician expressed his\r\nastonishment at Mr. Sheridan's _sang froid_. 'Surely,' replied the wit,\r\n'you'll admit that a man has a right to take his wine by his own\r\nfireside.' But Sheridan was only drowning care, not disregarding it. The\r\nevent was really too much for him, though perhaps he did not realize the\r\nextent of its effect at the time. In a word, all he had in the world\r\nwent with the theatre. Nothing was left either for him or the principal\r\nshareholders. Yet he bore it all with fortitude, till he heard that the\r\nharpsichord, on which his first wife was wont to play, was gone too.\r\nThen he burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThis fire was the opening of the shaft down which the great man sank\r\nrapidly. While his fortunes kept up, his spirits were not completely\r\nexhausted. He drank much, but as an indulgence rather than as a relief.\r\nNow it was by wine alone that he could even raise himself to the common\r\nrequirements of conversation. He is described, _before_ dinner, as\r\ndepressed, nervous, and dull; _after_ dinner only did the old fire break\r\nout, the old wit blaze up, and Dick Sheridan was Dick Sheridan once\r\nmore. He was, in fact, fearfully oppressed by the long-accumulated and\r\nnever-to-be-wiped-off debts, for which he was now daily pressed. In\r\nquitting Parliament he resigned his sanctuary, and left himself an easy\r\nprey to the Jews and Gentiles, whom he had so long dodged and deluded\r\nwith his ready ingenuity. Drury Lane, as we all know, was rebuilt, and\r\nthe birth of the new house heralded with a prologue by Byron, about as\r\ngood as the one in 'Rejected Addresses,' the cleverest parodies ever\r\nwritten, and suggested by this very occasion. The building-committee\r\nhaving advertised for a prize prologue Samuel Whitbread sent in his own\r\nattempt, in which, as probably in a hundred others, the new theatre was\r\ncompared to a Phoenix rising out of the ashes of the old one. Sheridan\r\nsaid Whitbread's description of a Phoenix was excellent, for it was\r\nquite a _poulterer's description_.\r\n\r\nThis same Sam Whitbread was now to figure conspicuously in the life of\r\nMr. Richard B. Sheridan. The ex-proprietor was found to have an interest\r\nin the theatre to the amount of £150,000--not a trifle to be despised;\r\nbut he was now past sixty, and it need excite no astonishment that, even\r\nwith all his liabilities, he was unwilling to begin again the cares of\r\nmanagement, or mismanagement which he had endured so many years. He sold\r\nhis interest, in which his son Tom was joined, for £60,000. This sum\r\nwould have cleared off his debts and left him a balance sufficient to\r\nsecure comfort for his old age. But it was out of the question that any\r\nmoney matters should go right with Dick Sheridan. Of the rights and\r\nwrongs of the quarrel between him and Whitbread, who was the chairman of\r\nthe committee for building the new theatre, I do not pretend to form an\r\nopinion. Sheridan was not naturally mean, though he descended to\r\nmeanness when hard pressed--what man of his stamp does not? Whitbread\r\nwas truly friendly to him for a time. Sheridan was always complaining\r\nthat he was sued for debts he did not owe, and kept out of many that\r\nwere due to him. Whitbread knew his man well, and if he withheld what\r\nwas owing to him, may be excused on the ground of real friendship. All I\r\nknow is, that Sheridan and Whitbread quarrelled; that the former did\r\nnot, or affirmed that he did not, receive the full amount of his claim\r\non the property, and that, when what he had received was paid over to\r\nhis principal creditors, there was little or nothing left for my lord to\r\nspend in banquets to parliamentary friends and jorums of brandy in small\r\ncoffee-houses.\r\n\r\nBecause a man is a genius, he is not of necessity an upright, honest,\r\nill-used, oppressed, and cruelly-entreated man. Genius plays the fool\r\nwittingly, and often enough quite knowingly, with its own interests. It\r\nis its privilege to do so, and no one has a right to complain. But then\r\nGenius ought to hold its tongue, and not make itself out a martyr, when\r\nit has had the dubious glory of defying common-sense. If Genius despises\r\ngold, well and good, but when he has spurned it, he should not whine out\r\nthat he is wrongfully kept from it. Poor Sheridan may or may not have\r\nbeen right in the Whitbread quarrel; he has had his defenders, and I am\r\nnot ambitious of being numbered among them; but whatever were now his\r\ntroubles were brought on by his own disregard of all that was right and\r\nbeautiful in conduct. If he went down to the grave a pauper and a\r\ndebtor, he had made his own bed, and in it he was to lie.\r\n\r\nLie he did, wretchedly, on the most unhappy bed that old age ever lay\r\nin. There is little more of importance to chronicle of his latter days.\r\nThe retribution came on slowly but terribly. The career of a ruined man\r\nis not a pleasant topic to dwell upon, and I leave Sheridan's misery for\r\nMr. J. B. Gough to whine and roar over when he wants a shocking example.\r\nSheridan might have earned many a crown in that capacity, if\r\ntemperance-oratory had been the passion of the day. Debt, disease,\r\ndepravity--these words describe enough the downward career of his old\r\nage. To eat, still more to drink, was now the troublesome enigma of the\r\nquondam genius. I say quondam, for all the marks of that genius were now\r\ngone. One after another his choicest properties made their way to 'my\r\nuncle's.' The books went first, as if they could be most easily\r\ndispensed with; the remnants of his plate followed; then his pictures\r\nwere sold; and at last even the portrait of his first wife, by Reynolds,\r\nwas left in pledge for a 'further remittance.'\r\n\r\nThe last humiliation arrived in time, and the associate of a prince, the\r\neloquent organ of a party, the man who had enjoyed £15,000, a year, was\r\ncarried off to a low sponging-house. His pride forsook him in that\r\ndismal and disgusting imprisonment, and he wrote to Whitbread a letter\r\nwhich his defenders ought not to have published. He had his\r\nfriends--stanch ones too--and they aided him. Peter Moore, ironmonger,\r\nand even Canning, lent him money and released him from time to time. For\r\nsix years after the burning of the old theatre, he continued to go down\r\nand down. Disease now attacked him fiercely. In the spring of 1816 he\r\nwas fast waning towards extinction. His day was past; he had outlived\r\nhis fame as a wit and social light; he was forgotten by many, if not by\r\nmost, of his old associates. He wrote to Rogers, 'I am absolutely undone\r\nand broken-hearted.' Poor Sheridan! in spite of all thy faults, who is\r\nhe whose morality is so stern that he cannot shed one tear over thy\r\nlatter days! God forgive us, we are all sinners; and if we weep not for\r\nthis man's deficiency, how shall we ask tears when our day comes? Even\r\nas I write, I feel my hand tremble and my eyes moisten over the sad end\r\nof one whom I love, though he died before I was born. 'They are going to\r\nput the carpets out of window,' he wrote to Rogers, 'and break into Mrs.\r\nS.'s room and _take me_. For God's sake let me see you!' See him!--see\r\none friend who could and would help him in his misery! Oh! happy may\r\nthat man count himself who has never wanted that one friend, and felt\r\nthe utter helplessness of that want! Poor Sheridan! had he ever asked,\r\nor hoped, or looked for that Friend out of _this_ world it had been\r\nbetter; for 'the Lord thy God is a jealous God,' and we go on seeking\r\nhuman friendship and neglecting the divine till it is too late. He found\r\none hearty friend in his physician, Dr. Bain, when all others had\r\nforsaken him. The spirit of White's and Brookes', the companion of a\r\nprince and a score of noblemen, the enlivener of every 'fashionable'\r\ntable, was forgotten by all but this one doctor. Let us read Moore's\r\ndescription: 'A sheriff's officer at length arrested the dying man _in\r\nhis bed_, and was about to carry him off, in his blankets, to a\r\nsponging-house, when Dr. Bain interfered.' Who would live the life of\r\nrevelry that Sheridan lived to have such an end? A few days after, on\r\nthe 7th of July, 1816, in his sixty-fifth year, he died. Of his last\r\nhours the late Professor Smythe wrote an admirable and most touching\r\naccount, a copy of which was circulated in manuscript. The Professor,\r\nhearing of Sheridan's condition, asked to see him, with a view, not only\r\nof alleviating present distress, but of calling the dying man to\r\nrepentance. From his hands the unhappy Sheridan received the Holy\r\nCommunion; his face, during that solemn rite,--doubly solemn when it is\r\nperformed in the chamber of death, 'expressed,' Smythe relates, '_the\r\ndeepest awe_' That phrase conveys to the mind impressions not easy to be\r\ndefined, not soon to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nPeace! there was not peace even in death, and the creditor pursued him\r\neven into the 'waste wide,'--even to the coffin. He was lying in state,\r\nwhen a gentleman in the deepest mourning called, it is said, at the\r\nhouse, and introducing himself as an old and much-attached friend of the\r\ndeceased, begged to be allowed to look upon his face. The tears which\r\nrose in his eyes, the tremulousness of his quiet voice, the pallor of\r\nhis mournful face, deceived the unsuspecting servant, who accompanied\r\nhim to the chamber of death, removed the lid of the coffin, turned down\r\nthe shrowd, and revealed features which had once been handsome, but long\r\nsince rendered almost hideous by drinking. The stranger gazed with\r\nprofound emotion, while he quietly drew from his pocket a bailiff's\r\nwand, and touching the corpse's face with it, suddenly altered his\r\nmanner to one of considerable glee, and informed the servant that he had\r\narrested the corpse in the king's name for a debt of £500. It was the\r\nmorning of the funeral, which was to be attended by half the grandees of\r\nEngland, and in a few minutes the mourners began to arrive. But the\r\ncorpse was the bailiff's property, till his claim was paid, and nought\r\nbut the money would soften the iron capturer. Canning and Lord Sidmouth\r\nagreed to settle the matter, and over the coffin the debt was paid.\r\n\r\nPoor corpse! was it worth £500--diseased, rotting as it was, and about\r\nto be given for nothing to mother earth? Was it worth the pomp of the\r\nsplendid funeral and the grand hypocrisy of grief with which it was\r\nborne to Westminster Abbey? Was not rather the wretched old man, while\r\nhe yet struggled on in life, worth this outlay, worth this show of\r\nsympathy? Folly; not folly only--but a lie! What recked the dead of the\r\nfour noble pall-bearers--the Duke of Bedford, the Earl of Lauderdale,\r\nEarl Mulgrave, and the Bishop of London? What good was it to him to be\r\nfollowed by two royal highnesses--the Dukes of York and Sussex--by two\r\nmarquises, seven earls, three viscounts, five lords, a Canning, a lord\r\nmayor, and a whole regiment of honourables and right honourables, who\r\nnow wore the livery of grief, when they had let him die in debt, in\r\nwant, and in misery? Far more, if the dead could feel, must he have been\r\ngrateful for the honester tears of those two untitled men, who had\r\nreally befriended him to the last hour and never abandoned him, Mr.\r\nRogers and Dr. Bain. But peace; let him pass with nodding plumes and\r\nwell-dyed horses to the great Walhalla, and amid the dust of many a poet\r\nlet the poet's dust find rest and honour, secure at last from the hand\r\nof the bailiff. There was but one nook unoccupied in Poet's Corner, and\r\nthere they laid him. A simple marble was afforded by another friend\r\nwithout a title--Peter Moore.\r\n\r\nTo a life like Sheridan's it is almost impossible to do justice in so\r\nnarrow a space as I have here. He is one of those men who, not to be\r\nmade out a whit better or worse than they are, demand a careful\r\ninvestigation of all their actions, or reported actions--a careful\r\nsifting of all the evidence for or against them, and a careful weeding\r\nof all the anecdotes told of them. This requires a separate biography.\r\nTo give a general idea of the man, we must be content to give that which\r\nhe inspired in a general acquaintance. Many of his 'mots,' and more of\r\nthe stories about him, may have been invented for him, but they would\r\nscarcely have been fixed on Sheridan, if they had not fitted more or\r\nless his character: I have therefore given them. I might have given a\r\nhundred more, but I have let alone those anecdotes which did not seem to\r\nillustrate the character of the man. Many another good story is told of\r\nhim, and we must content ourselves with one or two. Take one that is\r\ncharacteristic of his love of fun.\r\n\r\nSheridan is accosted by an elderly gentleman, who has forgotten the name\r\nof a street to which he wants to go, and who informs him precisely that\r\nit is an out-of-the-way name.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps, sir, you mean John Street?' says Sherry, all innocence.\r\n\r\n'No, an unusual name.'\r\n\r\n'It can't be Charles Street?'\r\n\r\nImpatience on the part of the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n'King Street?' suggests the cruel wit.\r\n\r\n'I tell you, sir, it is a street with a very odd name!'\r\n\r\n'Bless me, is it Queen Street?'\r\n\r\nIrritation on the part of the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n'It must be Oxford Street?' cries Sheridan as if inspired.\r\n\r\n'Sir, I repeat,' very testily, 'that it is a very odd name. Every one\r\nknows Oxford Street!'\r\n\r\nSheridan appears to be thinking.\r\n\r\n'An odd name! Oh! ah! just so; Piccadilly, of course?'\r\n\r\nOld gentleman bounces away in disgust.\r\n\r\n'Well, sir,' Sheridan calls after him, 'I envy you your admirable\r\nmemory!'\r\n\r\nHis wit was said to have been prepared, like his speeches, and he is\r\neven reported to have carried his book of _mots_ in his pocket, as a\r\nyoung lady of the middle class _might_, but seldom does, carry her book\r\nof etiquette into a party. But some of his wit was no doubt extempore.\r\n\r\nWhen arrested for non-attendance to a call in the House, soon after the\r\nchange of ministry, he exclaimed, 'How hard to be no sooner out of\r\noffice than into custody!'\r\n\r\nHe was not an inveterate talker, like Macaulay, Sydney Smith, or\r\nJeffrey: he seems rather to have aimed at a striking effect in all that\r\nhe said. When found tripping he had a clever knack of getting out of the\r\ndifficulty. In the Hastings speech he complimented Gibbon as a\r\n'luminous' writer; questioned on this, he replied archly, 'I said\r\n_vo_-luminous.'\r\n\r\nI cannot afford to be voluminous on Sheridan, and so I quit him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAU BRUMMELL\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo popular Sciences.--'Buck Brummell' at Eton.--Investing his Capital.--\r\nYoung Cornet Brummell.--The Beau's Studio.--The Toilet.--'Creasing\r\nDown.'--Devotion to Dress.--A Great Gentleman.--Anecdotes of Brummell.--\r\n'Don't forget, Brum: Goose at Four!'--Offers of Intimacy resented.--Never\r\nin love.--Brummell out Hunting.--Anecdote of Sheridan and Brummell.--The\r\nBeau's Poetical Efforts.--The Value of a Crooked Sixpence.--The Breach\r\nwith the Prince of Wales.--'Who's your Fat Friend?'--The Climax is\r\nreached.--The Black-mail of Calais.--George the Greater and George the\r\nLess.--An Extraordinary Step.--Down the Hill of Life.--A Miserable Old\r\nAge.--In the Hospice Du Bon Sauveur.--O Young Men of this Age, be warned!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing to what a number of insignificant things high art has\r\nbeen applied, and with what success. It is the vice of high civilization\r\nto look for it and reverence it, where a ruder age would only laugh at\r\nits employment. Crime and cookery, especially, have been raised into\r\nsciences of late, and the professors of both received the amount of\r\nhonour due to their acquirements. Who would be so naïve as to sneer at\r\nthe author of 'The Art of Dining?' or who so ungentlemanly as not to\r\npity the sorrows of a pious baronet, whose devotion to the noble art of\r\nappropriation was shamefully rewarded with accommodation gratis on board\r\none of Her Majesty's transport-ships? The disciples of Ude have left us\r\nthe literary results of their studies, and one at least, the graceful\r\nAlexis Soyer, is numbered among our public benefactors. We have little\r\ndoubt that as the art, vulgarly called 'embezzlement,' becomes more and\r\nmore fashionable, as it does every day, we shall have a work on the 'Art\r\nof Appropriation.' It is a pity that Brummell looked down upon\r\nliterature: poor literature! it had a hard struggle to recover the\r\nslight, for we are convinced there is not a work more wanted than the\r\n'Art of Dressing,' and 'George the Less' was almost the last professor\r\nof that elaborate science.\r\n\r\nIf the maxim, that 'whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well,'\r\nhold good, Beau Brummell must be regarded in the light of a great man.\r\nThat dressing is worth doing at all, everybody but a Fiji Islander seems\r\nto admit, for everybody does it. If, then, a man succeeds in dressing\r\nbetter than anybody else, it follows that he is entitled to the most\r\nuniversal admiration.\r\n\r\nBut there was another object to which this great man condescended to\r\napply the principles of high art--I mean affectation. How admirably he\r\nsucceeded in this his life will show. But can we doubt that he is\r\nentitled to our greatest esteem and heartiest gratitude for the studies\r\nhe pursued with unremitting patience in these two useful branches, when\r\nwe find that a prince of the blood delighted to honour, and the richest,\r\nnoblest, and most distinguished men of half a century ago were proud to\r\nknow him? We are writing, then, of no common man, no mere beau, but of\r\nthe greatest professor of two of the most popular sciences--Dress and\r\nAffectation. Let us speak with reverence of this wonderful genius.\r\n\r\nGeorge Brummell was 'a self-made man.' That is, all that nature, the\r\ntailors, stags, and padding had not made of him, he made for\r\nhimself--his name, his fame, his fortune, and his friends--and all these\r\nwere great. The author of 'Self-help' has most unaccountably omitted all\r\nmention of him, and most erroneously, for if there ever was a man who\r\nhelped himself, and no one else, it was, 'very sincerely yours, George\r\nBrummell.'\r\n\r\nThe founder of the noble house of Brummell, the grandfather of our hero,\r\nwas either a treasury porter, or a confectioner, or something else.[10]\r\nAt any rate he let lodgings in Bury Street, and whether from the fact\r\nthat his wife did not purloin her lodgers' tea and sugar, or from some\r\nother cause, he managed to ingratiate himself with one of them--who\r\nafterwards became Lord Liverpool--so thoroughly, that through his\r\ninfluence he obtained for his son the post of Private Secretary to Lord\r\nNorth. Nothing could have been more fortunate, except, perhaps, the\r\nson's next move, which was to take in marriage the daughter of\r\nRichardson, the owner of a well-known lottery-office. Between the\r\nlottery of office and the lottery of love, Brummell _père_ managed to\r\nmake a very good fortune. At his death he left as much as £65,000 to be\r\ndivided among his three children--Raikes says as much as £30,000\r\na-piece--so that the Beau, if not a fool, ought never to have been a\r\npauper.\r\n\r\n[10: Mr. Jesse says that the Beau's grandfather was a servant of Mr.\r\nCharles Monson, brother to the first Lord Monson.]\r\n\r\nGeorge Bryan Brummell, the second son of this worthy man, honoured by\r\nhis birth the 7th of June, 1778. No anecdotes of his childhood are\r\npreserved, except that he once cried because he could not eat any more\r\ndamson tart. In later years he would probably have thought damson tart\r\n'very vulgar.' He first turns up at Eton at the age of twelve, and even\r\nthere commences his distinguished career, and is known as 'Buck\r\nBrummell.' The boy showed himself decidedly father to the man here.\r\nMaster George was not vulgar enough, nor so imprudent, it may be added,\r\nas to fight, row, or play cricket, but he distinguished himself by the\r\nintroduction of a gold buckle in the white stock, by never being\r\nflogged, and by his ability in toasting cheese. We do not hear much of\r\nhis classical attainments.\r\n\r\nThe very gentlemanly youth was in due time passed on to Oriel College,\r\nOxford. Here he distinguished himself by a studied indifference to\r\ncollege discipline and an equal dislike to studies. He condescended to\r\ntry for the Newdigate Prize poem, but his genius leaned far more to the\r\nturn of a coat-collar than that of a verse, and, unhappily for the\r\nBritish poets, their ranks were not to be dignified by the addition of\r\nthis illustrious man. The Newdigate was given to another; and so, to\r\npunish Oxford, the competitor left it and poetry together, after having\r\nadorned the old quadrangle of Oriel for less than a year.\r\n\r\nHe was now a boy of seventeen, and a very fine boy, too. To judge from a\r\nportrait taken in later life, he was not strictly handsome; but he is\r\ndescribed as tall, well built, and of a slight and graceful figure.\r\nAdded to this, he had got from Eton and Oxford, if not much learning,\r\nmany a well-born friend, and he was toady enough to cultivate those of\r\nbetter, and to dismiss those of less distinction. He was, through life,\r\na celebrated 'cutter,' and Brummell's cut was as much admired--by all\r\nbut the _cuttee_--as Brummel's coat. Then he had some £25,000 as capital\r\nand how could he best invest it? He consulted no stockbroker on this\r\nweighty point; he did not even buy a shilling book of advice such as we\r\nhave seen advertised for those who do not know what to do with their\r\nmoney. The question was answered in a moment by the young worldling of\r\nsixteen: he would enter a crack regiment and invest his guineas in the\r\nthousand per cents. of fashionable life.\r\n\r\nHis namesake, the Regent, was now thirty-two, and had spent those years\r\nof his life in acquiring the honorary title of the 'first gentleman of\r\nEurope' by every act of folly, debauch, dissipation, and degradation\r\nwhich a prince can conveniently perpetrate. He was the hero of London\r\nsociety, which adored and backbit him alternately, and he was precisely\r\nthe man whom the boy Brummell would worship. The Regent was colonel of a\r\nfamous regiment of fops--the 10th Hussars. It was the most expensive,\r\nthe most impertinent, the best-dressed, the worst-moralled regiment in\r\nthe British army. Its officers, many of them titled, all more or less\r\ndistinguished in the trying campaigns of London seasons, were the\r\nintimates of the Prince-Colonel. Brummell aspired to a cornetcy in this\r\nbrilliant regiment, and obtained it; nor that alone; he secured, by his\r\nmanners, o his dress, or his impudence, the favour and companionship--\r\nfriendship we cannot say--of the prince who commanded it.\r\n\r\nBy this step his reputation was made, and it was only necessary to keep\r\nit up. He had an immense fund of good nature, and, as long as his money\r\nlasted, of good spirits, too. Good sayings--that is, witty if not wise--\r\nare recorded of him, and his friends pronounce him a charming companion.\r\nIntroduced, therefore, into the highest circles in England, he could\r\nscarcely fail to succeed. Young Cornet Brummell became a great favourite\r\nwith the fair.\r\n\r\nHis rise in the regiment was of course rapid: in three years he was at\r\nthe head of a troop. The onerous duties of a military life, which\r\nvacillated between Brighton and London, and consisted chiefly in making\r\noneself agreeable in the mess-room, were too much for our hero. He\r\nneglected parade, or arrived too late: it was such a bore to have to\r\ndress in a hurry. It is said that he knew the troop he commanded only by\r\nthe peculiar nose of one of the men, and that when a transfer of men had\r\nonce been made, rode up to the wrong troop, and supported his mistake by\r\npointing to the nose in question. No fault, however, was found with the\r\nRegent's favourite, and Brummell might have risen to any rank if he\r\ncould have supported the terrific labour of dressing for parade. Then,\r\ntoo, there came wars and rumours of wars, and our gallant captain\r\nshuddered at the vulgarity of shedding blood: the supply of\r\nsmelling-salts would never have been liberal enough to keep him from\r\nfainting on the battle-field. It is said, too, that the regiment was\r\nordered to Manchester. Could anything be more gross or more ill-bred?\r\nThe idea of figuring before the wives and daughters of cotton-spinners\r\nwas too fearful; and from one cause or another our brave young captain\r\ndetermined to retire, which he did in 1798.\r\n\r\nIt was now, therefore, that he commenced the profession of a beau, and\r\nas he is the Prince of Beaux, as his patron was the Beau of Princes, and\r\nas his fame has spread to France and Germany, if only as the inventor of\r\nthe trouser; and as there is no man who on getting up in the morning\r\ndoes not put on his clothes with more or less reflection as to whether\r\nthey are the right ones to put on, and as beaux have existed since the\r\ndays of the emperor of beaux, Alexander the Macedonian, and will\r\nprobably exist to all time, let us rejoice in the high honour of being\r\npermitted to describe how this illustrious genius clothed his poor\r\nflesh, and made the most of what God had given him--a body and legs.\r\n\r\nThe private life of Brummell would in itself serve as a book of manners\r\nand habits. The two were his profoundest study; but, alas! his impudence\r\nmarred the former, and the latter can scarcely be imitated in the\r\npresent day. Still as a great example he is yet invaluable, and must be\r\ndescribed in all detail.\r\n\r\nHis morning toilette was a most elaborate affair. Never was Brummell\r\nguilty of _déshabille_. Like a true man of business, he devoted the best\r\nand earliest hours--and many of them too--to his profession, namely--\r\ndressing. His dressing-room was a studio, in which he daily prepared\r\nthat elaborate portrait of George Brummell which was to be exhibited for\r\na few hours in the club-rooms and drawing-rooms of town, only to be\r\ntaken to pieces again, and again made up for the evening. Charles I.\r\ndelighted to resort of a morning to the studio of Vandyck, and to watch\r\nhis favourite artist's progress. The Regent George was no less devoted\r\nto art, for we are assured by Mr. Raikes that he often visited his\r\nfavourite beau in the morning to watch his toilet, and would sometimes\r\nstay so late that he would send his horses away, insisting on Brummell\r\ngiving him a quiet dinner, 'which generally ended in a deep potation.'\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, many fabulous myths floating about concerning this\r\nillustrious man; and his biographer, Captain Jesse, seems anxious to\r\ndefend him from the absurd stories of French writers, who asserted that\r\nhe employed two glovers to covers his hands, to one of whom were\r\nintrusted the thumbs, to the other the fingers and hand, and three\r\nbarbers to dress his hair, while his boots were polished with champagne,\r\nhis cravats designed by a celebrated portrait painter, and so forth.\r\nThese may be pleasant inventions, but Captain Jesse's own account of his\r\ntoilet, even when the Beau was broken, and living in elegant poverty\r\nabroad, is quite absurd enough to render excusable the ingenious\r\nexaggerations of the foreign writer.\r\n\r\nThe _batterie de toilette_, we are told, was of silver, and included a\r\nspitting-dish, for its owner said 'he could not spit into clay.'\r\nNapoleon shaved himself, but Brummell was not quite great enough to do\r\nthat, just as my Lord So-and-so walks to church on Sunday, while his\r\nneighbour, the Birmingham millionaire, can only arrive there in a\r\nchariot and pair.\r\n\r\nHis ablutions took no less than two whole hours! What knowledge might\r\nhave been gained, what good done in the time he devoted to rubbing his\r\nlovely person with a hair-glove! Cleanliness was, in fact, Brummell's\r\nreligion; perhaps because it is generally set down as 'next to\r\ngodliness,' a proximity with which the Beau was quite satisfied, for he\r\nnever attempted to pass on to that next stage. Poor fool, he might rub\r\nevery particle of moisture off the skin of his body--he might be clean\r\nas a kitten--but he could not and did not purify his mind with all this\r\nfriction; and the man who would have fainted to see a black speck upon\r\nhis shirt, was not at all shocked at the indecent conversation in which\r\nhe and his companions occasionally indulged.\r\n\r\nThe body cleansed, the face had next to be brought up as near perfection\r\nas nature would allow. With a small looking-glass in one hand, and\r\ntweezers in the other, he carefully removed the tiniest hairs that he\r\ncould discover on his cheeks or chin, enduring the pain like a martyr.\r\n\r\nThen came the shirt, which was in his palmy days changed three times a\r\nday, and then in due course the great business of the cravat. Captain\r\nJesse's minute account of the process of tying this can surely be relied\r\non, and presents one of the most ludicrous pictures of folly and vanity\r\nthat can be imagined. Had Brummell never lived, and a novelist or\r\nplay-writer described the toilet which Captain Jesse affirms to have\r\nbeen his daily achievement, he would have had the critics about him with\r\nthe now common phrase--'This book is a tissue, not only of\r\nimprobabilities, but of actual impossibilities.' The collar, then, was\r\nso large, that in its natural condition it rose high above the wearer's\r\nhead, and some ingenuity was required to reduce it by delicate folds to\r\nexactly that height which the Beau judged to be correct. Then came the\r\nall-majestic white neck-tie, a foot in breadth. It is not to be supposed\r\nthat Brummell had the neck of a swan or a camel--far from it. The worthy\r\nfool had now to undergo, with admirable patience, the mysterious process\r\nknown to our papas as 'creasing down.' The head was thrown back, as if\r\nready for a dentist; the stiff white tie applied to the throat, and\r\ngradually wrinkled into half its actual breadth by the slow downward\r\nmovement of the chin. When all was done, we can imagine that comfort was\r\nsacrificed to elegance, as it was then considered, and that the sudden\r\nappearance of Venus herself could not have induced the deluded\r\nindividual to turn his head in a hurry.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely profitable to follow this lesser deity into all the\r\ndetails of his self-adornment. It must suffice to say that he affected\r\nan extreme neatness and simplicity of dress, every item of which was\r\nstudied and discussed for many an hour. In the mornings he was still\r\nguilty of hessians and pantaloons, or 'tops' and buckskins, with a blue\r\ncoat and buff waistcoat. The costume is not so ancient, but that one may\r\ntumble now and then on a country squire who glories in it and denounces\r\nus juveniles as 'bears' for want of a similar precision. Poor Brummell,\r\nhe cordially hated the country squires, and would have wanted rouge for\r\na week if he could have dreamed that his pet attire would, some fifty\r\nyears later, be represented only by one of that class which he was so\r\nanxious to exclude from Watier's.\r\n\r\nBut it was in the evening that he displayed his happy invention of the\r\ntrouser, or rather its introduction from Germany. This article he wore\r\nvery tight to the leg, and buttoned over the ankle, exactly as we see it\r\nin old prints of 'the fashion.' Then came the wig, and on that the hat.\r\nIt is a vain and thankless task to defend Brummell from the charge of\r\nbeing a dandy. If one proof of his devotion to dress were wanted, it\r\nwould be the fact that this hat, once stuck jauntily on one side of the\r\nwig, was never removed in the street even to salute a lady--so that,\r\ninasmuch as he sacrificed his manners to his appearance, he may be\r\nfairly set down as a fop.\r\n\r\nThe perfect artist could not be expected to be charitable to the less\r\nsuccessful. Dukes and princes consulted him on the make of their coats,\r\nand discussed tailors with him with as much solemnity as divines might\r\ndispute on a mystery of religion. Brummell did not spare them.\r\n'Bedford,' said he, to the duke of that name, fingering a new garment\r\nwhich his grace had submitted to his inspection, 'do you call this\r\n_thing_ a coat?' Again, meeting a noble acquaintance who wore shoes in\r\nthe morning, he stopped and asked him what he had got upon his feet.\r\n'Oh! shoes are they,' quoth he, with a well bred sneer, 'I thought they\r\nwere slippers.' He was even ashamed of his own brother, and when the\r\nlatter came to town, begged him to keep to the back streets till his new\r\nclothes were sent home. Well might his friend the Regent say, that he\r\nwas 'a mere tailor's dummy to hang clothes upon.'\r\n\r\nBut in reality Brummell was more. He had some sharpness and some taste.\r\nBut the former was all brought out in sneers, and the latter in\r\nsnuff-boxes. His whole mind could have been put into one of these. He\r\nhad a splendid collection of them, and was famous for the grace with\r\nwhich he opened the lid of his box with the thumb of the hand that\r\ncarried it, while he delicately took his pinch with two fingers of the\r\nother. This and his bow were his chief acquirements, and his reputation\r\nfor manners was based on the distinction of his manner. He could not\r\ndrive in a public conveyance, but he could be rude to a well-meaning\r\nlady; he never ate vegetables--_one_ pea he confessed to--but he did not\r\nmind borrowing from his friends money which he knew he could never\r\nreturn. He was a great gentleman, a gentleman of his patron's school--in\r\nshort, a well-dressed snob. But one thing is due to Brummell: he made\r\nthe assumption of being 'a gentleman' so thoroughly ridiculous that few\r\nmen of keen sense care now for the title: at least, not as a\r\nclass-distinction. Nor is it to be wondered at; when your tailor's\r\nassistant is a 'gentleman,' and would be mightily disgusted at being\r\ncalled anything else, you, with your indomitable pride of caste, can\r\nscarcely care for the patent.\r\n\r\nBrummell's claim to the title was based on his walk, his coat, his\r\ncravat, and the grace with which he indulged, as Captain Jesse\r\ndelightfully calls it, 'the nasal pastime' of taking snuff, all the rest\r\nwas impudence; and many are the anecdotes--most of them familiar as\r\nhousehold words--which are told of his impertinence. The story of Mrs.\r\nJohnson-Thompson is one of those oft-told tales, which, from having\r\nbecome Joe Millers, have gradually passed out of date and been almost\r\nforgotten. Two rival party-givers rejoiced in the aristocratic names of\r\nJohnson and Thompson. The former lived near Finsbury, the latter near\r\nGrosvenor Square, and Mrs. Thompson was somehow sufficiently fashionable\r\nto expect the Regent himself at her assemblies. Brummell among other\r\nimpertinences, was fond of going where he was not invited or wanted. The\r\ntwo rivals gave a ball on the same evening, and a card was sent to the\r\nBeau by her of Finsbury. He chose to go to the Grosvenor Square house,\r\nin hopes of meeting the Regent, then his foe. Mrs. Thompson was justly\r\ndisgusted, and with a vulgarity quite deserved by the intruder, told him\r\nhe was not invited. The Beau made a thousand apologies, hummed, hawed,\r\nand drew a card from his pocket. It was the rival's invitation, and was\r\nindignantly denounced. 'Dear me, how very unfortunate,' said the Beau,\r\n'but you know Johnson and Thompson--I mean Thompson and Johnson are so\r\nvery much alike. Mrs. Johnson-Thompson, I wish you a very good evening.'\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no vulgarity greater than that of rallying people on\r\ntheir surnames, but our exquisite gentleman had not wit enough to invent\r\none superior to such a puerile amusement. Thus, on one occasion, he woke\r\nup at three in the morning a certain Mr. Snodgrass, and when the worthy\r\nput his head out of the window in alarm, said quietly, 'Pray, sir, is\r\nyour name Snodgrass?'--'Yes, sir, it is Snodgrass.' 'Snodgrass--\r\nSnodgrass--it is a very singular name. Good-bye, Mr. _Snodgrass_.' There\r\nwas more wit in his remark to Poodle Byng, a well-known puppy, whom he\r\nmet one day driving in the Park with a French dog in his curricle. 'Ah,'\r\ncried the Beau, 'how d'ye do, Byng? a family vehicle, I see.'\r\n\r\nIt seems incredulous to modern gentlemen that such a man should have\r\nbeen tolerated even at a club. Take, for instance, his vulgar treatment\r\nof Lord Mayor Combe, whose name we still see with others over many a\r\npublic-house in London, and who was then a most prosperous brewer and\r\nthriving gambler. At Brookes' one evening the Beau and the Brewer were\r\nplaying at the same table, 'Come, _Mash-tub_', cried the 'gentleman,'\r\n'what do you set?' Mash-tub unresentingly set a pony, and the Beau won\r\ntwelve of him in succession. Pocketing his cash, he made him a bow, and\r\nexclaimed, 'Thank you, Alderman, in future I shall drink no porter but\r\nyours.' But Combe was worthy of his namesake, Shakspere's friend, and\r\nanswered very aptly, 'I wish, sir, that every _other_ blackguard in\r\nLondon would tell me the same.'\r\n\r\nThen again, after ruining a young fool of fortune at the tables, and\r\nbeing reproached by the youth's father for leading his son astray, he\r\nreplied with charming affectation, 'Why, sir, I did all I could for him.\r\nI once gave him my arm all the way from White's to Brookes'!'\r\n\r\nWhen Brummell really wanted a dinner, while at Calais, he could not give\r\nup his impertinence for the sake of it. Lord Westmoreland called on him,\r\nand, perhaps out of compassion, asked him to dine at _three o'clock_\r\nwith him. 'Your Lordship is very kind,' said the Beau, 'but really I\r\ncould not _feed_ at such an hour.' Sooner or later he was glad to _feed_\r\nwith any one who was toady enough to ask him. He was once placed in a\r\ndelightfully awkward position from having accepted the invitation of a\r\ncharitable but vulgar-looking Britisher at Calais. He was walking with\r\nLord Sefton, when the individual passed and nodded familiarly. 'Who's\r\nyour friend, Brummell?'--'Not mine, he must be bowing to you.' But\r\npresently the man passed again, and this time was cruel enough to\r\nexclaim, 'Don't forget, Brum, don't forget--goose at four!' The poor\r\nBeau must have wished the earth to open under him. He was equally\r\nimprudent in the way in which he treated an old acquaintance who arrived\r\nat the town to which he had retreated, and of whom he was fool enough to\r\nbe ashamed. He generally took away their characters summarily, but on\r\none occasion was frightened almost out of his wits by being called to\r\naccount for this conduct. An officer who had lost his nose in an\r\nengagement in the Peninsula, called on him, and in very strong terms\r\nrequested to know why the Beau had reported that he was a retired\r\nhatter. His manner alarmed the rascal, who apologized, and protested\r\nthat there must be a mistake; he had never said so. The officer retired,\r\nand as he was going, Brummell added: 'Yes, it must be a mistake, for now\r\nI think of it, I never dealt with a hatter without a nose.'\r\n\r\nSo much for the good breeding of this friend of George IV. and the Duke\r\nof York.\r\n\r\nHis affectation was quite as great as his impudence: and he won the\r\nreputation of fastidiousness--nothing gives more prestige--by dint of\r\nbeing openly rude. No hospitality or kindness melted him, when he\r\nthought he could gain a march. At one dinner, not liking the champagne,\r\nhe called to the servant to give him 'some more of that cider:' at\r\nanother, to which he was invited in days when a dinner was a charity to\r\nhim, after helping himself to a wing of capon, and trying a morsel of\r\nit, he took it up in his napkin, called to his dog--he was generally\r\naccompanied by a puppy, even to parties, as if one at a time were not\r\nenough--and presenting it to him, said aloud, 'Here, _Atons_, try if you\r\ncan get your teeth through that, for I'm d--d if I can!'\r\n\r\nTo the last he resented offers of intimacy from those whom he considered\r\nhis inferiors, and as there are ladies enough everywhere, he had ample\r\nopportunity for administering rebuke to those who pressed into his\r\nsociety. On one occasion he was sauntering with a friend at Caen under\r\nthe window of a lady who longed for nothing more than to have the great\r\n_arbiter elegantiarum_ at her house. When seeing him beneath, she put\r\nher head out, and called out to him, 'Good evening, Mr. Brummell, won't\r\nyou come up and take tea?' The Beau looked up with extreme severity\r\nexpressed on his face, and replied, 'Madam, you take medicine--you take\r\na walk--you take a liberty--but you _drink_ tea,' and walked on, having,\r\nit may be hoped, cured the lady of her admiration.\r\n\r\nIn the life of such a man there could not of course be much striking\r\nincident. He lived for 'society,' and the whole of his story consists in\r\nhis rise and fall in that narrow world. Though admired and sought after\r\nby the women--so much so that at his death his chief assets were locks\r\nof hair, the only things he could not have turned into money--he never\r\nmarried. Wedlock might have sobered him, and made him a more sensible,\r\nif not more respectable member of society, but his advances towards\r\nmatrimony never brought him to the crisis. He accounted for one\r\nrejection in his usual way. 'What could I do, my dear _fellar_,' he\r\nlisped, 'when I actually saw Lady Mary eat cabbage?' At another time he\r\nis said to have induced some deluded young creature to elope with him\r\nfrom a ball-room, but managed the affair so ill, that the lovers (?)\r\nwere caught in the next street, and the affair came to an end. He wrote\r\nrather ecstatic love-letters to Lady Marys and Miss ----s, gave married\r\nladies advice on the treatment of their spouses and was tender to\r\nvarious widows, but though he went on in this way through life, he was\r\nnever, it would seem, in love, from the mere fact that he was incapable\r\nof passion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was too much of a woman to care much for women. He was\r\ncertainly egregiously effeminate. About the only creatures he could love\r\nwere poodles. When one of his dogs, from over-feeding, was taken ill, he\r\nsent for two dog-doctors, and consulted very gravely with them on the\r\nremedies to be applied. The canine physicians came to the conclusion\r\nthat she must be bled. 'Bled!' said Brummell, in horror; 'I shall leave\r\nthe room: inform me when the operation is over.' When the dog died, he\r\nshed tears--probably the only ones he had shed since childhood: and\r\nthough at that time receiving money from many an old friend in England,\r\ncomplained, with touching melancholy, 'that he had lost the only friend\r\nhe had!' His grief lasted three whole days, during which he shut himself\r\nup, and would see no one; but we are not told that he ever thus mourned\r\nover any human being.\r\n\r\nHis effeminacy was also shown in his dislike to field-sports. His\r\nshooting exploits were confined to the murder of a pair of pet pigeons\r\nperched on a roof, while he confessed, as regards hunting, that it was a\r\nbore to get up so early in the morning only to have one's boots and\r\nleathers splashed by galloping farmers. However, hunting was a fashion,\r\nand Brummell must needs appear to hunt. He therefore kept a stud of\r\nhunters in his better days, near Belvoir, the Duke of Rutland's, where\r\nhe was a frequent visitor, and if there was a near meet, would ride out\r\nin pink and tops to see the hounds break cover, follow through a few\r\ngates, and return to the more congenial atmosphere of the drawing-room.\r\nHe, however, condescended to bring his taste to bear on the\r\nhunting-dress; and, it is said, introduced white tops instead of the\r\nancient mahoganies. That he _could_ ride there seems reason to believe,\r\nbut it is equally probable that he was afraid to do so. His valour was\r\ncertainly composed almost entirely of its 'better part,' and indeed had\r\nso much prudence in it that it may be doubted if there was any of the\r\noriginal stock left. Once when he had been taking away somebody's\r\ncharacter, the 'friend' of the maligned gentleman entered his apartment,\r\nand very menacingly demanded satisfaction for his principal, unless an\r\napology were tendered 'in five minutes.' 'Five minutes!' answered the\r\nexquisite, as pale as death, 'five seconds, or sooner if you like.'\r\n\r\nBrummell was no fool, in spite of his follies. He had talents of a\r\nmediocre kind, if he had chosen to make a better use of them. Yet the\r\ngeneral opinion was not in favour of his wisdom. He quite deserved\r\nSheridan's cool satire for his affectation, if not for his want of mind.\r\n\r\nThe Wit and the Beau met one day at Charing Cross, and it can well be\r\nimagined that the latter was rather disgusted at being seen so far east\r\nof St. James's Street, and drawled out to Sheridan,--'Sherry, my dear\r\nboy, don't mention that you saw me in this filthy part of the town,\r\nthough, perhaps, I am rather severe, for his Grace of Northumberland\r\nresides somewhere about this spot, if I don't mistake. The fact is, my\r\ndear boy, I have been in the d----d City, to the Bank: I wish they would\r\nremove it to the West End, for re-all-y it is quite a bore to go to such\r\na place; more particularly as one cannot be seen in one's own equipage\r\nbeyond Somerset House,' etc. etc. etc. in the Brummellian style.\r\n\r\n'Nay, my good fellow,' was the answer to this peroration, 'travelling\r\nfrom the East? impossible!'\r\n\r\n'Why, my dear boy, why?'\r\n\r\n'Because the wise men came from the East,'\r\n\r\n'So, then, sa-ar--you think me a fool?'\r\n\r\n'By no means; I know you to be one,' quoth Sherry, and turned away. It\r\nis due to both the parties to this anecdote to state that it is quite\r\napocryphal, and rests on the slenderest authority. However, whether fool\r\nor not, Brummell has one certain, though small, claim upon certain small\r\nreaders. Were you born in a modern generation, when scraps of poetry\r\nwere forbidden in your nursery, and no other pabulum was offered to your\r\ninfant stomach, but the rather dull biographies of rather dull, though\r\nvery upright men?--if so, I pity you. Old airs of a jaunty jig-like kind\r\nare still haunting the echoes of my brain. Among them is--\r\n\r\n  'The butterfly was a gentleman,\r\n  Which nobody can refute:\r\n  He left his lady-love at home,\r\n  And roamed in a velvet suit.'\r\n\r\nI remember often to have ruminated over this character of an innocent,\r\nand, I believe, calumniated, insect. He was a gentleman, and the\r\nconsequences thereof were twofold: he abandoned the young woman who had\r\ntrusted her affections to him, and attired his person in a complete\r\ncostume of the best Lyons silk-velvet, _not_ the proctor's velvet, which\r\nTheodore felt with thumb and finger, impudently asking 'how much a\r\nyard?' I secretly resolved to do the same thing as Mr. Butterfly when I\r\ncame of age. But the said Mr. Butterfly had a varied and somewhat awful\r\nhistory, all of which was narrated in various ditties chanted by my\r\nnurse. I could not quite join in her vivid assertion that she _would_\r\n\r\n  '----be a butterfly,\r\n    Born in a bower,\r\n  Christened in a tea-pot,\r\n    And dead in an hour.'\r\n\r\nAetat four, life is dear, and the idea of that early demise was far from\r\nwelcome to me. I privily agreed that I would _not_ be a butterfly. But\r\nthere was no end to the history of this very inconstant insect in our\r\nnursery lore. We didn't care a drop of honey for Dr. Watts's 'Busy Bee;'\r\nwe infinitely preferred the account--not in the 'Morning Post'--of the\r\n'Butterfly's Ball' and the 'Grasshopper's Feast; and few, perhaps, have\r\never given children more pleasures of imagination than William Roscoe,\r\nits author. There were some amongst us, however, who were already being\r\nweaned to a knowledge of life's mysterious changes, and we sought the\r\nthird volume of the romance of the flitting gaudy thing in a little poem\r\ncalled 'The Butterfly's Funeral.'\r\n\r\nLittle dreamed we, when in our prettly little song-books we saw the\r\ninitial 'B.' at the bottom of these verses, that a real human butterfly\r\nhad written them, and that they conveyed a solemn prognostication of a\r\nfate that was _not_ his. Little we dreamed, as we lisped out the verses,\r\nthat the 'gentleman who roamed in a' not velvet but 'plum-coloured\r\nsuit,' according to Lady Hester Stanhope, was the illustrious George\r\nBrummell, The Beau wrote these trashy little rhymes--pretty in their\r\nway--and, since I was once a child, and learnt them off by heart, I will\r\nnot cast a stone at them. Brummell indulged in such trifling poetizing,\r\nbut never went further. It is a pity he did not write his memoirs; they\r\nwould have added a valuable page to the history of 'Vanity Fair.'\r\n\r\nBrummell's London glory lasted from 1798 to 1816. His chief club was\r\nWatier's. It was a superb assemblage of gamesters and fops--knaves and\r\nfools; and it is difficult to say which, element predominated. For a\r\ntime Brummell was monarch there; but his day of reckoning came at last.\r\nByron and Moore, Sir Henry Mildmay and Mr. Pierrepoint, were among the\r\nmembers. Play ran high there, and Brummell once won nearly as much as\r\nhis squandered patrimony, £26.000. Of course he not only lost it again,\r\nbut much more--indeed his whole capital. It was after some heavy loss\r\nthat he was walking home through Berkeley Street with Mr. Raikes, when\r\nhe saw something glittering in the gutter, picked it up, and found it to\r\nbe a crooked sixpence. Like all small-minded men, he had a great fund of\r\nsuperstition, and he wore the talisman of good luck for some time. For\r\ntwo years, we are told, after this finding of treasure-trove, success\r\nattended him in play--macao, the very pith of hazard, was the chief game\r\nat Watier's--and he attributed it all to the sixpence. At last he lost\r\nit, and luck turned against him. So goes the story. It is probably much\r\nmore easily accountable. Few men played honestly in those days without\r\nlosing to the dishonest, and we have no reason to charge the Beau with\r\nmal-practice. However this may be, his losses at play first brought\r\nabout his ruin. The Jews were, of course, resorted to; and if Brummell\r\ndid not, like Charles Fox, keep a Jerusalem Chamber, it was only because\r\nthe sum total of his fortune was pretty well known to the money-lenders.\r\n\r\n  'Then came the change, the check, the fall;\r\n  Pain rises up, old pleasures pall.\r\n  There is one remedy for all.'\r\n\r\nThis remedy was the crossing of the Channel, a crossing kept by beggars,\r\nwho levy a heavy toll on those who pass over it.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the Beau was rapid, but not without its _éclat_. A breach\r\nwith his royal patron led the way. It is presumed that every reader of\r\nthese volumes has heard the famous story of 'Wales, ring the bell!' but\r\nnot all may know its particulars.\r\n\r\nA deep impenetrable mystery hangs over this story. Perhaps some German\r\nof the twenty-first century--some future Giffard, or who not--will put\r\nhis wits to work to solve the riddle. In very sooth _il ne vaut pas la\r\nchandelle_. A quarrel did take place between George the Prince and\r\nGeorge the Less, but of its causes no living mortal is cognizant: we can\r\nonly give the received versions. It appears, then, that dining with\r\nH.R.H. the Prince of Wales, Master Brummell asked him to ring the bell.\r\nConsidering the intimacy between them, and that the Regent often\r\nsacrificed his dignity to his amusement, there was nothing extraordinary\r\nin this. But it is added that the Prince did ring the bell in\r\nquestion--unhappy bell to jar so between two such illustrious\r\nfriends!--and when the servant came, ordered 'Mr. Brummell's carriage!'\r\nAnother version palms off the impertinence on a drunken midshipman, who,\r\nbeing related to the Comptroller of the Household, had been invited to\r\ndinner by the Regent. Another yet states that Brummell, being asked to\r\nring the said bell, replied, 'Your Royal Highness is close to it.' No\r\none knows the truth of the legend, any more than whether Homer was a man\r\nor a myth. It surely does not matter. The friends quarrelled, and\r\nperhaps it was time they should do so, for they had never improved one\r\nanother's morals; but it is only fair to the Beau to add that he always\r\ndenied the whole affair, and that he himself gave as the cause of the\r\nquarrel his own sarcasms on the Prince's increasing corpulency, and his\r\nresemblance to Mrs. Fitzherbert's porter, 'Big Ben.' Certainly some\r\npraise is due to the Beau for the _sans, froid_ with which he appeared\r\nto treat the matter, though in reality dreadfully cut up about it. He\r\nlounged about, made amusing remarks on his late friend and patron, swore\r\nhe would 'cut' him, and in short behaved with his usual _aplomb_. The\r\n'Wales, ring the bell,' was sufficient proof of his impudence, but\r\n'Who's your fat friend?' was really good.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, in all probability, that George IV. contemplated with\r\nas much disgust and horror the increasing rotundity of his 'presence' as\r\never a maiden lady of a certain age did her first grey hair. Soon after\r\nthe bell affair, the royal beau met his former friend in St. James's\r\nStreet, and resolved to cut him. This was attacking Brummell with his\r\nown pet weapon, but not with success. Each antagonist was leaning on the\r\narm of a friend. 'Jack Lee,' who was thus supporting the Beau, was\r\nintimate with the Prince, who, to make the cut the more marked, stopped\r\nand talked to him without taking the slightest notice of Brummell. After\r\na time both parties moved on, and then came the moment of triumph and\r\nrevenge. It was sublime! Turning round half way, so that his words could\r\nnot fail to be heard by the retreating Regent, the Beau asked of his\r\ncompanion in his usual drawl, 'Well, Jack, who's your fat friend?' The\r\ncoolness, presumption, and impertinence of the question perhaps made it\r\nthe best thing the Beau ever said, and from that time the Prince took\r\ncare not to risk another encounter with him.[11]\r\n\r\n[11: Another version, given by Captain Jesse, represents this to have\r\ntaken place at a ball given at the Argyle Rooms in July, 1813, by Lord\r\nAlvanley, Sir Henry Miklmav, Mr. Pierrepoint, and Mr. Brummell.]\r\n\r\nBrummell was scotched rather than killed by the Prince's indifference.\r\nHe at once resolved to patronise his brother, the Duke of York, and\r\nfound in him a truer friend. The duchess, who had a particular fondness\r\nfor dogs, of which she is said to have kept no fewer, at one time, than\r\na hundred, added the puppy Brummell to the list, and treated him with a\r\nkindness in which little condescension was mixed. But neither impudence\r\nnor the blood-royal can keep a man out of debt, especially when he\r\nplays. The Beau got deeper and deeper into the difficulty, and at last\r\nsome mysterious quarrel about money with a gentleman who thenceforward\r\nwent by the name of Dick the Dandy-killer, obliged him to think of place\r\nand poverty in another land. He looked in vain for aid, and among others\r\nScrope Davies was written to to lend him 'two hundred,' 'because his\r\nmoney was all in the three per cents.' Scrope replied laconically--\r\n\r\n    'MY DEAR GEORGE,\r\n\r\n    'It is very unfortunate, but _my_ money is all in the three per\r\n    cents. Yours,\r\n\r\n    'S. DAVIES,'\r\n\r\nIt was the last attempt. The Beau went to the opera, as usual, and drove\r\naway from it clear off to Dover, whence the packet took him to safety\r\nand slovenliness in the ancient town of Calais. His few effects were\r\nsold after his departure. Porcelaine, buhl, a drawing or two,\r\ndouble-barrelled Mantons (probably never used), plenty of old wine,\r\nlinen, furniture, and a few well-bound books, were the Beau's assets.\r\nHis debts were with half the chief tradesmen of the West End and a large\r\nnumber of his personal friends.\r\n\r\nThe climax is reached: henceforth Master George Bryan Brummell goes\r\nrapidly and gracefully down the hill of life.\r\n\r\nThe position of a Calais beggar was by no means a bad one, if the\r\nreduced individual had any claim whatever to distinction. A black-mail\r\nwas sedulously levied by the outcasts and exiles of that town on every\r\nEnglishman who passed through it; and in those days it was customary to\r\npass some short time in this entrance of France. The English 'residents'\r\nwere always on the look-out, generally crowding round the packet-boat,\r\nand the new arrival was sure to be accosted by some old and attached\r\nfriend, who had not seen him for years. Just as Buttons, who is always\r\nbreaking the plates and tumblers, has the invariable mode of accounting\r\nfor his carelessness, 'they fell apart, sir, in my 'ands!' so these\r\nexpatriated Britons had always a tale of confidence misplaced--security\r\nfor a bond--bail for a delinquent, or in short any hard case, which\r\ncompelled them, much against their wills, to remain 'for a period' on\r\nthe shores of France. To such men, whom you had known in seven-guinea\r\nwaistcoats at White's and Watier's, and found in seven-shilling coats on\r\nthe Calais pier, it was impossible to refuse your five-pound note, and\r\nin time the black-mail of Calais came to be reckoned among the\r\nestablished expenses of a Continental tour.\r\n\r\nBrummell was a distinguished beggar of this description, and managed so\r\nadroitly that the new arrivals thought themselves obliged by Mr.\r\nBrummell's acceptance of their donations. The man who could not eat\r\ncabbages, drive in a hackney-coach, or wear less than three shirts a\r\nday, was now supported by voluntary contributions, and did not see\r\nanything derogatory to a gentleman in their acceptance. If Brummell had\r\nnow turned his talents to account; if he had practised his painting, in\r\nwhich he was not altogether despicable; or his poetry, in which he had\r\nalready had some trifling success: if he had even engaged himself as a\r\nwaiter at Quillacq's, or given lessons in the art of deportment, his\r\nfine friends from town might have cut him, but posterity would have\r\nwithheld its blame. He was a beggar of the merriest kind. While he wrote\r\nletters to friends in England, asking for remittances, and describing\r\nhis wretched condition on a bed of straw and eating bran bread, he had a\r\ngood barrel of Dorchester ale in his lodgings, his usual glass of\r\nmaraschino, and his bottle of claret after dinner; and though living on\r\ncharity, could order new snuff-boxes to add to his collection, and new\r\nknick-knacks to adorn his room. There can be no pity for such a man, and\r\nwe have no pity for him, whatever the rest of the world may feel.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more contemptible than the gradual downfall of the broken\r\nbeau. Yet, if it were doubted that his soul ever rose above the collar\r\nof a coat or the brim of a hat, his letters to Mr. Raikes in the time of\r\nhis poverty would settle the question. 'I heard of you the other day in\r\na waistcoat that does you considerable credit, spick-and-span from\r\nParis, a broad stripe, salmon-colour, and _cramoisé_. Don't let them\r\nlaugh you into a relapse--into the Gothic--as that of your former\r\nEnglish simplicity.' He speaks of the army of occupation as 'rascals in\r\nred coats waiting for embarkation.' 'English education,' he says in\r\nanother letter, 'may be all very well to instruct the hemming of\r\nhandkerchiefs, and the ungainly romps of a country-dance, but nothing\r\nelse; and it would be a poor consolation to your declining years to see\r\nyour daughters come into the room upon their elbows, and to find their\r\naccomplishments limited to broad native phraseology in conversation, or\r\nthumping the \"Woodpecker\" upon a discordant spinet.' And he proceeds to\r\nrecommend a 'good French formation of manners,' and so forth.\r\n\r\nNor did he display any of that dignity and self-respect which are\r\ngenerally supposed to mark the 'gentleman.' When his late friend and\r\nfoe, by this time a king, passed through Calais, the Beau, broken in\r\nevery sense, had not pride enough to keep out of his way. Many stories\r\nare told of the manner in which he pressed himself into George IV.'s\r\nnotice, but the various legends mostly turn upon a certain snuff-box.\r\nAccording to one quite as reliable as any other, the Prince and the Beau\r\nhad in their days of amity intended to exchange snuff-boxes, and George\r\nthe Greater had given George the Less an order on his jeweller for a\r\n_tabatière_ with his portrait on the top. On their quarrel this order\r\nwas, with very bad taste, rescinded, although Brummell's snuff-box had\r\nalready passed into the Prince's hands and had not been returned. It is\r\nsaid that the Beau employed a friend to remind the king of this\r\nagreement, and ask for his box; to whom the latter said that the story\r\nwas all nonsense, and that he supposed 'the poor devil,' meaning his\r\nlate intimate friend, wanted £100 and should have it. However, it is\r\ndoubtful if the money ever reached the 'poor devil.' The story does not\r\ntell over well, for whatever were the failings and faults of George IV.,\r\nhe seems to have had a certain amount of good nature, if not absolutely\r\nof good heart, and possessed, at least, sufficient sense of what became\r\na prince, to prevent his doing so shabby an act, though he may have\r\ndefrauded a hundred tradesmen. In these days there _were_ such things as\r\n'debts of honour,' and they were punctiliously attended to. There are,\r\nas we have said, various versions of this story, but all tend to show\r\nthat Brummell courted the notice of his late master and patron on his\r\nway through the place of his exile; and it is not remarkable in a man\r\nwho borrowed so freely from all his acquaintances, and who was, in fact,\r\nin such a state of dependence on their liberality.\r\n\r\nBrummell made one grand mistake in his career as a Beau: he outlived\r\nhimself. For some twenty-four years he survived his flight from England,\r\nto which country he never returned. For a time he was an assiduous\r\nwriter of begging-letters and the plague of his friends. At length he\r\nobtained the appointment of consul at the good old Norman town of Caen.\r\nThis was almost a sinecure, and the Beau took care to keep it so. But no\r\none can account for the extraordinary step he took soon after entering\r\non his consular duties. He wrote to Lord Palmerston, stating that there\r\nwere no duties attached to the post, and recommending its abolition.\r\nThis act of suicide is partly explained by a supposed desire to be\r\nappointed to some more lively and more lucrative consulate; but in this\r\nthe Beau was mistaken. The consulate at Caen was vacated in accordance\r\nwith his suggestion, and Brummell was left penniless, in debt, and to\r\nshift for himself. With the aid of an English tradesman, half grocer,\r\nhalf banker, he managed to get through a period of his poverty, but\r\ncould not long subsist in this way, and the punishment of his vanity and\r\nextravagance came at last in his old age. A term of existence in prison\r\ndid not cure him, and when he was liberated he again resumed his\r\nprimrose gloves, his Eau de Cologne, and his patent _vernis_ for his\r\nboots, though at that time literally supported by his friends with an\r\nallowance of £120 per annum. In the old days of Caen life this would\r\nhave been equal to £300 a year in England, and certainly quite enough\r\nfor any bachelor; but the Beau was really a fool. For whom, for what\r\nshould he dress and polish his boots at such a quiet place as Caen? Yet\r\nhe continued to do so, and to run into debt for the polish. When he\r\nconfessed to having, 'so help him Heaven,' not four francs in the world,\r\nhe was ordering this _vernis de Guiton_, at five francs a bottle, from\r\nParis, and calling the provider of it a 'scoundrel,' because he ventured\r\nto ask for his money. What foppery, what folly was all this! How truly\r\nworthy of the man who built his fame on the reputation of a coat!\r\nTerrible indeed was the hardship that followed his extravagance; he was\r\nactually compelled to exchange his white for a black cravat. Poor\r\nmartyr! after such a trial it is impossible to be hard upon him. So,\r\ntoo, the man who sent repeated begging-letters to the English grocer,\r\nArmstrong, threw out of window a new dressing-gown because it was not of\r\nthe pattern he wished to have.\r\n\r\nRetribution for all this folly came in time. His mind went even before\r\nhis health. Though only some sixty years of age, almost the bloom of\r\nsome men's life, he lost his memory and his powers of attention, His old\r\nill-manners became positively bad manners. When feasted and feted, he\r\ncould find nothing better to say than 'What a half-starved turkey.' At\r\nlast the Beau was reduced to the level of that slovenliness which he had\r\nconsidered as the next step to perdition. Reduced to one pair of\r\ntrousers, he had to remain in bed till they were mended. He grew\r\nindifferent to his personal appearance, the surest sign of decay.\r\nDrivelling, wretched, in debt, an object of contempt to all honest men,\r\nhe dragged on a miserable existence. Still with his boots in holes, and\r\nall the honour of beau-dom gone for ever, he clung to the last to his\r\nEau de Cologne, and some few other luxuries, and went down, a fool and a\r\nfop, to the grave. To indulge his silly tastes he had to part with one\r\npiece of property after another; and at length he was left with little\r\nelse than the locks of hair of which he had once boasted.\r\n\r\nI remember a story of a labourer and his dying wife. The poor woman was\r\nbreathing her last wishes. 'And, I say, William, you'll see the old sow\r\ndon't kill her young uns?'--'Ay, ay, wife, set thee good.' 'And, I say,\r\nWilliam, you'll see Lizzy goes to schule reg'lar?'--'Ay, ay, wife, set\r\nthee good.' 'And, I say, William, you'll see Tommy's breeches is mended\r\nagainst he goes to schule again?'--'Ay, ay, wife, set thee good.'--'And,\r\nI say, William, you'll see I'm laid proper in the yard?' William grew\r\nimpatient. 'Now never thee mind them things, wife, I'll see to 'em all,\r\nyou just go on with your dying.' No doubt Brummell's friends heartily\r\nwished that he would go on with his dying, for he had already lived too\r\nlong; but he would live on. He is described in his last days as a\r\nmiserable, slovenly, half-witted old creature, creeping about to the\r\nhouses of a few friends he retained or who were kind enough to notice\r\nhim still, jeered at by the _gamins_, and remarkable now, not for the\r\ncleanliness, but the filthiness and raggedness of his attire.\r\n\r\nPoor old fool! one cannot but pity him, when wretched, friendless, and\r\nmiserable as he was, we find him, still graceful, in a poor _café_ near\r\nthe Place Royale, taking his cup of coffee, and when asked for the\r\namount of his bill, answering very vaguely, 'Oui, Madame, à la pleine\r\nlune, à la pleine lune.'\r\n\r\nThe drivellings of old age are no fit subject for ridicule, yet in the\r\ncase of a man who had sneered so freely at his fellow-creatures, they\r\nmay afford a useful lesson. One of his fancies was to give imaginary\r\nparties, when his tallow dips were all set alight and his servant\r\nannounced with proper decorum, 'The Duchess of Devonshire,' 'Lord\r\nAlvanley, 'Mr. Sheridan,' or whom not. The poor old idiot received the\r\nimaginary visitors with the old bow, and talked to them in the old\r\nstrain, till his servant announced their imaginary carriages, and he was\r\nput drivelling to bed. At last the idiocy became mania. He burnt his\r\nbooks, his relics, his tokens. He ate enormously, and the man who had\r\nlooked upon beer as the _ne plus ultra_ of vulgarity, was glad to\r\nimagine it champagne. Let us not follow the poor maniac through his\r\nwanderings. Rather let us throw a veil over all his drivelling\r\nwretchedness, and find him at his last gasp, when coat and collar, hat\r\nand brim, were all forgotten, when the man who had worn three shirts a\r\nday was content to change his linen once a month. What a lesson, what a\r\nwarning! If Brummell had come to this pass in England, it is hard to say\r\nhow and where he would have died. He was now utterly penniless, and had\r\nno prospect of receiving any remittances. It was determined to remove\r\nhim to the Hospice du Bon Sauveur, a _Maison de Charité_, where he would\r\nbe well cared for at no expense. The mania of the poor creature took, as\r\never, the turn of external preparation. When the landlord of his inn\r\nentered to try and induce him to go, he found him with his wig on his\r\nknee, his shaving apparatus by his side, and the quondam beau deeply\r\ninterested in lathering the peruke as a preliminary to shearing it. He\r\nresisted every proposal to move, and was carried down stairs, kicking\r\nand shrieking. Once lodged in the Hospice, he was treated by the soeurs\r\nde charité with the greatest kindness and consideration. An attempt was\r\nmade to recall him to a sense of his future peril, that he might at\r\nleast die in a more religious mood than he had lived; but in vain. It is\r\nnot for us, erring and sinful as we are, to judge any fellow-creature;\r\nbut perhaps poor Brummell was the last man to whom religion had a\r\nmeaning. His heart was good; his sins were more those of vanity than\r\nthose of hate; it may be that they are regarded mercifully where the\r\nfund of mercy is unbounded. God grant that they may be so; or who of us\r\nwould escape? None but fiends will triumph over the death of any man in\r\nsin. Men are not fiends; they must and will always feel for their\r\nfellow-men, let them die as they will. No doubt Brummell was a fool--a\r\nfool of the first water, but that he was equally a knave was not so\r\ncertain. Let it never be certain to blind man, who cannot read the\r\nheart, that any man is a knave. He died on the 30th of March, 1840, and\r\nso the last of the Beaux passed away. People have claimed, indeed for\r\nD'Orsay, the honour of Brummell's descending mantle, but D'Orsay was not\r\nstrictly a beau, for he had other and higher tastes than mere dress. It\r\nhas never been advanced that Brummell's heart was bad, in spite of his\r\nmany faults. Vanity did all. Vanitas vanitatem. O young men of this age,\r\nbe warned by a Beau, and flee his doubtful reputation! Peace then to the\r\ncoat-thinker. Peace to all--to the worst. Let us look within and not\r\njudge. It is enough that we are not tried in the same balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODORE EDWARD HOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greatest of Modern Wits.---What Coleridge said of Hook.--Hook's\r\nFamily.--Redeeming Points.--Versatility.--Varieties of Hoaxing.--The\r\nBlack-wafered Horse.--The Berners Street Hoax.--Success of the Scheme.--\r\nThe Strop of Hunger.--Kitchen Examinations.--The Wrong House.--Angling\r\nfor an Invitation.--The Hackney-coach Device.--The Plots of Hook and\r\nMathews.--Hook's Talents as an Improvisatore.--The Gift becomes his\r\nBane.--Hook's Novels.--College Fun.--Baiting a Proctor.--The Punning\r\nFaculty.--Official Life Opens.--Troublesome Pleasantry.--Charge of\r\nEmbezzlement.--Misfortune.--Doubly Disgraced.--No Effort to remove the\r\nStain.--Attacks on the Queen.--An Incongruous Mixture.--Specimen of the\r\nRamsbottom Letters.--Hook's Scurrility.--Fortune and Popularity.--The End.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it be difficult to say what wit is, it is well nigh as hard to\r\npronounce what is not wit. In a sad world, mirth hath its full honour,\r\nlet it come in rags or in purple raiment. The age that patronises a\r\n'Punch' every Saturday? and a pantomime every Christmas, has no right to\r\ncomplain, if it finds itself barren of wits, while a rival age has\r\nbrought forth her dozens. Mirth is, no doubt, very good. We would see\r\nmore, not less, of it in this unmirthful land. We would fain imagine the\r\nshrunken-cheeked factory-girl singing to herself a happy burthen, as she\r\nshifts the loom,--the burthen of her life, and fain believe that the\r\nvoice was innocent as the sky-lark's. But if it be not so--and we know\r\nit is not so--shall we quarrel with any one who tries to give the poor\r\ncare-worn, money-singing public a little laughter for a few pence? No,\r\ntruly, but it does not follow that the man who raises a titter is, of\r\nnecessity, a wit. The next age, perchance, will write a book of 'Wits\r\nand Beaux,' in which Mr. Douglas Jerrold, Mr. Mark Lemon, and so on,\r\nwill represent the _wit_ of this passing day; and that future age will\r\nnot ask so nicely what wit is, and not look for that last solved of\r\nriddles, its definition. Hook has been, by common consent, placed at the\r\nhead of modern wits. When kings were kings, they bullied, beat, and and\r\nbrow-beat their jesters. Now and then they treated them to a few years\r\nin the Tower for a little extra impudence. Now that the people are\r\nsovereign, the jester fares better--nay, too well. His books or his\r\nbon-mots are read with zest and grins; he is invited to his Grace's and\r\nimplored to my Lord's; he is waited for, watched, pampered like a small\r\nGrand Lama, and, in one sentence, the greater the fool, the more fools\r\nhe makes.\r\n\r\nIf Theodore Hook had lived in the stirring days of King Henry VIII., he\r\nwould have sent Messrs. Patch and Co. sharply to the right-about, and\r\nbeen presented with the caps and bells after his first comic song. No\r\ndoubt he was a jester, a fool in many senses, though he did not, like\r\nSolomon's fool, 'say in his _heart_' very much. He jested away even the\r\npracticals of life, jested himself into disgrace, into prison, into\r\ncontempt, into the basest employment--that of a libeller tacked on to a\r\nparty. He was a mimic, too, to whom none could send a challenge; an\r\nimprovisatore, who beat Italians, Tyroleans, and Styrians hollow, sir,\r\nhollow. And lastly--oh! shame of the shuffle-tongued--he was, too, a\r\npunster. Yes, one who gloried in puns, a maker of pun upon pun, a man\r\nwhose whole wit ran into a pun as readily as water rushes into a hollow,\r\nwho could not keep out of a pun, let him loathe it or not, and who made\r\nsome of the best and some of the worst on record, but still--puns.\r\n\r\nIf he was a wit withal, it was _malgré soi_, for fun, not for wit, was\r\nhis 'aspiration.' Yet the world calls him a wit, and he has a claim to\r\nhis niche. There were, it is true, many a man in his own set who had\r\nmore real wit. There were James Smith, Thomas Ingoldsby, Tom Hill, and\r\nothers. Out of his set, but of his time, there was Sydney Smith, ten\r\ntimes more a wit: but Theodore could amuse, Theodore could astonish,\r\nTheodore could be at home anywhere; he had all the impudence, all the\r\nreadiness, all the indifference of a jester, and a jester he was.\r\n\r\nLet any one look at his portrait, and he will doubt if this be the\r\nking's jester, painted by Holbein, or Mr. Theodore Hook, painted by\r\nEddis. The short, thick nose, the long upper lip, the sensual, whimsical\r\nmouth, the twinkling eyes, all belong to the regular maker of fun. Hook\r\nwas a certificated jester, with a lenient society to hear and applaud\r\nhim, instead of an irritable tyrant to keep him in order: and he filled\r\nhis post well. Whether he was more than a jester may well be doubted;\r\nyet Coleridge, when he heard him, said: 'I have before in my time met\r\nwith men of admirable promptitude of intellectual power and play of wit,\r\nwhich, as Stillingfleet says:\r\n\r\n  \"The rays of wit gild wheresoe'er they strike,\"\r\n\r\nbut I never could have conceived such readiness of mind and resources of\r\ngenius to be poured out on the mere subject and impulse of the moment.'\r\nThe poet was wrong in one respect. Genius can in no sense be applied to\r\nHook, though readiness was his chief charm.\r\n\r\nThe famous Theodore was born in the same year as Byron, 1788, the one on\r\nthe 22nd of January, the other on the 22nd of September; so the poet was\r\nonly nine months his senior. Hook, like many other wits, was a second\r\nson. Ladies of sixty or seventy well remember the name of Hook as that\r\nwhich accompanied their earliest miseries. It was in learning Hook's\r\nexercises, or primers, or whatever they were called, that they first had\r\ntheir fingers slapped over the piano-forte. The father of Theodore, no\r\ndoubt, was the unwitting cause of much unhappiness to many a young lady\r\nin her teens. Hook _père_ was an organist at Norwich. He came up to\r\ntown, and was engaged at Marylebone Gardens and at Vauxhall; so that\r\nTheodore had no excuse for being of decidedly plebeian origin, and, Tory\r\nas he was, he was not fool enough to aspire to patricianism.\r\n\r\nTheodore's family was, in real fact, Theodore himself. He made the name\r\nwhat it is, and raised himself to the position he at one time held. Yet\r\nhe had a brother whose claims to celebrity are not altogether ancillary.\r\nJames Hook was fifteen years older than Theodore. After leaving\r\nWestminster School he was sent to immortal Skimmery (St. Mary's Hall),\r\nOxford, which has fostered so many great men--and spoiled them. He was\r\nadvanced in the church from one preferment to another, and ultimately\r\nbecame Dean of Worcester. The character of the reverend gentleman is\r\npretty well known, but it is unnecessary here to go into it farther. He\r\nis only mentioned as Theodore's brother in this sketch.[12] He was a\r\ndabbler in literature, like his brother, but scarcely to the same extent\r\na dabbler in wit.\r\n\r\n[12: Dr. James Hook, Dean of Worcester, was father to Dr. Walter\r\nFarquhar Hook, now the excellent Dean of Chichester, late Vicar of\r\nLeeds.]\r\n\r\nThe younger son of 'Hook's Exercises' developed early enough a taste for\r\ningenious lying--so much admired in his predecessor--Sheridan, He\r\n'fancied himself' a genius, and therefore, from school-age, not amenable\r\nto the common laws of ordinary men. Frequenters of the now fashionable\r\nprize-ring--thanks to two brutes who have brought that degraded pastime\r\ninto prominent notice--will hear a great deal about a man 'fancying\r\nhimself.' It is common slang and heeds little explanation. Hook 'fancied\r\nhimself' from an early period, and continued to 'fancy himself,' in\r\nspite of repeated disgraces, till a very mature age. At Harrow, he was\r\nthe contemporary, but scarcely the friend, of Lord Byron. No two\r\ncharacters could have been more unlike. Every one knows, more or less,\r\nwhat Byron's was; it need only be said that Hook's was the reverse of it\r\nin every respect. Byron felt where Hook laughed. Byron was morbid where\r\nHook was gay. Byron abjured with disgust the social vices to which he\r\nwas introduced; Hook fell in with them. Byron indulged in vice in a\r\nromantic way; Hook in the coarsest. There is some excuse for Byron, much\r\nas he has been blamed. There is little or no excuse for Hook, much as\r\nhis faults have been palliated. The fact is that goodness of heart will\r\nsoften, in men's minds, any or all misdemeanours. Hook, in spite of many\r\nvulgar witticisms and cruel jokes, seems to have had a really good\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nI have it on the authority of one of Hook's most intimate friends, that\r\nhe was capable of any act of kindness, and by way of instance of his\r\ngoodness of heart, I am told by the same person that he on one occasion\r\nquitted all his town amusements to solace the spirit of a friend in the\r\ncountry who was in serious trouble. I, of course, refrain from giving\r\nnames: but the same person informs me that much of his time was devoted\r\nin a like manner, to relieving, as far as possible, the anxiety of his\r\nfriends, often, indeed, arising from his own carelessness. It is due to\r\nHook to make this impartial statement before entering on a sketch of his\r\n'Sayings and Doings,' which must necessarily leave the impression that\r\nhe was a heartless man.\r\n\r\nOld Hook, the father, soon perceived the value of his son's talents;\r\nand, determined to turn them to account, encouraged his natural\r\ninclination to song-writing. At the age of sixteen Theodore wrote a kind\r\nof comic opera, to which his father supplied the music. This was called\r\n'The Soldier's Return.' It was followed by others, and young Hook, not\r\nyet out of his teens, managed to keep a Drury Lane audience alive, as\r\nwell as himself and family. It must be remembered, however, that Liston\r\nand Matthews could make almost any piece amusing. The young author was\r\nintroduced behind the scenes through his father's connection with the\r\ntheatre, and often played the fool under the stage while others were\r\nplaying it for him above it, practical jokes being a passion with him\r\nwhich he developed thus early. These tricks were not always very\r\ngood-natured, which may be said of many of his jokes out of the theatre.\r\n\r\nHe soon showed evidence of another talent, that of acting as well as\r\nwriting pieces. Assurance was one of the main features of his character,\r\nand to it he owed his success in society; but it is a remarkable fact,\r\nthat on his first appearance before an audience he entirely lost all his\r\nnerve, turned pale, and could scarcely utter a syllable. He rapidly\r\nrecovered, however, and from this time became a favourite performer in\r\nprivate theatricals, in which he was supported by Mathews and Mrs.\r\nMathews, and some amateurs who were almost equal to any professional\r\nactors. His attempts were, of course, chiefly in broad farce and roaring\r\nburlesque, in which his comic face, with its look of mock gravity, and\r\nthe twinkle of the eyes, itself excited roars of laughter. Whether he\r\nwould have succeeded as well in sober comedy or upon public boards may\r\nwell be doubted. Probably he would not have given to the profession that\r\ncareful attention and entire devotion that are necessary to bring\r\nforward properly the highest natural talents. It is said that for a long\r\ntime he was anxious to take to the stage as, a profession, but,\r\nperhaps--as the event seems to show--unfortunately for him, he was\r\ndissuaded from what his friends must have thought a very rash step, and\r\nin after years he took a violent dislike to the profession. Certainly\r\nthe stage could not have offered more temptations than did the society\r\nin which he afterwards mixed; and perhaps under any circumstances Hook,\r\nwhose moral education had been neglected, and whose principles were\r\nnever very good, would have lived a life more or less vicious, though he\r\nmight not have died as he did.\r\n\r\nHook, however, was not long in coming very prominently before the public\r\nin another capacity. Of all stories told about him, none are more common\r\nor more popular than those which relate to his practical jokes and\r\nhoaxes. Thank heaven, the world no longer sees amusement in the misery\r\nof others, and the fashion of such clever performance is gone out. It is\r\nfair, however, to premise, that while the cleverest of Hook's hoaxes\r\nwere of a victimizing character, a large number were just the reverse,\r\nand his admirers affirm, not without some reason, that when he had got a\r\ndinner out of a person whom he did not know, by an ingenious lie,\r\nadmirably supported, he fully paid for it in the amusement he afforded\r\nhis host and the ringing metal of his wit. As we have all been\r\nboys--except those that were girls--and not all of us very good boys, we\r\ncan appreciate that passion for robbery which began with orchards and\r\npassed on to knockers. It is difficult to sober middle-age to imagine\r\nwhat entertainment there can be in that breach of the eighth\r\ncommandment, which is generally regarded as innocent. As Sheridan\r\nswindled in fun, so Hook, as a young man, robbed in fun, as hundreds of\r\nmedical students and others have done before and since. Hook, however,\r\nwas a proficient in the art, and would have made a successful\r\n'cracksman' had he been born in the Seven Dials. He collected a complete\r\nmuseum of knockers, bell-pulls, wooden Highlanders, barbers' poles, and\r\nshop signs of all sorts. On one occasion he devoted a whole fortnight to\r\nthe abstraction of a golden eagle over a shop window, by means of a\r\nlasso. A fellow dilettante in the art had confidentially informed him of\r\nits whereabouts, adding that he himself despaired of ever obtaining it.\r\nAt length Hook invited his friend to dinner, and on the removal of the\r\ncover of what was supposed to be the joint, the work of art appeared\r\nserved up and appropriately garnished. Theodore was radiant with\r\ntriumph; but the friend, probably thinking that there ought to be honour\r\namong thieves, was highly indignant at being thus surpassed.\r\n\r\nAnother achievement of this kind was the robbery of a life-sized\r\nHighlander, who graced the door of some unsuspecting tobacconist. There\r\nwas little difficulty in the mere displacement of the figure; the\r\ntroublesome part of the business was to get the bare legged Celt home to\r\nthe museum, where probably many a Lilliputian of his race was already\r\nawaiting him. A cloak, a hat, and Hook's ready wit effected the\r\ntransfer. The first was thrown over him, the second set upon his\r\nbonneted head, and a passing hackney coach hailed by his captor, who\r\nbefore the unsuspecting driver could descend, had opened the door,\r\npushed in the prize, and whispered to Jehu, 'My friend--very respectable\r\nman but rather tipsy.' How he managed to get him out again at the end of\r\nthe journey we are not told.\r\n\r\nHook was soon a successful and valuable writer of light pieces for the\r\nstage. But farces do not live, and few of Hook's are now favourites with\r\na public which is always athirst for something new. The incidents of\r\nmost of the pieces--many of them borrowed from the French--excited\r\nlaughter by their very improbability; but the wit which enlivened them\r\nwas not of a high order, and Hook, though so much more recent than\r\nSheridan, has disappeared before him.\r\n\r\nBut his hoaxes were far more famous than his collection of curiosities,\r\nand quite as much to the purpose; and the imprudence he displayed in\r\nthem was only equalled by the quaintness of the humour which suggested\r\nthem. Who else would have ever thought, for instance, of covering a\r\nwhite horse with black wafers, and driving it in a gig along a Welsh\r\nhigh-road, merely for the satisfaction of being stared at? It was almost\r\nworthy of Barnum. Or who, with less assurance, could have played so\r\nadmirably on the credulity of a lady and daughters fresh from the\r\ncountry as he did, at the trial of Lord Melville? The lady, who stood\r\nnext to him, was, naturally, anxious to understand the proceedings, and\r\nbetrayed her ignorance at once by a remark which she made to her\r\ndaughter about the procession of the Lords into the House. When the\r\nbishops entered in full episcopal costume, she applied to Hook to know\r\nwho were 'those gentlemen?' 'Gentlemen,' quoth Hook, with charming\r\nsimplicity; 'ladies, I think you mean; at any rate, those are the\r\ndowager peeresses in their own right.' Question followed question as the\r\nprocession came on, and Theodore indulged his fancy more and more. At\r\nlength the Speaker, in full robes, became the subject of inquiry. 'And\r\npray, sir, who is that fine looking person?'--'That, ma'am, is Cardinal\r\nWolsey,' was the calm and audacious reply. This was too much even for\r\nSussex; and the lady drew herself up in majestic indignation. 'We know\r\nbetter than that, sir,' she replied: 'Cardinal Wolsey has been dead many\r\na good year.' Theodore was unmoved. 'No such thing, my dear madam,' he\r\nanswered, without the slightest sign of perturbation: 'I know it has\r\nbeen generally reported so in the country, but without the slightest\r\nfoundation; the newspapers, you know, will say anything.'\r\n\r\nBut the hoax of hoaxes, the one which filled the papers of the time for\r\nseveral days, and which, eventually, made its author the very prince of\r\nhoaxsters, if such a term can be admitted, was that of Berners Street.\r\nNever, perhaps, was so much trouble expended, or so much attention\r\ndevoted, to so frivolous an object. In Berners Street there lived an\r\nelderly lady, who, for no reason that can be ascertained, had excited\r\nthe animosity of the young Theodore Hook, who was then just of age. Six\r\nweeks were spent in preparation, and three persons engaged in the\r\naffair. Letters were sent off in every direction, and Theodore Hook's\r\nautograph, if it could have any value, must have been somewhat low in\r\nthe market at that period, from the number of applications which he\r\nwrote. On the day in question he and his accomplices seated themselves\r\nat a window in Berners Street, opposite to that unfortunate Mrs.\r\nTottenham, of No 54, and there enjoyed the fun. Advertisements,\r\nannouncements, letters, circulars, and what not, had been most freely\r\nissued, and were as freely responded to. A score of sweeps, all 'invited\r\nto attend professionally,' opened the ball at a very early hour, and\r\nclaimed admittance, in virtue of the notice they had received. The\r\nmaid-servant had only just time to assure them that all the chimneys\r\nwere clean, and their services were not required, when some dozen of\r\ncoal-carts drew up as near as possible to the ill-fated house. New\r\nprotestations, new indignation. The grimy and irate coalheavers were\r\nstill being discoursed with, when a bevy of neat and polite individuals\r\narrived from different quarters, bearing each under his arm a splendid\r\nten-guinea wedding-cake. The maid grew distracted; her mistress was\r\nsingle, and had no intention of doubling herself; there must be some\r\nmistake; the confectioners were dismissed, in a very different humour to\r\nthat with which they had come. But they were scarcely gone when crowds\r\nbegan to storm the house, all 'on business.' Rival doctors met in\r\nastonishment and disgust, prepared for an _accouchement_; undertakers\r\nstared one another mutely in the face, as they deposited at the door\r\ncoffins made to order--elm or oak--so many feet and so many inches; the\r\nclergymen of all the neighbouring parishes, high church or low church,\r\nwere ready to minister to the spiritual wants of the unfortunate\r\nmoribund, but retired in disgust when they found that some forty\r\nfishmongers had been engaged to purvey 'cod's head and lobsters' for a\r\nperson professing to be on the brink of the grave.\r\n\r\nThe street now became the scene of fearful distraction. Furious\r\ntradesmen of every kind were ringing the house-bell, and rapping the\r\nknocker for admittance--such, at least, as could press through the crowd\r\nas far as the house. Bootmakers arrived with Hessians and\r\nWellingtons--'as per order'--or the most delicate of dancing-shoes for\r\nthe sober old lady; haberdashers had brought the last new thing in\r\nevening dress, 'quite the fashion,' and 'very chaste:' hat-makers from\r\nLincoln and Bennett down to the Hebrew vendor in Marylebone Lane,\r\narrived with their crown-pieces; butchers' boys, on stout little nags,\r\ncould not get near enough to deliver the legs of mutton which had been\r\nordered; the lumbering coal-carts 'still stopped the way.' A crowd--the\r\neasiest curiosity in the world to collect--soon gathered round the\r\nmotley mob of butchers, bakers, candlestick-makers, and makers and\r\nsellers of everything else that mortal can want; the mob thronged the\r\npavement, the carts filled the road, and soon the carriages of the noble\r\nof the land dashed up in all the panoply of state, and a demand was made\r\nto clear the way for the Duke of Gloucester, for the Governor of the\r\nBank, the Chairman of the East India Company, and last, but, oh! not\r\nleast, the grandee whose successor the originator of the plot afterwards\r\nso admirably satirized--the great Lord Mayor himself. The consternation,\r\ndisgust, and terror of the elderly female, the delight and chuckling of\r\nTheodore and his accomplices, seated at a window on the opposite side of\r\nthe road, 'can be more easily imagined than described;' but what were\r\nthe feelings of tradesmen, professional men, gentlemen, noblemen, and\r\ngrand officials, who had been summoned from distant spots by artful\r\nlures to No. 54, and there battled with a crowd in vain only to find\r\nthat there were hoaxed; people who had thus lost both time and money,\r\ncan be neither described nor imagined. It was not the idea of the\r\nhoax--simple enough in itself--which was entitled to the admiration\r\naccorded to ingenuity, but its extent and success, and the clever means\r\ntaken by the conspirators to insure the attendance of every one who\r\nought not to have been there. It was only late at night that the police\r\nsucceeded in clearing the street, and the dupes retired, murmuring and\r\nvowing vengeance. Hook, however, gloried in the exploit, which he\r\nthought 'perfect.'\r\n\r\nBut the hoaxing dearest to Theodore--for there was something to be\r\ngained by it---was that by which he managed to obtain a dinner when\r\neither too hard-up to pay for one, or in the humour for a little\r\namusement. No one who has not lived as a bachelor in London and been\r\nreduced---in respect of coin--to the sum of twopence-halfpenny, can tell\r\nhow excellent a strop is hunger to sharpen wit upon. We all know that\r\n\r\n  'Mortals with stomachs can't live without dinner;'\r\n\r\nand in Hook's day the substitute of 'heavy teas' was not invented.\r\nNecessity is very soon brought to bed, when a man puts his fingers into\r\nhis pockets, finds them untenanted, and remembers that the only friend\r\nwho would consent to lend him five shillings is gone out of town; and\r\nthe infant, Invention, presently smiles into the nurse's face. But it\r\nwas no uncommon thing in those days for gentlemen to invite themselves\r\nwhere they listed, and stay as long as they liked. It was only necessary\r\nfor them to make themselves really agreeable, and deceive their host in\r\nsome way or other. Hook's friend, little Tom Hill, of whom it was said\r\nthat he knew everybody's affairs far better than they did themselves,\r\nwas famous for examining kitchens about the hour of dinner, and quietly\r\nselecting his host according to the odour of the viands. It is of him\r\nthat the old 'Joe Miller' is told of the 'haunch of venison.' Invited to\r\ndinner at one house, he _happens_ to glance down into the kitchen of the\r\nnext, and seeing a tempting haunch of venison on the spit, throws over\r\nthe inviter, and ingratiates himself with his neighbour, who ends by\r\nasking him to stay to dinner. The fare, however, consisted of nothing\r\nmore luxurious than an Irish stew, and the disappointed guest was\r\ninformed that he had been 'too cunning by half,' inasmuch as the venison\r\nbelonged to his original inviter, and had been cooked in the house he\r\nwas in by kind permission, because the chimney of the owner's kitchen\r\nsmoked.\r\n\r\nThe same principle often actuated Theodore; and, indeed, there are few\r\nstories which can be told of this characteristic of the great frolicker,\r\nwhich have not been told a century of times.\r\n\r\nFor instance: two young men are strolling, towards 5 P.M., in the then\r\nfashionable neighbourhood of Soho; the one is Terry, the actor--the\r\nother, Hook, the actor, for surely he deserves the title. They pass a\r\nhouse, and sniff the viands cooking underground. Hook quietly announces\r\nhis intention of dining _there_. He enters, is admitted and announced by\r\nthe servant, mingles with the company, and is quite at home before he is\r\nperceived by the host. At last the _dénouement_ came; the dinner-giver\r\napproached the stranger, and with great politeness asked his name.\r\n'Smith' was, of course, the reply, and reverting to mistakes made by\r\nservants in announcing, &c., 'Smith' hurried off into an amusing story,\r\nto put his host in good humour. The conversation that followed is taken\r\nfrom 'Ingoldsby':--\r\n\r\n'But, really, my dear sir,' the host put in, 'I think the mistake on the\r\npresent occasion does not originate in the source you allude to; I\r\ncertainly did not anticipate the honour of Mr. Smith's company to-day.'\r\n\r\n'No, I dare say not. You said _four_ in your note, I know, and it is\r\nnow, I see, a quarter past five; but the fact is, I have been detained\r\nin the City, as I was going to explain--'\r\n\r\n'Pray,' said the host, 'whom do you suppose you are addressing?'\r\n\r\n'Whom? why Mr. Thompson, of course, old friend of my father. I have not\r\nthe pleasure, indeed, of being personally known to you, but having\r\nreceived your kind invitation yesterday,' &c. &c.\r\n\r\n'No, sir, my name is not Thompson, but Jones,' in highly indignant\r\naccents.\r\n\r\n'Jones!' was the well-acted answer: 'why, surely, I cannot have--yes I\r\nmust--good heaven! I see it all. My _dear_ sir, what an unfortunate\r\nblunder; wrong house--what must you think of such an intrusion? I am\r\nreally at a loss for words in which to apologize; you will permit me to\r\nretire at present, and to-morrow--'\r\n\r\n'Pray, don't think of retiring,' rejoined the host, taken with the\r\nappearance and manner of the young man. 'Your friend's table must have\r\nbeen cleared long ago, if, as you say, four was the hour named, and I am\r\ntoo happy to be able to offer you a seat at mine.'\r\n\r\nIt may be easily conceived that the invitation had not to be very often\r\nrepeated, and Hook kept the risible muscles of the company upon the\r\nconstant stretch, and paid for the entertainment in the only coin with\r\nwhich he was well supplied.\r\n\r\nThere was more wit, however, in his visit to a retired watchmaker, who\r\nhad got from government a premium of £10,000 for the best chronometer.\r\nHook was very partial to journeys in search of adventure; a gig, a\r\nlively companion, and sixpence for the first turnpike being generally\r\nall that was requisite; ingenuity supplied the rest. It was on one of\r\nthese excursions, that Hook and his friend found themselves in the\r\nneighbourhood of Uxbridge, with a horse and a gig, and not a sixpence to\r\nbe found in any pocket. Now a horse and gig are property, but of what\r\nuse is a valuable of which you cannot dispose or deposit at a\r\npawnbroker's, while you are prevented proceeding on your way by that\r\nneat white gate with the neat white box of a house at its side? The only\r\nalternative left to the young men was to drive home again, dinnerless, a\r\ndistance of twenty miles, with a jaded horse, or to find gratuitous\r\naccommodation for man and beast. In such a case Sheridan would simply\r\nhave driven to the first inn, and by persuasion or stratagem contrived\r\nto elude payment, after having drunk the best wine and eaten the best\r\ndinner the house could afford. Hook was really more refined, as well as\r\nbolder in his pillaging.\r\n\r\nThe villa of the retired tradesman was perceived, and the gig soon drew\r\nup before the door. The strangers were ushered in to the watchmaker, and\r\nHook, with great politeness and a serious respectful look, addressed\r\nhim. He said that he felt he was taking a great liberty--so he was--but\r\nthat he could not pass the door of a man who had done the country so\r\nmuch service by the invention of what must prove the most useful and\r\nvaluable instrument, without expressing to him the gratitude which he,\r\nas a British subject devoted to his country's good, could not but feel\r\ntowards the inventor, &c. &c. The flattery was so delicately and so\r\nseriously insinuated, that the worthy citizen could only receive it as\r\nan honest expression of sincere admiration. The Rubicon was passed; a\r\nlittle lively conversation, artfully made attractive by Hook, followed,\r\nand the watchmaker was more and more gratified. He felt, too, what an\r\nhonour it would be to entertain two real gentlemen, and remarking that\r\nthey were far from town, brought out at last the longed-for invitation,\r\nwhich was, of course, declined as out of the question. Thereupon the old\r\ngentleman became pressing: the young strangers were at last prevailed\r\nupon to accept it, and very full justice they did to the larder and\r\ncellar of the successful chronometer-maker.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very original in the act of hoaxing, and Hook's way of\r\ngetting a hackney-coach without paying for it, was, perhaps, suggested\r\nby Sheridan's, but was more laughable. Finding himself in the vehicle,\r\nand knowing that there was nothing either in his purse or at home to pay\r\nthe fare, he cast about for expedients, and at last remembered the\r\naddress of an eminent surgeon in the neighbourhood. He ordered the\r\ncoachman to drive to his house and knock violently at the door, which\r\nwas no sooner opened than Hook rushed in, terribly agitated, demanded to\r\nsee the doctor, to whom in a few incoherent and agitated sentences, he\r\ngave to understand that his wife needed his services, immediately, being\r\non the point of becoming a mother.\r\n\r\n'I will start directly,' replied the surgeon; 'I will order my carriage\r\nat once.'\r\n\r\n'But, my dear sir, there is not a moment to spare. I have a coach at the\r\ndoor, jump into that.'\r\n\r\nThe surgeon obeyed. The name and address given were those of a\r\nmiddle-aged spinster of the most rigid virtue. We can imagine her\r\nindignation, and how sharply she rung the bell, when the surgeon had\r\ndelicately explained the object of his visit, and how eagerly he took\r\nrefuge in the coach. Hook had, of course, walked quietly away in the\r\nmeantime, and the Galenite had to pay the demand of Jehu.\r\n\r\nThe hoaxing stories of Theodore Hook are numberless. Hoaxing was the\r\nfashion of the day, and a childish fashion too. Charles Mathews, whose\r\nface possessed the flexibility of an acrobat's body, and who could\r\nassume any character or disguise on the shortest notice, was his great\r\nconfederate in these plots. The banks of the Thames were their great\r\nresort. At one point there was Mathews talking gibberish in a disguise\r\nintended to represent the Spanish Ambassador, and actually deceiving the\r\nWoolwich authorities by his clever impersonation. At another, there was\r\nHook landing uninvited with his friends upon the well-known,\r\nsleek-looking lawn of a testy little gentleman, drawing out a note-book\r\nand talking so authoritatively about the survey for a canal, to be\r\nundertaken by Government, that the owner of the lawn becomes frightened,\r\nand in his anxiety attempts to conciliate the mighty self-made official\r\nby the offer of dinner--of course accepted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEODORE HOOK'S ENGINEERING FROLIC.]\r\n\r\nThen the _Arcades ambo_ show off their jesting tricks at Croydon fair, a\r\nmost suitable place for them. On one occasion Hook personates a madman,\r\naccusing Mathews, 'his brother,' of keeping him out of his rights and in\r\nhis custody. The whole fair collects around them, and begins to\r\nsympathise with Hook, who begs them to aid in his escape from his\r\n'brother.' A sham escape and sham capture take place, and the party\r\nadjourn to the inn, where Mathews, who had been taken by surprise by the\r\nnew part suddenly played by his confederate, seized upon a hearse, which\r\ndrew up before the inn, on its return from a funeral, persuaded the\r\ncompany to bind the 'madman,' who was now becoming furious, and who\r\nwould have deposited him in the gloomy vehicle, if he had not succeeded\r\nin snapping his fetters, and so escaped. In short, they were two boys,\r\nwith the sole difference, that they had sufficient talent and experience\r\nof the world to maintain admirably the parts they assumed.\r\n\r\nBut a far more famous and more admirable talent in Theodore than that of\r\ndeception was that of improvising. The art of improvising belongs to\r\nItaly and the Tyrol. The wonderful gift of ready verse to express\r\nsatire, and ridicule, seems, as a rule, to be confined to the\r\ninhabitants of those two lands. Others are, indeed, scattered over the\r\nworld, who possess this gift, but very sparsely. Theodore Hook stands\r\nalmost alone in this country as an improviser. Yet to judge of such of\r\nhis verses as have been preserved, taken down from memory or what not,\r\nthe grand effect of them--and no doubt it _was_ grand--must have been\r\nowing more to his manner and his acting, than to any intrinsic value in\r\nthe verses themselves, which are, for the most part, slight, and devoid\r\nof actual wit, though abounding in puns. Sheridan's testimony to the\r\nwonderful powers of the man is, perhaps, more valuable than that of any\r\none else, for he was a good judge both of verse and of wit. One of\r\nHook's earliest displays of his talent was at a dinner given by the\r\nDrury Lane actors to Sheridan at the Piazza Coffee House in 1808. Here,\r\nas usual, Hook sat down to the piano, and touching off a few chords,\r\ngave verse after verse on all the events of the entertainment, on each\r\nperson present, though he now saw many of them for the first time, and\r\non anything connected with the matters of interest before them. Sheridan\r\nwas delighted, and declared that he could not have believed such a\r\nfaculty possible if he had not witnessed its effects: that no\r\ndescription 'could have convinced him of so peculiar an instance of\r\ngenius,' and so forth.\r\n\r\nOne of his most extraordinary efforts in this line is related by Mr.\r\nJerdan. A dinner was given by Mansell Reynolds to Lockhart, Luttrell,\r\nColeridge, Hook, Tom Hill, and others. The grown-up schoolboys, pretty\r\nfar gone in Falernian, of a home-made, and very homely vintage, amused\r\nthemselves by breaking the wine-glasses, till Coleridge was set to\r\ndemolish the last of them with a fork thrown at it from the side of the\r\ntable. Let it not be supposed that any teetotal spirit suggested this\r\ninconoclasm, far from it--the glasses were too small, and the poets, the\r\nwits, the punsters, the jesters, preferred to drink their port out of\r\ntumblers. After dinner Hook gave one of his songs which satirized\r\nsuccessively, and successfully, each person present. He was then\r\nchallenged to improvise on any given subject, and by way of one as far\r\ndistant from poetry as could be, _cocoa-nut oil_ was fixed upon.\r\nTheodore accepted the challenge; and after a moment's consideration\r\nbegan his lay with a description of the Mauritius, which he knew so\r\nwell, the negroes dancing round the cocoa-nut tree, the process of\r\nextracting the oil, and so forth, all in excellent rhyme and rhythm, if\r\nnot actual poetry. Then came the voyage to England, hits at the Italian\r\nwarehousemen, and so on, till the oil is brought into the very lamp\r\nbefore them in that very room, to show them with the light it feeds and\r\nmake them able to break wine-glasses and get drunk from tumblers. This\r\nwe may be sure Hook himself did, for one, and the rest were probably not\r\nmuch behind him.\r\n\r\nIn late life this gift of Hook's--improvising I mean, not getting\r\nintoxicated--was his highest recommendation in society, and at the same\r\ntime his bane. Like Sheridan, he was ruined by his wonderful natural\r\npowers. It can well be imagined that to improvise in the manner in which\r\nHook did it, and at a moment's notice, required some effort of the\r\nintellect. This effort became greater as circumstances depressed his\r\nspirits more and more and yet with every care upon his mind, he was\r\nexpected, wherever he went, to amuse the guests with a display of his\r\ntalent. He could not do so without stimulants, and rather than give up\r\nsociety, fell into habits of drinking, which hastened his death.\r\n\r\nWe have thrown together the foregoing anecdotes of Hook, irrespective of\r\ntime, in order to show what the man's gifts were, and what his title to\r\nbe considered a wit. We must proceed more steadily to a review of his\r\nlife. Successful as Hook had proved as a writer for the stage, he\r\nsuddenly and without any sufficient cause rushed off into another branch\r\nof literature, that of novel-writing. His first attempt in this kind of\r\nfiction was 'The Man of Sorrow,' published under the _nom de plume_ of\r\n_Alfred Allendale_. This was not, as its name would seem to imply, a\r\nnovel of pathetic cast, but the history of a gentleman whose life from\r\nbeginning to end is rendered wretched by a succession of mishaps of the\r\nmost ludicrous but improbable kind. Indeed Theodore's novels, like his\r\nstage-pieces, are gone out of date in an age so practical that even in\r\nromance it will not allow of the slightest departure from reality. Their\r\nvery style was ephemeral, and their interest could not outlast the\r\ngeneration to amuse which they were penned. This first novel was written\r\nwhen Hook was one-and-twenty. Soon after he was sent to Oxford, where he\r\nhad been entered at St. Mary's Hall, more affectionately known by the\r\nnickname of 'Skimmery.' No selection could have been worse. Skimmery\r\nwas, at that day, and, until quite recently, a den of thieves, where\r\nyoung men of fortune and folly submitted to be pillaged in return for\r\nbeing allowed perfect licence, as much to eat as they could possibly\r\nswallow, and far more to drink than was at all good for them. It has\r\nrequired all the enterprise of the present excellent Principal to\r\nconvert it into a place of sober study. It was then the most\r\n'gentlemanly' residence in Oxford; for a gentleman in those days meant a\r\nman who did nothing, spent his own or his father's guineas with a\r\nbrilliant indifference to consequences, and who applied his mind solely\r\nto the art of frolic. It was the very place where Hook would be\r\nencouraged instead of restrained in his natural propensities, and had he\r\nremained there he would probably have ruined himself and his father long\r\nbefore he had put on the sleeves.\r\n\r\nAt the matriculation itself he gave a specimen of his 'fun.'\r\n\r\nWhen asked, according to the usual form, 'if he was willing to sign the\r\nThirty-nine Articles,' he replied, 'Certainly, sir, _forty_ if you\r\nplease.' The gravity of the stern Vice-Chancellor was upset, but as no\r\nOxford Don can ever pardon a joke, however good, Master Theodore was\r\nvery nearly being dismissed, had not his brother, by this time a\r\nPrebendary of Winchester, and 'an honour to his college, sir,'\r\ninterceded in his favour.\r\n\r\nThe night before, he had given a still better specimen of his\r\neffrontery. He had picked up a number of old Harrovians, with whom he\r\nhad repaired to a tavern for song, supper, and sociability, and as usual\r\nin such cases, in the lap of Alma Mater, the babes became sufficiently\r\nintoxicated, and not a little uproarious. Drinking in a tavern is\r\nforbidden by Oxonian statutes, and one of the proctors happening to pass\r\nin the street outside, was attracted into the house by the sound of\r\nsomewhat unscholastic merriment. The effect can be imagined. All the\r\nyouths were in absolute terror, except Theodore, and looked in vain for\r\nsome way to escape. The wary and faithful 'bulldogs' guarded the\r\ndoorway; the marshal, predecessor of the modern omniscient Brown,\r\nadvanced respectfully behind the proctor into the room, and passing a\r\npenetrating glance from one youth to the other, all of whom--except\r\nTheodore again--he knew by sight--for that is the pride and pleasure of\r\na marshal--mentally registered their names in secret hopes of getting\r\nhalf-a-crown a-piece to forget them again.\r\n\r\nNo mortal is more respectful in his manner of accosting you than an\r\nOxford proctor, for he may make a mistake, and a mistake may make him\r\nvery miserable. When, for instance, a highly respectable lady was the\r\nother day lodged, in spite of protestations, in the 'Procuratorial\r\nRooms,' and there locked up on suspicion of being somebody very\r\ndifferent, the over-zealous proctor who had ordered her incarceration\r\nwas sued for damages for £300, and had to pay them too! Therefore the\r\ngentleman in question most graciously and suavely inquired of Mr.\r\nTheodore Hook--\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon, sir, but are you a member of this university?'--the\r\nusual form.\r\n\r\n'No, sir, I am not. Are you?'\r\n\r\nThe suavity at once changed to grave dignity. The proctor lifted up the\r\nhem of his garment, which being of broad velvet, with the selvage on it,\r\nwas one of the insignia of his office, and sternly said,--'You see this,\r\nsir.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said Hook, cool as ever, and quietly feeling the material, which\r\nhe examined with apparent interest, 'I see; Manchester velvet: and may I\r\ntake the liberty, sir, of inquiring how much you have paid per yard for\r\nthe article?'\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter from all present burst forth with such vehemence that\r\nit shot the poor official, red with suppressed anger, into the street\r\nagain, and the merrymakers continued their bout till the approach of\r\nmidnight, when they were obliged to return to their respective colleges.\r\n\r\nHad Theodore proceeded in this way for several terms, no doubt the\r\noutraged authorities would have added his name to the list of the great\r\nmen whom they have expelled from time to time most unprophetically. As\r\nit was, he soon left the groves of Academus, and sought those of Fashion\r\nin town. His matriculation into this new university was much more\r\nauspicious; he was hailed in society as already fit to take a degree of\r\nbachelor of his particular arts, and ere long his improvising, his fun,\r\nhis mirth--as yet natural and over-boiling--his wicked punning, and his\r\ntender wickedness, induced the same institution to offer him the grade\r\nof 'Master' of those arts. In after years he rose to be even 'Doctor,'\r\nand many, perhaps, were the minds diseased to which his well-known mirth\r\nministered.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period that some of his talents were displayed in the\r\nmanner we have described, though his great fame as an improvisatore was\r\nestablished more completely in later days. Yet he had already made\r\nhimself a name in that species of wit--not a very high one--which found\r\nfavour with the society of that period. We allude to imitation, 'taking\r\noff,' and punning. The last contemptible branch of wit-making, now\r\nhappily confined to 'Punch,' is as old as variety of language. It is not\r\npossible with simple vocabularies, and accordingly is seldom met with in\r\npurely-derived languages. Yet we have Roman and Greek puns; and English\r\nis peculiarly adapted to this childish exercise, because, being made up\r\nof several languages, it necessarily contains many words which are like\r\nin sound and unlike in meaning. Punning is, in fact, the vice of English\r\nwit, the temptation of English mirth-makers, and, at last, we trust, the\r\nscorn of English good sense. But in Theodore's day it held a high place,\r\nand men who had no real wit about them could twist and turn words and\r\ncombinations of words with great ingenuity and much readiness, to the\r\ndelight of their listeners. Pun-making was a fashion among the\r\nconversationists of that day, and took the place of better wit. Hook was\r\na disgraceful punster, and a successful one. He strung puns together by\r\nthe score--nothing more easy--in his improvised songs and conversation.\r\nTake an instance from his quiz on the march of intellect:--\r\n\r\n  'Hackney-coachmen from _Swift_ shall reply, if you feel\r\n    Annoyed at being needlessly shaken;\r\n  And butchers, of course, be flippant from _Steele_,\r\n    And pig-drivers well versed in _Bacon_.\r\n  From _Locke_ shall the blacksmiths authority brave,\r\n    And gas-men cite _Coke_ at discretion;\r\n  Undertakers talk _Gay_ as they go to the _grave_,\r\n    And watermen _Rowe_ by profession.'\r\n\r\nI have known a party of naturally stupid people produce a whole century\r\nof puns one after another, on any subject that presented itself, and I\r\nam inclined to think that nothing can, at the same time, be more\r\nnauseous, or more destructive to real wit. Yet Theodore's strength lay\r\nin puns, and when shorn of them, the Philistines might well laugh at his\r\nwant of strength. Surely his title to wit does not lie in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHowever, he amused, and that gratis; and an amusing man makes his way\r\nanywhere if he have only sufficient tact not to abuse his privileges.\r\nHook grew great in London society for a time, and might have grown\r\ngreater if a change had not come.\r\n\r\nHe had supported himself, up to 1812, almost entirely by his pen: and\r\nthe goose-quill is rarely a staff, though it may sometimes be a\r\nwalking-stick. It was clear that he needed--what so many of us need and\r\ncannot get--a certainty. Happy fellow! he might have begged for an\r\nappointment for years in vain, as many another does, but it fell into\r\nhis lap, no one knows how, and at four-and-twenty Mr. Theodore Edward\r\nHook was made treasurer to the Island of Mauritius, with a salary of\r\n£2,000 per annum. This was not to be, and was not, despised. In spite of\r\nclimate, mosquitoes, and so forth, Hook took the money and sailed.\r\n\r\nWe have no intention of entering minutely upon his conduct in this\r\noffice, which has nothing to do with his character as a wit. There are a\r\nthousand and one reasons for believing him guilty of the charges brought\r\nagainst him, and a thousand and one for supposing him guiltless. Here\r\nwas a young man, gay, jovial, given to society entirely, and not at all\r\nto arithmetic, put into a very trying and awkward position--native\r\nclerks who would cheat if they could, English governors who would find\r\nfault if they could, a disturbed treasury, an awkward currency, liars\r\nfor witnesses, and undeniable evidence of defalcation. In a word, an\r\nexamination was made into the state of the treasury of the island, and a\r\nlarge deficit found. It remained to trace it home to its original\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nHook had not acquired the best character in the island. Those who know\r\nthe official dignity of a small British colony can well understand how\r\nhis pleasantries must have shocked those worthy big-wigs who, exalted\r\nfrom Pump Court, Temple, or Paradise Row, Old Brompton, to places of\r\nhonour and high salaries, rode their high horses with twice the\r\nexclusiveness of those 'to the manner born.' For instance, Hook was\r\nonce, by a mere chance, obliged to take the chair at an official dinner,\r\non which occasion the toasts proposed by the chairman were to be\r\naccompanied by a salute from guns without. Hook went through the list,\r\nand seemed to enjoy toast-drinking so much that he was quite sorry to\r\nhave come to the end of it, and continued, as if still from the list, to\r\npropose successively the health of each officer present. The gunners\r\nwere growing quite weary, but having their orders, dared not complain.\r\nHook was delighted, and went on to the amazement and amusement of all\r\nwho were not tired of the noise, each youthful sub, taken by surprise,\r\nbeing quite gratified at the honour done him. At last there was no one\r\nleft to toast; but the wine had taken effect, and Hook, amid roars of\r\nlaughter inside, and roars of savage artillery without, proposed the\r\nhealth of the waiter who had so ably officiated. This done, he bethought\r\nhim of the cook, who was sent for to return thanks; but the artillery\r\nofficer had by this time got wind of the affair, and feeling that more\r\nthan enough powder had been wasted on the health of gentlemen who were\r\ndetermined to destroy it by the number of their potations, took on\r\nhimself the responsibility of ordering the gunners to stop.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he incurred the displeasure of the governor, General\r\nHall, by fighting a duel--fortunately as harmless as that of Moore and\r\nJeffrey--\r\n\r\n  'When Little's leadless pistol met his eye,\r\n  And Bow-street myrmidons stood laughing by,'\r\n\r\nas Byron says. The governor was sensible enough to wish to put down the\r\n'Gothic appeal to arms,' and was therefore the more irate.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances must be taken into consideration in Hook's favour in\r\nexamining the charge of embezzlement. It must also be stated that the\r\ninformation of the deficit was sent in a letter to the governor by a man\r\nnamed Allan, chief clerk in the Treasury, who had, for irregular\r\nconduct, been already threatened with dismissal. Allan had admitted that\r\nhe had known of the deficit for fifteen months, and yet he had not, till\r\nhe was himself in trouble, thought of making it known to the proper\r\nauthorities. Before his examination, which of course followed, could be\r\nconcluded, Allan committed suicide. Now, does it not, on the face of it,\r\nseem of the highest probability that this man was the real delinquent,\r\nand that knowing that Hook had all the responsibility, and having taken\r\nfair precautions against his own detection, he had anticipated a\r\ndiscovery of the affair by a revelation, incriminating the treasurer?\r\n_Quien sabe_;--dead men tell no tales.\r\n\r\nThe chest, however, was examined, and the deficit found far greater yet\r\nthan had been reported. Hook could not explain, could not understand it\r\nat all; but if not criminal, he had necessarily been careless. He was\r\narrested, thrown into prison, and by the first vessel despatched to\r\nEngland to take his trial, his property of every kind having been sold\r\nfor the Government. Hook, in utter destitution, might be supposed to\r\nhave lost his usual spirits, but he could not resist a joke. At St.\r\nHelena he met an old friend going out to the Cape, who, surprised at\r\nseeing him on his return voyage after a residence of only five years,\r\nsaid: 'I hope you are not going home for your health.'--'Why,' said\r\nTheodore, 'I am sorry to say they think there is something wrong in the\r\n_chest._ Something wrong in the chest' became henceforward the ordinary\r\nphrase in London society in referring to Hook's scrape.\r\n\r\nArrived in England, he was set free, the Government here having decided\r\nthat he could not be criminally tried; and thus Hook, guilty or not, had\r\nbeen ruined and disgraced for life for simple carelessness. True, the\r\ncustody of a nation's property makes negligence almost criminal; but\r\nthat does not excuse the punishment of a man before he is tried.\r\n\r\nHe was summoned, however, to the Colonial Audit Board, where he\r\nunderwent a trying examination; after which he was declared to be in the\r\ndebt of Government: a writ of extent was issued against him; nine months\r\nwere passed in that delightful place of residence--a Sponging-house,\r\nwhich he then exchanged for the 'Rules of the Bench'--the only rules\r\nwhich have no exception. From these he was at last liberated, in 1825,\r\non the understanding that he was to repay the money to Government if at\r\nany time he should be in a position to do so.\r\n\r\nHis liberation was a tacit acknowledgment of his innocence of the charge\r\nof robbery; his encumberment with a debt caused by another's\r\ndelinquencies was, we presume, a signification of his responsibility and\r\nsome kind of punishment for his carelessness. Certainly it was hard upon\r\nHook, that, if innocent, he should not have gone forth without a stain\r\non his character for honesty; and it was unjust, that, if guilty, he\r\nshould not have been punished. The judgment was one of those compromises\r\nwith stern justice which are seldom satisfactory to either party.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that, guilty or not guilty, Hook had been both incompetent\r\nand inconsiderate. Doubtless he congratulated himself highly on\r\nreceiving, at the age of twenty-five, an appointment worth £2,000 a year\r\nin the paradise of the world; but how short-sighted his satisfaction,\r\nsince this very appointment left him some ten years later a pauper to\r\nbegin life anew with an indelible stain on his character. It was absurd\r\nto give so young a man such a post; but it was absolutely wrong in Hook\r\nnot to do his utmost to carry out his duties properly. Nay, he had\r\ntrifled with the public money in the same liberal--perhaps a _more_\r\nliberal--spirit as if it had been his own--made advances and loans here\r\nand there injudiciously, and taken little heed of the consequences.\r\nProbably, at this day, the common opinion acquits Hook of a designed and\r\ncomplicated fraud; but common opinion never did acquit him of\r\nmisconduct, and even by his friends this affair was looked upon with a\r\nsuspicion that preferred silence to examination.\r\n\r\nBut why take such pains to exonerate Hook from a charge of robbery, when\r\nhe was avowedly guilty of as bad a sin, of which the law took no\r\ncognizance, and which society forgave far more easily than it could have\r\ndone for robbing the State? Soon after his return from the Mauritius, he\r\ntook lodgings in the cheap, but unfashionable neighbourhood of Somers\r\nTown. Here, in the moment of his misfortune, when doubting whether\r\ndisgrace, imprisonment, or what not awaited him, he sought solace in the\r\naffection of a young woman, of a class certainly much beneath his, and\r\nof a character unfit to make her a valuable companion to him. Hook had\r\nreceived little moral training, and had he done so, his impulses were\r\nsufficiently strong to overcome any amount of principle. With this\r\nperson--to use the modern slang which seems to convert a glaring sin\r\ninto a social misdemeanour--'he formed a connection.' In other words, he\r\ndestroyed her virtue. Hateful as such an act is, we must, before we can\r\ncondemn a man for it without any recommendation to mercy, consider a\r\nscore of circumstances which have rendered the temptation stronger, and\r\nthe result almost involuntary. Hook was not a man of high moral\r\ncharacter--very far from it--but we need not therefore suppose that he\r\nsat down coolly and deliberately, like a villain in a novel, to effect\r\nthe girl's ruin. But the Rubicon once passed, how difficult is the\r\nretreat! There are but two paths open to a man, who would avoid living a\r\nlife of sin: the one, to marry his victim; the other, to break off the\r\nconnection before it is too late. The first is, of course, the more\r\nproper course; but there are cases where marriage is impossible. From\r\nthe latter a man of any heart must shrink with horror. Yet there _are_\r\ncases, even, where the one sin will prove the least--where she who has\r\nloved too well may grieve bitterly at parting, yet will be no more open\r\nto temptation than if she had never fallen. Such cases are rare, and it\r\nis not probable that the young person with whom Hook had become\r\nconnected would have retrieved the fatal error. She became a mother, and\r\nthere was no retreat. It is clear that Hook ought to have married her.\r\nIt is evident that he was selfish and wrong not to do so;--yet he shrank\r\nfrom it, weakly, wickedly, and he was punished for his shrinking. He had\r\nsufficient feeling not to throw his victim over, yet he was content to\r\nlive a life of sin, and to keep her in such a life. This is perhaps the\r\nblackest stain on Hook's character. When Fox married, in consequence of\r\na similar connection, he 'settled down,' retrieved his early errors, and\r\nbecame a better man, morally, than he had ever been. Hook _ought_ to\r\nhave married. It was the cowardly dread of public opinion that deterred\r\nhim from doing so, and, in consequence, he was never happy, and felt\r\nthat this connection was a perpetual burden to him.\r\n\r\nWrecked and ruined, Hook had no resource but his literary talents, and\r\nit is to be deplored that he should have prostituted these to serve an\r\nungentlemanly and dishonourable party in their onslaught upon an\r\nunfortunate woman. Whatever may be now thought of the queen of 'the\r\ngreatest gentleman'--or _roue_--of Europe, those who hunted her down\r\nwill never be pardoned, and Hook was one of those. We have cried out\r\nagainst an Austrian general for condemning a Hungarian lady to the lash,\r\nand we have seen, with delight, a mob chase him through the streets of\r\nLondon and threaten his very life. But we have not only pardoned, but\r\neven praised, our favourite wit for far worse conduct than this. Even if\r\nwe allow, which we do not, chat the queen was one half as bad as her\r\nenemies, or rather her husband's parasites, would make her out, we\r\ncannot forgive the men who, shielded by their incognito, and perfectly\r\nfree from danger of any kind, set upon a woman with libels, invectives,\r\nballads, epigrams, and lampoons, which a lady could scarcely read, and\r\nof which a royal lady, and many an English gentlewoman, too, were the\r\nbutts.\r\n\r\nThe vilest of all the vile papers of that day was the 'John Bull,' now\r\nsettled down to a quiet periodical. Perhaps the real John Bull, heavy,\r\ngood-natured lumberer as he is, was never worse represented than in this\r\njournal which bore his name, but had little of his kindly spirit. Hook\r\nwas its originator, and for a long time its main supporter. Scurrility,\r\nscandal, libel, baseness of all kinds formed the fuel with which it\r\nblazed, and the wit, bitter, unflinching, unsparing, which puffed the\r\nflame up, was its chief recommendation.\r\n\r\nNo more disgraceful climax was ever reached by a disgraceful dynasty of\r\nprofligates than that which found a King of England--long, as Regent,\r\nthe leader of the profligate and degraded--at war with his injured\r\nQueen. None have deserved better the honest gratitude of their country\r\nthan those who, like Henry Brougham, defended the oppressed woman in\r\nspite of opposition, obloquy, and ridicule.\r\n\r\nBut we need not go deeply into a history so fresh in the minds of all,\r\nas that blot which shows John Bull himself upholding a wretched\r\ndissipated monarch against a wife, who, whatever her faults, was still a\r\nwoman, and whatever her spirit--for she had much of it, and showed it\r\ngrandly at need--was still a lady. Suffice it to say that 'John Bull'\r\nwas the most violent of the periodicals that attacked her, and that\r\nTheodore Hook, no Puritan himself, was the principal writer in that\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nIf you can imagine 'Punch' turned Conservative, incorporated in one\r\npaper with the 'Morning Herald,' so that a column of news was printed\r\nside by side with one of a jocular character, and these two together\r\ndevoted without principle to the support of a party, the attack of\r\nWhiggism, and an unblushing detraction of the character of one of our\r\nprincesses, you can form some idea of what 'John Bull' was in those\r\ndays. There is, however, a difference: 'Punch' attacks public\r\ncharacters, and ridicules public events; 'John Bull' dragged out the\r\nmost retired from their privacy, and attacked them with calumnies for\r\nwhich, often, there was no foundation. Then, again, 'Punch' is not\r\nnearly so bitter as was 'John Bull:' there is not in the 'London\r\nCharivari' a determination to say everything that spite can invent\r\nagainst any particular set or party; there is a good nature, still, in\r\nmaster 'Punch.' It was quite the reverse in 'John Bull,' established for\r\none purpose, and devoted to that. Yet the wit in Theodore's paper does\r\nnot rise much higher than that of our modern laughing philosopher.\r\n\r\nOf Hook's contributions the most remarkable was the 'Ramsbottom\r\nLetters,' in which Mrs. Lavinia Dorothea Ramsbottom describes all the\r\n_memory billions_ of her various tours at home and abroad, always, of\r\ncourse, with more or less allusion to political affairs. The 'fun' of\r\nthese letters is very inferior to that of 'Jeames' or of the 'Snob\r\nPapers,' and consists more in Malaprop absurdities and a wide range of\r\nbad puns, than in any real wit displayed in them. Of the style of both,\r\nwe take an extract anywhere:--\r\n\r\n'Oh! Mr. Bull, Room is raley a beautiful place. We entered it by the\r\nPoint of Molly, which is just like the Point and Sally at Porchmouth,\r\nonly they call Sally there Port, which is not known in Room. The Tiber\r\nis a nice river, it looks yellow, but it does the same there as the\r\nThames does here. We hired a carry-lettz and a cocky-olly, to take us to\r\nthe Church of Salt Peter, which is prodigious big; in the centre of the\r\npizarro there is a basilisk very high, on the right and left two\r\nhandsome foundlings; and the farcy, as Mr. Fulmer called it, is\r\nornamented with collateral statutes of some of the Apostates.'\r\n\r\nWe can quite imagine that Hook wrote many of these letters when excited\r\nby wine. Some are laughable enough, but the majority are so deplorably\r\nstupid, reeking with puns and scurrility, that when the temporary\r\ninterest was gone, there was nothing left to attract the reader. It is\r\nscarcely possible to laugh at the Joe-Millerish mistakes, the old world\r\npuns, and the trite stories of Hook 'remains.' Remains! indeed; they had\r\nbetter have remained where they were.\r\n\r\nBesides prose of this kind, Hook contributed various jingles--there is\r\nno other name for them--arranged to popular tunes, and intended to\r\nbecome favourites with the country people. These like the prose\r\neffusions, served the purpose of an hour, and have no interest now.\r\nWhether they were ever really popular remains to be proved. Certes, they\r\nare forgotten now, and long since even in the most Conservative corners\r\nof the country. Many of these have the appearance of having been\r\noriginally _recitati_, and their amusement must have depended chiefly on\r\nthe face and manner of the singer--Hook himself; but in some he\r\ndisplayed that vice of rhyming which has often made nonsense go down,\r\nand which is tolerable only when introduced in the satire of a 'Don\r\nJuan' or the first-rate mimicry of 'Rejected Addresses.' Hook had a most\r\nwonderful facility in concocting out-of-the-way rhymes, and a few verses\r\nfrom his song on Clubs will suffice for a good specimen of his talent:--\r\n\r\n  'If any man loves comfort, and has little cash to buy it, he\r\n    Should get into a crowded club--a most select society;\r\n  While solitude and mutton-cutlets serve _infelix uxor_, he\r\n    May have his club (Like Hercules), and revel there in luxury.\r\n                                                    Bow, wow, wow, &c.\r\n\r\n  'Yes, clubs knock houses on the head; e'en Hatchett's can't demolish\r\n                them;\r\n    Joy grieves to see their magnitude, and Long longs to abolish them.\r\n  The inns are out; hotels for single men scarce keep alive on it;\r\n    While none but houses that are in the family way thrive on it.\r\n                                                    Bow, wow, wow, &c.\r\n\r\n  'There's first the Athenaeum Club, so wise, there's not a man of it,\r\n    That has not sense enough for six (in fact, that is the plan of it);\r\n  The very waiters answer you with eloquence Socratical;\r\n    And always place the knives and forks in order mathematical.\r\n                                                    Bow, wow, wow, &c.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'E'en Isis has a house in town, and Cam abandons her city.\r\n  The master now hangs out at the Trinity University.\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'The Union Club is quite superb; its best apartment daily is,\r\n  The lounge of lawyers, doctors, merchants, beaux, _cum multis aliis_.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'The Travellers are in Pall Mall, and smoke cigars so cosily,\r\n  And dream they climb the highest Alps, or rove the plains of Moselai.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'These are the stages which all men propose to play their parts upon,\r\n  For _clubs_ are what the Londoners have clearly set their _hearts_\r\n                upon.\r\n        Bow, wow, wow, tiddy-iddy-iddy-iddy, bow, wow, wow, &c.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the harmless ballads of 'Bull.' Some of the political\r\nones are scarcely fit to print in the present day. We cannot wonder that\r\nladies of a certain position gave out that they would not receive any\r\none who took in this paper. It was scurrilous to the last degree, and\r\nTheodore Hook was the soul of it. He preserved his incognito so well,\r\nthat in spite of all attempts to unearth him, it was many years before\r\nhe could be certainly fixed upon as a writer in its columns. He even\r\nwent to the length of writing letters and articles against himself, in\r\norder to disarm suspicion.\r\n\r\nHook now lived and thrived purely on literature. He published many\r\nnovels--gone where the bad novels go, and unread in the present day,\r\nunless in some remote country town, which boasts only a very meagre\r\ncirculating library. Improbability took the place of natural painting in\r\nthem; punning supplied that of better wit; and personal portraiture was\r\nso freely used, that his most intimate friends--old Mathews, for\r\ninstance--did not escape.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hook, making a good fortune, returned to his convivial life,\r\nand the enjoyment--if enjoyment it be--of general society. He 'threw out\r\nhis bow window' on the strength of his success with 'John Bull,' and\r\nspent much more than he had. He mingled freely in all the London circles\r\nof thirty years ago, whose glory is still fresh in the minds of most of\r\nus, and everywhere his talent as an improvisatore, and his\r\nconversational powers, made him a general favourite.\r\n\r\nUnhappy popularity for Hook! He, who was yet deeply in debt to the\r\nnation--who had an illegitimate family to maintain, who owed in many\r\nquarters more than he could ever hope to pay--was still fool enough to\r\nentertain largely, and receive both nobles and wits in the handsomest\r\nmanner. Why did he not live quietly? why not, like Fox, marry the\r\nunhappy woman whom he had made the mother of his children, and content\r\nhimself with trimming vines and rearing tulips? Why, forsooth? because\r\nhe was Theodore Hook, thoughtless and foolish to the last. The jester of\r\nthe people must needs be a fool. Let him take it to his conscience that\r\nhe was not as much a knave.\r\n\r\nIn his latter years Hook took to the two dissipations most likely to\r\nbring him into misery--play and drink. He was utterly unfitted for the\r\nformer, being too gay a spirit to sit down and calculate chances. He\r\nlost considerably, and the more he lost the more he played. Drinking\r\nbecame almost a necessity with him. He had a reputation to keep up in\r\nsociety, and had not the moral courage to retire from it altogether.\r\nWriting, improvising, conviviality, play, demanded stimulants. His mind\r\nwas overworked in every sense. He had recourse to the only remedy, and\r\nin drinking he found a temporary relief from anxiety, and a short-lived\r\nsustenance. There is no doubt that this man, who had amused London\r\ncircles for many years, hastened his end by drinking.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet thirty years since Theodore Hook died. He left the world\r\non August the 24th, 1841, and by this time he remains in the memory of\r\nmen only as a wit that was, a punster, a hoaxer, a sorry jester, with an\r\nample fund of fun, but not as a great man in any way. Allowing\r\neverything for his education--the times he lived in, and the unhappy\r\nerror of his early life--we may admit that Hook was not, in character,\r\nthe worst of the wits. He died in no odour of sanctity, but he was not a\r\nblasphemer or reviler, like others of this class. He ignored the bond of\r\nmatrimony, yet he remained faithful to the woman he had betrayed; he was\r\nundoubtedly careless in the one responsible office with which he was\r\nintrusted, yet he cannot be taxed, taking all in all, with deliberate\r\npeculation. His drinking and playing were bad--very bad. His improper\r\nconnection was bad--very bad; but perhaps the worst feature in his\r\ncareer was his connection with 'John Bull,' and his ready giving in to a\r\nsystem of low libel. There is no excuse for this but the necessity of\r\nliving; but Hook, had he retained any principle, might have made enough\r\nto live upon in a more honest manner. His name does, certainly, not\r\nstand out well among the wits of this country, but after all, since all\r\nwere so bad, Hook may be excused as not being the worst of them.\r\n_Requiescat in pace_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSYDNEY SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 'Wise Wit.'--Oddities of the Father.--Verse-making at Winchester.--\r\nCurate Life on Salisbury Plain.--Old Edinburgh.--Its Social and\r\nArchitectural Features.--Making Love Metaphysically.--The Old Scottish\r\nSupper.--The Men of Mark passing away---The Band of Young Spirits.--\r\nBrougham's Early Tenacity.--Fitting up Conversations.--'Old School'\r\nCeremonies.--The Speculative Society.--A Brilliant Set.--Sydney's Opinion\r\nof his Friends.--Holland House.--Preacher at the 'Foundling.'--Sydney's\r\n'Grammar of Life.'--The Picture Mania.--A Living Comes at Last.--The\r\nwit's Ministry.--The Parsonage House at Foston-le-Clay.--Country Quiet.\r\nThe Universal Scratcher.--Country Life and Country Prejudice.--The Genial\r\nMagistrate.--Glimpse of Edinburgh Society.--Mrs. Grant of Laggan.

A wit he was, but we must deny him the\r\nreputation of being a beau. For that, nature, no less than his holy\r\noffice, had disqualified him. Who that ever beheld him in a London\r\ndrawing-room, when he went to so many dinners that he used to say he was\r\na walking patty--who could ever miscall him a beau? How few years have\r\nwe numbered since one perceived the large bulky form in canonical\r\nattire--the plain, heavy face, large, long, unredeemed by any\r\nexpression, except that of sound hard sense--and thought, 'can this be\r\nthe Wit?' How few years is it since Henry Cockburn, hating London, and\r\ncoming but rarely to what he called the 'devil's drawing room,' stood\r\nnear him, yet apart, for he was the most diffident of men; his wonderful\r\nluminous eyes, his clear, almost youthful, vivid complexion, contrasting\r\nbrightly with the gray, pallid, prebendal complexion of Sydney? how\r\nshort a time since Francis Jeffery, the smallest of great men, a beau in\r\nhis old age, a wit to the last, stood hat in hand to bandy words with\r\nSydney ere he rushed off to some still gayer scene, some more\r\nfashionable circle: yet they are all gone--gone from sight, living in\r\nmemory alone.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was time: they might have lived, indeed, a few short years\r\nlonger; we might have heard their names amongst us; listened to their\r\nvoices; gazed upon the deep hazel, ever-sparkling eyes, that constituted\r\nthe charm of Cockburn's handsome face, and made all other faces seem\r\ntame and dead: we might have marvelled at the ingenuity, the happy turns\r\nof expression, the polite sarcasm of Jeffrey; we might have revelled in\r\nSydney Smith's immense natural gift of fun, and listened to the 'wise\r\nwit,' regretting with Lord Cockburn, that so much worldly wisdom seemed\r\nalmost inappropriate in one who should have been in some freer sphere\r\nthan within the pale of holy orders: we might have done this, but the\r\npicture might have been otherwise. Cockburn, whose intellect rose, and\r\nbecame almost sublime, as his spirit neared death, might have sunk into\r\nthe depression of conscious weakness; Jeffery might have repeated\r\nhimself, or turned hypochondriacal; Sydney Smith have grown garrulous:\r\nlet us not grieve; they went in their prime of intellect, before one\r\nquality of mind had been touched by the frostbite of age.\r\n\r\nSydney Smith's life is a chronicle of literary society. He was born in\r\n1771, and he died in 1845. What a succession of great men does that\r\nperiod comprise! Scott, Jeffrey, Mackintosh, Dugald Stewart, Homer,\r\nBrougham and Cockburn were his familiars--a constellation which has set,\r\nwe fear, for ever. Our world presents nothing like it: we must look\r\nback, not around us, for strong minds, cultivated up to the nicest\r\npoint. Our age is too diffused, too practical for us to hope to witness\r\nagain so grand a spectacle.\r\n\r\nFrom his progenitors Sydney Smith inherited one of his best gifts, great\r\nanimal spirits--the only spirits one wants in this racking life of ours;\r\nand his were transmitted to him by his father. That father, Mr. Robert\r\nSmith, was odd as well as clever. His oddities seem to have been coupled\r\nwith folly but that of Sydney was soberized by thought, and swayed by\r\nintense common sense. The father had a mania for buying and altering\r\nplaces: one need hardly say that he spoiled them. Having done so, he\r\ngenerally sold them; and _nineteen_ various places were thus the source\r\nof expense to him, and of injury to the pecuniary interests of his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThis strange spendthrift married a Miss Olier, a daughter of a French\r\nemigrant, from Languedoc. Every one may remember the charming attributes\r\ngiven by Miss Kavanagh, in her delicious tale, 'Nathalie,' to the French\r\nwomen of the South. This Miss Olier seems to have realized all one's\r\nideas of the handsome, sweet-tempered, high-minded Southrons of _la\r\nbelle France_. To her Sydney Smith traced his native gaiety; her beauty\r\ndid not, certainly, pass to him as well as to some of her other\r\ndescendants. When Talleyrand was living in England as an emigrant, on\r\nintimate terms with Robert Smith, Sydney's brother, or Bobus, as he was\r\ncalled by his intimates, the conversation turned one day on hereditary\r\nbeauty. Bobus spoke of his mother's personal perfections: _'Ah, mon\r\nami,'_ cried Talleyrand, _c'était apparemment, monsieur: volre père qui\r\nn'était pas bien.'_\r\n\r\nThis Bobus was the schoolfellow at Eton of Canning and Frere; and with\r\nJohn Smith and those two youths, wrote the 'Microcosm.' Sydney, on the\r\nother hand, was placed on the Foundation, at Winchester, which was then\r\na stern place of instruction for a gay, spirited, hungry boy. Courtenay,\r\nhis younger brother, went with him, but ran away twice. To owe one's\r\neducation to charity was, in those days, to be half starved. Never was\r\nthere enough, even of the coarsest food, to satisfy the boys, and the\r\nurchins, fresh from home, were left to fare as they might. 'Neglect,\r\nabuse, and vice were,' Sydney used to say, 'the pervading evils of\r\nWinchester; and the system of teaching, if one may so call it, savoured\r\nof the old monastic narrowness.... I believe, when a boy at school, I\r\nmade above ten thousand Latin verses, and no man in his senses would\r\ndream of ever making another in after-life. So much for life and time\r\nwasted.' The verse-inciting process is, nevertheless, remorselessly\r\ncarried on during three years more at Oxford and is much oftener the\r\ntest of patient stupidity than of aspiring talent, Yet of what\r\nstupendous importance it is in the attainment of scholarships and\r\nprizes; and how zealous, how tenacious, are dons and 'coaches' in\r\nholding to that which far higher classics, the Germans, regard with\r\ncontempt!\r\n\r\nSydney's proficiency promoted him to be captain of the school, and he\r\nleft Winchester for New College, Oxford---one of the noblest and most\r\nabused institutions then of that grand university. Having obtained a\r\nscholarship, as a matter of course, and afterwards a fellowship, he\r\nremarked that the usual bumpers of port wine at college were as much the\r\norder of the day among the Fellows as Latin verses among the\r\nundergraduates. We may not, however, picture to ourselves Sydney as\r\npartaking of the festivities of the common room; with more probability\r\nlet us imagine him wandering with steady gait, even _after_ Hall--a\r\nthing not even then or now certain in colleges--in those evergreen,\r\nleafy, varied gardens, flanked by that old St. Peter's church on the one\r\nside, and guarded by the high wall, once a fortification, on the other.\r\nHe was poor, and therefore safe, for poverty is a guardian angel to an\r\nundergraduate, and work may protect even the Fellow from utter\r\ndeterioration.\r\n\r\nHe was turned out into the world by his father with his hundred a year\r\nfrom the Fellowship, and never had a farthing from the old destroyer of\r\ncountry-seats afterwards. He never owed a sixpence; nay, he paid a debt\r\nof thirty pounds, which Courtenay, who had no _iron_ in his character,\r\nhad incurred at Winchester, and had not the courage to avow. The next\r\nstep was to choose a profession. The bar would have been Sydney's\r\nchoice; but the church was the choice of his father. It is the cheapest\r\nchannel by which a man may pass into genteel poverty; 'wit and\r\nindependence do not make bishops,' as Lord Cockburn remarks. We do not,\r\nhowever, regard, as he does, Sydney Smith as 'lost' by being a\r\nchurchman. He was happy, and made others happy; he was good, and made\r\nothers good. Who can say the same of a successful barrister, or of a\r\npopular orator? His first sphere was in a curacy on Salisbury Plain; one\r\nof his earliest clerical duties was to marry his brother Robert (a\r\nbarrister) to Miss Vernon, aunt to Lord Lansdowne. 'All I can tell you\r\nof the marriage,' Sydney wrote to his mother, 'is that he cried, she\r\ncried, I cried.' It was celebrated in the library at Bowood, where\r\nSydney so often enchanted the captivating circle afterwards by his wit.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more gloomy than the young pastor's life on Salisbury\r\nPlain: 'the first and poorest pauper of the hamlet,' as he calls a\r\ncurate, he was seated down among a few scattered cottages on this vast\r\nflat; visited even by the butcher's cart only once a week from\r\nSalisbury; accosted by few human beings; shunned by all who loved social\r\nlife. But the probation was not long; and after being nearly destroyed\r\nby a thunder-storm in one of his rambles, he quitted Salisbury Plain,\r\nafter two years, for a more genial scene.\r\n\r\nThere was an hospitable squire, a Mr. Beach, living in Smith's parish;\r\nthe village of Netherhaven, near Amesbury. Mr. Beach had a son; the\r\nquiet Sundays at the Hall were enlivened by the curate's company at\r\ndinner, and Mr. Beach found his guest both amusing and sensible, and\r\nbegged him to become tutor to the young squire. Smith accepted; and went\r\naway with his pupil, intending to visit Germany. The French Revolution\r\nwas, however, at its height. Germany was impracticable, and 'we were\r\ndriven,' Sydney wrote to his mother, 'by stress of politics, into\r\nEdinburgh.'\r\n\r\nThis accident,--this seeming accident,--was the foundation of Sydney\r\nSmith's opportunities; not of his success, for that his own merits\r\nprocured, but of the direction to which his efforts were applied. He\r\nwould have been eminent, wherever destiny had led him; but he was thus\r\nmade to be useful in one especial manner; 'his lines had, indeed, fallen\r\nin pleasant places.'\r\n\r\nEdinburgh, in 1797, was not, it is almost needless to say, the Edinburgh\r\nof 1860. An ancient, picturesque, high-built looking city, with its\r\nwynds and closes, it had far more the characteristics of an old French\r\n_ville de province_ than of a northern capital. The foundation-stone of\r\nthe new College was laid in 1789, but the building was not finished\r\nuntil more than forty years afterwards. The edifice then stood in the\r\nmidst of fields and gardens. 'Often.' writes Lord Cockburn, 'did we\r\nstand to admire the blue and yellow crocuses rising through the clean\r\nearth in the first days of spring, in the house of Doctor Monro (the\r\nsecond), whose house stood in a small field entering from Nicolson\r\nStreet, within less than a hundred yards from the college.'\r\n\r\nThe New Town was in progress when Sydney Smith and his pupil took refuge\r\nin 'Auld Reekie.' With the rise of every street some fresh innovation in\r\nmanners seemed also to begin. Lord Cockburn, wedded as he was to his\r\nbeloved Reekie, yet unprejudiced and candid on all points, ascribes the\r\nchange in customs to the intercourse with the English, and seems to date\r\nit from the Union. Thus the overflowing of the old town into fresh\r\nspaces, 'implied,' as he remarks, 'a general alteration of our habits.'\r\n\r\nAs the dwellers in the Faubourg St. Germain regard their neighbours\r\nacross the Seine, in the Faubourg St. Honoré, with disapproving eyes, so\r\nthe sojourners in the Canongate and the Cowgate considered that the\r\ninundation of modern population vulgarized their 'prescriptive\r\ngentilities.' Cockburn's description of a Scottish assembly in the olden\r\ntime is most interesting.\r\n\r\n'For example, Saint Cecilia's Hall was the only public resort of the\r\nmusical; and besides being our most selectly fashionable place of\r\namusement, was the best and most beautiful concert-room I have ever\r\nseen. And there have I myself seen most of our literary and fashionable\r\ngentlemen, predominating with their side curls and frills, and ruffles,\r\nand silver buckles; and our stately matrons stiffened in hoops, and\r\ngorgeous satin; and our beauties with high-heeled shoes, powdered and\r\npomatumed hair, and lofty and composite head-dresses. All this was in\r\nthe Cowgate; the last retreat now-a-days of destitution and disease. The\r\nbuilding still stands, through raised and changed. When I last saw it,\r\nit seemed to be partly an old-clothesman's shop and partly a brazier's.'\r\nBalls were held in the beautiful rooms of George Square, in spite of the\r\n'New Town piece of presumption,' that is, an attempt to force the\r\nfashionable dancers of the reel into the George Street apartments.\r\n\r\n'And here,' writes Lord Cockburn, looking back to the days when he was\r\nthat 'ne'er-do-weel' Harry Cockburn, 'were the last remains of the\r\nball-room discipline of the preceding age. Martinet dowagers and\r\nvenerable beaux acted as masters and mistresses of ceremonies, and made\r\nall the preliminary arrangements. No couple could dance unless each\r\nparty was provided with a ticket prescribing the precise place, in the\r\nprecise dance. If there was no ticket, the gentleman or the lady was\r\ndealt with as an intruder, and turned out of the dance. If the ticket\r\nhad marked upon it---say for a country-dance, the figures, 3, 5; this\r\nmeant that the holder was to place himself in the 3rd dance, and 5th\r\nfrom the top; and if he was anywhere else, he was set right or excluded.\r\nAnd the partner's ticket must correspond. Woe on the poor girl who with\r\nticket 2, 7, was found opposite a youth marked 5, 9! It was flirting\r\nwithout a licence, and looked very ill, and would probably be reported\r\nby the ticket director of that dance to the mother.'\r\n\r\nAll this had passed away; and thus the aristocracy of a few individuals\r\nwas ended; and society, freed from some of its restraints, flourished in\r\nanother and more enlightened way than formerly.\r\n\r\nThere were still a sufficient number of peculiarities to gratify one who\r\nhad an eye to the ludicrous. Sydney Smith soon discovered that it is a\r\nwork of time to impart a humorous idea to a true Scot. 'It requires,' he\r\nused to say, 'a surgical operation to get a joke well into a Scotch\r\nunderstanding.' 'They are so embued with metaphysics, that they even\r\nmake love metaphysically. I overheard a young lady of my acquaintance,\r\nat a dance in Edinburgh, exclaim in a sudden pause of the music, \"What\r\nyou say, my Lord, is very true of love in the _abstract_, but,--\" here\r\nthe fiddlers began fiddling furiously, and the rest was lost.' He was,\r\nhowever, most deeply touched by the noble attribute of that nation which\r\nretains what is so rare--the attribute of being true friends. He did\r\nample justice to their kindliness of heart. 'If you meet with an\r\naccident,' he said, 'half Edinburgh immediately flocks to your doors to\r\ninquire after your _pure_ hand, or your _pure_ foot.' 'Their temper,' he\r\nobserved, 'stands anything but an attack on their climate; even Jeffrey\r\ncannot shake off the illusion that myrtles flourish at Craig Crook.' The\r\nsharp reviewer stuck to his myrtle allusions, and treated Smith's\r\nattempts with as much contempt as if he had been a 'wild visionary, who\r\nhad never breathed his caller air,' nor suffered under the rigours of\r\nhis climate, nor spent five years in 'discussing metaphysics and\r\nmedicine in that garret end of the earth,--that knuckle end of\r\nEngland--that land of Calvin, oat-cakes, and sulphur,' as Smith termed\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nDuring two years he braved the winters, in which he declared\r\nhackney-coaches were drawn by four horses on account of the snow; where\r\nmen were blown flat down on the face by the winds; and where even\r\n'experienced Scotch fowls did not dare to cross the streets, but sidled\r\nalong, tails aloft, without venturing to encounter the gale.' He\r\nluxuriated, nevertheless, in the true Scotch supper, than which nothing\r\nmore pleasant and more unwholesome has ever been known in Christendom.\r\nEdinburgh is said to have been the only place where people dined twice a\r\nday. The writer of this memoir is old enough to remember the true\r\nScottish _Attic_ supper before its final 'fading into wine and water,'\r\nas Lord Cockburn describes its decline. 'Suppers,' Cockburn truly says,\r\n'are cheaper than dinners,' and Edinburgh, at that time, was the\r\ncheapest place in Great Britain. Port and sherry were the staple wines:\r\nclaret, duty free in Scotland until 1780, was indeed beginning to be a\r\nluxury; it was no longer the ordinary beverage, as it was when as\r\nMackenzie, the author of the 'Man of Feeling,' described--it used, upon\r\nthe arrival of a cargo, to be sent through the town on a cart with a\r\nhorse before it, so that every one might have a sample, by carrying a\r\njug to be filled for sixpence: still even at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury it was in frequent use. Whisky toddy and plotty (red wine mulled\r\nwith spices) came into the supper-room in ancient flagons or _stoups_\r\nafter a lengthy repast of broiled chickens, roasted moorfowl, pickled\r\nmussels, flummery, and numerous other good things had been discussed by\r\na party who ate as if they had not dined that day. 'We will eat,' Lord\r\nCockburn used to say after a long walk, 'a profligate supper,'--a supper\r\nwithout regard to discretion, or digestion; and he usually kept his\r\nword.\r\n\r\nIn Edinburgh, Sydney Smith formed the intimate acquaintance of Lord\r\nJeffrey, and that acquaintance ripened into a friendship only closed by\r\ndeath. The friendship of worthy, sensible men he looked upon as one of\r\nthe greatest pleasures in life.\r\n\r\nThe 'old suns,' Lord Cockburn tells us, 'were setting when the band of\r\ngreat thinkers and great writers who afterwards concocted the \"Edinburgh\r\nReview,\" were rising into celebrity.' Principal Robertson, the\r\nhistorian, had departed this life in 1793, a kindly old man. With\r\nbeaming eyes underneath his frizzed and curled wig, and a trumpet tied\r\nwith a black ribbon to the button-hole of his coat, for he was deaf,\r\nthis most excellent of writers showed how he could be also the most\r\nzealous of diners. Old Adam Ferguson, the historian of Rome, had 'set,'\r\nalso: one of the finest specimens of humanity had gone from among his\r\npeople in him. Old people, not thirty years ago, delighted to tell you\r\nhow 'Adam,' when chaplain to the Black Watch, that glorious 42nd,\r\nrefused to retire to his proper place, the rear, during an action, but\r\npersisted in being engaged in front. He was also gone; and Dugald\r\nStewart filled his vacant place in the professorship of moral\r\nphilosophy. Dr. Henry, the historian, was also at rest; after a long\r\nlaborious life, and the compilation of a dull, though admirable History\r\nof England, the design of which, in making a chapter on arts, manners,\r\nand literature separate from the narrative, appears to have suggested to\r\nMacaulay his inimitable disquisition on the same topics. Dr. Henry\r\nshowed to a friend a pile of books which he had gone through, merely to\r\nsatisfy himself and the world as to what description of trousers was\r\nworn by the Saxons. His death was calm as his life. 'Come out to me\r\ndirectly,' he wrote to his friend, Sir Harry Moncrieff: 'I have got\r\nsomething to do this week; I have got to die.'\r\n\r\nIt was in 1801, that Dugald Stewart began his course of lectures on\r\npolitical economy. Hitherto all public favour had been on the side of\r\nthe Tories, and independence of thought was a sure way to incur\r\ndiscouragement from the Bench, in the Church, and from every Government\r\nfunctionary. Lectures on political economy were regarded as innovations;\r\nbut they formed a forerunner of that event which had made several\r\nimportant changes in our literary and political hemisphere: the\r\ncommencement of the 'Edinburgh Review.' This undertaking was the work of\r\nmen who were separated from the mass of their brother-townsmen by their\r\npolitics; their isolation as a class binding them the more closely\r\ntogether by links never broken, in a brotherhood of hope and ambition,\r\nto which the natural spirits of Sydney Smith, of Cockburn, and of\r\nJeffrey, gave an irresistible charm.\r\n\r\nAmong those who the most early in life ended a career of promise was\r\nFrancis Horner. He was the son of a linen-draper in Edinburgh; or, as\r\nthe Scotch call it, following the French, a merchant. Homer's best linen\r\nfor sheets, and table-cloths, and all the _under garments_ of\r\nhousekeeping, are still highly esteemed by the trade.\r\n\r\n'My desire to know Horner,' Sydney Smith states, 'arose from my being\r\ncautioned against him by some excellent and feeble-minded people to whom\r\nI brought letters of introduction, and who represented him as a person\r\nof violent political opinions.' Sydney Smith interpreted this to mean\r\nthat Horner was a man who thought for himself; who loved truth better\r\nthan he loved Dundas (Lord Melville), then the tyrant of Scotland. 'It\r\nis very curious to consider,' Sydney Smith wrote, in addressing Lady\r\nHolland, in 1817, 'in what manner Horner gained, in so extraordinary a\r\ndegree, the affections of such a number of persons of both sexes, all\r\nages, parties, and ranks in society; for he was not remarkably good\r\ntempered, nor particularly lively and agreeable; and an inflexible\r\npolitician on the unpopular side. The causes are, his high character for\r\nprobity, honour, and talents; his fine countenance; the benevolent\r\ninterest he took in the concerns of all his friends; his simple and\r\ngentlemanlike manners; his untimely death.' 'Grave, studious,\r\nhonourable, kind, everything Horner did,' says Lord Cockburn, 'was\r\nmarked by thoughtfulness and kindness;' a beautiful character, which was\r\nexhibited but briefly to his contemporaries, but long remembered after\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nHenry Brougham was another of the Edinburgh band of young spirits. He\r\nwas educated in the High School under Luke Fraser, the tutor who trained\r\nWalter Scott and Francis Jeffrey. Brougham used to be pointed out 'as\r\nthe fellow who had beat the master.' He had dared to differ with Fraser,\r\na hot pedant, on some piece of Latinity. Fraser, irritated, punished the\r\nrebel, and thought the matter ended. But the next day 'Harry,' as they\r\ncalled him, appeared, loaded with books, renewed the charge, and forced\r\nLuke to own that he was beaten. 'It was then,' says Lord Cockburn, 'that\r\nI first saw him.'\r\n\r\nAfter remaining two years in Edinburgh, Sydney Smith went southwards to\r\nmarry a former schoolfellow of his sister Maria's--a Miss Pybus, to whom\r\nhe had been attached and engaged at a very early period of his life. The\r\nyoung lady, who was of West Indian descent, had some fortune; but her\r\nhusband's only stock, on which to begin housekeeping, consisted of six\r\nsilver tea-spoons, worn away with use. One day he rushed into the room\r\nand threw these attenuated articles into her lap--'There, Kate, I give\r\nyou all my fortune, you lucky girl!'\r\n\r\nWith the small _dôt_, and the thin silver-spoons, the young couple set\r\nup housekeeping in the 'garret end of the earth.' Their first difficulty\r\nwas to know how money could be obtained to begin with, for Mrs. Smith's\r\nsmall fortune was settled on herself by her husband's wish. Two rows of\r\npearls had been given her by her thoughtful mother. These she converted\r\ninto money, and obtained for them £500. Several years afterwards, when\r\nvisiting the shop at which she sold them, with Miss Vernon and Miss Fox,\r\nMrs. Smith saw her pearls, every one of which she knew. She asked what\r\nwas the price. '£1,500,' was the reply.\r\n\r\nThe sum, however, was all important to the thrifty couple. It distanced\r\nthe nightmare of the poor and honest,--debt. £750 was presented by Mr.\r\nBeach, in gratitude for the care of his son, to Smith. It was invested\r\nin the funds, and formed the nucleus of future savings,--'_Ce n'est que\r\nle premier pas qui coûte_' is a trite saying. '_C'est le premier pas qui\r\ngagne_, might be applied to this and similar cases. A little\r\ndaughter--Lady Holland, the wife of the celebrated physician, Sir Henry\r\nHolland--was sent to bless the sensible pair. Sydney had wished that she\r\nmight be born with one eye, so that he might never lose her;\r\nnevertheless, though she happened to be born with two, he bore her\r\nsecretly from the nursery, a few hours after her birth, to show her in\r\ntriumph to the future Edinburgh Reviewers.\r\n\r\nThe birth of the 'Edinburgh Review' quickly followed that of the young\r\nlady. Jeffrey,--then an almost starving barrister, living in the eighth\r\nor ninth flat of a house in Buccleuch Place,--Brougham, and Sydney Smith\r\nwere the triumvirate who propounded the scheme, Smith being the first\r\nmover. He proposed a motto: 'Tenui Musam meditanum avenir:' We cultivate\r\nliterature on a little oatmeal; but this being too near the truth, they\r\ntook their motto from Publius Syrus; 'of whom,' said Smith, 'none of us\r\nhad, I am sure, read a single line.' To this undertaking Sydney Smith\r\ndevoted his talents for more than twenty-eight years.\r\n\r\nMeantime, during the brief remainder of his stay in Edinburgh, his\r\ncircumstances improved. He had done that which most of the clergy are\r\nobliged to do--taken a pupil. He had now another, the son of Mr. Gordon,\r\nof Ellon; for each of these young men he received £400 a year. He became\r\nto them a father and a friend; he entered into all their amusements. One\r\nof them saying that he could not find conversation at the balls for his\r\npartners, 'Never mind,' cried Sydney Smith, 'I'll fit you up in five\r\nminutes.' Accordingly he wrote down conversations for them amid bursts\r\nof laughter.\r\n\r\nThus happily did years, which many persons would have termed a season of\r\nadversity, pass away. The chance which brought him to Edinburgh\r\nintroduced him to a state of society never likely to be seen again in\r\nScotland. Lord Cockburn's 'Memorials' afford an insight into manners,\r\nnot only as regarded suppers, but on the still momentous point, of\r\ndinners. Three o'clock was the fashionable hour, so late as the\r\ncommencement of the present century. That hour, 'not without groans and\r\npredictions,' became four--and four was long and conscientiously adhered\r\nto. 'Inch by inch,' people yielded, and five continued to be the\r\nstandard polite hour from 1806 to 1820. 'Six has at length prevailed.'\r\n\r\nThe most punctilious ceremony existed. When dinner was announced, a file\r\nof ladies went first in strict order of precedence. 'Mrs. Colonel Such\r\nan One;' 'Mrs. Doctor Such an One,' and so on. Toasts were _de rigueur_:\r\nno glass of wine was to be taken by a guest without comprehending a\r\nlady, or a covey of ladies. 'I was present,' says Lord Cockburn, 'when\r\nthe late Duke of Buccleuch took a glass of sherry by himself at the\r\ntable of Charles Hope, then Lord Advocate, and this was noticed as a\r\npiece of ducal contempt.' Toasts, and when the ladies had retired,\r\n_rounds_ of toasts, were drunk. 'The prandial nuisance,' Lord Cockburn\r\nwrote, 'was horrible. But it was nothing to what followed.'\r\n\r\nAt these repasts, though less at these than at boisterous suppers, a\r\nfrequent visitor at the same table with Sydney Smith was the illustrious\r\nSir James Mackintosh, a man to whose deep-thinking mind the world is\r\nevery day rendering justice. The son of a brave officer, Mackintosh was\r\nborn on the banks of Loch Ness: his mother, a Miss Fraser, was aunt to\r\nMrs. Fraser Tytler, wife of Lord Woodhouselee, one of the judges of the\r\nCourt of Session and mother of the late historian of that honoured name.\r\n\r\nMackintosh had been studying at Aberdeen, in the same classes with\r\nRobert Hall, whose conversation, he avowed, had a great influence over\r\nhis mind. He arrived in Edinburgh about 1784, uncertain to what\r\nprofession to belong; somewhat anxious to be a bookseller, in order to\r\nrevel in 'the paradise of books;' he turned his attention, however, to\r\nmedicine, and became a Brunonian, that is, a disciple of John Brown, the\r\nfounder of a theory which he followed out to the extent in practice. The\r\nmain feature of the now defunct system, which set scientific Europe in a\r\nblaze, seems to have been a mad indulgence of the passions; and an\r\nunbridled use of intoxicating liquors. Brown fell a victim to his vices.\r\nYears after he had been laid in his grave, his daughter, Euphemia, being\r\nin great indigence, received real kindness from Sir James and Lady\r\nMackintosh, the former of whom used to delight in telling the story of\r\nher father's saying to her: 'Effy, bring me the mooderate stimulus of a\r\nhoonderd draps o' laudanum in a glass o' brandy.'\r\n\r\nMackintosh had not quitted Edinburgh when Sydney Smith reached it. Smith\r\nbecame a member of the famous Speculative Society. Their acquaintance\r\nwas renewed years afterwards in London. Who can ever forget the small,\r\nquiet dinners given by Mackintosh when living out of Parliament, and out\r\nof office in Cadogan Place? Simple but genial were those repasts,\r\nforming a strong contrast to the Edinburgh dinners of yore. He had then\r\nlong given up both the theory and practice of the Brunonians, and took\r\nnothing but light French and German wines, and these in moderation. His\r\ntall, somewhat high-shouldered, massive form; his calm brow, mild,\r\nthoughtful; his dignity of manner; his gentleness to all; his vast\r\nknowledge; his wonderful appreciation of excellence; his discrimination\r\nof faults--all combined to form one of the finest specimens ever seen,\r\neven in that illustrious period, of a philosopher and historian.\r\n\r\nJeffrey and Cockburn were contrasts to one whom they honoured. Jeffrey,\r\n'the greatest of British critics,' was eight years younger than\r\nMackintosh, having been born in 1773. He was the son of one of the\r\ndepute clerks to the Supreme Court, not an elevated position, though one\r\nof great respectability. When Mackintosh and Sydney Smith first knew him\r\nin Edinburgh, he was enduring, with all the impatience of his sensitive\r\nnature, what he called 'a slow, obscure, philosophical starvation' at\r\nthe Scotch bar.\r\n\r\n'There are moments,' he wrote, 'when I think I could sell myself to the\r\nministers or to the devil, in order to get above these necessities.'\r\nLike all men so situated, his depression came in fits. Short, spare,\r\nwith regular, yet _not_ aristocratic features;--speaking, brilliant, yet\r\n_not_ pleasing eyes;--a voice consistent with that _mignon_ form;--a\r\nsomewhat precise and anxious manner, there was never in Jeffrey that\r\ncharm, that _abandon_, which rendered his valued friend, Henry Cockburn,\r\nthe most delightful, the most beloved of men, the very idol of his\r\nnative city.\r\n\r\nThe noble head of Cockburn, bald, almost in youth, with its pliant,\r\nrefined features, and its fresh tint upon a cheek always clear,\r\ngenerally high in colour, was a strong contrast to the rigid _petitesse_\r\nof Jeffrey's physiognomy; much more so to the large proportions of\r\nMackintosh; or to the ponderous, plain, and, later in life, swarthy\r\ncountenance of Sydney Smith. Lord Webb Seymour, the brother of the late\r\nDuke of Somerset, gentle, modest, intelligent,--Thomas Thomson, the\r\nantiquary,--and Charles and George Bell, the surgeon and the advocate,--\r\nMurray, afterwards Lord Murray, the generous pleader, who gave up to its\r\nrightful heirs an estate left him by a client,--and Brougham--formed the\r\nstaple of that set now long since extinct.\r\n\r\nIt was partially broken up by Sydney Smith's coming, in 1803, to London.\r\nHe there took a house in Doughty Street, being partial to legal society,\r\nwhich was chiefly to be found in that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nHere Sir Samuel Romilly, Mackintosh, Scarlett (Lord Abinger), the\r\neccentric and unhappy Mr. Ward, afterwards Lord Dudley, 'Conversation'\r\nSharp, Rogers, and Luttrell, formed the circle in which Sidney\r\ndelighted. He was still very poor, and obliged to sell the rest of his\r\nwife's jewels; but his brother Robert allowed him £100 a year, and lent\r\nhim, when he subsequently removed into Yorkshire, £500.\r\n\r\nHe had now a life of struggling, but those struggles were the lot of his\r\nearly friends also; Mackintosh talked of going to India as a lecturer;\r\nSmith recommended Jeffrey to do the same. Happily, both had the courage\r\nand the sense to await for better times at home; yet Smith's opinion of\r\nMackintosh was, that 'he never saw so theoretical a head which contained\r\nso much practical understanding;' and to Jeffrey he wrote:\r\n\r\n'You want nothing to be a great lawyer, and nothing to be a great\r\nspeaker, but a deeper voice--slower and more simple utterance--more\r\nhumility of face and neck--and a greater contempt for _esprit_ than men\r\n_who have so much_ in general attain to.'\r\n\r\nThe great event of Sydney Smith's first residence in London was his\r\nintroduction at Holland House; in that 'gilded room which furnished,' as\r\nhe said, 'the best and most agreeable society in the world,' his\r\nhappiest hours were passed. John Allen, whom Smith had introduced to\r\nLord Holland was the peer's librarian and friend. Mackintosh, who Sydney\r\nSmith thought only wanted a few bad qualities to get on in the world,\r\nRogers, Luttrell, Sheridan, Byron, were among the 'suns' that shone,\r\nwhere Addison had suffered and studied.\r\n\r\nBetween Lord Holland and Sydney Smith the most cordial friendship\r\nexisted; and the eccentric and fascinating Lady Holland was his constant\r\ncorrespondent. Of this able woman, it was said by Talleyrand: '_Elle est\r\ntoute assertion; mais quand on demande la preuve c'est là son sécret_'\r\nOf Lord Holland, the keen diplomatist observed: '_Cest la bienveillance\r\nmême, mais la bienveillance la plus perturbatrice, qu'on ait jamais\r\nvue._'\r\n\r\nLord Holland did not commit the error ascribed by Rogers, in his\r\nRecollections, to Marlay, Bishop of Waterford, who when poor, with an\r\nincome of only £400 a year, used to give the best dinners possible; but,\r\nwhen made a bishop, enlarged his table, and lost his fame-had no more\r\ngood company--there was an end of his enjoyment: he had lords and ladies\r\nto his table--foolish people--foolish men--and foolish women--and there\r\nwas an end of him and us. 'Lord Holland selected his lords and ladies,\r\nnot for their rank, but for their peculiar merits or acquirements.' Then\r\neven Lady Holland's oddities were amusing. When she wanted to get rid of\r\na fop, she used to say: 'I beg your pardon, but I wish you would sit a\r\nlittle farther off; there is something on your handkerchief which I\r\ndon't quite like.' Or when a poor man happened to stand, after the\r\nfashion of the lords of creation, with his back close to the\r\nchimney-piece, she would cry out, 'Have the goodness, sir, to stir the\r\nfire.'\r\n\r\nLord Holland never asked any one to dinner, ('not even _me_,' says\r\nRogers, 'whom he had known so long,') without asking Lady Holland. One\r\nday, shortly before his lordship's death, Rogers was coming out from\r\nHolland House when he met him. 'Well, do you return to dinner?' I\r\nanswered. 'No, I have not been invited.' The precaution, in fact, was\r\nnecessary, for Lord Holland was so good-natured and hospitable that he\r\nwould have had a crowd daily at his table had he been left to himself.\r\n\r\nThe death of Lord Holland completely broke up the unrivalled dinners,\r\nand the subsequent evenings in the 'gilded chamber.' Lady Holland, to\r\nwhom Holland House was left for her life-time, declined to live there.\r\nWith Holland House, the mingling of aristocracy with talent; the\r\nblending ranks by force of intellect; the assembling not only of all the\r\ncelebrity that Europe could boast, but of all that could enhance private\r\nenjoyment, had ceased. London, the most intelligent of capitals,\r\npossesses not one single great house in which pomp and wealth are made\r\nsubsidiary to the true luxury of intellectual conversation.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the day when Lord Holland's last illness began, these\r\nlines were written by him, and found after his death on his\r\ndressing-table:--\r\n\r\n  'Nephew of Fox, and Friend of Grey,\r\n    Sufficient for my fame,\r\n  If those who know me best shall say\r\n    I tarnished neither name.'\r\n\r\nOf him his best friend, Sydney Smith, left a short but discriminative\r\ncharacter. 'There was never (amongst other things he says) a better\r\nheart, or one more purified from all the bad passions--more abounding in\r\ncharity and compassion--or which seemed to be so created as a refuge to\r\nthe helpless and oppressed.'\r\n\r\nMeantime Sydney Smith's circumstances were still limited; £50 a year as\r\nevening preacher to the Foundling Hospital was esteemed as a great help\r\nby him. The writer of this memoir remembers an amusing anecdote related\r\nof him at the table of an eminent literary character by a member of Lord\r\nWoodhouselee's family, who had been desirous to obtain for Sydney the\r\npatronage of the godly. To this end she persuaded Robert Grant and\r\nCharles Grant (afterwards Lord Glenelg) to go to the Foundling to hear\r\nhim, she hoped to advantage; to her consternation he broke forth into so\r\nfamiliar a strain, couched in terms so bordering on the jocose,--though\r\nno one had deeper religious convictions than he had,--that the two\r\nsaintly brothers listened in disgust. They forgot how South let loose\r\nthe powers of his wit and sarcasm; and how the lofty-minded Jeremy\r\nTaylor applied the force of humour to lighten the prolixity of argument.\r\nSydney Smith became, nevertheless, a most popular preacher; but the man\r\nwho prevents people from sleeping once a week in their pews is sure to\r\nbe criticised.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to him, however, as a member of society. His circle of\r\nacquaintance was enlarged, not only by his visits to Holland House, but\r\nby his lectures on moral philosophy at the Royal Institution. Sir Robert\r\nPeel, not the most impressionable of men, but one whose cold shake of\r\nthe hand is said--as Sydney Smith said of Sir James Mackintosh--'to have\r\ncome under the genus _Mortmain_' was a very young man at the time when\r\nAlbemarle Street was crowded with carriages from one end of the street\r\nto the other, in consequence of Sydney Smith's lectures; yet he declared\r\nthat he had never forgotten the effect given to the speech of Logan, the\r\nIndian chief, by Sydney's voice and manner.\r\n\r\nHis lectures produced a sum sufficient for Sydney to furnish a house in\r\nOrchard Street. Doughty Street--raised to celebrity as having been the\r\nresidence, not only of Sydney Smith, but of Charles Dickens--was too far\r\nfor the _habitué_ of Holland House and the orator of Albemarle Street\r\nlong to sojourn there. In Orchard Street, Sydney enjoyed that domestic\r\ncomfort which he called 'the grammar of life;' delightful suppers, to\r\nabout twenty or thirty persons, who came and went as they pleased. A\r\ngreat part of the same amusing and gifted set used to meet once a week\r\nalso at Sir James Mackintosh's, at a supper, which, though not exactly\r\nCowper's 'radish and an egg,' was simple, but plentiful--yet most\r\neagerly sought after. 'There are a few living,' writes Sydney Smith's\r\ndaughter, 'who can look back to them, and I have always found them do so\r\nwith a sigh of regret.'\r\n\r\nOne night, a country cousin of Sydney Smith's was present at a supper.\r\n'Now, Sydney,' whispered the simple girl, 'I know all these are very\r\nremarkable people; do tell me who they are.'--'Oh, yes; there's\r\nHannibal,' pointing to a grave, dry, stern man, Mr. Whishaw; 'he lost\r\nhis leg in the Carthagenian war: there's Socrates,' pointing to\r\nLuttrell: 'that,' he added, turning to Horner, 'is Solon.'\r\n\r\nAnother evening, Mackintosh brought a raw Scotch cousin--an ensign in a\r\nHighland regiment--with him. The young man's head could carry no idea of\r\nglory except in regimentals. Suddenly, nudging Sir James, he whispered,\r\n'Is that the great Sir Sydney Smith?'--'Yes, yes,' answered Sir James;\r\nand instantly telling Sydney who he was supposed to be, the grave\r\nevening preacher at the Foundling immediately assumed the character\r\nascribed to him, and acted the hero of Acre to perfection, fighting his\r\nbattles over again--even charging the Turks--whilst the young Scot was\r\nso enchanted by the great Sir Sydney's condescension, that he wanted to\r\nfetch the pipers of his regiment, and pipe to the great Sir Sydney, who\r\nhad never enjoyed the agonizing strains of the bagpipe. Upon this the\r\nparty broke up, and Sir James carried the Highlander off, lest he should\r\nfind out his mistake, and cut his throat from shame and vexation. One\r\nmay readily conceive Sydney Smith's enjoying this joke, for his spirits\r\nwere those of a boy: his gaiety was irresistible; his ringing laugh,\r\ninfectious; but it is difficult for those who knew Mackintosh in his\r\nlater years--the quiet, almost pensive invalid to realize in that\r\nremembrance any trace of the Mackintosh of Doughty Street and Orchard\r\nStreet days.\r\n\r\nOne day Sydney Smith came home with two hackney coaches full of\r\npictures, which he had picked up at an auction. His daughter thus tells\r\nthe story: 'Another day he came home with two hackney-coach loads of\r\npictures, which he had met with at an auction, having found it\r\nimpossible to resist so many yards of brown-looking figures and faded\r\nlandscapes going for \"absolutely nothing, unheard of sacrifices.\" \"Kate\"\r\nhardly knew whether to laugh or cry when she saw these horribly\r\ndingy-looking objects enter her pretty little drawing-room, and looked\r\nat him as if she thought him half mad; and half mad he was, but with\r\ndelight at his purchase. He kept walking up and down the room, waving\r\nhis arms, putting them in fresh lights, declaring they were exquisite\r\nspecimens of art, and if not by the very best masters, merited to be so.\r\nHe invited his friends, and displayed his pictures; discovered fresh\r\nbeauties for each new comer; and for three or four days, under the magic\r\ninfluence of his wit and imagination, these gloomy old pictures were a\r\nperpetual source of amusement and fun.'\r\n\r\nAt last, finding that he was considered no authority for the fine arts,\r\noff went the pictures to another auction, but all re-christened by\r\nhimself, with unheard-of names. 'One, I remember,' says Lady Holland,\r\n'was a beautiful landscape, by Nicholas de Falda, a pupil of Valdezzio,\r\nthe only painting by that eminent artist. The pictures sold, I believe,\r\nfor rather less than he gave for them under their original names, which\r\nwere probably as real as their assumed ones.'\r\n\r\nSydney Smith had long been styled by his friends the 'Bishop of\r\nMickleham,' in allusion to his visits to, and influence in, the house of\r\nhis friend, Richard Sharp, who had a cottage at that place. A piece of\r\nreal preferment was now his. This was the living of Foston-le-Clay, in\r\nYorkshire, given him by Lord Erskine, then Chancellor. Lady Holland\r\nnever rested till she had prevailed on Erskine to give Sydney Smith a\r\nliving. Smith, as Rogers relates, went to thank his lordship. 'Oh,' said\r\nErskine, 'don't thank me, Mr. Smith; I gave you the living because Lady\r\nHolland insisted on my doing so; and if she had desired me to give it to\r\nthe devil, _he_ must have had it.'\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the prediction of the saints, Sydney Smith proved an\r\nexcellent parish priest. Even his most admiring friends did not expect\r\nthis result. The general impression was, that he was infinitely better\r\nfitted for the bar than for the church. 'Ah! Mr. Smith,' Lord Stowell\r\nused to say to him, 'you would be in a far better situation, and a far\r\nricher man, had you belonged to us.'\r\n\r\nOne _jeu d'esprit_ more, and Smith hastened to take possession of his\r\nliving, and to enter upon duties of which no one better knew the mighty\r\nimportance than he did.\r\n\r\nAmong the Mackintosh set was Richard Sharp, to whom we have already\r\nreferred, termed, from his great knowledge and ready memory,\r\n'Conversation Sharp.' Many people may think that this did not imply an\r\nagreeable man, and they were, perhaps, right. Sharp was a plain,\r\nungainly man. One evening, a literary lady, now living, being at Sir\r\nJames Mackintosh's, in company with Sharp, Sismondi, and the late Lord\r\nDenman, then a man of middle age. Sir James was not only particularly\r\npartial to Denman, but admired him personally. 'Do you not think Denman\r\nhandsome?' he inquired of the lady after the guests were gone. 'No? Then\r\nyou must think Mr. Sharp handsome,' he rejoined; meaning that a taste so\r\nperverted as not to admire Denman must be smitten with Sharp. Sharp is\r\nsaid to have studied all the morning before he went out to dinner, to\r\nget up his wit and anecdote, as an actor does his part. Sydney Smith\r\nhaving one day received an invitation from him to dine at Fishmongers'\r\nHall, sent the following reply:--\r\n\r\n  'Much do I love\r\n  The monsters of the deep to eat;\r\n  To see the rosy salmon lying,\r\n  By smelts encircled, born for frying;\r\n  And from the china boat to pour\r\n  On flaky cod the flavoured shower.\r\n  Thee above all, I much regard,\r\n  Flatter than Longman's flattest bard,\r\n  Much-honour'd turbot! sore I grieve\r\n  Thee and thy dainty friends to leave.\r\n  Far from ye all, in snuggest corner,\r\n  I go to dine with little Horner;\r\n  He who with philosophic eye\r\n  Sat brooding o'er his Christmas pie;\r\n  Then firm resolved, with either thumb,\r\n  Tore forth the crust-enveloped plum;\r\n  And mad with youthful dreams of deathless fame,\r\n  Proclaimed the deathless glories of his name.'\r\n\r\nOne word before we enter on the subject of Sydney Smith's ministry. In\r\nthis biography of a great Wit, we touch but lightly upon the graver\r\nfeatures of his character, yet they cannot wholly be passed over. Stanch\r\nin his devotion to the Church of England, he was liberal to others. The\r\nworld in the present day is afraid of liberality. Let it not be\r\nforgotten that it has been the fanatic and the intolerant, not the mild\r\nand practical, among us who have gone from the Protestant to the Romish\r\nfaith. Sydney Smith, in common with other great men, had no predilection\r\nfor dealing damnation round the land. How noble, how true, are\r\nMackintosh's reflections on religious sects! 'It is impossible, I think,\r\nto look into the interior of any religious sect, without thinking better\r\nof it. I ought, indeed, to confine myself to those of Christian Europe,\r\nbut with that limitation it seems to me the remark is true; whether I\r\nlook at the Jansenists of Port Royal, or the Quakers in Clarkson, or the\r\nMethodists in these journals. All these sects, which appear dangerous or\r\nridiculous at a distance, assume a much more amicable character on\r\nnearer inspection. They all inculcate pure virtue, and practise mutual\r\nkindness; and they exert great force of reason in rescuing their\r\ndoctrines from the absurd or pernicious consequences which naturally\r\nflow from them. Much of this arises from the general nature of religious\r\nprinciple--much also from the genius of the Gospel.'\r\n\r\nNothing could present a greater contrast with the comforts of Orchard\r\nStreet than the place on which Sydney Smith's 'lines' had now 'fallen.'\r\nOwing to the non-residence of the clergy, one-third of the parsonage\r\nhouses in England had fallen into decay, but that of Foston-le-Clay was\r\npre-eminently wretched. A hovel represented what was still called the\r\nparsonage-house: it stood on a glebe of three hundred acres of the\r\nstiffest clay in Yorkshire: a brick-floored kitchen, with a room above\r\nit, both in a ruinous condition was the residence which, for a hundred\r\nand fifty years, had never been inhabited by an incumbent. It will not\r\nbe a matter of surprise that for some time, until 1808, Sydney Smith,\r\nwith the permission of the Archbishop of York, continued to reside in\r\nLondon, after having appointed a curate at Foston-le-Clay.\r\n\r\nThe first visit to his living was by no means promising. Picture to\r\nyourself, my reader, Sydney Smith in a carriage, in his superfine black\r\ncoat, driving into the remote village, and parleying with the old parish\r\nclerk, who after some conversation, observed, emphatically, shaking his\r\nstick on the ground, 'Master Smith, it stroikes me that people as comes\r\nfroe London is such _fools_.--'I see _you_ are no fool,' was the prompt\r\nanswer; and the parson and the clerk parted mutually satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe profits, arising from the sale of two volumes of sermons, carried\r\nSydney Smith, his family, and his furniture, to Foston-le-Clay in the\r\nsummer of 1809, and he took up his abode in a pleasant house about two\r\nmiles from York, at Heslington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SYDNEY SMITH'S WITTY ANSWER TO THE OLD PARISH CLERK.]\r\n\r\nLet us now, for a time, forget the wit, the editor of the 'Edinburgh\r\nReview,' the diner out, the evening preacher at the Foundling, and\r\nglance at the peaceful and useful life of a country clergyman. His\r\nspirits, his wit, all his social qualities, never deserted Sydney Smith,\r\neven in the retreat to which he was destined. Let us see him driving in\r\nhis second-hand carriage, his horse, 'Peter the Cruel,' with Mrs. Smith\r\nby his side, summer and winter, from Heslington to Foston-le-Clay. Mrs.\r\nSmith, at first, trembled at the inexperience of her charioteer; but\r\n'she soon,' said Sydney, 'raised my wages, and considered me an\r\nexcellent Jehu.' 'Mr. Brown,' said Sydney to one of the tradesmen of\r\nYork, through the streets of which he found it difficult to drive, 'your\r\nstreets are the narrowest, in Europe,'--'Narrow, sir? there's plenty of\r\nroom for two carriages to pass each other, and an inch and a half to\r\nspare!'\r\n\r\nLet us see him in his busy peaceful life, digging an hour or two every\r\nday in his garden to avoid sudden death, by preventing corpulency; then\r\ngalloping through a book, and when his family laughed at him for so soon\r\ndismissing a quarto, saying, 'Cross-examine me, then,' and going well\r\nthrough the ordeal. Hear him, after finishing his morning's writing,\r\nsaying to his wife, 'There, Kate, it's done: do look over it; put the\r\ndots to the i's, and cross the t's:' and off he went to his walk,\r\nsurrounded by his children, who were his companions and confidants. See\r\nhim in the lane, talking to an old woman whom he had taken into his gig\r\nas she was returning from market, and picking up all sorts of knowledge\r\nfrom her; or administering medicine to the poor, or to his horses and\r\nanimals, sometimes committing mistakes next to fatal. One day he\r\ndeclared he found all his pigs intoxicated, grunting 'God save the King'\r\nabout the sty. He nearly poisoned his red cow by an over-dose of\r\ncastor-oil; and Peter the Cruel, so called because the groom once said\r\nhe had a cruel face, took two boxes of opium pills (boxes and all) in\r\nhis mash, without ill consequences.\r\n\r\nSee him, too, rushing out after dinner--for he had a horror of long\r\nsittings after that meal--to look at his 'scratcher.'\r\n\r\nHe used to say, Lady Holland (his daughter) relates, 'I am all for cheap\r\nluxuries, even for animals; now all animals have a passion for\r\nscratching their backbones; they break down your gates and palings to\r\neffect this. Look! there is my universal scratcher, a sharp-edged pole,\r\nresting on a high and a low post, adapted to every height, from a horse\r\nto a lamb. Even the Edinburgh Reviewer can take his turn: you have no\r\nidea how popular it is; I have not had a gate broken since I put it up;\r\nI have it in all my fields.'\r\n\r\nThen his experiments were numerous. Mutton fat was to be burned instead\r\nof candles; and working-people were brought in and fed with broth, or\r\nwith rice, or with porridge, to see which was the most satisfying diet.\r\nEconomy was made amusing, benevolence almost absurd, but the humorous\r\nman, the kind man, shone forth in all things. He was one of the first,\r\nif not the first, who introduced allotment-gardens for the poor: he was\r\none who could truly say at the last, when he had lived sixty-six years,\r\n'I have done but very little harm in the world, and I have brought up my\r\nfamily.'\r\n\r\nWe have taken a glimpse--and a glimpse merely--of the 'wise Wit' in\r\nLondon, among congenial society, where every intellectual power was\r\ndaily called forth in combative force. See him now in the provincial\r\ncircles of the remote county of York. 'Did you ever,' he once asked,\r\n'dine out in the country? What misery do human beings inflict on each\r\nother under the name of pleasure!' Then he describes driving in a\r\nbroiling sun through a dusty road, to eat a haunch of venison at the\r\nhouse of a neighbouring parson. Assembled in a small house, 'redolent of\r\nfrying,' talked of roads, weather, and turnips; began, that done, to be\r\nhungry. A stripling, caught up for the occasion, calls the master of the\r\nhouse out of the room, and announces that the cook has mistaken the soup\r\nfor dirty water, and has thrown it away. No help for it--agreed; they\r\nmust do without it; perhaps as well they should. Dinner announced; they\r\nenter the dining-room: heavens! what a gale! the venison is high!\r\n\r\nVarious other adverse incidents occur, and the party return home,\r\ngrateful to the post-boys for not being drunk, and thankful to\r\nProvidence for not being thrown into a wet ditch.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these troubles and risks, there was an enemy at hand to\r\napprehend--prejudice. The Squire of Heslington--'the last of the\r\nSquires'--regarded Mr. Smith as a Jacobin; and his lady, 'who looked as\r\nif she had walked straight out of the Ark, or had been the wife of\r\nEnoch,' used to turn aside as he passed. When, however, the squire found\r\n'the peace of the village undisturbed, harvests as usual, his dogs\r\nuninjured, he first bowed, then called, and ended by a pitch of\r\nconfidence;' actually discovered that Sydney Smith had made a joke;\r\nnearly went into convulsions of laughter, and finished by inviting the\r\n'dangerous fellow,' as he had once thought him, to see his dogs.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 Sydney Smith removed, as he thought it his duty to do, to\r\nFoston-le-Clay, and, 'not knowing a turnip from a carrot,' began to farm\r\nthree hundred acres, and not having any money, to build a\r\nparsonage-house.\r\n\r\nIt was a model parsonage, he thought, the plan being formed by himself\r\nand 'Kate.' Being advised by his neighbours to purchase oxen, he bought\r\n(and christened) four oxen, 'Tug and Lug,' 'Crawl and Haul.' But Tug and\r\nLug took to fainting, Haul and Crawl to lie down in the mud, so he was\r\ncompelled to sell them, and to purchase a team of horses.\r\n\r\nThe house plunged him into debt for twenty years; and a man-servant\r\nbeing too expensive, the 'wise Wit' caught up a country girl, made like\r\na mile-stone, and christened her 'Bunch,' and Bunch became the best\r\nbutler in the county.\r\n\r\nHe next set up a carriage, which he christened the 'Immortal,' for it\r\ngrew, from being only an ancient green chariot, supposed to have been\r\nthe earliest invention of the kind, to be known by all the neighbours;\r\nthe village dogs barked at it, the village boys cheered it, and 'we had\r\nno false shame.'\r\n\r\nOne could linger over the annals of Sydney Smith's useful, happy life at\r\nFoston-le-Clay, visited there indeed by Mackintosh, and each day\r\nachieving a higher and higher reputation in literature. We see him as a\r\nmagistrate, 'no friend to game,' as a country squire in Suffolk solemnly\r\nsaid of a neighbour, but a friend to man; with a pitying heart, that\r\nforbade him to commit young delinquents to gaol, though he would lecture\r\nthem severely, and call out, in bad cases, 'John, bring me out my\r\n_private gallows_,' which brought the poor boys on their knees. We\r\nbehold him making visits, and even tours, in the 'Immortal,' and\r\nreceiving Lord and Lady Carlisle in their coach and four, which had\r\nstuck in the middle of a ploughed field, there being scarcely any road,\r\nonly a lane up to the house. Behold him receiving his poor friend,\r\nFrancis Homer, who came to take his last leave of him, and died at Pisa,\r\nin 1817, after earning honours, paid, as Sir James Mackintosh remarked,\r\nto intrinsic claims alone--'a man of obscure birth, who never filled an\r\noffice.' See Sydney Smith, in 1816, from the failure of the harvest (he\r\nwho was in London 'a walking patty'), sitting down with his family to\r\nrepast without bread, thin, unleavened cakes being the substitute. See\r\nhis cheerfulness, his submission to many privations: picture him to\r\nourselves trying to ride, but falling off incessantly; but obliged to\r\nleave off riding 'for the good of his family, and the peace of his\r\nparish' (he had christened his horse, 'Calamity'). See him suddenly\r\nprostrate from that steed in the midst of the streets of York, 'to the\r\ngreat joy of Dissenters,' he declares: another time flung as if he had\r\nbeen a shuttlecock, into a neighbouring parish, very glad that it was\r\nnot a neighbouring planet, for somehow or other his horse and he had a\r\n'trick of parting company.' 'I used,' he wrote, 'to think a fall from a\r\nhorse dangerous, but much experience has convinced me to the contrary. I\r\nhave had six falls in two years, and just behaved like the Three per\r\nCents., when they fell--I got up again, and am not a bit the worse for\r\nit, any more than the stock in question.'\r\n\r\nThis country life was varied by many visits. In 1820 he went to visit\r\nLord Grey, then to Edinburgh, to Jeffrey travelling by the coach, a\r\ngentleman, with whom he had been talking, said, 'There is a very clever\r\nfellow lives near here, Sydney Smith, I believe; a devilish odd\r\nfellow.'--'He may be an odd fellow,' cried Sydney, taking off his hat,\r\n'but here he is, odd as he is, at your service.'\r\n\r\nSydney Smith found great changes in Edinburgh--changes, however, in many\r\nrespects for the better. The society of Edinburgh was then in its\r\ngreatest perfection. 'Its brilliancy, Lord Cockburn remarks, 'was owing\r\nto a variety of peculiar circumstances, which only operated during this\r\nperiod. The principal of these were the survivance of several of the\r\neminent men of the preceding age, and of curious old habits, which the\r\nmodern flood had not yet obliterated; the rise of a powerful community\r\nof young men of ability; the exclusion of the British from the\r\nContinent, which made this place, both for education and for residence,\r\na favourite resort of strangers; the war, which maintained a constant\r\nexcitement of military preparation and of military idleness: the blaze\r\nof that popular literature which made this the second city in the empire\r\nfor learning and science; and the extent and the ease with which\r\nliterature and society embellished each other, without rivalry, and\r\nwithout pedantry.\r\n\r\nAmong the 'best young' as his lordship styles them, were Lord Webb\r\nSeymour and Francis Horner; whilst those of the 'interesting old' most\r\nnoted were Elizabeth Hamilton and Mrs. Grant of Laggan, who had\r\n'unfolded herself,' to borrow Lord Cockburn's words, in the 'Letters\r\nfrom the Mountains,' 'an interesting treasury of good solitary\r\nthoughts.' Of these two ladies, Lord Cockburn says, 'They were excellent\r\nwomen, and not _too_ blue. Their sense covered the colour.' It was to\r\nMrs. Hamilton that Jeffrey said, 'That there was no objection to the\r\nblue stocking, provided the petticoat came low enough to cover it.'\r\nNeither of these ladies possessed personal attractions. Mrs. Hamilton\r\nhad the plain face proper to literary women; Mrs. Grant was a tall dark\r\nwoman, with much dignity of manner: in spite of her life of misfortune,\r\nshe had a great flow of spirits. Beautifully, indeed, does Lord Cockburn\r\nrender justice to her character: 'She was always under the influence of\r\nan affectionate and delightful enthusiasm, which, unquenched by time and\r\nsorrow, survived the wreck of many domestic attachments, and shed a glow\r\nover the close of a very protracted life.'\r\n\r\nBoth she and Mrs. Hamilton succeeded in drawing to their\r\n_conversazioni_, in small rooms of unpretending style, men of the\r\nhighest order, as well as attractive women of intelligence. Society in\r\nEdinburgh took the form of Parisian _soirées_, and although much divided\r\ninto parties, was sufficiently general to be varied. It is amusing to\r\nfind that Mrs. Grant was at one time one of the supposed 'Authors of\r\n\"Waverley,\"' until the disclosure of the mystery silenced reports. It\r\nwas the popularity of 'Marmion,' that made Scott, as he himself\r\nconfesses, nearly lose his footing. Mrs. Grant's observation on him,\r\nafter meeting the Great Unknown at some brilliant party, has been\r\nallowed, even by the sarcastic Lockhart, to be 'witty enough.' 'Mr.\r\nScott always seems to me to be like a glass, through which the rays of\r\nadmiration pass without sensibly affecting it; but the bit of paper[13]\r\nthat lies beside it will presently be in a blaze--and no wonder.'\r\n\r\n[13: Alluding to Lady Scott.]\r\n\r\nScott endeavoured to secure Mrs. Grant a pension; merited as he\r\nobserves, by her as an authoress, 'but much more,' in his opinion, 'by\r\nthe firmness and elasticity of mind with which she had borne a great\r\nsuccession of domestic calamities.' 'Unhappily,' he adds, 'there was\r\nonly about £100 open on the Pension List, and this the minister assigned\r\nin equal portions to Mrs. G---- and a distressed lady, grand-daughter of\r\na forfeited Scottish nobleman. Mrs. G---- , proud as a Highlandwoman,\r\nvain as a poetess, and absurd as a blue-stocking, has taken this\r\npartition in _malam partem_, and written to Lord Melville about her\r\nmerits, and that her friends do not consider her claims as being fairly\r\ncanvassed, with something like a demand that her petition be submitted\r\nto the king. This is not the way to make her _plack_ a _bawbee_, and\r\nLord M---- , a little _miffed_ in turn, sends the whole correspondence\r\nto me to know whether Mrs. G---- will accept the £50 or not\r\n\r\nNow, hating to deal with ladies when they are in an unreasonable humour,\r\nI have got the good-humoured Man of Feeling to find out the lady's mind,\r\nand I take on myself the task of making her peace with Lord M---- .\r\nAfter all, the poor lady is greatly to be pitied:--her sole remaining\r\ndaughter deep and far gone in a decline.'\r\n\r\nThe Man of Feeling proved successful, and reported soon afterwards that\r\nthe 'dirty pudding' was eaten by the almost destitute authoress. Scott's\r\ntone in the letters which refer to this subject does little credit to\r\nhis good taste and delicacy of feeling, which were really attributable\r\nto his character.\r\n\r\nVery few notices occur of any intercourse between Scott and Sydney Smith\r\nin Lockhart's 'Life,' It was not, indeed, until 1827 that Scott could be\r\nsufficiently cooled down from the ferment of politics which had been\r\ngoing on to meet Jeffrey and Cockburn. When he dined, however, with\r\nMurray, then Lord Advocate, and met Jeffrey, Cockburn, the late Lord\r\nRutherford, then Mr. Rutherford, and others of 'that file,' he\r\npronounced the party to be 'very pleasant, capital good cheer, and\r\nexcellent wine, much laugh and fun. I do not know,' he writes, 'how it\r\nis, but when I am out with a party of my Opposition friends, the day is\r\noften merrier than when with our own set. It is because they are\r\ncleverer? Jeffery and Harry Cockburn are, to be sure, very extraordinary\r\nmen, yet it is not owing to that entirely. I believe both parties meet\r\nwith the feeling of something like novelty. We have not worn out our\r\njests in daily contact. There is also a disposition on such occasions to\r\nbe courteous, and of course to be pleased.'\r\n\r\nOn his side, Cockburn did ample justice to the 'genius who,' to use his\r\nown words, 'has immortalized Edinburgh and delighted the 'world.' Mrs.\r\nScott could not, however, recover the smarting inflicted by the\r\ncritiques of Jeffrey on her husband's works. Her--'And I hope, Mr.\r\nJeffrey, Mr. Constable paid you well for your Article' (Jeffrey dining\r\nwith her that day), had a depth of simple satire in it that ever, an\r\nEdinburgh Reviewer could hardly exceed. It was, one must add,\r\nimpertinent and in bad taste. 'You are very good at cutting up.'\r\n\r\nSydney Smith found Jeffrey and Cockburn rising barristers. Horner, on\r\nleaving Edinburgh, had left to Jeffrey his bar wig, and the bequest had\r\nbeen lucky. Jeffrey was settled at Craigcrook, a lovely English-looking\r\nspot, with wooded slopes and green glades, near Edinburgh; and Cockburn\r\nhad, since 1811, set up his rural gods at Bonally, near Colinton, just\r\nunder the Pentland Hills, and he wrote, 'Unless some avenging angel\r\nshall expel me, I shall never leave that paradise.' And a paradise it\r\nwas. Beneath those rough, bare hills, broken here and there by a\r\ntrickling burn, like a silver thread on the brown sward, stands a Norman\r\ntower, the addition, by Playfair's skill, to what was once a scarcely\r\nhabitable farmhouse. That tower contained Lord Cockburn's fine library,\r\nalso his ordinary sitting-rooms. There he read and wrote, and received\r\nsuch society as will never meet again, there or elsewhere--amongst them\r\nSydney Smith. Beneath--around the tower--stretches a delicious garden,\r\ncomposed of terraces, and laurel-hedged walks, and beds of flowers, that\r\nbloomed freely in that sheltered spot. A bowling-green, shaded by one of\r\nthe few trees near the house, a sycamore, was the care of many an hour;\r\nfor to make the turf velvety, the sods were fetched from the hills\r\nabove--from 'yon hills,' as Lord Cockburn would have called them. And\r\nthis was for many years one of the rallying points of the best Scottish\r\nsociety, and, as each autumn came round, of what the host called his\r\nCarnival. Friends were summoned from the north and the south--'death no\r\napology.' High jinks within doors, excursions without. Every Edinburgh\r\nman reveres the spot, hallowed by the remembrance of Lord Cockburn.\r\n'Every thing except the two burns, he wrote, 'the few old trees, and the\r\nmountains, are my own work. Human nature is incapable of enjoying more\r\nhappiness than has been my lot here. I have been too happy, and often\r\ntremble in the anticipation that the cloud must come at last.' And come\r\nit did; but found him not unprepared, although the burden that he had to\r\nbear in after-life was heavy. In their enlarged and philosophic minds,\r\nin their rapid transition from sense to nonsense, there was an affinity\r\nin the characters of Sydney Smith and of Lord Cockburn which was not\r\ncarried out in any other point. Smith's conversation was wit--Lord\r\nCockburn's was eloquence.\r\n\r\nFrom the festivities of Edinburgh Sydney Smith returned contentedly to\r\nFoston-le-Clay, and to Bunch. Amongst other gifted visitors was Mrs.\r\nMarcet. 'Come here, Bunch,' cries Sydney Smith one day; 'come and repeat\r\nyour crimes to Mrs. Marcet.' Then Bunch, grave as a judge, began to\r\nrepeat: 'Plate-snatching, gravy-spilling, door-slamming, blue-bottle-\r\nfly-catching, and curtsey-bobbing. 'Blue-bottle-fly-catching,' means\r\nstanding with her mouth open, and not attending; and 'curtsey-bobbing'\r\nwas curtseying to the centre of the earth.\r\n\r\nOne night, in the winter, during a tremendous snowstorm, Bunch rushed\r\nin, exclaiming, 'Lord and Lady Mackincrush is com'd in a coach and\r\nfour.' The lord and lady proved to be Sir James and his daughter, who\r\nhad arrived to stay with his friends in the remote parsonage of\r\nFoston-le-Clay a few days, and had sent a letter, which arrived the day\r\nafterwards to announce their visit. Their stay began with a blunder; and\r\nwhen Sir James departed, leaving kind feelings behind him--books, his\r\nhat, his gloves, his papers and other articles of apparel were found\r\nalso. 'What a man that would be,' said Sydney Smith, 'had he one\r\nparticle of gall, or the least knowledge of the value of red tape!' It\r\nwas true that the indolent, desultory character of Mackintosh interfered\r\nperpetually with his progress in the world. He loved far better to lie\r\non the sofa reading a novel than to attend a Privy Council; the\r\nslightest indisposition was made on his part a plea for avoiding the\r\nmost important business.\r\n\r\nSydney Smith had said that 'when a clever man takes to cultivating\r\nturnips and retiring, it is generally an imposture;' but in him the\r\nretirement was no imposture. His wisdom shone forth daily in small and\r\ngreat matters. 'Life,' he justly thought, 'was to be fortified by many\r\nfriendships,' and he acted up to his principles, and kept up friendships\r\nby letters. Cheerfulness he thought might be cultivated by making the\r\nrooms one lives in as comfortable as possible. His own drawing-room was\r\npapered on this principle, with a yellow flowering pattern; and filled\r\nwith 'irregular regularities;' his fires were blown into brightness by\r\n_Shadrachs_, as he called them--tubes furnished with air opening in the\r\ncentre of each fire, His library contained his rheumatic armour: for he\r\ntried heat and compression in rheumatism; put his legs into narrow\r\nbuckets, which he called his jack-boots; wore round his throat a tin\r\ncollar; over each shoulder he had a large tin thing like a shoulder of\r\nmutton; and on his head he displayed a hollow helmet filled with hot\r\nwater. In the middle of a field into which his windows looked, was a\r\nskeleton sort of a machine, his Universal Scratcher; with which every\r\nanimal from a lamb to a bullock could scratch itself. Then on the Sunday\r\nthe Immortal was called into use, to travel in state to a church like a\r\nbarn; about fifty people in it; but the most original idea was farming\r\nthrough the medium of a tremendous speaking-trumpet from his own door,\r\nwith its companion, a telescope, to see what his people are about! On\r\nthe 24th of January, 1828, the first notable piece of preferment was\r\nconferred on him by Lord Lyndhurst then Chancellor, and of widely\r\ndiffering political opinions to Sydney Smith. This was a vacant stall in\r\nthe cathedral at Bristol, where on the ensuing 5th of November, the new\r\ncanon gave the Mayor and Corporation of that Protestant city such a dose\r\nof 'toleration as should last them many a year.' He went to Court on his\r\nappointment, and appeared in shoestrings instead of buckles. 'I found,'\r\nhe relates, 'to my surprise, people looking down at my feet: I could not\r\nthink what they were at. At first I thought they had discovered the\r\nbeauty of my legs; but at last the truth burst on me, by some wag\r\nlaughing and thinking I had done it as a good joke. I was, of course,\r\nexceedingly annoyed to have been supposed capable of such a vulgar\r\nunmeaning piece of disrespect, and kept my feet as coyly under my\r\npetticoats as the veriest prude in the country till I should make my\r\nescape.' His circumstances were now improved, and though moralists, he\r\nsaid, thought property an evil, he declared himself happier every guinea\r\nhe gained. He thanked God for his animal spirits, which received,\r\nunhappily, in 1829, a terrible shock from the death of his eldest son,\r\nDouglas, aged twenty-four. This was the great misfortune of his life;\r\nthe young man was promising, talented, affectionate. He exchanged\r\nFoston-le-Clay at this time for a living in Somersetshire, of a\r\nbeautiful and characteristic name--Combe Florey.\r\n\r\nCombe Florey seems to have been an earthly paradise, seated in one of\r\nthose delicious hollows or in Combes, for which that part of the west of\r\nEngland is celebrated. His withdrawal from the Edinburgh\r\nReview--Mackintosh's death--the marriage of his eldest daughter, Saba,\r\nto Dr. Holland (now Sir Henry Holland)--the termination of Lord Grey's\r\nAdministration, which ended Sydney's hopes of being a bishop, were the\r\nleading events of his life for the next few years.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Sydney Smith felt to the hour of his death pained that\r\nthose by whose side he had fought for fifty years, in their adversity,\r\nthe Whig party, should never have offered what he declared he should\r\nhave rejected, a bishopric, when they were constantly bestowing such\r\npromotions on persons of mediocre talent and claims. Waiving the point,\r\nwhether it is right or wrong to make men bishops because they have been\r\npolitical partizans, the cause of this alleged injustice may be found in\r\nthe tone of the times, which was eminently tinctured with cant. The\r\nClapham sect were in the ascendancy; and Ministers scarcely dared to\r\noffend so influential a body. Even the gentle Sir James Mackintosh\r\nrefers, in his Journal, with disgust to the phraseology of the day:--\r\n\r\n'They have introduced a new language, in which they never say that A. B.\r\nis good, or virtuous, or even religious; but that he is an \"advanced\r\nChristian.\" Dear Mr. Wilberforce is an \"advanced Christian.\" Mrs. C. has\r\nlost three children without a pang, and is so \"advanced a Christian\"\r\nthat she could see the remaining twenty, \"with poor dear Mr. C.,\"\r\nremoved with perfect tranquillity.'\r\n\r\nSuch was the disgust expressed towards that school by Mackintosh, whose\r\nlast days were described by his daughter as having been passed in\r\nsilence and thought, with his Bible before him, breaking that\r\nsilence--and portentous silence--to speak of God, and of his Maker's\r\ndisposition towards man.\r\n\r\nHis mind ceased to be occupied with speculations; politics interested\r\nhim no more. His own 'personal relationship to his Creator' was the\r\nsubject of his thoughts. Yet Mackintosh was not by any means considered\r\nas an advanced Christian, or even as a Christian at all by the zealots\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\nSydney Smith's notions of a bishop were certainly by no means carried\r\nout in his own person and character. 'I never remember in my time,' he\r\nsaid, 'a real bishop: a grave, elderly man, full of Greek, with sound\r\nviews of the middle voice and preterpluperfect tense; gentle and kind to\r\nhis poor clergy, of powerful and commanding eloquence in Parliament,\r\nnever to be put down when the great interests of mankind were concerned,\r\nleaning to the Government when it was right, leaning to the people when\r\nthey were right; feeling that if the Spirit of God had called him to\r\nthat high office, he was called for no mean purpose, but rather that\r\nseeing clearly, acting boldly, and intending purely, he might confer\r\nlasting benefit upon mankind.'\r\n\r\nIn 1831 Lord Grey appointed Sydney Smith a Canon Resilentiary of St.\r\nPaul's; but still the mitre was withheld, although it has since appeared\r\nthat Lord Grey had destined him for one of the first vacancies in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHenceforth his residence at St. Paul's brought him still more\r\ncontinually into the world, which he delighted by his 'wise wit.' Most\r\nLondon dinners, he declared, evaporated in whispers to one's next\r\nneighbours. He never, however, spoke to his neighbour, but 'fired'\r\nacross the table. One day, however, he broke his rule, on hearing a\r\nlady, who sat next him, say in a sweet low voice, 'No gravy,\r\nsir.'--'Madam!' he cried, 'I have all my life been looking for a person\r\nwho disliked gravy, let us swear immortal friendship.' She looked\r\nastonished, but took the oath, and kept it. 'What better foundation for\r\nfriendship,' he asks, 'than similarity of tastes?'\r\n\r\nHe gave an evening party once a week; when a profusion of wax-lights was\r\nhis passion. He loved to see young people decked with natural flowers;\r\nhe was, in fact, a blameless and benevolent Epicurean in everything;\r\ngreat indeed was the change from his former residence at Foston, which\r\nhe used to say was twelve miles from a lemon. Charming as his parties at\r\nhome must have been, they wanted the _bon-hommie_ and simplicity of\r\nformer days, and Of the homely suppers in Orchard Street. Lord Dudley,\r\nRogers, Moore, 'Young Macaulay,' as he was called for many years, formed\r\nnow his society. Lord Dudley was then in the state which afterwards\r\nbecame insanity, and darkened completely a mind sad and peculiar from\r\nchildhood. Bankes, in his 'Journal,' relates an anecdote of him about\r\nthis time, when, as he says, 'Dudley's mind was on the wane; but still\r\nhis caustic humour would find vent through the cloud which was gradually\r\nover-shadowing his masterly intellect.' He was one day sitting in his\r\nroom soliloquizing aloud; his favourite Newfoundland-dog was at his\r\nside, and seemed to engross all ----m's attention. A gentleman was\r\npresent who was good-looking and good-natured, but not overburthened\r\nwith sense. Lord Dudley at last, patting his dog's head, said, 'Fido\r\nmio, they say dogs have no souls. Humph, and still they say ----'\r\n(naming the gentleman present) 'has a soul!' One day Lord Dudley met Mr.\r\nAllen, Lord Holland's librarian, and asked him to dine with him. Allen\r\nwent. When asked to describe his dinner, he said, 'There was no one\r\nthere. Lord Dudley talked a little to his servant, and a great deal to\r\nhis dog, but said not one word to me.'\r\n\r\nInnumerable are the witticisms related of Sydney Smith, when seated at a\r\ndinner table--having swallowed in life what he called a 'Caspian Sea' of\r\nsoup. Talking one day of Sir Charles Lyell's book, the subject of which\r\nwas the phenomena which the earth might, at some future period, present\r\nto the geologists. 'Let us imagine,' he said, 'an excavation on the site\r\nof St. Paul's; fancy a lecture by the Owen of his future era on the\r\nthigh-bone of a minor canon, or the tooth of a dean: the form,\r\nqualities, and tastes he would discover from them.' 'It is a great proof\r\nof shyness,' he said, 'to crumble your bread at dinner. Ah! I see,' he\r\nsaid, turning to a young lady, 'you're afraid of me: you crumble your\r\nbread. I do it when I sit by the Bishop of London, and with both hands\r\nwhen I sit by the Archbishop.'\r\n\r\nBe gave a capital reproof to a lively young M.P. who was accompanying\r\nhim after dinner to one of the solemn evening receptions at Lambeth\r\nPalace during the life of the late Archbishop of Canterbury. The M.P.\r\nhad been calling him 'Smith,' though they had never met before that day.\r\nAs the carriage stopped at the Palace, Smith turned to him and said,\r\n'Now don't, my good fellow, don't call the Archbishop \"Howley.\"'\r\n\r\nTalking of fancy-balls--'Of course,' he said, 'if I went to one, I\r\nshould go as a Dissenter.' Of Macaulay, he said, 'To take him out of\r\nliterature and science, and to put him in the House of Commons, is like\r\ntaking the chief physician out of London in a pestilence.'\r\n\r\nNothing amused him so much as the want of perception of a joke. One hot\r\nday a Mrs. Jackson called on him, and spoke of the oppressive state of\r\nthe weather. 'Heat! it was dreadful,' said Sydney; 'I found I could do\r\nnothing for it but take off my flesh and sit in my bones.' 'Take off\r\nyour flesh and sit in your bones! Oh, Mr. Smith! how could you do that?'\r\nthe lady cried. 'Come and see next time, ma'am--nothing more easy.' She\r\nwent away, however, convinced that such a proceeding was very\r\nunorthodox. No wonder, with all his various acquirements, it should be\r\nsaid of him that no 'dull dinners were ever remembered in his company.'\r\n\r\nA happy old age concluded his life, at once brilliant and useful. To the\r\nlast he never considered his education as finished. His wit, a friend\r\nsaid, 'was always fresh, always had the dew on it. He latterly got into\r\nwhat Lord Jeffrey called the vicious habit of water drinking. Wine, he\r\nsaid, destroyed his understanding. He even 'forgot the number of the\r\nMuses, and thought it was thirty-nine, of course.' He agreed with Sir\r\nJames Mackintosh that he had found the world more good and more foolish\r\nthan he had thought when young. He took a cheerful view of all things;\r\nhe thanked God for small as well as great things, even for tea. 'I am\r\nglad,' he used to say, 'I was not born before tea.' His domestic\r\naffections were strong, and were heartily reciprocated.\r\n\r\nGeneral society he divided into classes: 'The noodles--very numerous and\r\nwell known. The affliction woman--a valuable member of society,\r\ngenerally an ancient spinster in small circumstances, who packs up her\r\nbag and sets off in cases of illness or death, \"to comfort, flatter,\r\nfetch, and carry.\" The up-takers--people who see, from their fingers'\r\nends and go through a room touching everything. The clearers--who begin\r\nat a dish and go on tasting and eating till it is finished. The\r\nsheep-walkers--who go on for ever on the beaten track. The\r\nlemon-squeezers of society--who act on you as a wet blanket; see a cloud\r\nin sunshine; the nails of the coffin in the ribbons of a bride;\r\nextinguish all hope; people, whose very look sets your teeth on an edge.\r\nThe let-well-aloners, cousin-german to the noodles--yet a variety, and\r\nwho are afraid to act, and think it safer to stand still. Then the\r\nwasherwomen--very numerous! who always say, \"Well, if ever I put on my\r\nbest bonnet, 'tis sure to rain,\" &c.\r\n\r\n'Besides this there is a very large class of people always treading on\r\nyour gouty foot, or talking in your deaf ear, or asking you to give them\r\nsomething with your lame hand,' &c.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn of the year 1844, Sydney Smith felt the death-stroke\r\napproaching. 'I am so weak, both in body and mind,' he said, 'that I\r\nbelieve if the knife were put into my hand, I should not have strength\r\nenough to stick it into a Dissenter.' In October he became seriously\r\nill. 'Ah! Charles,' he said to General Fox (when he was being kept very\r\nlow), 'I wish they would allow me even the wing of a roasted butterfly,'\r\nHe dreaded sorrowful faces around him; but confided to his old servant,\r\nAnnie Kay--and to her alone--his sense of his danger.\r\n\r\nAlmost the last person Sydney Smith saw was his beloved brother Bobus,\r\nwho followed him to the grave a fortnight after he had been laid in the\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\nHe lingered till the 22nd of February, 1845. His son closed his eyes.\r\nHis last act was, bestowing on a poverty-stricken clergyman a living.\r\n\r\nHe was buried at Kensal Green, where his eldest son, Douglas, had been\r\ninterred.\r\n\r\nIt has been justly and beautifully said of Sydney Smith, that\r\nChristianity was not a dogma with him, but a practical and most\r\nbeneficent rule of life.\r\n\r\nAs a clergyman, he was liberal, practical, staunch; free from the\r\nlatitudinarian principles of Hoadley, as from the bigotry of Laud. His\r\nwit was the wit of a virtuous, a decorous man; it had pungency without\r\nvenom; humour without indelicacy; and was copious without being\r\ntiresome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE BUBB DODINGTON, LORD MELCOMBE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dinner-giving lordly Poet.--A Misfortune for a Man of Society.--\r\nBrandenburgh House.--'The Diversions of the Morning.'--Johnson's Opinion\r\nof Foote--Churchill and 'The Rosciad.'--Personal Ridicule in its Proper\r\nLight.--Wild Specimen of the Poet.--Walpole on Dodington's 'Diary.'--The\r\nbest Commentary on a Man's Life.--Leicester House.--Grace Boyle,--Elegant\r\nModes of passing Time.--A sad Day.--What does Dodington come here for?--\r\nThe Veteran Wit, Beau, and Politician.--'Defend us from our Executors\r\nand Editors.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would have been well for Lord Melcombe's memory, Horace Walpole\r\nremarks, 'if his fame had been suffered to rest on the tradition of his\r\nwit, and the evidence of his poetry.' And in the present day, that\r\ndesirable result has come to pass. We remember Bubb Dodington chiefly as\r\nthe courtier whose person, houses, and furniture were replete with\r\ncostly ostentation, so as to provoke the satire of Foote, who brought\r\nhim on the stage under the name of Sir Thomas Lofty in 'The Patron,'\r\n\r\nWe recall him most as '_l'Amphytrion chez qui on dine_;' 'My Lord of\r\nMelcombe,' as Mallet says--\r\n\r\n  'Whose soups and sauces duly season'd,\r\n  Whose wit well tim'd and sense well reason'd,\r\n  Give Burgundy a brighter stain,\r\n  And add new flavour to Champagne.'\r\n\r\nWho now cares much for the court intrigues which severed Sir Robert\r\nWalpole and Bubb Dodington? Who now reads without disgust the annals of\r\nthat famous quarrel between George II. and his son, during which each\r\nparty devoutly wished the other dead? Who minds whether the time-serving\r\nBubb Dodington went over to Lord Bute or not? Who cares whether his\r\nhopes of political preferment were or were not gratified? Bubb Dodington\r\nwas, in fact, the dinner-giving lordly poet, to whom even the saintly\r\nYoung could write:--\r\n\r\n  'You give protection,--I a worthless strain.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1691, the accomplished courtier answered, till he had attained\r\nthe age of twenty-nine, to the not very euphonious name of Bubb. Then a\r\nbenevolent uncle with a large estate died, and left him, with his lands,\r\nthe more exalted surname of Dodington. He sprang, however, from an\r\nobscure family, who had settled in Dorchester; but that disadvantage,\r\nwhich, according to Lord Brougham's famous pamphlet, acts so fatally on\r\na young man's advancement in English public life, was obviated, as most\r\nthings are, by a great fortune.\r\n\r\nMr. Bubb had been educated at Oxford: at the age of twenty-four he was\r\nelected M.P. for Winchelsea; he was soon afterwards named Envoy at the\r\nCourt of Spain, but returned home after his accession of wealth to\r\nprovincial honours, and became Lord-Lieutenant of Somerset. Nay, poets\r\nbegan to worship him, and even pronounced him to be well born:--\r\n\r\n  'Descended from old British sires;\r\n  Great Dodington to kings allied;\r\n  My patron then, my laurels' pride.\r\n\r\nIt would be consolatory to find that it is only Welsted who thus\r\nprofaned the Muse by this abject flattery, were it not recorded that\r\nThomson dedicated to him his 'Summer.' The dedication was prompted by\r\nLord Binning; and 'Summer' was published in 1727 when Dodington was one\r\nof the Lords of the Treasury, as well as Clerk of the Pells in Ireland,\r\nIt seemed, therefore, worth while for Thomson to pen such a passage as\r\nthis:--'Your example sir, has recommended poetry with the greatest grace\r\nto the example of those who are engag'd in the most active scenes of\r\nlife; and this, though confessedly the least considerable of those\r\nqualities that dignify your character, must be particularly pleasing to\r\n_one_ whose only hope of being introduced to your regard is thro' the\r\nrecommendation of an art in which you are a master.' Warton adding this\r\ntribute:--\r\n\r\n  'To praise a Dodington rash bard! forbear.\r\n  What can thy weak and ill-tun'd voice avail,\r\n  When on that theme both Young and Thomson fail?'\r\n\r\nYet even when midway in his career, Dodington, in the famous political\r\ncaricature called 'The Motion,' is depicted as 'the Spaniel,' sitting\r\nbetween the Duke of Argyle's legs, whilst his grace is driving a coach\r\nat full speed to the Treasury, with a sword instead of a whip in his\r\nhand, with Lord Chesterfield as postilion, and Lord Cobham as a footman,\r\nholding on by the straps: even then the servile though pompous character\r\nof this true man of the world was comprehended completely; and Bubb\r\nDodington's characteristics never changed.\r\n\r\nIn his political life, Dodington was so selfish, obsequious, and\r\nversatile as to incur universal opprobrium; he had also another\r\nmisfortune for a man of society,--he became fat and lethargic. 'My\r\nbrother Ned' Horace Walpole remarks, 'says he is grown of less\r\nconsequence, though more weight.' And on another occasion, speaking of a\r\nmajority in the House of Lords, he adds, 'I do not count Dodington, who\r\nmust now always be in the minority, for no majority will accept him.'\r\n\r\nWhilst, however, during the factious reign of George II., the town was\r\ndeclared, even by Horace to be wondrous dull; operas unfrequented, plays\r\nnot in fashion, and amours old as marriages. Bubb Dodington, with his\r\nwealth and profusion, contrived always to be in vogue as a host, while\r\nhe was at a discount as a politician. Politics and literature are the\r\nhighroads in England to that much-craved-for distinction, an admittance\r\ninto the great world; and Dodington united these passports in his own\r\nperson: he was a poetaster, and wrote political pamphlets. The latter\r\nwere published and admired: the poems were referred to as 'very pretty\r\nlove verses,' by Lord Lyttelton, and were never published--and never\r\nought to have been published, it is stated.\r\n\r\nHis _bon mots_, his sallies, his fortunes and places, and continual\r\ndangling at court, procured Bubo, as Pope styled him, one pre-eminence.\r\nHis dinners at Hammersmith were the most _recherchés_ in the metropolis.\r\nEvery one remembers Brandenburgh House, when the hapless Caroline of\r\nBrunswick held her court there, and where her brave heart,--burdened\r\nprobably with some sins, as well as with endless regrets,--broke at\r\nlast. It had been the residence of the beautiful and famous Margravine\r\nof Anspach, whose loveliness in vain tempts us to believe her innocent,\r\nin despite of facts. Before those eras--the presence of the Margravine,\r\nwhose infidelities were almost avowed, and the abiding of the queen,\r\nwhose errors had, at all events, verged on the very confines of\r\nguilt--the house was owned by Dodington. There he gave dinners; there he\r\ngratified a passion for display, which was puerile; there he indulged in\r\neccentricities which almost implied insanity; there he concocted his\r\nschemes for court advancement; and there, later in life, he contributed\r\nsome of the treasures of his wit to dramatic literature. 'The Wishes,' a\r\ncomedy, by Bentley, was supposed to owe much of its point to the\r\nbrilliant wit of Dodington[14].\r\n\r\n[14: See Walpole's 'Royal and Noble Authors']\r\n\r\nAt Brandenburgh House, a nobler presence than that of Dodington still\r\nhaunted the groves and alleys, for Prince Rupert had once owned it. When\r\nDodington bought it, he gave it--in jest, we must presume--the name of\r\nLa Trappe; and it was not called Brandenburgh House until the fair and\r\nfrail Margravine came to live there.\r\n\r\nIts gardens were long famous; and in the time of Dodington were the\r\nscene of revel. Thomas Bentley, the son of Richard Bentley, the\r\ncelebrated critic, had written a play called 'The Wishes;' and during\r\nthe summer of 1761 it was acted at Drury Lane, and met with the especial\r\napprobation of George III., who sent the author, through Lord Bute, a\r\npresent of two hundred guineas as a tribute to the good sentiments of\r\nthe production.\r\n\r\nThis piece, which, in spite of its moral tendency, has died out, whilst\r\nplays of less virtuous character have lived, was rehearsed in the\r\ngardens of Brandenburgh House. Bubb Dodington associated much with those\r\nwho give fame; but he courted amongst them also those who could revenge\r\naffronts by bitter ridicule. Among the actors and literati who were then\r\nsometimes at Brandenburg House were Foote and Churchill; capital boon\r\ncompanions, but, as it proved, dangerous foes.'\r\n\r\nEndowed with imagination; with a mind enriched by classical and\r\nhistorical studies; possessed of a brilliant wit, Bubb Dodington was,\r\nnevertheless, in the sight of some men, ridiculous. Whilst the\r\nrehearsals of 'The Wishes' went on, Foote was noting down all the\r\npeculiarities of the Lord of Brandenburgh House, with a view to bring\r\nthem to account in his play of 'The Patron.' Lord Melcombe was an\r\naristocratic Dombey: stultified by his own self-complacency, he dared to\r\nexhibit his peculiarities before the English Aristophanes. It was an act\r\nof imprudence, for Foote had long before (in 1747) opened the little\r\ntheatre of the Haymarket with a sort of monologue play, 'The Diversions\r\nof the Morning,' in which he convulsed his audience with the perfection\r\nof a mimicry never beheld before, and so wonderful, that even the\r\npersons of his models seemed to stand before the amazed spectators.\r\n\r\nThese entertainments, in which the contriver was at once the author and\r\nperformer, have been admirably revived by Mathews and others; and in\r\nanother line, by the lamented Albert Smith. The Westminster justices,\r\nfurious and alarmed, opposed the daring performance, on which Foote\r\nchanged the name of his piece, and called it 'Mr. Foote giving Tea to\r\nhis Friends,' himself still the sole actor, and changing with\r\nProteus-like celerity from one to the other. Then came his 'Auction of\r\nPictures,' and Sir Thomas de Veil, one of his enemies, the justices, was\r\nintroduced. Orator Henley and Cock the auctioneer figured also; and year\r\nafter year the town was enchanted by that which is most gratifying to a\r\npolite audience, the finished exhibition of faults and follies. One\r\nstern voice was raised in reprobation, that of Samuel Johnson: he, at\r\nall events, had a due horror of buffoons; but even he owned himself\r\nvanquished.\r\n\r\n'The first time I was in Foote's company was at Fitzherbert's. Having no\r\ngood opinion of the fellow, I was resolved not to be pleased: and it is\r\nvery difficult to please a man against his will. I went on eating my\r\ndinner pretty sullenly, affecting not to mind him; but the dog was so\r\nvery comical, that I was obliged to lay down my knife and fork, throw\r\nmyself back in my chair, and fairly laugh it out. Sir, he was\r\nirresistible.' Consoled by Foote's misfortunes and ultimate complicated\r\nmisery for his lessened importance, Bubb Dodington still reigned,\r\nhowever, in the hearts of some learned votaries. Richard Bentley, the\r\ncritic, compared him to Lord Halifax--\r\n\r\n  'That Halifax, my Lord, as you do yet,\r\n  Stood forth the friend of poetry and wit,\r\n  Sought silent merit in the secret cell,\r\n  And Heav'n, nay even man, repaid him well.\r\n\r\nA more remorseless foe, however, than Foote appeared in the person of\r\nCharles Churchill, the wild and unclerical son of a poor curate of\r\nWestminster. Foote laughed Bubb Dodington down, but Churchill\r\nperpetuated the satire; for Churchill was wholly unscrupulous, and his\r\nfaults had been reckless and desperate. Wholly unfit for a clergyman, he\r\nhad taken orders, obtained a curacy in Wales at £30 a year--not being\r\nable to subsist, took to keeping a cider-cellar, became a sort of\r\nbankrupt, and quitting Wales, succeeded to the curacy of his father, who\r\nhad just died. Still famine haunted his home; Churchill took, therefore,\r\nto teaching young ladies to read and write, and conducted himself in the\r\nboarding-school where his duties lay, with wonderful propriety. He had\r\nmarried at seventeen; but even that step had not protected his morals:\r\nhe fell into abject poverty. Lloyd, father of his friend Robert Lloyd,\r\nthen second master of Westminster, made an arrangement with his\r\ncreditors. Young Lloyd had published a poem called 'The Actor;'\r\nChurchill, in imitation, now produced 'The Rosciad,' and Bubb Dodington\r\nwas one whose ridiculous points were salient in those days of\r\npersonality. 'The Rosciad' had a signal success, which completed the\r\nruin of its author: he became a man of the town, forsook the wife of his\r\nyouth, and abandoned the clerical character. There are few sights more\r\ncontemptible than that of a clergyman who has cast off his profession,\r\nor whose profession has cast him off. But Churchill's talents for a time\r\nkept him from utter destitution. Bubb Doddington may have been consoled\r\nby finding that he shared the fate of Dr. Johnson, who had spoken\r\nslightingly of Churchill's works, and who shone forth, therefore, in\r\n'The Ghost,' a later poem, as Dr. Pomposo.\r\n\r\nRichard Cumberland, the dramatist, drew a portrait of Lord Melcombe,\r\nwhich is said to have been taken from the life; but perhaps the most\r\nfaithful delineation of Bubb Dodington's character was furnished by\r\nhimself in his 'Diary;' in which, as it has been well observed, he\r\n'unveiled the nakedness of his mind, and displayed himself as a courtly\r\ncompound of mean compliance and political prostitution.' It may, in\r\npassing, be remarked, that few men figure well in an autobiography; and\r\nthat Cumberland himself, proclaimed by Dr. Johnson to be a 'learned,\r\ningenious, accomplished gentleman,' adding, 'the want of company is an\r\ninconvenience, but Mr. Cumberland is a million:' in spite of this\r\neulogium, Cumberland has betrayed in his own autobiography unbounded\r\nvanity, worldliness, and an undue estimation of his own perishable fame.\r\nAfter all, amusing as personalities must always be, neither the humours\r\nof Foote, the vigorous satire of Churchill, nor the careful limning of\r\nCumberland, whilst they cannot be ranked among talents of the highest\r\norder, imply a sort of social treachery. The delicious little colloquy\r\nbetween Boswell and Johnson places low personal ridicule in its proper\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nBoswell.--'Foote has a great deal of humour.' Johnson.--'Yes, sir.'\r\nBoswell.--'He has a singular talent of exhibiting characters.'\r\nJohnson--'Sir. it is not a talent--it is a vice; it is what others\r\nabstain from. It is not comedy, which exhibits the character of a\r\nspecies--as that of a miser gathered from many misers--it is farce,\r\nwhich exhibits individuals.' Boswell.--'Did not he think of exhibiting\r\nyou, sir?' Johnson.--'Sir, fear restrained him; he knew I would have\r\nbroken his bones. I would have saved him the trouble of cutting off a\r\nleg; I would not have left him a leg to cut off.'\r\n\r\nFew annals exist of the private life of Bubb Dodington, but those few\r\nare discreditable.\r\n\r\nLike most men of his time, and like many men of all times, Dodington was\r\nentangled by an unhappy and perplexing intrigue.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain 'black woman,' as Horace Walpole calls a Mrs.\r\nStrawbridge, whom Bubb Dodington admired. This handsome brunette lived\r\nin a corner house of Saville Row, in Piccadilly, where Dodington visited\r\nher. The result of their intimacy was his giving this lady a bond of ten\r\nthousand pounds to be paid if he married any one else. The real object\r\nof his affections was a Mrs. Behan, with whom he lived seventeen years,\r\nand whom, on the death of Mrs. Strawbridge, he eventually married.\r\n\r\nAmong Bubb Dodington's admirers and disciples was Paul Whitehead, a wild\r\nspecimen of the poet, rake, satirist, dramatist, all in one; and what\r\nwas quite in character, a Templar to boot. Paul--so named from being\r\nborn on that Saint's day--wrote one or two pieces which brought him an\r\nephemeral fame, such as the 'State Dunces,' and the 'Epistle to Dr.\r\nThompson,' 'Manners,' a satire, and the 'Gymnasiad,' a mock heroic poem,\r\nintended to ridicule the passion for boxing, then prevalent. Paul\r\nWhitehead, who died in 1774, was an infamous, but not, in the opinion of\r\nWalpole, a despicable poet, yet Churchill has consigned him to\r\neverlasting infamy as a reprobate, in these lines:--\r\n\r\n  'May I (can worse disgrace on manhood fall?)\r\n  Be born a Whitebread, and baptised a Paul.'\r\n\r\nPaul was not, however, worse than his satirist Churchill; and both of\r\nthese wretched men were members of a society long the theme of horror\r\nand disgust, even after its existence had ceased to be remembered,\r\nexcept by a few old people. This was the 'Hell-fire Club,' held in\r\nappropriate orgies at Medmenham Abbey, Buckinghamshire. The profligate\r\nSir Francis Dashwood, Wilkes, and Churchill, were amongst its most\r\nprominent members.\r\n\r\nWith such associates, and living in a court where nothing but the basest\r\npassions reigned and the lowest arts prevailed, we are inclined to\r\naccord with the descendant of Bubb Dodington, the editor of his 'Diary,'\r\nHenry Penruddocke Wyndham, who declares that all Lord Melcombe's\r\npolitical conduct was 'wholly directed by the base motives of vanity,\r\nselfishness, and avarice.' Lord Melcombe seems to have been a man of the\r\nworld of the very worst _calibre_; sensual, servile, and treacherous;\r\nready, during the lifetime of his patron, Frederick, Prince of Wales, to\r\ngo any lengths against the adverse party of the Pelhams, that Prince's\r\npolitical foes--eager, after the death of Frederick, to court those\r\npowerful men with fawning servility.\r\n\r\nThe famous 'Diary' of Bubb Dodington supplies the information from which\r\nthese conclusions have been drawn. Horace Walpole, who knew Dodington\r\nwell, describes how he read with avidity the 'Diary,' which was\r\npublished in 1784.\r\n\r\n'A nephew of Lord Melcombe's heirs has published that Lord's \"Diary.\"\r\nIndeed it commences in 1749, and I grieve it was not dated twenty years\r\nlater. However, it deals in topics that are twenty times more familiar\r\nand fresh to my memory than any passage that has happened within these\r\nsix months I wish I could convey it to you. Though drawn by his own\r\nhand, and certainly meant to flatter himself, it is a truer portrait\r\nthan any of his hirelings would have given. Never was such a composition\r\nof vanity, versatility, and servility. In short, there is but one\r\nfeature wanting in it, his wit, of which in the whole book there are not\r\nthree sallies.'\r\n\r\nThe editor of this 'Diary' remarks, 'that he will no doubt be considered\r\na very extraordinary editor; the practice of whom has generally been to\r\nprefer flattery to truth, and partiality to justice.' To understand, not\r\nthe flattery which his contemporaries heaped upon Bubb Dodington, but\r\nthe opprobrium with which they loaded his memory--to comprehend not his\r\nmerits but his demerits--it is necessary to take a brief survey of his\r\npolitical life from the commencement. He began life, as we have seen, as\r\na servile adherent of Sir Robert Walpole. A political epistle to the\r\nMinister was the prelude to a temporary alliance only, for in 1737, Bubb\r\nwent over to the adverse party of Leicester House, and espoused the\r\ncause of Frederick, Prince of Wales, against his royal father He was\r\ntherefore dismissed from the Treasury. When Sir Robert fell, Bubb\r\nexpected to rise, but his expectations of preferment were not realized.\r\nHe attacked the new Administration forthwith, and succeeded so far in\r\nbecoming important that he was made Treasurer of the Navy; a post which\r\nhe resigned in 1749, and which he held again in 1755, but which he lost\r\nthe next year. On the accession of George III., he was not ashamed to\r\nappear altogether in a new character, as the friend of Lord Bute; he\r\nwas, therefore, advanced to the peerage by the title of Baron of\r\nMelcombe Regis, in 1761. The honour was enjoyed for one short year only;\r\nand on the 28th of July, 1762, Bubb Dodington expired. Horace Walpole,\r\nin his 'Royal and Noble Authors,' complains that 'Dodington's \"Diary\"\r\nwas mangled, in compliment, before it was imparted to the public.' We\r\ncannot therefore judge of what the 'Diary' was before, as the editor\r\navows that every anecdote was cut out, and all the little gossip so\r\nillustrative of character and manners which would have brightened its\r\ndull pages, fell beneath the power of a merciless pair of scissors. Mr.\r\nPenruddocke Wyndham conceives, however, that he was only doing justice\r\nto society in these suppressions. 'It would,' he says, 'be _no_\r\nentertainment to the reader to be informed who daily dined with his\r\nlordship, or whom he daily met at the table of other people.'\r\n\r\nPosterity thinks differently: a knowledge of a man's associates forms\r\nthe best commentary on his life; and there is much reason to rejoice\r\nthat all biographers are not like Mr. Penruddocke Wyndham. Bubb\r\nDodington, more especially, was a man of society: inferior as a literary\r\nman, contemptible as a politician, it was only at the head of his table\r\nthat he was agreeable and brilliant. He was, in fact, a man who had no\r\ndomestic life; a courtier, like Lord Hervey, but without Lord Hervey's\r\nconsistency. He was, in truth, a type of that era in England: vulgar in\r\naims; dissolute in conduct; ostentatious, vain-glorious--of a low,\r\nephemeral ambition; but at the same time talented, acute, and lavish to\r\nthe lettered. The public is now the patron of the gifted. What writer\r\ncares for individual opinion, except as it tends to sweep up the gross\r\namount of public blame or censure? What publisher will consent to\r\nundertake a work because some lord or lady recommended it to his notice?\r\nThe reviewer is greater in the commonwealth of letters than the man of\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nBut in these days it was otherwise; and they who, in the necessities of\r\nthe times, did what they could to advance the interest of the _belles\r\nlettres_, deserve not to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt is with a feeling of sickness that we open the pages of this great\r\nWit's 'Diary,' and attempt to peruse the sentences in which the most\r\ngrasping selfishness is displayed. We follow him to Leicester House,\r\nthat ancient tenement--(wherefore pulled down, except to erect on its\r\nformer site the narrowest of streets, does not appear): that former home\r\nof the Sydneys had not always been polluted by the dissolute, heartless\r\n_clique_ who composed the court of Frederick, Prince of Wales. Its\r\nchambers had once been traversed by Henry Sydney, by Algernon, his\r\nbrother. It was their _home_--their father, Robert Sydney, Earl of\r\nLeicester, having lived there. The lovely Dorothy Sydney, Waller's\r\nSaccharissa, once, in all purity and grace, had danced in that gallery\r\nwhere the vulgar, brazen Lady Middlesex, and her compliant lord,\r\nafterwards flattered the weakest of princes, Frederick. In old times\r\nLeicester House had stood on Lammas land--land in the spirit of the old\r\ncharities, open to the poor after Lammas-tide; and even 'the Right Hon.\r\nthe Earl of Leicester'--as an old document hath it--was obliged, if _he_\r\nchose to turn out his cows or horses on that appropriated land, to pay a\r\nrent for it to the overseers of St. Martin's parish, then really 'in the\r\nfields.' And here this nobleman not only dwelt in all state himself, but\r\nlet, or lent his house to persons whose memory seems to hallow even\r\nLeicester Fields. Elizabeth of Bohemia, after what was to her indeed\r\n'life's fitful fever,' died at Leicester House. It became then,\r\ntemporarily, the abode of ambassadors. Colbert, in the time of Charles\r\nII., occupied the place; Prince Eugène, in 1712, held his residence\r\nhere; and the rough soldier, famous for all absence of tact--brave,\r\nloyal-hearted, and coarse--lingered at Leicester House in hopes of\r\nobstructing the peace between England and France.\r\n\r\nAll that was good and great fled for ever from Leicester House at the\r\ninstant that George II., when Prince of Wales, was driven by his royal\r\nfather from St. James's, and took up his abode in it until the death of\r\nGeorge I. The once honoured home of the Sydneys henceforth becomes\r\nloathsome in a moral sense. Here William, Duke of Cumberland--the hero,\r\nas court flatterers called him--the butcher, as the poor Jacobite\r\ndesignated him--of Culloden, first saw the light. Peace and\r\nrespectability then dignified the old house for ever. Prince Frederick\r\nwas its next inmate: here the Princess of Wales, the mother of George\r\nIII., had her lying-in, and her royal husband held his public tables;\r\nand at these and in every assembly, as well as in private, one figure is\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nGrace Boyle--for she unworthily bore that great name--was the daughter\r\nand heiress of Richard, Viscount Shannon. She married Lord Middlesex,\r\nbringing him a fortune of thirty thousand pounds. Short, plain, 'very\r\nyellow,' as her contemporaries affirm, with a head full of Greek and\r\nLatin, and devoted to music and painting; it seems strange that\r\nFrederick should have been attracted to one far inferior to his own\r\nprincess both in mind and person. But so it was, for in those days every\r\nman liked his neighbour's wife better than his own. Imitating the\r\nforbearance of her royal mother-in-law, the princess tolerated such of\r\nher husband's mistresses as did not interfere in politics: Lady\r\nMiddlesex was the 'my good Mrs. Howard,' of Leicester House. She was\r\nmade Mistress of the Robes: her favour soon 'grew,' as the shrewd Horace\r\nremarks, 'to be rather more than Platonic.' She lived with the royal\r\npair constantly, and sat up till five o'clock in the morning at their\r\nsuppers; and Lord Middlesex saw and submitted to all that was going on\r\nwith the loyalty and patience of a _Georgian_ courtier. Lady Middlesex\r\nwas a docile politician, and on that account, retained her position\r\nprobably long after she had lost her influence.\r\n\r\nHer name appears constantly in the 'Diary,' out of which everything\r\namusing has been carefully expunged.\r\n\r\n'Lady Middlesex, Lord Bathurst, Mr. Breton, and I, waited on their Royal\r\nHighnesses to Spitalfields, to see the manufacture of silk.' In the\r\nafternoon off went the same party to Norwood Forest, in private coaches,\r\nto see a 'settlement of gypsies.' Then returning, went to find out\r\nBettesworth, the conjuror; but not discovering him, went in search of\r\nthe little Dutchman. Were disappointed in that; but 'concluded,' relates\r\nBubb Dodington, 'the peculiarities of this day by supping with Mrs.\r\nCannon, the princess's _midwife_.'\r\n\r\nAll these elegant modes of passing the time were not only for the sake\r\nof Lady Middlesex, but, it was said, of her friend, Mrs. Granville, one\r\nof the Maids of Honour, daughter of the first Lord Lansdown, the poet.\r\nThis young lady, Eliza Granville, was scarcely pretty: a far, red-haired\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nAll this thoughtless, if not culpable, gallantry was abruptly checked by\r\nthe rude hand of death. During the month of March, Frederick was\r\nattacked with illness, having caught cold. Very little apprehension was\r\nexpressed at first, but, about eleven days after his first attack, he\r\nexpired. Half an hour before his death, he had asked to see some\r\nfriends, and had called for coffee and bread and butter: a fit of\r\ncoughing came on, and he died instantly from suffocation. An abscess,\r\nwhich had been forming in his side, had burst; nevertheless, his two\r\nphysicians, Wilmot and Lee, 'knew nothing of his distemper.' According\r\nto Lord Melcombe, who thus refers to their blunders, 'They declared,\r\nhalf an hour before his death, that his pulse was like a man's in\r\nperfect health. They either would not see or did not know the\r\nconsequences of the black thrush, which appeared in his mouth, and quite\r\ndown in his throat. Their ignorance, or their knowledge of his disorder,\r\nrenders them equally inexcusable for not calling in other assistance.'\r\n\r\nThe consternation in the prince's household was great, not for his life,\r\nbut for the confusion into which politics were thrown by his death.\r\nAfter his relapse, and until just before his death, the princess never\r\nsuffered any English, man or woman, above the degree of valet-de-chambre\r\nto see him; nor did she herself see any one of her household until\r\nabsolutely necessary. After the death of his eldest born, George II.\r\nvented his diabolical jealousy upon the cold remains of one thus cut off\r\nin the prime of life. The funeral was ordered to be on the model of that\r\nof Charles II., but private counter-orders were issued to reduce the\r\nceremonial to the smallest degree of respect that could be paid.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of April, 1751, the body of the prince was entombed in Henry\r\nVII.'s chapel. Except the lords appointed to hold the pall, and attend\r\nthe chief mourner, when the attendants were called over in their ranks,\r\nthere was not a _single_ English lord, not _one_ bishop, and only one\r\nIrish lord (Lord Limerick), and three sons of peers. Sir John Rushout\r\nand Dodington were the only privy counsellors who followed. It rained\r\nheavily, but no covering was provided for the procession. The service\r\nwas performed without organ or anthem. 'Thus,' observes Bubb Dodington,\r\n'ended this sad day.'\r\n\r\nAlthough the prince left a brother and sisters, the Duke of Somerset\r\nacted as chief mourner. The king hailed the event of the prince's death\r\nas a relief, which was to render happy his remaining days; and Bubb\r\nDodington hastened, in a few months, to offer to the Pelhams 'his\r\nfriendship and attachment.' His attendance at court was resumed,\r\nalthough George II. could not endure him; and the old Walpolians,\r\nnick-named the Black-tan, were also averse to him.\r\n\r\nSuch were Bubb Dodington's _actions_. His expressions, on occasion of\r\nthe prince's death, were in a very different tone.\r\n\r\n'We have lost,' he wrote to Sir Horace Mann, 'the delight and ornament\r\nof the age he lived in,--the expectations of the public: in this light I\r\nhave lost more than any subject in England; but this is light,--public\r\nadvantages confined to myself do not, ought not, to weigh with me. But\r\nwe have lost the refuge of private distress--the balm of the afflicted\r\nheart the shelter of the miserable against the fury of private\r\nadversity; the arts, the graces, the anguish, the misfortunes of\r\nsociety, have lost their patron and their remedy.\r\n\r\n'I have lost my companion--my protector--the friend that loved me, that\r\ncondescended to hear, to communicate, to share in all the pleasures and\r\npains of the human heart: where the social affections and emotions of\r\nthe mind only presided without regard to the infinite disproportion of\r\nmy rank and condition. This is a wound that cannot, ought not to heal.\r\nIf I pretended to fortitude here, I should be infamous--a monster of\r\ningratitude--and unworthy of all consolation, if I was not\r\ninconsolable.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' writes the shrewd Horace Walpole, addressing Sir Horace\r\nMann, 'for the transcript from _Bulb de Tristibus_. I will keep your\r\nsecret, though I am persuaded that a man who had composed such a funeral\r\noration on his master had himself fully intended that its flowers should\r\nnot bloom and wither in obscurity.'\r\n\r\nWell might George II., seeing him go to court say: 'I see Dodington here\r\nsometimes, what does he come for?'\r\n\r\nIt was, however, clearly seen what he went for, when, in 1753, two years\r\nafter the death of his 'benefactor,' Dodington humbly offered His\r\nMajesty his services in the house, and 'five members,' for the rest of\r\nhis life, if His Majesty would give Mr. Pelham leave to employ him for\r\nHis Majesty's service. Nevertheless he continued to advise with the\r\nPrincess of Wales, and to drop into her house as if it had been a\r\nsister's house--sitting on a stool near the fireside, and listening to\r\nher accounts of her children.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these intrigues for favour on the part of Dodington, Mr.\r\nPelham died, and was succeeded by his brother, the Duke of Newcastle,\r\nthe issue of whose administration is well known.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 death again befriended the now veteran wit, beau and politician.\r\nGeorge II. died; and the intimacy which Dodington had always taken care\r\nto preserve between himself and the Princess of Wales, ended\r\nadvantageously for him; and he instantly, in spite of all his former\r\nprofessions to Pelham, joined hand and heart with that minister, from\r\nwhom he obtained a peerage. This, as we have seen, was not long enjoyed.\r\nLord Melcombe, as this able, intriguing man was now styled, died on the\r\n28th of July, 1762; and with him terminated the short-lived distinction\r\nfor which he had sacrificed even a decent pretext of principle and\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\nSo general has been the contempt felt for his character, that it seems\r\nalmost needless to assert that Bubb Dodington was eminently to be\r\ndespised. Nothing much more severe can be said of him than the remarks\r\nof Horace Walpole--upon his 'Diary;' in which he observes that Dodington\r\nrecords little but what is to his own disgrace; as if he thought that\r\nthe world would forgive his inconsistencies as readily as he forgave\r\nhimself. 'Had he adopted,' Horace well observes, 'the French title\r\n\"_Confessions_,\" it would have seemed to imply some kind of penitence.'\r\n\r\nBut vain-glory engrossed him: 'He was determined to raise an altar to\r\nhimself, and for want of burnt offerings, lighted the pyre, like a great\r\nauthor (Rousseau), with his own character.'\r\n\r\nIt was said by the same acute observer, both of Lord Hervey and of Bubb\r\nDodington, that they were the only two persons he ever knew that were\r\nalways aiming at wit and never finding it.' And here, it seems, most\r\nthat can be testified in praise of a heartless, clever man, must be\r\nsummed up.\r\n\r\nLord Melcombe's property, with the exception of a few legacies, devolved\r\nupon his cousin Thomas Wyndham, of Hammersmith, by whom his Lordship's\r\npapers, letters, and poems, were bequeathed to Henry Penruddocke\r\nWyndham, with an injunction, that only such as 'might do honour to his\r\nmemory should be made public.'\r\n\r\nAfter this, in addition to the true saying, defend us from our friends\r\none may exclaim, 'defend us from our executors and editors.'",
