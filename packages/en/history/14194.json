AND THE DAYS OF JULY.\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII. in 1815 returned to his throne, borne on the shoulders\r\nof foreign soldiers, after the fight at Waterloo. The allied armies\r\nhad a second time entered France to make her pass under the saws\r\nand harrows of humiliation. Paris was gay, for money was spent\r\nfreely by the invading strangers. Sacrifices on the altar of the\r\nEmperor were over; enthusiasm for the extension of the great ideas\r\nof the Revolution had passed away; a new generation had been born\r\nwhich cared more for material prosperity than for such ideas; the\r\nfoundation of many fortunes had been laid; mothers who dreaded\r\nthe conscription, and men weary of war and politics, drew a long\r\nbreath, and did not regret the loss of that which had animated\r\na preceding generation, in a view of a peace which was to bring\r\nwealth, comfort, and tranquillity into their own homes.\r\n\r\nThe _bourgeoisie_ of France trusted that it had seen the last of the\r\nGreat Revolution. It stood between the working-classes, who had no\r\nvoice in the politics of the Restoration, and the old nobility,--men\r\nwho had returned to France full of exalted expectations. The king\r\nhad to place himself on one side or the other. He might have been\r\nthe true Bourbon and headed the party of the returned _émigrés_,--in\r\nwhich case his crown would not have stayed long upon his head; or\r\nhe might have made himself king of the _bourgeoisie_, opposed to\r\nrevolution, Napoleonism, or disturbances of any kind,--the party,\r\nin short, of the Restoration of Peace: a peace that might outlast\r\nhis time; _et après moi le déluge!_\r\n\r\nBut animals which show neither teeth nor claws are seldom left in\r\npeace, and Louis XVIII.'s reign--from 1814 to 1824--was full of\r\nconspiracies. The royalty of the Restoration was only an ornament\r\ntacked on to France. The Bourbon dynasty was a necessary evil, even\r\nin the eyes of its supporters. \"The Bourbons,\" said Chateaubriand,\r\n\"are the foam on the revolutionary wave that has brought them back\r\nto power;\" whilst every one knows Talleyrand's famous saying \"that\r\nafter five and twenty years of exile they had nothing remembered\r\nand nothing forgot.\" Of course the old nobility, who flocked back to\r\nFrance in the train of the allied armies, expected the restoration\r\nof their estates. The king had got his own again,--why should not\r\nthey get back theirs? And they imagined that France, which had\r\nbeen overswept by successive waves of revolution, could go back\r\nto what she had been under the old régime. This was impossible.\r\nThe returned exiles had to submit to the confiscation of their\r\nestates, and receive in return all offices and employments in the\r\ngift of the Government. The army which had conquered in a hundred\r\nbattles, with its marshals, generals, and _vieux moustaches_, was\r\nnot pleased to have young officers, chosen from the nobility, receive\r\ncommissions and be charged with important commands. On the other\r\nhand, the Holy Alliance expected that the king of France would\r\njoin the despotic sovereigns of Russia, Austria, and Prussia in\r\ntheir crusade against liberal ideas in other countries. Against\r\nthese difficulties, and many more, Louis XVIII. had to contend.\r\nHe was an infirm man, physically incapable of exertion,--a man\r\nwho only wanted to be let alone, and to avoid by every means in\r\nhis power the calamity of being again sent into exile.\r\n\r\nHe placed himself on the side of the stronger party,--he took part\r\nwith the _bourgeoisie_. His aim, as he himself said, was to _ménager_\r\nhis throne. He began his reign by having Fouché and Talleyrand, men\r\nof the Revolution and the Empire, deep in his councils, though he\r\ndisliked both of them. Early in his reign occurred what was called\r\nthe White Terror, in the southern provinces, where the adherents of\r\nthe white flag repeated on a small scale the barbarities of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThe king was forced to put himself in opposition to the old nobles\r\nwho had adhered to him in his exile. They bitterly resented his\r\ndefection. They used to toast him as _le roi-quand-même_, \"the\r\nking in spite of everything.\" His own family held all the Bourbon\r\ntraditions, and were opposed to him. To them everything below the\r\nrank of a noble with sixteen quarterings was _la canaille_.\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII.'s favorite minister was M. Decazes, a man who studied\r\nthe interests of the _bourgeoisie_; and the royal family at last made\r\nthe sovereign so uncomfortable by their disapproval of his policy\r\nthat he sought repose in the society and intimacy (the connection is\r\nsaid to have been nothing more) of a Madame de Cayla, with whom\r\nhe spent most of his leisure time.\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution, Louis XVIII. had been known sometimes as\r\nthe Comte de Provence, and sometimes as Monsieur. Though physically\r\nan inert man, he was by no means intellectually stupid, for he\r\ncould say very brilliant things from time to time, and was very\r\nproud of them; but he was wholly unfit to be at the helm of the\r\nship of state in an unquiet sea.\r\n\r\nHe had passed the years of his exile in various European countries,\r\nbut the principal part of his time had been spent at Hartwell,\r\nabout sixty miles from London, where he formed a little court and\r\nlived a life of royalty in miniature. Charles Greville, when a\r\nvery young man, visited Hartwell with his relative, the Duke of\r\nBeaufort, shortly before the Restoration. He describes the king's\r\ncabinet as being like a ship's cabin, the walls hung with portraits\r\nof Louis XVI., Marie Antoinette, Madame Elisabeth, and the dauphin.\r\nLouis himself had a singular habit of swinging his body backward\r\nand forward when talking, \"which exactly resembled the heavings\r\nof a ship at sea.\" \"We were a very short time at table,\" Greville\r\nadds; \"the meal was a very plain one, and the ladies and gentlemen\r\nall got up together. Each lady folded up her napkin, tied it round\r\nwith a bit of ribbon, and carried it away with her. After dinner we\r\nreturned for coffee and conversation to the drawing-room. Whenever\r\nthe king came in or went out of the room, Madame d'Angoulême made him\r\na low courtesy, which he returned by bowing and kissing her hand.\r\nThis little ceremony never failed to take place.\" They finished\r\nthe evening with whist, \"his Majesty settling the points of the\r\ngame at a quarter of a shilling.\" \"We saw the whole place,\" adds\r\nGreville, \"before we came away; they had certainly shown great\r\ningenuity in contriving to lodge so great a number of people in\r\nand around the house. It was like a small rising colony.\"\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII. was childless. His brother Charles and himself had\r\nmarried sisters, princesses of the house of Savoy. These ladies were\r\namiable nonentities, and died during the exile of their husbands; but\r\nCharles's wife had left him two sons,--Louis Antoine, known as the\r\nDuc d'Angoulême, and Charles Ferdinand, known as the Duc de Berri.\r\nThe Duc d'Angoulême had married his cousin Marie Thérèse, daughter\r\nof Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette. Their union was childless. The\r\nDuc de Berri had married Marie Caroline, a princess of Naples.\r\nShe had two children,--Louise, who when she grew up became Duchess\r\nof Parma; and Henri, called variously the Duc de Bordeaux, Henri\r\nV., and the Comte de Chambord.\r\n\r\nAll Louis XVIII.'s efforts during his ten years' reign were directed\r\nto keeping things as quiet as he could during his lifetime. He\r\ngreatly disapproved of the policy of the Holy Alliance in forcing\r\nhim to make war on Spain in order to put down the Constitutionalists\r\nunder Riego and Mina. The expedition for that purpose was commanded\r\nby the Duc d'Angoulême, who accomplished his mission, but with\r\nlittle glory or applause except from flatterers. The chief military\r\nincident of the campaign was the capture by the French of the forts\r\nof Trocadéro, which commanded the entrance to Cadiz harbor.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Angoulême, that _filia dolorosa_ left to languish\r\nalone in the Temple after her parents and her aunt were guillotined,\r\nhad been exchanged with Austria for Lafayette by Bonaparte in the\r\ntreaty of Campo-Formio; but her soul had been crushed within her\r\nby her sorrows. Deeply pious, she forgave the enemies of her house,\r\nshe never uttered a word against the Revolution; but the sight\r\nof her pale, set, sad face was a mute reproach to Frenchmen. She\r\ncould forgive, but she could not be gracious. At the Tuileries,\r\na place full of graceful memories of the Empress Josephine, she\r\npresided as a _dévote_ and a dowdy. She could not have been expected\r\nto be other than she was, but the nation that had made her so,\r\nbore a grudge against her. There was nothing French about her. No\r\nsympathies existed between her and the generation that had grown\r\nup in France during the nineteenth century. Both she and her husband\r\nwere stiff, cold, ultra-aristocrats. In intelligence she was greatly\r\nthe duke's superior, as she was also in person, he being short,\r\nfat, red-faced, with very thin legs.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Berri was much more popular. He was a Frenchman in character.\r\nHis faults were French. He was pleasure-seeking, pleasure-loving,\r\nand he married a young and pretty wife to whom he was far from\r\nfaithful, and who was as fond of pleasure as himself.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Berri was assassinated by a man named Louvel, Feb. 13,\r\n1820, as he was handing his wife into her carriage at the door of\r\nthe French Opera House. They carried him back into the theatre,\r\nand there, in a side room, with the music of the opera going on\r\nupon the stage, the plaudits of the audience ringing in his ears,\r\nand ballet-girls flitting in and out in their stage dresses, the\r\nheir of France gave up his life, with kindly words upon his dying\r\nlips, reminding us of Charles II. on his deathbed.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, Louis XVIII.'s reign was not without plots and\r\nconspiracies. One of those in 1823 was got up by the Carbonari.\r\nLafayette was implicated in it. It was betrayed, however, the night\r\nbefore it was to have been put in execution, and such of its leaders\r\nas could be arrested were guillotined. Lafayette was saved by the\r\nfact that the day fixed upon for action was the anniversary of his\r\nwife's death,--a day he always spent in her chamber in seclusion.\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to say who were the Carbonari. \"Carbone\" is\r\nItalian for charcoal. The Carbonari were charcoal-burners. The\r\nconspirators took their name because charcoal-burners lived in\r\nsolitary places, and were disguised by the coal-dust that blackened\r\ntheir faces. It was a secret society which extended throughout\r\nFrance, Italy, and almost all Europe. It was joined by all classes.\r\nIts members, under pain of death, were forced to obey the orders\r\nof the society. The deliverance of Italy from the Austrians became\r\neventually the prime object of the institution.\r\n\r\nLafayette, during his visit to America in 1824, expressed himself\r\nfreely about the Bourbons. \"France cannot be happy under their\r\nrule,\" he said;[1] \"and we must send them adrift. It would have been\r\ndone before now but for the hesitation of Laffitte. Two regiments\r\nof guards, when ordered to Spain under the Duc d'Angoulême, halted\r\nat Toulouse, and began to show symptoms of mutiny. The matter was\r\nquieted, however, and the affair kept as still as possible. But\r\nall was ready. I knew of the whole affair. All that was wanted\r\nto make a successful revolution at that time was money. I went\r\nto Laffitte; but he was full of doubts, and dilly-dallied with\r\nthe matter. Then I offered to do it without his help. Said I: 'On\r\nthe first interview that you and I have without witnesses, put\r\na million of francs, in bank-notes, on the mantelpiece, which I\r\nwill pocket unseen by you. Then leave the rest to me.' Laffitte\r\nstill fought shy of it, hesitated, deliberated, and at last decided\r\nthat he would have nothing at all to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Vincent Nolte, Fifty Years in Two Hemispheres.]\r\n\r\nHere the gentleman to whom Lafayette was speaking exclaimed, \"If\r\nany one had told me this but yourself, General, I would not have\r\nbelieved it.\"\r\n\r\nLafayette merely answered, \"It was really so,\"--a proof, thinks\r\nthe narrator, how fiercely the fire of revolution still burned\r\nin the old man's soul.\r\n\r\nThe last months of Louis XVIII.'s life were embittered by changes\r\nof ministry from semi-liberal to ultra-royalist, and by attempts\r\nof the officers of the Crown to prosecute the newspapers for\r\nfree-speaking. He died, after a few days of illness and extreme\r\nsuffering, Sept. 15, 1824, and was succeeded by the Comte d'Artois,\r\nhis brother, as Charles X. This was the third time three brothers\r\nhad succeeded each other on the French throne.\r\n\r\nCharles X. was another James II., with cold, harsh, narrow ideas\r\nof religion, though religion had not influenced his early life\r\nin matters of morality. He was, as I have said, a widower, with\r\none remaining son, the Duc d'Angoulême, and a little grandson, the\r\nson of the Duc de Berri. His two daughters-in-law, the Duchesse\r\nd'Angoulême and the Duchesse de Berri, were as unlike each other\r\nas two women could be,--the one being an unattractive saint, the\r\nother a fascinating sinner.\r\n\r\nCharles X. was not like his brother,--distracted between two policies\r\nand two opinions. He was an ultra-royalist. He believed that to the\r\nvictors belong the spoils; and as Bourbonism had triumphed, he wanted\r\nto stamp out every remnant of the Revolution. Constitutionalism,\r\nthe leading idea of the day, was hateful to him. He is said to have\r\nremarked, \"I had rather earn my bread than be a king of England!\"\r\nHe probably held the same ideas concerning royal prerogative as\r\nthose of his cousin, the king of Naples, expressed in a letter\r\nfound after the sack of the Tuileries in 1848.\r\n\r\n\"Liberty is fatal to the house of Bourbon; and as regards myself,\r\nI am resolved to avoid, at any price, the fate of Louis XVI. My\r\npeople obey force, and bend their necks; but woe to me if they\r\nshould ever raise them under the impulse of those dreams which sound\r\nso fine in the sermons of philosophers, and which it is impossible\r\nto put in practice. With God's blessing, I will give prosperity\r\nto my people, and a government as honest as they have a right to\r\nexpect; but I will be a king,--and that _always!_\"\r\n\r\nCharles X. was on the throne six years. He was a fine-looking man\r\nand a splendid horseman,--which at first pleased the Parisians,\r\nwho had been disgusted with the unwieldiness and lack of royal\r\npresence in Louis XVIII. His first act was a concession they little\r\nexpected, and one calculated to render him popular. He abridged\r\nthe powers of the censors of the Press. His minister at this time\r\nwas M. de Villèle, a man of whom it has been said that he had a\r\ngenius for trifles; but M. de Villèle having been defeated on some\r\nmeasures that he brought before the Chamber of Deputies, Charles\r\nX. was glad to remove him, and to appoint as his prime minister\r\nhis favorite, the Prince de Polignac. Charles Greville, who was\r\nin Paris at the time of this appointment, writes: \"Nothing can\r\nexceed the violence of feeling that prevails. The king does nothing\r\nbut cry; Polignac is said to have the fatal obstinacy of a martyr,\r\nthe worst courage of the _ruat coelum_ sort.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _CHARLES X._]\r\n\r\nSix months later Greville writes: \"Nobody has an idea how things\r\nwill turn out, or what are Polignac's intentions or his resources.\"\r\nHe appeared calm and well satisfied, saying to those who claimed the\r\nright to question him, that all would be well, though all France\r\nand a clear majority in the Chambers were against him. \"I am told,\"\r\nsays Charles Greville, \"that there is no revolutionary spirit abroad,\r\nbut a strong determination to provide for the stability of existing\r\ninstitutions, and disgust at the obstinacy and the pretensions of\r\nthe king. It seems also that a desire to substitute the Orleans\r\nfor the reigning branch is becoming very general. It is said that\r\nPolignac is wholly ignorant of France, and will not listen to the\r\nopinions of those who could enlighten him. It is supposed that\r\nCharles X. is determined to push matters to extremity; to try the\r\nChambers, and if his ministers are beaten, to dissolve the House\r\nand to govern _par ordonnances du roi_.\" This prophecy, written\r\nin March, 1830, foreshadowed exactly what happened in July of the\r\nsame year, when, as an outspoken English Tory told Henry Crabb\r\nRobinson, in a reading-room at Florence: \"The king of France has\r\nsent the deputies about their business, has abolished the d----d\r\nConstitution and the liberty of the Press, and proclaimed his own\r\npower as absolute king.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what will the end be?\" cried Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"It will end,\" said a Frenchman who was present, \"in driving the\r\nBourbons out of France!\"\r\n\r\nDuring the last months of Charles X.'s reign France made an expedition\r\nagainst the Dey of Algiers, which was the first step in the conquest\r\nof Algeria. The immediate object of the expedition, however, was to\r\ndraw off the attention of a disaffected nation from local politics.\r\nAn army of 57,000 soldiers, 103 ships of war, and many transports,\r\nwas despatched to the coast of Barbary. The expedition was not\r\nvery glorious, but it was successful. Te Deums were sung in Paris,\r\nthe general in command was made a marshal, and his naval colleague\r\na peer.\r\n\r\nThe royalists of France were at this period divided into two parties;\r\nthe party of the king and Polignac, who were governed by the Jesuits,\r\nlooked for support to the clergy of France. The other party looked\r\nto the army. Yet the most religious men in the country--men like M.\r\nde la Ferronays, for example--condemned and regretted the obstinacy\r\nof the king.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe, the Duke of Orleans, on whom all eyes were fixed,\r\nwas the son of that infamous Duke of Orleans who in the Revolution\r\nproclaimed himself a republican, took the name of Philippe Égalité,\r\nand voted for the execution of the king, drawing down upon himself\r\nthe rebuke of the next Jacobin whose turn it was to vote in the\r\nconvention, who exclaimed: \"I was going to vote Yes, but I vote\r\nNo, that I may not tread in the steps of the man who has voted\r\nbefore me.\"\r\n\r\nÉgalité was in the end a victim. He perished, after suffering great\r\npoverty, leaving three sons and a daughter. The sons were Louis\r\nPhilippe, who became Duke of Orleans, the Comte de Beaujolais, and\r\nthe Duc de Montpensier. One of these had shared the imprisonment\r\nof his father, and narrowly escaped the guillotine.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe had solicited from the Republic permission to serve\r\nunder Dumouriez in his celebrated campaign in the Low Countries.\r\nHe fought with distinguished bravery at Valmy and Jemappes as\r\nDumouriez's aide-de-camp; but when that general was forced to desert\r\nhis army and escape for his life, Louis Philippe made his escape\r\ntoo. He went into Switzerland, and there taught mathematics in a\r\nschool. Thence he came to America, travelled through the United\r\nStates, and resided for some time at Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 he went out to the Mediterranean in an English man-of-war\r\nin charge of his sick brother, the Comte de Beaujolais. The same\r\nvessel carried Sir John Moore out to his command, and landed him at\r\nLisbon. Louis Philippe could not have had a very pleasant voyage,\r\nfor the English admiral, on board whose ship he was a passenger,\r\ncame up one day in a rage upon the quarter-deck, and declared aloud,\r\nin the hearing of his officers, that the Duke of Orleans was such a\r\nd----d republican he could not sit at the same table with him.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: My father was present, and often told the story]\r\n\r\nThere used to be stories floating about Paris concerning Louis\r\nPhilippe's birth and parentage,--stories, however, not to be believed,\r\nand which broke down upon investigation. These made him out to\r\nbe the son of an Italian jailer, exchanged for a little girl who\r\nhad been born to the Duke of Orleans and his wife at a time when\r\nit was a great object with them to have a son. The little girl\r\ngrew up in the jailer Chiappini's house under the name of Maria\r\nStella Petronilla. There is little doubt that she was a changeling,\r\nbut the link is imperfect which would connect her with the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Orleans. She was ill-treated by the jailer's wife,\r\nbut was very beautiful. Lord Newburgh, an English nobleman, saw\r\nher and married her. Her son succeeded his father as a peer of\r\nEngland. After Lord Newburgh's death his widow married a Russian\r\nnobleman. Chiappini on his death-bed confessed to this lady all he\r\nknew about her origin, and she persuaded herself that her father\r\nmust have been the Duke of Orleans. She took up her residence in the\r\nRue Rivoli, overlooking the gardens of the Tuileries, and received\r\nsome small pension from the benevolent royal family of France. She\r\ndied in 1845.\r\n\r\nBut whoever the mother of Louis Philippe may have been, she whom\r\nhe and Madame Adélaide looked up to and loved as though she had\r\nbeen their second mother, was Madame de Genlis. In her company\r\nLouis Philippe witnessed, with boyish exultation, the destruction\r\nof the Bastile. To her he wrote after the great day when in the\r\nChamp de Mars the new Constitution was sworn to both by king and\r\npeople: \"Oh, my mother! there are but two things that I supremely\r\nlove,--the new constitution and you!\"\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day, 1809, he married at Palermo the Princesse Marie\r\nAmélie, niece to Marie Antoinette, and aunt to the future Duchesse\r\nde Berri.\r\n\r\nNo breath of scandal ever disturbed the matrimonal happiness of\r\nLouis Philippe and Marie Amélie. They had a noble family of five\r\nsons and three daughters, all distinguished by their ability and\r\nvirtues. I shall have to tell hereafter how devotion to the interests\r\nof his family was one cause of Louis Philippe's overthrow.\r\n\r\nIn 1814, when Napoleon abdicated at Fontainebleau; Louis Philippe\r\nleft Palermo, attended only by one servant, and made his way to\r\nParis and the home of his family, the Palais Royal. He hurried\r\ninto the house, and in spite of the opposition of the concierge,\r\nwho took him for a madman, he rushed to the staircase; but before\r\nhe ascended it he fell upon his knees, and bursting into tears,\r\nkissed the first step before him.\r\n\r\nThis was probably the most French-like thing in Louis Philippe's\r\ncareer. He was far more like an Englishman than a Frenchman. Had\r\nhe been an English prince, his faults would have seemed to his\r\npeople like virtues.\r\n\r\nOf course the son of Égalité could be no favorite with the elder\r\nBourbons; but he soon became the hope of the middle classes, and\r\nwas very intimate with Laffitte the banker, and with Lafayette,\r\nwho, as we have seen, were both implicated in conspiracies seven\r\nyears before the Revolution of 1830. He was for many years not\r\nrich, but he and the ladies of his house were very charitable.\r\nMadame Adélaïde, speaking one day to a friend[1] of the reports\r\nthat were circulated concerning her brother's parsimony, said,--\r\n\r\n\"People ask what he does with his money. To satisfy them it would\r\nbe necessary to publish the names of honorable friends of liberty\r\nwho, in consequence of misfortunes, have solicited and obtained\r\nfrom him sums of twenty, thirty, forty, and even three hundred\r\nthousand francs. They forget all the extraordinary expenses my\r\nbrother has had to meet, all the demands he has to comply with.\r\nOut of his income he has furnished the Palais Royal, improved the\r\n_apanages_ of the House of Orleans; and yet sooner or later all\r\nthis property will revert to the nation. When we returned to France\r\nour inheritance was so encumbered that my brother was advised to\r\ndecline administering on the estate; but to that neither he nor\r\nI would consent. For all these things people make no allowances.\r\nTruly, we know not how to act to inspire the confidence which our\r\nopinions and our consciences tell us we fully deserve.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: M. Appert, chaplain to Queen Marie Amélie.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _LOUIS PHILLIPPE_. (_Duke of Orleans_.)]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary in a sketch so brief to go minutely into politics.\r\nPrince Polignac and the king dissolved the Chambers, having found the\r\ndeputies unwilling to approve their acts, and a few days afterwards\r\nthe king published his own will and pleasure in what were called\r\n_Les Ordonnances du Roi_. One of these restricted the liberty of\r\nthe Press, and was directed against journalism; another provider\r\nnew rules, by which the ministry might secure a more subservient\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, these _ordonnances_ even in foreign countries\r\nspread dismay. The revolution that ensued was the revolution of\r\nthe great bankers and the business men,--the _haute bourgeoisie_.\r\nIn general, revolutions are opposed by the moneyed classes; but\r\nthis was a revolution effected by them to save themselves and their\r\nproperty from such an outbreak as came forty years later, which\r\nwe call the Commune. The working-classes had little to do with\r\nthe Revolution of 1830, except, indeed, to fight for it, nor had\r\nthey much to do with the Revolution of 1848. It was the moneyed\r\nmen of France who saw that the resuscitated principles of the old\r\nrégime had been stretched to their very uttermost all over Europe,\r\nand that if they did not check them by a well-conducted revolution,\r\nworse would be sure to come.\r\n\r\nOn July 26, 1830, the _ordonnances_ appeared. The working-classes\r\nseemed to hear of them without emotion; but their effect on all those\r\nwho had any stake in the prosperity of the country was very great.\r\nBy nightfall the agitation had spread in Paris to all classes. King\r\nCharles X. was at Saint-Cloud, apparently apprehending no popular\r\noutbreak. No military preparations in case of disturbances had been\r\nmade, though on the morning of the 26th the Duc d'Angoulême sent\r\nword to Marshal Marmont to take command of the troops in Paris,\r\n\"as there might be some windows broken during the day.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning trouble was begun by the journeymen printers,\r\nwho, as the newspapers on which they worked had been prohibited,\r\nwere sent home from their printing-offices. Before long they were\r\njoined by others, notably by the cadets from the Polytechnic School.\r\nCasimir Perrier and Laffitte were considered chiefs of the revolution.\r\nThe cry was everywhere \"Vive la Charte,\"--a compendium that had\r\nbeen drawn up of the franchises and privileges of Frenchmen. M.\r\nThiers, then young, counselled moderation in the emergency.\r\n\r\nOn July 28 the tricolored flag was again unfurled in Paris,--those\r\ncolors dear to Frenchmen, who had long hated the white flag, which\r\nrepresented in their eyes despotism and the rule of the Bourbons!\r\nThe National Guard (or militia) was called out, and the populace\r\nbegan erecting barricades.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how rapidly in an emergency a barricade can be\r\nformed. A carriage or two is overturned, furniture is brought out\r\nfrom neighboring houses, a large tree, if available, is cut down,\r\nand the whole is strengthened with paving-stones. By night all\r\nParis had become a field of battle.\r\n\r\nIn vain Marshal Marmont had sent courier after courier to Saint-Cloud,\r\nimploring the king and his ministers to do something that might allay\r\nthe fury of the people. No answer was returned. The marshal went\r\nhimself at last, and the king, after listening to his representation\r\nof the state of Paris, said calmly: \"Then it is really a revolt?\"\r\n\"No, sire,\" replied Marmont; \"it is not a revolt, but a revolution.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the idea of ruin broke upon the royal household, everything\r\nat Saint-Cloud became confusion and despair. The Duchesse de Berri\r\nwanted to take her son, the Duc de Bordeaux, into Paris, hoping\r\nthat the people would rally round a woman and the young heir to\r\nthe throne. Some implored the king to treat with the insurgents;\r\nsome to put himself at the head of his troops; some to sacrifice\r\nthe _ordonnances_ and the most obnoxious of his ministers.\r\n\r\nThe Parisian mob by this time had its blood up. It fought with any\r\nweapons that came to hand. Muskets were loaded with type seized in\r\nthe printing-offices. At the Hôtel-de-Ville, Laffitte, Lafayette,\r\nand other leading men opposed to the policy of Charles X. were\r\nassembled in council.\r\n\r\nThe troops at first fought in their king's cause bravely, but without\r\nenthusiasm. Subsequently the Duke of Wellington was asked if he\r\ncould not have suppressed the revolution with the garrison of Paris,\r\nwhich was twenty thousand men. He answered, \"Easily; but then they\r\nmust have been fighting for a cause they had at heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe fight continued all the night of the 28th, bloody and furious.\r\nBy morning the soldiers were short of ammunition. As usual, the\r\nSwiss Guard was stanch, but the French soldiers faltered. About\r\nmidday of the 29th two regiments went over to the insurgents.\r\n\r\nTwo peers were at this juncture sent to negotiate with the royal\r\nfamily. The ministers, with Polignac at their head, went out also\r\nto Saint-Cloud. \"Sire,\" said one of the negotiators, \"if in an\r\nhour the _ordonnances_ are not rescinded, there will be neither\r\nking nor kingdom.\" \"Could you not offer me two hours?\" said the\r\nking, sarcastically, as he turned to leave the chamber. The envoy,\r\nan old man, fell on his knees and seized the skirt of the king's\r\ncoat. \"Think of the dauphine!\" he cried, imploringly. The king\r\nseemed moved, but made no answer.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, Marmont, whose heart was with the insurgents, endeavored\r\nnevertheless to do his duty; but his troops deserted him. On learning\r\nthis, Talleyrand walked up to his clock, saying solemnly: \"Take\r\nnotice that on July 29, 1830, at five minutes past twelve o'clock,\r\nthe elder branch of the Bourbons ceased to reign.\"\r\n\r\nThe Louvre was taken, and the Tuileries. There was no general pillage,\r\nthe insurgents contenting themselves with breaking the statues of\r\nkings and other signs of royalty.\r\n\r\nOne of the most obnoxious persons in Paris was the archbishop. The\r\nmob fought to the music of \"Ça ira.\" with new words:--\r\n\r\n  \"C'est l'Archevêque de Paris\r\n  Qui est Jésuite comme Charles Dix.\r\n  Dansons la Carmagnole; dansons la Carmagnole,\r\n    Et ça ira!\"\r\n\r\nThere were deeds of heroism, deeds of self-sacrifice. deeds of\r\nloyalty, deeds of cruelty, and deeds of mercy, as there always\r\nare in Paris in times of revolution. By nightfall on the 29th the\r\nfighting was over. It only remained to be seen what would be done\r\nwith the victory. The evening before, Laffitte had sent a messenger\r\nto Louis Philippe, then residing two miles from Paris, at his Château\r\nde Neuilly, warning him to hold himself in readiness for anything\r\nthat might occur. Lafayette had been made governor of Paris, and\r\nthus held in his hand the destinies of France. Under him served\r\nan improvised municipal commune.\r\n\r\nBy this time Prince Polignac had been dismissed, and the Duc de\r\nMontemart had been summoned by the king to form a more liberal\r\nministry. Everything was in confusion in the palace. The weary\r\ntroops, who had marched to the defence of Saint-Cloud when the\r\nstruggle in Paris became hopeless, were scattered about the park\r\nunfed and uncared-for.\r\n\r\nThe king, having at last made up his mind to yield, sent the envoys\r\nwho had been despatched to him, back to Paris, saying: \"Go, gentlemen,\r\ngo; tell the Parisians that the king revokes the _ordonnances_.\r\nBut I declare to you that I believe this step will be fatal to\r\nthe interests of France and of the monarchy.\"\r\n\r\nThe envoys on reaching Paris were met by the words: \"Too late!\r\nThe throne of Charles X. has already passed from him in blood.\"\r\n\r\nThe king, however, confident that after such concessions the revolt\r\nwas at an end, played whist during the evening, while the Duc\r\nd'Angoulême sat looking over a book of geography. At midnight,\r\nhowever, both were awakened to hear the news from Paris, and then\r\nCharles X.'s confidence gave way. He summoned his new prime minister\r\nand sent him on a mission to the capital. The Duc d'Angoulême,\r\nhowever, who was opposed to any compromise with rebels, would not\r\nsuffer the minister to pass his outposts. The Duc de Montemart,\r\nanxious to execute his mission, walked all night round the outskirts\r\nof Paris, and entered it at last on the side opposite to Saint-Cloud.\r\nThe city lay in the profound silence of the hour before day.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Louis Blanc, Dix Ans. Histoire de trente heures, 1830.]\r\n\r\nThe question of who should succeed Charles X. had already been\r\ndebated in Laffitte's chamber. Laffitte declared himself for Louis\r\nPhilippe, the Duke of Orleans. Some were for the son of Napoleon.\r\nMany were for the Duc de Bordeaux, with Louis Philippe during his\r\nminority as lieutenant-general of the kingdom. \"That might have been\r\nyesterday,\" said M. Laffitte, \"if the Duchesse de Berri, separating\r\nher son's cause from that of his grandfather, had presented herself in\r\nParis, holding Henri V. in one hand, and in the other the tricolor.\"\r\n\"The tricolor!\" exclaimed the others; \"why, they look upon the\r\ntricolor as the symbol of all crimes!\" \"Then what can be done for\r\nthem?\" replied Laffitte.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis the poet Béranger threw all his influence into the\r\nparty of the Duke of Orleans, and almost at the same moment appeared\r\na placard on all the walls of Paris:--\r\n\r\n  \"Charles X. is deposed.\r\n  A Republic would embroil us with all Europe.\r\n  The Duke of Orleans is devoted to the cause of the Revolution.\r\n  The Duke of Orleans never made war on France.\r\n  The Duke of Orleans fought at Jemappes.\r\n  The Duke of Orleans will be a Citizen-King.\r\n  The Duke of Orleans has worn the tricolor under fire: he\r\n    will wear the tricolor as king.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, early on the evening of the 29th, Neuilly had been menaced\r\nby the troops under the Duc d'Angoulême, and Madame Adélaïde had\r\npersuaded her brother to quit the place. When M. Thiers and the\r\nartist, Ary Scheffer, arrived at Neuilly, bearing a request that\r\nthe Duke of Orleans would appear in Paris, Marie Amélie received\r\nthem. Aunt to the Duchesse de Berri and attached to the reigning\r\nfamily, she was shocked by the idea that her husband and her children\r\nmight rise upon their fall; but Madame Adélaïde exclaimed: \"Let\r\nthe Parisians make my brother what they please,--President, _Garde\r\nNational_, or Lieutenant-General,--so long as they do not make\r\nhim an exile.\"\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe, who was at Raincy (or supposed to be there, for\r\nthe envoys always believed he was behind a curtain during their\r\ninterview with his wife and sister), having received a message from\r\nMadame Adélaïde, set out soon after for Paris. The resolution of\r\nthe leaders of the Revolution had been taken, but in the Municipal\r\nCommune at the Hôtel-de-Ville there was still much excitement.\r\nThere a party desired a republic, and offered to place Lafayette\r\nat its head.\r\n\r\nAt Saint-Cloud the Duchesse de Berri and her son had been sent off\r\nto the Trianon; but the king remained behind. He referred everything\r\nto the dauphin (the Duc d'Angoulême); the dauphin referred everything\r\nto the king.\r\n\r\nThe dauphin's temper was imperious, and at this crisis it involved\r\nhim in a personal collision with Marshal Marmont. In attempting\r\nto tear the marshal's sword from his side, he cut his fingers. At\r\nsight of the royal blood the marshal was arrested, and led away as\r\na traitor. The king, however, at once released him, with apologies.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaders in Paris had decided to offer the\r\nlieutenant-generalship of France to Louis Philippe during the minority\r\nof the Duc de Bordeaux, he could not be found. He was not at Raincy,\r\nhe was not at Neuilly. About midnight, July 29, he entered Paris on\r\nfoot and in plain clothes, having clambered over the barricades.\r\nHe at once made his way to his own residence, the Palais Royal,\r\nand there waited events.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the Duchesse de Berri was leaving Saint-Cloud with\r\nher son. Before daylight Charles X. followed them to the Trianon; and\r\nthe soldiers in the Park at Saint-Cloud, who for twenty-four hours\r\nhad eaten nothing, were breaking their fast on dainties brought\r\nout from the royal kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe proposal that Louis Philippe should accept the\r\nlieutenant-generalship was brought to him on the morning of July\r\n30, after the proposition had first been submitted to Talleyrand, who\r\nsaid briefly: \"Let him accept it.\" Louis Philippe did so, accepting\r\nat the same time the tricolor, and promising a charter which should\r\nguarantee parliamentary privileges. He soon after appeared at a\r\nwindow of the Hôtel-de-Ville, attended by Lafayette and Laffitte,\r\nbearing the tricolored flag between them, and was received with\r\nacclamations by the people. But there were men in Paris who still\r\ndesired a republic, with Lafayette at its head. Lafayette persisted\r\nin assuring them that what France wanted was a king surrounded\r\nby republican institutions, and he commended Louis Philippe to\r\nthem as \"the best of republics.\" This idea in a few hours rapidly\r\ngained ground.\r\n\r\nBy midday on July 30th Paris was resuming its usual aspect. Charles\r\nX., finding that the household troops were no longer to be depended\r\non, determined to retreat over the frontier, and left the Trianon\r\nfor the small palace of Rambouillet, where Marie Louise and the King\r\nof Rome had sought refuge in the first hours of their adversity.\r\n\r\nThe king reached Rambouillet in advance of the news from Paris,[1]\r\nand great was the surprise of the guardian of the Château to see\r\nhim drive up in a carriage and pair with only one servant to attend\r\nhim. The king pushed past the keeper of the palace, who was walking\r\nslowly backward before him, and turned abruptly into a small room\r\non the ground floor, where he locked himself in and remained for\r\nmany hours. When he came forth, his figure seemed to have shrunk,\r\nhis complexion was gray, his eyes were red and swollen. He had\r\nspent his time in burning up old love-letters,--reminiscences of\r\na lady to whom he had been deeply attached in his youth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: All the Year Round, 1885.]\r\n\r\nThe mob of Paris having ascertained that the fugitive royal family\r\nwere pausing at Rambouillet, about twelve miles from the capital,\r\nset out to see what mischief could be done in that direction. The\r\nDuchesse de Berri, her children, and the Duc d'Angoulême were at the\r\nChâteau de Maintenon, and the king, upon the approach of the mob,\r\ncomposed only of roughs, determined to join them. As he passed out of\r\nthe chateau, which he had used as a hunting-lodge, he stretched out\r\nhis hand with a gesture of despair to grasp those of some friends\r\nwho had followed him to Rambouillet, and who were waiting for his\r\norders. He had none to give them. He spoke no word of advice, but\r\nwalked down the steps to his carriage, and was driven to the Château\r\nde Maintenon to rejoin his family.\r\n\r\nThe mob, when it found that the king had fled, was persuaded to\r\nquit Rambouillet by having some of the most brutal among them put\r\ninto the king's coaches. Attended by the rest of the unruly crowd,\r\nthey were driven back to Paris, and assembling before the Palais\r\nRoyal, shouted to Louis Philippe: \"We have brought you your coaches.\r\nCome out and receive them!\" Eighteen years later, these coaches\r\nwere consumed in a bonfire in the Place du Carrousel.\r\n\r\nAt the Château de Maintenon all was confusion and discouragement,\r\nwhen suddenly the dauphine (the Duchesse d'Angoulême) arrived.\r\nShe, whom Napoleon had said was the only man of her family, was in\r\nBurgundy when she received news of the outbreak of the Revolution.\r\nAt once she crossed several provinces of France in disguise. Harsh\r\nof voice, stern of look, cold in her bearing, she was nevertheless\r\na favorite with the household troops whose spirit was reanimated\r\nby the sight of her.\r\n\r\nFrom Rambouillet the king had sent his approbation of the appointment\r\nof the Duke of Orleans as lieutenant-general during the minority\r\nof Henri V. Louis Philippe's answer to this communication so well\r\nsatisfied the old king that he persuaded the dauphin to join with\r\nhim in abdicating all rights in favor of Henri V., the little Duc\r\nde Bordeaux. Up to this moment Charles seems never to have suspected\r\nthat more than such an abdication could be required of him. But\r\nby this time it was evident that the successful Parisians would\r\nbe satisfied with nothing less than the utter overthrow of the\r\nBourbons. Their choice lay between a constitutional monarchy with\r\nLouis Philippe at its head, or a renewal of the attempt to form\r\na republic.\r\n\r\nThe populace, on hearing that the abdication of the king and of the\r\ndauphin had been announced to the Chamber of Deputies, assembled\r\nto the number of sixty thousand, and insisted on the trial and\r\nimprisonment of the late king. Hearing this, the royal family left\r\nthe Château de Maintenon the next morning, the king and the Duchesse\r\nd'Angoulême taking leave of their faithful troops, and desiring\r\nthem to return to Paris, there to make their submission to the\r\nlieutenant-general, \"who had taken all measures for their security\r\nand prosperity in the future.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the journey to Dreux, Charles X. appeared to those around\r\nhim to accept his misfortunes from the hand of Heaven. The Duchesse\r\nd'Angoulême, pale and self-contained, with all her wounds opened\r\nafresh, could hardly bring herself to quit France for the third\r\ntime. Her husband was stolid and stupid. The Duchesse de Berri\r\nwas almost gay.\r\n\r\nMeantime old stories were being circulated throughout France\r\ndiscrediting the legitimacy of the Duc de Bordeaux, the posthumous\r\nson of the Duc de Berri. He had been born seven months after his\r\nfather's death, at dead of night, with no doctor in attendance,\r\nnor any responsible witnesses to attest that he was heir to the\r\ncrown. Louis Philippe had protested against his legitimacy within\r\na week after his birth. There was no real reason for suspecting his\r\nparentage; nobody believes the slander now, but it is not surprising\r\nthat in times of such excitement, with such great interests at\r\nstake, the circumstances attending his birth should have provoked\r\nremark. They were both unfortunate and unusual.\r\n\r\nCharles X. was the calmest person in the whole royal party. He\r\nwas chiefly concerned for the comfort of the rest. The dauphine\r\nwept, her husband trembled, the children were full of excitement\r\nand eager for play. Charles was unmoved, resigned; only the sight\r\nof a tricolored flag overcame him.\r\n\r\nHe complained much of the haste with which he was escorted through\r\nFrance to Cherbourg; but that haste probably insured his safety.\r\nAt Cherbourg two ships awaited him,--the \"Great Britain\" and the\r\n\"Charles Carroll;\" both were American-built, and both had formed\r\npart of the navy of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe day was fine when the royal fugitives embarked. In a few hours\r\nthey were off the Isle of Wight. For several days they stayed on\r\nboard, waiting till the English Government should complete arrangements\r\nwhich would enable them to land. They had come away almost without\r\nclothes, and the Duchesses of Angoulême and Berri were indebted for\r\nan outfit to an ex-ambassadress. The king said to some of those\r\nwho came on board to see him, that he and his son had retired into\r\nprivate life, and that his grandson must wait the progress of events;\r\nalso, that his conscience reproached him with nothing in his conduct\r\ntowards his people.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days the party landed in England and took up their\r\nabode at Ludworth Castle. Afterwards, at the king's own request,\r\nthe old Palace of Holyrood, in Edinburgh, was assigned him. There\r\nwas some fear at the time lest popular feeling should break out\r\nin some insult to him or his family. To avert this, Sir Walter\r\nScott, though then in failing health, wrote in a leading Edinburgh\r\nnewspaper as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"We are enabled to announce from authority that Charles of Bourbon,\r\nthe ex-king of France, is about to become once more our fellow-citizen,\r\nthough probably only for a limited space, and is presently about to\r\ninhabit the apartments again that he so long occupied in Holyrood\r\nHouse. This temporary arrangement has been made, it is said, in\r\ncompliance with his own request, with which our benevolent monarch\r\nimmediately complied, willing to consult in every way possible\r\nthe feelings of a prince under pressure of misfortunes, which are\r\nperhaps the more severe if incurred through bad advice, error, or\r\nrashness. The attendants of the late sovereign will be reduced\r\nto the least possible number, and consist chiefly of ladies and\r\nchildren, and his style of life will be strictly retired. In these\r\ncircumstances it would be unworthy of us as Scotchmen, or as men,\r\nif this unfortunate family should meet with a word or a look from\r\nthe meanest individual tending to aggravate feelings which must\r\nbe at present so acute as to receive injury from insults, which\r\nin other times would be passed over with perfect disregard. His\r\nlate opponents in his kingdom have gained the applause of Europe\r\nfor the generosity with which they have used their victory, and\r\nthe respect which they have paid to themselves in their moderation\r\ntowards an enemy. It would be a great contrast to that part of\r\ntheir conduct which has been most generally applauded, were we,\r\nwho are strangers to the strife, to affect a deeper resentment\r\nthan those concerned more closely. Those who can recollect the\r\nformer residence of this unhappy prince in our Northern capital\r\ncannot but remember the unobtrusive, quiet manner in which his\r\nlittle court was then conducted, and now, still further restricted\r\nand diminished, he may naturally expect to be received with civility\r\nand respect by a nation whose good will he has done nothing to\r\nforfeit. Whatever may have been his errors towards his own subjects,\r\nwe cannot but remember in his adversity that he did not in his\r\nprosperity forget that Edinburgh had extended him her hospitality,\r\nbut that at the period when the fires consumed so much of our city,\r\nhe sent a princely benefaction to the sufferers.... If there be\r\nany who entertain angry or invidious recollections of late events\r\nin France, they ought to remark that the ex-monarch has by his\r\nabdication renounced the conflict, into which perhaps he was engaged\r\nby bad advice, that he can no longer be an object of resentment\r\nto the brave, but remains, to all, the most striking example of\r\nthe instability of human affairs which our unstable times have\r\nafforded. He may say, with our own deposed Richard,--\r\n\r\n  'With mine own hands I washed away my blame;\r\n  With mine own hands I gave away my crown;\r\n  With my own tongue deny my sacred state.'\r\n\r\n\"He brings among us his 'gray, discrownèd head,' and in a 'nation\r\nof gentlemen,' as we were emphatically termed by the very highest\r\nauthority, it is impossible, I trust, to find a man mean enough\r\nto insult the slightest hair of it.\"\r\n\r\nCharles X. was greatly indebted to this letter for the cordiality\r\nof his reception at Edinburgh, where he lived in dignified retirement\r\nfor about two years; then, finding that the climate was too cold\r\nfor his old age, and that the English Government was disquieted\r\nbecause of the attempts of the Duchesse de Berri to revive her\r\nson's claims to the French throne, he made his way to Bohemia,\r\nand lived for a while in the Castle of Prague. At last he decided\r\nto make his final residence in the Tyrol, not far from the warm\r\nclimate of Italy. It is said that as the exiled, aged king cast\r\na last look at the Gothic towers of the Castle of Prague, he said\r\nto those about him: \"We are leaving yonder walls, and know not to\r\nwhat we may be going, like the patriarchs who knew not as they\r\njourneyed where they would pitch their tents.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Memoirs of the Duchesse d'Angoulême.]\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Baths of Töplitz, where the waters seemed to agree\r\nwith him, and where he wished to rest awhile, he found it needful\r\nto \"move on,\" for the house he occupied had been engaged for the\r\nking of Prussia. The cholera, too, was advancing. The exiled party\r\nreached Budweiz, a mountain village with a rustic inn, and there\r\nit was forced to halt for some weeks, for the Duc de Bordeaux was\r\ntaken ill with cholera. It was a period of deep anxiety to those\r\nabout him, but at last he recovered.\r\n\r\nAfter trying several residences in the Tyrolese mountains, to which\r\nthe old king had gone largely in hopes that he might enjoy the\r\npleasures of the chase, the exiled family fixed its residence at\r\nGoritz towards the end of October, 1836. The king was then in his\r\neightieth year, but so hale and active that he spent whole mornings\r\non foot, with his gun, upon the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe weather changed soon after the family had settled at Goritz.\r\nThe keen winter winds blew down from the snow mountains, but the\r\nking did not give up his daily sport. One afternoon, after a cold\r\nmorning spent upon the hills, he was seized at evening service\r\nin the chapel with violent spasms. These passed off, but on his\r\njoining his family later, its members were struck by the change\r\nin his appearance. In a few hours he seemed to have aged years.\r\nAt night he grew so ill that extreme unction was administered to\r\nhim. It was an attack of cholera. When dying, he blessed his little\r\ngrandchildren, the boy and girl, who, notwithstanding the nature of\r\nhis illness, were brought to him. \"God preserve you, dear children,\"\r\nhe said. \"Walk in paths of righteousness. Don't forget me.... Pray\r\nfor me sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nHe died Nov. 6, 1836, just one week after Louis Napoleon made his\r\nfirst attempt to have himself proclaimed Emperor of the French,\r\nat Strasburg.\r\n\r\nHe was buried near Goritz, in a chapel belonging to the Capuchin\r\nFriars. In another chapel belonging to the same lowly order in\r\nVienna, had been buried four years before, another claimant to the\r\nFrench throne, the Duc de Reichstadt, the only son of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nOn the coffin of the ex-king was inscribed,--\r\n\r\n\"Here lieth the High, the Potent, and most Excellent Prince, Charles\r\nTenth of that name; by the Grace of God King of France and of Navarre.\r\nDied at Goritz, Nov. 6, 1836, aged 79 years and 28 days.\"\r\n\r\nAll the courts of Europe put on mourning for him, that of France\r\nexcepted. The latter part of his life, with its reverses and\r\nhumiliations, he considered an expiation, not for his political\r\nerrors, but for the sins of his youth.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near his end, his yearnings after his lost country increased\r\nmore and more. He firmly believed that the day would come when his\r\nfamily would be restored to the throne of France, but he believed\r\nthat it would not be by conspiracy or revolt, but by the direct\r\ninterposition of God. That time did almost come in 1871, after\r\nthe Commune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLOUIS PHILIPPE AND HIS FAMILY.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe, after accepting the lieutenant-generalship of the\r\nkingdom, which would have made him regent under Henri V., found\r\nhimself raised by the will of the people--or rather, as some said,\r\nby the will of the _bourgeoisie_--to the French throne. He reigned,\r\nnot by \"right divine,\" but as the chosen ruler of his countrymen,--to\r\nmark which distinction he took the title of King of the French,\r\ninstead of King of France, which had been borne by his predecessors.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary for us to enter largely into French politics\r\nat this period. The government was supposed to be a monarchy planted\r\nupon republican institutions. The law recognized no hereditary\r\naristocracy. There was a chamber of peers, but the peers bore no\r\ntitles, and were chosen only for life. The dukes, marquises, and\r\ncounts of the old régime retained their titles only by courtesy.\r\n\r\nThe ministers of Charles X. were arrested and tried. The new king\r\nwas very anxious to secure their personal safety, and did so at a\r\nconsiderable loss of his own popularity. They were condemned to\r\nlose all property and all privileges, and were sent to the strong\r\nfortress of Ham. After a few years they were released, and took\r\nrefuge in England.\r\n\r\nThere were riots in Paris when it was known that the ministers\r\nand ill-advisers of the late king were not to be executed; one\r\nof the leaders in these disturbances was an Italian bravo named\r\nFieschi,--a man base, cruel, and bold, whom Louis Blanc calls a\r\n_scélérat bel esprit_.\r\n\r\nThe _émeute_ which was formidable, was suppressed chiefly by a\r\ngallant action on the part of the king, who, while his health was\r\nunimpaired, was never wanting in bravery. \"The king of the French,\"\r\nsays Greville, \"has put an end to the disturbances in Paris about\r\nthe sentence of the ministers by an act of personal gallantry. At\r\nnight, when the streets were most crowded and agitated, he sallied\r\nfrom the Palais Royal on horseback, with his son, the Duc de Nemours,\r\nand his personal _cortège_, and paraded through Paris for two hours.\r\nThat did the business. He was received with shouts of applause,\r\nand at once reduced everything to tranquillity. He deserves his\r\nthrone for this, and will probably keep it.\"\r\n\r\nThe next trouble in the new reign was the alienation of public\r\nfavor from Lafayette, who had done so much to place the king upon\r\nthe throne. He was accused by one party of truckling to the new\r\ncourt, by the other of being too much attached to revolutionary\r\nmethods and republican institutions. He was removed from the command\r\nof the National Guard, and his office of commander-in-chief of\r\nthat body was abolished.\r\n\r\nAll Europe becomes \"a troubled sea\" when a storm breaks over France.\r\n\"I never remember,\" writes Greville at this period, \"days like\r\nthese, nor read of such,--the terror and lively expectation that\r\nprevails, and the way in which people's minds are turned backward and\r\nforward from France to Ireland, then range exclusively from Poland\r\nto Piedmont, and fix again on the burnings, riots, and executions\r\nthat are going on in England.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime France was subsiding into quiet, with occasional slight\r\nshocks of revolutionary earthquake, before returning to order and\r\npeace. The king was _le bon bourgeois_. He had lived a great deal\r\nin England and the United States, and spoke English well. He had\r\neven said in his early youth that he was more of an Englishman\r\nthan a Frenchman. He was short and stout. His head was shaped like\r\na pear, and was surmounted by an elaborate brown wig; for in those\r\ndays people rarely wore their own gray hair.\r\n\r\nHe did not impress those who saw him as being in any way majestic;\r\nindeed, he looked like what he was,--_le bon père de famille_.\r\nAs such he would have suited the people of England; but it was\r\n_un vert galant_ like Henri IV., or royalty incarnate, like Louis\r\nXIV., who would have fired the imagination of the French people.\r\nAs a good father of a family, Louis Philippe felt that his first\r\nduty to his children was to secure them a good education, good\r\nmarriages, and sufficient wealth to make them important personages\r\nin any sudden change of fortune.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his accession all his children were unmarried,--indeed,\r\nonly four of them were grown up. The sons all went to _collège_,--which\r\nmeans in France what high-school does with us. Their mother's\r\ndressing-room at Neuilly was hung round with the laurel-crowns,\r\ndried and framed, which had been won by her dear school-boys.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son, Ferdinand, Duke of Orleans, was an extraordinarily\r\nfine young man, far more a favorite with the French people than his\r\nfather. Had he not been killed in a carriage accident in 1842, he\r\nmight now, in his old age, have been seated on the French throne.\r\n\r\nOne of the first objects of the king was to secure for his heir\r\na suitable marriage. A Russian princess was first thought of; but\r\nthe Czar would not hear of such a _mésalliance_. Then the hand of an\r\nAustrian archduchess was sought, and the young lady showed herself\r\nwell pleased with the attentions of so handsome and accomplished a\r\nsuitor; but her family were as unfavorable to the match as was the\r\nCzar of Russia. Finally, the Duke of Orleans had to content himself\r\nwith a German Protestant princess, Hélène of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,\r\na woman above all praise, who bore him two sons,--the Comte de\r\nParis, born in 1838, and the Duc de Chartres, born a year or two\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe eldest daughter of Louis Philippe, the Princess Louise, was\r\nmarried, soon after her father's elevation to the throne, to King\r\nLeopold of Belgium, widower of the English Princess Charlotte, and\r\nuncle to Prince Albert and to Queen Victoria. The French princess\r\nthus became, by her marriage, aunt to these high personages. They\r\nwere deeply attached to her. She named her eldest daughter Charlotte,\r\nafter the lamented first wife of her husband. The name was Italianized\r\ninto Carlotta,--the poor Carlotta whose reason and happiness were\r\ndestroyed by the misfortunes of her husband in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe second son of Louis Philippe was the Duc de Nemours,--a _blond_,\r\nstiff young officer who was never a favorite with the French, though\r\nhe distinguished himself in Algeria as a soldier. He too found it\r\nhard to satisfy his father's ambition by a brilliant marriage,\r\nthough a throne was offered him, which he had to refuse. He then\r\naspired to the hand of Maria da Gloria, the queen of Portugal;\r\nbut he married eventually a pretty little German princess of the\r\nCoburg race.\r\n\r\nThe third son was Philippe, Prince de Joinville, the sailor. He\r\nchose a bride for himself at the court of Brazil, and brought her\r\nhome in his frigate, the \"Belle Poule.\"\r\n\r\nThe charming artist daughter of Louis Philippe, the Princess Marie,\r\npupil and friend of Ary Scheffer, the artist, married the Duke of\r\nWürtemberg, and died early of consumption. Her only child was sent\r\nto France, and placed under the care of his grandmother. Princess\r\nClémentine married a colonel in the Austrian service, a prince\r\nof the Catholic branch of the house of Coburg. Her son is Prince\r\nFerdinand, the present ruler of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Louis Philippe's fifth son, the Duc de Montpensier,\r\nwith the Infanta Luisa is so closely connected with Louis Philippe's\r\ndownfall that it can be better told elsewhere; but we may here\r\nsay a few words about the fortunes of Henri, Duc d'Aumale, the\r\nking's fourth son, who has proved himself a man brave, generous,\r\npatriotic and high-minded, a soldier, a statesman, an historian,\r\npatron of art, and in all these things a man eminent among his\r\nfellows. He was only a school-boy when a tragic and discreditable\r\nevent made him heir of the great house of Condé, and endowed him\r\nwith wealth that he refuses to pass on to his family, proposing\r\nat his death to present it to the French people and the French\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nThe royal family of the house of Bourbon was divided in France into\r\nthree branches,--the reigning branch, the head of which was Charles\r\nX.; the Orleans branch, the head of which was Louis Philippe; and\r\nthe Condé branch, the chief of which, and its sole representative\r\nat this period, was the aged Duke of Bourbon, whose only son, the\r\nPrince d'Enghien, had been shot by order of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThis old man, rich, childless, and miserable, had had a romantic\r\nhistory. When very young he had fallen violently in love with his\r\ncousin, the Princess Louise of Orleans. He was permitted to marry\r\nher, but only on condition that they should part at the church\r\ndoor,--she to enter a convent for two years, he to serve for the\r\nsame time in the French army. They were married with all pomp and\r\nceremony; but that night the ardent bridegroom scaled the walls\r\nof the convent and bore away his bride. Unhappily their mutual\r\nattachment did not last long. \"It went out,\" says a contemporary\r\nmemoir-writer, \"like a fire of straw.\"[1] At last hatred took the\r\nplace of love, and the quarrels between the Prince de Condé (as\r\nthe Duc de Bourbon was then called) and his wife were among the\r\nscandals of the court of Louis XVI., and helped to bring odium\r\non the royal family.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Madame d'Oberkirch.]\r\n\r\nThe only child of this marriage was the Duc d'Enghien. The princess\r\ndied in the early days of the Revolution. Her husband formed the\r\narmy of French _émigrés_ at Coblentz, and led them when they invaded\r\ntheir own country. On the death of his father he became Duke of\r\nBourbon, but his promising son, D'Enghien, was already dead. The\r\nduke married while in exile the princess of Monaco, a lady of very\r\nshady antecedents. She was, however, received by Louis XVIII. in\r\nhis little court at Hartwell. She died soon after the Restoration.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the old duke, worn out with sorrows and excesses, was completely\r\nunder the power of an English adventuress, a Madame de Feuchères.[1]\r\nHe had settled on her his Château de Saint-Leu, together with very\r\nlarge sums of money. Several years before 1830 it had occurred to\r\nMadame de Feuchères that the De Rohans, who were related to the\r\nduke on his mother's side, might dispute these gifts and bequests,\r\nand by way of making herself secure, she sought the protection\r\nof Louis Philippe, then Duke of Orleans. She offered to use her\r\ninfluence with the Duke of Bourbon to induce him to make the Duc\r\nd'Aumale, who was his godson, his heir, if Louis Philippe would\r\nengage to stand her friend in any trouble.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Louis Blanc.]\r\n\r\nThe relations of the Duc de Bourbon to this woman bore a strong\r\nresemblance to those that Thackeray has depicted between Becky\r\nSharp and Jos Sedley. The old man became thoroughly in fear of\r\nher; and when the Revolution broke out later, he was also much\r\nafraid of being plundered and maltreated at Saint-Leu by the\r\npopulace,--not, however, because he had any great regard for his\r\ncousin Charles X., with whom in his youth he had fought a celebrated\r\nduel. Impelled by these two fears, he resolved to escape secretly\r\nfrom France, and so rid himself of the tyranny of Madame de Feuchères\r\nand the dangers of Revolution.\r\n\r\nHe arranged his flight with a trusted friend; it was fixed for\r\nthe day succeeding Aug. 31, 1830,--a month after the Revolution.\r\nThat evening he retired to his chamber in good spirits, though\r\nhe said good-night more impressively than usual to some persons\r\nin his household. The next morning he was found dead, hanging to\r\none of the _espagnolettes_, or heavy fastenings, of a tall French\r\nwindow. The village authorities were summoned; but although it\r\nwas impossible a man so infirm could have thus killed himself and\r\nthough many other circumstances proved that he did not die by his\r\nown hand, they certified his death by suicide. The Catholic Church,\r\nhowever, did not accept this verdict, and the duke was buried with\r\nthe rites of religion.\r\n\r\nThere was certainly no proof that Madame de Feuchères had had any\r\nhand in the murder of the old man who had plotted to escape from\r\nher, and who had expressed to others his dread of the tyranny she\r\nexercised over him; but there was every ground for strong suspicion,\r\nand the public lost no time in fastening part of the odium that\r\nattached to the supposed murderess on the king, whose family had\r\nso greatly benefited by her influence over the last head of the\r\nhouse of Condé. She retained her ill-gotten wealth, and removed\r\nat once to Paris. She had been engaged in stock operations for\r\nsome time, and now gave herself up to them, winning enormous sums.\r\n\r\nThe new throne was sadly shaken by these events, added to discontents\r\nconcerning the king's prudent policy of non-intervention in the\r\nattempted revolutions of other countries, which followed that of\r\nFrance in 1830 and 1831. The next very interesting event of this\r\nreign was the escapade and the discomfiture of the young Duchesse\r\nde Berri.\r\n\r\nAbout the close of 1832, while France and all Europe were still\r\nexperiencing the after-shocks which followed the Revolution of\r\nJuly, Marie Caroline, the Duchesse de Berri, planned at Holyrood\r\na descent upon France in the interests of the Duc de Bordeaux,\r\nher son.[1] Had he reigned in consequence of the deaths of his\r\ngrandfather and uncle, Charles X. and the Duc d'Angoulême, the\r\nduchess his mother was to have been regent during his minority.\r\nShe regretted her inaction during the days of July, when, had she\r\ntaken her son by the hand and presented him herself to the people,\r\nrenouncing in his name and her own all ultra-Bourbon traditions\r\nand ideas, she might have saved the dynasty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Louis Blanc and papers in \"Figaro.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIE CAROLINE FERDINANDE LOUISE, DUCHESSE DE BERRY.\r\nNée à Naples, le 5 Novembre 1798.]\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this regret, and fired by the idea of becoming\r\nanother Jeanne d'Albret, she urged her plans on Charles X., who\r\ndecidedly disapproved of them; but \"the idea of crossing the seas\r\nat the head of faithful paladins, of landing after the perils and\r\nadventures of an unpremeditated voyage in a country of knights-errant,\r\nof eluding by a thousand disguises the vigilance of enemies through\r\nwhom she had to pass, of wandering, a devoted mother and a banished\r\nqueen, from hamlet to hamlet and from château to château, appealing\r\nto human nature high and low on its romantic side, and at the end of\r\na victorious conspiracy unfurling in France the ancient standard of\r\nthe monarchy, was too dazzling not to attract a young, high-spirited\r\nwoman, bold through her very ignorance, heroic through mere levity,\r\nable to endure anything but depression and _ennui_, and prepared to\r\noverbear all opposition with plausible platitudes about a mother's\r\nlove.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Louis Blanc, Histoire de Dix Ans.]\r\n\r\nAt last Charles X. consented to let her follow her own wishes;\r\nbut he placed her under the guardianship of the Duc de Blancas.\r\nShe set out through Holland and the Tyrol for Italy. She travelled\r\n_incognita_, of course. Charles Albert, of Sardinia, received her\r\nat Turin with great personal kindness, and lent her a million of\r\nfrancs,--which he borrowed from a nobleman of his court under pretence\r\nof paying the debts of his early manhood; but he was forced to\r\nrequest her to leave his dominions, and she took refuge with the\r\nDuke of Modena, who assigned her a palace at Massa, about three\r\nmiles from the Mediterranean. A rising was to be made simultaneously\r\nin Southern France and in La Vendée. Lyons had just been agitated\r\nby a labor insurrection, and Marseilles was the first point at\r\nwhich it was intended to strike.\r\n\r\nThe Legitimists in France were divided into two parties. One, under\r\nChateaubriand and Marshal Victor, the Duc de Bellune, wished to\r\nrestore Henri V. only by parliamentary and legal victories; the\r\nother, favored by the court at Holyrood, was for an armed intervention\r\nof the Great Powers. The Duc de Blancas was considered its head.\r\n\r\nThe question of the invasion of France with foreign troops was\r\nexcitedly argued at Massa. The duchess wished above all things to\r\nget rid of the tutelage of M. de Blancas, and she was disposed to\r\nfavor, to a certain extent, the more moderate views of Chateaubriand.\r\nAfter endless quarrels she succeeded in sending off the duke to\r\nHolyrood, and was left to take her own way.\r\n\r\nApril 14, 1832, was fixed upon for leaving Massa. It was given out\r\nthat the duchess, was going to Florence. At nightfall a carriage,\r\ncontaining the duchess, with two ladies and a gentleman of her\r\nsuite, drove out of Massa and waited under the shadow of the city\r\nwall. While a footman was absorbing the attention of the coachman\r\nby giving him some minute, unnecessary orders, Madame (as they\r\ncalled the duchess) slipped out of the carriage door with one of her\r\nladies, while two others, who were standing ready in the darkness,\r\ntook their places. The carriage rolled away towards Florence, while\r\nMadame and her party, stealing along under the dark shadow of the\r\ncity wall, made their way to the port, where a steamer was to take\r\nthem on board.\r\n\r\nThat steamer was the \"Carlo Alberto,\" a little vessel which had\r\nbeen already used by some republican conspirators, and had been\r\npurchased for the service of Marie Caroline. It had some of her\r\nmost devoted adherents on board, but the captain was in ignorance.\r\nHe thought himself bound for Genoa, and was inclined to disobey\r\nwhen his passengers ordered him to lay to off the harbor of Massa.\r\nHowever, they used force, and at three in the morning Marie Caroline,\r\nwho was sleeping, wrapped in her cloak, upon the sand, was roused,\r\nput on board a little boat, and carried out to the steamer. She\r\nhad a tempestuous passage of four days to Marseilles. The steamer\r\nran out of coal, and had to put into Nice. At last, in a heavy sea\r\nwhich threatened to dash small craft to pieces, a fishing-boat\r\napproached the \"Carlo Alberto,\" containing some of the duchess's\r\nmost devoted friends. With great danger she was transferred to\r\nit, and was landed on the French coast. She scrambled up slippery\r\nand precipitous rocks, and reached a place of safety. But the delay\r\nin the arrival of her steamer had been fatal to her enterprise.\r\nA French gentleman in the secret had hired a small boat, and put\r\nout to sea in the storm to see if he could perceive the missing\r\nvessel. His conduct excited the suspicion of his crew, who talked\r\nabout it at a wine-shop, where they met other sailors, who had their\r\nstory to tell of a lady landed mysteriously a few hours before at a\r\ndangerous and lonely spot a few miles away. The two accounts soon\r\nreached the ears of the police, and Marseilles was on the alert,\r\nwhen a party of young men, with their swords drawn and waving white\r\nhandkerchiefs, precipitated their enterprise, by appearing in the\r\nstreets and striving to rouse the populace. They were arrested, as\r\nwere also the passengers left on board the \"Carlo Alberto,\"--among\r\nthem was a lady who deceived the police into a belief that she was\r\nthe Duchesse de Bern.\r\n\r\nUnder cover of this mistake the duchess, finding that all hope\r\nwas over in the southern provinces, resolved to cross France to\r\nLa Vendée. At Massa she had had a dream. She thought the Duc de\r\nBern had appeared to her and said: \"You will not succeed in the\r\nSouth, but you will prosper in La Vendée.\"\r\n\r\nShe quitted the hut in which she had been concealed, made her way\r\non foot through a forest, lost herself, and had to sleep in the\r\nvacant cabin of a woodcutter. The next night she passed under the\r\nroof of a republican, who respected her sex and would not betray\r\nher. She then reached the château of a Legitimist nobleman with\r\nthe appropriate name of M. de Bonrecueil. Thence she started in\r\nthe morning in a postchaise to cross all France along its public\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nShe accomplished her journey in safety, and fixed May 24, 1832, as\r\nthe day for taking up arms. She made her headquarters at a Breton\r\nfarm-house, Les Meliers. She wore the costume of a boy,--a peasant\r\nof La Vendée--and called herself Petit Pierre.\r\n\r\nOn May 21, three days before the date fixed upon for the rising,\r\nshe was waited upon by the chiefs,--the men most likely to suffer\r\nin an abortive insurrection,--and was assured that the attempt would\r\nfail. Had the South risen, La Vendée would have gladly joined the\r\ninsurrection; but unsupported by the South, the proposed enterprise was\r\ntoo rash a venture. Overpowered by these arguments and the persuasions\r\nof those around her, Marie Caroline gave way, and consented to\r\nreturn to Scotland with a passport that had been provided for her.\r\nBut in the night she retracted her consent, and insisted that the\r\nrising should take place upon the 3d of June. She was obeyed; but\r\nwhat little prospect of success there might have been at first,\r\nwas destroyed by the counter-order of May 22. All who rose were at\r\nonce put down by the king's troops, and atrocities on both sides\r\nwere committed.\r\n\r\nNantes, the capital city of La Vendée, was hostile to the duchess;\r\nin Nantes, therefore, she believed her enemies would never search\r\nfor her. She took refuge there in the house of two elderly maiden\r\nladies, the Demoiselles Duguigney, where she remained five months.\r\nThey must have been months of anguish to her, and of unspeakable\r\nimpatience. It is very possible that the Government did not care\r\nto find her. She was the queen's niece, and if captured what could\r\nbe done with her? To set her free to hatch new plots would have\r\nbeen bitterly condemned by the republicans; to imprison her would\r\nhave made an additional motive for royalist conspiracies; to execute\r\nher would have been impossible. Marie Caroline, however, had solved\r\nthese difficult problems by her own misconduct.\r\n\r\nMeantime the premiership of France passed into the hands of M.\r\nThiers. A Jew--a Judas--named Deutz, came to him mysteriously,\r\nand bargained to deliver into his hands the Duchesse de Berri.\r\nThiers, who had none of the pity felt for her by the Orleans family,\r\nclosed with the offer. Some years before, Deutz had renounced his\r\nJewish faith and pretended to turn Christian. Pope Gregory XVI.\r\nhad patronized him, and had recommended him to the Duc de Berri as\r\na confidential messenger. He had frequently carried despatches of\r\nimportance, and knew that the duchess was in Nantes, but he did not\r\nknow her hiding-place. He contrived to persuade her to grant him an\r\ninterview. It took place at the Demoiselles Duguigney's house; but\r\nhe was led to believe that she only used their residence for that\r\npurpose. With great difficulty he procured a second interview, in\r\nthe course of which, having taken his measures beforehand, soldiers\r\nsurrounded the house. Before they could enter it, word was brought\r\nto the duchess that she was betrayed. She fled from the room, and\r\nwhen the soldiers entered they could not find her. They were certain\r\nthat she had not left the house. They broke everything to pieces,\r\nsounded the walls, ripped up the beds and furniture. Night came\r\non, and troops were left in every chamber. In a large garret, where\r\nthere was a wide fireplace, the soldiers collected some newspapers\r\nand light wood, and about midnight built a fire. Soon within the\r\nchimney a noise of kicking against an iron panel was heard, and\r\nvoices cried: \"Let us out,--we surrender!\"\r\n\r\nFor sixteen hours the duchess and two friends had been imprisoned\r\nin a tiny hiding-place, separated from the hearth by a thin iron\r\nsliding-panel, which, when the soldiers lit their fire, had grown\r\nred hot. The gentleman of the party was already badly burned, and\r\nthe women were nearly suffocated. The gendarmes kicked away the\r\nfire, the panel was pushed back, and the duchess, pale and fainting,\r\ncame forth and surrendered. The commander of the troops was sent\r\nfor. To him she said: \"General, I confide myself to your honor.\"\r\nHe answered, \"Madame, you are under the safeguard of the honor\r\nof France.\"\r\n\r\nThis capture was a great embarrassment to the Government. Pity\r\nfor the devoted mother, the persecuted princess, the brave,\r\nself-sacrificing woman, stirred thousands of hearts. The duchess\r\nwas sent at once to an old château called Blaye, on the banks of\r\nthe Gironde, the estuary formed by the junction of the Dordogne\r\nand the Garonne. Tradition said that the old castle had been built\r\nby the paladin Orlando (or Roland), and that he had been buried\r\nwithin its walls after he fell at Roncesvalles.\r\n\r\nIn this citadel the Duchesse de Berri was confined, with every\r\nprecaution against escape or rescue; and the restraint and monotony\r\nof such a life soon told upon a woman of her character. She could\r\nplay the heroine, acting well her part, with an admiring world\r\nfor her audience; but \"cabined, cribbed, confined\" in an old,\r\ndilapidated castle, her courage and her health gave way. She was\r\ncheered, however, at first by Legitimist testimonies of devotion.\r\nChateaubriand wrote her a memorable letter, imploring her, in the\r\nname of M. de Malesherbes, his ancestor who had defended Louis XVI.,\r\nto let him undertake her defence, if she were brought to trial; but\r\nthe reigning family of France had no wish to proceed to such an\r\nextremity. The duchess had not come of a stock in which all the\r\nwomen were _sans reproche_, like Marie Amélie. Her grandmother, Queen\r\nCaroline of Naples, the friend of Lady Hamilton and of Lord Nelson,\r\nhad been notoriously a bad woman; her sister, Queen Christina of\r\nSpain, had made herself equally famous; and doubts had already been\r\nthrown on the legitimacy of the son of the duchess, the posthumous\r\nchild of the Duc de Berri. The queen of France, who was almost a\r\nsaint, had been fond of her young relative for her many engaging\r\nqualities; and what to do with her, in justice to France, was a\r\ndifficult problem.\r\n\r\nTo the consternation and disgust of the Legitimists, the heroine\r\nof La Vendée dropped from her pedestal and sank into the mire.\r\n\"She lost everything,\" says Louis Blanc,--\"even the sympathy of\r\nthe most ultra-partisans of the Bourbon dynasty; and she deserved\r\nthe fate that overtook her. It was the sequel to the discovery of a\r\nterrible secret,--a secret whose publicity became a just punishment\r\nfor her having, in pursuit of her own purposes, let loose on France\r\nthe dogs of civil war.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of enthusiasm for her courage and pity for her fate,\r\nrose a rumor that the duchess would shortly give birth to a child.\r\nIt was even so. The news fell like a blow on the hearts of the\r\nroyalists. If she had made a clandestine, morganatic marriage, she\r\nhad by the law of France forfeited her position as regent during\r\nher son's minority; she had forgotten his claims on her and those\r\nof France. If there was no marriage, she had degraded herself past\r\nall sympathy. At any rate, now she was harmless. The policy of\r\nthe Government was manifestly to let her child be born at Blaye,\r\nand then send her to her Neapolitan home.\r\n\r\nHer desire was to leave Blaye before her confinement. In vain she\r\npleaded her health and a tendency to consumption. The Government\r\nsent physicians to Blaye, among them the doctor who had attended\r\nthe duchess after the birth of the Duc de Bordeaux; for it insisted\r\non having full proof of her disgrace before releasing her. But\r\nbefore this disgrace was announced in Paris, twelve ardent young\r\nLegitimists had bound themselves to fight twelve duels with twelve\r\nleading men of the opposite party, who might, if she were brought\r\nto trial, injure her cause. The first of these duels took place;\r\nArmand Carrel, the journalist, being the liberal champion, while\r\nM. Roux-Laborie fought for the duchess. The duel was with swords,\r\nand lasted three minutes. Twice Carrel wounded his adversary in\r\nthe arm; but as he rushed on him the third time, he received a\r\ndeep wound in the abdomen. The news spread through Paris. The prime\r\nminister, M. Thiers, sent his private secretary for authentic news\r\nof Carrel's state. The attendants refused to allow the wounded\r\nman to be disturbed. \"Let him see me,\" said Carrel; \"for I have\r\na favor to ask of M. Thiers,--that he will let no proceedings be\r\ntaken against M. Roux-Laborie.\"\r\n\r\nGovernment after this became anxious to quench the loyalty of the\r\nDuchesse de Berri's defenders as soon and as effectually as possible.\r\nThe duel with Armand Carrel was fought Feb. 2, 1833; on the 22d\r\nof February General Bugeaud, commander of the fortress of Blaye,\r\nreceived from the duchess the following declaration:--\r\n\r\n  Under the pressure of circumstances and of measures\r\n  taken by Government, I think it due to myself and to my\r\n  children (though I have had grave reasons for keeping my\r\n  marriage a secret) to declare that I have been privately\r\n  married during my late sojourn in Italy.\r\n                                  (Signed) MARIE CAROLINE.\r\n\r\nFrom that time up to the month of May the duchess continued to\r\nmake vain efforts to obtain her release before the birth of her\r\nchild. It had been intimated to her that she should be sent to\r\nPalermo as soon afterwards as she should be able to travel.\r\n\r\nThe Government took every precaution, that the event might be verified\r\nwhen it took place. Six or seven of the principal inhabitants of\r\nBlaye were stationed in an adjoining chamber, as is the custom\r\nat the birth of princes.\r\n\r\nA little girl having been born, these witnesses were summoned to\r\nthe chamber by Madame de Hautfort, the duchess's lady-in-waiting.\r\nThe duchess answered their questions firmly, and on returning to\r\nthe next room, her own physician declared on oath that the duchess\r\nwas the lawful wife of Count Hector Luchesi-Palli, of the family\r\nof Campo Formio, of Naples, gentleman of the bedchamber to the\r\nking of the Two Sicilies, living at Palermo.\r\n\r\nThis was the first intimation given of the parentage of the child.\r\nA mouth later, Marie Caroline and her infant embarked on board a\r\nFrench vessel, attended by Marshal Bugeaud, and were landed at\r\nPalermo. Very few of the duchess's most ardent admirers in former\r\ndays were willing to accompany her. Her baby died before it was\r\nmany months old. Charles X. refused to let her have any further\r\ncare or charge of her son. \"As Madame Luchesi-Palli,\" he said,\r\n\"she had forfeited all claims to royal consideration.\"\r\n\r\nA reconciliation, however, official rather than real, was patched\r\nup by Chateaubriand between the duchess and Charles X.; but her\r\npolitical career was over. She was allowed to see the Duc de Bordeaux\r\nfor two or three days once a year. The young prince was thenceforward\r\nunder the maternal care of his aunt, the Duchesse d'Angoulême. The\r\nDuchesse de Berri passed the remainder of her adventurous life in\r\ntranquillity. Her marriage with Count Luchesi-Palli was apparently\r\na happy one. They had four children. She owned a palace in Styria,\r\nand another on the Grand Canal at Venice, where she gave popular\r\nparties. In 1847 she gave some private theatricals, at which were\r\npresent twenty-seven persons belonging to royal or imperial families.\r\nHer buoyancy of spirit kept her always gay. One would have supposed\r\nthat she would be overwhelmed by the fall we have related. She\r\nwas good-natured, charitable, and extravagant. She died leaving\r\nheavy debts, which the Duc de Bordeaux paid for her. Her daughter\r\nLouise, sister of the Duc de Bordeaux, married the Duke of Parma,\r\nwho was assassinated in 1854. Their daughter married Don Carlos,\r\nwho claims at present to be rightful heir to the thrones of France\r\nand Spain. She died in 1864, shortly after the Count Luchesi-Palli.\r\nThe Duchesse de Berri, who in her later years became very devout,\r\n_d'après la manière Italienne_, as somebody has said, wrote thus\r\nabout his death:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been so tried that my poor head reels. The loss of my good\r\nand pious daughter made me almost crazy, but the care of my husband\r\nhad somewhat calmed me, when God took him to himself. He died like\r\na saint in my arms, with his children around him, smiling at me\r\nand pointing to heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe duchess died suddenly at Brussels in 1870, aged seventy-one.\r\n\"And,\" adds an intensely Legitimist writer from whom I have taken\r\nthese details of her declining years, \"had she lived till 1873, she\r\nwould have given her son better advice than that he followed.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mémoire de la Duchesse d'Angoulême.]\r\n\r\nWithout following the ins and outs of politics during the first ten\r\nyears of Louis Philippe's reign, which were checkered by revolts,\r\n_émeutes_, and attempts at regicide, I pass on to the next event\r\nof general interest,--the explosion of the \"infernal machine\" of\r\nFieschi.\r\n\r\nIt was customary for King Louis Philippe to make a grand military\r\npromenade through Paris on one of the three days of July which\r\nduring his reign were days of public festivity. On the morning of\r\nJuly 28, 1835, as the clock struck ten, the king, accompanied by\r\nhis three elder sons, Marshals Mortier and Lobeau, his ministers,\r\nhis staff, his household, and many generals, rode forth to review\r\nforty thousand troops along the Boulevards. At midday they reached\r\nthe Boulevard du Temple. There, as the king was bending forward\r\nto receive a petition, a sudden volley of musketry took place,\r\nand the pavement was strewed with dead and dying. Marshal Mortier\r\nwas killed, together with a number of officers of various grades,\r\nsome bystanders, a young girl, and an old man. The king had not been\r\nshot, but as his horse started, he had received a severe contusion\r\non the arm. The Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Joinville were\r\nslightly hurt. Smoke came pouring from the third-story windows of\r\na house (No. 50) on the Boulevard. A man sprang from the window,\r\nseized a rope hanging from the chimney, and swung himself on to\r\na lower roof. As he did so, he knocked down a flower-pot, which\r\nattracted attention to his movements. A police agent saw him, and\r\na national guard arrested him. He was in his shirt-sleeves, and his\r\nface was covered with blood. The infernal machine he had employed\r\nconsisted of twenty-five gun-barrels on a stand so constructed that\r\nthey could all be fired at once. Happily two did not go off, and\r\nfour burst, wounding the wretch who had fired them. Instantly the\r\nreception of the king, which had been cold when he set forth, changed\r\ninto rapturous enthusiasm. He and his sons had borne themselves\r\nwith the greatest bravery.\r\n\r\nThe queen had been about to quit the Tuileries to witness the review,\r\nwhen the door of her dressing-room was pushed open, and a colonel\r\nburst in, exclaiming: \"Madame, the king has been fired at. He is not\r\nhurt, nor the princes, but the Boulevard is strewn with corpses.\"\r\nThe queen, raising her trembling hands to heaven, waited only for\r\na repetition of his assurance that her dear ones were all safe,\r\nand then set out to find the king. She met him on the staircase,\r\nand husband and wife wept in each other's arms.\r\n\r\nThe queen then went to her sons, looked at them, and touched them,\r\nhardly able to believe that they were not seriously wounded, and\r\nturned away, shuddering, from the blood on M. Thiers' clothes.\r\nThen, returning to her chamber, she sent a note at once to her\r\nyounger boys, D'Aumale and Montpensier, who were with their tutors\r\nat the Château d'Eu. It began with these words: \"Fall down on your\r\nknees, my children; God has preserved your father.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the Legitimists, and likewise the Republicans, were accused\r\nof inspiring the attempt of Fieschi. The trials, that took place\r\nabout six months later, proved that the assassin Fieschi was a\r\nwretch bearing a strong resemblance to our own Guiteau.\r\n\r\nThe funeral ceremonies of the victims of the infernal machine were\r\ncelebrated with great pomp. The affair led to a partial reconciliation\r\nbetween the new Government and the Legitimist clergy; it led also\r\nto certain restrictions on the Press and an added stringency in\r\nthe punishment for crimes of the like character.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 31, 1836, the trial of the prisoners took place before\r\nthe Peers. The crowd of spectators was immense. There were five\r\nprisoners, but the eyes of the spectators were fixed on only three.\r\n\r\nThe first was a man under-sized, nervous and quick in his movements.\r\nHis face, which was disfigured by recent scars, had an expression\r\nof cunning and impudence. His forehead was narrow, his hair cropped\r\nclose, one corner of his mouth was disfigured by a scar, his smile\r\nwas insolent, and so was his whole bearing. He seemed anxious to\r\nconcentrate the attention of all present on himself, smiled and\r\nbowed to every one he knew, and seemed well satisfied with his\r\nodious importance.\r\n\r\nThe second was an old man, pale and ill. He bore himself with perfect\r\ncalmness. He seated himself where he was told to sit, and gave no\r\nsign of emotion throughout the trial.\r\n\r\nThe third was utterly prostrated by fear.\r\n\r\nThe first was Fieschi; the second was called Morey; the third was\r\na grocer named Pepin.\r\n\r\nThe two last had been arrested on the testimony of Nina Lassave,\r\nwho had had Fieschi for her lover. The life of this man had been\r\nalways base and infamous. He was a Corsican by birth, and had been\r\na French soldier. He had fought bravely, but after his discharge he\r\nhad been imprisoned for theft and counterfeiting. He led a wandering\r\nlife from town to town, living on his wits and indulging all his\r\nvices. He had even succeeded in getting some small favors from\r\nGovernment; but finding that he could not long escape punishment\r\nfor crimes known to the police, he undertook, apparently without any\r\nespecial motive, the wholesale murder of king, court, and princes.\r\n\r\nDuring his imprisonment his vanity had been so great that the officers\r\nof the Crown played upon it in order to obtain confessions and\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe only witness against Morey was Nina Lassave, who insisted that,\r\nFieschi having invented the murderous instrument, Morey had devised\r\na use for it, and that Pepin had furnished the necessary funds\r\nfor its completion.\r\n\r\nI give Louis Blanc's account of Fieschi's behavior on his trial,\r\nbecause when foreign nations have reproached us for the scandal\r\nof the license granted to the murderer of President Garfield on\r\nhis trial, I have never seen it remarked that Guiteau's conduct\r\nwas almost exactly like that of Fieschi.\r\n\r\n\"With effrontery, with a miserable kind of pride, and with smiles\r\nof triumph on his lips, he alluded to his victims with theatrical\r\ngesticulations, and plumed himself on the magnitude of his own\r\ninfamy, answering his judges by ignoble buffooneries, playing the\r\npart of an orator, making pretensions to learning, looking round\r\nto see what effect he was producing, and courting applause. And\r\nsome of those who sat in judgment on him _did_ applaud. At each\r\nof his atrocious vulgarisms many of the Peers laughed, and this\r\nlaugh naturally encouraged him. Did he make a movement to rise,\r\nvoices called out: 'Fieschi desires to say something, Monsieur le\r\nPrésident! Fieschi is about to speak!' The audience was unwilling\r\nto lose a word that might fall from the lips of so celebrated a\r\nscoundrel. He could hardly contain himself for pride and satisfaction.\r\nHis bloody hand was eager to shake hands with the public, and there\r\nwere those willing to submit to it. He exchanged signs with the\r\nwoman Nina who was seated in the audience. He posed before the\r\nspectators with infinite satisfaction. What more can we say? He\r\ndirected the proceedings. He prompted or browbeat the witnesses,\r\nhe undertook the duties of a prosecuting attorney. He regulated the\r\ntrial.... He directed coarse jokes at the unhappy Pepin; but reckless\r\nas he was, he dared not meddle with Morey. He had no hesitation in\r\naccusing himself. He owned himself the worst of criminals, and\r\ndeclared that he esteemed himself happy to be able to pay with\r\nhis own blood for the blood of the unhappy victims of his crime.\r\nBut the more he talked about his coming fate, the plainer it was\r\nthat he expected pardon, and the more he flattered those on whom\r\nthat pardon might depend.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted twelve days, and very little was elicited about\r\nthe conspiracy,--if indeed there was one. Suddenly Pepin, whose\r\nterror had been abject, rallied his courage, refused to implicate\r\nMorey or to make revelations, and kept his resolution to the last.\r\n\r\nOne of the five prisoners was acquitted, one was condemned to a\r\nbrief imprisonment, and Morey, Pepin, and Fieschi were sent to\r\nthe block. Up to almost the last moment Fieschi expected pardon;\r\nbut his last words were to his confessor: \"I wish I could let you\r\nknow about myself five minutes from now.\"\r\n\r\nOn the scaffold Morey's white hair elicited compassion from the\r\nspectators. Pepin at the last moment was offered a pardon if he\r\nwould tell whence the money came that he had advanced to Fieschi.\r\nHe refused firmly, and firmly met his fate.\r\n\r\nThe next day the woman who had betrayed her lover and the rest was\r\npresiding at a café on the Place de la Bourse, having been engaged\r\nas an attraction!\r\n\r\nAfter these horrors we turn with relief to some account of good\r\nand noble women, the ladies of Louis Philippe's family.\r\n\r\nAfter the murderous attempt of Fieschi the king lived under a continual\r\nexpectation of assassination. He no longer walked the streets of\r\nParis with his cane under his arm. When he drove, he sat with his\r\nback to the horses, because that position gave less certainty to\r\nthe aim of an assassin. It was said that his carriages were lined\r\nwith sheet-iron. He was thirteen times shot at, and the pallid\r\nlooks of the poor queen were believed to arise from continual\r\napprehension. Her nerves had been shaken by the diabolical attempt\r\nof Fieschi, and she never afterwards would leave her husband, even\r\nfor a few days. She stayed away from the deathbed of her daughter,\r\nthe Queen of the Belgians, lest in her absence he should be\r\nassassinated.\r\n\r\nNeuilly was the _home_ of the family, its beloved, particular retreat.\r\nThe greatest pang that Louis Philippe suffered in 1848 was its\r\ntotal destruction by rioters. The little palace was furnished in\r\nperfect taste, with elegance, yet with simplicity. The inlaid floors\r\nwere especially beautiful. The rooms were decorated with pictures,\r\nmany of them representing passages in the early life of the king.\r\nIn one he was teaching mathematics in a Swiss school; in another he\r\nwas romping with his children. His own cabinet was decorated with\r\nhis children's portraits and with works of art by his accomplished\r\ndaughter, the Princess Marie. The family sitting-room was furnished\r\nwith the princesses' embroidery, and there was a table painted\r\non velvet by the Duchesse de Berri. The library was large, and\r\ncontained many English books, among them a magnificent edition of\r\nShakspeare. The park enclosed one hundred acres. The gardens were\r\nlaid out in the English style. A branch of the Seine ran through\r\nthe grounds, with boat-houses and bath-houses for the pleasure\r\nof the young princes,--and in one night this cherished home was\r\nlaid in ruins!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _QUEEN MARIE AMÉLIE._]\r\n\r\n\"All is possible,\" said Louis Philippe to a visitor who talked\r\nwith him at Claremont in his exile, \"all is possible to France,--an\r\nempire, a republic, the Comte de Chambord, or my grandson; but one\r\nthing is impossible,--that any of these should last. _On a tué\r\nle respect_,--the nation has killed respect.\"\r\n\r\nQueen Marie Amélie was born in Naples in 1782. Her mother was a\r\ndaughter of Maria Theresa, and sister to Marie Antoinette. This lady\r\nwas not one who inspired respect, but she had some good qualities.\r\nShe was a good mother to her children, and had plenty of ability.\r\nOf course she hated the French Revolution, and everything that\r\nsavored of what are called liberal opinions. Her career, which\r\nwas full of vicissitudes and desperate plots, ended by her being\r\ndismissed ignominiously from Naples by the English ambassador,\r\nand she went to end her days with her nephew at Vienna.\r\n\r\nMarie Amélie used sometimes to tell her children how she had wept\r\nwhen a child for the death of the little dauphin, the eldest son\r\nof Louis XVI., who, before the Revolution broke out, was taken\r\naway from the evil to come. She was to have been married to him\r\nhad he lived. When older, she had an early love-affair with her\r\ncousin, Prince Antoine of Austria; but he was destined for the\r\nChurch, and the youthful courtship came to an untimely end. When\r\nshe first met her future husband, she and her family were living in\r\na sort of provisional exile in Palermo. The princess was twenty-seven,\r\nLouis Philippe was ten or twelve years older, and they seem to have\r\nbeen quite determined to marry each other very soon after their\r\nacquaintance began. It was not easy to do so, however, for the\r\nduke, as we have seen, was at that period too much a republican\r\nto suit even an English Admiral; but the princess declared that\r\nshe would go into a convent if the marriage was forbidden, and\r\non Dec. 25, 1809, she became the wife of Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nNo description could do justice to the purity and charity of this\r\nadmirable woman; and in her good works she was seconded by her\r\nsister-in-law, Madame Adélaïde, and by her daughter.\r\n\r\n\"The queen,\" her almoner tells us, \"had 500,000 francs a year for\r\nher personal expenses, and gave away 400,000 of them.\" \"M. Appert,\"\r\nshe would say to him, \"give those 500 francs we spoke of, but put\r\nthem down upon next month's account. The waters run low this month;\r\nmy purse is empty.\" An American lady, visiting the establishment\r\nof a great dressmaker in Paris, observed an old black silk dress\r\nhanging over a chair. She remarked with some surprise: \"I did not\r\nknow you would turn and fix up old dresses.\" \"I do so only for\r\nthe queen,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nThe imposture, ingratitude, and even insolence of some of Marie\r\nAmélie's petitioners failed to discourage her benevolence. For\r\ninstance, an old Bonapartist lady, according to M. Appert, one day\r\nwrote to her:--\r\n\r\n  MADAME,--If the Bourbons had not returned to France, for the\r\n  misfortune of the country, my beloved mistress and protectress,\r\n  the Empress Marie Louise, would still be on the throne, and\r\n  I should not be under the humiliating necessity of telling you\r\n  that I am without bread, and that the wretched bed on which I\r\n  sleep is about to be thrown out of the garret I inhabit, because\r\n  I cannot pay a year's rent. I dare not ask you for assistance,\r\n  for my heart is with my real sovereign, and I cannot promise\r\n  you my gratitude. If, however, you think fit to preserve a life\r\n  which, since the misfortunes of my country, has been full of\r\n  bitterness, I will accept a loan. I should blush to receive a\r\n  gift.\r\n\r\n  I am, Madame, your servant,                              C.\r\n\r\nWhen this impertinent letter was handed to the almoner, the queen\r\nhad written on it: \"She must be very unhappy, for she is very unjust.\r\nA hundred francs to be sent to her immediately, and I beg M. Appert\r\nto make inquiries concerning this lady's circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain the almoner remonstrated. The only effect of his remonstrance\r\nwas that the queen authorized him to make her gift 300 francs if\r\nhe found it necessary. When he knocked at the door of the garret\r\nof the petitioner, she opened it with agitation. \"Oh, Monsieur!\"\r\nshe said, \"are you the Commissioner of Police come to arrest me\r\nfor my outrageous letter to the queen? I am so unhappy that at\r\ntimes I became deranged. I am sorry to have written as I did to a\r\nprincess who to all the poor is good and charitable.\" For answer,\r\nM. Appert showed her her own letter, with the queen's memorandum\r\nwritten upon it. \"There was no lack of heartfelt gratitude then,\"\r\nhe says, \"and no lack of poverty to need the triple benefaction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nLOUIS NAPOLEON'S EARLY CAREER.--STRASBURG, BOULOGNE, HAM.\r\n\r\nThere is a theory held by some observers that the man who fails in\r\nhis duty to a woman who has claims upon his love and his protection,\r\nnever afterwards prospers; and perhaps the most striking illustration\r\nof this theory may be found in the career of the Emperor Napoleon.\r\nNothing went well with him after his divorce from Josephine. His\r\nonly son died. The children of his brothers, with the exception\r\nof Louis Napoleon, and the Prince de Canino, the son of Lucien,\r\nwere all ordinary men, inclined to the fast life of their period;\r\nwhile the descendants of Josephine, honored and respected, are\r\nnow connected with many European thrones.\r\n\r\nThe son of Napoleon, called by his grandfather, the Austrian emperor,\r\nthe Duc de Reichstadt, but by his own Bonaparte family Napoleon\r\nII., died at Vienna, July 22, 1832. The person from whom, during\r\nhis short, sad life, he had received most kindness, and to whom,\r\nduring his illness, he was indebted for almost maternal care, was\r\nthe young wife of his cousin Francis, the Princess Sophia of Bavaria,\r\nwho in the same week that he died, became the mother of Maximilian,\r\nthe unfortunate Emperor of Mexico, who, exactly thirty-five years\r\nafter, on July 22, 1867, was shot at Queretaro.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Napoleon had made a decree that if male heirs failed\r\nhim, his dynasty should be continued by the sons of his brother\r\nJoseph. Lucien, the republican, was passed over, as well as his\r\ndescendants; and Joseph failing of male heirs, the throne of France\r\nwas to devolve on Louis, king of Holland, and his heirs. Joseph\r\nleft only daughters, Zénaide and Charlotte. Louis Bonaparte when\r\nhe died, left but one son.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte was nine years younger than his brother Napoleon,\r\nwho by no right of primogeniture, but by right of success, was\r\nearly looked upon as the head of the family of Bonaparte. He assumed\r\nthe place of father to his little brother Louis, and a very\r\nunsatisfactory father he proved. Louis was studious, poetical,\r\nsolid, honorable, and unambitious. His brother was resolved to\r\nmake him a distinguished general and an able king. He succeeded\r\nin making him a brave soldier and a very good general; but Louis\r\nhad no enthusiasm for the profession of arms. He hated bloodshed,\r\nand above all he hated sack and pillage. He had no genius, and\r\ncrooked ways of any kind were abhorrent to him. When a very young\r\nman he fell passionately in love with a lady, whom he called his\r\nSophie. But his brother and the world thought the real name of\r\nthe object of his affection was Emilie de Beauharnais, the Empress\r\nJosephine's niece by marriage. This lady became afterwards the wife\r\nof M. de La Vallette, Napoleon's postmaster-general, who after\r\nthe return of the Bourbons in 1815, was condemned to death with\r\nNey and Labédoyère. His wife saved him by changing clothes with\r\nhim in prison; but the fearful strain her nerves suffered until\r\nshe was sure of his escape, unsettled her reason. She was not sent\r\nto an asylum, but lived to a great age in an _appartement_ in Paris,\r\ncarefully tended and watched over by her friends.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Jerrold's Life of Napoleon III.]\r\n\r\nBut whether it was with a Sophie or an Emilie, Louis Bonaparte fell\r\nin love, and Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of Josephine, gay,\r\nlively, poetical, and enthusiastic, had given her heart to General\r\nDuroc, the Emperor Napoleon's aide-de-camp; therefore both the young\r\npeople resisted the darling project of Napoleon and Josephine to\r\nmarry them to each other. By such a marriage Josephine hoped to\r\navert the divorce that she saw to be impending. She fancied that\r\nif sons were born to the young couple, Napoleon would be content\r\nto leave his throne to the heir of his brother Louis, whom he had\r\nadopted, and of his step-daughter, of whom he was very fond. But\r\nLouis would not marry Hortense, and Hortense would not have Louis.\r\nAt last, however, in the excitement of a ball, a reluctant consent\r\nwas wrung from Louis; then Hortense was coerced into being a good\r\nFrench girl, and giving up Duroc. She and Louis were married. A more\r\nunhappy marriage never took place. Husband and wife were separated\r\nby an insurmountable (or at least unsurmounted) incompatibility of\r\ntemperament. Louis was a man whose first thought was duty. Hortense\r\nloved only gayety and pleasure. He particularly objected to her\r\ndancing; she was one of the most graceful dancers ever seen, and\r\nwould not give it up to please him. In short, she was all graceful,\r\ncaptivating frivolity; he, rigid and exacting. Both had burning\r\nmemories in their hearts of what \"might have been,\" and above all,\r\nafter Louis became king of Holland, each took opposite political\r\nviews. Louis wanted to govern Holland as the good king of the Dutch;\r\nNapoleon expected him to govern it in the interests of his dynasty,\r\nand as a Frenchman. The brothers disagreed most bitterly. Napoleon\r\nwrote indignant, unjust letters to Louis. Hortense took Napoleon's\r\nside in the quarrel, and led a French party at the Dutch court.\r\n\r\nIntense was the grief of Louis and Hortense, Napoleon and Josephine,\r\nwhen the eldest son of this marriage, the child on whom their hopes\r\nwere set, died of the croup at an early age. Hortense was wholly\r\nprostrated by her loss. She had still one son, and was soon to\r\nhave another. The expected child was Charles Louis Napoleon, who\r\nwas to become afterwards Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nSoon after Louis Napoleon's birth, King Louis abdicated the throne\r\nof Holland. He said he could not do justice to the interests and\r\nwishes of his people, and satisfy his brother at the same time.\r\nHe retired to Florence, where he lived for many years, only once\r\nmore coming back to public life, viz., in 1814, to offer his help\r\nto his brother Napoleon, when others were deserting him.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was very fond of Hortense's little boys, though in 1811\r\nhe had completed his divorce, had married the Austrian archduchess,\r\nand had a son of his own.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon has left us some fragmentary reminiscences of his\r\nchildhood, which have a curious interest.\r\n\r\n\"My earliest recollections,\" he says, \"go back to my baptism, and I\r\nhasten to remark that I was three years old when I was baptized, in\r\n1810, in the chapel at Fontainebleau. The emperor was my godfather,\r\nand the Empress Marie Louise was my godmother. Then my memory carries\r\nme back to Malmaison. I can still see my grandmother, the Empress\r\nJosephine, in her _salon_, on the ground floor, covering me with\r\nher caresses, and, even then, flattering my vanity by the care\r\nwith which she retailed my _bons mots_; for my grandmother spoiled\r\nme in every particular, whereas my mother, from my tenderest years,\r\ntried to correct my faults and to develop my good qualities. I\r\nremember that once arrived at Malmaison, my brother and I were\r\nmasters to do as we pleased. The empress, who passionately loved\r\nflowers and conservatories, allowed us to cut her sugar-canes,\r\nthat we might suck them, and she always told us to ask for anything\r\nwe might want.\r\n\r\n\"One day, when she wished to know as usual, what we would like\r\nbest, my brother, who was three years older than I, and consequently\r\nmore full of sentiment, asked for a watch, with a portrait of our\r\nmother; but I, when the empress said: 'Louis, ask for whatever\r\nwill give you the greatest pleasure,' begged to be allowed to go\r\nout and paddle in the gutter with the little boys in the street.\r\nIndeed, until I was seven years old it was a great grief to me to\r\nhave to ride always in a carriage with four or six horses. When,\r\nin 1815, just before the arrival of the allied army in Paris, we\r\nwere hurried by our tutor to a hiding-place, and passed on foot\r\nalong the Boulevards, I felt the keenest sensations of happiness\r\nwithin my recollection. Like all children, though perhaps even\r\nmore than most children, soldiers fixed my attention. Whenever at\r\nMalmaison I could escape from the _salon_, I was off to the great\r\ngates, where there were always grenadiers of the Garde Impériale.\r\nOne day, from a ground-floor window I entered into conversation\r\nwith one of these old _grognards_ who was on duty. He answered me\r\nlaughing. I called out: 'I know my drill. I have a little musket!'\r\nThen the grenadier asked me to put him through his drill, and thus\r\nwe were found, I shouting, 'Present arms! Carry arms! Attention!'\r\nthe old grenadier obeying, to please me. Imagine my happiness! I\r\noften went with my brother to breakfast with the emperor. When\r\nhe entered the room, he would come up to us, take our heads in\r\nhis hands, and so lift us on the table. This frightened my mother\r\nvery much, Dr. Corvisart having told her that such treatment was\r\nvery bad for children.\"\r\n\r\nThe day before the Emperor Napoleon left Paris for the campaign\r\nof Waterloo, Hortense carried her boys to the Tuileries to take\r\nleave of him. Little Louis Napoleon contrived to run alone to his\r\nuncle's cabinet, where he was closeted with Marshal Soult. As soon\r\nas the boy saw the emotion in the emperor's face, he ran up to\r\nhim, and burying his head in his lap, sobbed out: \"Our governess\r\nsays you are going to the wars,--don't go; don't go, Uncle.\" \"And\r\nwhy not, Louis? I shall soon come back.\" \"Oh, Uncle, those wicked\r\nallies will kill you! Let me go with you.\" The emperor took the\r\nboy upon his knee and kissed him. Then, turning to Soult, who was\r\nmoved by the little scene, he said, \"Here, Marshal, kiss him; he\r\nwill have a tender heart and a lofty spirit; he is perhaps the\r\nhope of my race.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Waterloo, the emperor, who passed one night in Paris, kissed\r\nthe children at the last moment, with his foot upon the step of\r\nthe carriage that was to carry him the first stage of his journey\r\nto St. Helena.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Hortense and her boys were not allowed to live in France.\r\nProtected by an aide-de-camp of Prince Schwartzenberg, they reached\r\nLake Constance, on the farthest limits of Switzerland. There, after\r\na while, Queen Hortense converted a gloomy old country seat into a\r\nrefined and beautiful home. A great trial, however, awaited her.\r\nKing Louis demanded the custody of their eldest son, and little\r\nNapoleon was taken from his mother, leaving her only Louis. Louis\r\nhad always been a \"mother's boy,\" frail in health, thoughtful,\r\ngrave, loving, and full of sentiment.\r\n\r\nHortense's life at Arenenberg was varied in the winter by visits\r\nto Rome. Her husband lived in Florence, and they corresponded about\r\ntheir boys. But though they met once again in after years, they\r\nwere husband and wife no more. Indeed, charming as Hortense was to\r\nall the circle that surrounded her, tender as a mother, and devoted\r\nas a friend, her conduct as a wife was not free from reproach. She\r\nwas a coquette by nature, and it is undeniable that more than one\r\nman claimed to have been her lover.\r\n\r\nAfter a while her son Louis went for four years to college at\r\nHeidelberg. Mother and son never forget the possibilities that\r\nmight lie before them. When the Italian revolution broke out, in\r\n1832, Hortense went to Rome, both her sons being at that time in\r\nFlorence with their father. Although the elder was newly married\r\nto his cousin, the daughter of King Joseph, both he and Louis were\r\nfull of restlessness, and caught the revolutionary fervor. They\r\ncontrived to escape from their father's house and to join the\r\ninsurgents, to the great displeasure of both father and mother;\r\nbut they were fired by enthusiasm for Italian liberty, and took\r\nthe oaths as Carbonari.\r\n\r\nKing Louis and Queen Hortense were exceedingly distressed; both\r\nforesaw the hopelessness of the Italian rising. Queen Hortense went\r\nat once to Florence to consult her husband, and it was arranged that\r\nshe should go in pursuit of her sons, inducing them, if possible,\r\nto give up all connection with so hopeless a cause. But before she\r\nreached them, the insurgents, who seem to have had no fixed plan\r\nand no competent leader, had come to the conclusion that Bonapartes\r\nwere not wanted in a struggle for republicanism; they therefore\r\nrequested the young men to withdraw, and their mother went after\r\nthem to Ancona. On her way she was met by her son Louis, who was\r\ncoming to tell her that his brother was dead. There has always been\r\nmystery concerning the death of this young Napoleon. The accredited\r\naccount is that he sickened with the measles, and died at a roadside\r\ninn on his way to Ancona. The unhappy mother went into that little\r\ntown upon the Adriatic with her youngest son; but she soon found\r\nthat the Austrians, having come to the help of the Pope, were at\r\nits gates. Louis, too, had sickened with the measles. She hid him\r\nin an inner chamber, and spread a report that he had escaped to\r\nCorfu. She had with her an English passport for an English lady,\r\ntravelling to England with her two sons. She was obliged to substitute\r\na young Italian, who was compromised, for her dead son; and as\r\nsoon as Louis could rise from his bed, they set out, meeting With\r\nmany adventures until they got beyond the boundaries of Italy.\r\nUnder cover of their English passport they crossed France, and\r\nvisited the Château of Fontainebleau, where the mother pointed out\r\nto her son the scenes of his childhood.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Duc de Reichstadt in July, 1832, caused Louis\r\nNapoleon to consider himself the head of the Napoleonic family.\r\nAccording to M. Claude, the French Minister of Police, he came on\r\nthis occasion into Paris, and remained there long enough to dabble\r\nin conspiracy.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a few months in England, mother and son went back\r\nto Arenenberg, where they kept up a close correspondence with all\r\nmalcontents in France. The Legitimists preferred them the house of\r\nOrleans, and the republicans of that period--judging from their\r\nwritings as well as their acts--evidently believed that Louis Napoleon,\r\nnow head of the house of Bonaparte, represented republican principles\r\nbased on universal suffrage, as well as the glories of France.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning in October, 1836, Louis took leave of his mother\r\nat Arenenberg, telling her that he was going to visit his cousins\r\nat Baden. Stéphanie de Beauharnais in the days of the Empire had\r\nbeen married to the Grand Duke of that little country. Queen Hortense\r\nknew her son's real destination, no doubt, for she took leave of him\r\nwith great emotion, and hung around his neck a relic which Napoleon\r\nhad taken from the corpse of the Emperor Charlemagne when his tomb\r\nwas opened at Aix-la-Chapelle. It was a tiny fragment of wood,\r\nsaid to be from the True Cross, set beneath a brilliant emerald. It\r\nseems possible that this may have been the little ornament found\r\non the neck of the Prince Imperial after his corpse was stripped\r\nby savages in Zululand.\r\n\r\nWith this talisman against evil, and with the wedding-ring with\r\nwhich Napoleon had married Josephine, upon his finger, Prince Louis\r\nNapoleon set out upon an expedition so rash that we can hardly bring\r\nourselves to associate it with the character popularly ascribed\r\nto the Third Emperor Napoleon.\r\n\r\nHis plan was to overturn the government of Louis Philippe, and\r\nthen appeal to the people by a _plébiscite_,--_i. e._, a question\r\nto be answered yes or no by universal suffrage. This same plan\r\nhe carried out successfully several times during his reign.\r\n\r\nHe went from Arenenberg to Baden-Baden,[1] where he made his final\r\narrangements. Strasburg was to be the scene of his first attempt,\r\nand at Baden-Baden he had an interview with Colonel Vambéry, who\r\ncommanded the Fourth Regiment of Artillery, part of the Strasburg\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Louis Blanc, Dix Ans.]\r\n\r\nLouis Blanc, the republican and socialist historian, writing in\r\n1843, speaks thus of Louis Napoleon:--\r\n\r\n\"Brought up in exile, unfamiliar with France, Louis Bonaparte had\r\nassumed that the _bourgeoisie_ remembered only that the Empire\r\nhad curbed the Revolution, established social order, and given\r\nFrance the Code Napoléon. He fancied that the working-classes would\r\nfollow the eagle with enthusiasm the moment it appeared, borne,\r\nas of old, at the head of regiments, and heralded by the sound of\r\ntrumpets. A twofold error! The things the _bourgeoisie_ in 1836\r\nremembered most distinctly about Napoleon were his despotism and his\r\ntaste for war; and the most lasting impression of him amongst the\r\nmost intelligent in the working-classes was that whilst sowing the\r\nseeds of democratic aspiration throughout Europe, he had carefully\r\nweeded out all democratic tendencies in his own dominions.\"\r\n\r\nBut though Louis Blanc is right in saying that the evil that Napoleon\r\ndid, lived after him in the memories of thinking men, it is also\r\ntrue that those born since the fall of the Second Empire can have\r\nno idea of the general enthusiasm that still lingered in France in\r\nLouis Philippe's reign, round memories of the glories of Napoleon.\r\nMen might not wish him back again, but they worshipped him as the\r\nnational demigod. After Sedan he was pulled down literally and\r\nmetaphorically from his pedestal; and the old feelings about him\r\nwhich half a century ago even foreign nations seemed to share,\r\nnow seem obsolete and extravagant to readers of Lanfrey and the\r\nbooks of Erckmann-Chatrian.\r\n\r\nEven in 1836, when Louis Napoleon in secret entered Strasburg,\r\nhe was surprised and disappointed to find that those on whom he\r\nhad counted to assist him in making the important \"first step\" in\r\nhis career, were very doubtful of its prudence. He had counted on\r\nthe co-operation of General Voirol, an old soldier of the Empire who\r\nwas in command of the Department in which Strasburg was situated; but\r\nwhen he wrote him a letter, in the most moving terms appealing to\r\nhis affection for the emperor, the old general not only declined to\r\njoin the plot, but warned the Prefect of Strasburg that mischief was\r\non foot, though he did not mention in what quarter. The Government\r\nin Paris seems, however, to have concluded that it would be best to\r\nlet a plot so very rash come to a head. There was a public singer,\r\ncalling herself Madame Gordon, at Baden, who flung herself eagerly\r\ninto the conspiracy. Louis Napoleon on quitting Arenenberg had\r\nexpected to meet several generals of distinction, who had served\r\nunder his uncle, at a certain trysting-place between Arenenberg\r\nand Strasburg. He waited for them three days, but they never came.\r\nHe then resolved to continue his campaign without their aid or\r\nencouragement, and entered Strasburg secretly on the night of Oct.\r\n28, 1836. The next morning he had an interview with Colonel Vambéry,\r\nwho endeavored to dissuade him from his enterprise.\r\n\r\nVambéry's prudent reasons made no impression on the prince, and\r\nhe then promised his assistance. Having done so, Louis Napoleon\r\noffered him a paper, securing a pension of 10,000 francs to each\r\nof his two children, in case he should be killed. The colonel tore\r\nit up, saying, \"I give, but do not sell, my blood.\" Major Parquin,\r\nan old soldier of the Empire, who was in the garrison, had been\r\nalready won. On the night of the prince's arrival the conspirators\r\nmet at his lodging.\r\n\r\nThree regiments of infantry, three regiments of artillery, and\r\na battalion of engineers formed the garrison at Strasburg. The\r\nwisest course would have been to appeal first to the third regiment\r\nof artillery; but other counsels prevailed. The fourth artillery,\r\nwhose adhesion to the cause was doubtful, was chosen for the first\r\nattempt. All depended upon the impression made upon this regiment,\r\nwhich was the one in which Napoleon had served when captain of\r\nartillery at Toulon.\r\n\r\nThe night was spent in making preparations. Proclamations were\r\ndrawn up addressed to the soldiers, to the city, and to France;\r\nand the first step was to be the seizure of a printing-office.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock in the morning the signal was given. The soldiers\r\nof the fourth regiment of artillery were roused by the beating of the\r\n_assemblée_. They rushed, half-dressed, on to their parade-ground.\r\nLouis Napoleon, whose fate it was never to be ready, was not prompt\r\neven on this occasion; he was finishing two letters to his mother.\r\nOne was to be sent to her at once if he succeeded, the other if\r\nhe failed.\r\n\r\nOn entering the barrack-yard he found the soldiers waiting, drawn\r\nup in line. On his arrival the colonel (Vambéry) presented him to\r\nthe troops as the nephew of Napoleon. He wore an artillery uniform.\r\nA cheer rose from the line. Then Louis Napoleon, clasping a gilt\r\neagle brought to him by one of the officers, made a speech to the\r\nmen, which was well received. His cause seemed won.\r\n\r\nNext, followed by the troops, but exciting little enthusiasm in\r\nthe streets of Strasburg as he passed along them in the gray dawn\r\nof a cloudy day, Louis Napoleon made his way to the quarters of\r\nGeneral Voirol. The general emphatically refused to join the movement,\r\nand a guard was at once set over him.\r\n\r\nUp to this moment all had smiled upon the enterprise. The printing\r\nof the proclamations was going rapidly on, the third regiment of\r\nartillery was bringing out its guns and horses, and the inhabitants\r\nof Strasburg, roused from their beds, were watching the movement\r\nas spectators, prepared to assist it or to oppose it, according\r\nas it made its way to success or failure.\r\n\r\nThe prince, and the troops who supported him, next marched to the\r\nbarracks of the infantry. On their road they lost their way, and\r\napproached the barracks in such a manner that they left themselves\r\nonly a narrow alley to retreat by, in case of failure.\r\n\r\nOn the prince presenting himself to the guard, an old soldier of\r\nthe army of Napoleon kneeled and kissed his hand, when suddenly\r\none of the officers, who had his quarters in the town, rushed upon\r\nthe scene with his sword drawn, crying: \"Soldiers, you are deceived!\r\nThis man is not the nephew of the Emperor Napoleon, he is an\r\nimpostor,--a relative of Colonel Vambéry!\"\r\n\r\nThis turned the tide. Whilst the soldiers stood irresolute, the\r\ncolonel of the regiment arrived. For a few moments he was in danger\r\nfrom the adherents of the prince. His own soldiers rushed to his\r\nrescue. A tumult ensued. The little band of Imperialists was surrounded,\r\nand their cause was lost.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon yielded himself a prisoner. One or two of the\r\nconspirators, among them Madame Gordon, managed to escape; the rest\r\nwere captured.\r\n\r\nNews was at once sent by telegraph to Paris; but the great wooden-armed\r\ntelegraph-stations were in those days uncertain and unmanageable.\r\nOnly half of the telegram reached the Tuileries, where the king and\r\nhis ministers sat up all night waiting for more news. At daybreak\r\nof October 30 a courier arrived, and then they learned that the\r\nrising had been suppressed, and that the prince and his confederates\r\nwere in prison.\r\n\r\nMeantime the young officer in charge of Louis Napoleon's two letters\r\nto Queen Hortense had prematurely come to the conclusion that the\r\nprince was meeting with success, and had hurried off the letter\r\nannouncing the good news to his mother.\r\n\r\nHow to dispose of such a capture as the head of the house of Bonaparte\r\nwas a great puzzle to Louis Philippe's ministers. They dared not\r\nbring him to trial; they dared not treat him harshly. In the end\r\nhe was carried to Paris, lodged for a few days in the Conciergerie,\r\nand then sent off, without being told his destination, to Cherbourg,\r\nwhere he was put on board a French frigate which sailed with orders\r\nnot to be opened till she reached the equator. There it was found\r\nthat her destination was Rio Janeiro, where she was not to suffer\r\nthe prince to land, but after a leisurely voyage she was to put\r\nhim ashore in the United States.\r\n\r\nAs the vessel was about to put to sea, an official personage waited\r\non the prince, and after inquiring if he had funds enough to pay his\r\nexpenses on landing, handed him, on the the part of Louis Philippe,\r\na considerable sum.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Norfolk, Virginia, the prince landed, and learned, to\r\nhis very great relief, that all his fellow-conspirators had been\r\ntried before a jury at Strasburg, and acquitted!\r\n\r\nHe learned too, shortly afterwards, that his mother was very ill.\r\nThe shock of his misfortune, and the great exertions she had made\r\non his behalf when she thought his life might be in danger, had\r\nproved too much for her. Louis Napoleon recrossed the ocean, landed\r\nin England, and made his way to Arenenberg. He was just in time to\r\nsee Queen Hortense on her death-bed, to receive her last wishes,\r\nand to hear her last sigh.\r\n\r\nAfter her death the French Government insisted that the Swiss\r\nConfederacy must compel Louis Napoleon to leave their territory.\r\nThe Swiss refused, repaired the fortifications of Geneva, and made\r\nready for a war with France; but Louis Napoleon of his own free will\r\nrelieved the Swiss Government from all embarrassment by passing\r\nover into England, where it was not long before he made preparations\r\nfor a new attempt to overthrow Louis Philippe's government.\r\n\r\nHe lived quietly in London at that period, visiting few persons\r\nexcept Count D'Orsay at Gore House, the residence of Lady Blessington,\r\nand occupying himself a great deal with writing. He had already\r\ncompleted a Manual of Artillery, and was engaged on a book that\r\nhe called \"Les Idées napoléoniennes.\" Its principal \"idea\" was\r\nthat France wanted an emperor, a definite head, but that she also\r\nneeded extreme democratic principles. Therefore an empire ought to\r\nbe founded on an expression of the will of the people,--in plain\r\nwords, on universal suffrage. The mistake Napoleon III. made in\r\nhis after career, as well as in his \"Idées napoléoniennes,\" was in\r\nnot perceiving that an empire without military glory would become\r\na pool of corruption, while vast military efforts, which would\r\nembroil France with all Europe, would lose the support of the\r\n_bourgeoisie_. \"In short,\" as Louis Blanc has said, \"he imagined\r\na despotism without its triumphs; a throne surrounded by court\r\nfavorites, but without Europe at its footstool; a great name, with\r\nno great man to bear it,--the Empire, in short, _minus_ its Napoleon!\"\r\n\r\nDuring the months that Louis Napoleon passed in London he was maturing\r\nthe plot of a new enterprise. He was collecting round him his adherents,\r\nsome of them Carbonaro leaders, with whom he had been associated in\r\nItaly. Some were his personal friends; some were men whose devotion\r\nto the First Napoleon made them ashamed to refuse to support his\r\nnephew, even in an insurrection that they disapproved; while some\r\nwere mere adventurers.\r\n\r\nVery few persons were admitted to his full confidence; the affair\r\nwas managed by a clique, \"the members of which had been previously\r\nsounded; and in general those were set aside who could not embark\r\nin the undertaking heart and hand.\"\r\n\r\nBy all these men Louis Napoleon was treated as an imperial personage.\r\nTo the Italians he stood pledged, and had stood pledged since 1831,\r\nthat if they helped him to ascend the throne of France, he would\r\nfight afterwards for the cause of Italy. This pledge he redeemed\r\nat Solferino and Magenta, but not till after some impatient, rash\r\nItalians (believing him forsworn) had attempted his assassination.\r\n\r\nIn vain he was advised to wait, to let Louis Philippe's Government\r\nfall to the ground for want of a foundation. He had made his decision,\r\nand was resolved to adhere to it, not fearing to make that step\r\nwhich lies between the sublime and the ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe attempt had been in preparation ever since Louis Napoleon had\r\narrived in England. There were about forty of his adherents living\r\nin London at his expense, awaiting the moment for action. What form\r\nthat action was to take, none of them knew.[1] It was resolved to\r\nmake the movement in the month of August, 1840. The prince calculated\r\nthat the remains of his great uncle, restored by England to France,\r\nbeing by that time probably on their way from St. Helena, public\r\nenthusiasm for the great emperor would be at its height, and that\r\nhe would have the honor of receiving those revered remains when\r\nthey had been brought back from exile by Louis Philippe's son.\r\nBesides this, the garrisons of northern France happened at that\r\nmoment to contain the two regiments whose fidelity he had tampered\r\nwith at Strasburg four years before.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In this account I am largely indebted to the interesting\r\nnarrative of Count Joseph Orsi, an Italian banker, Prince Louis\r\nNapoleon's stanch personal friend.]\r\n\r\nOf course there were French agents of police (detectives, as we\r\ncall them) watching the prince in London; and this made it necessary\r\nthat he should be very circumspect in making his preparations. A\r\nsteamer, the \"Edinburgh Castle,\" was secretly engaged. The owners\r\nand the captain were informed that she was chartered by some young\r\nmen for a pleasure-trip to Hamburg.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, Aug. 4, 1840, the \"Edinburgh Castle\" came up the Thames,\r\nand was moored alongside a wharf facing the custom-house. As soon as\r\nshe was at the wharf, Count Orsi, who seems to have been the most\r\nbusiness-like man of the party, shipped nine horses, a travelling\r\ncarriage, and a large van containing seventy rifles and as many\r\nuniforms. Proclamations had been printed in advance; they were\r\nplaced in a large box, together with a little store of gold, which\r\nformed the prince's treasure.\r\n\r\nAt dawn all this was done, and the \"Edinburgh Castle\" started down\r\nthe river. At London Bridge she took in thirteen men, and at Greenwich\r\nthree more. At Blackwall some of the most important conspirators\r\ncame on board. The boat reached Gravesend about two o'clock, where\r\ntwelve more men joined them. Only three or four of those on board\r\nknew where they were going, or what was expected of them. They\r\nwere simply obeying orders.\r\n\r\nAt Gravesend the prince was to have joined his followers, and the\r\n\"Edinburgh Castle\" was at once to have put to sea, touching, however,\r\nat Ramsgate before crossing the Channel. Those on board waited\r\nand waited, but no prince came. Only five persons in the vessel\r\n(one of whom was Charles Thélin, the prince's valet) knew what\r\nthey were there for.\r\n\r\nFor some time the passengers were kept quiet by breakfast. Then,\r\nhaving no one at their head, they began to grow unruly. Those in\r\nthe secret were terribly afraid that the river police might take\r\nnotice of the large number of foreigners on board, especially as\r\nthe vessel claimed to be an excursion-boat, and not a petticoat\r\nwas visible. It was all important to catch the tide,--all important\r\nto reach Boulogne before sunrise on the 5th of August, when their\r\nfriends expected them. But no prince came.\r\n\r\nMajor Parquin, who had been one of the Strasburg conspirators, was\r\nparticularly unmanageable; and late in the afternoon he insisted\r\non going ashore to buy some cigars, saying that those on board\r\nwere detestable. In vain Persigny and Orsi, who in the prince's\r\nabsence considered themselves to be in command, assured him that to\r\nland was impossible; Parquin would not recognize their authority.\r\nThe rest of the story I will tell in Count Orsi's own words. He\r\nwrote his account in \"Fraser's Magazine,\" 1879:--\r\n\r\n\"The wrath of the major was extreme. There was danger in his anger.\r\nI consulted Persigny on the advisability of letting him go on shore,\r\nwith the distinct understanding that he should be accompanied by\r\nme or by Charles Thélin.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth, it may be suspected, was that Parquin was drunk, or\r\nthat, having suspected the object of the expedition, he had some\r\nespecial object in going ashore, which he would not reveal to his\r\nfellow-conspirators.\r\n\r\n\"Persigny,\" continues Count Orsi, \"consented to the idea, and Parquin\r\nand I got into the boat. The vessel was lying in the stream. Thélin\r\nwas with us. As we were walking to the cigar-shop, the major remarked\r\na boy sitting on a log of wood and feeding a tame eagle with shreds\r\nof meat. The eagle had a chain fastened to one of its claws. The\r\nmajor turned twice to look at it, and went on without saying a\r\nword. On our way back to the boat, however, we saw the boy within\r\ntwo yards of the landing-place. The major went up to him, and looking\r\nat the eagle, said in French, 'Is it for sale?' The boy did not\r\nunderstand him. 'My dear Major,' I said, 'I hope you do not intend\r\nto buy that eagle. We have other things to attend to. For Heaven's\r\nsake, come away!' 'Why not? I _will_ have it. Ask him what he asks\r\nfor it.'\"\r\n\r\nThe major paid a sovereign for the eagle, and this unlucky purchase\r\nwas the cause that endless ridicule was cast on the expedition. It\r\nhas always been supposed that the eagle was one of the \"properties\"\r\nprovided for the occasion, and that it was intended to perch on the\r\nNapoleon Column at Boulogne. It may well be supposed that this is\r\nnot far from the truth, and that Major Parquin had the eagle waiting\r\nfor him at Gravesend. Eagles are so very uncommon in England that\r\nit is unlikely that a boy, without set purpose, would be waiting\r\nwith a tame one on a wharf at Gravesend. The unfortunate bird became\r\nin the end the property of a butcher in Boulogne.\r\n\r\nBy six P. M. the party in the \"Edinburgh Castle\" grew very uneasy;\r\nthe prince had not arrived. Count Orsi took a post-chaise and drove\r\noverland to Ramsgate, where Count Montholon (Napoleon's fellow-exile\r\nat St. Helena) and two colonels were waiting the arrival of the\r\nsteamer. Only one of these gentlemen had been let into the plot, and\r\nMontholon was subsequently deeply wounded by having been excluded.\r\n\r\nAbout dawn, when this party had just gone to bed, the \"Edinburgh\r\nCastle\" steamed up to the beautiful Ramsgate pier; but it was already\r\nthe hour when she should have been off Boulogne.\r\n\r\nA second time Louis Napoleon had damaged his chances and risked\r\nhis friends by his want of punctuality. He had not taken proper\r\nprecautions as to his mode of leaving London. He found that the\r\npolice were on the alert, and it was late in the day before he\r\ncontrived to leave his house unseen. He might have made more exertion,\r\nbut he had quite forgotten the importance of the tide!\r\n\r\nWhat was now to be done? Four hours is the passage from Ramsgate\r\nto Boulogne. It would not do to arrive there in broad daylight.\r\nThey dared not stay at Ramsgate. It became necessary to put to\r\nsea, and to steam about aimlessly till night arrived. The captain\r\nand the crew had to be told the object of the expedition, the van\r\nhad to be opened, and the arms and uniforms distributed. This was\r\ndone after dark, and no light was allowed on board the steamer.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock A. M. of Aug. 6, 1840, the \"Edinburgh Castle\"\r\nwas off Wimereux, a little landing-place close to Boulogne. The\r\ndisembarkation was begun at once. The steamer was ill provided\r\nwith boats. She had but one, and could only land eight men at a\r\ntime. This was one of the many oversights of the expedition.\r\n\r\nAt five A. M. the little troop, clad as French soldiers, marched up\r\nto the barracks at Boulogne. The gates were thrown open by friends\r\nwithin, and the prince and his followers entered the yard. The\r\nreason why it had been so important to reach Boulogne twenty-four\r\nhours earlier, was that a certain Colonel Piguellier, who was a\r\nstrong republican, was sure to be against them. Some French friends\r\nof the prince, who were in the secret, had therefore invited Colonel\r\nPiguellier to a shooting-party on the 4th, the invitation including\r\none to pass the night at a house in the country; but by the evening\r\nof the 5th he had returned to his quarters in Boulogne.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of the prince's entrance, with his little troop,\r\ninto the yard of the barracks, the soldiers of the garrison were\r\njust getting out of their beds. The few who were already afoot\r\non different duties were soon made to understand who the prince\r\nwas, and what his party had come for. At the name of Napoleon they\r\nrushed up to the dormitories to spread the news. In a short time\r\nall the men were formed in line in the barrack-yard.\r\n\r\nThe prince, at the head of his little troop, addressed them. His\r\nspeech was received with enthusiasm. At that moment Colonel Piguellier,\r\nin full uniform, appeared upon the scene. One of the prince's party\r\nthreatened to fire on him with a revolver. His soldiers at once\r\ntook his part. It was the affair of Strasburg over again.\r\n\r\nIn vain, threats and promises were urged upon the colonel. All\r\nhe would say was: \"You may be Prince Louis Napoleon, or you may\r\nnot. Napoleon, your predecessor, overthrew legitimate authority,\r\nand it is not right for you to attempt to do the same thing in\r\nthis place. Murder me if you like, but I will do my duty to the\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers took the side of their commander. Resistance was of no\r\navail. The prince and his party were forced to leave the barracks,\r\nthe gates of which were shut at once by Colonel Piguellier's order.\r\nThe only concession the prince had been able to obtain was that\r\nhe and his followers should not be pursued by the troops, but be\r\nleft to be dealt with by the civil authorities.\r\n\r\nThe failure was complete. The day before, a party of the prince's\r\nfriends had been at Boulogne on the lookout for his arrival; but\r\nwhen they found he did not come, they had left the city. All that\r\nremained to be done was to attempt to save the prince. He was almost\r\nbeside himself. Apparently he lost his self-command, and men of\r\nmore nerve and experience did with him what they would.\r\n\r\nHe and his party reached the sea at last. The National Guard of\r\nBoulogne began firing on them. The prince, Count Persigny, Colonel\r\nVoisin, and Galvani, an Italian, were put into a boat. As they\r\npushed off, a fire of musketry shattered the little skiff, and\r\nthrew them into the water. Colonel Voisin's arm was broken at the\r\nelbow, and Galvani was hit in the body. The prince and Persigny\r\ncame up to the surface at some distance from the land. Colonel\r\nVoisin and Galvani, being nearer to the shore, were immediately\r\nrescued. Count Orsi says that as the prince swam towards the steamer,\r\nstill fired on by the National Guard stationed on the heights, a\r\ncustom-house boat headed him off. But in Boulogne it was reported\r\nand believed that he was captured and brought to land in a bathing\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were tried by a royal decree. No one was sentenced\r\nto death, but the prince, Count Montholon, Count Persigny, Colonel\r\nVoisin, Major Parquin, and another officer were sent to the fortress\r\nof Ham, on the frontier of Belgium, where they occupied the same\r\nquarters as Prince Polignac and the other ministers of Charles X.\r\nhad done. Count Montholon, four months after, made piteous appeals\r\nto be let out on parole for one day, that he might be present when\r\nthe body of Napoleon was brought back to the capital.\r\n\r\nThe prince passed five years in prison, reading much, and doubtless\r\nmeditating much on the mistakes of his career. Many plans of escape\r\nhad been secretly proposed to him, but he rejected all of them,\r\nfearing they were parts of a trap laid for him by the authorities.\r\nIt has always been believed, however, and it is probably true, that\r\nLouis Philippe would have been very willing to have the jailers\r\nshut their eyes while Louis Napoleon walked out of their custody,\r\nbelieving that the ridicule that had attended his two attempts at\r\nrevolution had ruined his chances as a pretender to the throne.\r\n\r\nDuring the years Louis Napoleon was imprisoned at Ham, he received\r\nconstant marks of sympathy, especially from foreigners. He was known\r\nto favor the project of an interoceanic canal by the Nicaragua\r\nroute between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and the Government\r\nof Nicaragua proposed to him to become president of a company that\r\nwould favor its views, expressing the hope that he would make himself\r\nas great in America by undertaking such a work, as his uncle has\r\nmade himself by his military glory.\r\n\r\nThe illness of his father in Florence gave Prince Louis Napoleon\r\na good reason for asking enlargement on parole from the French\r\nGovernment. Louis Philippe was willing to grant this; but his ministers\r\ndemurred, unless Louis Napoleon would ask pardon _loyalement_.\r\nThis Louis Napoleon refused to do; and having by this time managed\r\nto extract a loan of £6,000 from the rich and eccentric Duke of\r\nBrunswick, he resolved to attempt an escape.\r\n\r\nHere is the story as he told it himself when he reached England.\r\nThe governor of Ham, it must be premised, was a man wholly\r\nuncorruptible. He was kind to his prisoner, with whom he played\r\nwhist every evening, but he was bent on fulfilling his duty.\r\n\r\nThis duty obliged him to See the prince twice a day, and at night\r\nto turn the key upon him, which he put into his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe fortress of Ham forms a square, with a round tower at each of\r\nthe angles. There is only one gate. Between the towers are ramparts,\r\non one of which the prince daily walked, and in one corner had made\r\na flower-garden. A canal ran outside the ramparts on two sides;\r\nbarracks were under the others. Thélin, the prince's valet, was\r\nsuffered to go in and out of the fortress at his pleasure. On the\r\n23d of May, 1845, Thélin went to St. Quentin, the nearest large\r\ntown, and hired a cabriolet, which was to meet him the next day at\r\nan appointed place upon the high-road. The prince's plan depended\r\non there being workmen in the prison, and he had been about to\r\nmake a request to have his rooms papered and painted, when the\r\ngovernor informed him that the staircase was to be repaired. The\r\nday before the one chosen for the attempt, two English gentlemen,\r\nprobably by a previous understanding, had visited the prisoner,\r\nand he asked one of them to lend his passport to the valet Thélin.\r\n\r\n\"Very early on the morning of May 25th, the prince, Dr. Conneau,\r\nand Thélin were looking out eagerly for the arrival of the workmen.\r\nA private soldier whose vigilance they had reason to dread had\r\nbeen placed on guard that morning, but by good luck he was called\r\naway to attend a dress parade.\r\n\r\n\"The workmen arrived. They proved to be all painters and masons,--which\r\nwas a disappointment to the prince, who had hoped to go out as\r\na carpenter. But at once he shaved off his long moustache, and\r\nput over his own clothes a coarse shirt, a workman's blouse, a\r\npair of blue overalls much worn, and a black wig. His hands and\r\nface he also soiled with paint; then, putting on a pair of wooden\r\nshoes and taking an old clay pipe in his mouth, and throwing a\r\nboard over his shoulder, he prepared to leave the prison. He had\r\nwith him a dagger, and two letters from which he never parted,--one\r\nwritten by his mother, the other by his uncle, the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"It was seven o'clock by the time these preparations were made.\r\nThélin called to the workmen on the staircase to come in and have\r\na glass of wine. On the prince's way downstairs he met two warders.\r\nOne Thélin skilfully drew apart, pretending to have something to\r\nsay to him; the other was so intent on getting out of the way of\r\nthe board carried by the supposed workman that he did not look in\r\nthe prince's face, and the prince and Thélin passed safely into\r\nthe yard.\"\r\n\r\nAs he was passing the first sentinel, the prince let his pipe fall\r\nfrom his mouth. He stooped, picked it up, and re-lighted it\r\ndeliberately.\r\n\r\n\"Close to the door of the canteen he came upon an officer reading\r\na letter. A little farther on, a few privates were sitting on a\r\nbench in the sun. The concierge at the gate was in his lodge, but\r\nhis attention was given to Thélin, who was following the prince,\r\naccompanied by his dog Ham. The sergeant, whose duty it was to\r\nopen and shut the gate, turned quickly and looked at the supposed\r\nworkman; but a movement the prince made at that moment with his\r\nboard caused him to step aside. He opened the gate: the prince\r\nwas free.\r\n\r\n\"Between the two drawbridges the prince met two workmen coming\r\ntowards him on the side his face was exposed. He shifted his board\r\nlike a man weary of carrying a load upon one shoulder. The men\r\nappeared to eye him with suspicion, as if surprised at not knowing\r\nhim. Suddenly one said: 'Oh! it is Berthon;' and they passed on\r\ninto the fortress.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince hastened with Thélin to the place where the cabriolet\r\nengaged the day before was waiting for them. As Louis Napoleon\r\nwas about to fling away the board he had been carrying, another\r\ncabriolet drove by. As soon as it was out of sight, the prince\r\njumped into his own, shook the dust off his clothes, kicked off\r\nhis wooden shoes, and seized the reins. The fifteen miles to St.\r\nQuentin were soon accomplished. The prince got out at some distance\r\nfrom the town, and Thélin entered it alone, to exchange the cabriolet\r\nfor a postchaise. The mistress of the post-house offered him a\r\nlarge piece of pie, which he thankfully accepted, knowing that it\r\nwould be a godsend to his master. A woman, whom they had passed\r\nupon the highway on entering the town, took Thélin aside and asked\r\nhim how he came to be driving with such a shabby, common man that\r\nmorning; for Thélin was well known in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nBefore he rejoined the prince with the pie and the postchaise, Louis\r\nNapoleon had become very impatient. Seeing a carriage approach,\r\nhe stopped it, and asked the occupant if he had seen anything of a\r\npostchaise coming from St. Quentin. The traveller proved afterwards\r\nto have been the prosecuting attorney of the district (_le procureur\r\ndu roi_).\r\n\r\nIt was nine in the evening when the prince, Thélin, and the dog\r\nHam were safely in the carriage. They reached Valenciennes at a\r\nquarter to three A. M., and had to wait more than an hour at the\r\nstation for the train. The prince had discarded his working clothes,\r\nbut still wore his black wig. The train arrived at last. By help of\r\nthe Englishman's passport the prince safely crossed the frontier,\r\nand soon reached Brussels. Thence he went by way of Ostend to London.\r\n\r\nHe was not in time to see his father, who died in Florence before he\r\ncould get permission from the German States to cross the continent.\r\n\r\nAll the French papers treated his escape as a matter of no consequence.\r\nImmediately on reaching London, he wrote a letter to Louis Philippe,\r\npledging himself to make no further attempt to disturb the peace\r\nof France during his reign. He probably judged that the end of\r\nthe Orleans dynasty might be near.\r\n\r\nHis escape from prison was not known until the evening. Dr. Conneau\r\ngave out that he had been very ill during the night, but under the\r\ninfluence of opiates was sleeping quietly. The governor insisted\r\non remaining all day in the sitting-room, and finally upon seeing\r\nhim. In the dim light of the sick chamber he saw only a figure,\r\nwith its face turned to the wall, covered up in the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\nAt last he became suspicious. Thélin's prolonged absence seemed\r\nunaccountable. A closer examination was insisted on, and the truth\r\nwas discovered. Nobody was punished except Dr. Conneau, who suffered\r\na few months' imprisonment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _LOUIS PHILLIPE_. (\"_The Citizen-King._\")]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTEN YEARS OF THE REIGN OF THE CITIZEN KING.\r\n\r\nBesides the affairs of the Duchesse de Berri, of Louis Napoleon,\r\nof Fieschi and his infernal machine, and difficulties attending\r\non the marriage of the Duke of Orleans, the first ten years of\r\nLouis Philippe's reign were full of vicissitudes. France after a\r\nrevolution is always an \"unquiet sea that cannot rest, whose waters\r\ncast up mire and dirt.\" Frenchmen do not accept the inevitable\r\nas Americans have learned to do, through the working of their\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nOne of the early troubles of Louis Philippe was the peremptory\r\ndemand of President Jackson for five million dollars,--a claim\r\nfor French spoliations in 1797. This amount had been acknowledged\r\nby the Government of Louis Philippe to be due, but the Chambers\r\nwere not willing to ratify the agreement. In the course of the\r\nnegotiations the secretary of General Jackson, having occasion to\r\ntranslate to him a French despatch, read, \"The French Government\r\n_demands_--\" \"Demands!\" cried the general, with a volley of rough\r\nlanguage; \"if the French Government dares to _demand_ anything\r\nof the United States, it will not get it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was long before he could be made to understand the true meaning\r\nof the French word _demande_, and his own demands were backed with\r\nthreats and couched in terms more forcible than diplomatic. The\r\nmoney was paid after the draft of the United States for the first\r\ninstalment had been protested, and France has not yet forgotten that\r\nwhen she was still in the troubled waters of a recent revolution,\r\nshe was roughly treated by the nation which she had befriended at\r\nits birth.\r\n\r\nThe greatest military success in Louis Philippe's reign was the\r\ncapture of Constantine in Algeria. So late as 1810 Algerine corsairs\r\nwere a terror in the Mediterranean, and captured M. Arago, who was\r\nemployed on a scientific expedition.[1] In 1835, France resolved\r\nto undertake a crusade against these pirates, which might free the\r\ncommerce of the Mediterranean. The enterprise was not popular in\r\nFrance. It would cost money, and it seemed to present no material\r\nadvantages. It was argued that its benefits would accrue only to\r\nthe dynasty of Louis Philippe, that Algeria would be a good\r\ntraining-school for the army, and that the main duty of the army\r\nin future might be to repress republicanism.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: About the same time they took prisoner a cousin of\r\nmy father, John Warner Wormeley, of Virginia. He was sold into\r\nslavery; but when tidings of his condition reached his friends,\r\nhe was ransomed by my grandfather.]\r\n\r\nIn 1834, a young Arab chief called Abdul Kader, the son of a Marabout\r\nof great sanctity, had risen into notice. Abdul Kader was a man\r\nwho realized the picture of Saladin drawn by Sir Walter Scott in\r\nthe \"Talisman.\" Brave, honorable, chivalrous, and patriotic, his\r\nenemies admired him, his followers adored him. When he made his\r\nfirst treaty with the French, he answered some doubts that were\r\nexpressed concerning his sincerity by saying gravely: \"My word\r\nis sacred; I have visited the tomb of the Prophet.\"\r\n\r\nConstantine, the mountain fortress of Oran, was held, not by Abdul\r\nKader, but by Ahmed Bey, the representative of the sultan's suzerainty\r\nin the Barbary States. The first attack upon it failed. The weather\r\nand the elements fought against the French in this expedition.\r\nGeneral Changarnier distinguished himself in their retreat, and\r\nthe Duc de Nemours showed endurance and bravery.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of that repulse, popular enthusiasm was aroused.\r\nA cry rang through France that Constantine must be taken. It was\r\ncaptured two years later, after a siege in which two French\r\ncommanders-in-chief and many generals were killed. Walls fell,\r\nand mines exploded; the place at last was carried by assault. At\r\none moment, when even French soldiers wavered, a legion of foreign\r\ndare-devils (chiefly Irishmen and Englishmen) were roused by an English\r\nhurrah from the man who became afterwards Marshal Saint-Arnaud. With\r\nechoing cheers they followed him up the breach, the army followed\r\nafter them, and the city was won.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe had been raised to power by four great men,--Lafayette,\r\nLaffitte, Talleyrand, and Thiers. Of these, Laffitte and Lafayette\r\nretained little influence in his councils, and both died early\r\nin his reign. In 1838 died Talleyrand,--the prince of the old\r\ndiplomatists. The king and his sister, Madame Adélaïde, visited\r\nhim upon his death-bed. Talleyrand, supported by his secretary,\r\nsat up to receive the king. He was wrapped in a warm dressing-gown,\r\nwith the white curls he had always cherished, flowing over his\r\nshoulders, while the king sat near him, dressed in his claret-colored\r\ncoat, brown wig, and varnished boots. Some one who was present\r\nwhispered that it was an interview between the last of the _ancienne\r\nnoblesse_ and the first citizen _bourgeois_. Rut the old courtier\r\nwas touched by the intended kindness, and when the king was about\r\nto go away, he said, half rising: \"Sire, this honor to my house\r\nwill be gratefully remembered in the annals of my family.\"\r\n\r\nDeep and true was the grief felt for the loss of Talleyrand in\r\nhis own household; many and bitter have been the things said of\r\nhis character and his career. He himself summed up his life in some\r\nwords written shortly before his death, which read like another\r\nverse in the Book of Ecclesiastes:--\r\n\r\n\"Eighty-three years have rolled away! How many cares, how many\r\nanxieties! How many hatreds have I inspired, how many exasperating\r\ncomplications have I known! And all this with no other result than\r\ngreat moral and physical exhaustion, and a deep feeling of\r\ndiscouragement as to what may happen in the future,--disgust, too,\r\nas I think over the past.\"\r\n\r\nA writer in \"Temple Bar\" (probably Dr. Jevons) speaks of Prince\r\nTalleyrand thus:--\r\n\r\n\"On his private life it would be unfair to pass judgment without\r\ntaking into consideration the turbulence and lawlessness, the immorality\r\nand corruption both social and political, which characterized the\r\nstormy epoch in which he was called to play a very prominent part.\r\nIf he did not pass through it blameless, he was less guilty than\r\nmany others; if his hands were not pure, at least they were not\r\nblood-stained; and it is possible that, as Bourienne, who knew\r\nhim well, says: 'History will speak as favorably of him as his\r\ncontemporaries have spoken ill.'\"\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1840 seemed peaceful and serene, when a storm burst\r\nsuddenly out of a cloudless sky. It was a new phase of that Eastern\r\nQuestion which unhappily was not settled in the days of the Crusades,\r\nbut has survived to be a disturbing element in the nineteenth century.\r\nTwo men were engaged in a fierce struggle in the East, and, as usual,\r\nthey drew the Powers of the West and North into their quarrel.\r\n\r\nSultan Mahmoud, who had come to the throne in 1808, had done his\r\nbest to destroy the power of his pashas. He hated such powerful and\r\ninsubordinate nobles, and after the destruction of the Mamelukes\r\nin 1811, he placed Egypt under the rule of the bold Macedonian\r\nsoldier, Mehemet Ali, not as a pasha, but as viceroy. In course\r\nof time, as the dominions of Sultan Mahmoud became more and more\r\ndisorganized by misgovernment and insurrection, Mehemet Ali sent\r\nhis adopted son, Ibrahim Pasha, with an army into Syria. Ibrahim\r\nconquered that province and governed it far better than the Turks\r\nhad done, when he was stopped by a Russian army (1832), which,\r\nunder pretence of assisting the sultan, interfered in the quarrel.\r\nAn arrangement was effected by what is called the treaty of\r\nUnkiar-Thelessi. Ibrahim was to retain the pashalik of Syria for\r\nhis life, and Russia stipulated that no vessels of war should be\r\nallowed to pass the Dardanelles or Hellespont without the consent\r\nof the sultan.\r\n\r\nMehemet Ali, who was anxious above all things to have his viceroyalty\r\nin Egypt made hereditary, that he might transmit his honors to his\r\nbrave son, cast about in every direction to find friends among\r\nEuropean diplomatists. Six years before, he had proposed to England,\r\nFrance, and Austria a partition of the sultan's empire. \"Russia,\"\r\nhe said, \"is half mistress of Turkey already. She has established\r\na protectorate over half its subjects, who are Greek Christians,\r\nand where she professes to protect, she oppresses instead. If she\r\nseizes Constantinople, there is the end of your European civilization.\r\nI am a Turk, but I propose to you to inaugurate a crusade which\r\nwill save Turkey and save Europe. I will raise my standard against\r\nthe czar; I will put at your disposal my army, fleet, and treasure;\r\nI will lead the van; and in return I ask only my independence of\r\nthe Porte and an acknowledgment of me as an hereditary sovereign.\"\r\nThis proposition was promptly declined. It was renewed, in 1838,\r\nin a modified form, but again England, France, and Austria would\r\nnot listen to the viceroy's reasoning. Mehemet Ali became a prey\r\nto despair.\r\n\r\nSultan Mahmoud meantime was no less a victim to resentment and\r\nanxiety. He hated his enforced subservience to Russia, and above\r\nall he hated his great subject and rival, Mehemet Ali. With fury\r\nin his heart he watched how, shred by shred, his great empire was\r\nwrenched away from him,--Greece, Syria, Servia, Algiers, Moldavia,\r\nand Wallachia. Little remained to him but Constantinople and its\r\nsurrounding provinces. Russia, all-powerful in the Black Sea, could\r\nat any moment force him to give up to her the key of the Dardanelles.\r\nAmong the Turks (the only part of his subjects on whom he could rely)\r\nwere many malcontents. Fanatic dervishes predicted his overthrow,\r\nand called him the Giaour Sultan. He had destroyed Turkish customs,\r\noutraged Turkish feelings, and by the massacre o the Janissaries,\r\nin 1826, he had sapped Turkish strength. He now began in his own\r\nperson to set at nought the precepts of the Koran. All day he worked\r\nwith frenzy, and at night he indulged himself in frightful orgies,\r\ntill, dead drunk, he desisted from his madness, and was carried\r\nby his slaves to his bed.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Louis Blanc, Dix Ans.]\r\n\r\nIn the early months of 1839 Mahmoud made quiet preparations to\r\nthrust Ibrahim Pasha out of Syria; and in June a great battle was\r\nfought between the Egyptians and the Turks on the banks of the\r\nEuphrates, in which Ibrahim Pasha, by superior generalship, wholly\r\ndefeated the Turkish commander, Hafiz Pasha.\r\n\r\nSultan Mahmoud never heard of this disaster. He died of _delirium\r\ntremens_ the very week that it took place, and his son, Abdul Medjid,\r\nmounted his throne. Ibrahim Pasha immediately after his victory\r\nhad made ready to threaten Constantinople, when despatches from\r\nhis father arrested him. Mehemet wrote that France had promised\r\nto take the part of Egypt, and to settle all her difficulties by\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\nMeantime the new sultan, or his vizier, having offended the Capitan\r\nPasha (or Admiral of the Fleet), that officer thought proper to\r\ncarry the ships under his command over to Mehemet Ali.\r\n\r\nIt was a proud day for the viceroy when the Turkish ships sailed\r\ninto the harbor of Alexandria. This defection of the fleet so\r\ndiscouraged Abdul Medjid that he offered his vassal terms of peace,\r\nby which he consented to Mehemet's hereditary viceroyalty in Egypt,\r\nand Ibrahim Pasha's hereditary possession of the pashalik of Syria.\r\n\r\nBut the Great Powers would not consent to this dismemberment of the\r\nTurkish Empire. A fierce struggle in diplomacy took place between\r\nFrance and England, which might have resulted in an open rupture,\r\nhad not Louis Philippe and Marshal Soult (then Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs in France) been both averse to war. The old marshal had\r\nseen more than enough of it, and Louis Philippe felt that peace\r\nalone could strengthen his party,--the _bourgeoisie_. Mehemet Ali,\r\nhis rights and his wrongs, seem to have been entirely overlooked\r\nin the tempest of diplomacy.\r\n\r\nAfter some weeks of great excitement the Five Great Powers agreed\r\namong themselves that Mehemet Ali should become the Khedive, or\r\nhereditary viceroy, of Egypt, but that he must give up Syria. To\r\nthis he demurred, and the allied troops attacked Ibrahim Pasha.\r\nAdmiral Sir Charles Napier bombarded his stronghold, St. Jean d'Acre,\r\nand forced him into submission. The triumph of Lord Palmerston's\r\npolicy was complete; as Charles Greville remarked: \"Everything\r\nhas turned out well for him. He is justified by the success of\r\nhis operations, and by the revelations in the French Chambers of\r\nthe intentions of M. Thiers; and it must be acknowledged he has\r\na fair right to plume himself on his diplomacy.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Talleyrand, only M. Thiers remained of the four\r\ngreat men who had assisted Louis Philippe to attain supreme power.\r\nM. Thiers was not insensible to the advantage it would be to his\r\nHistory of the Consulate and Empire, if he could add to it a last\r\nand brilliant chapter describing the restoration to France of the\r\nmortal remains of her great emperor. Therefore in the early part\r\nof 1840, before any disturbance of the _entente cordiale_, he made\r\na request to the English Government for the body of Napoleon, then\r\nlying beneath a willow-tree at Longwood, on a desolate island that\r\nhardly seemed to be part of the civilized world. Lord Palmerston\r\nresponded very cordially, and Louis Philippe's third son, the Prince\r\nde Joinville, in his frigate, the \"Belle Poule,\" attended by other\r\nFrench war-ships, was despatched upon the errand. Napoleon had died\r\nMay 5, 1821. For almost twenty years his body had reposed at St.\r\nHelena. With the Prince de Joinville went Bertrand and Gourgaud,\r\nwho had been the Emperor's companions in captivity.\r\n\r\nThe coffin was raised and opened. The face was perfect. The beard,\r\nwhich had been shaved before the burial, had apparently a week's\r\ngrowth. The white satin which had lined the lid of the coffin had\r\ncrumbled into dust, and lay like a mist over the body, which was\r\ndressed in a green uniform, with the cocked hat across its knees.\r\n\r\nThe corpse was transferred to another coffin brought from France, and\r\nwas carried over the rough rocks of St. Helena by English soldiers.\r\nAll the honors that in that remote island England could give to her\r\nformer captive were respectfully offered; and early in December,\r\n1840, news arrived in Paris that the \"Belle Poule\" had reached\r\nHavre.\r\n\r\nThis was sooner than her arrival had been looked for, and at once\r\nall Paris was in a scramble of preparation. Laborers and artists\r\nworked night and day. The weather was piercingly cold. Indeed, no\r\nless than three hundred English were said to have died of colds\r\ncontracted on the day of the funeral procession.\r\n\r\nThe body was landed at Courbevoie from a flat-bottomed barge that\r\nhad been constructed to bring it up the Seine. Courbevoie is about\r\ntwo miles from the Arch of Triumph, which is again nearly the same\r\ndistance from the Place de la Concorde.\r\n\r\nBetween each gilded lamp-post, with its double burners, and beneath\r\nlong rows of leafless trees, were colossal plaster statues of Victory,\r\nalternating with colossal vases burning incense by day, and inflammable\r\nmaterials for illumination by night. Thus the procession attending the\r\nbody had about five miles to march from the place of disembarkation\r\nto the Invalides, on the left bank of the Seine. The spectators began\r\nto assemble before dawn. All along the route scaffoldings had been\r\nerected, containing rows upon rows of seats. All the trees, bare and\r\nleafless at that season, were filled with freezing _gamins_. All\r\nthe wide pavements were occupied. Before long, rows of National\r\nGuards fringed the whole avenue. They were to fall in behind the\r\nprocession as it passed, and accompany it to the Invalides.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the funeral barge had been retarded while the authorities\r\nhastened the preparations for its reception. When the body of Napoleon\r\nwas about to re-land on French soil, \"cannon to right of it, cannon\r\nto left of it, volleyed and thundered.\" The coffin was received\r\nbeneath what was called a votive monument,--a column one hundred\r\nfeet in height, with an immense gilded globe upon the top, surmounted\r\nby a gilded eagle twenty feet high. Banners and tripods were there\r\n_ad libitum_, and a vast plaster bas-relief cast in the \"Belle\r\nPoule's\" honor.\r\n\r\nThe coffin, having been landed, was placed upon a catafalque, the\r\ncannon gave the signal to begin the march, and the procession started.\r\nThe public was given to understand that in a sort of funeral casket\r\nblazing with gold and purple, on the top of the catafalque, twenty\r\nfeet from the ground, was enclosed the coffin of the Emperor; but\r\nit was not so. The sailors of the \"Belle Poule\" protested that the\r\ncatafalque was too frail, and the height too great. They dared\r\nnot, they said, attempt to get the lead-lined coffin up to the\r\nplace assigned for it, still less try to get it down again. It was\r\nconsequently deposited, for fear of accident, on a low platform\r\nbetween the wheels.\r\n\r\nFirst came the gendarmes, or mounted police, with glittering brazen\r\nbreastplates, waving horse-hair crests, fine horses, and a band\r\nof trumpeters; then the mounted Garde Municipale; then Lancers;\r\nthen the Lieutenant-General commanding the National Guard of Paris,\r\nsurrounded by his staff, and all officers, of whatever grade, then\r\non leave in the capital. These were followed by infantry, cavalry,\r\nsappers and miners, Lancers, and Cuirassiers, staff-officers, etc.,\r\nwith bands and banners. Then came a carriage containing the chaplain\r\nwho had had charge of the body from the time it left St. Helena,\r\nfollowing whom were a crowd of military and naval officers. Next\r\nappeared a led charger, son of a stallion ridden by Napoleon, and\r\nsoon after came a bevy of the marshals of France. Then all the\r\nbanners of the eighty-six departments, and at last the funeral\r\ncatafalque.\r\n\r\nAs it passed under the Arch of Triumph, erected by Napoleon in\r\ncommemoration of his victories, there were hundreds in the crowd\r\nwho expected to see the Emperor come to life again.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the universal cry was \"Vive l'empereur!\" One heard\r\nnowhere \"Vive le roi!\"\r\n\r\nThe funeral car was hung with purple gauze embroidered with golden\r\nbees. As I said, the coffin of the Emperor was suffered to repose\r\nupon a gilded buckler supported by four golden caryatides; but it\r\nwas, as the sailors would have said, \"stowed safely in the hold.\"\r\n\r\nThe catafalque was hung all over with wreaths, emblems, and banners.\r\nIt had solid gilded wheels, and was drawn by eight horses covered\r\nwith green velvet, embroidered with gold bees; each horse was led\r\nby a groom in the Bonaparte livery. At the four corners of the car,\r\nholding the tassels of the pall, rode two marshals, an admiral,\r\nand General Bertrand, who had shared the captivity of the Emperor.\r\nCount Montholon was not suffered to leave his imprisonment for the\r\noccasion, though he also had been a companion of the Emperor at\r\nSt. Helena. Around the catafalque marched the five hundred sailors\r\nof the \"Belle Poule,\" headed by their captain, the Prince de\r\nJoinville,--slender, tall, and dark, a very naval-looking man.\r\nHe was supposed to be intensely hostile to England, and only to\r\nbe kept in check by a strong hand. Then came all the Emperor's\r\naides-de-camp who were still living, and all the aged veterans in\r\nParis who had served under him. This was the most touching feature\r\nof the procession. Many tears were shed by the spectators, and a\r\nthrill ran through the hearts of eight hundred thousand people as\r\nthe catafalque creaked onward, passing under the arch which celebrated\r\nNapoleon's triumphs, and beneath which at other times no carriage\r\nwas allowed to pass. But enthusiasm rose to the highest point at the\r\nsight of the veterans in every kind of faded uniform,--Grenadiers\r\nof the Guard, Chasseurs, Dragoons of the Empress, Red Lancers,\r\nMamelukes, Poles, and, above all, the Old Guard. \"Vive la Vieille\r\nGarde!\" shouted the multitude; \"Vive les Polonais! Vive l'empereur!\"\r\n\r\nThe funeral was a political blunder. It stirred up the embers of\r\nNapoleonism. Ten years later they blazed into a consuming fire.\r\n\r\nThe procession passed through the Place de la Concorde, beneath\r\nthe shadow of the obelisk of Luxor, which of old had looked on\r\ntriumphs and funeral processions in Egypt; then it crossed the\r\nSeine. On the bridge were eight colossal statues, representing\r\nprudence, strength, justice, war, agriculture, art commerce, and\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nThe statues along the Champs Elysées were Victories, each inscribed\r\nwith the name of some Napoleonic battle. Great haste had been required\r\nto get them ready. At the last moment Government had had to order\r\nfrom certain manufactories pairs of wings by the dozen, and bucklers\r\nand spears in the same way. All night the artists had been fixing\r\nthese emblems on their statues. A statue of Marshal Ney, which\r\nhad been ordered among those of the other marshals, was found to\r\nbe, not of colossal, but of life size. It had to be hurriedly cut\r\ninto three parts. The deficiency in the torso was concealed by\r\nflags, and the \"bravest of the brave\" took his place on a par with\r\nhis comrades.\r\n\r\nOn the steps of the Chamber of Deputies was a colossal statue of\r\nImmortality, designed for the top of the Pantheon, but pressed\r\ninto service on this occasion, holding forth a gilded crown as if\r\nabout to place it on the coffin of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nAt the gate of the Invalides was another genuine statue, Napoleon\r\nin his imperial robes was holding forth the cordon of the Legion\r\nof Honor. This statue had been executed for the Pillar at Boulogne\r\ncommemorative of the Army of England. It was surrounded by plaster\r\nstatues of the departments of France, and was approached through a\r\nlong line of marshals, statesmen, and the most illustrious of French\r\nkings, among them Louis XIV., who would have been much astonished to\r\nfind himself rendering homage to a soldier of barely gentlemanly\r\nbirth, born on an island which was not French in his time.\r\n\r\nThe coffin was borne by sailors into the Chapelle Ardente at the\r\nInvalides. \"Sire,\" said Prince de Joinville to his father, \"I present\r\nto you the body of the Emperor Napoleon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I receive it in the name of France,\" replied the king.\r\n\r\nThen Marshal Soult put the Emperor's sword into the king's hand.\r\n\"General Bertrand,\" said the king, \"I charge you to lay it on the\r\ncoffin of the Emperor. General Gourgaud, place the Emperor's hat\r\nalso on the coffin.\"\r\n\r\nThen began the appropriate religious ceremonies, and during the\r\nfollowing week the public were admitted to view the coffin as it\r\nlay in state in the Chapelle Ardente. The crowd was very great.\r\nWomen fainted daily, and many were almost pressed to death against\r\nthe gilded rails.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there was little to see. The coffin was enclosed in a\r\nsort of immense cage to keep it from intrusion, the air was heavy\r\nwith incense, and the light was too dimly religious to show anything\r\nwith distinctness.\r\n\r\nA splendid tomb has since been erected to Napoleon in the Chapel\r\nof the Invalides, where he rests under the care of the war-worn\r\nsoldiers of France. Few now can be living who fought under him.\r\nNot a Bonaparte was at his funeral; the only one then upon French\r\nsoil was in a prison.\r\n\r\nNapoleon sleeps where in his will he prayed that his remains might\r\nrest,--on the banks of the Seine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSOME CAUSES OF THE REVOLUTION OF 1848.\r\n\r\nAfter the signing of the treaty of 1841, which restored the _entente\r\ncordiale_ between France and England, and satisfied the other European\r\nPowers, Louis Philippe and his family were probably in the plenitude\r\nof their prosperity. The Duke of Orleans had been happily married;\r\nand although his wife was a Protestant,--which was not wholly\r\nsatisfactory to Queen Marie Amélie,--the character of the Duchesse\r\nHélène was so lovely that she won all hearts, both in her husband's\r\nfamily and among the people.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the _fêtes_ given in Paris at the nuptials of\r\nthe Duke of Orleans, in 1837, the sad presage of misfortune that\r\nhad accompanied the marriage festivities of Marie Antoinette was\r\nrepeated. One of the spectacles given to the Parisians was a sham\r\nattack on a sham citadel of Antwerp in the Champ de Mars. The crowd\r\nwas immense, but all went well so long as the spectacle lasted.\r\nWhen the crowd began to move away, a panic took place. The old and\r\nthe feeble were thrown down and trampled on. Twenty-four persons\r\nwere killed, the _fêtes_ were broken up, and all hearts were saddened\r\nboth by the disaster and the omen.\r\n\r\nOne part of the festivities on that occasion consisted in the opening\r\nof the galleries of historical paintings at Versailles,--a magnificent\r\ngift made by the Citizen King to his people.\r\n\r\nI have spoken already of the storming of Constantine. No French\r\nsuccess since the wars of the Great Napoleon had been so brilliant;\r\nyet the Chamber of Deputies, in a fit of parsimony, reduced from\r\ntwo thousand to eleven hundred dollars the pension proposed by\r\nthe ministers to be settled on the widow of General Damremont,\r\nthe commander-in-chief, who had been killed by a round shot while\r\ngiving orders to scale the walls. At the same time they voted two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand dollars for the year's subsidy to the\r\ntheatres of Paris for the amusement of themselves and their\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nAlgeria proved a valuable school for soldiers; there Lamoricière,\r\nChangarnier, Cavaignac, Saint-Arnaud, Pélissier, and Bugeaud had\r\ntheir military education. Louis Philippe's three sons were also\r\nwith the troops, sharing all the duties, dangers, and hardships\r\nof the campaign.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1847 Abdul Kader had retired to a stronghold in the\r\nmountains, where, seeing that his cause was lost, he tendered his\r\nsubmission to the Duc d'Aumale, then governor of Algeria. The offer\r\nwas accepted. Abdul Kader surrendered on an understanding that he\r\nshould be conducted to some Mohammedan place of refuge,--Alexandria\r\nor St. Jean d'Acre. But this stipulation was disregarded by the\r\nFrench Government, whose breach of faith has always been considered\r\na stain on the honor of Louis Philippe and his ministers. The Duc\r\nd'Aumale vehemently remonstrated, believing his own word pledged\r\nto the Arab chieftain. Abdul Kader, his wives, children, servants,\r\nand principal officers were taken to France, and for five years\r\nlived at Amboise, where some of the subordinate attendants, overcome\r\nby homesickness, committed suicide. In 1852 Louis Napoleon, who\r\npossibly had a fellow-feeling for captives, restored Abdul Kader to\r\nliberty, who thereupon took up his residence at Damascus. There he\r\nsubsequently protected a large number of Christians from massacre,\r\nsheltering them in his house, and giving them food and clothing. He\r\nafterwards removed to the island of Ceylon, where, as everywhere\r\nelse, he won \"golden opinions\" by his generous behavior.\r\n\r\nMeantime, while France was in some respects in the full tide of\r\nprosperity, great discontent was growing up among the working-classes,\r\nreinforced by the worthless class, always ready for disturbances. In\r\nMay, 1839, Barbès led an _émeute_ in Paris which might have proved\r\nformidable. His attempt opened with a deliberate murder, and there\r\nwas considerable fighting in the streets for about twenty-four\r\nhours. Barbès was condemned to death. The king was desirous to\r\nspare him, and yielded readily to the prayers of his sister, for\r\nwhom an opportunity of interceding for him was obtained by the\r\ngood offices of Lamartine.\r\n\r\nThe _émeute_ of Barbès was regarded with disfavor by more experienced\r\nconspirators, but secret societies had introduced organization\r\namong the workmen. Moreover, they were led by the _bourgeoisie_\r\nwith a cry for parliamentary reform, which at that period was the\r\nsupposed panacea for every kind of evil.\r\n\r\nThe king was not popular. He was not the ideal Frenchman. He was\r\na Frenchman of the _épicier_, or small grocer, type. As a _bon\r\npère de famille_ he was anxious to settle his sons well in life.\r\nThey were admirable young men, they deserved good wives, and as\r\nfar as grace, beauty, and amiability went, they all obtained them;\r\nbut up to 1846 not one of them had made a brilliant marriage. This\r\ngood fortune Louis Philippe hoped was reserved for his two younger\r\nsons,--D'Aumale and Montpensier.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Orleans was the most popular of the king's sons. Handsome,\r\nelegant, accomplished, and always careful in his toilet, he was a\r\nthorough Frenchman,--the approved type of an aristocrat with liberal\r\nsympathies and ideas. He was born at Palermo in 1810, and did not\r\ncome to France till he was four years old. He had an excellent\r\ntutor, who prepared him for his _collège_. There he took his place\r\nentirely on a par with other boys, and gained several prizes. All\r\nLouis Philippe's sons were sent to public schools.\r\n\r\nThe duke afterwards prepared for and entered the Polytechnic, which\r\nis said to demand more hard study than any other school in the world.\r\nHe made his first campaign in Africa in 1835, and afterwards served\r\nwith distinction in the early part of that one which resulted in\r\nthe retreat from Constantine; but before Constantine was reached,\r\na severe illness invalided him. He was a liberal in politics, the\r\nsincere friend of the working-classes, and was on intimate terms\r\nwith men of letters, even with Victor Hugo, in spite of his advanced\r\nopinions. He was a patron of art and artists. Some beautiful\r\ntable-pieces that he had ordered, by Barye, are now in the gallery\r\nof Mr. W. S. Walters, of Baltimore, they not having been completed\r\nwhen he died. His wife charmed every one by her good sense, grace,\r\nand goodness. They had had four years of happy married life, and\r\nhad two little sons, when, in July, 1842, the duchess went for\r\nher health to the baths of Plombières, in the mountains of the\r\nVosges. Her husband escorted her thither, and then returned to\r\nParis, on his way to attend some military manoeuvres near Boulogne.\r\n\r\nAs he was driving out to Neuilly to make his _adieux_ to his family,\r\nthe horses of his carriage were startled by an organ-grinder on the\r\nAvenue de Neuilly. The duke, who was alone, tried apparently to\r\njump out of the carriage. Had he remained seated, all would have\r\nbeen well. He fell on his head on the _pavé_ of the broad avenue,\r\nbreaking the vertebral column.\r\n\r\nHe was carried into a small grocer's shop by the way-side, where\r\nafterwards a little chapel was erected by his family. Messengers\r\nwere sent to the Château de Neuilly, and his father, mother, and\r\nsisters, without bonnets or hats, came rushing to the spot. He\r\nlived, unconscious, for four hours. A messenger was despatched\r\nat once to bring his wife from Plombières. She had just finished\r\ndressing for dinner, in full toilet, when the news reached her.\r\nWithout changing her dress, she started instantly for Paris, but\r\nwhen she reached it, her husband was in his coffin.\r\n\r\nWhen his will was opened, it was found to contain an earnest exhortation\r\nto his son that, whether he proved \"one of those tools that Heaven\r\nfits for work, but does not use,\" or ascended the French throne,\r\nhe \"should always hold in his heart, above all things, love to\r\nFrance, and fidelity to the principles of the French Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the poor Queen Amélie's account of the death of her son,\r\nwritten to a dear friend four days after:--\r\n\r\n\"My Chartres,[1] my beloved son, he whose birth made all my happiness,\r\nwhose infancy and growing years were all my occupation, whose youth\r\nwas my pride and consolation, and who would, as I hoped, be the\r\nprop of my old age, no longer lives. He has been taken from us in\r\nthe midst of completed happiness, and of the happiest prospects of\r\nthe future, whilst each day he gained in virtue, in understanding,\r\nin wisdom, following the footsteps of his noble and excellent father.\r\nHe was more than a son to me,--he was my best friend. And God has\r\ntaken him from me!... On the 2d of July he and Hélène left for\r\nPlombières, where the latter was to take the baths. He was, after\r\nestablishing her there, to come back and spend a few days at the\r\ncamp of St.-Omer, there to take command of an army corps, which\r\nwas intended to execute great military manoeuvres on the Marne,\r\nand which had been the object of his thoughts and employments for\r\na year past. Accordingly, on the 9th he returned from Plombières,\r\nand came to dine with us at Neuilly, full of the subject of the\r\nelections, and talking of them with that warmth of heart and intellect\r\nwhich was apparent in all he did. Next day--my _fête_ day--he came,\r\ncontrary to his usual custom, with an enormous bouquet, telling\r\nme it was given in the name of the whole family. He heard mass,\r\nand breakfasted with us. He was so cheerful. He sat beside me at\r\ndinner. He got up, drank my health with much vivacity, and made\r\nthe band play a particular tune,--in my honor, as he said. Who\r\nwould have thought that this was the last time this dear child\r\nwas to show me so much affection! On the 11th he again returned\r\nto dinner with us, much occupied all the time with the camp and\r\nthe elections....\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It was his first title before his father came to the\r\nthrone. His mother always continued to use it.]\r\n\r\n\"On the 12th he arrived about four o'clock in his country suit. We\r\nconversed together about the health of Hélène, which was a subject\r\nof anxiety, about Clémentine's marriage, which he earnestly desired;\r\nabout the elections and many other subjects, the discussion of\r\nwhich he always ended with the refrain: 'In short, dear Majesty,\r\nwe finish as usual by agreeing in all important particulars.' And\r\nit was very true.\r\n\r\n\"After dinner we took a turn in the park, he and Victoire, Clémentine,\r\nD'Aumale, and I. Never had he been so gay, so brilliant, so\r\naffectionate. He spoke to me of his arrangements for the troops,\r\nof the time when the king was to go with us to Ste.-Menehoulde, of\r\nthe time that he would spend there, and of his own daily occupations.\r\nHe looked forward to giving his father a representation of the\r\nbattle of Valmy. I gave him my arm, saying: 'Come, dear prop of\r\nmy old age!' And the next day he was to be alive no longer!\r\n\r\n\"We returned to the drawing-room a little late. A great many people\r\nhad arrived. He remained with us talking until ten o'clock, when\r\non going away he came to bid me good-night. I gave him my hand,\r\nand said: 'You will come and see us tomorrow before going away?'\r\nHe replied: 'Perhaps so.'\r\n\r\n\"On the next day, July 13, about eleven o'clock, we were about\r\nto get into the carriage to go to the Tuileries. As I followed\r\nthe king to the red drawing-room, I saw Troussart, the commissary\r\nof police, with a terrified countenance whispering something to\r\nGeneral Gourgaud, who made a gesture of horror, and went to speak\r\nin a low voice to the king. The king cried out: 'Oh, my God!'\r\nThen I cried: 'Something has happened to one of my children! Let\r\nnothing be kept from me!' The king replied: 'Yes, my dear; Chartres\r\nhas had a fall on his way here, and has been carried into a house\r\nat Sablonville.' Hearing this, I began to run like a madwoman,\r\nin spite of the cries of the king and the remonstrances of M. de\r\nChabannes, who followed me. But my strength was not equal to my\r\nimpulses, and on getting as far as the farm, I was exhausted. Happily\r\nthe king came up in the carriage with my sister, and I got in with\r\nthem. Our carriage stopped. We got out in haste, and went into the\r\n_cabaret_, where in a small room, stretched upon a mattress on\r\nthe floor, we found Chartres, who was at that moment being bled....\r\nThe death-rattle had begun. 'What is that?' said the king to me. I\r\nreplied: '_Mon ami_, this is death. For pity's sake let some one\r\nfetch a priest, that my poor child may not die like a dog!' and\r\nI went for a moment into a little side room, where I fell on my\r\nknees and implored God from my inmost soul, if He needed a victim,\r\nto take me and spare so dear a child....\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Pasquier arrived soon after. I said to him: 'Sir, you are\r\na man of honor; if you think the danger imminent, I beseech you\r\ntell me so, that my child may receive extreme unction.' He hung\r\nhis head, and said: 'Madame, it is true.'\r\n\r\n\"The _curé_ of Neuilly came and administered the sacrament while\r\nwe were all on our knees around the pallet, weeping and praying.\r\nI unloosed from my neck a small cross containing a fragment of the\r\nTrue Cross, and I put it into the hand of my poor child, that God\r\nthe Saviour might have pity on him in his passage into eternity.\r\nDr. Pasquier got up and whispered to the king. Then that venerable\r\nand unhappy father, his face bathed in tears, knelt by the side\r\nof his eldest son, and tenderly embracing him, cried; 'Oh that\r\nit were I instead of thee!' I also drew near and kissed him three\r\ntimes,--once for myself, once for Hélène, and once for his children.\r\nI laid upon his lips the little cross, the symbol of our redemption,\r\nand then placed it on his heart and left it there. The whole family\r\nkissed him by turns, and then each returned to his place.... His\r\nbreathing now became irregular. Twice it stopped, and then went\r\non. I asked that the priest might come back and say the prayers\r\nfor the dying. He had scarcely knelt down and made the sign of\r\nthe cross, when my dear child drew a last deep breath, and his\r\nbeautiful, good, generous, and noble soul left his body.... The\r\npriest at my request said a _De profundis_. The king wanted to\r\nlead me away, but I begged him to allow me to embrace for the last\r\ntime my beloved son, the object of my deepest tenderness. I took\r\nhis dear head in my hands; I kissed his cold and discolored lips;\r\nI placed the little cross again upon them, and then carried it\r\naway, bidding a last farewell to him whom I loved so well,--perhaps\r\ntoo well!\r\n\r\n\"The king led me into the next room. I fell on his neck. We were\r\nunhappy together. Our irreparable loss was common to us both, and\r\nI suffered as much for him as for myself. There was a crowd in that\r\nlittle room. I wept and talked wildly, and I was beside myself.\r\nI recognized no one but the unhappy Marshal Gérard, the extent of\r\nwhose misfortune I then understood.[1] After a few minutes they\r\nsaid that all was ready. The body had been placed on a stretcher\r\ncovered with a white cloth. It was borne by four men of the house,\r\nattended by two gendarmes. They went out through the stable-yard;\r\nthere was an immense crowd outside.... We all followed on foot\r\nthe inanimate body of this dear son, who a few hours before had\r\npassed over the same road full of life, strength, and happiness....\r\nThus we carried him, and laid him down in our dear little chapel,\r\nwhere four days before he had heard mass with the whole family.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Marshal Gérard was then mourning for his son.]\r\n\r\nThe death of the Duke of Orleans was the severest blow that could\r\nhave fallen on Louis Philippe, not only as a father, but as head\r\nof a dynasty. The duke left two infant sons,--the Comte de Paris\r\nand the Duc de Chartres. The former is now both the Orleanist and\r\nLegitimist pretender, to the French throne.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1845 Louis Philippe, who had already visited\r\nWindsor and been cordially received there, was visited in return at\r\nhis Château d'Eu by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, accompanied\r\nby Lord Aberdeen, then English Minister for Foreign Affairs. The\r\nking's reception of the young queen was most paternal. He kissed\r\nher like a father, and did everything in his power to make her\r\nvisit pleasant. Among the subjects discussed during the visit was\r\nthe question of \"the Spanish marriages.\"\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Queen of Spain, Isabella II., was just sixteen years\r\nold; her sister, the Infanta Luisa, was a year younger. Isabella\r\nwas the daughter of a vicious race, and with such a mother as she\r\nhad in Queen Christina, she had grown up to early womanhood utterly\r\nignorant and untrained. One of her ministers said of her that \"no\r\none could be astonished that she had vices, but the wonder was\r\nthat she had by nature so many good qualities.\" Jolly, kindly,\r\ngenerous, a rebel against etiquette, and an habitual breaker of\r\npromises, she was long popular in Spain, in spite of a career of\r\ndissoluteness only equalled by that of Catherine of Russia.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, however, she had not shown this tendency, and in the hands\r\nof a good husband might have made as good a wife and as respectable\r\na woman as her sister Luisa has since proved.\r\n\r\nThere were many candidates for the honor of Queen Isabella's hand.\r\nLouis Philippe sent his sons D'Aumale and Montpensier to Madrid to\r\ntry their fortunes; but England objected strongly to an alliance\r\nwhich might make Spain practically a part of France. The candidature\r\nof the French princes was therefore withdrawn.\r\n\r\nA prince of the Catholic branch of the Coburgs was then\r\nproposed,--Prince Ferdinand, who made subsequently an excellent\r\nking-consort in Portugal; but to him France objected, as too nearly\r\nallied to the English Crown. Finally the suitors were reduced to\r\nthree,--the queen's cousin Enrique (Henry), a rough sailor of rather\r\nradical opinions and turbulent ways; the Comte de Trepani, a Neapolitan\r\nprince, a man of small understanding; and another cousin, Don Francisco\r\nd'Assis, a creature weak alike in mind and body, whom it was an\r\noutrage to think of as fit mate for a young queen. England was\r\nwilling to consent to the queen's marrying anyone of these princes,\r\nand also that the Duc de Montpensier should marry the Infanta Luisa,\r\nprovided that the queen was first married and had had a child. All\r\nthis was fully agreed upon in the conference at Eu. But Christina,\r\nthe queen-mother, who had been plundering the Spanish treasury till\r\nshe had accumulated an enormous fortune, offered, if Louis Philippe\r\nwould use his influence to prevent any inquiry into the state of\r\nher affairs, to further his views as to the Duc de Montpensier.\r\n\r\nIt seems more like a scene in the Middle Ages than an actual transaction\r\nin our own century, that at midnight, in a Spanish palace, a dissolute\r\nItalian dowager and a French ambassador should have been engaged\r\nin coercing a sovereign of sixteen into a detested marriage. As\r\nmorning dawned, the sobbing girl had given her consent to marry\r\nDon Francisco, and the ambassador of Louis Philippe, pale from\r\nthe excitement of his vigil, left the palace to send word of his\r\ndisgraceful victory to his master. The Duc de Montpensier, who was\r\nin waiting on the frontier, soon arrived in Madrid, and Isabella\r\nand Luisa were married on the same day; while M. Guizot, who was\r\nhead of the French Government, and Louis Philippe excused their\r\nbreach of faith to the queen of England by saying that Queen Isabella\r\n_was_ married before her sister, though on the same morning.\r\n\r\nIsabella at once banished her unwelcome husband to a country seat,\r\nand flung herself headlong into disgraceful excesses.\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria was greatly hurt by the treachery displayed by Louis\r\nPhilippe and his minister, and doubtless, as a woman she was deeply\r\nsorry for the young queen. Louis Philippe not only lost credit,\r\npopularity, and the support he derived from the personal friendship\r\nof the Queen and the Prince Consort of England, but he obtained no\r\nchance of the throne of Spain for his son by his wicked devices;\r\nfor Queen Isabella, far from being childless, had three daughters\r\nand a son. The latter, subsequently Alfonso XII., married, in spite\r\nof much opposition, his lovely cousin Mercedes, daughter of the\r\nDuke and Duchess of Montpensier. She died a few months after her\r\nmarriage, so that no son or grandson of Louis Philippe will be\r\npermitted by Providence to mount the Spanish throne.\r\n\r\nThe affair of the Spanish marriages, the quarrel it involved with\r\nQueen Victoria, and the loss to Louis Philippe of personal honor,\r\nhad a great effect upon him; he became irritable and obstinate,\r\nand at the same time weak of will.\r\n\r\nTroubles multiplied around him. Things with which he had nothing\r\nwhatever to do increased his unpopularity, and the secret societies\r\nkept discontents alive. Everything that went wrong in France was\r\ncharged upon the king and the royal family.\r\n\r\nOne of the great families in France was that of Choiseul-Praslin.\r\nThe head of it in Louis Philippe's time was a duke who had married\r\nFanny, daughter of Marshal Sébastiani, an old officer of Napoleon\r\nand a great favorite with Louis Philippe. The Duc de Praslin had\r\ngiven in his adhesion to the Orleans dynasty, while so many old\r\nfamilies stood aloof, and was in consequence made an officer in\r\nthe Duchess of Orleans' household. The Duc and Duchesse de Praslin\r\nhad ten children. The duchess was a stout, matronly little woman,\r\nrather pretty, with strong affections and a good deal of sentiment.\r\nSeveral times she had had cause to complain of her husband, and\r\n_did_ complain somewhat vehemently to her own family; but their\r\nmatrimonial differences had always been made up by Marshal Sébastiani.\r\nThe world considered them a happy married pair.\r\n\r\nAfter seventeen years of married life a governess was engaged for\r\nthe nine daughters, a Mademoiselle Henriette de Luzy. She was a\r\nParisian by birth, but had been educated in England, had English\r\nconnections, and spoke English fluently. She was one of those women\r\nwho make a favorable impression upon everyone brought into personal\r\ncontact with them. Soon the children adored her, and it was not\r\nlong before the duke had come under the same spell. The duchess\r\nfound herself completely isolated in her own household; husband\r\nand children had alike gone over to this stranger. The duchess\r\nwrote pathetic letters to her husband, pleading her own affection\r\nfor him, and her claims as a wife and a mother. These letters no\r\ndoubt exasperated the duke, but we read them with deep pity for\r\nher whose heart they lay bare.\r\n\r\nIt is to be understood that there was apparently no scandal--that\r\nis, scandal in the usual sense--in the relations between the duke\r\nand Mademoiselle de Luzy. She had simply bewitched a weak man who\r\nhad grown tired of his wife, and had cast the same spell over his\r\nchildren; and she had not the superiority of character which would\r\nhave led her to throw up a lucrative situation because she was\r\nmaking a wife and mother (whom doubtless she considered very\r\nunreasonable) extremely unhappy.\r\n\r\nAt last things came to such a pass that Madame de Praslin appealed\r\nto her father, insisting on a legal separation from her husband.\r\nThe marshal intervened, and the affair was compromised. Mademoiselle\r\nde Luzy was to be honorably discharged, and the duchess was to\r\nrenounce her project of separation. Mademoiselle de Luzy therefore\r\ngave up her situation, and went to board in a _pension_ in Paris\r\nwith her old schoolmistress. Madame de Praslin went to her country\r\nhouse, the magnificent Château de Vaux, where she herself undertook\r\nthe education of her children; but in their estimation she by no\r\nmeans replaced Mademoiselle de Luzy, whom from time to time they\r\nvisited in company with their father.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the summer of 1847 it was arranged that the whole\r\nfamily should go to the seaside, and they came up to Paris to pass\r\none night in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré at the Hôtel Sébastiani.\r\nLike most French establishments, the Hôtel Sébastiani was divided\r\nbetween the marshal and his daughter, the old marshal occupying one\r\nfloor during the winter, the duke and duchess, with their family,\r\nthe one above it, while the servants of both establishments had\r\ntheir sleeping-rooms under the roof. The house was of gray stone,\r\nstanding back in a yard; the French call such a situation _entre\r\ncour et jardin_. The duke had been in Paris several times during the\r\nprevious week, and had occupied his own rooms, where the concierge\r\nand his wife--the only servants left in the house--had remarked\r\nthat he seemed very busy.\r\n\r\nIt was afterwards reported in the neighborhood, but I do not think\r\nthe circumstance was ever officially brought out, that the police\r\nfound subsequently that all the screws but one that held up the\r\nheavy tester over the bed of the duchess, had been removed, and the\r\nholes filled with wax; it is certain that the duke partly unscrewed\r\nthe bolt that fastened the door of her dressing-room.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the family's arrival in Paris, the father and\r\nchildren went in a carriage to see Mademoiselle de Luzy. She told\r\nthe duke that she could get a good situation, provided the duchess\r\nwould give her a certificate of good conduct; and the duke at parting\r\npromised to obtain it for her.\r\n\r\nThe whole family went to bed early, that they might be ready to\r\nstart for the seaside betimes upon the morrow. The children's rooms\r\nwere in a wing of the building, at some distance from the chambers\r\nof their father and mother. The concierge and his wife slept in\r\ntheir lodge. Towards one o'clock in the morning they were awakened\r\nby screams; but they lay still, imagining that the noise came from\r\nthe Champs Elysées. Then they heard the loud ringing of a bell,\r\nand starting from their bed, rushed into the main building. The\r\nnoise had proceeded from the duchess's chamber. They knocked at\r\nthe door, but there was no answer, only low moans. They consulted\r\ntogether, and then roused the maid and valet, who were sleeping in\r\nthe attic chambers. Again they knocked, and there was no answer.\r\nThe valet then went to the duke's room, which looked upon the garden\r\nand communicated with the dressing-room of the duchess by a balcony\r\nand window as well as by the door. The duke opened the door of\r\nhis chamber. He was in his dressing-gown. When he heard what was\r\nthe matter, he went at once through the window into the duchess's\r\nchamber. There a scene of carnage unparalleled, I think, in the\r\nhistory of murder met their eyes. The duchess was lying across\r\nher bed, not yet quite dead, but beyond the power of speech. There\r\nwere more than forty wounds on her body. She must have struggled\r\ndesperately. The walls were bloody, the bell-rope was bloody, and\r\nthe floor was bloody. The nightdress of the duchess was saturated\r\nwith blood. Her hands were cut almost to pieces, as if she had\r\ngrasped the blade of the knife that killed her. The furniture was\r\noverturned in all parts of the room.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: We were then living near the Hotel Sébastini. The\r\nexcitement in the neighborhood the next morning is indescribable.]\r\n\r\nAt once the valet and the concierge ran for the police, for members\r\nof the family, and for a doctor. The duke retired to his dressing-room.\r\nOne of the gentlemen who first arrived was so sickened by the sight\r\nof the bloody room that he begged for a glass of water. The valet\r\nran for the nearest water at hand, and abruptly entered the duke's\r\ndressing-room. He had a glass with him, and was going to fill it\r\nfrom a pail standing near, when the duke cried out: \"Don't touch it;\r\nit is dirty;\" and at once emptied the contents out of the window,\r\nbut not before the valet had seen that the water was red with blood.\r\nThis roused his suspicions, and when all the servants in the house\r\nwere put under arrest, he said quietly to the police: \"You had\r\nbetter search the duke's dressing-room.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this was done there could be no more doubt. Three fancy daggers\r\nwere found, one of which had always hung in the chamber of the\r\nduchess. All of them were stained with blood. The duke had changed\r\nhis clothes, and had tried to wash those he took off in the pail\r\nwhose bloody water he had thrown away. Subsequently it was conjectured\r\nthat his purpose had been to stab his wife in her sleep, and then\r\nby a strong pull to bring down upon her the heavy canopy. The bolt\r\nhe had unscrewed permitted him at dead of night quietly to enter\r\nher chamber.\r\n\r\nThe police were puzzled as to how they ought to treat the murderer.\r\nAs he was a peer of France, they could not legally arrest him without\r\nauthority from the Chamber of peers, or from the king. The royal\r\nfamily was at Dreux. The king was appealed to at once, and immediately\r\ngave orders to arrest the duke and to summon the peers for his\r\ntrial. But meantime the duke, who had been guarded by the police\r\nin his own chamber, had contrived to take poison. He took such\r\na quantity of arsenic that his stomach rejected it. He did not\r\ndie at once, but lingered several days, and was carried to prison\r\nat the Luxembourg, where the poison killed him by inches. He died\r\nuntried, having made no confession.\r\n\r\nHis son, who was very young at the time of his parents' death,\r\nmarried an American lady when he grew to manhood. It was a long\r\ncourtship, for the young duke's income went largely to keep in\r\nrepair his famous Château de Vaux, where Fouquet had entertained\r\nLouis XIV. with regal magnificence. Finally a purchaser was found\r\nfor the ancestral seat; and relieved of the obligations it involved,\r\nthe duke married, and retired to his estates in Corsica.\r\n\r\nAs to Mademoiselle de Luzy, she was tried for complicity in the\r\nmurder of the duchess, and acquitted. There was no evidence whatever\r\nagainst her. But popular feeling concerning her as the inciting\r\ncause of the poor duchess's death was so strong that by the advice\r\nof her pastor--the Protestant M. Coquerel--she changed her name and\r\ncame to America. She brought letters of introduction to a family\r\nin Boston, who procured her a situation as governess in Connecticut.\r\nThere she soon after married a Congregational minister.\r\n\r\nIt seems hard to imagine how such a tragedy could have borne its\r\npart among the causes of Louis Philippe's downfall; but those who\r\nlook into Alison or Lamartine will see it set down as one of the\r\nevents which greatly assisted in bringing about the revolution of\r\nFebruary. Mobs, like women, are often swayed by persons rather\r\nthan by principles.\r\n\r\nIt was believed by the populace that court favor had prevented\r\nthe duke from going to prison like any common criminal, and that\r\nthe same influence had procured him the poison by which he escaped\r\na public execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE DOWNFALL OF LOUIS PHILIPPE.\r\n\r\nAs I said in the last chapter, everything in the year 1847 and during\r\nthe opening weeks of 1848 seemed unfavorable to Louis Philippe.\r\nBesides the causes of dissatisfaction I have mentioned, there was\r\na scarcity of grain, there were drains on the finances, there was\r\ndisaffection among the National Guard, and hostility among the\r\npeers to the measures of the Ministry. Then came the conviction\r\nof M. Teste, a member of the Cabinet, for misappropriating public\r\nfunds. Even private affairs seemed turned against the royal family.\r\nMadame Lafarge murdered her husband, and it was said that the court\r\nhad attempted to procure her acquittal because she was connected\r\nwith the house of Orleans by a bar-sinister. A quarrel about an\r\nactress led to a duel. The man wounded was a journalist who was\r\nactively opposed to the king's Government. It was hinted that the\r\nduel was a device of the court to get him put out of the way. But\r\nthe greatest of the king's misfortunes was the death of his admirable\r\nsister, Madame Adélaïde, in January, 1848. She had been all his life\r\nhis bosom friend and his chief counsellor. She died of a severe\r\nattack of influenza.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from the Prince de Joinville to the Duc de Nemours,\r\nfound in the garden of the Tuileries in February, 1848, among many\r\nvaluable documents that had been flung from the windows of the\r\npalace by the mob, the situation of things at the close of 1847\r\nand the beginning of 1848 is thus summed up by one brother writing\r\nin confidence to another:--\r\n\r\n\"The king will listen to no advice. His own will must be paramount\r\nover everything. It seems to me impossible that in the Chamber of\r\nDeputies at the next session the anomalous state of the government\r\nshould fail to attract attention. It has effaced all traces of\r\nconstitutional government, and has put forward the king as the\r\nprimary, and indeed sole, mover upon all occasions. There is no\r\nlonger any respect for ministers; their responsibility is null,\r\neverything rests with the king. He has arrived at an age when he\r\ndeclines to listen to suggestions. He is accustomed to govern,\r\nand he loves to show that he does so. His immense experience, his\r\ncourage, and his great qualities lead him to face danger; but it\r\nis not on that account the less real or imminent.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after further summing up the state of France,--the finances\r\nembarrassed, the _entente cordiale_ with England at an end, and the\r\nprovinces in confusion,--the prince adds: \"Those unhappy Spanish\r\nmarriages!--we have not yet drained the cup of bitterness they\r\nhave mixed for us to drink.\"\r\n\r\nIn this state of things the opposition party was divided into liberals\r\nwho wished for reform, and liberals who aimed at revolution. For\r\na while the two parties worked together, and their war-cry was\r\nReform! There was little or no parliamentary opposition, for the\r\nChamber of Peers and the Chamber of Deputies were alike virtually\r\nchosen by the Crown. The population of France in 1848 was thirty-five\r\nmillions; but those entitled to vote were only two hundred and\r\nforty thousand, or one to every one hundred and forty-six of the\r\npopulation, and of these a large part were in Government employ.\r\nIt was said that the number of places in the gift of the Ministry\r\nwas sixty-three thousand, every place, from that of a guard upon\r\na railroad to that of a judge upon the bench, being disposed of\r\nby ministerial favor.\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted to give expression to the public discontent was\r\nthe inauguration of reform banquets. To these large crowds were\r\nattracted, both from political motives and from a desire in the\r\nrural districts to hear the great speakers, Lamartine and others,\r\nwho had a national renown. Many of the speeches were inflammatory.\r\nThe health of the king was never drunk on these occasions, but\r\nthe \"Marseillaise\" was invariably played.\r\n\r\nSeventy-four of these banquets had been given in the provinces,\r\nwhen it was decided to give one in Paris; and a large inclosed piece\r\nof ground on the Rue Chaillot, not far from the Arch of Triumph,\r\nwas fixed upon for the purpose. This banquet was to take place on\r\nTuesday, Feb. 22, 1848. Until Monday afternoon opinions seemed\r\ndivided as to whether it would be suffered to go on. But meantime the\r\ncity had been crammed with troops, and the sleep of its inhabitants\r\nhad been broken night after night by the tramp of regiments and the\r\nrumble of artillery. Monday, February 21, was a beautiful day,\r\nthe air was soft and genial, the streets and the Champs Elysées\r\nwere very gay. Scarcely any one was aware at that time that it\r\nwas the intention of the Government to forbid the banquet; but\r\nthat night the preparations made for it were carted away by order\r\nof the liberal leaders, who had been warned of the decision of the\r\nauthorities, while at the same time every loose paving-stone that\r\nmight help to erect a barricade was, by orders from the police,\r\nremoved out of the way.\r\n\r\nWhen morning dawned, a proclamation, forbidding the banquet, was\r\nposted on every street-corner. The soldiers were everywhere confined\r\nto their quarters, the windows of which were stuffed with mattresses;\r\nbut to residents in Paris the day seemed to pass quietly, though\r\nabout noon the Place de la Madeleine was full of men surrounding\r\nthe house of Odillon Barrot, the chief leader of the opposition,\r\ndemanding what, under the circumstances, they had better do. In the\r\nPlace de la Concorde, troops were endeavoring to prevent the crowd\r\nfrom crossing the Seine and assembling in front of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. In order to break up the throng upon the bridge, a heavy\r\nwagon was driven over it at a rapid pace, escorted by soldiers, who\r\nslashed about them with their sheathed swords. At the residence\r\nof M. Guizot, then both Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, a large crowd had assembled and had broken his windows;\r\nbut the rioters were dispersed the Municipal Guard and the Police.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, on the Place de la Concorde, a party of men and\r\nboys, apparently without leaders, contrived to break through the\r\ntroops guarding the bridge, and began to ascend the steps of the\r\nChamber of Deputies. Being refused admission to the hall, they\r\nproceeded to break windows and do other damage. Then a party of\r\ndragoons began to clear the bridge, but good-humoredly, and the\r\npeople were retiring as fast as they might, when a detachment of the\r\nMunicipal Guard arrived. The Municipal Guard was a handsome corps\r\nof mounted police, the men being all stalwart and fine-looking. They\r\nwore brazen helmets and horse-tails and glittering breastplates,\r\nbut they were very unpopular, while the National Guards were looked\r\non by the rioters as their supporters. The Municipal Guards, when\r\nthey came upon the bridge, began treating the crowd roughly, a\r\ngood many persons were hurt, and an old woman was trodden down. At\r\nthis the crowd grew furious, stones were thrown, and the soldiers\r\ndrew their swords. Before nightfall there was riot and disorder all\r\nover Paris. Towards dusk the _rappel_--the signal for the National\r\nGuard to muster--had been beaten in the streets, and soon many\r\nsoldiers of that body might be seen, escorted by men in blouses\r\ncarrying their guns, while the National Guards, unarmed, were shouting\r\nand singing.\r\n\r\nAll Tuesday, February 22, the affair was a mere riot. But during\r\nthe night the secret societies met, and decided on more formidable\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe next morning was chilly and rainy, very dispiriting to the\r\ntroops, who had bivouacked all night in the public squares, where\r\nthey had been ill-provided with food and forage. The coats and\r\nswords of the students at the Polytechnic had been removed during\r\nthe night, to prevent their joining the bands who were singing the\r\n\"Marseillaise\" and the \"Dernier Chant des Girondins\" under their\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nMeantime barricades had been raised in the thickly populated parts of\r\nParis, and successful efforts had been made to enlist the sympathies\r\nof the soldiers and the National Guard.\r\n\r\nDuring the early hours of Wednesday, the 23d, reports of these\r\ndisaffections succeeded each other rapidly at the Tuileries, and\r\na council was held in the king's cabinet, to which the queen and\r\nthe princes were invited. The king spoke of resigning his crown,\r\nadding that he was \"fortunate in being able to resign it.\" \"But\r\nyou cannot abdicate, _mon ami_,\" said the queen. \"You owe yourself\r\nto France. The demand made is for the resignation of the Ministry.\r\nM. Guizot should resign, and I feel sure that being the man of\r\nhonor that he is, he will do so in this emergency.\"\r\n\r\nM. Guizot and his colleagues at once gave in their resignations.\r\nThe king wept as he embraced them, bidding them farewell. Count\r\nMolé was then called in and requested to form a ministry. Before\r\nhe could do so, however, things had grown worse, and M. Thiers,\r\ninstead of Count Molé, was made head of the Cabinet. He insisted\r\nthat Odillon Barrot, the day before very popular with the insurgents,\r\nmust be his colleague. The king declined to assent to this. To put\r\nOdillon Barrot into power, he said, was virtually to abandon the\r\npolicy of his reign.\r\n\r\nBut before this matter was decided, there had occurred a lamentable\r\nmassacre at the gates of the residence of M. Guizot, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs. The building had been surrounded by a fierce crowd,\r\ncomposed mainly of working-men from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Some\r\nconfusion was occasioned by the restlessness of a horse belonging\r\nto an officer in command of a squad of cavalry detailed to defend\r\nthe building. The leader of the mob fired a pistol. The soldiers\r\nresponded with a volley from their carbines. Fifty of the crowd were\r\nkilled. The bodies were piled by the mob upon a cart and paraded\r\nthrough Paris, the corpse of a half-naked woman lying conspicuously\r\namong them. The sight everywhere woke threats of vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe king, when he heard of this, yielded. Odillon Barrot was associated\r\nwith M. Thiers, and Marshal Bugeaud was placed in command of the\r\nmilitary.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers' foible was omniscience; and to Bugeaud's amazement,\r\namusement, and indignation he insisted on inspecting his military\r\nplans and giving his advice concerning them. Happily the marshal's\r\nplans met with the approval of the minister, and the commander-in-chief\r\nwent to his post; while Odillon Barrot, accompanied by Horace Vernet,\r\nthe painter, went forth into the streets to inform the insurgents\r\nthat their demand for reform had been granted, that the obnoxious\r\nministers had been dismissed, and that all power was made over\r\nto himself and to his colleagues.\r\n\r\nMarshal Bugeaud found everything in wild confusion at the War Office;\r\nbut was restoring order, and had marched four columns of troops\r\nthrough Paris without serious opposition, when he received orders\r\nfrom M. Thiers that not another shot was to be fired by the soldiers.\r\nThe marshal replied that he would not obey such orders unless he\r\nreceived them from the king. The Duc de Nemours therefore signed\r\nthe paper in the name of his father, and soon afterwards a new\r\nproclamation was posted on the walls:--\r\n\r\nCitizens! An order has been given to suspend all firing. We are\r\ncharged by the king to form a ministry. The Chamber is about to be\r\ndissolved. General Lamoricière has been appointed Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the National Guard. Messieurs Odillon Barrot, Thiers, Lamoricière,\r\nand Duvergier de Haurannes are ministers. Our watchwords are,--Order,\r\nUnion, Reform!\r\n\r\n  (Signed) ODILLON BARROT.\r\n           THIERS.\r\n\r\nThis proclamation may be said to have been the beginning of the\r\nend. The soldiers were disgusted; supporters of the monarchy lost\r\nheart; the secret societies now felt that the game was in their\r\nhands. By that time barricades without number, it was said, had\r\nbeen thrown up in the streets. The suburbs of Paris were cut off\r\nfrom the capital. During the previous night, arms had been everywhere\r\ndemanded from private houses; but in obtaining them the insurgents\r\nendeavored to inspire no unnecessary terror. One lady in the English\r\nquarter was found kneeling by the bedside of her dying child. When\r\na party of armed men entered the chamber they knelt down, joined\r\ntheir prayers to hers for the soul that was departing, and then\r\nquitted the room in silence, placing a guard and writing over the\r\ndoor in chalk: \"Respect this house, for death is here.\"\r\n\r\nBy nine o'clock on Wednesday morning the troops, disgusted by the\r\norder which forbade them to defend themselves, reversed their arms\r\nand fraternized with the people, the officers sheathing their swords.\r\n\r\nA little later, Odillon Barrot, who supposed himself to be the\r\npeople's favorite, rode along the Boulevard to proclaim to the\r\nrioters that he was now their minister, and that the cause of reform\r\nwas assured. He was met with cries of \"Never mind him! We have no\r\ntime to hear him! Too late, too late! We know all he has to say!\"\r\nAbout the same time the École Militaire was taken; but a guard\r\n_en blouse_ was posted to protect the apartments of the ladies\r\nof the governor. The fight before the Palais Royal occurred about\r\nnoon. The palace, which was the private property of Louis Philippe,\r\nwas sacked, and many valuable works of art were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe royal family were sitting down to breakfast about midday when\r\na party of gentlemen, among them M. Émile de Girardin, made their\r\nway into the Tuileries, imploring the king to abdicate at once\r\nand spare further bloodshed. Without a word, Louis Philippe drew\r\npen and paper towards him and wrote his abdication. Embracing his\r\ngrandson, the little Comte de Paris, he went out, saying to the\r\ngentlemen about him: \"This child is your king.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the Pavillon de l'Horloge, the main entrance to the Tuileries,\r\ncame a party of dragoons, leading their horses down the marble\r\nsteps into the gardens. The victorious blouses already filled the\r\ninner court, the Place du Carrousel. The royal family, slenderly\r\nattended, followed the king. The crowd poured into the Tuileries\r\non the side of the Carrousel as the royal family quitted it through\r\nthe gardens.\r\n\r\nIn the Place de la Concorde, beneath the old Egyptian obelisk which\r\nhad witnessed so many changes in this troubled world, they found\r\ntwo cabs in waiting. The king and queen entered one, with several\r\nof the children. Into the second stepped the Duchesse de Nemours,\r\nthe Princess Clémentine, and an attendant. Some persons in the\r\ncrowd who recognized them, cried out: \"Respect old age! Respect\r\nmisfortune!\" And when an officer in attendance called out to the\r\ncrowd not to hurt the king, he was answered: \"Do you take us for\r\nassassins? Let him get away!\"\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, was the general feeling. Only a few persons ventured\r\nto insult the royal family. The coachmen, however, drove off in such\r\nhaste that the Spanish princess, Luisa, Duchesse de Montpensier,\r\nwas left alone upon the sidewalk, weeping bitterly. A Portuguese\r\ngentleman gave her his arm, and took her in search of her husband's\r\naide-de-camp, General Thierry. With several other gentlemen, who\r\nformed a guard about her, they passed back into the garden of the\r\nTuileries, where M. Jules de Lasteyrie, the grandson of Lafayette,\r\ntook possession of the duchess and escorted her to his own house.\r\nFrom thence, a few days later, he forwarded her to the coast, where\r\nshe rejoined her husband.\r\n\r\nWhen the king quitted the Tuileries he was urged to leave behind\r\nhim a paper conferring the regency on the Duchess of Orleans. He\r\nrefused positively. \"It would be contrary to law,\" he said; \"and I\r\nhave never yet done anything, thank God! contrary to law.\" \"But what\r\nmust I do,\" asked the duchess, \"without friends, without relations,\r\nwithout counsel?\" \"_Ma chère Hélène_,\" the king replied, \"the dynasty\r\nand the crown of your son are intrusted to you. Remain here and\r\nprotect them.\"\r\n\r\nAs the mob began to pour into the palace after the king's departure,\r\nthe duchess, by the advice of M. Dupin, the President (or Speaker)\r\nof the Chamber, set out on foot to cross the bridge nearest to\r\nthe palace, and to reach the Palais Bourbon. She held her eldest\r\nson, the Comte de Paris, by the hand; her youngest, who was too\r\nsmall to walk, was carried by an aide-de-camp. Beside them walked\r\nM. Dupin, the Duc de Nemours, and a faithful servant. They left\r\nthe Tuileries in such haste that they failed to give orders to\r\nthe faithful Garde Municipale, who would have suffered the fate\r\nof the Swiss Guard in 1792, had not National Guards in the crowd\r\nassisted them to change their conspicuous uniforms and to escape\r\nout of the windows.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half hour after the invasion of the palace a great\r\ndeal of money and many other valuables disappeared; but after that\r\ntime it was death to appropriate anything, even if it were of little\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nSoon the gardens of the Tuileries were white with papers flung\r\nfrom the windows of the palace, many of them of great historical\r\nvalue. A piece of pink gauze, the property, probably, of some\r\nmaid-of-honor, streamed from one of the windows in the roof and\r\nfluttered across the whole building. The crowd, in high good humor,\r\ntossed forth livery coats, fragments of state furniture, and papers.\r\nThe beds still stood unmade, and all the apparatus of the ladies'\r\ntoilet-tables remained in disorder. In one royal bed-chamber a\r\nman was rubbing pomade with both hands into his hair, another was\r\ndrenching himself with perfume, a third was scrubbing his teeth\r\nfuriously with a brush that had that morning parted the lips of\r\nroyalty. In another room a man _en blouse_ was seated at a piano\r\nplaying the \"Marseillaise\" to an admiring audience (the \"Marseillaise\"\r\nhad been forbidden in Paris for many years). Elsewhere a party of\r\n_gamins_ were turning over a magnificent scrapbook. In the next\r\nroom was a grand piano, on which four men were thumping at once.\r\nIn another, a party of working-men were dancing a quadrille, while\r\na gentleman played for them upon a piano. At every chimney-piece\r\nand before every work of art stood a guard, generally ragged and\r\npowder-stained, bearing a placard, \"Death to Robbers!\" while at the\r\nhead of the Grand Staircase others stood, crying, \"Enter, messieurs!\r\nEnter! We don't have cards of admission to this house every day!\"\r\nWhile the cry that passed through the crowd was: \"Look as much as\r\nyou like, but take nothing!\" \"Are not we magnificent in our own\r\nhouse, Monsieur?\" said a _gamin_ to an Englishman; while another\r\nwas to be seen walking about in one of poor Queen Amélie's state\r\nhead-dresses, surmounted by a bird-of-paradise with a long tail.\r\n\r\nAt first the crowd injured nothing, even the king's portraits being\r\nrespected; but after a while the destruction of state furniture\r\nbegan. Three men were seen smoking in the state bed; some ate up\r\nthe royal breakfast; and the cigars of the princes were freely\r\nhanded to rough men in the crowd.\r\n\r\nMeantime in the Chamber of Deputies the scene was terrible. M.\r\nDupin, its president, lost his head. Had he, when he knew of the\r\nking's abdication, declared the sitting closed, and directed the\r\nDeputies to disperse, he might possibly have saved the monarchy.\r\nBut the mob got possession of the _tribune_ (the pulpit from which\r\nalone speeches can be made in the Chamber); they pointed their guns\r\nat the Deputies, who cowered under their benches, and the last\r\nchance for Louis Philippe's dynasty was over. Odillon Barrot, who\r\nhad come down to the house full of self-importance, notwithstanding\r\nhis reception on the Boulevards, found that his hour was over and\r\nhis power gone.\r\n\r\nM. de Lamartine was the idol of the mob, though he was very nearly\r\nshot in the confusion. Armed insurgents crowded round him, clinging\r\nto his skirts, his hands, his knees. Throughout the tumult the\r\nreporters for the \"Moniteur\" kept their seats, taking notes of what\r\nwas passing.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Orleans found the Chamber occupied by armed men. She\r\nwas jostled and pressed upon. A feeble effort was made to proclaim\r\nher son king, and to appoint her regent during his minority. She\r\nendeavored several times to speak, and behaved with an intrepidity\r\nwhich did her honor. But when Lamartine, mounting the tribune,\r\ncast aside her claims, and announced that the moment had arrived\r\nfor proclaiming a provisional government and a republic, she was\r\nhustled and pushed aside by the crowd.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in deep mourning. Her long black veil, partly raised,\r\nshowed her fair face marred with sorrow and anxiety. Her children\r\nwere dressed in little black velvet skirts and jackets, with large\r\nwhite turned-down collars. Soon the crowd around the tribune, beneath\r\nwhich the duchess had her seat, grew so furious that her attendants,\r\nfearing for her life, hurried her away.\r\n\r\nIn the press and the confusion the Duc de Nemours and her two children\r\nwere parted from her. The Comte de Paris was seized by a gigantic\r\nman _en blouse_, who said afterwards that he had been only anxious\r\nto protect the child; but a National Guard forced the boy from his\r\ngrasp, and restored him to his mother. The Duc de Chartres was\r\nfor some time lost, and was in great danger, having been knocked\r\ndown on the staircase by an ascending crowd.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, the little party, under the escort of the Duc\r\nde Nemours, who had disguised himself, escaped on foot into the\r\nstreets, then growing dark; and finding a hackney-coach, persuaded\r\nthe coachman to drive them to a place of safety. The Duc de Chartres\r\nwas not to be found, and his mother passed many hours of terrible\r\nanxiety before he was restored to her arms.\r\n\r\nVery strange that night was the scene in the Champs Elysées. They\r\nwere filled with a joyous and triumphant crowd in every variety of\r\nmilitary costume, and armed with every sort of weapon. Soldiers alone\r\nwere unarmed. They marched arm-in-arm with their new friends, singing,\r\nlike them, the \"Marseillaise\" and \"Mourir pour la Patrie.\" In the\r\nquarter of the Champs Elysées, where well-to-do foreigners formed a\r\nconsiderable part of the population, there was no ferocity exhibited\r\nby the mob. The insurgents were like children at play,--children on\r\ntheir good behavior. They had achieved a wonderful and unexpected\r\nvictory. The throne had fallen, as if built on sand. Those who\r\nhad overturned it were in high good-humor.\r\n\r\nA French mob at the present day is very different. It has the modern\r\ngrudge of laborer against employer, it has memories of the license\r\nof the Commune, and above all it has learned the use of _absinthe_.\r\nThere is a hatred and a contempt for all things that should command\r\nmen's reverence, which did not display itself in 1848.\r\n\r\nMay I here be permitted to relate a little story connected with\r\nthis day's events? I was with my family in Paris during those days\r\nof revolution. Our nurse,--an Englishwoman who had then been with us\r\ntwenty-five years, and who died recently, at the age of ninety-eight,\r\nstill a member of our family,--when we returned home from viewing\r\nthe devastation at the Tuileries, expressed strongly her regret\r\nat not having accompanied us. She was consoled, however, by an\r\noffer from our man-servant to escort her down the Champs Elysées.\r\nThey made their way to the Place du Carrousel, at the back of the\r\npalace, where a dense crowd was assembled, and the good lady became\r\nseparated from her protector. The National Guard and the servants\r\nin the palace had just succeeded in getting the crowd out of the\r\nrooms and in closing the doors. This greatly disappointed our good\r\nnurse. She had counted on seeing the interior of the king's abode,\r\nand above all, the king's throne. She could speak very little French,\r\nbut she must in some way have communicated her regrets to the crowd\r\naround her. \"Does Madame desire so much to pass in?\" said a big\r\nman in a blouse, girt with a red sash, and carrying a naked sword;\r\n\"then Madame _shall_ pass in!\" Thereupon he and his followers in\r\nthe front rank of the crowd so bepummelled the door with the hilts\r\nof their swords and the stocks of their muskets that those within\r\nwere forced to throw it open. In marched our dear nurse beside her\r\nprotector. They passed through room after room until they reached\r\nthe throne-room; there she indicated her wish to obtain a relic of\r\ndeparted royalty. Instantly her friend with the bare sword sliced\r\noff from the throne a piece of red velvet with gold embroidery.\r\nShe kept it ever after, together with a delicate china cup marked\r\nL. P.; but the cup was much broken. \"You see, dears,\" she would\r\nsay to us, \"there was lots of things like these lying about, but\r\nthere were men standing round with naked swords ready to cut your\r\nhead off if you stole anything. So I took this cup and broke it.\r\nIt was not stealing to carry off a broken cup, you know.\" And she\r\nwould add, when winding up her narrative: \"Those Frenchmen was\r\nso polite to me that they did n't even tread on my corns.\"\r\n\r\nThat night there was a brilliant conflagration in the Carrousel. It\r\nwas a bonfire of those very carriages which eighteen years before\r\nthe mob had brought in triumph to Louis Philippe from the stables\r\nof Charles X. at Rambouillet.\r\n\r\nAll the next day not a newspaper was to be had. The \"Presse,\" indeed,\r\nbrought out a half sheet, mainly taken up in returning thanks to two\r\ncompositors \"who, between two fires,\" had been \"so considerate\" as\r\nto set up the type. But their consideration could not have lasted\r\nlong, for the news broke off abruptly in the middle of a sentence\r\non the first page. Events worked faster than compositors.\r\n\r\nBy noon on Friday, February 25, the entire population of Paris\r\nwas in the streets. From the flags on public offices, the blue\r\nand white strips had been tom away. On that day--but on that day\r\nonly--every man wore a red ribbon in his button-hole. Many did so\r\nvery unwillingly, for red was understood to be the badge of Red\r\nRepublicanism.\r\n\r\nOn the Boulevards the iron railings had been tom up, and most of\r\nthe trees had been cut down. They were replanted, however, not\r\nlong after, to the singing of the \"Marseillaise\" and the firing of\r\ncannon. For more than a week there was a strange quiet in Paris:\r\nno vehicles were in the streets, for the paving-stones had been\r\ntorn up for barricades; no shops were open; on the closed shutters\r\nof most of them appeared the words \"Armes données,\" Everywhere a\r\npaintbrush had been passed over the royal arms. Even the words\r\n\"roi,\" \"reine,\" \"royal,\" were effaced. The patriots were very zealous\r\nin exacting these removals. Two _gamins_ with swords hacked patiently\r\nfor two hours at a cast-iron double-headed Austrian eagle.\r\n\r\nChange (small money, I mean) was hardly to be had in Paris. For\r\na month it was necessary, in order to obtain it, to apply at the\r\nMairie of the Arrondissement, and to stand for hours in a _queue_.\r\nOther money could be had only from the bankers in thousand-franc\r\nnotes. Shopping was of course at an end, and half Paris was thrown\r\nout of employment. Gold and silver were hidden away.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe and his family drove in their two cabriolets to\r\nVersailles. There they found great difficulty in getting post-horses.\r\nIndeed, they would have procured none, had there not been some\r\ncavalry horses in the place, which were harnessed to one of the\r\nroyal carriages. About midnight of their second day's journey they\r\nreached Dreux. There Louis Philippe found himself without money,\r\nand had to borrow from one of his tenants. He had left behind him\r\nin his haste three hundred and fifty thousand francs on a table\r\nin the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Government, which was kept well informed as to\r\nhis movements, forwarded to him a supply of money. At Dreux the\r\nking's party was joined by the Duke of Montpensier with news that\r\nthe king's attempt to save the monarchy by abdication had failed.\r\n\r\nThe old man seemed stupefied by his sudden fall. Over and over\r\nagain he was heard to repeat: \"Comme Charles X.! Comme Charles X.!\"\r\nThe next day, travelling under feigned names, the royal party pushed\r\non to Evreux, where they were hospitably received by a farmer in\r\nthe forest, who harnessed his work-horses to their carriage. Thence\r\nthey went on to their own Château d'Eu. The danger to which during\r\nthis journey they were exposed arose, not from the new Government\r\nat Paris, but from the excited state of the peasantry.\r\n\r\nAfter many perils and adventures, sometimes indeed travelling on\r\nfoot to avoid dangerous places, they reached Harfleur on March\r\n3. An English steamer, the \"Express,\" lay at the wharf, on which\r\nthe king and queen embarked as Mr. and Mrs. William Smith. The\r\nfollowing morning they were off the English coast, at Newbern.\r\nThey landed, and proceeded at once to Claremont, the palace given\r\nto their son-in-law, Leopold of Belgium, for his lifetime by the\r\nEnglish Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe government set up in Paris was a provisional one. The members\r\nof the Provisional Government were many of them well known to the\r\npublic, and of approved character. No men ever had a more difficult\r\ntask before them, and none ever tried with more self-sacrifice to\r\ndo their duty.\r\n\r\nThe measures they proposed were eighteen in number:\r\n\r\n  1. The retention of the tricolor.\r\n  2. The retention of the Gallic cock.\r\n  3. The sovereignty of the people.\r\n  4. The dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.\r\n  5. The suppression of the Chamber of Peers.\r\n  6. The convocation of a National Assembly.\r\n  7. Work to be guaranteed to all working-men.\r\n  8. The unity of the army and the populace.\r\n  9. The formation of a Garde Mobile.\r\n 10. The arrest and punishment of all deserters.\r\n 11. The release of all political prisoners.\r\n 12. The trial of M. Guizot and his colleagues.\r\n 13. The reduction of Vincennes and Fort Valérien, still held by the\r\n     troops for the king.\r\n 14. All officials under Louis Philippe to be released from their oaths.\r\n 15. All objects at the Mont de Piété (the Government pawn-broking\r\n     establishment) valued under ten francs, to be restored.\r\n 16. All National Guards dismissed under preceding Governments to be\r\n     reinstated.\r\n 17. The million of francs expended on the court to be given to disabled\r\n     workmen.\r\n 18. A paternal commission to be nominated, to look after the interests\r\n     of the working-classes.\r\n\r\nThe institution of the Garde Mobile was a device for finding employment\r\nfor those boys and young men who formed one of the most dangerous\r\nof the dangerous classes.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how tempting these promises were to working-men;\r\nand yet the better class among them mourned their loss of steady\r\nemployment. The Revolution of 1848, though it was not originated\r\nby the working-classes, was made to appear as if it were intended\r\nfor their profit; and that indeed was its ruin, for it was found\r\nimpossible to keep the promises of work, support, parental protection,\r\netc., made to the Parisian masses. The _bourgeoisie_, when they\r\nrecovered from their astonishment and found that the stone they\r\nhad set rolling under the name of reform had dislodged their own\r\nRevolution of 1830, and the peasants of the provinces, when they\r\nfound that all the praise and all the profits were solely for the\r\nworking-men of the capital, were very far from satisfied.\r\n\r\nAs to the upper classes, their terror and dismay were overwhelming.\r\nEverything seemed sliding away under their feet. Many women of rank\r\nand fashion, distrusting the stability of the king's government, had\r\nfor some time past been yearly adding diamonds to their necklaces,\r\nbecause, as one of them exclaimed to us during this month of February:\r\n\"We knew not what might happen to stocks or to securities, but\r\ndiamonds we can put into our pockets. No other property in France\r\ncan be called secure!\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet Paris soon resumed its wonted appearance. Commerce and\r\nshopping might be impossible in a city where nobody could make\r\nchange for two hundred dollars, yet the Champs Elysées were again\r\ngay with pedestrians and carriages. All favorite amusements were\r\nresumed, but almost all men being idle, their great resource was\r\nto assemble round the Hôtel-de-Ville and force Lamartine to make\r\na speech to them.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, March 4, all Paris crowded to the Boulevards to witness\r\nthe funeral _cortège_ of the victims. There were neither military\r\nnor police to keep order; yet the crowd was on its good behavior,\r\nand strict decorum was maintained. There were about three hundred\r\nthousand persons in the procession, and as many more on the sidewalks.\r\nAs they marched, mourners and spectators all sang the Chant of the\r\nGirondins (\"Mourir pour la Patrie\") and the \"Marseillaise.\"\r\n\r\nTwo things distinguished this revolution of February from all other\r\nFrench revolutions before or after it,--the high character and\r\nself-devotion of the men placed at the head of affairs, and the\r\nabsence of prejudice against religion. The revolution, so far from\r\nputting itself in antagonism with religious feeling, everywhere\r\nappealed to it. The men who invaded the Tuileries bowed before\r\nthe crucifix in the queen's chamber. Priests who were known to be\r\nzealous workers among the poor were treated as fathers. _Curés_\r\nblessed the trees of liberty planted in their parishes. Prayers for\r\nthe Republic were offered at the altars, and in country villages\r\npriests headed the men of their congregations who marched up to\r\nthe polls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ALPHONSE DE LAMARTINE._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLAMARTINE AND THE SECOND REPUBLIC.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For the subject-matter of this chapter I am largely\r\nindebted to Mrs. Oliphant's article on Lamartine in \"Blackwood's\r\nMagazine.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Government hastily set up in France on Feb. 24, 1848,\r\nconsisted at first of five members; but that number was afterwards\r\nenlarged. M. Dupin, who had been President of the Chamber of Deputies,\r\nwas made President of the Council (or prime minister); but the real\r\nhead of the Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs was Alphonse\r\nde Lamartine. He was a Christian believer, a high-minded man, by\r\nbirth an aristocrat, yet by sympathy a man of the masses. \"He was\r\nfull of sentimentalities of vainglory and of personal vanity; but\r\nno pilot ever guided a ship of state so skilfully and with such\r\nabsolute self-devotion through an angry sea. For a brief while,\r\njust long enough to effect this purpose, he was the idol of the\r\npopulace.\" With him were associated Crémieux, a Jew; Ledru-Rollin,\r\nthe historian, a Red Republican; Arago, the astronomer; Hypolite\r\nCarnot, son of Lazare Carnot, Member of the Directory, father of\r\nthe future president; General Casaignac, who was made governor of\r\nAlgeria; Garnier-Pagès, who a second time became, in 1870, member\r\nof a Provisional Government for the defence of Paris; and several\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of Louis Philippe startled and astonished even those\r\nwho had brought it about. They had intended reform, and they drew\r\ndown revolution. They hoped to effect a change of ministry: they\r\nwere disconcerted when they had dethroned a king. There were about\r\nthirty thousand regular troops in Paris, besides the National Guard\r\nand the mounted police, or Garde Municipale. No one had imagined\r\nthat the Throne of the Barricades would fall at the first assault.\r\nThere were no leaders anywhere in this revolution. The king's party\r\nhad no leaders; the young princes seemed paralyzed. The army had\r\nno leader; the commander-in-chief had been changed three times\r\nin twenty-four hours. The insurgents had no leaders. On February\r\n22 Odillon Barrot was their hero, and on February 23 they hooted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe republicans, to their own amazement, were left masters of the\r\nfield of battle, and Lamartine was pushed to the front as their\r\nchief man.\r\n\r\nI may here pause in the historical narrative to say a few words\r\nabout the personal history of Lamartine, which, indeed, will include\r\nall that history has to say concerning the Second Republic.\r\n\r\nThe love stories of the uncle and father of Alphonse de Lamartine\r\nare so pathetic, and give us so vivid a picture of family life\r\nbefore the First Revolution, that I will go back a generation, and\r\ntell them as much as possible in Lamartine's own words.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather had had six children,--three daughters and three\r\nsons. According to French custom, under the old régime, the eldest\r\nson only was to marry, and the other members of the Lamartine family\r\nproceeded as they grew up to fulfil their appointed destinies.\r\nThe second son went into the Church, and rose to be a bishop. The\r\nthird son, M. le Chevalier, went into the army. The sisters adopted\r\nthe religious life, and thus all were provided for. But strange to\r\nsay, the eldest son, to whose happiness and prosperity the rest\r\nwere to be sacrificed, was the first rebel in the family. He fell\r\nin love with a Mademoiselle de Saint-Huruge; but her _dot_ was\r\nnot considered by the elder members of the family sufficient to\r\njustify the alliance. The young man gave up his bride, and to the\r\nconsternation of his relatives announced that he would marry no\r\nother woman. M. le Chevalier must marry and perpetuate the ancestral\r\nline.\r\n\r\nLamartine says,--\r\n\r\n\"M. le Chevalier was the youngest in that generation of our family.\r\nAt sixteen he had entered the regiment in which his father had\r\nserved before him. His career was to grow old in the modest position\r\nof a captain in the army (which position he attained at an early\r\nage), to pass his few months of leave, from time to time, in his\r\nfather's house, to gain the Cross of St. Louis (which was the end\r\nof all ambitions to provincial gentlemen), and then, when he grew\r\nold, being endowed with a small provision from the State, or a\r\nstill smaller revenue of his own, he expected to vegetate in one\r\nof his brothers' old châteaux, having his rooms in the upper story,\r\nto superintend the garden, to shoot with the _curé_, to look after\r\nthe horses, to play with the children, to make up a game of whist\r\nor tric-trac,--the born servant of everyone, a domestic slave,\r\nhappy in his lot, beloved, and yet neglected by all. But in the\r\nend his fate was very different. His elder brother, having refused\r\nto marry, said to his father: 'You must marry the Chevalier.' All\r\nthe feelings of the family and the prejudices of habit rose up in\r\nthe heart of the old nobleman against this suggestion. Chevaliers,\r\naccording to his notions, were not intended to marry. My father\r\nwas sent back to his regiment, and his marrying was put off from\r\nyear to year.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, the idea of marriage having been put into the Chevalier's\r\nhead, he chose for himself, and happily his choice fell on a lady\r\nacceptable to his family. His sister was canoness in an aristocratic\r\norder, whose members were permitted to receive visits from their\r\nbrothers. It was there that he wooed and won the lovely, saint-like\r\nmother of Alphonse de Lamartine.\r\n\r\nThe elder brother, as he advanced in life, kept up a truly affecting\r\nintercourse with Mademoiselle de Saint-Huruge. She was beautiful\r\neven in old age, though her beauty was dimmed by an expression\r\nof sadness. They met every evening in Mâcon, at the house of a\r\nmember of the family, and each entertained till death a pure and\r\nconstant friendship for the other.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that when the Revolution decreed the abolition of all\r\nrights of primogeniture, and ordered each father's fortune to be\r\nequally divided among his children, that M. le Chevalier refused\r\nto take advantage of this new arrangement, and left his share to\r\nthe elder brother, to whom he owed his domestic happiness. In the\r\nend, all the property of the family came to the poet; the aunts and\r\nuncles--the former of whom had been driven from their convents--having\r\nmade him their heir.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lamartine had received part of her education from Madame\r\nde Genlis, and had associated in her childhood with Louis Philippe\r\nand Madame Adélaïde. But though the influence of Madame de Genlis\r\nwas probably not in favor of piety, Madame de Lamartine was sincerely\r\npious. In her son's early education she seems to have been influenced\r\nby Madame de Genlis' admiration of Rousseau. Alphonse ran barefoot\r\non the hills, with the little peasant boys for company; but at\r\nhome he was swayed by the discipline of love. He published nothing\r\ntill he was thirty years of age, though he wrote poetry from early\r\nyouth. His study was in the open air, under some grand old oaks on\r\nthe edge of a deep ravine. In his hands French poetry became for\r\nthe first time musical and descriptive of nature. There was deep\r\nreligious feeling, too, in Lamartine's verse, rather vague as to\r\ndoctrine, but full of genuine religious sentiment. As a Christian\r\npoet he struck a chord which vibrated in many hearts, for the early\r\npart of our century was characterized by faith and by enthusiasm.\r\nScepticism was latent, but was soon to assert itself in weary\r\nindifference. \"As yet, doubt sorrowed that it doubted, and could\r\nfeel the beauty of faith, even when it disbelieved.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 1820 to 1824 Lamartine was a good deal in Italy; after the\r\ndeath of an innocent Italian girl, which he has celebrated in touching\r\nverse, he married an English lady, and had one child, his beloved\r\nJulia. He was made a member of the French Academy, and Charles X.\r\nhad appointed him ambassador to Greece, when the Revolution of 1830\r\noccurred, and he refused to serve under King Charles's successor.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, partly for Julia's health, he visited the Holy Land and\r\nEastern Europe. Poor little Julia died at Beyrout. On the father's\r\nreturn he published his \"Souvenirs of his Journey.\" Books descriptive\r\nof Eastern countries were then rare, and Lamartine's was received\r\nwith enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Lamartine began his political career by entering the Chamber\r\nof Deputies. Some one said of him that he formed a party by himself,--a\r\nparty of one. He pleaded for the abolition of capital punishment,\r\nfor the amelioration of the poorer classes, for the emancipation\r\nof slaves in the colonies, and for various other social reforms;\r\nbut he was never known as a republican.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 he published his \"Histoire des Girondins,\" which was received\r\nby the public with deep interest and applause. It is not always\r\naccurate in small particulars, but it is one of the most fascinating\r\nbooks of history ever written, and has had the good fortune to be\r\nsingularly well translated. Alexandre Dumas is said to have told\r\nits author: \"You have elevated romance to the dignity of history.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the revolution of February, 1848, broke out, Lamartine, being\r\nunwell, did not make his way on the first day through the crowds\r\nto the Chamber of Deputies, nor did he go thither on the second,\r\nlooking on the affair as an _émeute_ likely to be followed only\r\nby a change of ministry. But when news was brought to him which\r\nmade him feel it was a very serious affair, he went at once to the\r\nChamber. On entering, he was seized upon by men of all parties,\r\nbut especially by republicans, who drew him into a side-room and\r\ntold him that the king had abdicated. He had always advocated the\r\nregency of the Duchess of Orleans in the event of Louis Philippe's\r\ndeath, in place of that of the Duc de Nemours. The men who addressed\r\nhim implored him, as the most popular man in France, to put himself\r\nat the head of a movement to make the Duchess of Orleans regent\r\nduring her son's minority, adding that France under a woman and\r\na child would soon drift into a republic. Lamartine sat for some\r\nminutes at a table with his face bowed on his hands. He was praying,\r\nhe says, for light. Then he arose, and after saying that he had\r\nnever been a republican, added that _now_ he was for a republic,\r\nwithout any intermediate regency, either of the duchess or of Nemours.\r\nWith acclamations, the party went back into the Chamber to await\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nWe know already how the duchess was received, and how a mob broke\r\ninto the Chamber. A provisional government was demanded, in the\r\nmidst of indescribable tumult; and by the suffrages of a crowd of\r\nroughs quite as much as by the action of the deputies, a provisional\r\ngovernment of five members (afterwards increased to seven) was\r\nvoted in, the names being written down with a pencil by Lamartine\r\non the spur of the moment. The five men thus nominated and chosen\r\nto be rulers of France were Lamartine, Crémieux, Ledru-Rollin,\r\nGarnier-Pagès, and Arago.\r\n\r\nMeantime in the Hôtel-de-Ville the mob had set up another provisional\r\ngovernment under Socialistic leaders, and the first thing the more\r\ngenuine provisional government had to do was to get rid of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nLamartine says of himself that he felt his mission was to preserve\r\nsociety, and very nobly he set himself to his task. When he and his\r\ncolleagues reached the Hôtel-de-Ville, where the mob was clamoring\r\nfor Socialism and a republic, a compromise had to be effected;\r\nand thus Louis Blanc, the Socialistic reformer, came into the\r\nProvisional Government. It was growing night, and the announcement\r\nof this new arrangement somewhat calmed the crowd; but at midnight\r\nan attack was made on the Hôtel-de-Ville, and the new rulers had to\r\ndefend themselves by personal strength, setting their backs against\r\nthe doors of the Council Chamber, and repelling their assailants\r\nwith their own hands. But the Press and the telegraph were at their\r\ncommand, and by morning the news of the Provisional Government was\r\nspread all over the provinces. \"The mob,\" says Lamartine, \"was\r\nin part composed of galley slaves who had no political ideas in\r\ntheir heads, nor social principles in their hearts, and partly\r\nof that scum which rises to the surface in popular commotions,\r\nand floats between the fumes of intoxication and the thirst for\r\nblood.\"\r\n\r\nLamartine was not a great man, but it was lucky for France, and\r\nfor all Europe, that at this crisis he succeeded in establishing\r\na provisional government, and that he was placed at its head. But\r\nfor him, Paris might have had the Commune in 1848, as she had it\r\nin 1871, but with no great army collected at Versailles to bring\r\nit to subjection.\r\n\r\nFrom such a fate France was saved by the energy and enthusiastic\r\npatriotism of one man, to whom, it seems to me, justice in history\r\nhas hardly yet been done. \"Lamartine was not republican enough\r\nfor republicans; he lost at last his prestige among the people,\r\nand from personal causes the full sympathy of his friends; and his\r\nstar sank before the rising sun of Louis Napoleon.\" Mrs. Oliphant\r\nalso says of him,--\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of his manifold literary labors there happened to\r\nLamartine such a chance as befalls few poets. He had it in his\r\npower, once in his life, to do something greater than the greatest\r\nlyric, more noble than any verse. At the crisis of the Revolution\r\nof 1848, chance (to use the word without irreverence) thrust him,\r\nand no other, into the place of master, and held him for one supreme\r\nmoment alone between France and anarchy,--between, we might almost\r\nsay, the world and another terrible revolution. And then the\r\nsentimentalist proved himself a man. He confronted raving Paris,\r\nand subdued it. The old noble French blood in his veins rose to\r\nthe greatness of the crisis. With a pardonable thrill of pride\r\nin a position so strange to a writer and a man of thought, into\r\nwhich, without any action of his own, he found himself forced,\r\nhe describes how he faced the tumultuous mob of Paris for seventy\r\nhours almost without repose, without sleep, without food, when\r\nthere was no other man in France bold enough or wise enough to\r\ntake that supreme part, and guide that most aimless of revolutions\r\nto a peaceful conclusion,--for the moment, at least. It was not\r\nLamartine's fault that the Empire came after him. Long before the\r\nEmpire came, he had fallen from his momentary elevation, and lost\r\nall influence with his country. But his downfall cannot efface the\r\nfact that he did actually reign, and reign beneficently, subduing\r\nand controlling the excited nation, saving men's lives and the\r\nbalance of society.\"\r\n\r\nThe seventy hours at the Hôtel-de-Ville to which Mrs. Oliphant\r\nalludes were passed by Lamartine in making orations, in sending\r\noff proclamations to the departments, in endeavoring to calm the\r\nexcited multitude and to secure the triumph of the Republic without\r\nthe effusion of blood. The revolution _he_ conducted was, if I may\r\nsay so, the only _respectable_ revolution France has ever known.\r\nNobody expected it, nobody was prepared for it, nobody worked for\r\nit; but the whole country acquiesced in it, and men of all parties,\r\nseeing that it was an accomplished fact, gave in their adhesion\r\nto the Second Republic.\r\n\r\nThere were five great questions that came up before the Provisional\r\nGovernment for immediate solution,--\r\n\r\nThe relation of France to foreign powers.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of the army.\r\n\r\nThe subsistence of working-men out of employment.\r\n\r\nThe property and safety of the exiled royal family.\r\n\r\nAnd, above all, how to meet these expenses and the payment of interest\r\non national bonds, due the middle of March, with assets in the\r\ntreasury of about twenty-five cents in the dollar.\r\n\r\nThese questions were all met by the wonderful energy of Lamartine\r\nand his colleagues, seconded by genuine patriotic efforts throughout\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nLamartine had taken the foreign relations of the new Republic into\r\nhis own hands; and so well did he manage them that not one potentate\r\nof Europe attempted to interfere with the internal affairs of France,\r\nor to dispute the right of the French to establish a republic if\r\nthey thought proper. But although Lamartine's policy was peace,\r\nhe thought France needed a large army both to keep down communism\r\nand anarchy at home, and to show itself strong in the face of all\r\nforeign powers. The army of France in January, 1848, had been about\r\nthree hundred thousand men, of whom one hundred thousand were in\r\nAlgeria; by May it was five hundred thousand, not including the\r\nGarde Mobile, which was of Lamartine's raising. It is well known\r\nhow fiercely boys and very young men fought when any occasion for\r\nfighting was presented in the streets and at the barricades; all\r\nbusiness being stopped in Paris, thousands of these were out of\r\nemployment. Lamartine had them enrolled into his new corps, the\r\nGarde Mobile. Their uniform at first was a red sash and a workman's\r\nblouse. They were proud of themselves and of their new position,\r\nand in May, by dint of discipline, they were transformed into a\r\nfine soldierly body of very young men, who several times rendered\r\nimportant help to the Government in maintaining the cause of order.\r\nThe National Guard was broken up until it could be reorganized,\r\nand so was the Garde Municipale.\r\n\r\nBut how to feed the multitude? Two hundred thousand mechanics alone\r\nwere out of employment in Paris, besides laborers, servants, clerks,\r\netc. It was proposed to establish national workshops in Louis Philippe's\r\npretty private pleasure-grounds, the Parc des Monceaux. The men applying\r\nfor work were enrolled in squads; each squad had its banner and its\r\nofficers, and each man was paid on Saturday night his week's wages,\r\nat the rate of two francs a day,--the highest wages in Paris at that\r\ntime for an artisan. There was no particular work for them to do,\r\nbut the arrangement kept them disciplined and out of mischief, though\r\nat an enormous cost to the country. At the Palace of the Luxembourg\r\nLouis Blanc was permitted to hold a series of great labor meetings,--a\r\nsort of Socialist convention,--and to inveigh against \"capitalists\"\r\nand \"bloated bondholders\" in a style that was much more novel then\r\nthan it is now. Lamartine greatly disapproved of these Luxembourg\r\nproceedings; but he argued that it was better to countenance them\r\nthan to throw Louis Blanc and his friends into open opposition\r\nto the Government. Louis Blanc was a charming writer, whose views\r\non social questions have made great progress since his day. His\r\nbrother Charles wrote a valuable book on art. He himself wrote a\r\n\"History of the Revolution\" and the \"History of Ten Years,\"--that\r\nis, from 1830 to 1840. He bitterly hated Louis Philippe and the\r\n_bourgeoisie_, and yet his book is fair and honest, and the work of\r\na gentleman. He was almost a dwarf, but his face was very handsome,\r\nclean-shaved, with bright eyes and brown hair. I may remark _en\r\npassant_ that not one of the members of the Provisional Government\r\nwore either a beard or a moustache.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things the Provisional Government did was to decree\r\nthat the personal property of the Orleans family should not be\r\nconfiscated, but placed in the hands of a receiver, who should\r\npay the king and princes liberal allowances till it became certain\r\nthat their wealth would not be spent in raising an army for the\r\ninvasion of France.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe lived only two years after reaching England. They\r\nwere apparently not unhappy years to him. He sat at the foot of\r\nhis own table, and carved the joint daily for his guests, children,\r\nand grandchildren. He dictated his Memoirs, and talked with the\r\ngreatest openness to those who wished to converse with him.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Aumale was head of the army in Algeria, and governor-general\r\nof the colony, when the Revolution broke out. Here is the address\r\nwhich he at once published to his soldiers and the people, and\r\nwith which the whole of his after life has been consistent:--\r\n\r\nInhabitants of Algeria! Faithful to my duties as a citizen and a\r\nsoldier, I have remained at my post as long as I could believe my\r\npresence would be useful in the service of my country. It can no\r\nlonger be so. General Cavaignac is appointed governor-general of\r\nAlgeria, and until his arrival here, the functions of governor-general\r\n_ad interim_ will be discharged by General Changarnier. Submissive\r\nto the national will, I depart; but in my place of exile my best\r\nprayers and wishes shall be for the prosperity and glory of France,\r\nwhich I should have wished still longer to serve.\r\n\r\n  H. D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\nThe greatest problem which demanded solution from the Provisional\r\nGovernment was how to make twenty-five cents do the work of a dollar.\r\nThe first Minister of Finance appointed, threw up his portfolio\r\nin despair. Lamartine refused to sanction any arbitrary means of\r\nraising money. At last, by giving some especial privileges and\r\nprotection to the Bank of France, and by mortgaging the national\r\nforests, a sufficient sum was provided for immediate needs. The\r\npeople, too, throughout the provinces, made it a point of honor to\r\ncome forward and pay their taxes before they were due. The priests\r\npreached this as a duty, for the priests were well disposed towards\r\nthe Revolution of 1848. Lamartine had put forth a proclamation\r\nassuring priests and people that his Government was in sympathy\r\nwith religion.\r\n\r\nIn the Provisional Government itself there were two, if not three,\r\nparties,--the party of order, headed by Lamartine; the Socialists,\r\nor labor party, headed by Louis Blanc; and the Red Republicans, or\r\nAnarchists, headed by Ledru-Rollin. The latter was for adopting\r\nthe policy of putting out of office all men who had not been always\r\nrepublicans. Lamartine, on the contrary, said that any man who\r\nloved France and desired to serve her was not incapacitated from\r\ndoing so by previous political opinions.\r\n\r\nElections for a Constitutional Assembly, which was to confirm or\r\nto repudiate the Provisional Government, were held on March 24, and\r\nthe new Assembly was to meet early in May. Meantime all kinds of\r\nduties and anxieties accumulated on Lamartine. The Polish, Hungarian,\r\nSpanish, German, and Italian exiles in Paris were all anxious that\r\nhe should espouse their causes against their own Governments. He\r\nassured them that this was not the mission of the Second French\r\nRepublic, whatever might have been that of the First, and that\r\nthe cause of European liberty would lose, not gain, if France,\r\nwith propagandist fervor, embroiled herself with the monarchical\r\npowers. A deputation of Irishmen, under Smith O'Brien, waited upon\r\nhim to beg the assistance of fifty thousand French troops in Ireland,\r\n\"to rid her of the English.\" Lamartine peremptorily refused, saying:\r\n\"When one is not united by blood to a people, it is not allowable to\r\ninterfere in its affairs with the strong hand.\" Smith O'Brien and\r\nhis followers, deeply mortified, repaired at once to Ledru-Rollin's\r\nRed Republican Club, where they were loudly applauded, and Lamartine\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\nMeantime there were disturbances everywhere. Men out of employment,\r\nexcited by club orators, were ready for any violence. At Lyons they\r\ndestroyed the hospitals and orphan asylums, out of mere wantonness.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Lamartine received news that the soldiers at the\r\nInvalides, dissatisfied with General Petit, their commander, had\r\ndragged him to the street, placed him on a cart, and were carrying\r\nhim thus around Paris. On foot he rushed to the rescue, trusting\r\nto his powers of haranguing the multitude; but luckily the general\r\nhad been released before his arrival. There is but one step from\r\nthe sublime to the ridiculous. We smile at the spectacle of the\r\nruler of France rushing on foot, through dim streets, after a cart\r\nhe could not find. General Petit was that officer of the Old Guard\r\nwhom Napoleon had embraced when he took leave of his beloved corps\r\nat Fontainebleau. Lamartine re-established him as commander at\r\nthe Invalides, and the mutiny was put down.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the first day of the Provisional Government, a mob\r\nhaving demanded that the red flag of Communism should be substituted\r\nfor the tricolor, Lamartine replied,--\r\n\r\n\"Citizens! neither I nor any member of the Government will adopt\r\nthe Drapeau Rouge. We would rather adopt that other flag which is\r\nhoisted in a bombarded city to mark to the enemy the hospitals\r\nof the wounded. I will tell you in one word why I will oppose the\r\nred flag with the whole force of patriotic determination. It is,\r\ncitizens, because the tricolor has made the tour of the world with\r\nthe Republic and the Empire, with your liberties and your glory;\r\nthe red flag has only made the tour of the Champ de Mars, dragged\r\nthrough the blood of citizens.\"\r\n\r\nMuskets in the crowd were here levelled at the speaker, but were\r\nknocked up by the more peaceable of his hearers.\r\n\r\nThere was soon great discontent throughout the departments because\r\nof the imposition of a land-tax; but as Lamartine said truly, farmers\r\nwould have found war or the triumph of Red Republicanism more expensive\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nOn March 17, about three weeks after the departure of the king, a\r\ngreat Socialist demonstration was made in Paris. Large columns of\r\nmen marched to the Hôtel-de-Ville, singing the old revolutionary\r\nchant of \"Ça ira.\" Ledru-Rollin, in the fulness of his heart, seeing\r\nthese one hundred and twenty thousand men all marching with some\r\ndiscipline, said to his colleagues in the Council Chamber: \"Do\r\nyou know that your popularity is nothing to mine? I have but to\r\nopen this window and call upon these men, and you would every one\r\nof you be turned into the street. Do you wish me to try it?\"\r\n\r\nUpon this, Garnier-Pagès, the Finance Minister, walked up to\r\nLedru-Rollin, and presenting a pistol, said: \"If you make one step\r\ntoward that window, it shall be your last.\" Ledru-Rollin paused\r\na moment, and then sat down.\r\n\r\nThe object of the demonstration was to force the Provisional Government\r\nto take measures for raising and equalizing wages, and providing\r\nState employment for all out of employ. The main body was refused\r\nadmittance into the Hôtel-de-Ville, but a certain number of the\r\nleaders were permitted to address the Provisional Government. To\r\nLedru-Rollin's and Louis Blanc's surprise, they found that half\r\nof these leaders were men they had never seen before, more radical\r\nradicals than themselves,--that revolutionary scum that rose to\r\nthe surface in the Reign of Terror and the Commune.\r\n\r\nA sense of common danger made Ledru-Rollin and Louis Blanc unite\r\nwith their colleagues in refusing the demand of the deputation that\r\nthe measures they advocated should be put in force by immediate\r\ndecrees. Lamartine harangued them; so did Ledru-Rollin and Louis\r\nBlanc; and at last the disappointed multitude, with vengeance in\r\ntheir hearts, filed peaceably away.\r\n\r\nA month later, April 15, another outbreak was planned. The chief\r\nclub leaders wished it to be headed by Ledru-Rollin and Blanqui,--the\r\nlatter a conspirator in Louis Philippe's time. But Ledru-Rollin\r\nrefused to serve with Blanqui, having discovered from documents\r\nin his office (that of Minister of Justice) that Blanqui had once\r\nbeen a Government spy. \"Well, then,\" said the club leaders, \"since\r\nyou decline to be our chief, you shall to-morrow share the fate\r\nof your colleagues.\" Ledru-Rollin, after a terrible night of\r\nvacillation, resolved to throw himself on Lamartine's generosity.\r\nHe went to him at daybreak and told him of the impending danger.\r\nAt once Lamartine sent him to call out the National Guard, while\r\nhe himself summoned the Garde Mobile. The National Guard had been\r\nreorganized; but there were no regular soldiers in Paris,--they had\r\nbeen sent away to satisfy the people. The commander of the National\r\nGuard, however, refused to let his men be called out on the occasion;\r\nand Lamartine, on hearing this, went to the Hôtel-de-Ville alone. But\r\nhelp came to him from an unexpected quarter. General Changarnier,\r\nwho had been appointed ambassador to Berlin, called at Lamartine's\r\nhouse to return thanks for his appointment. Madame de Lamartine\r\ntold him of the danger that menaced her husband, and he repaired\r\nat once to the Hôtel-de-Ville. There he found only about twelve\r\nhundred boys of the Garde Mobile to oppose the expected two hundred\r\nthousand insurgents. He drew his Garde Mobile into the building,\r\nand prepared to stand a siege. There from early morning till the\r\nnext day Lamartine remained with Marrast, the Mayor of Paris. He\r\nsays that he harangued the mob from thirty to forty times. The other\r\nmembers of the Government remained in one of the public offices. With\r\nmuch difficulty the National Guard, whose organization was not yet\r\ncomplete, was brought upon the scene. The procession of the insurgents\r\nwas cut in two, the commander of the National Guard employing the\r\nsame tactics as those which the Duke of Wellington had used a week\r\nearlier, when dealing in London with the Chartist procession. The\r\nresult was the complete discomfiture of the insurgents.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards the members of the Provisional Government\r\nsat twelve hours, on thrones erected for them under the Arch of\r\nTriumph, to see Gardes Mobiles, National Guards, troops of the\r\nline, and armed workmen, file past them, all shouting for Lamartine\r\nand Order! It was probably the proudest moment of Lamartine's life;\r\nin that flood-tide of his popularity he easily could have seized\r\nsupreme power.\r\n\r\nAll through the provinces disturbances went on. The object of the\r\nRed Republicans had at first been to oppose the election of the\r\nNational Assembly. So long as France remained under the provisional\r\ndictatorship of Lamartine and his colleagues, and the regular troops\r\nwere kept out of Paris, they hoped to be able to seize supreme\r\npower, by a _coup de main_.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly was, however, elected on Easter Day, and\r\nproved to be largely conservative. The deputies met May 4,--the\r\nanniversary of the meeting of the States-General in 1789, fifty-nine\r\nyears before. Its hall was a temporary structure, erected in the\r\ncourtyard of the Palais Bourbon, the former place of meeting for\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies. There was no enthusiasm in the body for the\r\nRepublic, and evidently a hostile feeling towards the Provisional\r\nGovernment, which it was disposed to think too much allied with\r\nRed Republicanism.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the Assembly met, the Provisional Government resigned\r\nits powers. To Lamartine's great chagrin, he stood, not first, but\r\nfourth, on a list of five men chosen temporarily to conduct the\r\ngovernment. Some of his proceedings had made the Assembly fear\r\n(very unjustly) that he shared the revolutionary enthusiasms of\r\nLedru-Rollin.\r\n\r\nIt was soon apparent that ultra-democracy in France was not favored\r\nby the majority of Frenchmen. The Socialists and Anarchists, finding\r\nthat they could not form a tyrant majority in the Assembly, began\r\nto conspire against it. While a debate was going on ten days after\r\nit assembled, an alarm was raised that a fierce crowd was about\r\nto pour into its place of meeting. Lamartine harangued the mob,\r\nbut this time without effect. His day was over. He was received\r\nwith shouts of \"You have played long enough upon the lyre! _A bas_\r\nLamartine!\" Ledru-Rollin tried to harangue in his turn, but with\r\nno better effect. The hall was invaded, and Lamartine, throwing\r\nup his arms, cried, \"All is lost!\"\r\n\r\nBarbès, the man who led an _emeute_ in 1839, and whose life had\r\nbeen spared by Louis Philippe through the exertions of Lamartine,\r\nled the insurgents. They demanded two things,--a forced tax of\r\na milliard (that is, a thousand million) of francs, to be laid\r\non the rich for the benefit of the poor; and that whoever gave\r\norders to call out the National Guard against insurgents should\r\nbe declared a traitor. \"You are wrong, Barbès,\" cried a voice from\r\nthe crowd; \"two hours' sack of Paris is what we want.\" After this\r\nthe president of the Assembly was pulled from his chair, and a new\r\nprovisional government was nominated of fierce Red Republicans,--not\r\nred enough, however, for the crowd, which demanded Socialists and\r\nAnarchists redder still. By this time some battalions of the National\r\nGuard had been called out. At sight of their bayonets the insurgents\r\nfled, but concentrated their forces on the Hôtel-de-Ville. This\r\nagain they evacuated when cannon were pointed against it, and the\r\ncause of order was won.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cavaignac, who had just come home from Algeria, was made\r\nWar Minister, and the clubs were closed. Louis Blanc was sent into\r\nexile. The Orleans family, which had been treated considerately\r\nby Lamartine, was forbidden to return to France.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly was now dissolved, and a new Chamber of Deputies was\r\nto be chosen in June. Among the candidates for election was Prince\r\nLouis Napoleon. He had already, in the days of Lamartine's\r\nadministration, visited Paris, and had replied to a polite request\r\nfrom the provisional Government that he would speedily leave the\r\ncapital, that any man who would disturb the Provisional Government\r\nwas no true friend to France. Now he professed to ask only to be\r\npermitted to become a representative of the people, saying that he\r\nhad \"not forgotten that Napoleon, before being the first magistrate\r\nin France, was its first citizen.\"\r\n\r\nThen cries of \"Vive l'empereur!\" began to be heard. Louis Napoleon's\r\nearliest \"idea\" had been that France needed an emperor whose throne\r\nshould be based on universal suffrage. To this \"idea\" he added\r\nanother,--that it was _his_ destiny to be the chosen emperor.\r\n\r\nNo one in these days can conceive the hold that the memory of the\r\nFirst Napoleon had, in 1848, on the affections of the French people.\r\nThat he put down anarchy with an iron hand was by the Anarchists\r\nforgotten. He was a son of the Revolution. His marches through\r\nEurope had scattered the seeds of revolutionary ideas. The heart\r\nof France responded to such verses as Béranger's \"Grand'-mère.\" In\r\nvain Lamartine represented the impolicy and unfairness of proscribing\r\nthe Orleans family while admitting into France the head of the house\r\nof Bonaparte. Louis Napoleon was elected deputy by four departments;\r\nbut he subsequently hesitated to take his seat, fearing, he said,\r\nthat he might be the cause of dissension in the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe deputies from Paris were all Socialists, but those from the\r\ndepartments were frequently men of note and reputation. The country\r\nmembers were nearly all friends to order and conservatism.\r\n\r\nThe first necessary measure was to get rid of the national workshops.\r\nOn June 20, one hundred and twenty thousand workmen were being paid\r\ndaily two francs each, only two thousand of whom had anything to\r\ndo, while fifty thousand more were clamoring for admission.\r\n\r\nOf course any measure to suppress the national workshops, or to\r\nsend home those who had come up to Paris for employment in them, was\r\nopposed by the workmen. It was computed that among those employed,\r\nor rather paid, by the State for doing nothing, were twenty-five\r\nthousand desperate men, ready for any fight, and that half this\r\nnumber were ex-convicts. The Government had nominally large forces\r\nat its command, but it was doubtful how far its troops could be\r\nrelied on.\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 1848, at nightfall the struggle began. By morning half\r\nParis was covered with barricades. It was very hard to collect\r\ntroops, but Cavaignac was a tried soldier. He divided his little\r\nforce into four parts. It was not till the evening of the 23d that\r\nhostilities commenced, and at the same time General Cavaignac was\r\nnamed by the Assembly dictator. This inspired confidence. Cavaignac\r\nwas well supported, and acted with the greatest energy. The\r\nstreet-fighting was fiercer than any Paris had ever seen, and no\r\nreal success was gained by Cavaignac till the evening of the 24th,\r\nafter twenty-four hours of hard fighting. That success was the\r\nstorming of the church of Sainte Geneviève (called also the Panthéon)\r\nand the destruction of its walls. But still the fight went on.\r\nMany generals were wounded. Cavaignac used his cannon freely, and\r\neven his bombs. It was night on June 26 before the troops could\r\nbe pronounced victorious, and then they had not stormed the most\r\nformidable of the barricades,--that of the Rue du Faubourg\r\nSaint-Antoine. Says Sir Archibald Alison,--\r\n\r\n\"But ere the attack on this barricade commenced, a sublime instance\r\nof Christian heroism and devotion occurred, which shines forth\r\nlike a heavenly glory in the midst of these terrible scenes of\r\ncarnage. Monseigneur Affre, archbishop of Paris, horror-stricken\r\nwith the slaughter which for three days had been going on, resolved\r\nto attempt a reconciliation between the contending parties, or\r\nperish in the attempt. Having obtained leave from General Cavaignac\r\nto repair to the headquarters of the insurgents, he set out, dressed\r\nin his pontifical robes, having the cross in his hand, attended\r\nby his two chaplains, also in full canonicals, and three intrepid\r\nmembers of the Assembly. Deeply affected by this courageous act,\r\nwhich they knew was almost certain death, the people, as he walked\r\nthrough the streets, fell on their knees and besought him to desist;\r\nbut he persisted, saying, 'It is my duty; a good shepherd giveth\r\nhis life for the sheep.' At seven in the evening he arrived at the\r\nPlace de la Bastille, where the fire of musketry was extremely warm\r\non both sides. It ceased on either side at the august spectacle,\r\nand the archbishop, bearing the cross aloft, advanced with his two\r\npriests to the foot of the barricade. A single attendant, bearing\r\na green branch, preceded the prelate. The soldiers, seeing him\r\nadvance so close to those who had already slain bearers of\r\nflags-of-truce, approached in order to give him succor in case of\r\nneed; the insurgents, on their side, descended the barricade, and\r\nthe redoubtable combatants stood close to each other, exchanging\r\nlooks of defiance. Suddenly a shot was heard. Instantly the cry\r\narose of 'Treason! Treason!' and the combatants, retreating on\r\neither side, began to exchange shots with as much fury as ever.\r\nUndismayed by the storm of balls which incessantly flew over his\r\nhead from all quarters, the prelate advanced slowly, attended by\r\nhis chaplains, to the summit of the barricade. One of them had\r\nhis hat pierced by three balls, but the archbishop himself, almost\r\nby a miracle, escaped while on the top. He had descended three\r\nsteps on the other side, when he was pierced through the loins by\r\na shot from a window. The insurgents, horror-struck, approached\r\nhim where he fell, stanched the wound, which at once was seen to\r\nbe mortal, and carried him to a neighboring hospital. When told\r\nthat he had only a few minutes to live, 'God be praised!' he said,\r\n'and may He accept my life as an expiation for my omissions during\r\nmy episcopacy, and as an offering for the salvation of this misguided\r\npeople.' With these words he expired.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the archbishop's death was known, the insurgents made\r\nproposals to capitulate, on condition of a general pardon. This\r\nCavaignac refused, saying that they must surrender unconditionally.\r\nThe fight therefore lasted until daybreak. Then the insurgents\r\ncapitulated, and all was over.\r\n\r\nNo one ever knew how many fell. Six generals were killed or mortally\r\nwounded. Ten thousand bodies were recognized and buried, and it is\r\nsaid that nearly as many more were thrown unclaimed into the Seine.\r\nThere were fifteen thousand prisoners, of whom three thousand died\r\nof jail-fever. Thousands were sent to Cayenne; thousands to the\r\ngalleys. This terrible four days' fight cost France more lives\r\nthan any battle of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection being over, and Cavaignac dictator, the next thing\r\nwas for the Assembly to make a constitution. This constitution was\r\nshort-lived. A president was to be chosen for four years, with\r\nre-election as often as might be desired. He was to be elected by\r\nuniversal suffrage. He was to have a salary of about one hundred\r\nand twenty-five thousand dollars per annum, and he was to have\r\nmuch the same powers as the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere were two principal presidential candidates,--Prince Louis\r\nNapoleon, who had taken his seat in the Assembly; and Cavaignac,\r\nwho had the power of Government on his side, and was sanguine of\r\nelection. The prince proclaimed in letters and placards his deep\r\nattachment to the Republic, and denounced as his enemies and slanderers\r\nall those who said he was not firmly resolved to maintain the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election showed Louis Napoleon to have had five\r\nand a half millions of votes; Cavaignac one and a half million;\r\nLamartine, who six months before had been a popular idol, had nineteen\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _LOUIS NAPOLEON._ (The Prince President.)]\r\n\r\nAn early friend of Louis Napoleon, who seems to have been willing\r\nto talk freely of the playmate of her childhood, thus spoke of\r\nhim to an English traveller.\r\n\r\n\"He is,\" she said, \"a strange being. His mind wants _keeping_.\r\nA trifle close to his eyes hides from him large objects at a\r\ndistance.... The great progress in political knowledge made by\r\nthe higher classes in France from 1815 to 1848 is lost on him.\r\nWhen we met in 1836, after three years' separation, I was struck\r\nby his backwardness in political knowledge. Up to 1848 he never\r\nhad lived in France except as a child or a captive. His opinions\r\nand feelings were those of the French masses from 1799 to 1812.\r\nThough these opinions had been modified in the minds of the higher\r\nclasses, they were, in 1848, those of the multitude, who despise\r\nparliamentary government, despise the pope, despise the priests,\r\ndelight in profuse expenditure, delight in war, hold the Rhine to\r\nbe our national frontier, and that it is our duty to seize all\r\nthat lies on the French side. The people and he were of one mind. I\r\nhave no doubt that the little he may have heard, and the less that\r\nhe attended to, from the persons he saw between 1848 and 1852 about\r\nliberty, self-government, economy, the supremacy of the Assembly,\r\nrespect for foreign nations, and fidelity to treaties, appeared\r\nto him the silliest talk imaginable. So it would have appeared\r\nto all in the lower classes of France; so it would have appeared\r\nto the army, which is drawn from those classes, and exaggerates\r\ntheir political views.\"\r\n\r\n\"The prince president is romantic, impulsive, and _bizarre_,\" said\r\none of his officials to the same English gentleman, \"indolent, vain,\r\ngood-natured, selfish, fearing and disliking his superiors;...\r\nhe loves to excite the astonishment of the populace. As a child\r\nhe liked best bad children,--as a man, bad men.\"\r\n\r\nBut one good quality he had pre-eminently,--no man was ever more\r\ngrateful for kindness, or more indulgent to his friends.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man, untried, uneducated in French politics, covered\r\nwith ridicule, and even of doubtful courage, whom the voices of\r\nfive and a half millions of French voters called to the presidential\r\nchair. It was to the country Louis Napoleon had appealed, to the\r\nrural population of France as against the dangerous classes in the\r\ngreat cities. Paris had for sixty years been making revolutions\r\nfor the country; now it was the turn of the provincials, who said\r\nthey were tired of receiving a new Government by mail whenever it\r\npleased the Parisians to make one. Paris contained one hundred and\r\nforty thousand Socialists, besides Anarchists and Red Republicans.\r\nWith these the rural population had no sympathy. Louis Napoleon was\r\nnot chosen by their votes, nor by those of their sympathizers in\r\nother great cities. His success was in the rural districts alone.\r\n\r\nHis election was a great disappointment to the Assembly, and from\r\nthe first moment the prince president and that body were antagonistic\r\nto each other. The president claimed to hold his powers from the\r\npeople, and to be in no way under the control of the Assembly;\r\nthe Assembly was forever talking of deposing him, of imprisoning\r\nhim at Vincennes, and so on.\r\n\r\nImmediately after his election the prince president found it very\r\ndifficult to form a cabinet. After being repulsed in various quarters,\r\nhe sent a confidential messenger to Lamartine, asking him to meet him\r\nby night on horseback in a dark alley in the Bois de Boulogne. After\r\nlistening to his rival's appeal for assistance in this emergency,\r\nLamartine frankly told him that for various reasons he felt himself\r\nto be not only the most useless, but the most dangerous minister a\r\nnew Government could select. He said, \"I should ruin myself without\r\nserving you.\" The prince seemed grieved. \"With regard to popularity,\"\r\nhe answered, with a smile, \"I have enough for both of us.\" \"I know it,\"\r\nreplied Lamartine; \"but having, as I think, given you unanswerable\r\nreasons for my refusal, I give you my word of honor that if by\r\nto-morrow you have not been able to win over and to rally to you\r\nthe men I will name, I will accept the post of prime minister in\r\ndefault of others.\"\r\n\r\nBefore morning the prince president had succeeded elsewhere; but\r\nhe retained a sincere respect and regard for Lamartine, who after\r\nthis incident fades out of the page of history. He lived a few\r\nyears longer; but he was oppressed by pecuniary difficulties, from\r\nwhich neither his literary industry, nor the assistance of the\r\nGovernment, nor the subscriptions of his friends, seemed able to\r\nextricate him. Several times Milly, the dear home of his childhood,\r\nwas put up for sale by his creditors. It was more than once rescued\r\non his behalf, but in the end was sold.\r\n\r\nLamartine was buried with national honors; but among all the chances\r\nand changes that have distracted the attention of his countrymen\r\nfrom his career, he does not seem to have received from the world\r\nor the French nation all the honor, praise, and gratitude that\r\nhis memory deserves.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon, who had all his life dreamed of being the French\r\nemperor, though he took care to repudiate such an idea in all his\r\npublic speeches, had not been president of the Republic six weeks\r\nbefore he read a plan for a _coup d'état_ to General Changarnier,\r\nwho utterly refused to listen to it.\r\n\r\nWe need not here dwell on the struggles that went on between the\r\nprince president and the Assembly, from December, 1848, to November,\r\n1851. It is enough to say that the Chamber, from being the governing\r\npower in France, found itself reduced to a mere legislative body\r\nmuch hampered by the mistrust and contempt of the Executive. Its\r\nmembers of course hated \"the Man at the Élysée,\" or \"Celui-ci,\"\r\nas they called him. The Socialists hated the Assembly even more\r\nthan they hated the president. The army was all for him. The\r\n_bourgeoisie_ were thankful that under his rule they might at least\r\nfind protection from Socialism and anarchy.\r\n\r\nFrom the election of Prince Louis to the _coup d'état_ in December,\r\n1851, there were four serious _émeutes_ in Paris, and once the\r\ncity was in a state of siege. It was estimated that to put down\r\nthe smallest of these revolts cost two hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nForeign nations were too busy with their own affairs in 1848 to\r\nhave time to meddle with the Government of Louis Napoleon,--indeed,\r\nRussia and Prussia were much obliged to him for keeping out the\r\nOrleans family, whom they by no means wished to see on the French\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nOne thing that Louis Napoleon did to gain favor with the country\r\nparty caused great indignation among genuine republicans, and,\r\nindeed, throughout Europe. This was the part he took against the\r\nRepublic of Rome.\r\n\r\nPio Nono, having been elected pope in 1846, had started on his\r\ncareer as a liberal pontiff and ruler; but before 1848 he had\r\ndisappointed the expectations of all parties, and had fled from\r\nRome to Gaeta, where Ferdinand, king of the Two Sicilies (commonly\r\nknown as King Bomba) had also taken refuge. Lamartine, at the time\r\nhis power ceased, had been fitting out a French army to lend help\r\nto the Romans if they should be attacked by the Austrians, and if\r\nneed were, to protect the pope, who before his flight was supposed\r\nto be opposed to Austrian domination. Louis Napoleon ordered General\r\nOudinot, who commanded the French forces, to disembark his troops at\r\nCivita Vecchia, and either to occupy Rome peaceably, or to attack\r\nthe revolutionists. A battle was fought, and the French worsted;\r\nbut they ended by gaining the city and holding it, putting down\r\nthe Roman republicans, and handing the city over to Austrian and\r\npapal vengeance on Pio Nono's return.\r\n\r\nThe new president, anxious to strengthen his popularity in the\r\nprovinces, made several tours. Everywhere, as the nephew of his\r\nuncle, he was received with wild enthusiasm. He was not a man to\r\ncaptivate by his manners on public occasions, neither was he a\r\nready speaker; but he looked his best on horseback, and above all,\r\nthere was in his favor, among the middle class of Frenchmen, a\r\nvery potent feeling,--the dread of change.\r\n\r\nAs a deputy, before his election by the country as its president,\r\nhe used to sit in the Chamber silent and alone, pitied by some, and\r\nneglected by all. Silence, indeed, was necessary to his success, for,\r\n\"silent and smoking, he matured his plans.\" One of the first things\r\nhe did when he became president was to attempt to get possession of\r\nall papers in the archives concerning his conduct at Strasburg\r\nand Boulogne.\r\n\r\nThere had been a new Assembly elected. It had few of the old republican\r\nleaders in it, but the Left and the Right and half the Centre were\r\nopposed to the prince president. The Left in the French Chamber\r\nmeans the Red Republicans; the Right, those members who are in\r\nfavor of monarchy; the Centre, the Moderates, who are willing to\r\naccept any good government.\r\n\r\nOne of the objects of this Assembly, which foresaw that a _coup\r\nd'état_ might be at hand, was to get command of a little army for\r\nits own protection. It appointed as commander of this force General\r\nChangarnier, with whom the prince president had recently quarrelled,\r\nand designated four of its members, whom it called _quoestors_, to\r\nlook into all matters relating to its safety.\r\n\r\nThe constitution was to be revised by this Assembly. Nobody cared\r\nmuch about the constitution, which had not had time to acquire any\r\nhold on the affections of the people, and Louis Napoleon had recently\r\nacquired popularity with the turbulent part of the population of Paris\r\nby opposing a measure calculated to restrict universal suffrage, and\r\nto prevent tramps, aliens, and ex-convicts from voting at elections.\r\nThe prince president, who wanted, for his own purposes, as large\r\na popular vote as possible, was opposed to any restrictions on\r\nthe suffrage.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of things on Nov. 26, 1851, when Louis Napoleon\r\nsummoned the principal generals and colonels of the troops in and\r\naround Paris to meet him at the Élysée. At this meeting they all\r\nswore to support the president if called upon to do so, and never\r\nto tell of this engagement. They kept the secret for five years.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Assembly on its part was hatching a conspiracy to\r\noverturn the president and send him to a dungeon at Vincennes;\r\nwhile all who refused to support its authority were to be declared\r\nguilty of treason.\r\n\r\nThe three men called the generals of the Army of Africa,--namely,\r\nCavaignac, Changarnier, and Lamoricière,--were opposed to the prince\r\npresident. They were either Republicans or Orleanists.\r\n\r\nThus the crisis approached. Each party was ready to spring upon\r\nthe other. Again France was to experience a political convulsion,\r\nand the party that moved first would gain the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE COUP D'ÉTAT.\r\n\r\n\"In voting for Louis Napoleon,\" says Alison, \"the French rural\r\npopulation understood that it was voting for an emperor and for\r\nthe repression of the clubs in Paris. It seemed to Frenchmen in\r\nthe country that they had only a choice between Jacobin rule by\r\nthe clubs, or Napoleonic rule by an emperor.\" So, though Louis\r\nNapoleon, when he presented himself as a presidential candidate,\r\nassured the electors, \"I am not so ambitious as to dream of empire,\r\nof war, nor of subversive theories; educated in free countries\r\nand in the school of misfortune, I shall always remain faithful\r\nto the duties that your suffrages impose on me,\" public sentiment\r\nabroad and at home, whether hostile or favorable, expected that\r\nhe would before long make himself virtually, if not in name, the\r\nEmperor Napoleon. Indeed, the army was encouraged by its officers\r\nto shout, \"Vive l'empereur!\" and \"Vive Napoleon!\" And General\r\nChangarnier, for disapproving of these demonstrations, had been\r\ndismissed from his post as military commander at the capital. He\r\nwas forthwith, as we have seen, appointed to a military command\r\nin the confidence of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nBy the autumn of 1851 Louis Napoleon had fully made up his mind\r\nas to his _coup d'état_, and had arranged all its details. He had\r\nfive intimates, who were his counsellors,--De Morny, De Maupas,\r\nDe Persigny, Fleury, and General Saint-Arnaud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _DUC DE MORNY._]\r\n\r\nDe Morny has always been reputed to have been the half-brother of\r\nLouis Napoleon. In 1847 he lived luxuriously in a small _hôtel_\r\nin the Champs Elysées, surrounded by rare and costly works of art.\r\nHe had then never been considered anything but a man of fashion;\r\nbut he proved well fitted to keep secrets, to conduct plots, and\r\nto do the cruellest things in a jocund, off-hand way.\r\n\r\nSaint-Arnaud's name had been originally Jacques Le Roy. At one\r\ntime, under the name of Florival, he had been an actor in Paris\r\nat one of the suburban theatres. He had served three times in the\r\nFrench army, and been twice dismissed for conduct unbecoming an\r\nofficer. His third term of service for his country was in a foreign\r\nlegion, composed of dare-devils of all nations, who enrolled themselves\r\nin the army of Algeria. There his brilliant bravery had a large\r\nshare in securing the capture of Constantine. He rose rapidly to\r\nbe a general, was an excellent administrator, a cultivated and\r\nagreeable companion, perfectly unscrupulous, and ready to assist\r\nin any scheme of what he considered _necessary_ cruelty. Fleury,\r\nwho had been sent to Africa to select a military chief fitted to\r\ncarry out the _coup d'état_, found Saint-Arnaud the very man to\r\nsuit the purpose of his master. Saint-Arnaud was tall, thin, and\r\nbony, with close-cropped hair. De Morny used to laugh behind his\r\nback at the way he said _le peuple souvérain_, and said he knew\r\nas little about the sovereign people as about the pronunciation.\r\nHe spoke English well, for he had lived for some years an exile\r\nin Leicester Square,--the disreputable French quarter of London;\r\nthis accomplishment was of great service to him during the Crimean\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nDe Maupas had been a country prefect, and was eager for promotion.\r\nLouis Napoleon converted him into his Minister of Police.\r\n\r\nFleury was the simple-hearted and attached friend of his master.\r\n\r\nDe Persigny, like Saint-Arnaud, had changed his name, having begun\r\nlife as Fialin.\r\n\r\nThese five plotted the _coup d'état_[1]; arranged all its details,\r\nand kept their own counsel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: De Maupas, Le Coup d'Etat.]\r\n\r\nThe generals and colonels in garrison in Paris had been sounded,\r\nas we have seen, in reference to their allegiance to the Great\r\nEmperor's nephew, and by the close of 1851 all things had been made\r\nready for the proposed _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\nA _coup d'état_ is much the same thing as a _coup de main_,--with\r\nthis difference, that in the political _coup de main_ it is the\r\nmob that takes the initiative, in the _coup d'état_ the Government;\r\nand the Government generally has the army on its side.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon and his five associates were about to do the most\r\naudacious thing in modern history; but no man can deny them the praise\r\nawarded to the unjust steward. If the thing was to be done, or, in\r\nthe language of Victor Hugo, if the _crime_ was to be committed,\r\nit could not have been more admirably planned or more skilfully\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nThe world, to all appearance, went on in its usual way. The Assembly,\r\non December 1, 1851, was busy discussing the project of a railroad\r\nto Lyons. That evening M. de Morny was at the Opéra Comique in\r\ncompany with General Changarnier, and the prince president was\r\ndoing the honors as usual in his reception-room at the Élysée. His\r\nvisage was as calm, his manners were as conciliatory and affable,\r\nas usual. No symptoms of anything extraordinary were to be seen,\r\nand an approaching municipal election in Paris accounted for the\r\narrival of several _estafettes_ and couriers, which from time to\r\ntime called the prince president from the room. When the company\r\nhad taken leave, Saint-Arnaud, Maupas, Morny, and a colonel on\r\nthe staff went with the prince president into his smoking-room,\r\nwhere the duties of each were assigned to him. Everything was to be\r\ndone by clock-work. Exactly at the hour appointed, all the African\r\ngenerals and several of their friends were to be arrested. Exactly\r\nat the moment indicated, troops were to move into position. At so\r\nmany minutes past six A. M. all the printing-offices were to be\r\nsurrounded. Every man who had in any way been prominent in politics\r\nsince the days of Louis Philippe was to be put under arrest.\r\n\r\nBy seven o'clock in the morning all this had been accomplished.\r\nThe Parisians awoke to find their walls placarded by proclamations\r\nsigned by Prince Louis Napoleon as President, De Morny as Minister\r\nof the Interior, De Maupas as Prefect of Police, and Saint-Arnaud\r\nas Minister of War.\r\n\r\nThese proclamations announced,--\r\n\r\n    I. The dissolution of the Assembly.\r\n   II. The restoration of universal suffrage.\r\n  III. A general election on December 14.\r\n   IV. The dissolution of the Council of State.\r\n    V. That Paris was in a state of siege.\r\n\r\nThis last meant that any man might be arrested, without warrant,\r\nat the pleasure of the police.\r\n\r\nAnother placard forbade any printer, on pain of death, to print\r\nany placard not authorized by Government; and death likewise was\r\nannounced for anyone who tore down a Government placard.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon followed this up by an appeal to the people. He said\r\nhe wished the people to judge between the Assembly and himself.\r\nIf France would not support him, she must choose another president.\r\nIn place of the constitution of 1848 he proposed one that should\r\nmake the presidential term of office ten years; he also proposed\r\nthat the president's cabinet should be of his own selection.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon had entire confidence that all elections by universal\r\nsuffrage would be in his favor. He had just made extensive tours in\r\nthe provinces, and had been received everywhere with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThus far I have given the historical outline of the story; but if\r\nwe look into Victor Hugo's \"Histoire d'un Crime,\" and disentangle\r\nits facts from its hysterics, we may receive from his personal\r\nnarrative a vivid idea of what passed in Paris from the night of\r\nDec. 1, 1851, to the evening of December 4, when all was over.\r\n\r\nRoused early in the morning by members of the Assembly, who came\r\nto announce the events of the night, Victor Hugo, to whom genuine\r\nrepublicans who were not Socialists looked as a leader, was, like\r\nall the rest of Paris, taken completely by surprise. One of his\r\nvisitors was a working-man, a wood-carver; of him Hugo eagerly\r\nasked: \"What do the working-men--the people--say as they read the\r\nplacards?\" He answered: \"Some say one thing, some another. The\r\nthing has been so done that they cannot understand it. Men going\r\nto their work are reading the placards. Not one in a hundred says\r\nanything, and those who do, say generally, 'Good! Universal suffrage\r\nis reestablished. The conservative majority in the Assembly is\r\ngot rid of,--that's splendid! Thiers is arrested,--better still!\r\nChangarnier is in prison,--bravo!' Beneath every placard there\r\nare men placed to lead the approval. My opinion is that the people\r\nwill approve!\"\r\n\r\nAt exactly six that morning, Cavaignac, Changarnier, Lamoricière,\r\nThiers, and all those who had lain down to sleep as cabinet ministers\r\nof the prince president, were roused from their beds by officers of\r\ncavalry, with orders to dress quickly, for they were under arrest.\r\nBefore each door a hackney-coach was waiting, and an escort of two\r\nhundred Lancers was in a street near by. Resistance seemed useless\r\nin the face of such precautions, but Victor Hugo and his friends were\r\nresolved upon a fight. They put their official scarves as deputies\r\ninto their pockets, and started forth to see if they could raise\r\nthe Faubourg Saint-Antoine. But their friend the wood-carver had\r\ntold them truly,--there was neither sympathy nor enthusiasm in\r\nthe streets for the constitution that had fallen, the deputies\r\nwho had been placed under arrest, nor for violated political\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIn vain they appealed to the people in the name of the law. The\r\nmob seemed to consider that provided it had universal suffrage,\r\nand that the man of its choice were at the head of affairs, it\r\nhad better trust the safety of the nation to one man than risk the\r\nuncertainties that might attend the tyranny of many.\r\n\r\nThe frantic efforts made that day by Victor Hugo and a few other\r\ndeputies of the Left to rouse the populace are almost ludicrous.\r\nVictor Hugo, no doubt, was a brave man, though a very melodramatic\r\none, and he seems to have thought that if he could get the soldiers\r\nto shoot him,--_him_, the greatest literary star of France since\r\nthe death of Voltaire,--the notoriety of his death might rouse\r\nthe population.\r\n\r\nHere is one scene in his narrative. He and three of his friends,\r\nfinding that the Faubourg Saint-Antoine gave no ear to their appeals,\r\nand for once was disinclined to fight, decided to return home,\r\nand took seats in an omnibus which passed them on the Place de la\r\nBastille.\r\n\r\n\"We were all glad to get in,\" says Victor Hugo. \"I took it much\r\nto heart that I had not that morning, when I saw a crowd assembled\r\nround the Porte Saint-Martin, shouted 'To arms!'... The omnibus\r\nstarted. I was sitting at the end on the left, my friend young\r\nArmand was beside me. As the omnibus moved on, the crowd became\r\nmore closely packed upon the Boulevard. When we reached the narrow\r\nascent near the Porte Saint-Martin, a regiment of heavy cavalry\r\nmet us. The men were Cuirassiers. Their horses were in a trot,\r\nand their swords were drawn. All of a sudden the regiment came\r\nto a halt. Something was in their way. Their halt detained the\r\nomnibus. My heart was stirred. Close before me, a yard from me,\r\nwere Frenchmen turned into Mamelukes, citizen-supporters of the\r\nRepublic transformed into the mercenaries of a Second Empire! From\r\nmy seat I could almost put my hand upon them. I could no longer\r\nbear the sight. I let down the glass, I put my head out of the\r\nwindow, and looked steadily at the close line of armed men. Then\r\nI shouted: 'Down with Louis Bonaparte! Those who serve traitors\r\nare traitors!' The nearest soldiers turned their faces towards\r\nme, and looked dazed with astonishment. The rest did not stir.\r\nWhen I shouted, Armand let down his glass and thrust half his body\r\nout of his window, shaking his fist at the soldiers. He too cried\r\nout: 'Down with all traitors!' Our example was contagious. 'Down\r\nwith traitors!' cried my other two friends in the omnibus. 'Down\r\nwith the dictator!' cried a generous young man who sat beside me.\r\nAll the passengers in the omnibus, except this young man, seemed\r\nto be filled with terror. 'Hold your tongues!' they cried; 'you\r\nwill have us all massacred.' The most frightened of them let down\r\nhis glass and shouted to the soldiers: 'Vive le Prince Napoléon!\r\nVive l'empereur!' The soldiers looked at us in solemn silence.\r\nA mounted policeman menaced us with his drawn sword. The crowd\r\nseemed stupefied.... The soldiers had no orders to act, so nothing\r\ncame of it. The regiment started at a gallop, so did the omnibus.\r\nAs long as the Cuirassiers were passing, Armand and I, hanging\r\nhalf out of our windows, continued to shout at them, 'Down with\r\nthe dictator!'\"\r\n\r\nThis foolhardy and melodramatic performance was one of many such\r\nscenes, calculated to turn tragedy into farce.\r\n\r\nMeantime, from early morning the hall of the representatives had\r\nbeen surrounded by soldiers with mortars and cannon. As the deputies\r\narrived they were allowed to pass the gates, but were not permitted\r\nto enter their chamber. Their president, or Speaker, M. Dupin, was\r\nappealed to. He said he could do nothing; it was hopeless to resist\r\nsuch a display of force. At last the representatives, becoming,\r\nas the soldiers put it, \"noisy and troublesome,\" were collared\r\nand turned out into the street. One by one the most excited were\r\narrested. The remainder decided to go to the High Court of Justice\r\nand demand a warrant to depose and arrest the prince president.\r\nBut they could not find the judges; they had hidden themselves\r\naway. When at last they succeeded in discovering the place where\r\nthey were sitting, the police followed closely on their track,\r\nand the judges were forced to shut up their court and march off,\r\nunder a guard of soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe representatives then decided to go to the Mairie of the Tenth\r\nArrondissement, and there reorganize into a legislative body. They\r\nwere nearly all members belonging to the Right, but they were as\r\nindignant as the Left at the outrage.\r\n\r\nThey formed into a column, marching two and two abreast; but the\r\nLeft would not march with the Right, so they proceeded in two parallel\r\ncolumns, one on each side of the way. Arrived at the Mairie, they made\r\nJules de Lasteyrie, Lafayette's grandson, president _pro tempore_, and\r\nproceeded to pass a decree deposing Louis Bonaparte. Scarcely was this\r\ndone when a battalion of cavalry arrived, and the legislators soon\r\nperceived that they were prisoners. After a great deal of altercation\r\nwith the soldiers, they were marched off to a barrack-yard on the\r\nQuai d'Orsay.\r\n\r\nWhen all this was reported to De Morny, he remarked: \"It is well;\r\nbut they are the last deputies who will be made _prisoners_,\"--meaning\r\nthat any others would be shot.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past three when the deputies were locked into the\r\nbarrack-yard. The December day was cold and frosty, the sky overcast.\r\nThe first thing they did was to call the roll. There were two hundred\r\nand twenty of them, out of a total membership of seven hundred\r\nand fifty. Among them were many of the best and most conservative\r\nmen of France. There was Jules Grévy, the future president (M.\r\nThiers was already in prison); Jules de Lasteyrie; Sainte-Beuve,\r\nthe great critic; Berryer, the great lawyer; the Duc de Luynes,\r\nthe richest man in France; and Odillon Barrot, the popular idol\r\nat the commencement of the late revolution. De Tocqueville was\r\nthere, the great writer on America; General Oudinot, and several\r\nother generals; the Duc de Broglie, great-grandson of Madame de\r\nStaël; Eugène Sue, the novelist; Coquerel, the French Protestant\r\npreacher; and M. de Rémusat, the son of that lady who has given\r\nus her experiences of the court of the First Napoleon.\r\n\r\nFor two hours the deputies remained in the open air; then they were\r\ntransferred at dark to the third story of a wing of the barracks.\r\nThey found themselves in two long halls, with low ceilings and dirty\r\nwalls, used as the soldiers' dormitories. They had no furniture but\r\nsome wooden benches. M. de Tocqueville was quite ill. The rooms\r\nwere bitterly cold. An hour or so later, three representatives, who\r\nhad demanded to share the fate of their colleagues, were brought\r\nin. One of these was the Marquis de La Vallette, who had married\r\nMrs. Welles, a very beautiful and fascinating American lady.\r\n\r\nNight came. Most of the prisoners had eaten nothing since morning.\r\nA collection of five francs apiece was taken up amongst them, and\r\na cold collation was provided by a neighboring restaurant. They\r\nate standing, with their plates in their hands. \"Just like a supper\r\nat a ball,\" remarked one of the younger ones. They had very few\r\ndrinking-glasses. Right and Left, having been reconciled by this time,\r\ndrank together. \"Equality and Fraternity!\" remarked a conservative\r\nnobleman as he drank with one of the Red Republicans. \"Ah,\" was\r\nthe answer, \"but not Liberty.\" Eight more prisoners before long\r\nwere added to their number, and three were released,--one because\r\nhe was eighty, one because of his wife's illness, and one because\r\nhe had been accidentally wounded. At last, sixty mattresses were\r\nbrought in, for two hundred and twenty-five men. They had no blankets,\r\nand had to trust to their great-coats to keep them from the cold.\r\nA few of them went to sleep, but were roused at midnight by an\r\norder that their quarters must be changed. They were taken down\r\nby parties to all the _voitures cellulaires_ (or Black Marias)\r\nin Paris. Each deputy was put into a separate cell, where he sat\r\ncramped and freezing for hours. It was nearly seven A. M., December\r\n3, before these prison-vans were ready to start.\r\n\r\nSome went to the great prison of Mazas, some to Vincennes, some\r\nto Fort Valérien. At Mazas they were treated in all respects like\r\ncriminals, except that they were not allowed a daily walk,--a privilege\r\nthe knaves and malefactors obtained. Two deputies only were favored\r\nwith beds,--M. Thiers and another elderly man. M. Grévy had none,\r\nnor the African generals, the ex-dictator Cavaignac among them.\r\n\r\nSuch of the members of the Left as were not in prison spent December\r\n2, 3, and 4 in endeavoring to assemble and reorganize the remains\r\nof the Assembly; but the police followed them up too closely.\r\n\r\nA few barricades were raised, and the first man killed on one of\r\nthem was named Baudin. He threw away his life recklessly and to no\r\npurpose; but it is the fashion among advanced republicans to this\r\nday to decorate his grave and to honor his memory with communistic\r\nspeeches. He was rather a fine young fellow, and might have lived\r\nto do the State some service.\r\n\r\nBy the night of December 3 there was a good deal of commotion in\r\nthe city. Two days of disorganization, idleness, and excitement\r\nhad made workmen more inflammable than when they remained passive\r\nunder the appeals of Victor Hugo. The remainder of the story, so far\r\nas it concerns the uprising and massacre in the streets of Paris,\r\nI will borrow from the experience of an American eye-witness; but\r\nfirst I will tell what happened to the African generals imprisoned\r\nat Mazas.\r\n\r\nOn the night of December 3 the station of the great railroad to\r\nthe north was filled with soldiers. About six o'clock the next\r\nmorning two _voitures cellulaires_ drove up, each attended by a\r\nlight carriage containing an especial agent sent by the police.\r\nThese vehicles, just as they were, were rolled on to trucks, and\r\nthe train moved out of the station. There were eight cells in each\r\n_voiture cellulaire_; four were occupied by prisoners, four by\r\npolicemen. It was bitterly cold, and in the second of the prison-vans\r\nthe police, half frozen, opened the doors of their cells and came\r\nout to walk up and down and warm themselves. Then a voice was heard\r\nfrom one of the prisoners. \"_Ah, ça_, it is bitterly cold here.\r\nCould n't one be allowed to re-light one's cigar?\" At this another\r\nvoice called out: \"_Tiens!_ is that you, Lamoricière? Good morning!\"\r\n\"Good morning, Cavaignac,\" replied the other. Then a third voice\r\ncame from the third cell. It was that of Changarnier. \"_Messieurs\r\nles Généraux_,\" cried a fourth, \"do not forget that I am one of\r\nyou.\" The speaker was a _quoestor_ of the Chamber of Deputies, a\r\nman charged with the safety of the National Assembly. The generals\r\nwho had spoken, and Bedeau, who was in the next van, were, with the\r\nexception of Bugeaud, the four leading commanders in the French\r\narmy. The other four prisoners were Colonel Charras, General Le\r\nFlô, Baze the _quoestor_, and a deputy, Count Roger (_du Nord_).\r\nAt midnight they had been roused from sleep and ordered to dress\r\nimmediately. \"Are we going to be shot?\" asked Charras, but no answer\r\nwas vouchsafed him. They were put into the _voitures cellulaires_,\r\neach knowing nothing of the presence of the others; even the police\r\nwho were in charge of them, had no idea what prisoners they had in\r\ncustody. After this recognition between the generals, they were\r\npermitted to come out of their cells and walk up and down the van\r\nto warm themselves, taking care, however, that they were not seen\r\nat liberty by the special agents in the carriages attending on\r\neach van.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Ham, the former prison of Louis Napoleon, Cavaignac,\r\nwhom he had succeeded as ruler of France, was put into his former\r\nchamber. \"Chassez croissez,\" said De Morny, when the report was\r\nmade to him.\r\n\r\nDecember 4, the last day of the struggle, was by far the most terrible.\r\nLouis Napoleon, in spite of many benefits which France and the world\r\nowe him, will never be cleansed from the stain that the outrages of\r\nthat day have left upon his memory. It may be said, however, that\r\nthe details of the _coup d'état_ were left to his subordinates,\r\nand that probably both success and infamy are due in large part\r\nto the flippant Morny.\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, drizzling day. Such barricades as had been built\r\nwere very slimly defended, and with no enthusiasm. The insurgents\r\nwere short of ammunition, nor did the troops attack them with much\r\nvigor. In fact, the soldiers were but few, for all were being\r\nconcentrated on that part of the Boulevard where strangers do their\r\nshopping and eat ices at Tortoni's. The programme for that day\r\nwas not fighting, but a massacre.\r\n\r\nThe American gentleman whose narrative I am about to quote, says,--\r\n\r\n\"On December 3 there was more excitement in the streets than there\r\nhad been on December 2. The secret societies had got to work. The\r\nReds were recovering from their astonishment. Ex-members of the\r\nNational Assembly had harangued the multitude and circulated addresses\r\ncalculated to rouse the people to resistance. On the 4th there was\r\nnot much stirring. The shops were closed. I went into the heart\r\nof the city on business, where I soon found myself in the midst\r\nof a panic-stricken crowd. The residents were closing their doors\r\nand barricading their windows. Some said the Faubourgs were rising;\r\nsome that the troops were approaching, with cannon.\r\n\r\n\"Hearing there were barricades at the Porte Saint-Denis, I pushed\r\ndirectly for the spot. The work was going on bravely. Stagings had\r\nbeen torn from unfinished houses, iron railings from the magnificent\r\ngateway; trees were cut down, street sheds demolished; carts, carriages,\r\nand omnibuses were being triumphantly dragged from hiding-places\r\nto the monstrous pile. There were not very many men at work, but\r\nthose who were engaged, labored like beavers. Blouses and broadcloth\r\nwere about equally mixed. A few men armed with cutlasses, muskets,\r\nand pistols appeared to act as leaders; soon a search was made\r\nin neighboring houses for arms. I was surprised to see how many\r\nboys were in the ranks of the insurgents. They went to work as if\r\ninsurrection were a frolic. I shuddered as I thought how many of\r\nthem would be shot or bayoneted before night fell. The sentiments\r\nof the spectators seemed different. Some said, 'Let them go ahead.\r\nThey want to plunder and kill: they will soon be taught a good\r\nlesson.' Others encouraged the barricade-makers. One man, hearing\r\nthat I was an American, said with a sigh, 'Ah, you live in a true\r\nrepublic!'\r\n\r\n\"After remaining two hours at this barricade, and seeing no fighting,\r\nI turned on to the Boulevard. There, troops were advancing slowly,\r\nwith loaded cannon. From time to time they charged the people, who\r\nslipped out of the way by side streets, as I did myself. Coming\r\nback on the Boulevard des Italiens, I found the entire length of\r\nthe Boulevards, from the Porte Saint-Denis to the Madeleine, filled\r\nwith troops in order of battle. In the novelty and beauty of the\r\nscene I quite lost sight of danger. At one time they chased away\r\nthe crowd; but soon sentinels were removed from the corners of the\r\nstreets, and as many spectators as thought proper pressed on to\r\nthe sidewalks of the Boulevard.... Opposite to me was the Seventh\r\nLancers,--a fine corps, recently arrived in Paris. Suddenly, at\r\nthe upper end of the line, the discharge of a cannon was heard,\r\nfollowed by a blaze of musketry and a general charge. The spectators\r\non the Boulevard took to flight. They pitched into open doors,\r\nor loudly demanded entrance at the closed ones. I was fortunate\r\nenough to get into a neighboring carriage-way, through the grated\r\n_porte-cochère_ of which I could see what was going on. The firing\r\nwas tremendous. Volley after volley followed so fast that it seemed\r\nlike one continued peal of thunder. Suddenly there was a louder\r\nand a nearer crash. The cavalry in front of me wavered; and then,\r\nas if struck by a panic, turned and rushed in disorder down the\r\nstreet, making the ground tremble under their tread. What could\r\nhave occurred? In a few minutes they came charging back, firing\r\ntheir pistols on all sides. Then came a quick succession of orders:\r\n'Shut all windows! Keep out of sight! Open the blinds!' etc. It\r\nseemed that unexpected shots had been fired from some of the windows\r\non the soldiers, from which they had suffered so much as to cause a\r\nrecoil. The roll of firearms was now terrific. Mortars and cannon\r\nwere fired at short-range point-blank at the suspicious houses, which\r\nwere then carried by assault. The rattle of small shot against windows\r\nand walls was incessant. This, too, was in the finest part of the\r\nBoulevard. Costly houses were completely riddled, their fronts were\r\nknocked in, their floors pierced with balls. The windows throughout\r\nthe neighborhood were destroyed by the concussion of the cannon. Of\r\nthe hairbreadth escape of some of the inmates, and of the general\r\ndestruction of property, I need not speak. The Government afterwards\r\nfooted all the bills for the last. The firing continued for more\r\nthan an hour, and then receded to more distant parts of the city;\r\nfor the field of combat embraced an area of several miles, and there\r\nwere forty thousand troops engaged in it. As soon as I could do\r\nso with safety, I left my covert, and endeavored to see what had\r\nhappened elsewhere. But troops guarded every possible avenue, and\r\nfired on all those who attempted to approach any interdicted spot.\r\nI noticed some pools of blood, but the corpses had been removed; in\r\na cross-street I saw a well-dressed man gasping his life away on\r\na rude stretcher. Those around him told me he had six balls in\r\nhim. In the Rue Richelieu there was the corpse of a young girl.\r\nSomebody had placed lighted candles at its head and feet. When I\r\nreached the parts of the town removed from the surveillance of\r\nthe soldiers, I noticed a bitter feeling among the better classes\r\nfor the day's work. The slaughter had been amongst those of their\r\nown class, which was unusual. The number slain was at first, of\r\ncourse, exaggerated, but it was with no gratifying emotions that\r\nwe could reduce it a few hundreds. It was civil war,--fratricide.\r\nI reached home indignant and mournful.\"\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo says of the massacre: \"There were no combatants on\r\nthe side of the people. There could not be said to have been any\r\nmob, though the Boulevard was crowded with spectators. Then, as\r\nthe wounded and terrified rushed into houses, the soldiers rushed\r\nin after them.\"\r\n\r\nTortoni's was gutted; the fashionable Baths of Jouvence were torn\r\nto pieces; one hotel was demolished; twenty-eight houses were so\r\ninjured that they had next day to be pulled down. Peaceful shopkeepers,\r\ndressmakers, and English strangers were among the slain,--an old man\r\nwith an umbrella, a young man with an opera-glass. In the house\r\nwhere Jouvin sold gloves there was a pile of dead bodies.\r\n\r\nThe firing was over by four P. M. It has never been known how many\r\nwere massacred. Some said twenty-five hundred, some made it five\r\nhundred, and almost every person killed was, not a Red combatant,\r\nbut an innocent victim.\r\n\r\nThus Louis Napoleon made himself master of Paris. The army was\r\nall for him, the masses were apathetic, the rural population was\r\non his side. A few weeks later a _plébiscite_ made him emperor.\r\n\r\nThe _coup d'état_ having succeeded, most Frenchmen gave in their\r\nadhesion to its author. It remained only to dispose of the prisoners.\r\nWithout any preliminary investigation, squads of them were shot,\r\nchiefly in the court-yard of the Prefecture of Police. All deputies\r\nof the Left were sent into exile, except some who were imprisoned\r\nin Algerine fortresses or sent to Cayenne,--the French political\r\npenal colony at that period.\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo remained a fortnight in hiding, believing, on the authority\r\nof Alexandre Dumas, that a price was set upon his head. He gives\r\nsome moving accounts of little children whom he saw lying in their\r\nblood on the evening of the massacre. His chief associates nearly\r\nall escaped arrest, and got away from France in various disguises.\r\nTheir adventures are all of them very picturesque, and some are\r\nvery amusing.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the eight prisoners at Ham suffered much from dampness.\r\nLamoricière, indeed, contracted permanent rheumatism during his\r\nimprisonment. He begged earnestly to be allowed to write to his\r\nwife, but was permitted to send her only three words, without date:\r\n\"I am well.\"\r\n\r\nOn the night of January 6, the commandant of the fortress, in full\r\nuniform, accompanied by a Government agent, entered the sleeping-room\r\nof each prisoner, and ordered him to rise and dress, as he was\r\nto be sent immediately into exile under charge of two agents of\r\npolice detailed to accompany him over the frontier. Nor was he\r\nto travel under his own name, a travelling _alias_ having been\r\nprovided for him. At the railroad station at Creil, Colonel Charras\r\nmet Changarnier. \"_Tiens, Général!_\" he cried, \"is that you? I am\r\ntravelling under the name of Vincent.\" \"And I,\" replied Changarnier,\r\n\"am called Leblanc.\" Each was placed with his two police agents\r\nin a separate carriage. The latter were armed. Their orders were\r\nto treat their prisoners with respect, but in case of necessity\r\nto shoot them.\r\n\r\nThe journey was made without incident until they reached Valenciennes,\r\na place very near the frontier line between France and Belgium.\r\nThere, as the _coup d'état_ had proved a success, official zeal\r\nwas in the ascendency. The police commissioner of Valenciennes\r\nexamined the passports. As he was taking Leblanc's into his hand,\r\nhe recognized the man before him. He started, and cried out: \"You\r\nare General Changarnier!\" \"That is no affair of mine at present,\"\r\nsaid the general. At once the police agents interposed, and assured\r\nthe commissioner that the passports were all in order. Nothing\r\nthey could say would convince him of the fact. The prefect and\r\ntown authorities, proud of their own sagacity in capturing State\r\nprisoners who were endeavoring to escape from France, held them\r\nin custody while they sent word of their exploit to Paris. They at\r\nonce received orders to put all the party on the train for Belgium.\r\n\r\nCharras was liberated at Brussels, Changarnier at Mons, Lamoricière\r\nwas carried to Cologne, M. Baze to Aix-la-Chapelle. They were not\r\nreleased at the same place nor at the same time, Louis Napoleon\r\nhaving said that safety required that a space should be put between\r\nthe generals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _EUGÉNIE._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR'S MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nA plébiscite--Louis Napoleon's political panacea--was ordered Dec.\r\n20, 1851, two weeks after the _coup d'état_, to say if the people\r\nof France approved or disapproved the usurpation of the prince\r\npresident. The national approval as expressed in this _plébiscite_\r\nwas overwhelming. Each peasant and artisan seemed to fancy he was\r\nvoting to revive the past glories of France, when expressing his\r\napproval of a Prince Napoleon. The more thoughtful voters, like M.\r\nde Montalembert, considered that the _coup d'état_ was a crushing\r\nblow struck at Red Republicanism, Communism, the International\r\nSociety, and disorder generally.\r\n\r\nFor a while the prince president governed by decrees; then a new\r\nlegislative body was assembled. Its first duty was to revise the\r\nconstitution. The republican constitution of 1850 was in the main\r\nre-adopted, but with one important alteration. The prince president\r\nwas to be turned into the Emperor Napoleon III., and the throne\r\nwas to be hereditary in his family.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of this measure it was submitted by another\r\n_plébiscite_ to the people. The _plébiscite_ is a universal suffrage\r\nvote of yes or no, in answer to some question put by the Government\r\nto the nation. The question this time was: Shall the prince president\r\nbecome emperor? There were 7,800,000 ayes, and 224,000 noes.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this overwhelming success reached the Élysée,\r\nLouis Napoleon sat so still and unmoved, smoking his cigar, that\r\nhis cousin, Madame Baiocchi, rushing up to him, shook him, and\r\nexclaimed: \"Is it possible that you are made of stone?\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus secured his elevation by the almost universal consent\r\nof Frenchmen, the new emperor's next step was to insure his dynasty\r\nby a marriage that might probably give heirs to the throne. He\r\nchose the title Napoleon III. because the son of the Great Napoleon\r\nhad been Napoleon II. for a few days after his father's abdication\r\nat Fontainebleau in 1814. The next heir to the imperial dignities\r\n(Lucien Bonaparte having refused anything of the kind for himself\r\nor for his family) was Jérôme Napoleon, familiarly called Plon-Plon.\r\nHe was the only son of Jérôme Bonaparte and the Princess Catherine\r\nof Würtemberg. But Prince Napoleon, though clever, was wilful and\r\neccentric, and made a boast of being a Red Republican; moreover,\r\nhis father's Baltimore marriage had made his legitimacy more than\r\ndoubtful,--at any rate, Louis Napoleon was by no means desirous\r\nof passing on to him the succession to the empire; and being now\r\nforty-four years old, he was desirous of marrying as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen a boy, it had been proposed to marry him to his cousin Mathilde,\r\nand something like an attachment had sprung up between them; but\r\nafter his fiasco at Strasburg he was no longer considered an eligible\r\nsuitor either for Princess Mathilde or another cousin who had been\r\nnamed for him, a princess of Baden. Princess Mathilde was married\r\nto the Russian banker, Prince Demidorff; but when Louis Napoleon\r\nbecame prince president, he requested her to preside at the Élysée.\r\n\r\nThe new emperor, or his advisers, looked round at the various\r\nmarriageable princesses belonging to the smaller courts of Germany.\r\nThe sister of that Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern whose selection for\r\nthe throne of Spain led afterwards to the Franco-Prussian war, was\r\nspoken of; but the lady most seriously considered was the Princess\r\nAdélaïde of Hohenlohe. She was daughter of Queen Victoria's half-sister\r\nFeodora; and to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, as heads of the\r\nfamily, the matter was referred. A recent memoir-writer tells us of\r\nseeing the queen at Windsor when the matter was under discussion.\r\nThe queen and her husband were apparently not averse to the alliance,\r\nhesitating only on the grounds of religion and morals; but it is\r\ndoubtful how far the new emperor went personally in the affair.\r\nHis inclination had for some time pointed to the reigning beauty\r\nof Paris, Mademoiselle Eugénie de Montijo.\r\n\r\nThis young lady's grandfather was Captain Fitzpatrick, of a good old\r\nScottish family, which had in past times married with the Stuarts.\r\nCaptain Fitzpatrick had been American consul at a port in southern\r\nSpain. He had a particularly charming daughter, who made a brilliant\r\nSpanish marriage, her husband being the Count de Teba (or Marquis\r\nde Montijo, for he bore both titles). The Montijos were connected\r\nwith the grandest ducal families in Spain and Portugal, and even\r\nwith the royal families of those nations.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Teba died while his two daughters were young, and they\r\nwere left under the guardianship of their very charming mother.\r\nThe elder married the Duke of Alva; the younger became the Empress\r\nEugénie.\r\n\r\nEugénie was for some time at school in England at Clifton. She\r\nwas described by those who knew her there as a pretty, sprightly\r\nlittle girl, much given to independence, and something of a tom\r\nboy,--a character there is reason to think she preserved until\r\nit was modified by the exigencies of her position.\r\n\r\nMr. George Ticknor, of Boston, frequently mentioned Madame de Teba\r\nto his friends as a singularly charming woman. In 1818 he wrote\r\nhome to a friend in America:\r\n\r\n\"I knew Madame de Teba in Madrid, and from what I saw of her there and\r\nat Malaga, I do not doubt she is the most cultivated and interesting\r\nwoman in Spain. Young, beautiful, educated strictly by her mother, a\r\nScotchwoman,--who for this purpose carried her to London and kept\r\nher there six or seven years,--possessing extraordinary talents, and\r\ngiving an air of originality to all she says and does, she unites\r\nin a most bewitching manner the Andalusian grace and frankness to a\r\nFrench facility in her manners and a genuine English thoroughness\r\nin her knowledge and accomplishments. She knows the chief modern\r\nlanguages well, and feels their different characters, and estimates\r\ntheir literature aright. She has the foreign accomplishments of\r\nsinging, painting, playing, etc., joined to the natural one of\r\ndancing, in a high degree. In conversation she is brilliant and\r\noriginal, yet with all this she is a true Spaniard, and as full\r\nof Spanish feelings as she is of talent and culture.\"\r\n\r\nWashington Irving, in 1853, thirty-five years later, writing to\r\nhis nephew, speaks in equal praise of Madame de Teba.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I told you,\" he says, \"that I knew the grandfather of\r\nthe empress, old Mr. Fitzpatrick. In 1827 I was in the house of his\r\nson-in-law, Count Teba, at Granada, a gallant, intelligent gentleman,\r\nmuch cut up in the wars, having lost an eye and been maimed in a\r\nleg and hand. Some years after, in Madrid, I was invited to the\r\nhouse of his widow, Madame de Montijo, one of the leaders of _ton_.\r\nShe received me with the warmth and eagerness of an old friend. She\r\nclaimed me as the friend of her late husband. She subsequently\r\nintroduced me to the little girls I had known in Granada, _now_\r\nfashionable belles in Madrid.\"\r\n\r\nIn some lines of Walter Savage Landor, Madame de Montijo was addressed\r\nas a \"lode-star of her sex.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Montijo had been an adherent of Joseph Bonaparte\r\nwhile the latter was king of Spain, and his eye had been put out\r\nat the battle of Salamanca. He was a liberal in politics, and his\r\nhouse was always open to cultivated men.\r\n\r\nSuch was the ancestry of the beautiful young lady who, tall, fair,\r\nand graceful, with hair like one of Titian's beauties, was travelling\r\nwith her mother from capital to capital, after the marriage of her\r\nsister to the Duke of Alva, and who spent the winters of 1850,\r\n1851, and 1852 in the French capital. Mademoiselle Eugénie had\r\nconceived a romantic admiration for the young prince who at Strasburg\r\nand Boulogne had been so unfortunate. Her father had been a stanch\r\nadherent of Bonaparte, and she is said to have pleaded with her\r\nmother at one time to visit the prisoner at Ham and to place her\r\nfortune at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance, when confided to the prince president, disposed\r\nhim to be interested in the young lady. She and her mother were\r\noften at the Élysée, at Fontainebleau, and at Compiègne. Mademoiselle\r\nde Montijo was a superb horsewoman, and riding was the emperor's\r\nespecial personal accomplishment. On one occasion they got lost\r\ntogether in the forest at Compiègne, and then society began to\r\nmake remarks upon their intimacy.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was indeed most seriously in love with Mademoiselle\r\nde Montijo. It is said, on the authority of M. de Goncourt, that\r\nin one of their rides he asked her, with strange frankness, if\r\nshe had ever been in love with any man. She answered with equal\r\nfrankness, \"I may have had fancies, sire, but I have never forgotten\r\nthat I was Mademoiselle de Montijo.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pierre de Lano. La Cour de L'Empereur Napoléon III.]\r\n\r\nSuch a project of marriage was not approved by the emperor's family,\r\nit was not favored by his ministers, and the ladies of his court\r\nwere all astir.\r\n\r\nAt a ball given on New Year's Day, 1853, by the emperor at the\r\nTuileries, the wife of a cabinet minister was rude and insulting\r\nto Mademoiselle de Montijo. Seeing that she looked troubled, the\r\nemperor inquired the cause; and when he knew it, he said quietly:\r\n\"To-morrow no one will dare to insult you again.\" There is also\r\na story, which seems to rest on good authority, that a few weeks\r\nbefore this, at Compiègne, he had placed a crown of oak-leaves on\r\nher head, saying: \"I hope soon to replace it with a better one.\"[2]\r\nLike the Empress Josephine, she had had it prophesied to her in\r\nher girlhood that she should one day wear a crown.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Jerrold, Life of Napoleon III.]\r\n\r\nThe day after the occurrence at the ball at the Tuileries, the\r\nDuc de Morny waited on Madame de Montijo with a letter from the\r\nemperor, formally requesting her daughter's hand.\r\n\r\nThe ladies, after this, removed to the Élysée, which was given to\r\nthem, and preparations for the marriage went on apace.\r\n\r\nIn less than a month afterwards Eugénie de Montijo was empress of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nHere is the emperor's own official announcement of his intended\r\nmarriage:--\r\n\r\n\"I accede to the wish so often manifested by my people in announcing\r\nmy marriage to you. The union which I am about to contract is not\r\nin harmony with old political traditions, and in this lies its\r\nadvantage. France, by her successive revolutions, has been widely\r\nsundered from the rest of Europe. A wise Government should so rule as\r\nto bring her back within the circle of ancient monarchies. But this\r\nresult will be more readily obtained by a frank and straightforward\r\npolicy, by a loyal intercourse, than by royal alliances, which often\r\ncreate false security, and subordinate national to family interests.\r\nMoreover, past examples have left superstitious beliefs in the\r\npopular mind. The people have not forgotten that for sixty years\r\nforeign princesses have mounted the steps of the throne only to see\r\ntheir race scattered and proscribed, either by war or revolution.\r\nOne woman alone appears to have brought with her good fortune, and\r\nlives, more than the rest, in the memory of the people; and this\r\nwoman, the wife of General Bonaparte, was not of royal blood. We\r\nmust admit this much, however. In 1810 the marriage of Napoleon I.\r\nwith Marie Louise was a great event. It was a bond for the future,\r\nand a real gratification to the national pride.... But when, in\r\nthe face of ancient Europe, one is carried by the force of a new\r\nprinciple to the level of the old dynasties, it is not by affecting\r\nan ancient descent and endeavoring at any price to enter the family\r\nof kings, that one compels recognition. It is rather by remembering\r\none's origin; it is by preserving one's own character, and assuming\r\nfrankly towards Europe the position of a _parvenu_,--a glorious title\r\nwhen one rises by the suffrages of a great people. Thus impelled, as\r\nI have been, to part from the precedents that have been hitherto\r\nfollowed, my marriage is only a private matter. It remained for me\r\nto choose my wife. She who has become the object of my choice is\r\nof lofty birth, French in heart and education and by the memory of\r\nthe blood shed by her father in the cause of the Empire. She has,\r\nas a Spaniard, the advantage of not having a family in France to\r\nwhom it would be necessary to give honors and dignities. Gifted with\r\nevery quality of the heart, she will be the ornament of the throne,\r\nas in the hour of danger she would be one of its most courageous\r\ndefenders. A pious Catholic, she will address one prayer with me\r\nto Heaven for the happiness of France. Kindly and good, she will\r\nshow in the same position, I firmly believe, the virtues of the\r\nEmpress Josephine.\"\r\n\r\nThe State coaches of the First Empire were regilded for the occasion,\r\nthe crown diamonds were drawn from the hiding-place where they\r\nhad lain since Louis Philippe's time, and were reset for the lady\r\nwho was to wear them, while her apartments at the Tuileries were\r\nrapidly prepared.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was radiant. He had followed his inclination, and now\r\nthat his choice was made, it seemed to receive universal approval.\r\nThe London \"Times\" said: \"Mademoiselle de Montijo knows better the\r\ncharacter of France than any princess who could have been fetched\r\nfrom a German principality. She combines by her birth the energy\r\nof the Scottish and Spanish races, and if the opinion we hold of\r\nher be correct, she is, as Napoleon says, made not only to adorn\r\nthe throne, but to defend it in the hour of danger.\"\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Council of Paris voted six hundred thousand francs\r\nto buy her a diamond necklace as a wedding present. Very gracefully\r\nshe declined the necklace, but accepted the money, with which she\r\nendowed an Orphan Asylum.\r\n\r\nThe wedding-day was Jan. 29, 1853. Crowds lined the streets as the\r\nbride and her _cortège_ drove to the Tuileries, where they were\r\nreceived by the Grand Chamberlain and other court dignitaries, who\r\nconducted the bride to the first _salon_. There she was received by\r\nPrince Napoleon and his sister, the Princess Mathilde, who introduced\r\nher into the _salon_, where the emperor, with his uncle, King Jérôme,\r\nsurrounded by a glittering throng of cardinals, marshals, admirals,\r\nand great officers of State, stood ready to receive her. Thence, at\r\nnine o'clock, she was led by the emperor to the Salle des Maréchaux\r\nand seated beside him on a raised throne. The marriage contract\r\nwas then read, and signed by the bride and bridegroom and by all\r\nthe princes and princesses present.\r\n\r\nThe bride wore a marvellous dress of Alençon point lace, clasped\r\nwith a diamond and sapphire girdle made for the Empress Marie Louise,\r\nand she looked, said a beholder, \"the imperial beauty of a poet's\r\nvision.\" The emperor was in a general's uniform. He wore the collar\r\nof the Legion of Honor which his uncle the Great Emperor used to\r\nwear. He wore also the collar of the Golden Fleece that had once\r\nbelonged to the Emperor Charles V.\r\n\r\nThe civil marriage being concluded, the imperial pair and the wedding\r\nguests passed into the theatre, where a _cantata_, composed by\r\nAuber for the occasion, was sung. The empress, robed in lace and\r\nglittering in jewels, seemed, says an eye-witness, to realize the\r\npicture presented of herself in the composer's words:--\r\n\r\n  \"Espagne bien aimée,\r\n    Où le ciel est vermeil,\r\n  C'est toi qui l'as formée\r\n    D'un rayon de soleil.\"[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1:\r\n  Ah, beautiful Spain,\r\n    With thy skies ever bright,\r\n  Thou hast formed her for us\r\n    From a ray of sunlight.]\r\n\r\nWhen the _cantata_ had been sung, the Grand Master of the Ceremonies\r\nconducted the bride, as yet only half married, back to the Élysée.\r\n\r\nThe next morning all Paris was astir to see the wedding procession\r\npass to the cathedral of Notre Dame. Early in the morning the emperor\r\nhad repaired to the Élysée, where, in the chapel, he and the empress\r\nhad heard mass, and after making their confession, had partaken\r\nof the Holy Communion. There were two hundred thousand sightseers\r\nin Paris that day, in addition to the usual population.\r\n\r\nThe empress wore upon her golden hair the crown that the First\r\nNapoleon had placed upon the head of Marie Louise. The body of\r\nthe church was filled with men,--ambassadors, military and naval\r\nofficers, and high officials. Their wives were in the galleries.\r\nAs the great doors of the cathedral were opened to admit the bridal\r\nprocession, a broad path of light gleamed from the door up to the\r\naltar, adding additional brilliancy to the glittering scene. Up\r\nthe long aisle the emperor led his bride, flashing with the light\r\nof jewels, among them the unlucky regent diamond, which glittered\r\non her bosom. After the Spanish fashion, she crossed her brow,\r\nher lips, her heart, her thumb, as she knelt for the nuptial\r\nbenediction. The ceremony over, the archbishop conducted the married\r\npair to the porch of the cathedral, and they drove along the Quai\r\nto the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nThe first favor the empress asked of her husband was the pardon\r\nof more than four thousand unfortunate persons still exiled or\r\nimprisoned for their share in the risings that succeeded the _coup\r\nd'état_.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington Irving heard of the marriage, he wrote: \"Louis\r\nNapoleon and Eugénie de Montijo,--Emperor and Empress of France!\r\nHe whom I received as an exile at my cottage on the Hudson, she\r\nwhom at Granada I have dandled on my knee! The last I saw of Eugénie\r\nde Montijo, she and her gay circle had swept away a charming young\r\ngirl, beautiful and accomplished, my dear young friend, into their\r\ncareer of fashionable dissipation. Now Eugénie is on a throne,\r\nand the other a voluntary recluse in a convent of one of the most\r\nrigorous Orders.\" This convent is near Biarritz, where the nuns\r\ntake vows of silence like the monks of La Trappe.[1] The empress\r\nwhen at Biarritz never failed to visit her former friend, who was\r\npermitted to converse with her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Saturday Review, 1885.]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful woman thus raised to the imperial throne[2] was a\r\nmixed character,--not so perfect as some have represented her,\r\nbut entirely to be acquitted of those grave faults that envy or\r\ndisappointed expectations have attributed to her. Her character united\r\nkind-heartedness with inconsideration, imprudence with austerity,\r\nardent feeling with great practical common-sense. Probably the\r\nemperor understood her very little at the time of his marriage, and\r\nthat she long remained to him an enigma may have been one of her\r\ncharms. With the impetuosity of her disposition and the intrepidity\r\nthat had characterized her girlhood, she found it hard to submit\r\nto the restraints of her position, and the emperor had occasion\r\nfrequently to remonstrate with her on her indifference to etiquette\r\nand public opinion. It was not until after her visit to Windsor\r\nin 1855 that she could be induced to establish court rules at the\r\nTuileries, and to prescribe for herself and others, in public, a\r\nstrict system of etiquette. But in her private hours, among her\r\nearly friends, in the circle of ladies admitted to her intimacy,\r\nthe empress was less discreet. Her impressions were apt to run\r\ninto extremes; she indulged in whims like other pretty women; yet\r\nshe was never carried by her romantic feelings or her enthusiasm\r\nbeyond her power of self-control. Though careless of etiquette in\r\nprivate life, whenever a great occasion came, she could act with\r\nimperial dignity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Pierre de Lano.]\r\n\r\nAlthough she often experienced ingratitude, she was always generous.\r\nShe was as ready to solicit favors and pardons as was the Empress\r\nJosephine. Sometimes she was even sorely embarrassed to find arguments\r\nin favor of her _protégés_. \"_Ah, mon Dieu!_\" she cried once, when\r\npleading for the pardon of a workman, \"how could he be guilty?\r\nHe has a wife and five children to support; he could have had no\r\ntime for conspiracy!\"\r\n\r\nAs a wife she was devoted, not only to the public interests of her\r\nhusband, but to his personal welfare. She was constantly anxious\r\nlest he should suffer from overwork; and her little select evening\r\nparties, which some people found fault with, were instituted by\r\nher with the chief object of amusing him.\r\n\r\nBen Jonson makes it a reproach against a lady of the sixteenth century\r\nthat she would not \"suffer herself to be admired.\" No such reproach\r\ncould be addressed to the Empress Eugénie. Few women conscious of\r\ntheir power to charm will fail to exercise it. In the case of an\r\nempress,--young, lively, of an independent and adventurous spirit, and\r\nvery beautiful,--all who approached her thought better of themselves\r\nfrom her apparent appreciation of their claims to consideration;\r\nand, indeed, in her position was it not the duty of the successor\r\nof Josephine to be gracious and charming to everybody?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the ladies who most enjoyed the intimacy of the Empress\r\nEugénie were foreigners. She seems to have felt a certain distrust\r\nof Frenchwomen; and considering the ingratitude she often met with\r\nfrom those she served, it is hardly surprising that she preferred\r\nthe intimacy of women who could not look to her for favors.\r\n\r\nOne of the ladies most intimate with the empress was the wife of\r\nPrince Richard Metternich, the Austrian ambassador. This lady seems\r\nto have had personal and political ends in view, and to have succeeded\r\nin inducing the empress to adopt and further them. That she was a\r\ndangerous and false friend may be judged from a speech she made\r\nwhen remonstrated with for countenancing and encouraging a project,\r\nfavored by the empress, of making a promenade in the forest of\r\nFontainebleau with her court-ladies in skirts which, like those\r\nin the old Scotch ballad, should be \"kilted up to the knee.\" \"You\r\nwould not have advised your own empress,\" it was said to her, \"to\r\nappear in such a garb.\" \"Of course not,\" replied the ambassadress;\r\n\"but _my_ empress is of royal birth.--a real empress; while yours,\r\n_ma chère_, was Mademoiselle de Montijo!\"\r\n\r\nBrought up in private life, not early trained to the self-abnegation\r\ndemanded of princesses, the Empress Eugénie did not bring into her\r\nnew sphere all the _aplomb_ and seriousness about little things\r\nwhich are early inculcated on ladies brought up to the profession\r\nof royalty. The career for which she had formed herself was that\r\nof a very charming woman; and one secret of her fascination was\r\nthe sincerity of the interest she took in those around her. She\r\nloved to study character, to see into men's souls. She loved to\r\nbe adored, while irresponsively she received men's homage. She\r\nespecially liked the society of famous men, and when she was to\r\nmeet them, she took pains to inform herself on the subjects about\r\nwhich they were most likely to converse.\r\n\r\nThat Queen Victoria loves her as a sister and a friend, is a testimony\r\nto her dignity and goodness; and we have her husband's own opinion\r\nof her, published on her fête-day, Dec. 15, 1868, after nearly\r\nsixteen years of marriage. The emperor had under his control a\r\nmonthly magazine called \"Le Dix Décembre,\" in which he often inserted\r\narticles from his own pen. The manuscript of this, in his own\r\nhandwriting, was found in 1870 in the sack of the Tuileries. He\r\nomits all mention of his wife's Scotch ancestry, neither does he\r\nallude to her school-days in England. He speaks of her as a member\r\nof one of the most distinguished families in Spain, extols her\r\nfather's attachment to the house of Bonaparte, and tells how she and\r\nher sister were placed at the Sacré Coeur, near Paris, declaring that\r\n\"she acquired, we may say, the French before the Spanish language.\"\r\nHe goes on to speak of her, not as the leader of a giddy circle of\r\nfashion in Madrid, as Washington Irving describes her, but as the\r\nthoughtful, studious young girl, with a precocious taste for social\r\nproblems and for the society of men of letters; and he adds that after\r\nher marriage her simple, natural tastes did not disappear. \"After her\r\nvisit to the cholera patients at Amiens,\" he says, \"nothing seemed\r\nto surprise her more than the applause that everywhere celebrated\r\nher courage. She seemed at last distressed by it.... At Compiègne,\"\r\nhe also tells us, \"nothing can be more attractive than five o'clock\r\ntea _à l'impératrice_; though,\" he adds slyly, \"sometimes she is\r\na little too fond of argument.\"\r\n\r\nAssuredly she filled a difficult place, and filled it well; but\r\nthe court of the Second Empire was all spangles and tinsel. It\r\nwas composed of men and women all more or less adventurers. It was\r\nthe court of the _nouveaux riches_ and of a mushroom aristocracy.\r\nThere were prizes to be won and pleasures to be enjoyed, and it\r\nwas \"like as it was in the days of Noë, until the flood came, and\r\nswept them all away.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the crowd that composed this court the emperor and\r\nthe empress shine out as the best. Both wanted to do their duty,\r\nas they understood it, to France. Whether it was the emperor's\r\nfault or his misfortune, is still undecided; but, with one or two\r\nexceptions, he was able to attach to himself only keen-witted\r\nadventurers and mediocre men. Among the women, not one who was\r\nreally superior rose above the crowd. The empress led a giddy circle\r\nof married women, as in her youth, according to Washington Irving,\r\nshe had led a giddy circle of young girls.\r\n\r\nThe two most able men among the emperor's advisers were his own\r\nkinsmen,--Count Walewski, who died in 1868, and the Duc de Morny,\r\na man calm, polished, socially amiable, and so clever that Guizot\r\nonce said to him: \"My dear Morny, you are the only man who could\r\noverturn the Empire; but you will never be foolish enough to do\r\nit.\" By his death, in 1865, Louis Napoleon was bereft of his ablest\r\nadviser.\r\n\r\nPersigny, or Fialin, had been the close personal friend of the\r\nemperor in his exile, and took a prominent part in the abortive\r\nexpedition to Boulogne. In his youth he had led a disreputable\r\nlife, and was not a man of great intellect, but he was presumed\r\nto be devoted to his old comrade. His friendship, however, had not\r\nalways a happy effect upon the fortunes of his master. In 1872 he\r\nmade a miserable end of his adventurous life, after having turned\r\nagainst the emperor in his adversity.\r\n\r\nFleury was another personal friend of Louis Napoleon, and was probably\r\nhis best. The prince president had distinguished him when he was\r\nonly a subaltern in the army. He had enlisted in the ranks, and\r\nhad done good service in Algeria. In the emperor's last days of\r\nfailing health he loved to keep Fleury beside him; but the empress\r\nwas jealous of her husband's friend, and used her influence to\r\nhave him honorably exiled to St. Petersburg as French ambassador.\r\nThis post he occupied when the Franco-Prussian war broke out, so\r\nthat he could be of little help to his master.\r\n\r\nSaint-Arnaud had been made a marshal and minister of war, in spite\r\nof having been twice turned out of the French army.\r\n\r\nM. Rouher had charge of the emperor's financial concerns, and Fould\r\nwas a man who understood bureau-work, and how to manipulate government\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nWhoever might be the emperor's ministers, this little clique of\r\nhis personal adherents--De Morny, Persigny, Saint-Arnaud, Fleury,\r\nRouher, and Fould--were always around their master, giving him\r\ntheir advice and sharing (so far as he allowed anyone to share)\r\nhis intimate councils.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Bonaparte family were an immense expense to the\r\nemperor, and gave him no little trouble. They were not the least\r\nthirsty among those who thronged around the fountain of wealth and\r\nhonor; and their importunate demands upon the emperor's bounty led\r\nto a perpetual and reckless waste of money. The empress frequently\r\nremonstrated with her husband in regard to his lavish largesses\r\nand too generous expenditure. Contrary to what has been generally\r\nsupposed, she was herself orderly and methodical in her expenditures\r\nand accounts, always carefully examining her bills, and though by\r\nthe emperor's express desire she always expended the large amount\r\nannually allowed her, she never exceeded that sum.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, the revived imperialism of Louis Napoleon was not, like\r\nLegitimacy, a _cause_, but to most persons who supported it, it\r\nwas a speculation. Adherents had therefore to be attracted to it\r\nby hopes of gain, and all services had to be handsomely rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe emperor's policy in the early years of his reign may be said\r\nto have been twofold. He wanted to make France increase in material\r\nprosperity, and he wished to have money freely spent within her\r\nborders. He set on foot all kinds of improvements in Paris, and\r\nall kinds of useful enterprises in the provinces. Work was plenty;\r\nmoney flowed freely; the empire was everywhere popular. But the\r\ngovernment of France was the government of one man; and if anything\r\nhappened to that one man, where would be the government? There\r\nseemed no need to ask that question while France was prosperous\r\nand Paris gay. France under the Second Empire was quieter than\r\nshe had been for any eighteen years since the Great Revolution;\r\nand for that she was grateful to Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nHis foreign policy was still more successful. \"The Empire is peace,\"\r\nhe had early proclaimed to be his motto. At first the idea of a\r\nNapoleon on the throne of France had greatly terrified the nations;\r\nbut by degrees it seemed as if he really meant to be the Napoleon\r\nof Peace, as his uncle had been the Napoleon of War. He took every\r\nopportunity of reiterating his desire to be on good terms with\r\nhis neighbors. With respect to England, those who knew him best\r\nasserted earnestly that he had always been in sympathy with the\r\ncountry that had sheltered him in exile. Count Walewski, whom he sent\r\nover as ambassador to London, was very popular there. He attended\r\nthe funeral of the Duke of Wellington in his official capacity,\r\nand in return for this courtesy England restored to the French\r\nemperor his uncle's will, which had been laid up in Doctor's Commons\r\nwith other wills of persons who had died on English soil. Russia\r\nwas haughty to the new emperor; but the other courts of Europe\r\naccepted him, and most of them did so with considerable alacrity;\r\nfor was he not holding down Socialism and Internationalism, which\r\nthey dreaded far more than Napoleonism, and by which they were\r\nmenaced in their own lands?\r\n\r\nThe great perplexity of the new emperor was his relation to Italy.\r\nHe and his brother had taken the oaths of a Carbonaro in that country,\r\nin 1831. It is not to this day certain that his brother did not die\r\nby a Carbonaro's knife, rather than by the measles. Be that as\r\nit may, Louis Napoleon knew that if he failed to keep his promises\r\nas to the liberation of Italy, assassination awaited him.\r\n\r\nHow he endeavored to reconcile his engagements as a Carbonaro with\r\nhis policy as the French emperor belongs less to the historical\r\ngossip of France than to that of Italy. So too the history of the\r\nCrimean War seems to belong _par excellence_ to that of Russia. It\r\nwas undertaken by England and France as allies, joined afterwards\r\nby a Sardinian army under General La Marmora, by the Turkish troops\r\nunder Omar Pasha, and by an Egyptian contingent; but as we are\r\nnow engaged on the personal history of the emperor and empress,\r\nI will rather here tell how Napoleon III., having formed a camp\r\nof one hundred thousand soldiers at Boulogne, on the very ground\r\nwhere his uncle had assembled his great army for the invasion of\r\nEngland, decided to ascertain, through his ambassador in London,\r\nif it would be agreeable to Prince Albert to visit that camp and\r\nsee the manoeuvres of his army. Finding that the invitation would be\r\nacceptable to the prince, he addressed him the following letter:--\r\n\r\n  July 3, 1854.\r\n\r\nMON FRÈRE,--Your Royal Highness knows that putting in practice\r\nyour own idea, and wishing to carry out to the end the struggle\r\nwith Russia that we have begun together, I have decided to form an\r\narmy between Boulogne and St. Omer. I need not tell your Highness\r\nhow pleased I should be to see you, and how happy I should be to\r\nshow you my soldiers. I am convinced, moreover, that personal ties\r\nwill strengthen the union so happily established between two great\r\nnations. I beg you to present my respectful homage to the queen,\r\nand to receive this expression of the esteem and sincere affection\r\nI have conceived for you.\r\n\r\nWith this, _mon frère_, I pray God to have you in his holy keeping.\r\n\r\n  NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\nThe prince accepted the invitation, addressing the emperor as \"Sire\r\net mon frère.\" The queen entirely approved the visit, and Baron\r\nStockmar predicted much advantage from it, \"inasmuch,\" he said,\r\n\"as the good or evil destiny of the present time will directly and\r\nchiefly depend upon a rational, honorable, and resolute alliance\r\nbetween England and France.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Albert met the emperor at Boulogne, Sept. 4, 1854. The Duke\r\nof Newcastle, who was in attendance on Prince Albert, wrote to a\r\nfriend that tears stood in the emperor's eyes when he received\r\nhis guest as he stepped upon French soil; and the prince wrote\r\nthat evening to the queen:--\r\n\r\n\"The emperor has been very nervous, if we are to believe those who\r\nstood near him and who know him well. He was kindly and courteous,\r\nand does not look so old nor so pale as his portraits make him, and\r\nis much gayer than he is generally represented. The visit cannot\r\nfail to be a source of great gratification to him.... I have had\r\ntwo long talks with him, in which he spoke very sensibly about the\r\nwar and the _questions du jour_. People here are sanguine about\r\nthe results of the expedition to the Crimea, and very sensitive\r\nabout the behavior of Admiral Sir Charles Napier.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince adds in his letter, the same evening:--\r\n\r\n\"The emperor thaws more and more. This evening after dinner I withdrew\r\nwith him to his sitting-room for half an hour before rejoining his\r\nguests, in order that he might smoke his cigarette,--in which\r\noccupation, to his amazement, I could not keep him company. He\r\ntold me that one of the deepest impressions ever made on him was,\r\nwhen having gone from France to Rio Janeiro and thence to the United\r\nStates, and being recalled to Europe by the rumor of his mother's\r\nserious illness, he arrived in London directly after King William's\r\ndeath, and saw you going to open parliament for the first time.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently the prince tells the queen,--\r\n\r\n\"We discussed all topics of home and foreign policy, material and\r\npersonal, with the greatest frankness, and I can say but good of what\r\nI heard.... He was brought up in the German fashion in Germany,--a\r\ntraining which has developed a German turn of mind. As to all modern\r\npolitical history, so far as this is not Napoleonic, he is without\r\ninformation; so that he wants many of the materials for accurate\r\njudgment.\"\r\n\r\nDickens, who was at Boulogne on this occasion, thus tells of Prince\r\nAlbert's arrival:--\r\n\r\n\"The town looks like one immense flag, it is so decked out with\r\nstreamers; and as the royal yacht approached yesterday, the whole\r\nrange of the cliff-tops was lined with troops, and the artillerymen,\r\nmatches in hand, stood ready to fire the great guns the moment\r\nshe made the harbor, the sailors standing up in the prow of the\r\nyacht, the prince, in a blazing uniform, left alone on the deck for\r\neverybody to see,--a stupendous silence, and then such an infernal\r\nblazing and banging as never was heard. It was almost as fine a\r\nsight as one could see, under a deep blue sky.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the guest of the emperor, Prince Albert expressed to him\r\nthe queen's hope that they should see him in England, and that she\r\nshould make the acquaintance of the empress.\r\n\r\nThe prince, an excellent judge of character, in a subsequent memorandum\r\nconcerning his impressions, says,--\r\n\r\n\"The emperor appeared quiet and indolent from constitution, not\r\neasily excited, but gay and humorous when at his ease. His French\r\nis not without a little German accent, and his pronunciation of\r\nGerman is better than of English.... He recited a poem by Schiller\r\non the advantages to man of peace and war, which seemed to have made\r\na deep impression upon him, and appeared to me to be not without\r\nsignificance with reference to his own life. His court and household\r\nare strictly kept and in good order, more English than French.\r\nThe gentlemen composing his _entourage_ are not distinguished by\r\nbirth, manners, or education. He lives on a familiar footing with\r\nthem, although they seemed afraid of him. The tone was rather that\r\nof a garrison, with a good deal of smoking.... He is very chilly,\r\ncomplains of rheumatism, and goes early to bed, takes no pleasure\r\nin music, but is proud of his horsemanship.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking again of the emperor's lack of information as to the history\r\nof politics, Prince Albert says:--\r\n\r\n\"But he is remarkably modest in acknowledging these defects, and\r\nin not pretending to know what he does not. All that relates to\r\nNapoleonic politics he has at his finger's ends. He also appears to\r\nhave thought much and deeply on politics, yet more like an amateur\r\npolitician, mixing many very sound and very crude notions together.\r\nHe admires English institutions, and regrets the absence of an\r\naristocracy in France, but might not be willing to allow such an\r\naristocracy to control his own power, whilst he might wish to have\r\nthe advantage of its control over the pure democracy.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor closely questioned the prince about the working of\r\nthe English government and the queen's relations to her ministers.\r\nPrince Albert writes,--\r\n\r\n\"He said that he did not allow his ministers to meet or to discuss\r\nmatters together; that they transacted their business solely with\r\nhim. He seemed astonished when I told him that every despatch went\r\nthrough the queen's hands and was read by her, as he only received\r\nextracts made from them, and indeed appeared to have little time\r\nor inclination generally to read. When I observed to him that the\r\nqueen would not be content without seeing the whole of the diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence, he replied that he found a full compensation in\r\nhaving persons in his own employ and confidence at the different\r\nposts of importance, who reported solely to him. I could not but\r\nexpress my sense of the danger of such an arrangement, to which\r\nno statesman, in England at least, would submit.\"\r\n\r\nI have quoted this memorandum of Prince Albert's, because it points\r\nout the perils which led to the downfall or the Empire,--the emperor's\r\nbad _entourage_; his personal government, assisted only by private\r\nconfidential relations with irresponsible persons; his mixture of\r\ncrude and sensible ideas of government; his indolence; and his\r\ntendency to let things slide out of his own hands.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the whole,\" concluded the prince, \"my impression is that\r\nneither in home nor foreign politics would the emperor naturally\r\ntake any violent step, but that he appears in distress for means\r\nof governing, and is obliged to look about him from day to day.\r\nHaving deprived the people of any active participation in the\r\ngovernment, and reduced them to the mere position of spectators,\r\nthey grow impatient, like a crowd at a display of fireworks, whenever\r\nthere is any cessation in the display. Still, he appears the only\r\nman who has any hold on France, relying on the name of Napoleon.\r\nHe said to the Duke of Newcastle:\r\n\r\n'Former Governments have tried to reign by the support of one million\r\nof the educated classes; I claim to lay hold of the other twenty-nine.'\r\nHe is decidedly benevolent, and anxious for the good of the people,\r\nbut has, like all rulers before him, a bad opinion of their political\r\ncapacity.\"\r\n\r\nStrange to say, in the midst of war the Universal Exposition of\r\n1855 took place in Paris. The winter was horribly severe, and the\r\narmies in the Crimea suffered terribly. The emperor was extremely\r\ndesirous to go himself to the seat of war, but was urged by every\r\none about him to remain at home. All kinds of good reasons were\r\nput forward for this advice, but probably not the one subsequently\r\nadvanced by one of his generals after the campaign of Italy in\r\n1859. \"It used to be said that the presence of the First Napoleon\r\nwith his army was worth a reinforcement of forty thousand men.\r\nThe army now feels that the presence of the Third Napoleon equals\r\nthe loss of about the same number.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Queen Victoria had expressed a wish to welcome\r\nthe emperor and empress at Windsor Castle. It was on April 16,\r\n1855, that the imperial pair reached England, and were received by\r\nPrince Albert on board their yacht. They met with a hearty national\r\ngreeting on their way to London. In London itself crowds lined the\r\nstreets. \"It was,\" says an eye-witness, \"one bewildering triumph,\r\nin which it was estimated that a million of people took part.\"\r\nThe \"Times\" reporter noticed that as the emperor passed his old\r\nresidence in King Street, St. James's, he pointed it out to the\r\nempress as the place where he was living when the events of 1848\r\nsummoned him to Paris.\r\n\r\n\"Only seven years before,\" observes his biographer, Mr. Jerrold,\r\n\"he was wont to stroll unnoticed, with his faithful dog at his\r\nheels, from this house to the news-vendor's stall by the Burlington\r\nArcade, to get the latest news from revolutionary France; now he was\r\nthe guest of the English people, on his way through cheering crowds\r\nto Windsor Castle, where the queen was waiting in the vestibule to\r\nreceive him.\" The same rooms were prepared for him that had been\r\ngiven to Louis Philippe and to the Emperor Nicholas. Queen Victoria\r\ntells us in her diary,--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say what indescribable emotions filled me,--how much\r\nall seemed like a wonderful dream.... I advanced and embraced the\r\nEmperor, ... and then the very gentle, graceful, and evidently\r\nnervous empress. We presented the princes and our children (Vicky,\r\nwith very alarmed eyes, making very low courtesies). The emperor\r\nembraced Bertie, and then he went upstairs, Albert leading the\r\nempress, who, in the most engaging manner, refused to go first, but\r\nat length, with graceful reluctance, did so, the emperor leading\r\nme and expressing his great gratification in being here and seeing\r\nme, and admiring Windsor.\"\r\n\r\nAt dinner, on the day of his arrival, the new ruler of France seems\r\nto have charmed the queen. \"He is,\" she records in her journal,\r\n\"so very quiet. His voice is low and soft. _Et il ne fait pas des\r\nphrases._\"\r\n\r\nWhen the war was talked about, the emperor spoke of his wish to\r\ngo out to the Crimea, and the queen noticed that the empress was\r\nas eager as himself that he should go. \"She sees no greater danger\r\nfor him _there_,\" she adds, \"than in Paris. She said she was seldom\r\nalarmed for him except when he went out quite alone of a morning....\r\nShe is full of courage and spirit, and yet so gentle, with such\r\ninnocence and _enjouement_, that the _ensemble_ is most charming.\r\nWith all her great liveliness she has the prettiest and most modest\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen little guessed what commotion and excitement had gone on\r\nbefore dinner in the private apartments of the emperor and empress,\r\nwhen it was discovered that the case containing all the beautiful\r\ntoilet prepared for the occasion had not arrived. The emperor suggested\r\nto his wife to retire to rest on the plea of fatigue after the\r\njourney, but she decided to borrow a blue-silk dress from one of\r\nher ladies-in-waiting, in which, with only flowers in her hair,\r\nshe increased the queen's impression of her simplicity and modesty.\r\n\r\nDuring the visit the emperor asked the queen where Louis Philippe's\r\nwidow, Queen Marie Amélie, was living. She had been at Windsor Castle\r\nonly a few days before, and the queen had looked sorrowfully after\r\nher as she drove away, with shabby post-horses, to her residence\r\nnear Richmond. The emperor begged her Majesty to express to Louis\r\nPhilippe's widow his hope that she would not hesitate to pass through\r\nFrance on any journey she might make to Spain.\r\n\r\nThere was a review of the household troops, commanded by Lord Cardigan,\r\nwho had led the charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava, and who\r\nrode the same charger. The emperor rode a fiery, beautiful chestnut,\r\nand his horsemanship was much admired. That evening there was a\r\nState ball at Windsor Castle, and the queen danced a quadrille\r\nwith the emperor. The queen wrote that evening in her journal: \"How\r\nstrange to think that I--the granddaughter of George III.--should\r\ndance with the Emperor Napoleon, nephew of England's greatest enemy,\r\nnow my nearest and most intimate ally, in the Waterloo Room, and\r\nthat ally living in this country only six years ago in exile, poor\r\nand unthought of!\"\r\n\r\nShe adds, speaking of the empress: \"Her manner is the most perfect\r\nthing I have ever seen, so gentle and graceful and kind, and the\r\ncourtesy is charming,--so modest and retiring withal.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day came a council attended by the emperor, Prince Albert,\r\nministers, and diplomatists, which lasted so very long that the\r\nqueen herself knocked at the door and reminded them that at four\r\no'clock the emperor was to be invested with the Order of the Garter.\r\n\r\nAfter this ceremony was over, the emperor remarked to the queen\r\nthat he had now sworn fidelity to her Majesty, and would carefully\r\nkeep his oath.\r\n\r\nAt dinner that day the talk fell on assassination. The emperor\r\nwas shot at by a Carbonaro only a few days after his return from\r\nWindsor, and four years later by Orsini.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving England the emperor attended a banquet given to\r\nhim by the Lord Mayor. At Windsor he read his speech (in English)\r\nto the queen and prince, who pronounced it a very good one.\r\n\r\nNext day the royalties went to see the Crystal Palace, at Sydenham.\r\nThere they were surrounded by sight-seeing throngs, and in such a\r\ncrowd there was every chance for a pistol-shot from some French\r\nor Italian refugee. \"I own I felt anxious,\" writes the queen; \"I\r\nfelt as I walked, leaning on the emperor's arm, that I was possibly\r\na protection to him.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards she writes,--\r\n\r\n\"On all, this visit has left a permanent satisfactory impression. It\r\nwent off so well,--not a _contre-temps_ ... fine weather, everything\r\nsmiling, the nation enthusiastic and happy in the alliance of two\r\ngreat countries whose enmity would be fatal.... I am glad to have\r\nknown this extraordinary man, whom it is certainly not possible\r\nnot to like when you live with him, and not, even to a considerable\r\nextent, to admire.... I believe him capable of kindness, affection,\r\nfriendship, gratitude. I feel confidence in him as regards the\r\nfuture. I think he is frank, means well to us, and, as Stockmar\r\nsays, that we have insured his sincerity and good faith to us for\r\nthe rest of his life.\"\r\n\r\nNearly a year after this visit, when the emperor and empress had\r\nbeen married about three years, the Prince Imperial was born, March\r\n16, 1856. A few hours after his birth he was christened Napoleon\r\nEugène Louis Jean Joseph. Pope Pius IX. was his godfather, the\r\nQueen of Sweden his godmother. For many hours the empress, like\r\nher imperial predecessor Marie Louise, was dangerously ill.\r\n\r\nThe Crimean War had by that time virtually come to a triumphant\r\nend. The emperor had at last an heir; all things appeared to smile\r\nupon him. A general amnesty was issued to all political offenders. The\r\nemperor became godfather and the empress godmother to all legitimate\r\nchildren born in France upon their son's birthday, and finally the\r\nlittle prince had a public baptism at Notre Dame, followed by a\r\nball of extraordinary magnificence, given by the city of Paris to\r\nthe mother of the heir-apparent, at the Hôtel-de-Ville.\r\n\r\nThe chief trouble that menaced the imperial throne at this period\r\nwas the extraordinary lavishness which the emperor's _entourage_ of\r\nspeculative adventurers encouraged him to incur in all directions;\r\nthe recklessness of speculation; the general mania for gain that\r\nwent on around him. There had also been terrible inundations in\r\nFrance, and a bad harvest. Many things also that disgusted and\r\ndisquieted the emperor were going on among the persons who surrounded\r\nhim,--persons in whom he had placed confidence; and it was one of\r\nhis good qualities that he was always slow to believe evil. Still,\r\nthese things were forced on his attention, and greatly disturbed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis little son was from the first his idol. Here is a letter he wrote\r\nto Prince Albert, acknowledging Queen Victoria's congratulations:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been greatly touched to learn that all your family have\r\nshared my joy, and all my hope is that my son may resemble dear\r\nlittle Prince Arthur, and that he may have the rare qualities of\r\nyour children. The sympathy shown on the late occasion by the English\r\npeople is another bond between the two countries, and I hope my son\r\nwill inherit my feelings of true friendship for the royal family of\r\nEngland, and of affectionate esteem for the great English nation.\"\r\n\r\nA few months later, the future Emperor Frederick, then recently\r\nengaged to the Princess Royal of England, visited Paris. He was\r\nattended by Major Baron von Moltke, who described the emperor,\r\nempress, and their court in letters to his friends. \"The empress,\"\r\nhe says, \"is of astonishing beauty, with a slight, elegant figure,\r\nand dressing with much taste and richness, but without ostentation.\r\nShe is very talkative and lively,--much more so than is usual with\r\npersons occupying so high a position. The emperor impressed me\r\nby a sort of immobility of features, and the almost extinguished\r\nlook of his eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThis look, by the way, was cultivated by the emperor. When his early\r\nplayfellow, Madame Cornu, saw him after twelve years' separation,\r\nher first exclamation was: \"Why! what have you done to your eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"The prominent characteristic of the emperor's face,\" continues\r\nVon Moltke, \"is a friendly, good-natured smile which has nothing\r\nNapoleonic about it. He mostly sits quietly with his head on one\r\nside, and events have shown that this tranquillity, which is very\r\nimposing to the restless French nation, is not apathy, but a sign\r\nof a superior mind and a strong will. He is an emperor, and not\r\na king.... Affairs in France are not in a normal condition, but\r\nit would be difficult to say how, under present circumstances,\r\nthey could be improved.... Napoleon III. has nothing of the sombre\r\nsternness of his uncle, neither his imperial demeanor nor his deliberate\r\nattitude. He is a quite simple and somewhat small man, whose always\r\ntranquil countenance gives a strong impression of amiability. He\r\nnever gets angry, say the people round him. He is always polite....\r\nHe suffers from a want of men of ability to uphold him. He cannot\r\nmake use of men of independent character, who insist on having\r\ntheir own notions, as the direction of affairs of State must be\r\nconcentrated in his hands. Greater liberty ought to be conceded in\r\na regulated state of society, but in the present state of France\r\nthere must be a strong and single direction, which is, besides,\r\nbest adapted to the French character. Freedom of the Press is for\r\nthe present as impossible here as it would be at the headquarters\r\nof an army in the field if the Press wished to discuss the measures\r\ntaken by the general in command. Napoleon has shown wisdom, firmness,\r\nself-confidence, but also moderation and clemency; and though simple\r\nin his dress, he does not forget that the French people like to\r\nsee their sovereigns surrounded by a brilliant court.\"\r\n\r\nOf the imperial baby in his nurse's arms, on whom the father looked\r\nwith a face radiant with pride and joy, Von Moltke remarks: \"Truly,\r\nhe seems a strapping fellow.\"\r\n\r\nThe little prince grew up a very promising lad. He was his father's\r\nidol. Louis Napoleon never could be brought to give him any sterner\r\nreproof than \"Louis, don't be foolish,--_ne fais pas des bêtises._\"\r\nDiscipline was left to his mother, and it was popularly thought\r\nthat she was much less wrapped up in the child than his father\r\nwas. His especial talent was for drawing and sculpture. Some of\r\nhis sketches, of which fac-similes are given in Jerrold's \"Life\r\nof Napoleon III.,\" are very spirited, and when he could get a lump\r\nof wet clay to play with, he made busts of the persons round him\r\nwhich were excellent likenesses.\r\n\r\nThe emperor's rooms at the Tuileries were rather low and dark,\r\nbut he selected them because they communicated with those of the\r\nempress in the Pavillon de Flore, by a narrow winding staircase.\r\nOften in the day would she come down to him, or he ascend to her.\r\n\r\nHis study was filled with Napoleonic relics, and littered with\r\npolitical and historical papers. He kept a large room with models\r\nof new inventions, which were a great delight to him and to his\r\nson. He was fond of wood-turning, and Thélin and he would often\r\nmake pretty rustic chairs for the park at Saint-Cloud.\r\n\r\nFor some years before his overthrow he was growing very feeble,\r\nand always carried a cane surmounted with a gold eagle. Commonly\r\ntoo some chosen friend, generally Fleury, gave him his arm, but\r\nhe always walked in silence. In the afternoon he would drive out,\r\nand sometimes horrify the police by getting out of his carriage\r\nand walking alone in distant quarters of the city.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion he had a difference of opinion with one of his\r\nfriends, who assured him that if he insisted on planting an open\r\nspace in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine with flowers, and protected\r\nit by no railing, the flowers would very speedily be destroyed.\r\nHis pleasure and exultation were very great when he found he had\r\nbeen right, and that not a flower had been plucked or broken.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was generally gay and ready to converse at table, but\r\nhe made it a rule never to criticise or discuss living persons\r\nhimself, or allow others to do so in his hearing.\r\n\r\nThere was much decorum at court so far as his influence extended\r\nin the imperial circle, but there were plenty of scandals outside\r\nof it; and as to money matters, even Persigny and Fleury--one the\r\nfriend of the emperor for five-and-twenty years, and the other\r\ndevotedly attached to him--could not restrain themselves from cheating\r\nhim and tricking him whenever they could.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMAXIMILIAN AND MEXICO.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Much of the material of this chapter is taken from\r\nVictor Tissot's book of travels in Austria; the chapter on Maximilian\r\nas archduke and emperor I translated from advance-sheets, and it\r\nwas published in the \"Living Age\" under the title \"From Miramar\r\nto Queretaro.\" -E. W. L.]\r\n\r\nMaximilian, Archduke of Austria, was born the same week that his\r\ncousin, the unfortunate son of Napoleon and Marie Louise, had died.\r\nHe grew to manhood handsome, well educated, accomplished, and\r\nenterprising. He had the great gift of always making himself personally\r\nbeloved. The navy was his profession, but his great desire was to\r\nbe made viceroy of the (then) Austrian provinces of Italy. He felt\r\nsure that he could conciliate the Italians, and a great Italian\r\nstatesman is reported to have said that it was well for Italian unity\r\nthat his wish was never granted. His ideas were all liberal, and\r\nopposed to those of Metternich. His family mistrusted his political\r\nopinions, but the Italians, when brought into personal contact\r\nwith him, soon learned to love him. They saw a great deal of him,\r\nfor Trieste and Venice were at that period the naval stations of\r\nthe Austrian Empire. He was, therefore, often in those places,\r\nand finally took up his residence in an earthly paradise upon the\r\nAdriatic, created by himself and called by him Miramar.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1857, when the Indian Mutiny was at its height, though\r\ntidings of it had not yet reached the western world, the Archduke\r\nMaximilian, whom the English royal family had never met, arrived\r\nat Windsor, and was hailed there as one who was soon to become\r\na relative, for he was engaged to King Leopold's only daughter,\r\nthe Princess Charlotte of Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe queen and her husband were charmed with Maximilian. \"He is\r\na young prince,\" writes Prince Albert, \"of whom we hear nothing\r\nbut good, and Charlotte's alliance with him will be one of the\r\nheart. May Heaven's blessing,\" he adds, \"be upon a connection so\r\nhappily begun, and in it may they both find their life's truest\r\nhappiness!\"\r\n\r\nThe queen also wrote to her uncle Leopold,--\r\n\r\n\"The archduke is charming,--so clever, natural, kind, and amiable;\r\nso English in his feelings and likings. With the exception of the\r\nmouth and chin, he is good looking, but I think one does not the\r\nleast care for that, he is so very kind, clever, and pleasant. I\r\nwish you really joy, dearest uncle, at having got such a husband\r\nfor dear Charlotte. I am sure he will make her happy, and do a\r\ngreat deal for Italy.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Albert crossed over to Belgium for the wedding, and wrote\r\nto his wife: \"Charlotte's whole being seems to have been warmed\r\nand unfolded by the love that is kindled in her heart. I have never\r\nseen so rapid a development in the space of one year. She appears\r\nto be happy and devoted to her husband with her whole soul, and\r\neager to make herself worthy of her present position.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of her marriage the princess had just entered her\r\nseventeenth year. The wedding-day was made a little family fête at\r\nWindsor, in spite of Prince Albert's absence. \"The younger children,\"\r\nthe queen writes to her husband, \"are to have a half-holiday. Alice\r\nis to dine with us for the first time, in the evening. We shall\r\ndrink the archduke's and the archduchess's healths, and I have\r\nordered wine for our servants, and grog for our sailors, to do the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nMaximilian had been round the world in his frigate, the \"Novara;\"\r\nhe had travelled into Greece and Asia Minor, he had visited Spain,\r\nPortugal, and Sicily; he had been to Egypt and the Holy Land. He\r\nloved the ocean like a true sailor, and in 1856 he had taken up his\r\nresidence at Trieste, to be near its shores. He would frequently\r\ngo out alone in a light boat, even in rough weather, a dash of\r\ndanger lending excitement to a struggle with the wind and waves.\r\n\r\nOne day in a storm his light craft had been borne like a feather\r\nround Cape Gignano. In a moment it lay at rest under the lee of\r\nthe land. Maximilian landed, and found the spot so charming and the\r\nsea-view so superb that he resolved to build a little villa there\r\nfor fishing. He bought the land at once, and began by setting out\r\nexotics, persuaded that the soil of such a spot would be favorable\r\nto tropical vegetation. A year later he brought his young bride to\r\nthis favored spot, and with a golden wand transformed his bachelor's\r\nfishing-hut into the palace of an emperor.\r\n\r\nAt this period of his life, Maximilian (an author and a poet) was\r\ngreatly interested in architecture. He drew the plans for an exquisite\r\nchurch (now one of the beauties of Vienna), and draughted with his\r\nown hand those for the grounds and castle of Miramar. The work was\r\npushed on rapidly, yet in 1859, when Austria was forced to give up\r\nLombardy, nothing at Miramar was complete except a fancy farm-house\r\non one of the heights of the property. Maximilian, however, made\r\nhis home there with his wife, and they found it so delightful that\r\nwhen at length the castle was ready for occupation, they lingered\r\nin the farmhouse, which they loved as their first home. It was a\r\nlarge Swiss châlet, covered with vines and honeysuckle, surrounded\r\nby groves of camellias and pyrus japonicas. How delicious life\r\nmust have been to the husband and wife in this solitude, fragrant\r\nwith flowers, vocal with the songs of birds, a glory of greenness\r\nround the house, the blue sky overhead, the glittering ocean at\r\ntheir feet, and holy love and loving kindness everywhere around\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nMaximilian's generosity rendered wealth indispensable to his complete\r\nhappiness, for he loved to surround himself with artists, learned\r\nmen, and men of letters. He paid them every kind of attention in\r\nhis power, and did not omit those little gifts which are \"the beads\r\non memory's rosary.\"\r\n\r\n\"One feels how happy life must have been to husband and wife in\r\nthis new Paradise!\" cries M. Victor Tissot. \"Yet it was Paradise\r\nLost before long, for alas! in this, as in the other Paradise,\r\nthe Eve, the sweet young wife, was tempted by ambition. She took\r\nthe apple, ate, and gave it to her husband.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 10, 1864, the Mexican deputies commissioned to offer Maximilian\r\nthe imperial crown, arrived at Miramar. \"We come,\" said Don Gutierrez\r\nde Estrada, \"to beseech you to ascend the throne of Mexico, to which\r\nyou have been called by the voice of a people weary of anarchy\r\nand civil war. We are assured you have the secret of conquering\r\nthe hearts of all men, and excel in the rare knowledge of the art\r\nof government.\"\r\n\r\nMaximilian replied that he was ready to accept the honor offered\r\nhim by the Mexican people, and that his government would be both\r\nliberal and constitutional. \"I shall prove, I trust,\" he said,\r\n\"that liberty may be made compatible with law. I shall respect your\r\nliberties, and uphold order at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nDon Gutierrez thanked the archduke in the name of the Mexican nation,\r\nand then the new emperor swore upon the Gospels to labor for the\r\nhappiness and prosperity of his people, and to protect their independent\r\nnationality. Don Gutierrez was then embraced by Maximilian, who\r\nhung around his neck the cross of the new Order of Guadeloupe,\r\nof which he was the first member.\r\n\r\nBut this acceptance of the imperial crown of Mexico was by no means\r\na sudden thought with Maximilian. For eight months he had been\r\ndebating the matter in his own heart, urged to acceptance of the\r\ncrown by his wife, but dissuaded by his family.\r\n\r\nThe history of the offer, connected as it is with one of Napoleon\r\nIII.'s schemes for extending French influence, must be briefly\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nBefore the Civil War broke out in America, it had already entered\r\nthe head of the emperor that he would like to intermeddle in the\r\naffairs of Mexico. That unhappy country, which the United States\r\nhave been accused of doing their best to keep in a chronic state\r\nof weakness, turbulence, and revolution, had been left to recover\r\nitself after the Mexican War, which had shorn away its fairest\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, Santa Aña, who had been president, dictator, exile, and\r\nconspirator by turns for thirty years, was recalled to Mexico, and\r\na second time was made dictator. He assumed the title of Serene\r\nHighness, and claimed the right to nominate his successor. A popular\r\nrevolution soon unseated him. Juarez, of Indian parentage, was at\r\nits head. The clerical party was outraged by the confiscation of\r\nthe enormous possessions of the Church, and by the abolition of\r\nthe right of _mortmain_ (_i. e._, wills made upon death-beds were\r\npronounced thenceforth invalid, so far as bequests to the Church\r\nwere concerned). Mexico is a country with eighteen hundred miles of\r\ncoast-line, but few harbors. It had in 1860 no railroads, and hardly\r\nany highroads of any kind. Its provinces were semi-independent, its\r\npopulation widely scattered, a large part of it was Indian, a still\r\nlarger portion consisted of half-breeds; pure-blooded Spaniards\r\nwere a small minority. The feeling that stood Mexico in lieu of\r\npatriotism was a keen hatred and jealousy of foreigners. Their\r\nvery pride still keeps the Mexicans from believing that there can\r\nbe anything better than what they possess. Perpetual revolutions\r\nhad educated the people into habits of lawlessness; and as to\r\ndishonesty, rank itself was no guarantee against petty larceny,\r\nwhile in the larger rascalities of peculation, bribe-taking, and\r\npolitical treachery, no nation had ever such opportunities for\r\nexercising its national capacity, nor, apparently, did many Mexicans\r\nhave conscientious scruples as to its display.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is no wonder that foreign bondholders\r\ncomplained loudly to their Governments, or that in the general\r\nconfusion all manner of wrongs to Englishmen, Frenchmen, Austrians,\r\nand Spaniards called loudly for redress. That cry reached the French\r\nemperor's ears. He proposed to England and Spain that as Mexico had\r\nat last got a government under Juarez, an interventionary force\r\nshould appear off her coast, composed of English, French, and Spanish\r\nships-of-war, and that Mexico should be summoned to redress their\r\ncommon wrongs.\r\n\r\nAll this was harmless. The expedition was commanded by the Spanish\r\nGeneral Prim; but under the avowed object of demanding a redress of\r\ngrievances, the Emperor Napoleon concealed a more ambitious aim.\r\nThe United States were at war; all their resources were absorbed\r\nin civil strife. The most sagacious statesmen could not foresee that\r\nthe end of that strife would be to make the country more great,\r\nmore rich, more formidable; and Napoleon thought it was the very\r\nmoment for attacking the Monroe doctrine, and for making, as he\r\nsaid, \"the Latin race hold equal sway with the Anglo-Saxon over the\r\nNew World.\" If he meant by the \"Latin race\" the effete half-Indian,\r\nMexican and South American peoples, which were to be set as rivals\r\nagainst the Anglo-Saxon race, represented by Yankees, Southerners,\r\nmen of the West, and the English in Canada, he was widely wrong in\r\nhis calculation; but it is probable that \"Latin\" was his synonym\r\nfor \"French\" in this connection.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe doctrine, as all Americans know, took its rise from\r\ncertain words in a Presidential message of Mr. Monroe in 1822,\r\nthough they were inserted in the message by Mr. Adams. They were\r\nto the effect that the United States would disturb no nation or\r\ngovernment at present (_i. e._, in 1822) existing on the North or\r\nSouth American continent, but that they would oppose all attempts\r\nby any European Government whatever to put down any free institutions\r\nthat were the choice of the people, or to impose upon them any\r\nform of government against their will.\r\n\r\nNapoleon III. did not quite dare to fly in the face of the Monroe\r\ndoctrine, even though the United States were embarrassed by civil\r\nwar. There were plenty of Mexican exiles in Paris, among them the\r\nDon Gutierrez who offered Maximilian the imperial crown. These men\r\nhad secret interviews with the emperor. Thus the way was paved for\r\nMaximilian long before the time came to act, and possibly before\r\nhe heard of the matter; for there was a power behind the throne\r\nthat was urging his elevation on the French emperor with all a\r\nwoman's persuasive powers.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pierre de Lana.]\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the Empress Eugénie had been left regent\r\nof France, during the campaign of Italy, in 1859, that she took\r\nany part in politics; but from that time her influence was freely\r\nexercised, though she interested herself chiefly in foreign affairs.\r\nShe did not like Victor Emmanuel, nor her husband's policy as regarded\r\nItaly. She dreaded the destruction of the pope's power as a temporal\r\nprince. Her sympathies were Austrian, and in conjunction with her\r\nfriends the Prince and Princess Metternich she lost no opportunity of\r\nurging the establishment of Maximilian and Carlotta on the imperial\r\nthrone of Mexico. She looked upon this as in some sort a compensation\r\ngiven by France to the House of Hapsburg for its losses in Italy.\r\nTo her imagination, the expedition to Mexico seemed like a romance.\r\nShe saw two lovers seated upon Montezuma's throne,--the oldest throne\r\nin the New World,--surrounded by the glories of the tropics. When\r\nthere, they would restore the privileges of the Catholic clergy, and\r\nwould curb the revolutionary aspirations of the mongrel population of\r\nMexico,--a population which, as a Spaniard, she hated and despised.\r\nTo this end she intrigued with all her heart. Indeed, she and her\r\nfriends the Metternichs acted in the preliminary arrangements of\r\nthe plan the part of actual conspirators.\r\n\r\nAfter the French and Spanish forces landed in Mexico, accompanied\r\nby a few Englishmen, Juarez offered to make compensation for the\r\nwrongs complained of, and an agreement was drawn up and signed\r\nby General Prim and the French and English commanders at a place\r\ncalled La Soledad.\r\n\r\nEngland and Spain, when the agreement was sent to Europe for\r\nratification, considered it satisfactory. France, having ulterior\r\ndesigns, repudiated it altogether. The Spaniards and the English\r\ntherefore withdrew their forces, and the French remained to fight\r\nout the quarrel with Juarez alone.\r\n\r\nUp to this time no allusion had been made as to any change in the\r\nMexican government; but now French agents began to intrigue in\r\nfavor of an empire and Maximilian. A small assembly of Mexican\r\nnotables was with great difficulty convened in the city of Mexico,\r\nfrom which Juarez was absent, being engaged in carrying on the\r\nwar. The only persons concerned in this assembly who took any real\r\ninterest in its objects were the clergy, who believed that a prince\r\nof the House of Austria would be likely to restore to them all\r\ntheir property and privileges.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that such a government as Maximilian would\r\nhave established in Mexico would have been a happy thing for that\r\ncountry and for civilization; but it is equally certain that the\r\nMexicans (meaning by that term the great mass of the people) did\r\nnot want such a government. Above all, they did not want for their\r\nruler a foreigner, backed by a foreign potentate. The only _raison\r\nd'être_ for Maximilian's government in any Mexican's mind was not\r\nthat it would bring order and peace into the country, but that\r\nit might bring money from the coffers of the new emperor's ally.\r\nBut when, after a while, the reverse of peace and order was the\r\nresult of this new government, and when the French emperor declined\r\nto advance any more funds, nothing kept any man true to Maximilian\r\nbut the dread of what the party of Juarez might do to him when\r\nthe cause of the emperor should be overthrown.\r\n\r\nWith this explanation we will go back to Miramar, where Maximilian\r\nand Carlotta, unquestionably deceived by the political manipulations\r\nof the French emperor, believed, with joy and pride, that they\r\nwere the choice of the Mexican people, and that they had nothing\r\nto do but to go forth and take possession of the promised land.\r\n\r\nOn April 13, 1864, almost the darkest date during our war for the\r\ncause of the Federal Union, the Archduke Maximilian and his wife\r\nquitted the soil of Austria.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, in the port of Trieste and on the road to\r\nMiramar, all were astir. Friends from all parts of the Austrian\r\nEmpire were hastening to bid farewell to the Archduke whom they\r\nloved.\r\n\r\nThe \"Novara\" and the French frigate \"Thémis\" were lying off Trieste,\r\nready to start; and near them, riding at anchor, were six steamships\r\nbelonging to the Austrian Lloyds, full of spectators.\r\n\r\nAt about one o'clock P. M. the emperor, with his wife leaning on\r\nhis arm, entered the town-hall of Trieste, where about twenty\r\ndeputations were assembled to offer him farewell addresses. Maximilian\r\nwas much moved, and when the burgomaster spoke of the grief that\r\nall the people of the city would feel at his departure, he burst\r\ninto tears. He embraced the burgomaster, shook hands with those\r\nabout him, and whispered, as if to himself: \"Something tells me\r\nthat I shall never see this dear country more.\" His sensitive and\r\npoetic nature was very susceptible to sad presentiments; his book\r\nteems with them.\r\n\r\nAfter the leave-taking, their Majesties entered the magnificent\r\nbarge prepared for their use by the city of Trieste; a salute of\r\none hundred guns reverberated from the sides of the mountain, while\r\ntwenty thousand hats and handkerchiefs waved a sad farewell.\r\n\r\nMaximilian and Carlotta embarked on board the \"Novara,\" which carried\r\nthe Mexican flag. By four o'clock both vessels were well down in\r\nthe offing, and not till then did the crowd separate. Those with\r\ntelescopes had seen up to the last moment a figure standing on\r\nthe poop-deck, with its face turned towards Miramar, and knew it\r\nfor the form of Maximilian.\r\n\r\nThe \"Novara\" touched at Jamaica. On May 28 it came in sight of\r\nthe shores of Mexico, and cast anchor in the harbor of Vera Cruz.\r\n\r\nThe emperor and empress had expected a public reception. There\r\nwas nothing of the kind. No welcome awaited them,--not even an\r\nofficial one. This was the more extraordinary because the \"Thémis\"\r\nhad been sent forward to announce the approach of the imperial\r\nparty. Their disappointment at the want of enthusiasm was great.\r\nThe French vice-admiral did his best to repair unfortunate omissions.\r\nHe gave orders for a show of festivity; but it was plain to see,\r\nfrom the indifference of the people in the streets, that they had\r\nno part or lot in the demonstration.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the sea-coast, Maximilian proceeded towards his capital\r\nin an old shabby English barouche, his journey seeming rather like\r\nthe expedition of an adventurer than the progress of an emperor.\r\nPassing through Orizaba and Puebla, the emperor and empress entered\r\nMexico on June 12. French agents had paid for flowers to be scattered\r\nin their path, and a theatrical kind of procession was prepared,\r\nwhich was not agreeable to either of them. The only part of the\r\npopulation which hailed their coming with delight were the descendants\r\nof the Aztecs, many of whom appeared on the occasion in feather\r\ndresses preserved in their families since the time of Montezuma.\r\nIn the evening there was a public performance at the theatre in\r\nhonor of the new sovereigns, but not half the boxes were filled.\r\n\r\nThe palace of Chapultepec, which had been assigned them as their\r\nresidence, was destitute of comforts of any kind, and was much\r\nmore like a second-class hotel than a habitation meet for princes.\r\nYet even here, one of Maximilian's first cares was to layout the\r\ngrounds and to plant flowers.\r\n\r\nHe was advised to make an immediate journey through his new dominions,\r\nin order to judge for himself of the aspirations and resources of\r\nthe people. But he found a country broken down by war, without\r\nroads, without schools, without agriculture. \"The only thing in\r\nthis country which is well organized, sire,\" said a Mexican whom\r\nhe was questioning about the state of things, \"is robbery.\"\r\n\r\nThere was thieving everywhere. The emperor's palace, and even his\r\nprivate apartments, were not spared. One day, after a reception\r\nof officers high in military command, his revolver, inlaid with\r\ngold and ivory, which had lain on a table by his side, disappeared,\r\nand the empress missed two watches, which had gone astray under\r\nthe dexterous fingering of her maids-of-honor. General Lopez, who\r\nwas then commandant of the palace, wishing to give the emperor a\r\nproof of the accomplishments of his subjects in matters of this\r\nkind, offered to steal off his writing-table, within two hours, and\r\nwithout being noticed, any object agreed upon. He said he believed\r\nhe could even carry off the table,--a joke at which the emperor\r\nlaughed heartily.\r\n\r\nWhen Maximilian returned to his capital, after a journey of great\r\nperil, he ordered the construction of several high-roads, granted\r\nlands and privileges to two or three railroad companies, founded a\r\ngood many schools, and set on foot a Mexican Academy of Sciences.\r\nHis own taste for natural history was so great that he gave some\r\nfoundation for the charge made against him that he would frequently\r\nshut himself up in his workroom to stuff birds. He devoted great\r\nattention to improvements in agriculture, and planned a manufacturing\r\ncity, and a seaport on the Gulf of Mexico which he intended to\r\ncall Miramar.\r\n\r\nHis wife was an indefatigable helpmeet. She wrote all his European\r\ncorrespondence, but resented the interference of the French, and could\r\nbe curt and energetic when the occasion called for self-assertion.\r\n\r\nAn American gentleman who saw her at a court-ball at this period\r\nthus describes her: \"She was imperial in every look and action.\r\nThe dignified and stately step so well suited to her station, and\r\nwith _her_ perfectly natural, would have seemed affectation in\r\nanother. She did not seem remarkably tall, except in comparison\r\nwith others. Her voice possessed a refinement peculiar to birth,\r\neducation, and superior natures.\"\r\n\r\nBut while the emperor and empress were laboring for the improvement\r\nof their realm, the Juarists were increasing in strength, and banditti\r\ncarried on their enterprises with impunity up to the very gates\r\nof Mexico. Day after day the stage was robbed between Mexico and\r\nJalapa. The Marquis de Radepont, a quiet traveller, saved himself by\r\nkilling half-a-dozen highwaymen with his revolver; but the Belgian\r\nambassador, on his way to announce to their Imperial Majesties the\r\naccession of Leopold II., the brother of Carlotta, was robbed of\r\nall his jewelry and money.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these disorders the emperor signed, on Oct. 3,\r\n1865, in spite of the remonstrances of Marshal Bazaine, the French\r\ngeneral-in-chief in Mexico, an order to the civil and military\r\nauthorities to treat all armed guerilla bands as brigands, and to\r\napply to them the utmost rigor of martial law.\r\n\r\nThis was at once interpreted into permission to shoot all prisoners;\r\nand three promising young Juarist generals who had fallen into the\r\nhands of one of Maximilian's commanders were shot immediately,\r\nleaving behind them pathetic farewell letters to their friends.\r\nMaximilian did not foresee that he was signing his own death-warrant\r\nwhen he put his hand to this act of severity.\r\n\r\nJuarez himself, with a body of his followers, had retreated to\r\nthe frontier, ready to pass over into Texas if the French attacked\r\nhim. But the French were too few and too scattered to occupy a\r\nvast region of country where every inhabited house was a refuge\r\nfor their foes. Moreover, the interest of Napoleon in the empire\r\nof Mexico was at an end. He hated a long war at any time, and was\r\nalways ready to abandon an enterprise when he could not carry out\r\nhis projects by a _coup de main_. The war was extremely unpopular\r\nin France. Financial ruin had come upon many Frenchmen from the\r\nfailure of the Mexican bonds negotiated by the banker, Jecker, to\r\npay interest to their bond-holders. The Civil War in the United\r\nStates was at an end, and Mr. Seward was instructing the American\r\nambassador in Paris to threaten the Emperor Napoleon with the\r\nenforcement of the doctrine of President Monroe. He resolved to\r\nwithdraw his troops from Mexico, and to advance no more money to\r\nMaximilian. He wrote these orders to Marshal Bazaine.\r\n\r\nMaximilian, who fully understood by this time the condition of\r\nMexico, and foresaw all the dangers of his position when the French\r\ntroops should be withdrawn, sent the empress at this crisis to\r\nEurope to represent the situation of affairs to the French emperor,\r\nand to remind him of his promises.\r\n\r\nShe embarked hurriedly and like a private person on board a French\r\nmail-steamer. Her stateroom was close to the propeller. The noise,\r\ncoupled with her great anxiety and excitement, deprived her almost\r\nentirely of sleep during the voyage. On landing, she hastened to\r\nParis, went to an hotel, and sent a message to the emperor, requesting\r\nan interview. This the emperor declined. Carlotta then hired a\r\ncarriage and drove out to Saint-Cloud, where she insisted on seeing\r\nhim. Their interview was very painful. At its close she exclaimed\r\nthat she felt herself to blame, being a daughter of the house of\r\nOrleans, for ever having put faith in the Emperor Napoleon or his\r\npromises. Notwithstanding this reproach, the emperor, who was\r\nsoft-hearted, pitied her extremely. She remained at Saint-Cloud\r\nfor some hours, and that evening, when surrounded by the court\r\ncircle, she threw back her head and begged for water. The emperor\r\nhastened to bring it to her with his own hand; but she exclaimed\r\nthat she would not take it from him, for she knew he wished to\r\npoison her. It was her first attack of mania. She was calmed, and\r\nthe symptoms passed off, but continued at intervals to return.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris she went to Rome, and there her mental malady more and\r\nmore declared itself. She refused to eat anything but fruit, for\r\nfear of poison. Her first visit to the pope was made while he was\r\nbreakfasting, when she snatched the cup of chocolate from his lips\r\nand swallowed it eagerly, exclaiming: \"I am sure no one can have\r\nwished to poison you!\" After several other manifestations of her\r\ndisordered brain at the Quirinal, steps were taken to forward her\r\nto Miramar. On reaching that beloved place, she grew more calm.\r\nShe recovered for a time her interest in music, painting, and\r\nliterature. The Sclavic peasants around her considered her a saint.\r\nWhen she passed, they used to kneel down on the highway. For years\r\nthey refused to believe in Maximilian's death. \"He will come back!\r\nWe know he will come back!\" was the cry of the Dalmatians, who\r\ncherished his memory.\r\n\r\nAfter a time Carlotta was removed to Belgium, where she has been\r\nsince secluded from the world, but tenderly watched over by her\r\nrelations. From time to time she partially recovers her reason.\r\n\r\nMatters in Mexico after her departure grew worse every day. Bazaine\r\nhad received orders to withdraw all French troops from the country.\r\nHe was directed to withhold from Maximilian all French support,\r\nand in obedience to these instructions he flung into the river\r\nSequia and Lake Texcoco[1] all the guns and ammunition he could\r\nnot take away.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Prince Salm-Salm, Diary in Mexico.]\r\n\r\nPrior to the withdrawal of the French troops, the French Government\r\nmade several efforts to induce Maximilian to abdicate. The Marquis\r\nde Gallifet (of whom we shall hear again in another chapter) was\r\nsent, with two other French gentlemen, to urge him to leave Mexico.\r\n\"I know all the difficulties of my position,\" Maximilian replied,\r\n\"but I shall not give up my post. A son of the house of Hapsburg\r\nnever retreats in the face of danger.\" Nevertheless, after receiving\r\nthe first letters from his wife, Maximilian's resolution was shaken.\r\nHe hoped at least to return to Europe as an emperor, and not a\r\nfugitive, and to lay aside his crown of his own accord. With this\r\nview he set out for Orizaba, where the \"Dandolo\" corvette was waiting\r\nto receive his orders. On his way he was delayed some hours, because\r\nthe white mules that drew his carriage had been stolen.\r\n\r\nAt Orizaba he was attacked by malarious chills. There, too, he\r\nreceived news of his wife's insanity. Some of his generals surrounded\r\nhim, and prayed him not to abandon his followers to the vengeance\r\nof their enemies. The leaders of the clerical party also begged\r\nhim, for the sake of the Church, to return to Mexico, promising\r\nhim the support of the clergy throughout the country if he would\r\nbut give up liberal ideas, and support, at all costs, the temporal\r\nprosperity of the Church.\r\n\r\nMaximilian, on the strength of these assurances, went back to his\r\ncapital, protesting that he remained only for the good of other\r\npeople, and was influenced neither by personal considerations nor\r\npolitical wishes of his own.\r\n\r\nBut Maximilian was not the man to contend with the difficulties\r\nthat beset him in Mexico. His very merits were against him. As\r\nwe read the sad history of his failure, we feel that in his hands\r\nthe regeneration of Mexico was hopeless. Men like John or Henry\r\nLawrence, heroes of the Indian Mutiny, accustomed to deal with\r\nsemi-savages, might perhaps have succeeded; but Maximilian was\r\nthe product of an advanced civilization, and all his sentiments\r\nwere of a super-refined character. He was no general; his forces\r\nwere kept scattered over an immense area. He seems to have been\r\nno administrator. He was accustomed to deal with Italians,--men\r\nof enthusiastic natures and fanatical ideas. Mexicans had no\r\nenthusiasms; and in place of patriotism there was a prevailing\r\nsentiment of thorough aversion to the French and to the foreigners\r\nthey had brought with them. Maximilian had come to Mexico with\r\nall kinds of liberal projects for its civilization. It was like\r\nforcing sanitary improvements on the inhabitants of an Irish shanty,\r\nor catching a street _gamin_ and imposing on him the restraints\r\nand amenities of high-class culture.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the French troops left the way clear for the party\r\nof Juarez. It rapidly gained strength, and prepared to besiege the\r\nemperor in his capital. \"I cannot bear to expose the city to danger,\"\r\nsaid Maximilian, who, in spite of being continually harassed and\r\ncruelly deceived day after day, never failed in consideration for\r\nthose about him. He retired to Queretaro, where Generals Miramon,\r\nCastillo, Mejia, Avellano, and Prince Salm-Salm had gathered a\r\nlittle army of about eight thousand men.\r\n\r\nMaximilian at Queretaro showed all his nobleness of spirit, kindness\r\nof heart, and simplicity of life. During the siege, which lasted\r\nover two months, he shared the fatigues and privations of his common\r\nsoldiers, and lived as they did, on the flesh of mules, while his\r\nofficers' tables were much better supplied. He exposed his person\r\nupon all occasions, taking daily walks upon the bastions as tranquilly\r\nas he might have done in the green alleys of his distant home. One\r\nday his eye fell upon six dead bodies dangling from the branches\r\nof six trees. He turned away, with intense emotion. They were the\r\nbodies of six of his own couriers, who had fallen into the hands\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nHe might have cut his way out of Queretaro at the head of his cavalry,\r\nbut he hesitated to abandon his foot-soldiers. \"I will die sword\r\nin hand,\" were now his daily words.\r\n\r\nEvery day his men brought in prisoners. Even when such persons\r\nwere suspected of being spies, Maximilian would not order their\r\nexecution. \"No, no,\" he said; \"if things go well, there is no need;\r\nif ill, I shall not have their blood upon my soul.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the siege had lasted seventy days, provisions grew so scarce\r\nthat the only alternatives seemed a sortie or a surrender. The\r\nsortie was decided on. On the night of May 14, 1867, the seven\r\nthousand men still in Queretaro were to break through the lines of\r\nthe enemy and endeavor to make their way to Vera Cruz. Singularly\r\nenough, the Juarist general, Escobedo, had fixed on the 15th of\r\nMay for his final assault.\r\n\r\nNeither sortie nor assault took place. The treason of General Lopez\r\nprevented the one, and rendered the other unnecessary. Lopez, whom\r\nMaximilian had loaded with all sorts of kindness,--Lopez, who called\r\nhimself the most devoted adherent of the emperor,--had sold the\r\nlife of his friend and benefactor for two thousand ounces of gold!\r\n\r\nOne year before, when Lopez had been at Puebla in attendance on\r\nthe empress, he had sent for his wife, who, having made a hurried\r\njourney, was prematurely confined. \"I cannot allow your son,\" wrote\r\nMaximilian, \"to come into the world in another man's house. I send\r\nyou the I enclosed sum. Purchase the house where your son was born.\"\r\n\r\nHaving kept up constant communication with the camp of the besiegers,\r\nLopez, on the morning of May 13, sent a note to Escobedo, offering to\r\ndeliver over to him the convent of La Cruz, which was the emperor's\r\nheadquarters. Escobedo accepted his proposals. About midnight Lopez\r\nand the troops under his command went over to the enemy. The soldiers\r\nof Juarez quietly entered the town, and surrounded the convent\r\nwhere the emperor and his staff were sleeping.\r\n\r\nAt dawn Maximilian rose, dressed himself, woke Prince Salm-Salm,\r\nand they went out together, with no arms but their swords. As they\r\nreached the gates of the convent the emperor perceived Juarist\r\nsoldiers on guard, and turning to his companion, cried, \"We are\r\nbetrayed; here is the enemy!\" At this moment Lopez, who had seen\r\nthem come into the court-yard, pointed out the emperor to Colonel\r\nRincon Gallardo, who was in command of the detachment from the army\r\nof Juarez. Rincon was an honorable soldier and kind-hearted. He\r\nsaid, loud enough to be heard by his own men: \"They are citizens;\r\nlet them pass: they are not soldiers.\" The emperor was dressed in\r\na black frock-coat, but with military trousers and epaulettes.\r\nHe and Prince Salm-Salm then walked through the convent gates and\r\nmade their way in haste to the opposite quarter of the city. The\r\nstreets were silent and empty. Suddenly a sharp fire of musketry\r\nwas heard, mingled with Juarist and Imperial war-cries. Miramon\r\nwith his troops was holding one of the widest streets of Queretaro,\r\nwhen a ball hit him in the face. He fell, half blinded, and was\r\ntaken prisoner. Miramon was the son of a French father and a Spanish\r\nmother, and was one of the very few generals on either side who\r\nwere of pure white blood.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, with Generals Mejia, Castillo, Avellano, and Prince\r\nSalm-Salm, retired to a little hill which commanded the city. They\r\nhad no artillery, no means of defending their position. They stood\r\non the bare rock where they had taken refuge, like shipwrecked\r\nsailors waiting for the fatal rising of the tide. General Escobedo,\r\na coarse man, who had formerly been a muleteer, prepared to charge\r\nup the hill with four battalions of infantry and a strong party\r\nof cavalry.\r\n\r\n\"Do not fire; you will shed blood to no purpose,\" said the emperor\r\nto the little band of followers who surrounded him. Then, in a\r\nlow, sad voice, he ordered one of his aides-de-camp to fasten a\r\nwhite handkerchief on the end of a bayonet. The Juarists, who were\r\nascending the hill, came to a halt. Then, amid profound silence,\r\nthe emperor came forward. He paused a moment as he stepped out\r\nof the little group of his followers and looked around him. Then\r\nhe descended the hill with a firm step, followed by several of\r\nhis generals.\r\n\r\nThe Juarists saluted him by their party cry, \"Viva la libertad!\"\r\nThey recognized the emperor. Maximilian walked straight up to their\r\ncommander, an ex-Federal United States officer, who under the name\r\nof Corona was in command of a party of Americans who had entered\r\nthe service of Juarez, and were called the Legion of Honor. This\r\nlegion was composed of fifty men. Some had worn the blue, and some\r\nthe gray. Each held rank in the Mexican army as an officer.\r\n\r\n\"General,\" said Maximilian to Corona, \"both men and fortune have\r\nbetrayed me. There are widows and orphans enough already in the\r\nworld. Here is my sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said the general, forgetting that the man who addressed\r\nhim was no longer emperor, \"keep your sword.\" He then proposed\r\nto Maximilian to mount a horse, and escorted him, with the other\r\nprisoners, to the convent of Santa Teresita.\r\n\r\nThere the emperor and his generals were shut up at once in a dark\r\ncellar, and not only had to sleep upon the damp earth floor, but\r\nwere left to suffer from hunger. In a few days, however, Princess\r\nSalm-Salm brought them some relief. They were then transferred to\r\nthe convent of La Capuchina, and their friends obtained permission\r\nto send them wine, clothes, and provisions.\r\n\r\nPrincess Salm-Salm, in the last act of this tragedy, showed herself\r\nto be a brave and generous woman. When her husband left the capital\r\nshe had crossed the enemy's lines in order to get out of Mexico,\r\nbut was twice in danger of being shot by the soldiers of Diaz.\r\nShe was accused of supplying money to a troop of Austrian soldiers\r\nwho, having been captured, were confined at Chapultepec, and she\r\nwas imprisoned at Guadalupe. After a short detention, however,\r\nshe obtained leave to quit Mexico for Europe; but changing her\r\nroute, she managed to rejoin her husband at Queretaro. Thence,\r\nhiding by day and travelling by night, she made her way back to\r\nSan Luis de Potosi, where Juarez had his headquarters. She threw\r\nherself at his feet, and implored his mercy for the emperor; but\r\nJuarez told her (not without some signs of compassion) that he\r\nfelt no inclination to spare his life, and that if he were willing\r\nto do so, he would not be permitted by his followers to show him\r\nany clemency.\r\n\r\nWhen Maximilian heard of this brave enterprise on his behalf, he\r\ncould not refrain from tears.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were three weeks at La Capuchina, in complete uncertainty\r\nas to what would be done with them. Indeed, the Juarists seemed much\r\nembarrassed by their prize. On June 10 they were informed that\r\nJuarez had sent an order to have them tried by a court-martial,\r\nwhich would be held on the 12th of June.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going to take me?\" asked Maximilian on that day of\r\nthe officer who came to escort him. \"To the court-martial,\" was\r\nthe reply. \"Where is it held?\" said Maximilian. \"In the theatre.\"\r\n\"Then I refuse to accompany you. I will not be made a public spectacle\r\nat a theatre. You may go alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer, not being authorized to use force, went away. The\r\ntrial proceeded without the presence of the prisoner. Generals\r\nMiramon and Mejia, however, were dragged upon the stage where the\r\ncourt-martial was sitting. The play-house was crowded with spectators.\r\nIt was a tragedy with no admission-fee. The proceedings lasted\r\nthree days. The emperor was accused of usurpation, of instigating\r\ncivil war, and of causing the death of forty thousand patriots,\r\nhanged or shot in consequence of his order of October 3, intended\r\nto operate only against armed bands of robbers.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 15, 1867, General Escobedo presented himself\r\nin the prison, holding the sentence of the court-martial in his\r\nhand. Maximilian, who could guess his fate, said quietly: \"Read\r\nit, General; I am ready to hear you.\"\r\n\r\nMaximilian, Miramon, and Mejia were condemned to be shot.\r\n\r\n\"I understand you,\" said the emperor, with perfect calmness. \"The\r\nlaw of October 3 was made to put down robbers: this sentence is\r\nthe work of murderers.\"\r\n\r\nEscobedo laid his hand on his revolver with a sudden exclamation.\r\nThen, recovering himself, he said sarcastically: \"I suppose that\r\na criminal must be allowed the right to vilify his judges.\"\r\n\r\nMaximilian turned his back on him, and Escobedo left the prison.\r\n\r\nThe execution had been ordered for the next morning, but was put\r\noff till the 19th, by order of Juarez.\r\n\r\nMeantime the English and Prussian ambassadors hastened to Juarez,\r\nhoping to obtain mercy for the late emperor. The French and Austrian\r\ncourts, by telegraph, implored the mediation of the United States.\r\nThere was no American minister at that time in Mexico, but Mr.\r\nSeward sent telegraphic despatches to Juarez, pointing out that the\r\nexecution of Maximilian would rouse the feelings of the civilized\r\nworld against the Mexican Republic.\r\n\r\nAll was of no avail. The idea of foreign intervention in the affairs\r\nof Mexico was so distasteful to the Mexicans that these pleadings on\r\nthe late emperor's behalf by foreign Governments only accelerated\r\nhis fate.\r\n\r\nDuring the night before his death, Maximilian asked his jailers\r\nfor a pair of scissors. He was refused. Then he implored one of\r\nthem to cut off a lock of his hair. When that was done, he wrote\r\nthe following pathetic letter to Carlotta:--\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED CARLOTTA,--If God should permit you one\r\nof these days to get well enough to read these lines, you will\r\nknow how sad has been my fate ever since your departure.\r\nYou took with you my happiness, my very life, and my good\r\nfortune. Why did I not take your advice? So many sad things\r\nhave taken place, so many unexpected catastrophes and\r\nundeserved misfortunes have fallen on me, that I have now lost\r\nheart and hope, and look upon death as my good angel.\r\nMy death will be sharp and sudden, without pain. I shall fall\r\ngloriously, like a soldier, like a conquered sovereign....\r\nIf you cannot, dearest, bear up under your load of sorrow,\r\nif God in His mercy soon reunites us by your death, I will\r\nbless His fatherly hand, which now seems very heavy upon\r\nme. Adieu, adieu!\r\n                                              YOUR POOR MAX.\r\n\r\nHe kissed this letter, folded into it the light silky lock of his\r\nown hair, and placed it with other letters which he had written\r\nto his mother and friends. They were all in French, and written\r\nin a clear, firm, regular hand. His noble nature shone in every\r\nline. They give the key to the irresistible personal sympathy he\r\ninspired in all who knew him. His enemies were aware of this, and\r\nno judge or general who had ever known him sat on his court-martial.\r\n\r\nAs six o'clock was striking on the morning of June 19, the door\r\nof the prison was unbarred. \"I am ready,\" said Maximilian.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped forth from the door of the convent, he exclaimed:\r\n\"What a beautiful morning! I have always fancied I should like\r\nto die in sunshine,--on a summer day.\"\r\n\r\nHe entered the carriage in waiting. Miramon and Mejia followed\r\nhim, with the priest who attended them in their last moments. They\r\nwere escorted by a body of four thousand men, and were driven to\r\nthe same rocky height on which they had been captured, called the\r\nCerro della Campana. They sat upright in the carriage during the\r\ndrive, with proud smiles upon their faces. They were carefully\r\ndressed, as if for an occasion of festivity. The population of\r\nthe place was all abroad to see them pass, and looked at them with\r\nsilent pity and admiration. The calmness and self-possession of the\r\nemperor, about to die, touched even the most indifferent spectators.\r\nThe women freely shed tears.\r\n\r\nMaximilian was a handsome, striking-looking man. His beautiful light\r\nhair was parted by a straight line from his forehead to the nape\r\nof his neck. His blue eyes were clear and soft, with a beseeching\r\nlook in them. His hands were beautifully white, his fingers elegant\r\nand taper.\r\n\r\nAs they neared the place of execution, General Mejia suddenly turned\r\npale, covered his face, and with a sob fell back in his place in the\r\ncarriage. He had caught sight of his wife, agonized, dishevelled,\r\nwith her baby in her arms, and all the appearance of a madwoman.\r\n\r\nThe party arrived at the foot of the little hill. The emperor sprang\r\nout, brushed off some dust which had settled on his clothes, and\r\ngoing up to the firing party, gave each man an ounce of gold. \"Take\r\ngood aim, my friends,\" he said. \"Do not, if possible, hit me in\r\nthe face, but shoot right at my heart.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the soldiers wept. Maximilian went to him, and putting his\r\ncigar-case, of silver filigree, into his hand, said: \"Keep that,\r\nmy friend, in remembrance of me. It was given to me by a prince\r\nmore fortunate than I am now.\"\r\n\r\nThe non-commissioned officer then came near, and said he hoped\r\nthat he would forgive him. \"My good fellow,\" replied Maximilian,\r\ncheerfully, \"a soldier has but to obey orders; his duty is to do\r\nhis duty.\"\r\n\r\nThen, turning to Miramon and Mejia, he said: \"Let me, true friends,\r\nembrace you for the last time!\" He did so, and then added: \"In a\r\nfew minutes we shall be together in a better world.\"\r\n\r\nTurning to Miramon, he said: \"General, the bravest man should have\r\nthe place of honor. Take mine.\"\r\n\r\nMejia being very much cast down by the sad spectacle presented\r\nby his poor, distracted wife, Maximilian again pressed his hands,\r\nsaying: \"God will not abandon our suffering survivors. For those\r\nwho die unjustly, things will be set right in another world.\"\r\n\r\nThe drums began to beat. The end was near. Maximilian stepped forward,\r\nmounted on a stone, and addressed the spectators.\r\n\r\n\"Mexicans! men of my rank and of my race, who feel as I feel, must\r\neither be the benefactors of the people over whom they reign, or\r\nmartyrs. It was no rash ambition of my own that called me hither;\r\nyou, you yourselves, invited me to accept your throne. Before dying,\r\nlet me tell you that with all the powers I possess I sought your\r\ngood. Mexicans! may my blood be the last blood that you shed; may\r\nMexico, the unhappy country of my adoption, be happy when I am\r\ngone!\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had resumed his place, a sergeant came up to order\r\nMiramon and Mejia to turn round. As traitors, they were to be shot\r\nin the back.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, dear friends,\" said Maximilian, and crossing his arms,\r\nhe stood firm as a statue.\r\n\r\nWhen the command was given: \"Shoulder arms!\" a murmur of protestation,\r\naccompanied by threats, rose among part of the crowd, in which there\r\nwere many Indians. Their national superstitions and traditions\r\nhad attached this simple people to the emperor. They had a prophecy\r\namong them that one day a white man would come over the seas to set\r\nthem free, and many of them looked for this savior in Maximilian.\r\n\r\nThe officers in command turned towards the crowd, shaking their\r\nswords. Then came the words: \"Take aim! Fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live Mexico!\" cried Miramon.\r\n\r\n\"Carlotta! Poor Carlotta!\" exclaimed Maximilian.\r\n\r\nWhen the smoke of the volley had cleared away, three corpses lay\r\nupon the earth. That of the emperor had received five balls. The\r\nvictims were placed in coffins which lay ready near the place of\r\nexecution, and, escorted as they had been before, were carried\r\nback to the convent of the Capuchins.\r\n\r\n\"The emperor being dead, we will do all honor to the corpse of\r\nthe Archduke of Austria,\" said Colonel Miguel Palacios, to whom\r\nthis care was given. The corpse was embalmed, and the body placed\r\nin a vault.\r\n\r\nThe Russian ambassador, Baron Magnus, and the American commander\r\nof a United States vessel of war which layoff Vera Cruz, in vain\r\nsolicited the body of the late emperor. The Austrian Vice-admiral\r\nTegethoff (the illustrious conqueror at Lissa) had to come and\r\npersonally demand it in November of the next year. He at the same\r\ntime time obtained the release of the Austrian soldiers still retained\r\nas prisoners, and of Prince Salm-Salm, lying under sentence of\r\ndeath since the execution of the emperor.\r\n\r\nAs for the traitor Lopez, instead of the two thousand ounces of\r\ngold that he expected, he got only seven thousand dollars. His\r\nwife refused to live with him after his treachery to Maximilian;\r\nand once when he went to see General Rincon Gallardo to request\r\nhis influence to get himself restored to his former rank in the\r\nMexican army, which he had forfeited by his connection with the\r\nImperial Government, the answer he received was: \"Colonel Lopez,\r\nif I ever recommend you for any place, that place will be under\r\na tree, with a rope round your neck tied to one of its branches.\"\r\n\r\nMaximilian will live in history as a good man and a martyred sovereign.\r\nLong after his death, the Indians in Queretaro would not put up\r\nan adobe hut without inserting in it a pebble from the hill on\r\nwhich he was executed.\r\n\r\nOn the very day of his death an order signed by him was received\r\nin Europe, not for rifled cannon, not for needle-guns, but for\r\ntwo thousand nightingales, which he desired to have purchased in\r\nthe Tyrol to add to the attractions of his empire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _EMPEROR NAPOLEON III._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR AND EMPRESS AT THE SUMMIT OF PROSPERITY.\r\n\r\nThe visit paid by the Emperor Napoleon and the Empress Eugénie to\r\nQueen Victoria at Windsor in 1856 was returned in 1857.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 18th of August that the queen, her husband, the Prince\r\nof Wales, then a boy of fourteen, and the Princess Royal landed\r\nat Boulogne. The royal yacht had been in sight since daybreak,\r\nthe emperor anxiously watching it from the shore; but it was two\r\nP. M. before it was moored to the _quai_. There can be no better\r\naccount of this visit than that given by Queen Victoria. The following\r\nextracts are taken from her journal:--\r\n\r\n\"At last the bridge was adjusted, the emperor stepped across. I\r\nmet him half-way, and embraced him twice, after which he led me\r\non shore amid acclamations, salutes, and every sound of joy and\r\nrespect. The weather was perfect, the harbor crowded with war-ships,\r\nthe town and the heights were decorated with gay colors.\"\r\n\r\nThe delay in getting up to the wharf postponed the queen's entrance\r\ninto Paris, and greatly disappointed the crowds who waited for\r\nher coming. They were also disappointed that the greatest lady\r\nin the world exhibited no magnificence in costume. But the queen\r\nherself was greatly impressed by her first view of Paris:--\r\n\r\n\"The approaching twilight rather added to the beauty of the scene;\r\nand it was still quite light enough when we passed down the Boulevard\r\nde Strasbourg (the emperor's own creation) and along the Boulevards\r\nby the Porte Saint-Denis, the Madeleine, the Place de la Concorde,\r\nand the Arch of Triumph, to see the objects round us.\"\r\n\r\nThey drove through the Bois de Boulogne in the dusk to the palace\r\nof Saint-Cloud; but all the way was lined with troops, and bands\r\nplaying \"God Save the Queen,\" at intervals. The queen was particularly\r\nimpressed by the Zouaves, \"The friends,\" she says (for the Crimean\r\nWar was then in progress), \"of my dear Guards in the Crimea.\"\r\n\r\nThe birth of the Prince Imperial being an event in prospect, the\r\nempress was not allowed to fatigue herself, and first met the queen\r\non the latter's arrival at Saint-Cloud. \"In all the blaze of lamps\r\nand torches,\" says the queen, \"amidst the roar of cannon, and bands,\r\nand drums, and cheers, we reached the palace. The empress, with\r\nPrincess Mathilde and the ladies, received us at the door, and took\r\nus up a beautiful staircase, lined with magnificent soldiers....\r\nI felt quite bewildered, but enchanted.\"\r\n\r\nAt dinner General Canrobert, who was fresh from the Crimea, was\r\nplaced next to her Majesty, and gave her his war experiences. Next\r\nday the royal party went to the Exposition Universelle, then going\r\non in Paris, and afterwards, while the queen was receiving the\r\nambassadors, the emperor drove the Prince of Wales through the\r\nstreets of Paris; he afterwards took his older guests sight-seeing\r\nin his capital. \"As we crossed the Pont de Change,\" writes the\r\nqueen, \"the emperor said, pointing to the Conciergerie, 'That is\r\nwhere I was in prison.\" He alluded to the time when he was brought\r\nfrom Strasburg to Paris, before being shipped for Rio Janeiro.\r\n\"Strange,\" continues the queen, \"to be driving with us as emperor\r\nthrough the streets of Paris in triumph!\"\r\n\r\nThey visited Versailles (where the queen sketched), and afterwards\r\nwent to the Grand Opera. They saw Paris illuminated that night\r\nas they drove back to Saint-Cloud, the emperor and Prince Albert\r\nrecalling old German songs; and the queen says: \"The emperor seems\r\nvery fond of his old recollections of Germany. There is much that\r\nis German, and very little--nothing, in fact--markedly French in\r\nhis character.\"\r\n\r\nOne day all the royal party went out in a hack carriage, with what\r\nthe queen calls \"common bonnets and veils,\" and drove incognito\r\nround Paris. Sometimes they talked politics, sometimes they seem\r\nto have joked and laughed with childish glee and enjoyment; and one\r\nnight the emperor took the queen by torchlight to see the tomb of\r\nhis great uncle at the Invalides. A guard of old warriors who had\r\nserved under Napoleon, with Santini, his valet at St. Helena, at\r\ntheir head, escorted the queen of England to the chapel where stood\r\nNapoleon's coffin, not yet entombed, with the sword of Austerlitz\r\nlying upon it. The band in the chapel was playing \"God Save the\r\nQueen,\" while without raged a sudden thunder-storm.\r\n\r\nThe mornings were devoted to quiet pleasures and sight-seeing,\r\nthe evenings to operas, state dinners, and state balls. The great\r\nball given on this occasion in the galleries of Versailles was\r\ntalked of in Paris for years after. \"The empress,\" says the queen,\r\n\"met us at the top of the staircase, looking like a fairy-queen or\r\nnymph, in a white dress trimmed with bunches of grass and diamonds,\r\na beautiful _tour de corsage_ of diamonds round the top of her\r\ndress, and all _en rivière_; the same round her waist, and a\r\ncorresponding headdress, and her Spanish and Portuguese orders.\r\nThe emperor said when she appeared: 'Comme tu es belle!'\"\r\n\r\nNext day, as the emperor drove the queen in an open carriage, they\r\ntalked of the Orleans family, whose feelings had been greatly hurt\r\nby a recent sequestration of their property. The emperor tried\r\nto make excuses for this act,--excuses that seemed to the queen\r\nbut tame,--and then he drove to the chapel built over the house\r\nwhere the Duke of Orleans had died on the Avenue de Neuilly. The\r\nemperor bought her two of the medals sold on the spot, one of which\r\nbore the likeness of the Comte de Paris, with an inscription calling\r\nhim the hope of France.\r\n\r\nThe visit ended after eight delightful days, and the emperor escorted\r\nhis guests back to Boulogne.\r\n\r\nPrince Albert, the queen confesses, was not so much carried away\r\nby the fascinations of their new friend as herself; but the empress\r\nsecured his entire commendation.\r\n\r\nThe queen and the emperor continued to correspond, and subsequently\r\nmet several times, at Osborne House or at Cherbourg.\r\n\r\nI have told at some length of this visit, because it seemed to\r\nme to mark the culminating point of Napoleon III.'s successful\r\ncareer; not only was he fully admitted into the inner circle of\r\nEuropean sovereigns, but his place there was confirmed by the personal\r\nfriendship and alliance of the greatest among them.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 there was another Universal Exposition held in Paris; and\r\nthis was also a time of great outward glory and triumph for the\r\nemperor, surrounded as he was by European emperors, crown princes,\r\nand kings; but Queen Victoria was then a sorrowing widow, and decay\r\nwas threatening Napoleon's apparent prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1867 that the emperor and empress received the czar,\r\nthe sultan, the Crown Prince of Prussia, Princess Alice of Hesse\r\nDarmstadt, and many other crowned heads and celebrities. It was\r\na year of fêtes and international courtesies. But in Paris itself\r\nthere was a strange feeling of insecurity,--a fearful looking for\r\nsomething, society knew not what. \"It seemed,\" said one who breathed\r\nthe rarefied air in which lived the upper circles of society, \"as\r\nif the air were charged with electricity; as if the shadows of\r\ncoming events were being darkly cast over the joyous city.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable sights of that gay time of hollowness\r\nand brilliancy was the review given in honor of the Emperor of\r\nRussia, on June 6. No less than sixty thousand French troops, of\r\nall arms of the service, filed past the three grand-stands on the\r\nrace-course of the Bois de Boulogne. On the central stand sat the\r\nEmpress Eugénie, with the Prince Imperial, the Crown Princess of\r\nPrussia, her sister, Princess Alice, and the Grand Duchess of\r\nLeuchtenberg. Before this stand, on horseback on one side, sat the\r\nGrand Duke Vladimir, the Czarevitch (the present Czar of Russia),\r\nthe Crown Prince of Prussia (since the lamented Emperor Frederick),\r\nPrince Gortschakoff (the Russian prime minister), Count Bismarck, and\r\nan English nobleman; on the other side were the Duc de Leuchtenberg,\r\nthe Duke of Mecklenburg, and the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt; while\r\nin the centre of them all rode the czar, with Napoleon III. on\r\none hand, and on the other the king of prussia.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Blackwood's Magazine.]\r\n\r\nHow little could any of those who looked upon that throng of royal\r\npersonages imagine what in little more than two years was coming\r\non them all!\r\n\r\nThe emperor was fond of literature, and when drawn into a literary\r\ndiscussion, his half-closed eyes would gleam with sudden light,\r\nand his criticisms would be both witty and valuable. During his\r\nlater years, harassed by sickness and perplexities of all kinds,\r\nhis greatest pleasure was to shut himself up in his study, and\r\nthere work upon his \"Life of Cæsar.\" He wrote it entirely himself,\r\nthough he had many learned men in France and Germany employed in\r\nlooking up references and making extracts for him. The book was\r\nconsidered a work of genuine merit. To its author it was a labor of\r\nlove. He threw into it all his experience of life, all his theories,\r\nall his Napoleonic convictions; for in Cæsar and Napoleon he found\r\nmany parallels. He hoped to be admitted as a literary man into the\r\nFrench Academy, and he meant to base his claim upon this book.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of the cares that oppressed the emperor in\r\nconnection with the war in the Crimea, which was prolonged far\r\nbeyond his expectations; of the campaign in Italy, broken short\r\noff by threats of intervention made by the king of Prussia, and\r\nfollowed by feelings of disappointment and revenge on the part of\r\nthe Italians; of the intervention of the emperor in 1866, after\r\nthe battle of Sadowa, to check the triumphant march of the Prussian\r\narmy through Austria; nor of the bombs of Orsini, which led to a\r\nrupture of the friendliness between France and England, breaking\r\nup the cordial relations which existed between the two courts in\r\n1857, and reviving that panic about French invasion which seems\r\nperiodically to attack Englishmen ever since the great scare in\r\nthe days of Bonaparte. These subjects belong rather to historical\r\nreminiscences of England, Italy, or Germany; but the emperor had\r\nanxieties besides in France, and often found it hard to regulate\r\nwith discretion even the ways of his own household.\r\n\r\nThe empress, who after she had governed France as regent in 1859,\r\nduring her husband's absence in the Italian war, had been admitted\r\nto councils of state, by no means approved either her husband's\r\ndomestic or foreign policy. We have seen that her influence was\r\nstrongly exerted to bring about the unfortunate attempt to give\r\nan emperor and empress to Mexico; but on two other points that\r\nshe had at heart she failed. She could not persuade her husband\r\nto undertake the reconstruction of the kingdom of Poland, nor to\r\nassist Queen Isabella of Spain when her subjects, exasperated at\r\nlast by her excesses, drove her over the French frontier. The empress\r\ndisliked many of the coterie who enjoyed her husband's intimacy,\r\nespecially his cousin, Prince Napoleon. She resented the prince's\r\nopposition to her marriage; she disliked his manners, his political\r\nopinions, his aggressive opposition to all the offices of religion;\r\nand she succeeded in detaching him from the emperor's confidence,\r\nand in hindering his taking part in public affairs. To his wife--the\r\nPrincess Clotilde--she was deeply attached; but that did not serve to\r\nreconcile her to the prince, her husband. Both ladies were opposed\r\nto any diminution of the pope's temporal power in Italy; but the\r\nprivate circle of the friends of the empress was too gay for the\r\nchastened nature of the Princess Clotilde, and by degrees her intimacy\r\nwith the empress became less close and affectionate than it had\r\nbeen in the early days of her unhappy marriage.\r\n\r\nAn episode in the private life of the palace, in 1859, created\r\nconsiderable friction in Paris, and provoked remonstrances from\r\nthe emperor's ministers.[1] This was the admission to the circle\r\nof intimates who surrounded the empress of the mesmerist and medium\r\nHome. This man gave himself out to be an American; but many persons\r\nsuspected that his native land was Germany, and some said he was a\r\nsecret agent of that court, which had emissaries all over France,\r\nin search of useful information. The empress, having heard of Home's\r\nstrange feats of table-turning and spirit-rapping in fashionable\r\n_salons_ of the capital, was eager to witness his performances. The\r\nwomen in the high society of Paris were greatly excited about them.\r\nSpiritualism was the fad of the season, and the empress caught the\r\ninfection. The emperor, who was present at many of the exhibitions\r\nat the Tuileries, was also, it is said, much impressed by some\r\nof them, especially by a mysterious invisible hand laid firmly\r\non his shoulder, and by an icy breath that passed over his face.\r\nBut although the emperor, always indulgent to his wife, resisted\r\nat first the advice of his counsellors to get rid of Home, he was\r\nforced at last to put an end to the _séances_ at the Tuileries,\r\nFontainebleau, and Biarritz. The spirits \"summoned\" had had the\r\nimprudence to obtrude upon him their own views of his policy. When\r\nthe alliance with Italy and a probable war with Austria were under\r\ndiscussion in the cabinet, the spirit-inspired pencil at the Tuileries\r\nscrawled these words: \"The emperor should declare war and deliver\r\nItaly from the Austrians.\" Not long afterwards, the vulgar presumption\r\nof Home, who had accompanied the court to Biarritz, provoked the\r\nemperor, and caused him to give ear to the earnest remonstrances of\r\nhis Minister for Foreign Affairs. He gave orders that Home should\r\nappear at the Tuileries no more.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pierre de Lana.]\r\n\r\nHome died not long after in Germany, forgotten by the world of\r\nfashion, but leaving behind him a little circle of ardent believers.\r\n\r\nThe story of the emperor's later life seems to me to be one full\r\nof pathos and of pain. It is the record of a man who knew himself\r\nto be slowly dying, whose physical strength was ebbing day by day,\r\nbut who was bearing up under the vain hope of accomplishing the\r\nimpossible. One admires his extreme patience, his uncomplaining\r\nperseverance, as he tried to roll the stone of Sisyphus, yet with\r\nunspoken misgivings in his heart that it would escape from him and\r\ncrush the hopes of his life, as it rolled back out of his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Poor emperor!\" says the eye-witness who beheld him in his hour\r\nof triumph, before the grand-stand, in 1867, at the great review.\r\n\"He was a friend to all, and he fell through his friends. He was\r\nvery true to England, whatever he may have been to other countries;\r\nbut England failed him, unfortunately in Denmark, fortunately in\r\nMexico, and fatally in 1870.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Blackwood's Magazine.]\r\n\r\nIt seems, too, as if the world forgets now--what assuredly must\r\nbe remembered hereafter in history--that it was he who relieved\r\nEurope from the treaties of Vienna, and asserted the claims of\r\nnationalities; that he brought about the resurrection of Italy;\r\nthat through his policy we have a solution satisfactory to the world\r\nin general of the question of the pope's power as a temporal prince\r\nin Italy; that he was the builder of modern Paris, the promoter of\r\nagriculture, the railroad king of France, the peasant's and the\r\nworkman's friend.\r\n\r\nIn early life he had been an adventurer; but a kind heart gave\r\nhim gracious manners. He was grateful, faithful, and generous;\r\nterribly prodigal of money, and the victim of the needy men by whom\r\nhe was surrounded. It seems as if, in spite of his _coup d'état_\r\n(which, subtracting its massacres, may have been a measure of\r\nself-preservation), he deserves better of the world and of France\r\nthan to have his memory spurned and spat upon, as men do now.\r\n\r\nHe gave France eighteen years of pre-eminent prosperity; he left\r\nher, to be sure, in ruins. In his fall he utterly obliterated the\r\nprestige of the name of Bonaparte. No Bonaparte, probably, will ever\r\nagain awaken the enthusiasm of the French people,--an enthusiasm which\r\nNapoleon III. relied on, justly at first, and fatally afterwards,\r\nwhen a generation had arisen in France, from whom the feeling had\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nThe emperor's malady, which was slowly sapping his strength, is said\r\nto be the most painful one that flesh is heir to. Every movement was\r\npain to him. Absolute rest was what he needed, but cares pressed\r\nhard upon him on every side. He must die, and leave his empire in\r\nthe hands of a woman and a child. His government had been wholly\r\npersonal. He could not transmit his power, such is it was, to any\r\nother person,--least of all could he place it in feeble hands.\r\nThere were no props to his throne. No Bismarck or Cavour stood\r\nbeside him, to whom he might confide his wife and son, and feel\r\nthat though his hand no longer held the helm, the ship would sail\r\nstraight on the course he had laid down for her. The men about\r\nhim were third and fourth rate men,--all of them enormously his\r\nown inferiors. They cheated and deceived and plundered him; and he\r\nknew it in a measure, though not as he knew it after his downfall.\r\n\r\nThe emperor said once: \"There is but one Bonapartist among us,\r\nand that is Fleury. The empress is a Legitimist, I am a Socialist,\r\nand Prince Napoleon a Republican.\" As he contemplated the future,\r\nit seems to have occurred to him that the only thing that could be\r\ndone was to teach France to govern herself,--to change his despotic\r\nauthority into a constitutional government. He might live long enough,\r\nhe thought, to make the new plan work, and if, by a successful war\r\nwith Germany, a war impending and perhaps inevitable, he could\r\ngain brilliant military glory; if he could restore to France that\r\nfrontier of the Rhine which had been wrested from her by Europe\r\nafter the downfall of his uncle,--his dynasty would be covered\r\nwith glory, and all might go on right for a few years, till his\r\nboy should be old enough to replace him.\r\n\r\nBoth these expedients he tried. In 1869 he announced that he was\r\nabout to grant France liberal institutions. He put the empress\r\nforward whenever it was possible, and he made up his mind that as\r\nwar with Germany was sure to come, the sooner it came, the better,\r\nthat he might reap its fruits while some measure of life and strength\r\nwas left him. Long before, Prince Albert had assured him that his\r\npolicy, which made his ministers mere heads of bureaux, which never\r\ncalled them together for common action as members of one cabinet,\r\nwhich compelled each to report only to his master, who took on\r\ntrust the accuracy of the reports made to him, was a very dangerous\r\nmode of governing. It was indeed very unlike his uncle's _practice_,\r\nthough it might have been theoretically his _system_. Both uncle\r\nand nephew came into power by a _coup d'état_,--the one on the\r\n18th Brumaire (Nov. 9, 1799), the other on Dec. 2, 1851. Both were\r\nundoubtedly the real choice of the people; both really desired\r\nthe prosperity of France: but the younger man was more genuine,\r\nmore kindly, more human than the elder one. The uncle surrounded\r\nhimself with \"mighty men, men of renown,\"--great marshals, great\r\ndiplomatists, great statesmen. Louis Napoleon had not one man about\r\nhim whom he could trust, either for honesty, ability, or personal\r\ndevotion, unless, indeed, we except Count Walewski. All his life\r\nhe had cherished his early ideas of the liberation of Italy, which\r\nhe accomplished; of the resurrection of Poland, which he never\r\nfound himself in a position to attempt; of the rectification of the\r\nfrontier of France, which he in part accomplished by the attainment\r\nof Nice and Savoy; and, finally, his dream included the restoration\r\nto France of self-government, with order reconciled to liberty.\r\n\r\nAs early as January, 1867, the emperor was consulting, not only his\r\nfriends, but his political opponents as to his scheme of transforming\r\ndespotism into a parliamentary government. He wrote thus to M.\r\nÉmile Ollivier, a leader of the liberal party in France:[1]--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pierre di Lana.]\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, I am not pausing through indecision, nor through a\r\nvain infatuation as to my prerogatives; but my fear is of parting\r\nin this country, which is shaken by so many conflicting passions,\r\nwith the means of re-establishing moral order, which is the essential\r\nbasis of liberty. My embarrassment on the subject of a law of the\r\nPress is not how to find the power of repression, but how to define\r\nin a law what deserves repression. The most dangerous articles\r\nmay escape repression, while the most insignificant may provoke\r\nprosecution. This has always been the difficulty. Nevertheless,\r\nin order to strike the public mind by decisive measures, I should\r\nlike to effect at one stroke what has been called the _crowning\r\nof the edifice_. I should like to do this at once and forever;\r\nfor it is important to me, and it is above all important to the\r\ncountry.... I wish to advance firmly in a straight line, without\r\noscillating to the right or left. You see that I have spoken to\r\nyou with perfect frankness.\"\r\n\r\nWe also see in this letter one of Louis Napoleon's characteristics,--a\r\nfondness for taking people by surprise. Nearly everything he did\r\nwas a surprise to the public, and yet it had long been maturing\r\nin his own mind.\r\n\r\nThe next time M. Ollivier saw the emperor he was told of his intention\r\nto grant the right of holding political meetings; the responsibility\r\nof cabinet ministers to the Chamber; and the almost entire freedom of\r\nthe Press. The emperor added, with a smile: \"I am making considerable\r\nconcessions, and if my government immediately succeeded that of\r\nthe First Empire, this would be acknowledged; but since I came\r\nafter parliamentary governments, my concessions will be considered\r\nsmall.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor's experiment was a failure. The moment restraint was\r\ntaken off, and the French had liberty of speech and freedom of the\r\nPress, they became like boys released from school and its strict\r\ndiscipline. The brutal excesses of language in the Parisian newspapers,\r\nthe fierceness of their attacks upon the Government, and the\r\nshamelessness of their slander, alarmed the emperor and the best\r\nof his personal adherents, who had been by no means supporters of\r\nhis policy. But though the experiment gave signs of never being\r\nlikely to succeed, and no one seemed pleased with the new system,\r\nthe emperor persevered. He refused to withdraw his reforms; he\r\ndeclined to make what children call \"an Indian gift\" to his people:\r\nbut the effect of the divided counsels by which he was embarrassed\r\nwas that these reforms were accepted by the public merely as\r\nexperiments, to be tried during good behavior, and not as the basis\r\nof a new system definitively entered upon.\r\n\r\nAll through the year 1869 the difficulties of the course which the\r\nemperor adopted grew greater and greater. The emancipated Press\r\nwas rampant. It knew no pity and no decency. Its articles on the\r\nemperor's failing health (which he insisted upon reading) were\r\ncruel in the extreme. Terrible anxieties for the future must have\r\nhaunted him. If his project for self-government in France must\r\nprove a failure, when he was dead, what then? Could a child and a\r\nwoman govern as he had done by a despotic will? He had done so in\r\nhis days of health and strength; but events now seemed to intimate\r\nthat his government had been a failure rather than a success.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston, writing from Paris in Charles X.'s time, said:\r\n\"Bonaparte in the last years of his reign crushed every one else,\r\nboth in politics and war. He allowed no one to think and act but\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat the same remark could be applied to the Third Napoleon.\r\nBut Napoleon I. was a great administrator as well as a great general;\r\nhis activity was inexhaustible, he corresponded with everybody, he\r\nlooked after everything, he knew whether he was well or ill served;\r\nand his mode of obtaining power did not hinder his availing himself\r\nof the best talent in France. The case of his nephew was the reverse\r\nof this. His highest quality was his tenacity of purpose, and his\r\ndisposition was inclined to kindly tolerance, even of pecuniary\r\ngreed and slipshod service. He could rouse himself to great exertion;\r\nbut in the later days of Imperialism, pain and his decaying physical\r\npowers had rendered him inert; moreover, in his general habits he had\r\nalways been indolent and pleasure-loving. In carrying out the _coup\r\nd'état_ nine tenths of the public men in France had been subjected\r\nto humiliations and indignities, by which they were permanently\r\noutraged, and a host of co-conspirators and adventurers had acquired\r\nclaims upon the emperor that it was not safe to disregard. Places\r\nand money were distributed among them with reckless profusion, and\r\nmany a shady money transaction, throwing discredit on some men\r\nhigh in favor with the emperor, was passed over, to avoid exposure.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the emperor improved Paris till he made it the\r\nmost beautiful city in the world. It was his aim to open wide streets\r\nthrough the old crowded quarters where revolution hid itself, hatching\r\nplots and crimes. He provided fresh air and drainage. He turned\r\nthe Bois de Boulogne from a mere wild wood into the magnificent\r\npleasure-ground of a great city. He completed the Louvre, and demolished\r\nthe straggling, hideous buildings which disfigured the Carrousel in\r\nLouis Philippe's time. The working population, which his improvements\r\ndrove out of the Faubourg Saint Antoine emigrated to high and healthy\r\nquarters in Montmartre and Belleville, where a beautiful park was\r\nlaid out for them. No part of Paris escaped these improvements,\r\nthough it took immense sums to complete them. But while their good\r\nresults will be permanent, their immediate effect was to raise\r\nrents and make the increased cost of living burdensome to people\r\nof small incomes. The work brought also into Paris an enormous\r\npopulation of masons, carpenters, and day-laborers,--a population\r\nwhich was a good deal like the monster in the fairy tale, which\r\nhad to be fed each day with the best; for if once it became hungry\r\nor dissatisfied, it might devour the man of science who had brought\r\nit into being.\r\n\r\nStill, the French are ungrateful to Napoleon III. when they forget\r\nhow much they are indebted to him for the extension of their commerce,\r\nthe growth of their railroads, the improvement of their cities, and\r\nabove all for his attention to sanitary science and to agriculture.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the throne, every traveller through France was\r\nstruck by the poor breeds of swine, sheep, and cattle; the slovenly\r\nsystem of cultivation, the wide waste lands, the poor implements\r\nfor farming, and the want of drainage. In his exile the emperor\r\nhad lived much with English landowners, and he endeavored more\r\nthan anything else to improve agriculture. He spent great sums\r\nof money himself in model farms for the purpose of showing how\r\nthings could be done. But while commercial, agricultural, and\r\nmanufacturing prosperity increased in France, so also did the cost\r\nof living; and the cry, \"Put money in thy purse!\" found its echo\r\nin the hearts of all men in all classes of society. Speculation\r\nof every kind ran rampant, and by the year 1869 the cost of the\r\nimprovements in Paris alone became greater than France could patiently\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nPersonally, Louis Napoleon had strong sympathy with the working-classes,\r\nand was always seeking to benefit them. He favored co-operative\r\nsocieties; he was planning, when he fell, a system of state annuities\r\nto disabled or to aged workmen. He abolished passports between\r\nFrance and England, and also the French workman's character-book,\r\nor _livret_, which by law he had been compelled to have always\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the emperor's other perplexities, there came, during\r\nthe first days of 1870, a most damaging occurrence connected with\r\nhis own family,--an occurrence with which the emperor had no more\r\nto do than Louis Philippe had had with the Praslin murder; but it\r\nhelped to impair the remaining prestige which clung to the name\r\nof Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nPrince Pierre Bonaparte, grandson of Lucien, was a dissolute and\r\nirregular character. His cousin, the emperor, had repeatedly paid\r\nhis debts and given him, as he did to every one connected with the\r\nname of Bonaparte, large sums of money. At last Prince Pierre's\r\nconduct grew so bad that this help ceased. Then he threatened his\r\ncousin; but the emperor would not even buy an estate he owned in\r\nCorsica. Prince Pierre went back, therefore, to the cradle of his\r\nfamily, and there got into a fierce quarrel with an opposition\r\nmember of the Chamber of Deputies. The deputy, like a true Corsican,\r\nnourished revenge. He waited till he went up to Paris, and there\r\nlaid his grievances against the emperor's cousin before his fellow\r\ndeputies of the opposition. They at once made it a party affair.\r\nOn Jan. 2, 1870,--the day the reformed Chamber of Deputies was\r\nopened,--two journalists of Paris, M. de Tourvielle and M. Victor\r\nNoir, went armed to Pierre Bonaparte's house at Auteuil to carry\r\nhim a challenge. They found the prince in a room where he kept\r\na curious collection of weapons. He was a coarse man, with an\r\nungovernable temper. High words were exchanged. Victor Noir slapped\r\nthe prince in the face, and the prince, seizing a pistol, shot\r\nhim dead. He then turned on M. de Tourvielle; but the latter had\r\ntime to draw a sword from his sword-cane, and stood armed. Victor\r\nNoir's funeral was made the occasion of an immense republican\r\ndemonstration, and M. Rochefort reviled the emperor and all his\r\nfamily in the newspaper he edited, \"La Lanterne,\" calling upon\r\nFrenchmen to make an end of the Bonapartes.\r\n\r\nPrince Pierre was tried for murder, and acquitted; Rochefort was\r\ntried for seditious libel, and condemned. It was an ominous opening\r\nfor the new Chamber. The emperor had been most anxious that it\r\nshould contain no deputies violently opposed to his new policy,\r\nand the elections had been scandalously manipulated in the interest\r\nof his dynasty.\r\n\r\nThiers complained bitterly to an Englishman, who visited him, of\r\nthe undisguised tampering with voters in this election. He said,--\r\n\r\n\"The Government pretends to believe in a Chamber elected by universal\r\nsuffrage, and yet dares not trust the votes of the electors; but\r\nmark my words, this tampering with an election is for the last\r\ntime. What will succeed the Empire, I know not. God grant it may\r\nnot be our country's ruin! But the state of things under which we\r\nlive cannot last long. It is incumbent on honest men to lay before\r\nthe emperor the state of the country, which his ministers do their\r\nbest to keep from him. For a long time I kept silent,--it was no\r\nuse to knock one's head against a wall; but now we have revolution\r\nstaring us in the face, as the alternative with the Empire.\"\r\n\r\nAs the little man said this, we are told that the fire in his eyes\r\ngleamed through his spectacles; and as he walked about the room,\r\nhe seemed to grow taller and taller.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Blackwood's Magazine.]\r\n\r\nThe new constitutional ministry, into whose hands the emperor proposed\r\nto resign despotic power and to rule thenceforward as constitutional\r\nsovereign, had for its chief M. Émile Ollivier; Marshal Le Boeuf\r\n(made marshal on the field of Magenta) was the Minister of War.\r\n\r\nThe debates in the Chamber were all stormy. The opposition might\r\nnot be numerous, but it was fierce and determined. It scoffed at\r\nthe idea of France being free when elections were tampered with\r\nto sustain the Government; and finally things came to such a pass\r\nthat the emperor resolved to play again his tromp-card, and to\r\ncall a _plébiscite_ to say whether the French people approved of\r\nhim and wished to continue his dynasty. They were to vote simply\r\nYes or No.\r\n\r\nThere was not such open tampering this time with the vote as there\r\nhad been in the election of the deputies, but all kinds of Government\r\ninfluences were brought to bear on prefects, _maires_, and other\r\nofficial personages, especially in the villages. The result was\r\nthat 7,250,000 Frenchmen voted Yes, and one and a half million,\r\nNo. But to the emperor's intense surprise and mortification, and in\r\nspite of all precautions, there were 42,000 Noes from the army. It\r\nwas a terrible discovery to the emperor that there was disaffection\r\namong his soldiers. Promotion, many men believed, had for some years\r\nbeen distributed through favoritism. The men had little confidence\r\nin their officers, the officers complained loudly of their men. A\r\ndashing exploit in Algeria made up for irregularities of discipline.\r\nEven the staff officers were deficient in geography, and the stories\r\nthat afterwards came to light of the way in which the War Department\r\ncollected worthless stores, while serviceable ones existed only on\r\npaper, seem almost incredible. Yet when war was declared, Émile\r\nOllivier said that he went into it with a light heart, and Marshal\r\nLe Bœuf was reported to have told the emperor that he would not\r\nfind so much as one button missing on his soldiers' gaiters.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that the army was not to be depended on, and needed\r\na war of glory to put it in good humor with itself and with its\r\nemperor, decided Napoleon III. to enter precipitately into the\r\nFranco-Prussian war while he still had health enough to share in\r\nit. Besides this, a struggle with Germany was inevitable, and he\r\ndared not leave it to his successor. Then, too, if successful,--and\r\nhe never doubted of success,--all opposition at home would be crushed,\r\nand the prestige of his dynasty would be doubled, especially if\r\nhe could, by a brilliant campaign, give France the frontier of\r\nthe Rhine, at least to the borders of Belgium. This would indeed\r\nbe a glorious crowning of his reign.\r\n\r\nHe believed in himself, he believed in his star, he believed in his\r\nown generalship, he believed that his army was ready (though his\r\narmy and navy never had been ready for any previous campaign), and he\r\nbelieved, truly enough, that the prospect of glory, aggrandizement,\r\nand success would be popular in France.\r\n\r\nSpain was at that time in want of a king. Several princes were\r\nproposed, and the most acceptable one would have been the Duc de\r\nMontpensier; but Napoleon III., who dreaded the rivalry of the\r\nOrleans family, gave the Spaniards to understand that he would never\r\nconsent to see a prince of that family upon the Spanish throne. Then\r\nthe Spaniards took the matter into their own hands, and possibly\r\nstimulated by a wish to make a choice disagreeable to the French\r\nemperor, selected a prince of the Prussian royal family, Prince\r\nLeopold of Hohenzollern. The Emperor Napoleon objected at once.\r\nTo have Prussia on the eastern frontier of France, and Prussian\r\ninfluence beyond the Pyrenees, was worse in his eyes than the selection\r\nof Montpensier; and it was certainly a matter for diplomatic\r\nconsideration. M. Benedetti, the French minister at Berlin, was\r\ninstructed to take a very haughty tone with the king of Prussia,\r\nand to say that if he permitted Prince Leopold to accept the Spanish\r\ncrown, it would be a cause of war between France and Prussia. The king\r\nof Prussia replied substantially that he would not be threatened, and\r\nwould leave Prince Leopold to do as he pleased. Prompted, however,\r\nno doubt, by his sovereign, Prince Leopold declined the Spanish\r\nthrone. This was intimated to M. Benedetti, and here the matter\r\nmight have come to an end. But the Emperor Napoleon, anxious for a\r\n_casus belli_, chose to think that the king of Prussia, in making\r\nhis announcement to his ambassador, had not been sufficiently civil.\r\n\r\nA cabinet council was held at the Tuileries. The empress was now\r\nadmitted to cabinet councils, that she might be prepared for a\r\nregency that before long might arrive. She and Marshal Le Bœuf\r\nwere vehement for war. The populace, proud of their fine army,\r\nshouted with one voice, \"A Berlin!\" and on July 15, 1870, war was\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nLet us relieve the sad closing of this chapter, which began so\r\nauspiciously with the emperor and empress in the height of their\r\nprosperity, by telling of an expedition in which the glory of the\r\nempress as a royal lady culminated.\r\n\r\nThe Suez Canal being completed, its opening was to be made an\r\ninternational affair of great importance. The work was the work\r\nof French engineers, led by M. Ferdinand de Lesseps, in every way\r\na most remarkable man.\r\n\r\nEngland looked coldly on the enterprise. To use the vulgar phrase\r\nboth literally and metaphorically, she \"took no stock\" in the Suez\r\nCanal, and she sent no royal personage, nor other representative\r\nto the opening ceremonies; the only Englishman of official rank\r\nwho was present was an admiral, whose flag-ship was in the harbor\r\nof Port Saïd.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Napoleon was wholly unable to leave France at a time\r\nso critical; but he sent his fair young empress in his stead. He\r\nstayed at Saint-Cloud, and took advantage of her absence to submit to\r\na severe surgical operation. The empress went first to Constantinople,\r\nwhere Sultan Abdul Aziz gave a beautiful fête in her honor, at\r\nwhich she appeared, lovely and all glorious, in amber satin and\r\ndiamonds. She afterwards proceeded to Egypt as the guest of the\r\nkhedive, entering Port Saïd Nov. 16, 1869, and returning to Paris\r\non the 5th of December.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _EMPRESS EUGÉNIE._]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the canal across the isthmus of Suez, which was\r\nin a manner to unite the Eastern with the Western world, caused\r\nthe eyes of all Christendom to be fixed on Egypt,--the venerable\r\ngreat-grandmother of civilization. The great work had been completed,\r\nin spite of Lord Palmerston's sincere conviction, which he lost no\r\nopportunity of proclaiming to the world, that it was impossible\r\nto connect the Red Sea with the Mediterranean. The sea-level, he\r\nsaid, was not the same in the two seas so that the embankments\r\ncould not be sustained, and drift-sands from the desert would fill\r\nthe work up rapidly from day to day. Ismaïl Pasha, the khedive\r\nof Egypt, had made the tour of Europe, inviting everybody to the\r\nopening, from kings and kaisers, empresses and queens, down to\r\nmembers of chambers of commerce and marine insurance companies.\r\nGreat numbers were to be present, and the Empress Eugénie was to\r\nbe the Cleopatra of the occasion. But suddenly the khedive was\r\nthreatened with a serious disappointment: the sultan, his suzerain,\r\nwanted to join in the festivities; and if he were present, _he_\r\nmust be the chief personage, the khedive would be thrust into a\r\nvassal's place, and all his glory, all his pleasure in his fête,\r\nwould be gone.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians, whose attention was much absorbed in waterworks\r\nand means of irrigation, had, as far back as the days of Sesostris,\r\nconceived the idea of communication between the Nile and the Red\r\nSea. Traces of the canal that they attempted still remain. Pharaoh\r\nNecho, in the days of the Prophet Jeremiah, revived the project.\r\nDarius and one of the Ptolemies completed the work, but when Egypt\r\nsank back into semi-barbarism, the canal was neglected and forgotten.\r\nIt does not appear, however, that the Pharaohs ever thought of\r\nconnecting the Red Sea with the Mediterranean. The canal of Sesostris\r\nand of Pharaoh Necho was a purely local affair, affecting Egyptian\r\ncommerce alone.\r\n\r\nSome modern Egyptian engineers seem first to have conceived the\r\nproject of a Suez canal; but the man who accomplished it was the\r\nengineer and statesman, M. de Lesseps. In spite of all manner of\r\ndiscouragements, he brought the canal to completion, supported\r\nthroughout by the influence and authority of the khedive. The first\r\nthing to be done was to supply the laborers and the new town of\r\nIsmaïlia with drinking water, by means of a narrow freshwater canal\r\nfrom the Nile. Till then all fresh water had been brought in tanks\r\nfrom Cairo. Next, a town--called Port Saïd, after the khedive who had\r\nfirst favored the plan of the canal--was built on the Mediterranean.\r\nThe canal was to run a straight southerly course to Suez. At Ismaïlia,\r\nthe new city, it would connect with the railroad to Cairo; between\r\nPort Saïd and Ismaïlia it would pass through two swampy lakes.\r\n\r\nIn seven years Port Saïd became a town of ten thousand inhabitants.\r\nThe total length of the canal is about ninety miles, but more than\r\nhalf of it passes through the lakes, which had to be dredged. The\r\nwidth of the canal is a little over one hundred yards, its depth\r\ntwenty-six feet. About sixty millions of dollars were expended on\r\nits construction and the preliminary works that it entailed,--these\r\nlast all tending to the benefit and prosperity of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe grand opening took place Nov. 16, 1869. The sultan was not\r\npresent; he had been persuaded out of his fancy to see the sight,\r\nand the khedive was left in peace as master of ceremonies. The\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph of Austria was there in his yacht, and the\r\nEmpress Eugénie, the \"bright particular star\" of the occasion, was\r\non board the French war-steamer \"L'Aigle.\" As \"L'Aigle\" steamed\r\nslowly into the crowded port, all the bands played,--\r\n\r\n  \"Partant pour la Syrie,\r\n   Le brave et jeune Dunois,\"\r\n\r\nthe air of which had been composed by Queen Hortense, the mother\r\nof the emperor, so that it was dignified during his reign into\r\na national air.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon there was a religious ceremony, which all the crowned\r\nheads and other great personages were expected to attend. Two of\r\nthe sovereigns or heirs-apparent present were Roman Catholics,\r\none was a Protestant, and one a Mohammedan. The Crescent and the\r\nCross for the first time overshadowed worshippers joining in one\r\ncommon prayer. The empress appeared, leaning on the arm of the\r\nEmperor of Austria. She wore a short pale gray silk, with deep\r\nwhite Brussels lace arranged in _paniers_ and flounces. Her hat and\r\nveil were black, and round her throat was a black velvet ribbon.\r\nThe Mohammedan pontiff who officiated on the occasion was understood\r\nto be a man of extraordinary sanctity, brought from a great distance\r\nto lend solemnity to the occasion. He was followed by the chaplain of\r\nthe empress, a stout, handsome Hungarian prelate named M. Bauer.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Blackwood's Magazine.]\r\n\r\nEven up to the morning of November 17, when the passage of the\r\nfleet was to be made through the canal, there were persons at Port\r\nSaïd who doubted if it would get through. The ships-of-war had been\r\ndirected to enter the canal first, and there was to be between\r\neach ship an interval of a quarter of an hour. They were ordered to\r\nsteam at the rate of five miles an hour. \"L'Aigle\" entered first.\r\n\"La Pelouse,\" another French ship, had the greatest draught of\r\nwater; namely, eighteen or nineteen feet.\r\n\r\nThe scenery from the Suez Canal was not interesting. Lakes, then\r\nundrained, stretched upon either side; the banks of the canal being\r\nthe only land visible. But as evening fell, and the sun sank, a\r\nrich purple light, with its warm tones, overspread everything,\r\nuntil the moon rose, touching the waters with her silvery sheen.\r\nBefore this, however, the foremost ships in the procession had\r\nsafely reached Ismaïlia. There the khedive had erected a new palace\r\nin which to review his guests. They numbered about six thousand,\r\nand the behavior of many of them did little credit to civilization.\r\n\r\nThe khedive had arranged an exhibition of Arab horsemanship and\r\nof throwing the _Jereed_; but the sand was so deep that the horses\r\ncould not show themselves to advantage. The empress, wearing a\r\nlarge leghorn hat and yellow veil, rode on a camel; and when an\r\nItalian in the crowd shouted to her roughly, \"Lean back, or you\r\nwill fall off, heels over head,\" the graceful dignity with which she\r\nsmiled, and accepted the advice, won the hearts of all beholders.\r\n\r\nThat night a great ball was given by the khedive in his new palace.\r\n\"It was impossible,\" says an English gentleman, \"to overrate the\r\ngracious influence of the empress's presence. The occasion, great\r\nas it was, would have lost its romance if she had not been there.\r\nShe it was who raised the spirit of chivalry, subdued the spirit\r\nof strife, enmity, and intrigue among rival men, and over commerce,\r\nscience, and avarice spread the gauzy hues of poetry.\"\r\n\r\nAlas! poor empress. Ten months later, she was hurrying as a fugitive\r\non board an English yacht on her way into exile, having passed\r\nthrough anxieties and griefs that had streaked her hair with gray.\r\nEven in the midst of her personal triumphs in the East, there were\r\nclouds on the horizon of her life which she could see darkening\r\nand increasing. A few days before the fêtes of the opening of the\r\ncanal, she writes to her husband, who, though unfit for exertion,\r\nhad gone into Paris on some state occasion,--\r\n\r\n\"I was very anxious about you yesterday, thinking of you in Paris\r\nwithout me; but I see by your telegram that everything passed off\r\nwell. When we observe other nations, we can better perceive the\r\ninjustice of our own. I think, however, in spite of all, that you\r\nmust not be discouraged, but continue in the course you have\r\ninaugurated. It is right to keep faith touching concessions that\r\nhave been granted. I hope that your speech to the Chamber will be\r\nin this spirit. The more strength may be wanted in the future,\r\nthe more important it is to prove to the country that we act upon\r\nideas, and not only on expedients. I speak thus while far away, and\r\nignorant of what has passed since my departure, but I am thoroughly\r\nconvinced that strength lies in the orderly sequence of ideas. I\r\ndo not like surprises, and I am persuaded that a _coup d'état_\r\ncannot be made twice in one reign. I am talking in the dark, and\r\nto one already of my opinion, and who knows more than I can know;\r\nbut I must say something, if only to prove, what you know, that my\r\nheart is with you both, and that if in calm days my spirit loves\r\nto roam in space, it is with you both I love to be in times of\r\ncare or trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPARIS IN 1870: JULY, AUGUST, AND SEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\nAs soon as relations became \"strained\" between France and Germany,\r\naccording to the term used in diplomacy, the king of Prussia ordered\r\nhome all his subjects who had found employment in France, especially\r\nthose in Alsace and Lorraine.[1] Long before this, those provinces\r\nhad been overrun with photographers, pedlers, and travelling workmen,\r\ncommissioned to make themselves fully acquainted with the roads,\r\nthe by-paths, the resources of the villages, and the character\r\nof the rural officials. In the case of France, however, though\r\nall the reports concerning military stores looked well on paper,\r\nthe old guns mounted on the frontier fortresses were worthless,\r\nand the organization of the army was so imperfect that scarcely\r\nmore than two hundred thousand troops could be sent to defend the\r\nFrench frontier from Switzerland to Luxemburg; while Germany, with\r\nan army that could be mobilized in eleven days, was ready by the\r\n1st of August to pour five hundred thousand men across the Rhine.\r\nThe emperor placed great reliance on his _mitrailleuses_,--a new\r\nengine of war that would fire a volley of musketry at once, but\r\nwhich, though horribly murderous, has not proved of great value in\r\nactual warfare. Towards the Rhine were hurried soldiers, recruits,\r\ncannon, horses, artillery, ammunition, wagons full of biscuit and\r\nall manner of munitions of war. The roads between Strasburg and\r\nBelfort were blocked up, and in the disorder nobody seemed to know\r\nwhat should be done. Every one was trying to get orders. The telegraph\r\nlines were reserved for the Government. Quartermasters were roaming\r\nabout in search of their depots, colonels were looking for their\r\nregiments, generals for their brigades or divisions. There were\r\nloud outcries for salt, sugar, coffee, bacon, and bridles. Maps\r\nof Germany as far as the shores of the Baltic were being issued\r\nto soldiers who, alas! were never to pass their own frontier. But\r\nwhile this was the situation near the seat of war, in other parts\r\nof France the scene was different, especially in Brest and other\r\nseaports. These towns were crowded with soldiers and sailors; the\r\nstreets were filled with half-drunken recruits bawling patriotic\r\nsentiments in tipsy songs. And now, for the first time since the\r\nEmpire came into existence, might be heard the unaccustomed strains\r\nof the \"Marseillaise.\" It had been long suppressed in France; but\r\nwhen war became imminent, it was encouraged for the purpose of\r\nexciting military ardor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Erckmann-Chatrian, La Plébiscite.]\r\n\r\nEvery day in the provincial towns the war fever grew fiercer. The\r\nbugle sounded incessantly in the streets of any place where there\r\nwere troops in garrison. Regiment followed regiment on its way\r\ninto Paris, changing quarters or marching to depots to receive\r\nequipments. Orderlies galloped madly about, and heavy ammunition\r\nwagons lumbered noisily over the pavements. Everybody shouted \"A\r\nBerlin,\" and took up the chorus of the \"Marseillaise.\" The post-offices\r\nand telegraph-offices were crowded with soldiers openly dictating\r\ntheir messages to patient officials who put them into shape, and\r\nit was said that nearly every telegram contained the words, \"Please\r\nsend me...\" Alas, poor fellows! it is probable that nothing sent\r\nthem in reply was ever received.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I am indebted for much in this chapter to a private\r\njournal.]\r\n\r\nParisians or residents in Paris all believed at that time in the\r\nprestige of the French army; only here and there a German exile\r\nmuttered in his beard something about Sadowa.\r\n\r\nOn July 27 all Paris assembled on the Boulevards to see the Garde\r\nImpériale take its departure for the frontier. This Imperial Guard\r\nwas a choice corps created by Napoleon III. at the outset of the\r\nCrimean War. It was a force numbering nominally twenty thousand\r\ninfantry and three thousand cavalry. It was a very popular corps,\r\nand the war with Germany was popular; consequently the march from\r\nits barracks to the railroad station was one continued triumph.\r\nAt every halt the Parisians pressed into the ranks with gifts of\r\nmoney, wine, and cigars. \"Vive l'armée!\" shouted the multitude.\r\n\"A Berlin!\" responded the troops; and now and then, as the bands\r\nstruck up the \"Marseillaise,\" the population and the troops burst\r\nout in chorus with the solemn, spirit-stirring words.\r\n\r\nAt the head of this brilliant host rode Marshal Le Bœuf, who was\r\nminister of war and military tutor to the Prince Imperial. After\r\nthe departure of the main body of the corps, large detachments\r\nof cavalry and artillery which belonged to it were expected to\r\nfollow; but they remained behind in the provinces, because Lyons,\r\nMarseilles, and Algeria, all centres of the revolutionary spirit,\r\ncould not, it was found, be left without armed protection. Therefore\r\nonly a portion of the crack corps of the French army went forward to\r\nthe frontier,--a fact never suspected by the public until events,\r\na few weeks later, made it known.\r\n\r\nParis was jubilant. The theatres especially became centres of patriotic\r\ndemonstrations. At the Grand Opera House, Auber's \"Massaniello\"\r\n(called in France the \"Muette de Portici\") was announced. For many\r\nyears its performance had been interdicted under the Second Empire,\r\nthe story being one of heroic revolt. The time had come, however,\r\nwhen its ardent patriotism entitled it to resuscitation. Faure,\r\nthe most remarkable baritone singer of the period, suddenly, at the\r\nbeginning of the second act, which opens with a chorus of fishermen\r\ninciting each other to resist oppression, appeared upon the stage\r\nbearing the French flag. The chorus ranged themselves to right\r\nand left as he strode forward and waved the tricolor above the\r\nfootlights. The house broke into wild uproar, cheer after cheer\r\nrose for the flag, for the singer, for France.\r\n\r\n\"The violence of the applause,\" says one who was present, \"continued\r\nuntil all were breathless; then a sudden silence preceded the great\r\nevent of the evening. In clear, firm tones, Faure launched forth the\r\nfirst notes of the 'Marseillaise;' and as the first verse ended,\r\nhe bounded forward, and unfurling the flag to its full length and\r\nbreadth, he waved it high above his head as he electrified the\r\naudience with the cry, 'Aux armes citoyens!' and subsequently, when\r\nin the last verse he sank upon one knee, and folding the standard\r\nto his heart, raised his eyes towards heaven, he drew all hearts\r\nwith him; tears flowed, hand grasped hand, and deeply solemn was\r\nthe intonation of the volunteer chorus following the call to arms!\r\n\r\n\"The month of July was drawing to a close when the emperor took his\r\ndeparture for Metz, where he was to assume the post of generalissimo.\r\nWith him went gayly the young Prince Imperial, then fourteen years\r\nold. Their starting-point was the small rustic summer-house in\r\nthe park of Saint-Cloud, the termination of a miniature branch\r\nrailroad connecting with the great lines of travel. There the father\r\nand son parted from the empress, who removed the same day to the\r\nTuileries, where she administered the imperial government under\r\nthe title of empress-regent.\r\n\r\n\"It would have been injudicious for the emperor at this time to\r\nrisk a public departure from Paris. The Parisians were so full of\r\nconfidence and enthusiasm that he might have received an inconvenient\r\novation in advance.\"\r\n\r\nSkirmishing had been going on along the frontier between the French\r\nand German outposts since July 21. On August 2 the campaign began\r\nin earnest. After luncheon on that day, the emperor and the Prince\r\nImperial set out by rail from Metz, and returned to Metz to dinner,\r\nhaving invaded German territory and opened the war. They had alighted\r\nat Forbach, and proceeded thence to make a reconnaissance into the\r\nenemy's territory near Saarbrück,--a small town of two thousand\r\ninhabitants, where, strange to say, an International Peace Congress\r\nhad held its session not many months before. This place had an\r\nordinary frontier garrison, and lay two and a half miles beyond the\r\nboundary of France. General Frossard, under the emperor's direction\r\nand supervision, led on his men to attack the place. The first\r\ngun was fired by the Prince Imperial, who here, as his father's\r\ntelegram that night reported to the empress, received his \"baptism\r\nof fire.\" The garrison returned the fire, and then, having lost\r\ntwo officers and seventy-two men, it retired, leaving the French\r\nin possession of the heights above the town. Poor Prince Imperial!\r\nSome harsh lines concerning his first exploit were published in\r\nthe London \"Spectator:\"--\r\n\r\n  \"'How jolly, papa! how funny!\r\n     How the blue men tumble about!\r\n    Huzza! there's a fellow's head off,--\r\n     How the dark red blood spouts out!\r\n    And look, what a jolly bonfire!--\r\n     Wants nothing but colored light!\r\n    Oh, papa, burn a lot of cities,\r\n     And burn the next one at night!'\r\n      \"'Yes, child, it _is_ operatic;\r\n     But don't forget, in your glee,\r\n    That for your sake this play is playing,\r\n     That you may be worthy of me.\r\n    They baptized you in Jordan water,--\r\n     Baptized as a Christian, I mean,--\r\n    But you come of the race of Cæsar,\r\n     And thus have their baptisms been.\r\n    Baptized in true Cæsar fashion,\r\n     Remember, through all your years,\r\n    That the font was a burning city,\r\n     And the water was widows' tears,'\"\r\n\r\nWhen these lines were written, how little could any man have foreseen\r\nthe fate of the poor lad, lying bloody and stark on a hillside of\r\nSouth Africa, deserted by his comrades, and above all by a degenerate\r\ndescendant of Sir Walter Raleigh, who should have risked his life\r\nto defend his charge!\r\n\r\nThe day after the attack on Saarbrück compact masses of Germans were\r\nmoving across the frontier into France, and the next day (August 4),\r\na division of MacMahon's army corps was surprised at Wissembourg,\r\nwhile their commander was at Metz in conference with the emperor.\r\nThe French troops were cut to pieces, and the fugitives spread\r\nthemselves all over the country. The battle had been fought on\r\nground covered with vineyards, and the movements of the French\r\ncavalry had been impeded by the vines. In this battle the French\r\nwere without artillery, but they took eight cannon from the enemy.\r\nThe Prussians, however, being speedily reinforced, recovered their\r\nadvantage and gained a complete victory. Wissembourg, a small town\r\nin Alsace, was bombarded and set on fire. There seemed no officer\r\namong the defeated French to restore order. They had never anticipated\r\nsuch a rout, and were, especially the cavalry, utterly demoralized.\r\n\r\nThe French army was divided into seven army corps, the German into\r\ntwelve. Each German army corps was greatly stronger in men, and\r\nincomparably better officered and equipped, than the French. The\r\nGermans began the war with nearly a million men; the French with\r\nlittle more than two hundred thousand on the frontier, though their\r\narmy was five hundred thousand strong on the official records. The\r\nhabit of the War Office had been to let rich men who were drawn\r\nfor the conscription pay four hundred francs for a substitute,\r\nwhich substitute was seldom purchased, the money going into the\r\npockets of dishonest officials.\r\n\r\nThe two hundred thousand French were stretched in a thin line from\r\nBelgium to the mountains of Dauphiné. A German army corps could break\r\nthis line at almost any point; and throughout the whole campaign\r\nthe French suffered from the lack of reliable information as to\r\nthe movements of the enemy.\r\n\r\nOn August 6, two days after the defeat at Wissembourg, the battle\r\nof Wörth, or Reichshofen, was fought between the German _corps\r\nd'armée_ under the Prussian Crown Prince and the corps of MacMahon,\r\nwhich was completely defeated, and only enabled to leave the field\r\nof battle in retreat rather than rout, by brilliant charges of\r\ncavalry. The French lost six mitrailleuses, thirty guns, and four\r\nthousand unwounded prisoners. On the same day the German reserves\r\nretook Saarbrück, and put to flight General Frossard's division.\r\nAfter these reverses Napoleon III. proposed to retreat on Paris and\r\nto cover the capital. This also was the counsel of MacMahon; but\r\nthe empress-regent opposed it strongly, considering it a movement\r\nthat must prove fatal to the dynasty. She even refused to receive\r\nback her son. And indeed it did not seem unlikely that the good\r\npeople of Paris, who ten days before had cheered clamorously their\r\nbeloved emperor, might have tom him in pieces, had he come back\r\nto them after such a succession of disasters.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August, the very day after the battle of Worth, while\r\nMacMahon was retreating before the victorious army of the Prussian\r\nCrown Prince, the Parisians were made victims of an extraordinary\r\ndeception. A great battle was reported, in which the Crown Prince\r\nhad been made prisoner, together with twenty-six thousand of his\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAll Paris turned into the streets to exult over this victory; everyone\r\nrushed in the direction of the Bourse, where details of the great\r\nvictory were said to have been posted. In every street, from every\r\nhouse, people were summoned to hang out flags and banners. An excited\r\ncrowd filled up the Bourse, many men clinging to the railings, all\r\nshouting, singing, and embracing each other. No one for a long\r\ntime had any clear idea what the rejoicing was about, yet the crowd\r\nwent on shouting and singing choruses, waving hats, and reiterating\r\nthe \"Marseillaise.\" The carriage of Madame Marie Sasse, the prima\r\ndonna, who was on her way to a rehearsal at the Grand Opera House,\r\nwas stopped, and she was requested to sing the \"Marseillaise.\"\r\nShe stood up on the seat of her carriage and complied at once.\r\n\"There was profound silence,\" wrote a gentleman who was in the\r\ncrowd, \"when she gave the first notes of the 'Marseillaise;' but\r\nall Paris seemed to take up the chorus after each stanza. There was\r\nuproarious applause. The last verse was even more moving than when\r\nFaure had sung it, on account of the novelty of the surroundings\r\nand the spontaneous feeling of the people. There were real tears\r\nin the singer's eyes, and her voice trembled with genuine emotion\r\nas she came to the thrilling appeal to _Liberté_.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Capoul also was singing the \"Marseillaise\" in\r\nanother street, and in the Rue Richelieu the mob, having stopped a\r\nbeer cart and borrowed some glasses from a restaurant, were drinking\r\nhealths to the army and the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"All this time,\" says the American, who mingled in the crowd and\r\nshouted with the rest in his excitement, \"it never occurred to me\r\nto doubt the accuracy of the news that had so stirred up Paris;\r\nfor the newspapers on the preceding days had prepared us to expect\r\nsomething of the kind. All at once, upon the Boulevard, I was aware\r\nof a violent altercation going on between a respectable-looking man\r\nand a number of infuriated bystanders. He seemed to be insisting\r\nthat the whole story of the victory was untrue, and that despatches\r\nhad been received announcing heavy disasters. I saw that unlucky\r\ncitizen hustled about, and finally collared and led off by a policeman,\r\nthe people pursuing him with cries of 'Prussian!' But some time\r\nlater in the day some persons in a cab drove down the Boulevards\r\nwith a white banner, inscribed: THE AUTHOR OF THE FALSE NEWS IS\r\nARRESTED! This, however, was not the case, for the news was never\r\ntraced to any person.\"\r\n\r\nThe mob as soon as it began to believe that it had been the victim\r\nof some stockjobbing operators, rushed to the Bourse, determined to\r\npull everything to pieces; but the military were there beforehand,\r\nand it had to content itself with requiring all householders to\r\npull down the flags which two hours before it had insisted must\r\nbe hung out.\r\n\r\nThe Parisians were not easily appeased after this cruel deception,\r\nand took their revenge by spreading damaging reports about the\r\nGovernment of the regency, especially accusing the ministers of\r\nbasely suppressing bulletins from the army, that they might gamble\r\non the stock-exchange. The chief of the cabinet, Émile Ollivier,\r\nwas very nearly mobbed; but he pacified the people by a speech\r\nmade from the balcony of his residence. He was at the time really\r\nunaware that more than one defeat had been sustained.\r\n\r\nHour after hour alarming reports kept coming in; and at last, on\r\nAugust 9, the fatal news of three successive defeats was posted\r\nall over the city. Soon an ominous message, sent by Napoleon III.,\r\nrevealed the full horror of the situation: \"Hasten preparations\r\nfor the defence of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nThe greatest dismay prevailed. The Chambers were summoned to an\r\nevening session. The legislators were guarded by cavalry from the\r\nmob which surged round the Chamber. Ollivier and his cabinet were\r\nforced to resign, and a new cabinet was hastily installed in office,\r\ncalling itself the Ministry of National Defence. Its head was Count\r\nMontauban, a man seventy-five years old, who had gained the title\r\nof Count Palikao by his notorious campaign in China in 1860, when\r\nhe sacked the summer palace at Pekin. M. Thiers had pronounced him\r\nfar more of a soldier than a statesman. He was in command of the\r\nfourth army corps at Lyons when summoned by the empress-regent to\r\ntake up the reins of government; but in the course of the unvaried\r\nsuccession of misfortunes which made up the history of the French\r\narms during the month of August, the public statements of Palikao\r\nproved as unreliable as those of his predecessor. His favorite way\r\nof meeting inquiries was to say oracularly: \"If Paris knew what\r\nI know, the city would be illuminated.\"\r\n\r\nConfidence increased after the empress-regent had proclaimed a\r\n_levée en masse_. There were no arms for those who responded to\r\nthe call, and most of them had to be sent back to their homes; but\r\nit was considered certain that the mere idea of a general call to\r\narms would intimidate the Prussians. Indeed, there was a popular\r\ndelusion, shared even by foreigners, that the Prussian soldiery, on\r\ntheir march to Paris, would be cut to pieces by the peasantry. The\r\nconduct of the peasantry proved exactly the reverse of belligerent.\r\nThe penalties inflicted by the invaders for irregular warfare,\r\nand the profits made by individuals who remained neutral, were\r\ncleverly calculated to render the peasantry, not only harmless,\r\nbut actually useful to the enemy.\r\n\r\nMeantime the French were rapidly evacuating Alsace, and preparing\r\nto make their stand on the Moselle. General Failly's corps of thirty\r\nthousand men, which had failed to come up in time to help MacMahon\r\nat Wörth, were in full retreat, without exchanging a shot with\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Germans continued to march steadily on. The country was\r\nsystematically requisitioned for supplies. The _maire_ or other high\r\nofficial of each village was informed twenty-four hours beforehand\r\nhow many men he was expected to provide with rations; namely, to\r\neach man daily, 1-1/2 lb. bread, 1 lb. Meat, 1/4 lb. coffee, five\r\ncigars, or their equivalent in tobacco, a pint of wine or a quart\r\nof beer, and horse feed. If these demands were not complied with,\r\nhe was assured that the village would be set on fire; and after a\r\nfew examples had been made, the villagers became so intimidated\r\nthat they furnished all that was required of them.\r\n\r\nHere is a description of one night's work done by a Prussian general.\r\nIt is taken from a work by Erckmann-Chatrian;[1] but those graphic\r\nwriters took all their descriptions from the mouths of Alsatian\r\npeasants who had been eye-witnesses of the scenes which they\r\ndescribed:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: La Plébiscite.]\r\n\r\n\"The first thing the Prussian commander did on entering his chamber\r\nin a cottage where he had quarters for the night, was to make three\r\nor four soldiers turn out every article of furniture. Then he spread\r\nout on the floor an enormous map of the country. He took off his\r\nboots and lay down on the map flat on his stomach. Then he called\r\nin six or seven officers, all captains or lieutenants. Each man\r\npulled out a small map. The general called to one of them by name:\r\n'Have you got the road from here to Metting?' 'Yes, General.' 'Name\r\nall the places between here and there.' Then the officer, without\r\nhesitation, told the names of all the villages, farms, streams,\r\nbridges, and woods, the turnings of the roads, the very cow-paths.\r\nThe general followed him on the large map with his finger. 'That's\r\nall right. Take twenty men and go as far as St. Jean by such a\r\nroad. You will reconnoitre. If you want any assistance, send me\r\nword.' And so on, one by one, to all the others.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the system and order of the Germans; while the French,\r\nfull of amazement at their own defeat, unled, unofficered, and\r\ndisorganized, are thus described by Edmond About as he saw them\r\nentering Saverne after the disastrous day at Wörth.\r\n\r\n\"There were cuirassiers,\" he says, \"without cuirasses, fusileers\r\nwithout guns, horsemen on foot, and infantry on horseback. The\r\nroads taken by the army in its flight were blocked by trains of\r\nwagons loaded with provisions and clothing, and the woods were\r\nfilled with stragglers wandering about in a purposeless way. Among\r\nthe spoils of that day which fell into the hands of the Prussians\r\nwere several railroad freight-cars loaded with Paris confectionery:\r\nand two days after the battle it was easier to obtain a hundredweight\r\nof bonbons at Forbach than a loaf of bread.\"\r\n\r\nAll this happened in one week, from August 2 to August 6. During\r\nthis week the emperor stayed at Metz, having been implored by his\r\ngenerals to keep away from the army.\r\n\r\nA week later, Strasburg was besieged. MacMahon, the remnants of\r\nwhose corps had been driven out of Alsace by the Crown Prince, was\r\nendeavoring to effect a juncture with the army corps of De Failly.\r\n\r\nThe object of the emperor and Marshal MacMahon was to concentrate\r\nas large a force as possible before the very strongly fortified\r\ncity of Metz. But as soon as they reached Metz the armies of General\r\nSteinmetz and Prince Frederic Charles, two hundred and fifty thousand\r\nstrong, began to close in upon them. There seemed no safety but\r\nin further retreat. The emperor wanted to give up Lorraine, and\r\nto concentrate all his forces in an intrenched camp at Châlons;\r\nbut advices from Paris warned him that a revolt would break out\r\nin the capital if he did so. He therefore resigned his position\r\nas commander-in-chief to Marshal Bazaine. He was coldly received\r\nin the camp at Châlons, and his presence with several thousand\r\nmen as a body-guard was an impediment to military operations. He\r\nwas therefore virtually dropped out of the army, and from August\r\n18, when this news was known in Paris, his authority in France\r\nwas practically at an end. On the same day (August 18) Bazaine's\r\narmy was driven into Metz after the battle of Gravelotte, at which\r\nbattle the French, though defeated, distinguished themselves by\r\ntheir bravery. Bazaine had one hundred and seventy thousand men\r\nwith him when he retired behind the walls of Metz. Here he was\r\nclosely besieged till October 27, when he surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe news that reached Paris of these events (just one month after\r\nthe emperor had signed the declaration of war) not only resulted in\r\nhis practical deposition, but caused a notoriously anti-Bonapartist\r\ngeneral to be appointed military governor of the capital. Imperialism\r\nremained an empty name. France was without one ally, nor had the\r\nemperor one friend. Meantime Palikao, to appease the irritation\r\nof the public, continued to announce victory after victory. Of\r\nall his fantastic inventions, the most fantastic was one published\r\nimmediately after Bazaine had shut himself up with his army in Metz.\r\nA despatch was published, and universally accepted with confidence\r\nand enthusiasm, announcing that three German army corps had been\r\noverthrown at the Quarries of Jaumont. There are no quarries at\r\nJaumont, there were no Prussians anywhere near the spot, and none\r\nhad been defeated; but the Parisians were well satisfied.\r\n\r\nAfter the first panic caused by the despatch that Paris must prepare\r\nfor defence, means were taken for provisioning the city. Clément\r\nDuvernois, an ex-radical, an ex-Bonapartist, and one of the members\r\nof the Ministry of Defence, gave ignorant and reckless orders for\r\nsupplies, which, in spite of the gravity of the situation, amused\r\nthe Parisians immensely.\r\n\r\nDroves of cattle passed all day along the Boulevards, going to\r\nbe pastured in the Bois de Boulogne, where they were tended by\r\nGardes Mobiles from the rural districts. The cattle, the camps,\r\nand the fortifications attracted crowds of curious spectators.\r\n\r\nThe tap of the drum was wellnigh incessant in the city; and while\r\nthe enemy was drawing near, and bloody defeats followed each other\r\nin rapid succession, the Parisians seemed chiefly stimulated to\r\nwrite fresh libels in the newspapers, and to amuse each other with\r\ncaricatures and satires.\r\n\r\nAmong other foolish measures was that of ordering all firemen from\r\nthe departments up to Paris. They remained in the city a week,\r\nand were then sent home. In their absurd and heavy uniforms, and\r\nwith nothing whatever to do, the poor country fellows presented\r\na miserable appearance as they sat in rows along the curbstones\r\nof the avenues, with their helmets glittering in the August sun,\r\n\"looking,\" as some one remarked, \"like so many rare beetles on\r\nexhibition,\" the spectacle being all the more ludicrous from the\r\nextreme dejection of the innocent heroes.\r\n\r\nTroops were always on the move. The Gardes Mobiles, formed into\r\ncompanies, were not wanted anywhere. Being too raw as yet for active\r\nservice, they were transferred from one barrack to another, and\r\nwere drilled in the open streets and in the public squares. The\r\nforts absorbed a number of them; others were employed as shepherds\r\nand drovers. The surplus was billeted on the citizens.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of August there began to be a notion that the city\r\nwas full of spies, and all suspected persons were called Prussians.\r\nThe mania for spy-hunting became general, and was frequently very\r\ninconvenient to Americans and Englishmen. Germans in Paris, many of\r\nwhom had intermarried with the French, naturally found themselves\r\nin a most unhappy situation. At first they were strictly forbidden\r\nto leave Paris; then suddenly they were ordered away, on three\r\ndays' notice, under penalty of being treated as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nThis decree affected eighty thousand persons in France, nearly all\r\nof whom were connected by family ties or business relations with\r\nthe country of their adoption. The outcry raised by the English and\r\nGerman Press about this summary expulsion procured some modification\r\nof the order,--not, however, without a protest from the radicals,\r\nwho clamored for the rigor of the law. Mr. Washburne, the American\r\nminister, the only foreign ambassador who remained in Paris during\r\nthe siege, had accepted the charge of these unhappy Germans, and\r\nheart-breaking scenes took place daily at the American Legation.\r\n\r\nSoon after the defeats in the first week in August, Mr. Washburne\r\nhad his last interview with the Empress Eugénie.\r\n\r\n\"She had evidently,\" he says, \"passed a sleepless and agitated\r\nnight, and was in great distress of mind. She at once began to\r\nspeak of the terrible news she had received, and the effect it\r\nwould have on the French people. I suggested to her that the news\r\nmight not be quite so bad as was reported (alas! it was far worse),\r\nand that the consequences might in the end be far better than present\r\ncircumstances indicated. I spoke to her about the first battle of\r\nBull Run, and the defeat that the Union army had there suffered,\r\nwhich had only stimulated the country to greater exertions. She\r\nreplied: 'I only wish the French in these respects were like you\r\nAmericans; but I am afraid they will get too much discouraged,\r\nand give up too soon.'\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Recollections of a Minister to France.]\r\n\r\nAll this time the \"Figaro\" was publishing articles that held out\r\nhopes of victory and flattered the self-confidence of the Parisians.\r\nMarshals MacMahon and Bazaine were represented as leading the enemy\r\ncraftily into a snare, and the illusion was kept up that the Germans\r\nwould be cut to pieces by the peasantry \"before they could lay\r\ntheir sacrilegious hands,\" said Victor Hugo, \"upon the Mecca of\r\ncivilization.\" Instead of this, the Crown Prince's army was marching\r\nin pursuit of MacMahon's forces through the great plains of Champagne.\r\nMacMahon had some design of turning back, uniting with another\r\narmy corps, and attacking the Prussians in the rear, thus hemming\r\nin part of their army between himself and the troops of Bazaine\r\nin Metz; but he seems to have been really in the position of a\r\npawn driven about a chess-board by an experienced player.\r\n\r\nContinually retreating, the emperor, who was with MacMahon's army,\r\nat last found himself at Sedan, safe, as he hoped, for a brief\r\nbreathing space, from the attacks of the two Prussian army corps\r\nwhich were following in his rear. He had been warned repeatedly\r\nthat he must not return to Paris without a victory. \"The language\r\nof reason,\" he remarked, \"is no longer understood at the capital.\"\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 30, 1870, the retreating French were concentrated, or rather\r\nmassed, under the walls of Sedan,[1] in a valley commonly called\r\nthe Sink of Givonne. The army consisted of twenty-nine brigades,\r\nfifteen divisions, and four _corps d'armée_, numbering ninety thousand\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Victor Hugo, Choses vues.]\r\n\r\n\"It was there,\" says Victor Hugo, \"no one could guess what for,\r\nwithout order, without discipline, a mere crowd of men, waiting,\r\nas it seemed, to be seized by an immensely powerful hand. It seemed\r\nto be under no particular anxiety. The men who composed it knew,\r\nor thought they knew, that the enemy was far away. Calculating\r\nfour leagues as a day's march, they believed the Germans to be at\r\nthree days distance. The commanders, however, towards nightfall,\r\nmade some preparations for safety. The whole army formed a sort\r\nof horse-shoe, its point turning towards Sedan. This disposition\r\nproved that its chiefs believed themselves in safety. The valley\r\nwas one of those which the Emperor Napoleon used to call a 'bowl,'\r\nand which Admiral Van Tromp designated by a less polite name. No\r\nplace could have been better calculated to shut in an army. Its very\r\nnumbers were against it. Once in, if the way out were blocked, it\r\ncould never leave it again. Some of the generals,--General Wimpfen\r\namong them--saw this, and were uneasy; but the little court around\r\nthe emperor was confident of safety. 'At worst,' they said, 'we\r\ncan always reach the Belgian frontier.' The commonest military\r\nprecautions were neglected. The army slept soundly on the night\r\nof August 31. At the worst they believed themselves to have a line\r\nof retreat open to Mézières, a town on the frontier of Belgium.\r\nNo cavalry reconnoissance was made that night; the guards were\r\nnot doubled. The French believed themselves more than forty miles\r\nfrom the German army. They behaved as if they thought that army\r\nunconcentrated and ill-informed, attempting vaguely several things\r\nat once, and incapable of converging on one point, namely, Sedan.\r\nThey thought they knew that the column under the Prince of Saxony\r\nwas marching upon Châlons, and that the Crown Prince of Prussia\r\nwas marching upon Metz.\r\n\r\n\"But that night, while the French army, in fancied security, was\r\nsleeping at Sedan, this is what was passing among the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"By a quarter to two A. M. the army of the Prince of Saxony was\r\non its march eastward, with orders not to fire a shot till five\r\no'clock, and to make as little noise as possible. They marched\r\nwithout baggage of any kind. At the same hour another division of\r\nthe Prussian army marched, with equal noiselessness, from another\r\ndirection, on Sedan, while the Würtemburgers secured the road to\r\nMézières, thereby cutting off the possibility of a retreat into\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\n\"At the same moment, namely, five o'clock,--on all the hills around\r\nSedan, at all points of the compass, appeared a dense, dark mass\r\nof German troops, with their commanders and artillery. Not one\r\nsound had been heard by the French army, not even an order. Two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand men were in a circle on the heights round\r\nthe Sink of Givonne. They had come as stealthily and as silently as\r\nserpents. They were there when the sun rose, and the French army\r\nwere prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nThe battle was one of artillery. The German guns commanded every\r\npart of the crowded valley. Indeed, the fight was simply a massacre.\r\nThere was no hope for the French, though they fought bravely. Their\r\nbest troops, the Garde Impériale, were with Bazaine at Metz. Marshal\r\nMacMahon was wounded very early in the day. The command passed\r\nfirst to General Ducrot, who was also disabled, and afterwards to\r\nWimpfen, a brave African general who had hurried from Algeria just\r\nin time to take part in this disastrous day. He told the emperor\r\nthat the only hope was for the troops to cut their way out of the\r\nvalley; but the army was too closely crowded, too disorganized,\r\nto make this practicable. One Zouave regiment accomplished this\r\nfeat, and reached Belgium.\r\n\r\nThat night--the night of September 1--an aide-de-camp of the Emperor\r\nNapoleon carried this note to the camp of the king of Prussia:--\r\n\r\nMONSIEUR MON FRÈRE,--Not having been able to die in midst of my\r\ntroops, it only remains for me to place my sword in the hands of\r\nyour Majesty.\r\n\r\n  I am your Majesty's good brother,\r\n\r\n    NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\nThe king of Prussia replied,--\r\n\r\nMONSIEUR MON FRÈRE,--Regretting the circumstances under which we\r\nmeet, I accept the sword of your Majesty, and I invite you to designate\r\none of your officers, provided with full powers, to treat for the\r\ncapitulation of the army which has so bravely fought under your\r\ncommand. On my side I have named General von Moltke for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  I am your Majesty's good brother,\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nBefore Sedan, Sept. 1, 1870.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning early, a carriage containing four French officers\r\ndrove out from Sedan, and came into the German lines. The carriage\r\nhad an escort of only three horsemen. When it had reached the Germans,\r\none of its occupants put out his head and asked, in German, for\r\nCount von Bismarck? The Germans replied that he was at Donchéry.\r\nThither the carriage dashed away. It contained the French emperor.\"\r\n\r\nWith Napoleon III. fell not only his own reputation as a ruler,\r\nbut the glory of his uncle and the prestige of his name.\r\n\r\nThe fallen emperor and Bismarck met in a little house upon the\r\nbanks of the Meuse. Chairs were brought out, and they talked in\r\nthe open air. It was a glorious autumn morning. The emperor looked\r\ncare-worn, as well he might. He wished to see the king of Prussia\r\nbefore the articles of capitulation were drawn up: but King William\r\ndeclined the interview. When the capitulation was signed, however,\r\nhe drove over to visit the captive emperor at a château where the\r\nlatter had taken refuge.\r\n\r\nTheir interview was private; only the two sovereigns were present.\r\nThe French emperor afterwards expressed to the Crown Prince of Prussia\r\nhis deep sense of the courtesy shown him. He was desirous of passing\r\nas unnoticed as possible through French territory, where, indeed,\r\nexasperation against him, as the first cause of the misfortunes of\r\nFrance, was so great that his life would have been in peril. The\r\nnext day he proceeded to the beautiful palace at Cassel called\r\nWilhelmshöhe, or William's Rest. It had been built at ruinous expense\r\nby Jérôme Bonaparte while king of Westphalia, and was then called\r\nNapoleon's Rest.\r\n\r\nEvery consideration that the German royal family could show their\r\nformer friend and gracious host was shown to Louis Napoleon. This\r\ntold against him with the French. Was the man who had led them into\r\nsuch misfortunes to be honored and comforted while they were suffering\r\nthe consequences of his selfishness, recklessness, negligence, and\r\nincapacity?\r\n\r\nThus eighty thousand men capitulated at Sedan, and were marched\r\nas prisoners into Germany; one hundred and seventy-five thousand\r\nFrench soldiers remained shut up in Metz, besides a few thousands\r\nmore in Strasburg, Phalsbourg, Toul, and Belfort. But the road\r\nwas open to Paris, and thither the various German armies marched,\r\nleaving the Landwehr, which could not be ordered to serve beyond the\r\nlimits of Germany, to hold Alsace and Lorraine, already considered\r\na part of the Fatherland. The Prussians did not reach Paris till\r\nSeptember 19, two weeks after the surrender at Sedan,--which seemed\r\nrather a lull in the military operations of a war in which so much\r\nhad occurred during one short month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF PARIS.\r\n\r\nThough the surrender of the emperor and his army at Sedan took place\r\non September 2, nothing whatever was known of it by the Parisian\r\npublic until the evening of September 4, when a reporter arrived\r\nat the office of the \"Gaulois\" with a Belgian newspaper in his\r\npocket. The \"Gaulois\" dared not be the first sheet to publish the\r\nnews of such a disaster; but despatches had already reached the\r\nGovernment, and by degrees rumors of what had happened crept through\r\nthe streets of the capital. No one knew any details of the calamity,\r\nbut every one soon understood that something terrible had occurred.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly held a midnight session; but nothing was\r\ndetermined on until the morning, when the Empire was voted out,\r\nand a Republic voted in.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful Sunday morning. Every Parisian was in the street,\r\nand, wonderful to say, all faces seemed to express satisfaction. The\r\nloss of an army, the surrender of the emperor, the national disgrace,\r\nthe prospect of a siege, the advance of the Prussians,--were things\r\napparently forgotten. Paris was charmed to have got rid of so unlucky\r\na ruler,--the emperor for whom more than seven millions of Frenchmen\r\nhad passed a vote of confidence a few months before. He seemed to\r\nhave no longer a single friend, or rather he had _one:_ in the\r\nAssembly an elderly deputy stood up in his place and boldly said that\r\nhe had taken an oath to be faithful to the Emperor Napoleon, and\r\ndid not think himself absolved from it by his misfortunes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _JULES SIMON._]\r\n\r\nIt was almost in a moment, almost without a breath of opposition,\r\nthat on the morning of Sept. 5, 1870, the Empire was voted at an\r\nend, and a Republic put in its place. The duty of governing was\r\nat once confided to seven men, called the Committee of Defence. Of\r\nthese, Arago, Crémieux, and Gamier-Pagès had been members of the\r\nProvisional Government in 1848, while Léon Gambetta, Jules Favre,\r\nJules Ferry, and Jules Simon afterwards distinguished themselves.\r\nRochefort, the insurrectionist, made but one step from prison to\r\nthe council board, and was admitted among the new rulers. But the\r\ntwo chief men in the Committee of Defence were Jules Favre and\r\nGambetta.\r\n\r\nGambetta, who before that time had been little known, was from\r\nthe South of France, and of Italian origin. He was a man full of\r\nenthusiasm, vehement, irascible, and impulsive. The day came when\r\nthese qualities, tempered and refined, did good service to France,\r\nwhen he also proved himself one of those great men in history who\r\nare capable of supreme self-sacrifice. At present he was untried.\r\n\r\nJules Favre was respected for his unstained reputation and perfect\r\nintegrity, his disinterestedness and civic virtues, as also for\r\nhis fluency of speech. In person he was a small, thin man, with\r\na head that was said to resemble the popular portraits of General\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jules Trochu, who was confirmed as military commander of\r\nParis, had written a book, previous to the war, regarding the\r\ninefficiency of the French army; he had been therefore no favorite\r\nwith the emperor. His chief defect, it was said, was that he talked\r\nso well that he was fond of talking, and too readily admitted many\r\nto his confidence.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Regency had in the night melted away. A mob was\r\nsurging round the Tuileries. Where had the empress-regent fled?\r\n\r\nWhen disasters had followed fast upon one another, the empress\r\nhad in her bewilderment found it hard to realize that the end of\r\nthe empire was at hand. Bazaine was the man whom she relied on.\r\nShe had no great liking for Marshal MacMahon, and she does not\r\nappear to have been conscious that all was lost till, on the night\r\nof September 4, she found M. Conti, the emperor's secretary, busy\r\ndestroying his private papers. To burn them was impossible; they\r\nwere torn into small bits and put in a bath-tub, then hot water\r\nwas poured over them, which reduced them to pulp. Vast quantities,\r\nhowever, remained undestroyed, some of them compromising to their\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nWhen the truth of the situation broke upon the empress, she was\r\nvery much frightened. Her dread was that she might be torn in pieces\r\nby a mob that would invade the Tuileries. In a fortnight her fair\r\nface had become haggard, and white streaks showed themselves in\r\nher beautiful hair.\r\n\r\nIt is safest in such cases to trust foreigners rather than subjects.\r\nTwo foreigners occupied themselves with plans for the empress's\r\npersonal safety. The first idea was that if flight became inevitable,\r\nshe should take refuge with the Sisters of the Sacré Cœur, in their\r\nconvent in the Rue Picpus; and arrangements had been made for this\r\ncontingency.\r\n\r\nThe life of the empress was strange and piteous during her last\r\ndays upon the throne. She was up every morning by seven, and heard\r\nmass. Her dress was black cashmere, with a white linen collar and\r\ncuffs. All day she was the victim of every person who claimed an\r\naudience, all talking, protesting, gesticulating, and generally\r\nbegging. The day the false rumor arrived that the Prussians had\r\nbeen defeated at the Quarries of Jaumont she flew down to the\r\nguard-room, where the soldiers off duty were lounging on their beds,\r\nwaving the telegram over her head.\r\n\r\nThe news of the capitulation at Sedan and of the decree deposing the\r\nemperor, roused the Parisian populace. By one o'clock on September 5\r\nthe mob began to threaten the Tuileries. Then the Italian ambassador,\r\nSignor Nigra, and the Austrian ambassador, Prince Richard Metternich,\r\ninsisted that the empress must seek a place of safety. As it was\r\nimpossible to reach the street from the Tuileries, they made their\r\nway through the long galleries of the Louvre, and gained the entrance\r\nopposite the parish church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois.[1] The\r\nstreet was blocked with people uttering cries against the emperor.\r\nA _gamin_ recognized the fugitives, and shouted, \"Here comes the\r\nempress!\" De Nigra gave him a kick, and asked him how he dared to\r\ncry: \"Vive l'Empereur?\" At this the crowd turned upon the boy,\r\nand in the confusion the empress and her lady-in-waiting were put\r\ninto a cab, driven, it is said, by Gamble, the emperor's faithful\r\nEnglish coachman. If this were so, the empress did not recognize\r\nhim, for after proceeding a little way, she and Madame le Breton,\r\nher companion, finding they had but three francs between them, and\r\ndreading an altercation with the cabman if this were not enough\r\nto pay their fare, got out, and proceeded on foot to the house of\r\nthe American dentist, Dr. Thomas Evans. There they had to wait\r\ntill admitted to his operating-room. The doctor's amazement when\r\nhe saw them was great; he had not been aware of what was passing\r\nat the Tuileries, but he took his hat, and went out to collect\r\ninformation. Soon he returned to tell the empress that she had not\r\nescaped a moment too soon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Temple Bar, 1883.]\r\n\r\nHis wife was at Deauville, a fashionable watering-place in Normandy.\r\nThe doctor placed her wardrobe at the disposal of the empress,\r\nwho had saved nothing of her own but a few jewels. It is said she\r\nowned three hundred dresses, and her collection of fans, laces,\r\netc., was probably unique. Her own servants had begun to pillage\r\nher wardrobe before she left the Tuileries. It is said that she\r\nwould have gone forth on horseback and have put herself at the head\r\nof the troops, but that no riding-habit had been left her, except\r\na gay green-and-gold hunting dress worn by her at Fontainebleau.\r\nThat morning no servant in the Tuileries could be found to bring\r\nher breakfast to her chamber.\r\n\r\nThe next day Dr. Evans, in his own carriage, took her safely out\r\nof Paris, in the character of a lady of unsound mind whom he and\r\nMadame le Breton were conveying to friends in the country. Two\r\ndays later they reached Deauville after several narrow escapes,\r\nthe empress, on one occasion, having nearly betrayed herself by\r\nan effort to stop a man who was cruelly beating his horse.\r\n\r\nThere were two English yachts lying at Deauville. On board of one\r\nof these Dr. Evans went. It belonged to Sir John Burgoyne, grandson\r\nof the General Burgoyne who surrendered at Saratoga. Sir John,\r\nwith his wife, was on a pleasure cruise. His yacht, the \"Gazelle,\"\r\nwas very small, only forty-five tons' burden, and carried a crew\r\nof six men.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Sir John Burgoyne had satisfied himself that it was\r\nreally the empress who was thus thrown on his protection, he placed\r\nhimself and his yacht at her disposal, insisting, however, that she\r\nmust not come on board till nearly midnight, when he would meet\r\nher on the _quai_. It was fortunate that he made this arrangement,\r\nfor, after dark, a police agent and a Russian spy came on board\r\nand searched every corner of the little vessel. When at last they\r\ndeparted, Sir John went on to the _quai_, and shortly afterwards\r\nmet two ladies, and a gentleman who carried a hand-bag. One of the\r\nladies stepped up to him and said, \"I believe you are the English\r\ngentleman who will take me to England. I am the empress.\" She then\r\nburst into tears. On reaching the yacht, her first eager demand\r\nwas for newspapers. Happily Lady Burgoyne could tell her that the\r\nPrince Imperial was safe in England; from the English papers she also\r\nlearned particulars of the disaster at Sedan, of the proclamation of\r\nthe Republic in the Corps Législatif at Paris, and of the treatment\r\nof the emperor.\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious time for all on board the \"Gazelle,\" for the\r\ntide would not serve to leave the harbor till seven o'clock the\r\nnext morning, and Deauville was wildly riotous all night. At last\r\nthey worked out of the harbor and were at sea; but a tempest was\r\nraging in the Channel, and so violent was it that at half-past one\r\nthe next morning the great English ironclad \"Captain,\" commanded\r\nby Sir Hugh Burgoyne, Sir John's cousin, went down, with all on\r\nboard, not far from where the little \"Gazelle\" was battling with\r\nthe gale. The \"Gazelle\" had a terrible passage, shipping tremendous\r\nseas. She danced and rolled like a cork; but the ladies were brave,\r\nand were encouraged by Lady Burgoyne's composure. \"There was no\r\naffectation of courage in Lady Burgoyne,\" said the empress afterwards;\r\n\"she simply acted as if nothing were the matter.\"\r\n\r\nAfter about eighteen hours of this stormy passage the \"Gazelle\"\r\nwas safe at anchor off Ryde, in the Isle of Wight. The empress was\r\nanxious that no one should know she was in England; but Sir John\r\ntold her it was his duty to inform the Foreign Office immediately.\r\nAn answer was at once returned by Lord Granville, assuring the\r\nempress of welcome and protection; but he added in a postscript\r\nto Sir John: \"Don't you think you may have been imposed upon?\"\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the Foreign Office had already received news\r\nof the escape of the empress by way of Ostend, under the charge\r\nof two English gentlemen, who had been themselves deceived. The\r\nladies they had assisted to leave Paris were Princess Clotilde\r\nand an attendant.\r\n\r\nAfter the emperor's release from Wilhelmshöhe he received Sir John\r\nBurgoyne at Chiselhurst, and thanked him, with tears in his eyes,\r\nfor his care of the empress, adding that no sailors but the English\r\ncould have got across the Channel on such a night in so small a\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\nAfter peace had been signed between Prussia and France, the emperor\r\nlanded at Dover, where he was touched by the kindly and respectful\r\nreception he met with from the English people. The next day he\r\nwas visited by Lord Malmesbury, an old friend in the days of his\r\nyouth, before he entered on his life of adventure. Lord Malmesbury\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"He came into the room alone to meet me, with that remarkable smile\r\nthat could light up his dark countenance. I confess I never was more\r\nmoved. His quiet and calm dignity, and absence of all nervousness\r\nor irritability, were grand examples of moral courage. All the\r\npast rushed to my memory. He must have seen what I felt, for he\r\nsaid: '_À la guerre comme à la guerre_. It is very good of you\r\nto come to see me.' In a quiet, natural way he then praised the\r\nkindness of the Germans at Wilhelmshöhe, nor did a single plaint\r\nescape him during our conversation. He said he had been deceived as\r\nto the force and preparation of his armies, but without mentioning\r\nnames, nor did he abuse anybody, till I mentioned Trochu, who had\r\nabandoned the empress, whom he had sworn to defend. During half an\r\nhour he conversed with me as in the best days of his life, with\r\ndignity and resignation, but when I saw him again he was much more\r\ndepressed. He was grieving at the destruction of Paris, and at the\r\nanarchy prevailing over France, far more than he had done over\r\nhis own misfortunes. That the Communists should have committed such\r\nhorrors in the presence of their enemies, the Prussians, seemed\r\nto him the very acme of humiliation and national infamy.\"\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 9, 1873, he died at Chiselhurst, in the presence of the\r\nempress, who never left him, released from the storms of a fitful\r\nexistence and from intense physical suffering.\r\n\r\nLet us return now to Paris and the Committee of Defence, its new\r\nRepublican Government. Though the people of Paris, in the excitement\r\nconsequent on the proclamation of a Republic, seemed to have forgotten\r\nthe Prussians, the prospect of their speedy arrival stared the\r\nGovernment in the face. It was a Government, not of France, but\r\nof Paris. France had had no voice in making this new Republic, nor\r\nwas it at all likely that it would be popular in the Provinces;\r\nbut meanwhile work of every kind was pressing on its hands. The\r\nfortifications of Paris were unmanned, and, indeed, were not even\r\ncompleted, and there were hardly any soldiers in the capital.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done was to bring provisions into the city.\r\nCattle, grain, salt, hay, preserved meats, in short, everything\r\nedible that could be imagined, poured in so long as the railroads\r\nremained open. All public buildings became storehouses, but affairs\r\nwere conducted with such recklessness and disorder that the live-stock\r\nsuffered terribly, and half the hay was wasted. As to troops, General\r\nVinoy arrived with twenty thousand soldiers, who had been stationed\r\nbetween Belgium and Sedan. They had never fought the Pussians, but\r\nwere impatient of discipline and utterly demoralized. Stragglers\r\nand fugitives from Sedan came in also, but these were still less\r\nto be depended on. The National Guard had never enjoyed the favor\r\nof the emperor, and had been suffered to fall to pieces. It was now\r\nreorganized and armed as well as the Government was able. There was\r\na body of Mobiles who had been sent away from the army by Marshal\r\nMacMahon because they were so insubordinate that he did not know\r\nwhat to do with them. Ninety thousand Mobiles came up from the\r\nProvinces before the gates of Paris closed,--excellent material for\r\nsoldiers but wholly uninstructed,--and finally about ten thousand\r\nsailors arrived from Brest, who were kept in strict line by their\r\nofficers, and were the most reliable part garrison.\r\n\r\nThe male population of Paris remained in the city, almost to a\r\nman, except those known to the police as thieves or ex-convicts,\r\nwho were all sent away. Women and children also were removed, if\r\ntheir husbands and fathers could afford places of safety.\r\n\r\nAround the city was a wall twelve yards high, forming a polygonal\r\ninclosure. At each corner of the polygon was a bastion, in which\r\nwere stationed the big guns. The wall connecting the bastions is\r\ncalled a curtain. The bastions protected the curtains, and were\r\nthemselves protected by sixteen detached forts, built on all the\r\neminences around Paris. The most celebrated of these forts lies to\r\nthe west of Paris, between it and Versailles, and is called Fort\r\nValérien It is erected on a steep hill long called Mont Calvaire,\r\nfrom which is a magnificent view of the city. This and stony hill\r\nfor several centuries used to be ascended by pilgrims on their\r\nknees; the mount, where once stood an altar of the Druids, became\r\na consecrated place before the Revolution.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe, in 1841, had planned the fortifications of Paris,\r\nbut in his time they had been only partially constructed. Even\r\nin 1870, as I have said, they were not complete. When the siege\r\nbecame imminent, the first thing to be done was to put them in good\r\norder; but for a week the working-men in Paris were so intoxicated\r\nwith the idea of having a republic that they could not be made to\r\ndo steady work upon anything. It was also considered necessary to\r\ncut down all trees and to destroy all villages between the forts\r\nand the walls of the city, so that they might afford no shelter\r\nto the Prussians. The poor inhabitants of these villages flocked\r\ninto Paris, bringing with them carts piled with their household\r\ngoods, their wives and children peeping out aghast between the\r\nchairs and beds. The beautiful trees in the Bois de Boulogne were\r\ncut down; the deer and the swans and other wild fowl on the lakes\r\n(long the pets of the Parisian holiday makers) were shot by parties\r\nof Mobiles sent out for that purpose.\r\n\r\nNo military man believed that Paris, defended by uncompleted\r\nfortifications, could withstand a direct attack from the Prussians;\r\nno one dreamed of a blockade, for it was thought that it would\r\ntake a million and a quarter of men to invest the city, and the\r\nPrussians were known not to have that number for the purpose. The\r\nidea was that the enemy would choose some point, would attack it\r\nwith all his forces, would lose probably thirty thousand men, and\r\nwould take the city. But Bismarck and King William and Von Moltke\r\nhad no idea of losing thirty thousand men. They were certain that\r\nthere would be risings and disturbances in Paris. They believed that\r\ntheir forces might even be called in to save respectable Parisians\r\nfrom the outrages of the Reds. They knew that rural France, having\r\nlittle love for Paris or the Republic, was not likely to accept\r\nthe Government formed without its own consent, nor march to the\r\nassistance of the capital. Even should the provincial population\r\nbestir itself, the troops it could send would be only raw levies,\r\nand there was no great leader to animate or to direct popular\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIt was quite true that the respectable classes in Paris had as\r\nmuch to fear from the Reds as from the Prussians. The mob of Paris\r\nwas wild for a commune.\r\n\r\nIt is not always known what is meant by a commune, and I may be\r\npardoned if I pause to define it here.\r\n\r\nIn feudal times cities all over Europe won for themselves charters.\r\nBy these charters they acquired the right to govern themselves;\r\nthat is, the burghers elected their own mayor and their councilor\r\naldermen, and this body governing the community was called the\r\ncommune. When the feudal system fell in France, and all power was\r\ncentralized in the king, city governments were established by royal\r\nedict only. Paris, for instance, was governed by the Prefect of the\r\nSeine,--he had under him the _maires_ of twenty Arrondissements;\r\nand thus it was in every French city. All public offices in France\r\nwere in the gift of the Throne.\r\n\r\nTo Americans, who have mayors and city councils in every city,\r\nmunicipal taxation, municipal elections, and municipal laws, a\r\ncommune appears the best mode of city government. But if we can\r\nimagine one of our large cities possessing the same power over\r\nthe United States that Paris wields over France, we shall take a\r\ndifferent view of the matter. Paris governed by a commune, that\r\ncommune being elected by a mob and aspiring to give laws to France,\r\nmight well indeed have alarmed all Frenchmen. We may judge of its\r\nfeeling towards the Provinces from the indignation expressed by\r\nParisian Communists when during the Commune, Lyons and some other\r\ncities talked of setting up communes of their own.\r\n\r\nIn olden times, in France, Italy, and Germany (as in Great Britain\r\nat the present day), it was not the mob, but the burghers, whose\r\ninterests depended upon the prosperity of their city, who voted\r\nin municipal elections. France had established universal suffrage,\r\nand the restless \"men of Belleville,\"--the \"white blouses,\"--were\r\nliable in any time of excitement to be joined by roughs from other\r\ncities, and by all working-men out of employment. These apprehensions\r\nof the respectable citizens of Paris were horribly realized in\r\n1871. The new Republic, meantime, was not Red, not Communistic,\r\nnot Socialistic, but Republican.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution of 1848 there had been little intoxication\r\nin Paris; but in the twenty-two years that followed, the French\r\nhad learned to drink absinthe and to frequent such places as\r\n\"L'Assommoir.\" All accounts speak of the drunkenness in France during\r\nthe Franco-Prussian war.\r\n\r\nMeantime, during the two weeks that preceded the arrival of the\r\nPrussians, the streets of Paris were crowded with men in every\r\nvariety of uniform,--_francs-tireurs_ in their Opéra Comique costume,\r\ncuirassiers, artillerymen, lancers, regulars, National Guards, and\r\nMobiles. Carriages were mixed up with heavy wagons loaded sometimes\r\nwith worthless household goods, sometimes with supplies. Peasants'\r\ncarts were seen in the midst of frightened flocks of sheep driven\r\nby bewildered shepherds. Everybody was in some one's way. All was\r\nconfusion, excitement,--and exhilaration.\r\n\r\nTill September 19 the railways continued to run. Then the fifty-one\r\ngates of Paris were closed, the railroad entrances were walled\r\nup, and the following notice appeared upon the walls:--\r\n\r\n\"Citizens! The last lines which connected Paris with France and\r\nEurope were cut yesterday evening. Paris is left to herself. She\r\nhas now only her own courage and her own resources to rely on.\r\nEurope, which has received so much enlightenment from this great\r\ncity, and has always felt a certain jealousy of her glory, now\r\nabandons her. But Paris, we are persuaded, will prove that she has\r\nnot ceased to be the most solid rampart of French independence.\"\r\n\r\nTo _hold out_ was the determination of all classes; but the very\r\nnext day the Reds put forth a manifesto demanding a commune, the\r\ndismissal of the police, the sequestration of the property of all\r\nrich or influential men, and a public declaration that the king of\r\nPrussia would not be treated with so long as his armies occupied\r\none foot of French soil. \"Nothing less than these things,\" said\r\nthe document, \"will satisfy the people.\"\r\n\r\nHere we see the usual assumption of the Parisian Communists that\r\nthey are \"the people.\" They have always assumed that thirty-two\r\nmillions of Frenchmen outside the walls of Paris counted for nothing.\r\n\r\nAs the Prussian armies passed to the southward of Paris to take\r\npossession of Versailles, an attack, authorized by General Trochu\r\nand by General Ducrot (who had escaped from Sedan), was made upon\r\nthe German columns. The Zouaves, who had come back to Paris under\r\nGeneral Vinoy, demoralized by the disasters of their comrades, were\r\nthe first to break and run. The poor little Mobiles stood firm\r\nand did their duty.\r\n\r\nThe official report said: \"Some of our soldiers took to flight\r\nwith regrettable haste,\"--a phrase which became a great joke among\r\nthe Parisians.\r\n\r\nThat night the Reds breathed fire and fury against the Government,\r\n\"and the respectable part of Paris,\" says M. de Sarcey, the great\r\ndramatic critic, \"saw themselves between two dangers. It would\r\nbe hard to say which of them they dreaded most. They hated the\r\nPrussians very much, but they feared the men of Belleville more.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime Jules Favre, who had been appointed Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, had procured a safe-conduct from the Prussians, and had\r\ngone out to see Count Bismarck and King William, who had their\r\nheadquarters at Baron Rothschild's beautiful country seat of Ferrières.\r\nHis object was to obtain an armistice, that a National Assembly\r\nmight be convoked which would consider the terms of peace with\r\nthe Prussians.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of North Germany declared that he did not recognize\r\nthe Committee of Defence, represented by Julus Favre, as a legitimate\r\ngovernment of France competent to offer or to consider terms of\r\npeace. He treated M. Favre with the greatest haughtiness, utterly\r\nrefusing any armistice, but at the close of their first interview\r\nhe consented to see him again the next day.\r\n\r\n\"I was,\" says Jules Favre, \"at the Château de Ferrières by eleven\r\nA. M., but Count Bismarck did not leave the king's apartments before\r\ntwelve. I then gathered from him the conditions that he demanded\r\nfor an armistice. They were written in German, and he read them\r\nover to me. He desired to occupy, as a guarantee, Strasburg, Toul,\r\nand Phalsbourg;[1] and as I had the day before named Paris as the\r\nplace for the meeting of the Assembly, he wished in that case to\r\nhave possession of some fort commanding the city. He named Fort\r\nValérien. Here I interrupted him. 'You had better ask for Paris at\r\nonce,' I said. 'How can a French Assembly be expected to deliberate\r\nwhen covered by your guns? I hardly know whether I dare to inform\r\nmy Government that you have made such a proposal.' Tours was then\r\nnamed as a place for the Assembly. 'But,' said Bismarck, 'Strasburg\r\nmust be surrendered. It is about to fall into our hands. All I\r\nask is that the garrison shall constitute themselves prisoners\r\nof war.' At this I could restrain myself no longer. I sprang to\r\nmy feet and said: 'Count Bismarck, you forget you are speaking\r\nto a Frenchman! To sacrifice an heroic garrison which has won our\r\nadmiration and that of the whole world, would be an act of cowardice.\r\nNor will I even promise to mention that you ever made such a demand.'\r\nHe answered that he had not meant to wound my feelings, he was\r\nacting in conformity with the laws of war; but he would see what\r\nthe king said about the matter. He returned in a quarter of an\r\nhour, and said that his master accepted my proposal as to Tours,\r\nbut insisted on the surrender of the garrison of Strasburg.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Places still holding out against the Germans.]\r\n\r\nAt this, the negotiation was broken off, Jules Favre concluding\r\nby saying that \"the inhabitants of Paris were resolved on making\r\nany sacrifices, and that their heroism might change the current\r\nof events.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of this account of the interview with Bismarck\r\nproduced through Paris a shiver of indignation. For a moment all\r\nparties were united, the very Reds crying out that there must be\r\nno more parties, only Frenchmen; and a slight success in a skirmish\r\nin one of the suburbs of Paris roused enthusiasm to its height in\r\na few hours.\r\n\r\nThe National Guard now did duty as police, and was also placed\r\non guard on the ramparts. Each man received thirty sous a day.\r\nThe Guard was divided into the Old Battalions and the New. The\r\nOld Battalions were composed almost entirely of gentlemen and\r\n_bourgeois_, who returned their pay to the Government; the New\r\nBattalions, which were fresh levies of working-men, preferred in\r\ngeneral a franc and a half a day for doing nothing, to higher wages\r\nfor making shoes, guns, and uniforms. In vain the Government put\r\nforth proclamations assuring the people that the man who made a\r\nchassepot rifle was more of a patriot than he who carried one.\r\n\r\nAll through September the weather was delightful, and mounting\r\nguard upon the ramparts was like taking a pleasant stroll. The\r\nMobiles occupied the forts outside of Paris, and were forbidden\r\nto come into the city in uniform. Of course there was much hunting\r\nfor Prussian spies, and many people were arrested and maltreated,\r\nthough only one genuine spy seems to have been found. The French\r\nin any popular excitement seem to have treachery upon the brain.\r\nOne phase of their mania was the belief that any light seen moving\r\nin the upper stories of a house was a signal to the Prussians;\r\nand sometimes a whole district was disturbed because some quiet\r\nstudent had sat reading late at night with a green shade over his\r\nlamp, or a mother had been nursing a sick child.\r\n\r\nAs October went on, it became a sore trial to the Parisians to\r\nbe cut off from all outside news. Not a letter nor a newspaper\r\ncrossed the lines. Even the agents of Foreign Governments, and Mr.\r\nWashburne, the only foreign ambassador in Paris, were prohibited\r\nfrom hearing from their Governments, unless all communications\r\nwere read by Bismarck before being forwarded to them. One great\r\nsource of suffering to the men in Paris who had sent away their\r\nfamilies was the knowledge that they must be in want of money.\r\nNo one had anticipated a prolonged blockade.\r\n\r\nBefore the gates had been closed, two elderly members of the Committee\r\nof Defence--Crémieux and Garnier-Pagès--had been sent out to govern\r\nthe Provinces. M. Thiers was visiting all the capitals of Europe,\r\nas a sort of ambassador-at-large, to enlist foreign diplomatic\r\nsympathy, and in October it was resolved to send out M. Gambetta,\r\nin the hope that he might organize a National Assembly, or perhaps\r\ninduce the Southern Provinces (where he had great influence) to\r\nmake a demonstration for the relief of the capital. Provincial\r\nFrance had long chafed under the idea that its government was made\r\nand unmade by the Parisians, and there was no great sympathy in the\r\nProvinces for Paris in her struggle with the Prussians, until it\r\nwas shown how nobly the city and its inhabitants bore the hardships\r\nof the siege.\r\n\r\nSmall sorties continued to be made during October, chiefly with\r\na view of accustoming raw troops to stand fire. On October 28,\r\ncame news of the surrender of Bazaine at Metz to the Prussians\r\nwith his army (including officers) of nearly one hundred and ninety\r\nthousand men. The universal cry was \"Treachery!\" The same day that\r\nthe Prussians forwarded this news into Paris, a small body of German\r\ntroops was worsted in a sortie beyond St. Denis. These two events\r\nroused the turbulent part of the population of Paris almost to\r\nfrenzy, and resulted in a rising called the _émeute_ of October\r\n31.\r\n\r\nThe disorderly classes living in the suburbs of Belleville and\r\nMontmartre (which have taken the place of the old Faubourg\r\nSaint-Antoine), assuming \"The Commune\" for their war-cry, were led\r\non by such men as Ledru-Rollin, Blanqui, and Félix Pyat.\r\n\r\n\"The party of the Commune,\" says M. de Sarcey, \"was composed partly\r\nof charlatans, partly of dupes,--that is, the real members of the\r\nCommune as a party. The rank and file were simply roughs, ready\r\nfor any mischief, and, we may add, for any plunder.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of October 31, a great crowd of these men assembled\r\nbefore the Hôtel-de-Ville, then the seat of government. General\r\nTrochu, Jules Favre, the Maire of Paris, and even Rochefort, who\r\nwas a member of the Committee of Defence, harangued them for hours\r\nwithout producing any impression. The days were passed when the\r\nmob of Paris could be controlled by a harangue. Finally, the crowd\r\nmade its way into the Hôtel-de-Ville, and endeavored to force the\r\nCommittee of Defence to issue a proclamation which would convene the\r\ncitizens to vote for a commune. The windows of the Hôtel-de-Ville\r\nwere flung open, in spite of the efforts of the members of the\r\nGovernment, and lists of the proposed Communistic rulers were flung\r\nout to the mob.\r\n\r\nMeantime the members of the existing Government were imprisoned in\r\ntheir council chamber, and threatened by armed men. Jules Favre sat\r\nquietly in his chair; Jules Simon sketched upon his blotting-paper;\r\nrifles were pointed at General Trochu. \"Escape, General!\" cried\r\nsome one in the crowd. \"I am a soldier, Citizen,\" he answered,\r\n\"and my duty is to die at my post.\" One member of the Committee\r\nmanaged, however to escape, and summoned the National Guard to\r\nthe assistance of his colleagues.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o'clock in the evening when the troops arrived. At\r\nsight of their guns and bayonets the populace, grown weary of its\r\nday's excitement, melted away. Before daylight, order was restored.\r\n\"Thus,\" says an American then in Paris, \"in twelve hours Paris\r\nhad one Republican Government taken prisoner, another set up, and\r\nthe first restored.\"\r\n\r\nSo peace, after a fashion, returned; but Count Bismarck, learning\r\nof these events, was strengthened in his determination to keep\r\nParis shut up within her gates till the factions in the city, in\r\nthe coming days of famine and distress, should destroy one another.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers had almost concluded an agreement for an armistice of\r\nthirty days, during which Paris was to be fed, while an election\r\nshould be held all over France for a National Assembly; but after\r\nthe disorders of October 31, Count Bismarck refused to hear of\r\nany food being supplied to Paris, negotiations were broken off,\r\nand the war went on.\r\n\r\nUp to this time bread in Paris had been sufficient for its needs,\r\nand not too dear. Wine was plenty, but meat was growing scarce.\r\nHorses were requisitioned for food. It was the upper classes who\r\nate horse-flesh and queer animals out of the Jardin des Plantes;\r\nthe working-classes would not touch such things till driven to\r\neat them by absolute famine.\r\n\r\nButter rose to five dollars a pound, cabbages were sold by the\r\nleaf. Early in the siege, eggs were three dollars a dozen, and milk\r\nsoon became unattainable. \"Poor little babies died like flies,\" says\r\nan eye-witness. Fuel, too, was growing very scarce and very dear.\r\nThe women supported their privations bravely, but it is terrible\r\nto think what must have been the sufferings of mothers deprived\r\nof wholesome food for their little children. The firmness and\r\nself-sacrifice of the _bourgeoisie_ were above all praise.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of meats were eaten. Mule was said to be delicious,--far\r\nsuperior to beef. Antelope cost eighteen francs a pound, but was\r\nnot as good as stewed rabbit; elephant's trunk was eight dollars\r\na pound, it being esteemed a delicacy. Bear, kangaroo, ostrich,\r\nyak, etc., varied the bill of fare for those who could afford to\r\neat them.\r\n\r\nMen of wealth who had lost everything, took their misfortunes\r\ncheerfully. While the worst qualities of the Parisians came out\r\nin some classes, the best traits of the French character shone\r\nforth in others. A great deal of charity was dispensed, both public\r\nand private and on the whole, the very poorest class was but little\r\nthe worse for the privations of the siege.\r\n\r\nThe houses left empty by their owners were made over to the refugees\r\nfrom the villages, and many amusing stories are told of their\r\nembarrassment when surrounded by objects of art, and articles of\r\nfurniture whose use was unknown to them.\r\n\r\nAt first the theatres were closed, and some of them were turned\r\ninto military hospitals; but by the beginning of November it was\r\nthought better to reopen them. At one theatre, Victor Hugo's \"Les\r\nChâtiments\" was recited,--that bitterest arraignment of Napoleon\r\nIII. and the Second Empire; at another, Beethoven and Mendelssohn\r\nwere played, with apologies for their being Germans.\r\n\r\nThe hospital parts of the theatres were railed off, and in the\r\ncorridors ballet-girls, actors, and sisters of charity mingled together.\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo was in Paris during the siege, but he lent his name\r\nto no party or demonstration. The recitation of his verses at the\r\ntheatre afforded him great delight, but the triumph was short-lived.\r\nThe attraction of \"Les Châtiments\" soon died away.\r\n\r\nThe most popular places of resort for idle men were the clubs. On\r\nNovember 21, one of these was visited by our American observer.\r\nHe says,--\r\n\r\n\"The hall was filled to suffocation. Every man present had a pipe\r\nor cigar in his mouth. It was a sulphurous place, a Pandemonium,\r\na Zoological Garden, a Pantomime, a Comedy, a Backwoods Fourth of\r\nJuly, and a Donnybrook Fair, all combined. Women too were there,\r\nthe fiercest in the place. Orators roared, and fingers were shaken.\r\nOne speech was on the infringement of the liberties of the citizen\r\nbecause soldiers were made to march left or right according to the\r\nwill of their officers. Another considered that the sluggards who\r\nwent on hospital service with red crosses on their caps were no\r\nbetter than cowards. Then they discovered a spy (as they supposed)\r\nin their midst, and time was consumed in hustling him out. Lastly\r\nan orator concluded his speech with awful blasphemy, wishing that\r\nhe were a Titan, and could drive a dagger into the Christian's\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nThe most terrible suffering in Paris during the siege was probably\r\nmental, suffering from the want of news; but by the middle of November\r\nthe balloon and pigeon postal service was organized. Balloons were\r\nmanufactured in Paris, and sent out whenever the wind was favorable.\r\nIt was found necessary, however, to send them off by night, lest they\r\nshould be fired into by the Germans. A balloon generally carried\r\none or two passengers, and was sent up from one of the now empty\r\nrailroad stations. It also generally took five small cages, each\r\ncontaining thirty-six pigeons. These pigeons were of various colors,\r\nand all named. They were expected to return soon to their homes,\r\nunless cold, fog, a hawk, or a Prnssian bullet should stop them on\r\nthe way. Each would bring back a small quill fastened by threads to\r\none of its tail-feathers and containing a minute square of flexible,\r\nwaterproof paper, on which had been photographed messages in characters\r\nso small as to be deciphered only by a microscope. Some of these\r\nwould be official despatches, some private messages. One pigeon\r\nwould carry as much as, printed in ordinary type, would fill one\r\nsheet of a newspaper. The Parisians looked upon the pigeons with\r\na kind of veneration; when one, drooping and weary, alighted on\r\nsome roof, a crowd would collect and watch it anxiously. Sometimes\r\nthey were caught by the Germans, and sent back into Paris with\r\nfalse news.\r\n\r\nOn November 15 a pigeon brought a despatch saying that the South of\r\nFrance had raised an army for the relief of Paris, and that it was\r\nin motion under an old general with the romantic name of Aurelles des\r\nPaladines, that it had driven the Prussians out of Orleans, and was\r\ncoming on with all speed to the capital. The Parisians were eager\r\nto make a sortie and to join this relieving army. General Trochu was\r\nnot so eager, having no great confidence in his _francs-tireurs_, his\r\nNational Guard, and his Mobiles. They numbered in all four hundred\r\nthousand men; but eighty thousand serviceable soldiers would have\r\nbeen worth far more.\r\n\r\nOn November 28, however, the sortie was made; and had the expected\r\narmy been at hand, it might have been successful. The Parisians\r\ncrossed the Marne, and fought the Prussians so desperately that in\r\ntwo days they had lost more men than in the battles at Gravelotte.\r\nBut on the third day an order was given to return to Paris; the\r\nGovernment had received reliable information that the Army of the\r\nLoire (under Aurelles des Paladines) had met with a reverse, and\r\nwould form no junction with the Parisian forces.\r\n\r\nBy the end of November cannon had been cast in the beleaguered city,\r\npaid for, not by the Government, but by individual subscription.\r\nThese guns were subsequently to playa tragic part in the history\r\nof the city. Some carried farther than the Prussian guns. All of\r\nthem had names. The favorite was called Josephine, and was a great\r\npet with the people.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day of that sad year arrived at last, and New Year's\r\nDay, the great and joyful fête-day in all French families. A few\r\nconfectioners kept their stores open, and a few boxes of bonbons\r\nwere sold; but presents of potatoes, or small packages of coffee,\r\nwere by this time more acceptable gifts. Nothing was plenty in\r\nParis but champagne and Colman's mustard. The rows upon rows of the\r\nlast-named article in the otherwise empty windows of the grocers\r\nreminded Englishmen and Americans of Grumio's cruel offer to poor\r\nKatherine of the mustard without the beef, since she could not\r\nhave the beef with the mustard.\r\n\r\nHere is the bill-of-fare of a dinner given at a French restaurant\r\nupon that Christmas Day:--\r\n\r\n  Soup from horse meat.\r\n  Mince of cat.\r\n  Shoulder of dog with tomato sauce.\r\n  Jugged cat with mushrooms.\r\n  Roast donkey and potatoes.\r\n  Rat, peas, and celery.\r\n  Mice on toast.\r\n  Plum pudding.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable feature of the siege was that everybody's appetite\r\nincreased enormously. Thinking about food stimulated the craving\r\nfor it, and by New Year's Day there were serious apprehensions of\r\nfamine. The reckless waste of bread and breadstuffs in the earlier\r\ndays of the siege was now repented of. Flour had to be eked out with\r\nall sorts of things, and the bread eaten during the last weeks of the\r\nsiege was a black and sticky mixture made up of almost anything but\r\nflour. All Paris was rationed. Poor mothers, leaving sick children\r\nat home, stood for hours in the streets, in the bitter cold, to\r\nobtain a ration of horseflesh, or a few ounces of this unnutritious\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nAfter news came of the retreat of the Army of the Loire, great\r\ndiscouragement crept over the garrison. The Mobiles from the country,\r\nwho had never expected to be shut up in Paris for months, began to\r\npine for their families and villages. What might not be happening\r\nto them? and they far away!\r\n\r\nEvery day there was a panic of some kind in the beleaguered city,--some\r\nrumor, true or false, to stir men's souls. Besides this, the garrison\r\nhad for months been idle, and was consumed with _ennui_. Among the\r\nprevailing complaints was one that General Trochu was too pious!\r\nThey might have said of him with truth, that, though brave and\r\ndetermined when once in action, he was wanting in decision. The\r\ngarrison in Paris had no general who could stir their hearts,--no\r\nleader of men. General Trochu, and the rulers under him, waited to\r\nbe moved by public opinion. They were ready to do what the masses\r\nwould dictate, but seemed not to be able to lead them. In a besieged\r\ncity the population generally bends to the will of one man; in\r\nthis case it was one man, or a small body of men, who bent to the\r\nwill of the people.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1871 was the coldest that had been known for twenty\r\nyears. Fuel and warm clothing grew scarce. The Rothschilds distributed\r\n$20,000 worth of winter garments among the suffering; and others\r\nfollowed their example, till there was no warm clothing left to buy;\r\nbut the suffering in every home was intense, and at last soldiers\r\nwere brought in frozen from the ramparts. There was of course no\r\ngas, and the city was dimly lighted by petroleum. Very great zeal\r\nwas shown throughout Paris for hospital service. French military\r\nhospitals and the service connected with them are called \"ambulances.\"\r\n\"We were all full of recollections,\" says M. de Sarcey, \"of the\r\nexertions made on both sides in the American Civil War. Our model\r\nhospital was formed on the American Plan.\"\r\n\r\nThe American Sanitary Commission had sent out specimens of hospital\r\nappliances to the Exposition Universelle of 1867. These had remained\r\nin Paris, and the hospital under canvas, when set up, excited great\r\nadmiration. Everything was for use; nothing for show. \"The four\r\ngreat medicines that we recognize,\" said the American surgeon in\r\ncharge, \"are fresh air, hot and cold water, opium, and quinine.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the bravest and most active litter-bearers were the Christian\r\nBrothers,--men not priests, but vowed to poverty, celibacy, and\r\nthe work of education. \"They advanced wherever bullets fell,\" says\r\nM. de Sarcey, \"to pick up the dead or wounded; recoiling from no\r\ntask, however laborious or distasteful; never complaining of their\r\nfood, drinking only water; and after their stretcher-work was done,\r\nreturning to their humble vocation of teachers, without dreaming\r\nthat they had played the part of heroes.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Bazaine surrendered at Metz, eager hopes had been entertained\r\nthat the army raised in the South by Chanzy and Gambetta might\r\nunite with his one hundred and seventy-two thousand soldiers in\r\nMetz, and march to the relief of Paris; but to this day no one\r\nknows precisely why Bazaine took no steps in furtherance of this\r\nplan, but, instead, surrendered ignominiously to the Germans. It\r\nis supposed that being attached to the emperor, and dreading a\r\nRepublic, he declined to fight for France if it was to benefit\r\n\"the rabble Government of Paris,\" as he called the Committee of\r\nPublic Defence. He seems to have thought that the Germans, after\r\ntaking Paris, would make peace, exacting Alsace and Lorraine, and\r\nthen restore the emperor.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been braver or more brilliant than the efforts\r\nof Chanzy and Gambetta on the Loire. At one time they were actually\r\nnear compelling the Prussians to raise the siege of Paris; for\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand men was a small army to invest so\r\nlarge a city. But the one hundred and fifty thousand German soldiers\r\nwho were besieging Metz were enabled by Bazaine's surrender to\r\nreinforce the troops beleaguering the capital.\r\n\r\nGambetta seems to have been at that time the only man in France\r\nwho showed himself to be a true leader of men, and amidst numerous\r\ndisadvantages he did nobly. He and Chanzy died twelve years later,\r\nwithin a week of each other.\r\n\r\nFrom September 19, when the siege began, up to December 27, the\r\nParisian soldiers, four hundred thousand in number (such as they\r\nwere) had never, except in occasional sorties, encountered the\r\nPrussians, nor had any shot from Prussian guns entered their city.\r\nOn the night of December 27 the bombardment began. It commenced\r\nby clearing what was called the Plateau d'Avron, to the east of\r\nParis. The weather was intensely cold, the earth as hard as iron\r\nand as slippery as glass. The French do not rough their horses\r\neven in ordinary times, and slipperiness is a public calamity in\r\na French city. The troops, stationed with little shelter on the\r\nPlateau d'Avron, had no notion that the Germans had been preparing\r\nmasked batteries. The first shells that fell among them produced\r\nindescribable confusion. The men rushed to their own guns to reply,\r\nbut their balls fell short about five hundred yards. It became\r\nevident that the Plateau d'Avron must be abandoned, and that night,\r\nin the cold and the darkness, together with the slippery condition\r\nof the ground, which was worst of all, General Trochu superintended\r\nthe removal of all the cannon. The Prussian batteries were admirably\r\nplaced and admirably served.\r\n\r\nBut tremendous as the bombardment was (sometimes a shell every two\r\nminutes), it is astonishing how little real damage it did to the\r\ncity. The streets were wide, the open spaces numerous, the houses\r\nsolidly built, with large courtyards. In the middle of January,\r\nwhen the extreme cold moderated, hundreds of people would assemble\r\nin the Place de la Concorde, looking skyward. A black object would\r\nappear, with a small bright spot in it, and making a graceful curve\r\nin the air, with a whizzing, humming sound, would drop suddenly,\r\nwith a resounding boom, in some distant quarter in the city. Then\r\nthe spectators, greatly interested in the sight, waited for another.\r\nThe shells, which the Parisians called \"obus,\" were like an\r\nold-fashioned sugar-loaf, and weighed sometimes one hundred and\r\nfifty pounds. But though, by reason of the great distance of the\r\nPrussian batteries, the damage was by no means in proportion to\r\nthe number of shells sent into the city, many of them struck public\r\nbuildings, hospitals, and orphan asylums, in spite of the Red Cross\r\nflags displayed above them.\r\n\r\nBy January 19, when the siege had lasted four months, and the\r\nbombardment three weeks, the end seemed to be drawing near. Another\r\nsortie was attempted; but there was a dense fog, the usual accompaniment\r\nof a January thaw, and its only result was the loss of some very\r\nvaluable lives.\r\n\r\nThen General Trochu asked for an armistice of two days to bury\r\nthe dead; but his real object was that Jules Favre might enter the\r\nPrussian lines and endeavor to negotiate. Before this took place,\r\nhowever, Trochu himself resigned his post as military governor. He\r\nhad sworn that under him Paris should never capitulate. General\r\nVinoy took his command.\r\n\r\nThe moment the Government of Defence was known to be in extreme\r\ndifficulty, the Communists issued proclamations and provoked risings.\r\nThe Hôtel-de-Ville was again attacked. In this rising famished\r\nwomen took a prominent part. Twenty-six people were killed in the\r\n_émeute_, and only twenty-eight by that day's bombardment.\r\n\r\nOn January 23 Jules Favre went out to Versailles. Paris was hushed.\r\nIt was not known that negotiations were going on, but all felt\r\nthat the end was near at hand. No one, dared to say the word\r\n\"capitulate,\" though some of the papers admitted that by February\r\n3 there would not be a mouthful of bread in the city.\r\n\r\nOn January 27 the Parisians learned their fate. The following\r\nannouncement appeared in the official journal:\r\n\r\n\"So long as the Government could count on an army of relief, it was\r\ntheir duty to neglect nothing that could conduce to the prolongation\r\nof the defence of Paris. At present our armies, though still in\r\nexistence, have been driven back by the fortune of war.... Under\r\nthese circumstances the Government has been absolutely compelled to\r\nnegotiate. We have reason to believe that the principle of national\r\nsovereignty will be kept intact by the speedy calling of an Assembly;\r\nthat during the armistice the German army will occupy our forts;\r\nthat we shall preserve intact our National Guards and one division\r\nof our army; and that none of our soldiers will be conveyed beyond\r\nour frontier as prisoners of war.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was so inevitable that it did not spread the grief and\r\nconsternation we have known in many modern cases of surrender.\r\nThose who suffered most from the sorrow of defeat were not the\r\nRed brawlers of Belleville, who cried loudest that they had been\r\nbetrayed, but the honest, steady-going _bourgeoisie_, who for love\r\nof their country had for four months borne the burden and distress\r\nof resistance.\r\n\r\nDuring the four months of siege sixty-five thousand persons perished\r\nin Paris: ten thousand died in hospitals, three thousand were killed\r\nin battle, sixty-six hundred were destroyed by small-pox, and as\r\nmany by bronchitis and pneumonia. The babies, who died chiefly\r\nfor want of proper food, numbered three thousand,--just as many\r\nas the soldiers who fell in battle.\r\n\r\nTwo sad weeks passed, the Parisians meanwhile waiting for the meeting\r\nof a National Assembly. During those weeks the blockade of Paris\r\ncontinued, and the arrival of provisions was frequently retarded\r\nat the Prussian outposts; nor were provision-carts safe when they\r\nhad passed beyond the Prussian lines, for there were many turbulent\r\nParisians lying in wait to rob them. All Paris was eager for fresh\r\nfish and for white bread. The moment the gates were opened, twenty-five\r\nthousand persons poured out of the city, most of whom were in a\r\nstate of anxiety and uncertainty where to find their families.\r\n\r\nAt last peace was made. One of its conditions was that the Germans\r\nwere to occupy two of the forts that commanded Paris until that city\r\npaid two hundred millions of francs ($40,000,000) as its ransom. It\r\nwas also stipulated that the Prussian army was to make a triumphal\r\nentry into the city, not going farther, however, than the Place\r\nde la Concorde.\r\n\r\nThis took place March I, 1871, but was witnessed by none of the\r\nrespectable Parisians, although the German soldiers were surrounded\r\nby a hooting crowd, whom they seemed to regard with little attention.\r\n\r\nThus ended the siege of Paris, and the day afterwards the homeward\r\nmarch of the Germans was begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRUSSIANS IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian army was more than two weeks on the road from Sedan\r\nto Paris and Versailles, and it was just one month after the French\r\nemperor surrendered before the king of Prussia made his headquarters\r\nin the beautiful city which seems to enshrine the memory of Louis\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, September 18, a scouting party of three Uhlans made\r\ntheir appearance at the gates of Versailles. They had in fact lost\r\ntheir way, and stumbled unawares upon the city; however, they rode\r\nboldly up to the gate, demanded admittance, and presented themselves\r\nat the _mairie_, bringing terror and dismay to the inhabitants.\r\nWhen the _maire_ presented himself at their summons, they demanded\r\non what terms Versailles would surrender? He replied that he could\r\nnot treat with private soldiers, but must see their officers. \"Oh,\r\nour officers are close at hand,\" they replied; \"they are waiting\r\nwith a large force in yonder woods. If you come to the gate, they\r\nwill meet you there.\" The _maire_ assented, and the audacious Uhlans\r\ngalloped safely away. Let us hope that at their firesides in the\r\nfar-off Fatherland they still laugh over this unparalleled adventure.\r\n\r\nA few hours later, news was received at Versailles that fighting\r\nwas going on towards the south of Paris between French troops and\r\nthe Prussians; and all the inhabitants, including foreign residents,\r\nwere busy in preparing supplies for the field-hospitals,--lint,\r\nbandages, water-cans, and pillows stuffed with torn paper. Before\r\nlong, eight Prussians and an officer entered the city. They were\r\nthus described by one who saw them as they dashed up to the _mairie_\r\nthrough an excited crowd:--\r\n\r\n\"They were small men. They had light hair, but were very thick-set.\r\nThey looked very tired, and were covered with dust and with torn\r\nclothes: but they had good horses. They wore the Prussian helmet\r\nand spike, and were well armed, with a sabre on one side and on\r\nthe other a huge horse-pistol two feet long, while they carried\r\ncarbines in their hands, all ready to shoot if occasion offered. But\r\nall the French soldiers had left Versailles, except a few National\r\nGuards. The inhabitants looked very sad; the women were crying,\r\nand the men looked as if they would like to. We walked on, when\r\nsuddenly we saw a troop of horsemen come through an arch that spanned\r\none of the main roads; behind came more, and more, and more. The\r\nfirst were fifty Uhlans. These fellows were in blue, on horseback,\r\nvery handsome. Then came some men with silver death's-heads and\r\ncrossbones on their caps; then hundreds and hundreds of mounted\r\nfellows with needle-guns and sabres; then three regiments of infantry,\r\nmarching in superb time. Every five hundred men had a drum corps\r\nand fifes playing in perfect unison. You could almost feel the\r\nground shake with the steady thud of their march as they tramped\r\non. The men looked dirty and tired, but were fat, and many of them\r\nwere laughing. Looking down the road as far as possible, we could\r\nstill see helmets, spikes, and guns all leaning exactly the same\r\nway, and glittering in the sunshine. All the officers looked like\r\ngentlemen, with great whiskers, and jolly, fat faces. None of the\r\nmen talked, much less sang, as the French do. When these had passed,\r\nthere came a splendid band of sixty pieces, playing beautifully,\r\nand then regiment after regiment of cavalry (not carrying as much,\r\nnearly, as the French cavalry do). Their horses were in excellent\r\norder, many of them very handsome. Lots of the soldiers were smoking\r\ngreat German pipes.\r\n\r\n\"This was the army of the Crown Prince, less than a third of those\r\nthat entered the city. They passed through Versailles, only stopping\r\nto repair the roads torn up by the peasantry. Next came artillery\r\nand baggage-wagons, and carts of ammunition; more infantry, more\r\nbands, fifty pontoons on carts; more cavalry; then hundreds of\r\nsoldiers on peasants' carts, which they had requisitioned as they\r\npassed through the country; then ambulances and carts, full of\r\nwounded, who were brought to the Hôtel des Reservoirs and to the\r\nPalace. They began to pass at half-past one, and were passing three\r\nhours; and I saw just as many more going by another road, where\r\nthey passed till seven in the evening. There seemed, at times, to\r\nbe a hunting corps, for every man would have a fat hare or rabbit,\r\nor hens, ducks, pheasants, or partridges slung on his back. One\r\nman I saw with a live sheep, full grown, over his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Only four regiments of infantry, one of cavalry, and four batteries\r\nof artillery remained in Versailles that night. They camped upon\r\nthe Place d'Armes, lit fires, and cooked. Everything was remarkable\r\nfor neatness; the cannon and powder-carts were arranged in order\r\nin a circle, horses all fastened inside the circle, soldiers all\r\nsleeping round it. They took off their knapsacks, stacked their\r\nguns, put their helmets on the top of their bayonets, unrolled\r\ntheir great-coats, and lay down, still wearing sword and pistols,\r\nwith their guns at arm's length. Thus they pass the night, rain\r\nor shine (they have no tents) and they look as hardy and strong\r\nas lions.\r\n\r\n\"By the time the Prussians were fairly in their quarters the inhabitants\r\nof Versailles seemed to take heart and to be much less frightened.\r\nMany French peasants could talk German, and conversed freely with\r\nthe Prussians, interpreting what they said to an eager crowd. The\r\nsoldiers seemed to be well fed; we saw them dining on bread and\r\ncheese, butter, sausages, and wine. In the evening they were very\r\njolly. Fires flickered all around; the soldiers sat singing and\r\nsmoking. Some milked cows that they had stolen, and some were cooking\r\ngame. The formal way in which everything was done was very curious.\r\nAt the gate of every house where officers were quartered were two\r\nsentries, and every time an officer passed, these men were obliged\r\nto go through five movements with their guns. On all the doors\r\nof all the houses the names of the officers stationed there were\r\nmarked in chalk, and a field-telegraph line in the streets connected\r\nevery such house with the _mairie_.\"\r\n\r\nThis account of the entry of the Prussians into Versailles is from\r\nthe private letter of a very young man, with the eye of an artist\r\nand a keen love of music and fine horses. The letter was seen by\r\nthe editor of the \"Nation,\" who requested leave to publish it.\r\nThe writer says further,--\r\n\r\n\"I got up at seven on the morning of September 20, and went down\r\nto the Place d'Armes. It was filled with Prussian soldiers; some\r\nwere sleeping, some were cooking, some eating, some grooming horses,\r\nsome washing cannon, and all were smoking. There were but two tents,\r\nbelonging to high officers. One of these was dressing in the open\r\nair before his tent. A guard paced up and down with a drawn sword.\r\nWhen I got there, he was brushing his hair and putting on his cravat,\r\nwhile a little French boy held a looking-glass for him. He had a\r\nbright red shirt on, and riding-boots up to his hips, and silver\r\nspurs. I saw his horse brought up, a beautiful, great black one.\r\nHis coat was covered all over with decorations, and he had a very\r\nbrilliant sword. In the other tent there were two officers writing.\r\nThey had about fifty bottles of claret and champagne stacked up\r\nbeside them, and a guard set over it.\r\n\r\n\"In a little while all was bustle, but no confusion. All the cannon\r\nand powder-carts were ranged in numerical order; the horses the\r\nsame; and every bucket and every pot was numbered like the cart to\r\nwhich it belonged. Soon as the bugles sounded, every man jumped,\r\nand knew what he had to do. There was ringing and rattling of chains,\r\nand the horses were fastened to the cannon, the soldiers gobbled\r\ntheir last mouthfuls, strapped on their knapsacks, and in a few\r\nminutes everything was in motion, officers giving their orders;\r\nthe horses neighed, the line was formed, and off they went.\r\n\r\n\"That afternoon we saw some French peasants brought in; they had\r\nfired on the men who were stealing their carts, horses, and cows,\r\nand were to be shot. It was very sorrowful. We heard afterwards\r\nthat the Crown Prince had pardoned them. Some noble-looking Zouave\r\nprisoners[1] were also brought in, and the crowd cheered them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Possibly some of the men who had shown \"regrettable\r\nhaste\" the day before.]\r\n\r\n\"About one P. M. a squad of Uhlans, with long lances and black-and-white\r\nflags came in; then came other men leading horses, all very handsome,\r\nbelonging to the Crown Prince. Then came the royal baggage, cart\r\nafter cart, mostly painted purple, with a great gold crown; but\r\nsome carts had once been French. One of the bands had a brass drum,\r\nwith the imperial eagle and 3d Zouaves painted on it. They showed\r\nit to the bystanders and laughed. We found that the Crown Prince\r\nwas to be received at the prefecture,--a handsome building with a\r\nlarge court in front, and a black-and-gilt _grille_, such as they\r\nhave round the palace and park. We went there at once. A guard\r\nof honor was drawn up in front, and a full band on each side of\r\nthe gate. The Crown Prince was surrounded by a splendid staff.\r\nHe is quite handsome, with large bushy beard and moustache. He\r\nwas dressed like his officers, and wore a cap such as they all\r\nwear, with a scarlet band; but he had lots of decorations and a\r\nsplendid diamond star. They all had most beautiful horses, and the\r\neffect was very kingly. The bands played, and the troops presented\r\narms. The prince rode in first, then all followed him into the\r\ncourtyard. They took possession, and the gates were closed. The\r\nnext day the prince left to join the king at Ferrières. The palace\r\nis appropriated to the Prussian wounded.\"\r\n\r\nBy September 23 the Prussians had completed their investment of\r\nParis. They were only two hundred and fifty thousand men, but,\r\ndisciplined as we can see they were by the letter I have quoted,\r\nthey were more than a match for the four hundred thousand disorganized\r\nand undisciplined crowd within the walls of the capital, who called\r\nthemselves soldiers.\r\n\r\nStrasburg surrendered on the very day that the Crown Prince of\r\nPrussia and his brilliant suite entered Versailles. Strasburg is\r\nthe capital city of Alsace, and is considered the central point\r\nin the defence of the Rhine frontier. It has a glorious cathedral,\r\nand a library unsurpassed in its collection of historical documents\r\nof antiquity. It is an arch-bishopric, and had always been defended\r\nby a large garrison. With Paris, Lyons, Bordeaux, Marseilles, and\r\nRouen, it had stood foremost among French cities. It contained,\r\nwhen invested, twenty thousand fighting men, and it was besieged\r\nat first by a corps of about sixty thousand. Its investment was\r\none of the first acts of the Germans on entering France. Strasburg\r\nmade an heroic resistance for six weeks, and surrendered on the\r\nday when Jules Favre was assuring Count Bismarck that France would\r\nnever repay the services of its heroic garrison by consenting to\r\ngive them up as prisoners of war. Before its surrender it suffered\r\nsix days' bombardment. A bombardment is far more destructive to a\r\nsmall town than to a city of \"magnificent distances\" like Paris.\r\nBy September 9, a week after Sedan, ninety-eight Prussian rifled\r\ncannon and forty mortars were placed in position and directed against\r\nthe walls of Strasburg, while forty other pieces were to bombard\r\nthe citadel. By September 12 the defences of the city were laid in\r\nruins. Two weeks after, it surrendered. The Mobiles and National\r\nGuards, being Alsatians, were sent to their homes; the remaining five\r\nthousand men, who were regular soldiers, were marched as prisoners\r\nof war into Germany. Hardly a house in Strasburg remained untouched\r\nby shells. The ordinary provisions were exhausted. The only thing\r\neatable, of which there was abundance, was Strasburg pie, _paté de\r\nfoie gras_,--the year's production of that delicacy having been\r\nstored in Strasburg for exportation.\r\n\r\nThe famous library was greatly injured, but the cathedral was not\r\nmaterially hurt. A German who had been in Hamburg during the time\r\nof the great fire, assured an English reporter that the scene of\r\ndesolation in that city on the morning after the conflagration\r\nwas less heart-rending than that presented by the ruined quarters\r\nof Strasburg when the Prussian conquerors marched in. And yet the\r\ninhabitants, had General Ulrich been willing, would have still\r\nfought on.\r\n\r\nMetz capitulated one month after Strasburg, Oct. 27, 1870. Three\r\nmarshals of France, six thousand officers, and one hundred and\r\nseventy-three thousand men surrendered to the Germans. Many were\r\nentirely demoralized; but the Garde Impériale, a body of picked\r\ntroops, was faithful to the last.\r\n\r\n\"That a vast army which had given ample proof of military worth in\r\nthe two great battles of Gravelotte, and which moreover possessed\r\nthe support of the most important stronghold in France, should have\r\npermitted a scarcely superior enemy to hem it in and to detain\r\nit for weeks, making no earnest attempt to escape, and finally, at\r\nthe conqueror's bidding, should have laid down its arms without\r\nstriking a blow, would before the event,\" says an English military\r\nauthority, \"have seemed impossible. It set the investing force\r\nfree to crush the new-made Army of the Loire, and it occurred in\r\nthe nick of time to prevent the raising of the siege of Paris,\r\nwhich the Germans had in contemplation.\"\r\n\r\nSmaller places held out nobly,--Phalsbourg in Alsace, and Thionville\r\nand Toul, but above all Belfort. Garibaldi was there with a considerable\r\nbody of Italians and a contingent of two hundred well-armed Greeks.\r\nThere was great jealousy of Garibaldi and his Italians in the Southern\r\narmy, and their outrageous conduct towards priests and churches\r\nset against them the women and the peasantry.\r\n\r\nBelfort never surrendered. But the army under Bourbaki, called\r\nthe Army of the East, nearly a hundred thousand strong, suffered\r\nhorribly in the latter days of the struggle. It was not included in\r\nthe armistice made at the close of January, 1871, between Bismarck\r\nand Jules Favre, for Favre was in total ignorance of its position.\r\nBourbaki attempted suicide. His soldiers, shoeless, tentless, and\r\nunprovided with provisions, pushed into the defiles of the Jura\r\nin the depths of one of the coldest winters ever known in Europe,\r\nhoping to escape into Switzerland. Eighty thousand men made their\r\nway over the mountains; fifteen thousand were made prisoners. A\r\nfew escaped to their homes. A correspondent who saw them after\r\nthey reached safety, said,--\r\n\r\n\"In all of them, pinched features and a slouching gait told of\r\ngnawing hunger, while their hollow voices told of nights spent\r\non snow and frozen ground. Some had tied bits of wood under their\r\nbare feet to keep them from the stones. For weeks none had washed,\r\nor changed their clothes. Their hands were black as Africans'. For\r\nthree days neither food nor fodder had been served out to them,\r\nand before that they had only got one four-pound loaf among eight\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nWhile men were thus suffering in the mountains, an event of the\r\ngreatest political importance was taking place at Versailles. On\r\nJanuary 19, a week before the capitulation of Paris, the king of\r\nPrussia received a deputation from the German Reichstag, offering\r\nhim the imperial crown of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Federal States of the German Empire up to the close of the\r\nlast century were three hundred and sixty; many of these were only\r\nfree cities or extremely small duchies or principalities. There\r\nwas a German emperor and a German Diet. The latter met always at\r\nFrankfort. The emperor might be of any family or of any religion.\r\nHis successor was elected during his lifetime, to be ready in case\r\nof accident, and was called King of the Romans. The emperor was\r\nat first chosen by the princes at large, but in process of time\r\nthe choice was made over to nine princes, called electors. After\r\n1438, all emperors of Germany were of the house of Hapsburg, the\r\nroyal family of Austria. This was not law, but custom. In the days\r\nof Napoleon I. the old German Empire was broken up. The title of\r\nEmperor of Germany was discontinued, though he who would have borne\r\nit still held an imperial title as Emperor of Austria. The small\r\nGerman princes were mediatized; that is, pensioned, and reduced\r\nfrom sovereign princes to the condition of mere nobles. In place\r\nof three hundred and sixty States there remained thirty-six States,\r\ncomposing the German Confederation. A new German Federal Constitution\r\nwas formed; the States agreed to defend one another, to do nothing\r\nto injure one another, and to abstain from making war upon one\r\nanother. There were practically seventeen votes in the Diet, some\r\nof the larger States having several, and many of the smaller States\r\nuniting in the possession of one.\r\n\r\nThis Constitution also was swept away in 1866, after the brilliant\r\ncampaign of Sadowa.\r\n\r\nThe great desire of patriotic Germans was to consolidate Germany,--to\r\nmake her strong; and while Prussia, assisted by all the North German\r\nStates and by Bavaria, Baden, Würtemberg, and Darmstadt, was fighting\r\nFrance, a new Federal, Constitution was formed.\r\n\r\nThe king of Prussia was chosen German emperor, and the imperial\r\ncrown was to be hereditary in his family. There is a Diet, or Federal\r\nCongress, composed of two Houses, the Upper House being limited\r\nto sovereign princes or their representatives, the other, called\r\nthe Reichstag, being really the governing power of the nation.\r\nEach State is entitled also to its own legislature.\r\n\r\nIn the Reichstag, Prussia has nearly two thirds of the votes; and\r\nits power is much greater than that of our Congress at Washington.\r\nThe emperor can veto its decisions only when they affect changes\r\nin the constitution. The Diet can dethrone any emperor if he is\r\nconsidered incapable of governing, or supposed to be dangerous\r\nto the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nPractically the power of Prussia seems boundless in the federation;\r\nshe enforces her military system on all Germany, and the smaller\r\nStates submit to her, for the sake of strength and unity.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 18, 1871, a deputation of fifty members of the Reichstag\r\ncame to the king of Prussia's headquarters at Versailles to implore\r\nhim to accept the imperial crown of Germany. The world's attention\r\nwas engrossed by the campaign which was then drawing to a close, and\r\nthe offering of the imperial crown to the Prussian sovereign formed\r\nonly a dramatic episode in the history of the war. Fortunately, as\r\nthe deputies passed Paris, shivering in their furs, while transported\r\nin carriages of all descriptions, the Parisians made no sortie to\r\nintercept them, and they reached Versailles in safety.\r\n\r\nThe French seemed perfectly indifferent on the occasion. \"Do as\r\nyou like,\" seemed to be the feeling. \"Have an empire if you think\r\nproper. It is no concern of ours. We are glad to have got rid of\r\nour own.\"\r\n\r\nThe day on which the deputies offered their great gift to King\r\nWilliam was clear and bright. Before the prefecture at Versailles\r\nwas planted the Prussian royal standard,--a black cross on a ground\r\nof gold and purple. Round the gateway stood all the Prussian soldiers\r\nwho were off duty, waiting to see the deputies pass in. There was\r\nno music, but shots boomed from Paris from time to time. There\r\nwas to be thenceforward one Germany, and one flag for the land\r\nof so many princes, who all waived their claims in favor of the\r\ngreatest among them,--he who now stood conqueror in a foreign land.\r\n\r\nThe chief room of the prefecture was filled with men in bright\r\nuniforms, with helmets, ribbons, and decorations of all kinds. The\r\nking stood near the fireplace, surrounded by princes and generals.\r\nThe president of the North German Confederation appointed to address\r\nhim had once before, in 1849, offered the imperial crown to a Prussian\r\nking, who had declined it. Since then events had ripened. This time\r\nthe king accepted what his countrymen desired he should receive\r\nfrom them. But he declined to assume the title of emperor until\r\nthe South German people should express their acquiescence, as the\r\nSouth German princes had already done.\r\n\r\nWe may contrast the conduct of the Prussian king with the unwisdom\r\nof the French emperor. Both Napoleon III. and the Emperor William\r\ngoverned as autocrats; but with what different men they surrounded\r\nthemselves, and how differently they were served in their hour of\r\nneed! Yet Napoleon III. was lavish of rewards to his adherents,\r\nwhile the Emperor William was, to an excessive degree, chary of\r\nrecompense. He seemed to feel that each man owed his all to his\r\nkaiser and his country, and that when he had given all, he could\r\nonly say, in the words of Scripture: \"I have but done that it was\r\nmy duty to do.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Jules Favre went to Versailles to negotiate with the German\r\nemperor and his chancellor for the surrender of Paris, he was\r\naccompanied, on his second and subsequent visits, by a young officer\r\nof ordnance, Count d'Hérisson, who attended him as a sort of\r\naide-de-camp. Nothing could be less alike than the two men: Jules\r\nFavre, of the upper middle class in life, deeply sorrowful, oppressed\r\nby his responsibility, and profoundly conscious of his situation; and\r\nthe young man whose birth placed him in the ranks of the _jeunesse\r\ndorée_, pleased to find himself in plenty and in good society, and\r\nallowing his spirits to rise with even more than national buoyancy,\r\nwhen, for a moment, the pressure of trouble was removed. D'Hérisson\r\npublished an account of his experience while at the Prussian\r\nheadquarters, which gives so vivid a picture of Count Bismarck,\r\nthe great chancellor of the German Empire, that I here venture\r\nto repeat some parts of his narrative. He says,--\r\n\r\n\"On January 23 I received a summons from Jules Favre. He seized\r\nme by both hands, and asked me to carry, early the next morning,\r\na despatch to M. de Bismarck, and to get it into his hands before\r\ndaybreak. No one was to know of this despatch except the German\r\nofficer bearing a flag of truce, to whom I was to give it with\r\nmy own hand. 'Then all is over?' I said to Jules Favre. 'Yes,' he\r\nanswered, 'we have only bread enough for a few more days. God only\r\nknows what the people of Paris may do to us when we are forced to\r\nlet them know the truth. We must do our best to guard against the\r\ndisastrous consequences of their strong feeling of patriotism. The\r\nGovernment does not intend to rid itself of its responsibilities,\r\nbut its first duty is to provide bread for the capital.'\r\n\r\n\"With some difficulty,\" continued d'Hérisson, \"I reached Sèvres,\r\nand the next morning before daybreak gave Jules Favre's letter\r\nto the Prussian officer. I sent back an express to Jules Favre\r\nwith the news, and then went to Baron Rothschild's desolated villa\r\nat Suresnes to wait the answer. Two hours later, came a message\r\nfrom the French officer commanding the nearest outpost to say that\r\na flag of truce had brought word that M. de Bismarck would see M.\r\nJules Favre, and that a carriage would be in waiting on the left\r\nbank of the Seine to take him to headquarters.\"\r\n\r\nThis knowledge of the negotiation at the French outposts was a\r\ndisclosure that Jules Favre had desired to avoid.\r\n\r\n\"When I brought Jules Favre the news,\" continues d'Hérisson, \"he\r\nwas greatly moved. His hands trembled so that he could hardly break\r\nthe seal of the letter.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _JULES FAVRE_.]\r\n\r\nSeeing that news of what was passing would most certainly be brought\r\nin from the outposts, it seemed best that the French Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs should start at once for the interview. There was\r\nin the courtyard a _coupé_ with a handsome horse, once belonging\r\nto Napoleon III., and driven by one of his former coachmen. Jules\r\nFavre at once got into it, with his son-in-law and M. d'Hérisson.\r\nThey passed with some difficulty through the Bois de Boulogne, the\r\nroads having been torn up and trees felled in every direction. On\r\nreaching a French outpost Jules Favre, afraid of being recognized,\r\nconcealed his face. Their only means of crossing the Seine at Sèvres\r\nwas to take a small boat which had served General Burnside a few days\r\nbefore. But the Prussians had been making a target of it ever since,\r\nand it was riddled with bullets. Having bailed it out, however,\r\nwith an old saucepan, they stuffed their handkerchiefs into the\r\nworst leaks, and crossed the Seine in safety.\r\n\r\nIn a miserable old carriage, attended by a Prussian escort, Jules\r\nFavre was borne away to his terrible interview with Bismarck, leaving\r\nd'Hérisson behind. Favre did not come back for many hours. His\r\nfirst words to his aide-de-camp were: \"Oh, my dear fellow, I was\r\nwrong to go without you. What have I not suffered?\"\r\n\r\nHe had been taken at once to a very modest house in Versailles,\r\nwhere Bismarck had his quarters. After the first salutations Jules\r\nFavre said that he came to renew the negotiations broken off at\r\nFerrières. Here Bismarck interrupted him, saying: \"The situation\r\nis changed. If you are still going to say, 'Not an inch, not a\r\nstone,' as you did at Ferrières, we may break off at once. My time\r\nis valuable, and yours too.\" Then suddenly he added: \"Your hair has\r\ngrown much grayer than it was at Ferrières.\" Jules Favre replied that\r\nthat was due to anxiety and the cares of government. The chancellor\r\nanswered that the Government of Paris had put off a long time asking\r\nfor peace, and that he had been on the eve of making an arrangement\r\nwith an envoy from Napoleon III. He then explained that it would\r\nbe easy for him to bring back the emperor and to force France to\r\nreceive him; that Napoleon could collect an army of a hundred thousand\r\nmen among the French prisoners of war in Germany, etc.; and he\r\nadded: \"After all, why should I treat with you? Why should I give\r\nyour irregular Republic an appearance of legality by signing an\r\narmistice with its representative? What are you but rebels? Your\r\nemperor if he came back would have the right to shoot every one\r\nof you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if he came back,\" cried Jules Favre, \"all would be civil war\r\nand anarchy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you so sure of that?\" said the chancellor. \"Anyhow, a civil\r\nwar in France could not affect Germany.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, M. le Comte, are you not afraid of reducing us to despair,\r\nof exasperating our resistance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your resistance!\" cried Bismarck. \"Are you proud of your resistance?\r\nIf General Trochu were a German, I would have him shot this evening.\r\nYou have no right, for the sake of mere military vainglory, to\r\nrisk the lives of two millions of people. The railroad tracks have\r\nbeen torn up, and if we cannot lay them down again in two days, we\r\nknow that a hundred thousand people in Paris will die of famine.\r\nDon't talk of resistance, it is criminal.\"\r\n\r\nJules Favre, put entirely out of countenance by Bismarck's tone,\r\nmerely insisted that in pity to France there should be no question\r\nof subjecting her to the ignominy of being again made over to her\r\ndeposed emperor. Before parting, Bismarck requested him to write\r\ndown such conditions of peace as seemed to him reasonable, in order\r\nthat they might discuss them the next day.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: My copy of d'Hérisson's book has a pencil note at\r\nthis place, written by a friend then at Versailles: \"Bismarck rode\r\nafter Jules Favre when he set out on his return, and thrust into\r\nhis carriage an enormous sausage.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen that day came, the chancellor, having had interviews with\r\nhis sovereign and Von Moltke, submitted his own propositions. They\r\nwere seven in number:--\r\n\r\nI. An armistice for twenty-one days.\r\n\r\nII. Disarmament of the French army, to remain in Paris as prisoners\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nIII. The soldiers to give up arms and banners; officers to keep\r\ntheir swords.\r\n\r\nIV. The armistice to extend all over France.\r\n\r\nV. Paris to pay indemnity, and give up its forts to the Prussians.\r\n\r\nVI. The Germans not to enter Paris during the armistice.\r\n\r\nVII. Elections to be held throughout France for a National Assembly\r\ncharged to consider conditions of peace.\r\n\r\nSome slight modifications were made in these hard terms, which were\r\nsigned Jan. 28, 1871.\r\n\r\nAs aide-de-camp and secretary to the French minister, d'Hérisson\r\nwas present at all the interviews between Bismarck and his principal.\r\nWhen the terms, proposed by Germany were reported by Jules Favre\r\nto the Committee of Defence, they were thought less severe than\r\nhad been feared.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Favre and d'Hérisson were at Versailles by dawn.\r\nBismarck, who was an early riser, soon appeared, and took the minister\r\nand his aide-de-camp to his study. There the two men talked, and\r\nthe secretary took notes of the conversation.\r\n\r\nBismarck and Favre presented a great contrast. Bismarck was then\r\nfifty-five years of age; Jules Favre was six years older. Bismarck\r\nwore the uniform of a colonel of White Cuirassiers,--a white coat,\r\na white cap, and yellow trimmings. He seemed like a colossus, with\r\nhis square shoulders and his mighty strength. Jules Favre, on the\r\ncontrary, was tall and thin, bowed down by a sense of his position,\r\nwearing a black frock-coat that had become too wide for him, with\r\nhis white hair resting on its collar. He was especially urgent that\r\nthe National Guard in Paris should retain its arms. He consented\r\nto the disarmament of the Mobiles and the army, but he said it would\r\nbe impossible to disarm the National Guard. At length Bismarck\r\nyielded this point, but with superior sagacity remarked: \"So be\r\nit. But believe me you are doing a foolish thing. Sooner or later\r\nyou will be sorry you did not disarm those unquiet spirits. Their\r\narms will be turned against you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the question was raised concerning the indemnity to be paid\r\nby Paris, Bismarck said, laughing, that Paris was so great a lady,\r\nit would be an indignity to ask of her less than a milliard of\r\nfrancs ($200,000,000). The ransom was finally settled at two hundred\r\nmillions of francs ($40,000,000).\r\n\r\n\"The dinner-hour having arrived, the chancellor invited us,\" says\r\nd'Hérisson, \"to take seats at his table. Jules Favre, who wanted\r\nto write out carefully the notes I had taken, begged to have his\r\ndinner sent up to him; so I alone followed the chancellor to the\r\ndining-room, where about a dozen military and civil functionaries\r\nwere assembled, but all were in uniform. The chancellor, who sat\r\nat the head of the table, placed me on his right. There was plenty\r\nof massive silver, belonging evidently to a travelling case. The\r\nonly deficiency was in light, the table being illuminated by only\r\ntwo wax candles stuck in empty wine-bottles. This was the only\r\nevidence of a time of war.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the chancellor was seated, he began to eat with a good\r\nappetite, talking all the time, and drinking alternately beer and\r\nchampagne from a great silver goblet marked with his initials. The\r\nconversation was in French. Suddenly the chancellor remembered\r\nhaving met M. d'Hérisson eight years before at the Princess\r\nMentzichoff's, and their relations became those of two gentlemen\r\nwho recognize each other in good society.\r\n\r\nThe Parisians thought that d'Hérisson had been far too lively on\r\nthis occasion; but he feels sure that his sprightly talk and free\r\nparticipation in the good things of the table, formed a favorable\r\ncontrast to the deep depression of Jules Favre at the same board\r\nthe day before. \"M. de Bismarck,\" he says, \"is not at all like\r\nthe conventional statesman. He is not solemn. He is very gay, and\r\neven when discussing the gravest questions often makes jokes, though\r\nunder his playful sallies gleam the lion's claws.\"\r\n\r\nThey talked of hunting. The chancellor related anecdotes of his\r\nown prowess, and by the time they returned to Jules Favre, the\r\nFrench aide-de-camp and the Prussian prime minister were on the\r\nbest terms with each other. But before long the chancellor gave a\r\nspecimen of the violence of his displeasure. \"Three times,\" says\r\nd'Hérisson, \"I saw him angry,--once _à propos_ of Garibaldi; once\r\nwhen speaking of the resistance of St. Quentin, an unwalled town,\r\nwhich he said should have submitted at once; and once it was my\r\nown fault.\"\r\n\r\nOn the table stood a saucer with three choice cigars. The chancellor\r\ntook it up and offered it to Jules Favre, who replied that he never\r\nsmoked; \"There you are wrong,\" said Bismarck; \"when a conversation\r\nis about to take place which may lead to differences of opinion,\r\nit is better to smoke. The cigar between a man's lips, which he\r\nmust not let fall, controls his physical impatience. It soothes him\r\nimperceptibly. He grows more conciliatory. He is more disposed to\r\nmake concessions. And diplomacy is made up of reciprocal concessions.\r\nYou who don't smoke have one advantage over me,--you are more on\r\nthe alert. But I have an advantage over you,--you will be more\r\nlikely than I shall be to lose your self control and give way to\r\nsudden impressions.\"\r\n\r\nThe negotiation was resumed very quietly. With astonishing frankness\r\nthe chancellor said simply and plainly what he wanted. He went straight\r\nto his point, bewildering Jules Favre, a lawyer by profession, who\r\nwas accustomed to diplomatic circumlocutions, and was not prepared\r\nfor such imperious openness.\r\n\r\nThe chancellor spoke French admirably, \"making use,\" says d'Hérisson\r\n\"of strong and choice expressions, and never seeming at a loss\r\nfor a word.\" But when the subject of Garibaldi and his army came\r\nup, his eyes began to flash, and he seemed to curb himself with\r\ndifficulty. \"I intend,\" he said, \"to leave him and his followers\r\nout of the armistice. He is not one of your own people. You can\r\nvery well leave him to me. Our army opposed to him is about equal\r\nto his. Let them fight it out between them.\" Jules Favre replied\r\nthat this was impossible; for though France had not asked Garibaldi\r\nfor his services, and had in the first instance refused them,\r\ncircumstances had made him general-in-chief of a large _corps d'armée_\r\ncomposed almost entirely of Frenchmen, and to abandon him would be\r\nindefensible. Then the anger of the chancellor blazed forth against\r\nGaribaldi. \"I want to parade him through the streets of Berlin,\"\r\nhe cried, \"with a placard on his back: 'This is Gratitude!'\"\r\n\r\nHere d'Hérisson interrupted his burst of anger by picking up the\r\nsaucer from the table and holding it to his breast as beggars do\r\nat the church-doors. The chancellor caught his idea after a moment.\r\nHe laughed, and Garibaldi, with his _corps d'armée_, was included\r\nin the armistice.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, however, that a French general should come out\r\nto Versailles the next day and confer with Count von Moltke with\r\nregard to some military details. The old general who was chosen\r\nfor that service was furious at the appointment, and behaved with\r\nsuch rudeness that Bismarck requested that a man more courteous\r\nmight replace him.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the conversation Bismarck, who was always breaking\r\noff upon side topics, replied to an observation made by Jules Favre\r\nabout the love of France for a republic, by saying: \"Are you so\r\nsure of that?--for I don't think so. Before treating with you, we\r\nnaturally made it our business to obtain good information as to\r\nthe state of public feeling in your country; and notwithstanding\r\nthis unhappy war, which was forced by France upon Napoleon III.,\r\nand notwithstanding the disasters of your armies, nothing would be\r\neasier, believe me, than to re-establish the emperor. I will not\r\nsay that his restoration would have been hailed by acclamations\r\nin Paris, but it would have been submitted to by the country. A\r\n_plébiscite_ would have done the rest.\"\r\n\r\nJules Favre protested. \"Oh, you will become more inclined to monarchy\r\nas you grow older,\" cried the chancellor. \"Look at me. I began\r\nmy public life by being a liberal; and now, by force of reason,\r\nby the teachings of experience, and by an increased knowledge of\r\nmankind, I have learned, loving my country, wishing her good and her\r\ngreatness, to become a conservative,--an upholder of authority. My\r\nemperor converted me. My gratitude to him, my respectful affection,\r\ndate from the far-off time when he alone supported me. If I am to-day\r\nthe man you see me, if I have rendered any service to my country, I\r\nowe it all, as I am pleased to acknowledge, to the emperor.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, as Jules Favre was returning to Paris to obtain from\r\nhis colleagues the ratification of the armistice, Bismarck proposed\r\nthat firing should cease at midnight. Jules Favre assented, but\r\nasked as a courtesy that Paris might fire the last shot.\r\n\r\nThat night the terms of capitulation were signed by all the members\r\nof the Committee of Defence. It is strange how the baptismal name\r\nof Jules predominated among them,--Jules Favre, Jules Ferry, Jules\r\nSimon, Jules Trochu. Trochu, however, did not sign, having resigned\r\nhis post that he might not be called upon to do so.\r\n\r\nA few changes in the articles as at first drawn up were made. The\r\nPrussians did not insist, as Bismarck had done at first, that the\r\ncannon in the bastions should be hurled down, and regiments were\r\npermitted to retain their colors, though Von Moltke objected strongly\r\nto such concessions. They were granted, however, by the emperor,\r\nwhen the matter was referred to him, but in words more insulting\r\nthan a refusal. \"Tell the envoy of the French Government,\" he said,\r\n\"that we have trophies enough and standards enough taken from French\r\narmies, and have no need of those of the army of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nThen, the capitulation being signed, the armistice began. General\r\nelections were at once held all over France, and the National Assembly\r\nmet at Bordeaux. A Provisional Government, with M. Thiers at its\r\nhead, was appointed, and peace was concluded. Alsace and Lorraine\r\nwere given up to Germany, with the exception of the stronghold\r\nof Belfort, which had never surrendered. The German army was to\r\nenter Paris, but to go no farther than the Place de la Concorde;\r\nand besides the two hundred millions of francs exacted from Paris,\r\nFrance was to pay five milliards, that is, five thousand millions,\r\nof francs, as a war indemnity,--a thousand millions of dollars.\r\nGermany was to retain certain forts in France, and her troops in\r\nthem were to be rationed by the French until this money was paid.\r\n\r\nIt was paid in an incredibly short time, chiefly by the help of the\r\ngreat Jewish banking-houses; and the last of the Germans retired\r\nto their own soil in September, 1872.\r\n\r\nBut on March 13, 1871, the German army around Paris, after remaining\r\na few hours in the capital, marched away towards home.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly at Bordeaux proceeded at once to transfer itself to\r\nthe late Prussian headquarters at Versailles; but on March 18 a\r\ngreat rising, called the Commune, broke out in Paris, which lasted\r\nrather more than nine weeks, with a continued succession of horrors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNE.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Commune is piteous, disheartening, shameful, and\r\nterrible. It seems as if during three months of 1871 \"human nature,\"\r\nas Carlyle says of it in his \"French Revolution,\" \"had thrown off\r\nall formulas, and come out _human!_\" It is the story of those whom\r\nthe French call \"the people,\"--we \"the mob,\" or \"the populace,\"--let\r\nloose upon society, and society in its turn mercilessly avenging\r\nitself for its wrongs.\r\n\r\nBy March 12,1871, the Prussian soldiers had quitted the environs of\r\nParis, and were in full march for their homes. Two of the detached\r\nforts, however, remained eighteen months longer in their hands.\r\nOn March 20 the National Assembly was to begin its session at\r\nVersailles. The Provinces were very mistrustful of Paris, and the\r\nassembling of the deputies at Versailles was of itself a proof\r\nof the want of national confidence in the Parisians.\r\n\r\nWhen it was made known that the German army was to enter Paris,\r\nthe National Guard of Belleville and Montmartre stole cannon from\r\nthe fortifications, and placed them in position in their own quarter\r\non the heights, so that they could fire into the city.\r\n\r\nOn March 18 General Vinoy, who had succeeded Trochu as military\r\ncommander of Paris, demanded that these cannon should be given back\r\nto the city. Many of them had been purchased by subscription during\r\nthe siege, but they were not the property of the men of Belleville\r\nand Montmartre, but of the whole National Guard. A regiment of\r\nthe line was ordered to take possession of them, and they did so.\r\nBut immediately after, the soldiers fraternized with the National\r\nGuard of Belleville, and surrendered their prize. An officer of\r\nchasseurs had been killed, and General Lecomte twice ordered his\r\nmen to fire on the insurgents.[1] They refused to obey him. \"General\r\nLecomte is right,\" said a gentleman who was standing in a crowd\r\nof angry men at a street-corner near the scene of action. He was\r\nseized at once, and was soon recognized as General Clément Thomas,\r\nformerly commander of the National Guard of Paris. He had done gallant\r\nservice during the siege; but that consideration had no weight with\r\nthe insurgents. General Lecomte had been already arrested. \"We\r\nwill put you with him,\" cried the mob,--\"you, who dare to speak\r\nin defence of such a scoundrel.\" Both the unfortunate generals\r\nwere immediately imprisoned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Leighton, Paris under the Commune.]\r\n\r\nAt four P. M. they were brought forth by about one hundred insurgent\r\nNational Guards; Lecomte's hands were tied, those of General Thomas\r\nwere free. They were marched to an empty house, where a mock trial\r\ntook place. No rescue was attempted, though soldiers of the line\r\nstood by. The two prisoners were then conducted to a walled enclosure\r\nat the end of the street. As soon as the party halted, an officer\r\nof the National Guard seized General Thomas by the collar and shook\r\nhim violently, holding a revolver to his head, and crying out,\r\n\"Confess that you have betrayed the Republic!\" The general shrugged\r\nhis shoulders. The officer retired. The report of twenty muskets\r\nrent the air, and General Thomas fell, face downward. They ordered\r\nLecomte to step over his body, and to take his place against the\r\nwall. Another report succeeded, and the butchery was over.\r\n\r\nBy evening the National Guard had taken possession of the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville, and the outer Boulevards were crowded by men shouting\r\nthat they had made a revolution. On this day the insurgents assumed the\r\nname of \"Fédérés,\" or Federals, denoting their project of converting\r\nthe communistic cities of France into a Federal Republic.\r\n\r\nIn vain the Government put forth proclamations calling on all good\r\ncitizens, and on the Old National Guard, to put down insurrection\r\nand maintain order and the Republic. The Old Battalions of the\r\nNational Guard, about twenty thousand strong, had been composed\r\nchiefly of tradesmen and gentlemen; these, as soon as the siege was\r\nover, had for the most part left the city. Bismarck's proposition\r\nto Jules Favre had been to leave the Old National Guard its arms,\r\nthat it might preserve order, but to take advantage of the occasion\r\nto disarm the New Battalions. As we have seen, all were permitted\r\nto retain their arms; but the chancellor told Jules Favre he would\r\nlive to repent having obtained the concession.\r\n\r\nThe friends of order, in spite of the Government's proclamations,\r\ncould with difficulty be roused to action. There were two parties\r\nin Paris,--the Passives, and the Actives; and the latter party\r\nincreased in strength from day to day. Indeed, it was hard for\r\npeaceful citizens to know under whom they were to range themselves.\r\nThe Government had left the city. One or two of its members were\r\nstill in Paris, but the rest had rushed off to Versailles, protected\r\nby an army forty thousand strong, under General Vinoy.\r\n\r\nA species of Government had, however, formed itself by the morning\r\nof March 19 at the Hôtel-de-Ville. It called itself the Central\r\nCommittee of the National Guard, and issued proclamations on _white_\r\npaper (white paper being reserved in Paris for proclamations of the\r\nGovernment). It called upon all citizens in their sections at once\r\nto elect a commune. This proclamation was signed by twenty citizens,\r\nonly one of whom, M. Assy, had ever been heard of in Paris. Some\r\nmonths before, he had headed a strike, killed a policeman, and had\r\nbeen condemned to the galleys for murder. The men who thus constituted\r\nthemselves a Government, were all members of the International,--that\r\nsecret association, formed in all countries, for the abolition of\r\nproperty and patriotism, religion and the family, rulers, armies,\r\nupper classes, and every species of refinement. Another proclamation\r\ndecreed that the people of Paris, whether it pleased them or not,\r\nmust on Wednesday, March 22, elect a commune.\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter I have tried to explain the nature of a commune.\r\nVictor Hugo wrote his opinion of it, when the idea of a commune\r\nwas first started, after the fall of Louis Philippe in 1848. His\r\nwords read like a prophecy:--\r\n\r\n\"It would tear down the tricolor, and set up the red flag of\r\ndestruction; it would make penny-pieces out of the Column of the\r\nPlace Vendôme; it would hurl down the statue of Napoleon, and set\r\nup that of Marat in its place; it would suppress the Académie,\r\nthe École Polytechnique, and the Legion of Honor. To the grand\r\nmotto of 'Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity,' it would add the\r\nwords, 'or death.' It would bring about a general bankruptcy. It\r\nwould ruin the rich without enriching the poor. It would destroy\r\nlabor, which gives each of us his bread. It would abolish property,\r\nand break up the family. It would march about with the heads of the\r\nproscribed on pikes, fill the prisons with the suspected, and empty\r\nthem by massacre. It would convert France into a country of gloom. It\r\nwould destroy liberty, stifle the arts, silence thought, and deny\r\nGod. It would supply work for two things fatal to prosperity,--the\r\npress that prints assignats, and the guillotine. In a word, it\r\nwould do in cold blood what the men of 1793 did in the ravings\r\nof fever; and after the great horrors which our fathers saw, we\r\nshould have the horrible in every form that is low and base.\"\r\n\r\nThe party of the Commune has been divided into three classes,--the\r\nrascals, the dupes, and the enthusiasts. The latter in the last\r\nhours of the Commune (which lasted seventy-three days) put forth\r\nin a manifesto their theory of government; to wit, that every city\r\nin France should have absolute power to govern itself, should levy\r\nits own taxes, make its own laws, provide its own soldiers, see to\r\nits own schools, elect its own judges, and make within its corporate\r\nlimits whatever changes of government it pleased. These Communistic\r\ncities were to be federated into a Republic. It was not clear how\r\nthose Frenchmen were to be governed who did not live in cities;\r\npossibly each city was to have territory attached to it, as in\r\nItaly in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe weather during March of the year 1871 was very fine, and fine\r\nweather is always favorable to disturbances and revolutions.\r\n\r\nThe very few men of note still left in Paris desirous of putting\r\nan end to disorder without the shedding of blood, proposed to go\r\nout to Versailles and negotiate with M. Thiers, the provisional\r\npresident, and the members of his Government. They were the twelve\r\ndeputies of the Department of the Seine, in which Paris is situated,\r\nheaded by Louis Blanc, and the _maires_, with their assistants, from\r\nthe twenty arrondissements. They proposed to urge on the Government\r\nof Versailles the policy of giving the Parisians the right to elect\r\nwhat in England would be called a Lord Mayor, and likewise a city\r\ncouncil; also to give the National Guard the right to elect its\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThis deputation went out to Versailles on the 20th of March,--two\r\ndays before the proposed election for members of a commune. On the\r\n21st, while all Paris was awaiting anxiously the outcome of the\r\nmission, there was a great \"order\" demonstration in the streets,\r\nand hopes of peace and concord were exchanged on all sides. The\r\nnext day, the order demonstration, which had seemed so popular,\r\nwas repeated, when a massacre took place on the Place Vendome and\r\nthe Rue de la Paix. Nurses, children, and other quiet spectators\r\nwere killed, as also old gentlemen and reporters for the newspapers.\r\nOne of the victims was a partner in the great banking house of\r\nHottinguer, well known to American travellers.\r\n\r\nThe most popular man at that moment in Paris seemed to be Admiral\r\nSeisset, who had commanded the brigade of sailors which did good\r\nservice in the siege. He went out to Versailles to unite his efforts\r\nto those of the _maires_ and the deputies in favor of giving Paris\r\nmunicipal rights; but M. Thiers and his ministers were firm in\r\ntheir refusal.\r\n\r\nWhen this was known in Paris, great was the fury and indignation\r\nof the people. In vain had Louis Blanc entreated the Assembly at\r\nVersailles to approve conciliatory measures; and when that body\r\nutterly refused to make terms with a Parisian mob, M. Clémenceau\r\nsaid, as he quitted their chamber: \"May the responsibility for\r\nwhat may happen, rest upon your heads.\"\r\n\r\nThe mission to Versailles having been productive of no results,\r\nthe election for a commune was held. The extremest men were chosen\r\nin every quarter of the city, and formed what was called the Council\r\nof the Commune. It held its sittings in the Hôtel-de-Ville, and\r\nconsisted at first of eighty members, seventy of whom had never\r\nbeen heard of in Paris before. Its numbers dwindled rapidly, from\r\nvarious causes, especially in the latter days of the Commune. Among\r\nthem were Poles, Italians, and even Germans; two of the eighty\r\nclaimed to be Americans.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the Council of the Commune was to take possession\r\nof the Hôtel-de-Ville and to celebrate the inauguration of the\r\nnew government by a brilliant banquet; its first decree was that\r\nno tenant need pay any back rent from October, 1870, to April,\r\n1871,--the time during which the siege had lasted. It lost no time\r\nin inviting Garibaldi to assume the command of the National Guard.\r\nThis Garibaldi declined at once, saying that a commandant of the\r\nNational Guard, a commander-in-chief of Paris, and an executive\r\ncommittee could not act together. \"What Paris needs,\" he said,\r\n\"is an honest dictator, who will choose honest men to act under\r\nhim. If you should have the good fortune to find a Washington,\r\nFrance will recover from shipwreck, and in a short time be grander\r\nthan ever.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 3 the civil war broke out,--Paris against Versailles;\r\nthe army under the National Assembly against the National Guard\r\nunder the Commune. The Prussians from the two forts which they\r\nstill held, looked grimly on.\r\n\r\nAt the bridge of Courbevoie, near Neuilly, where the body of Napoleon\r\nhad been landed thirty years before, a flag of truce was met by\r\ntwo National Guards. Its bearer was a distinguished surgeon, Dr.\r\nPasquier. After a brief parley, one of the National Guards blew\r\nout the doctor's brains. When news of this outrage was brought to\r\nGeneral Vinoy, he commanded the guns of Fort Valérien to be turned\r\nupon the city.\r\n\r\nAt five A. M. the next morning five columns of Federals marched out\r\nto take the fort. They were under the command of three generals,\r\nBergeret, Duval, and Eudes. With Bergeret rode Lullier, who had\r\nbeen a naval officer, and Flourens, the popular favorite among\r\nthe members of the Commune. The three divisions marched in full\r\nconfidence that the soldiers under Vinoy would fraternize with them.\r\nThey were wholly mistaken; the guns of Fort Valérien crashed into\r\nthe midst of their columns, and almost at the same time Flourens,\r\nin a hand-to-hand struggle, was slain.\r\n\r\nFlourens had begun life with every prospect of being a distinguished\r\nscientist. His father had been perpetual secretary of the Academy\r\nof Sciences and a professor in the Collège de France, in which\r\nhis son succeeded him when he was barely twenty-one. His first\r\nlecture, on the \"History of Man,\" created a great impression; but\r\nin 1864 he resigned his professorship, and thenceforward devoted\r\nall his energies to the cause of the oppressed. In Crete he fought\r\nagainst the Turks. He was always conspiring when at home in Paris;\r\neven when the Prussians were at its gates, he could not refrain.\r\nHe was the darling of the Belleville population, whom in times of\r\ndistress and trial he fed, clothed, and comforted. Sometimes he\r\nwas in prison, sometimes in exile. \"He was a madman, but a hero,\r\nand towards the poor and the afflicted as gentle as a sister of\r\ncharity,\" said one who knew him.\r\n\r\nOf the three generals who led the attack on Mont Valérien, Duval\r\nwas captured and shot; Eudes and Bergeret got back to Paris in\r\nsafety. But the latter, in company with Lullier, was at once sent\r\nto prison by the Central Committee, and a decree was issued that\r\nParis should be covered with barricades. As the insurgents had\r\nplenty of leisure, these barricades were strong and symmetrical,\r\nthough many of them were injudiciously placed.\r\n\r\nWhilst the fight of the 4th of April was going on without the gates,\r\nthe Central Committee was occupied in issuing decrees, by which\r\nThiers, Favre, Simon,--in short, all the legitimate ministers,--were\r\nsummoned to give themselves up to the Commune to be tried for their\r\noffences, or else all their property in Paris would be confiscated\r\nor destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the expedition under Bergeret made the Parisians\r\nfuriously angry. In less than a week some of the best-known priests\r\nin Paris were arrested as hostages. The churches were all closed\r\nafter the morning services on Easter Day; the arms were cut off\r\nfrom the crosses, and red flags were hung up in their stead. No\r\none could be buried with Christian decency, or married with the\r\nChurch's blessing.\r\n\r\n\"The motto of the Commune soon became fraternity of that sort,\"\r\nsaid a resident in Paris, \"which means arrest each other.\" Before\r\nthe Commune had been established two weeks, many of its leading\r\nmembers, besides Lullier and Bergeret, had found their way to prison.\r\n\r\nA personage who rose to great importance at this period was General\r\nCluseret. He called himself an American, but he had had many aliases,\r\nand it is not known in what country he was born. At one time he\r\nhad been a captain in the Chasseurs d'Afrique, but was convicted\r\nof dishonesty in the purchase of horses, and dismissed from the\r\narmy. Then he came to the United States, and entered the service\r\nof the Union, by which he became a naturalized citizen. He got\r\ninto trouble, however, over a flock of sheep which mysteriously\r\ndisappeared while he had charge of them. Next he enlisted in the\r\nPapal Zouaves. After the Commune he escaped from Paris, and the\r\nFenians chose him for their general. In their service he came very\r\nnear capturing Chester Castle. The Fenians, however, soon accused\r\nhim of being a traitor. Again he escaped, fearing a secret dagger,\r\nand was thought to have found refuge in a religious community.\r\nSubsequently he served the Turks; and lastly, during the presidency\r\nof M. Grévy, at a time of great dissatisfaction in France, he was\r\nelected a deputy from one of the Southern cities.\r\n\r\nBy April 7, Cluseret had, as some one expresses it, \"swallowed up\r\nthe Commune.\" He became for three weeks absolute dictator; after\r\nwhich time he found himself in prison at Mazas, occupying the very\r\ncell to which he had sent Bergeret.\r\n\r\nCluseret was a soldier of experience; but Bergeret had been a\r\nbookseller's assistant, and his highest military rank had been\r\nthat of a sergeant in the National Guard. He could not ride on\r\nhorseback, and he drove out from Paris to the fight in which Flourens\r\nwas killed.\r\n\r\nThe official title of Cluseret and others, who were heads of the\r\nWar Office during the Commune, was War Delegate, the committee\r\nrefusing to recognize the usual title of Minister of War.\r\n\r\nProbably the best general the Commune had was a Pole named Dombrowski,\r\nan adventurer who came into France with Garibaldi. He was not only\r\na good strategist, but a dare-devil for intrepidity. Some said he\r\nhad fought for Polish liberty, others, that he had fought against\r\nit; at any rate, he was an advanced Anarchist, though in military\r\nmatters he was a strict disciplinarian, and kept his men of all\r\nnations in better order than any other commander.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the first attack of the Communist forces on those of\r\nthe Versailles Government, the guns of Fort Valérien opened on\r\nParis, the second bombardment began. It was far more destructive\r\nthan that of the Prussians, the guns from the forts being so much\r\nnearer to the centre of the city. The shells of the Versaillais\r\nfell on friend and foe alike, on women and on children, on homes,\r\non churches, and on public buildings. Three shots struck the Arch\r\nof Triumph, which the Prussians had spared.\r\n\r\nSuch scenes as the following one, related by an American, might\r\nbe seen daily:--\r\n\r\n\"Two National Guards passed me, bearing a litter between them. 'Oh,\r\nyou can look if you like,' cried one; so I drew back the checked\r\ncurtain. On a mattress was stretched a woman decently dressed,\r\nwith a child of two or three years lying on her breast. They both\r\nlooked very pale. One of the woman's arms was hanging down; her\r\nhand had been carried away. 'Where are they wounded?' I asked.\r\n'Wounded! they are dead,' was the reply. 'They are the wife and\r\nchild of the velocipede-maker in the Avenue de Wagram. If you will\r\ngo and break the news to him, you will do us a kindness.'\"\r\n\r\nThe velocipede-maker may have been--probably was--a good, peaceable\r\ncitizen, with no sympathy for disorder or anarchy; but doubtless\r\nfrom the moment that news was broken to him, he became a furious\r\nCommunist.\r\n\r\nBy order of General Cluseret every man in Paris was to be forced\r\nto bear arms for the Commune. His neighbors were expected to see\r\nthat he did so, and to arrest him at once if he seemed anxious\r\nto decline. \"Thus, every man walking along the street was liable\r\nto have the first Federal who passed him, seize him by the collar\r\nand say: 'Come along, and be killed on behalf of my municipal\r\nindependence.'\"\r\n\r\nIt would be hardly possible to follow the details of the fighting,\r\nthe arrests, the bombardment, or even the changes that took place\r\namong those high in office in the Council of the Commune during the\r\nseventy-three days that its power lasted; the state of things in\r\nParis will be best exhibited by detached sketches of what individuals\r\nsaw and experienced during those dreadful days.\r\n\r\nHere is the narrative of an English lady who was compelled to visit\r\nParis on Easter Sunday, April 9, while it was under the administration\r\nof Cluseret.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A Catholic lady in \"Red\" Paris. London Spectator, April,\r\n1871 (Living Age, May 13, 1871).]\r\n\r\nThe streets she found for the most part silent and empty. There were\r\na few omnibuses, filled with National Guards and men _en blouse_,\r\nand heavy ammunition-wagons under the disorderly escort of men in\r\nmotley uniforms, with guns and bayonets. Here and there were groups\r\nof \"patriots\" seated on the curbstones, playing pitch-farthing,\r\nknown in France by the name of \"bouchon.\" Their guns were resting\r\nquietly against the wall behind them, with, in many instances, a\r\nloaf of bread stuck on the bayonet. The sky was gray, the wind\r\npiercingly cold. The swarming life of Paris was hushed. There was\r\nno movement, and scarcely any sound. The shop-windows were shut,\r\nmany were boarded up; from a few hung shabby red flags, but the\r\nvery buildings looked dead. She says,--\r\n\r\n\"I felt bewildered. I could see no traces of the siege, and all\r\nmy previous ideas of a revolution were dispersed. I passed several\r\nchurches, not then closed, and being a Catholic, I entered the\r\nMadeleine. The precious articles on the altar had been removed by\r\nthe priests, but except the words 'Liberté,' 'Égalité,' 'Fraternité,'\r\ndeeply cut in the stone over the great door, the church had not,\r\nso far, been desecrated. I went also to mass at Notre Dame des\r\nVictoires; but before telling my cabman to drive me there, I hesitated,\r\nbelieving it to be in a bad part of the city. 'There are no bad\r\nparts,' he said, 'except towards the Arch of Triumph and Neuilly.\r\nThe rest of Paris is as quiet as a bird's nest.' The church was\r\nvery full of men as well as women. It was a solemn, devout crowd;\r\nevery woman wore a plain black dress, every face was anxious, grave,\r\nand grieved, but none looked frightened. As the aged priest who\r\nofficiated read the first words of the Gospel for the day, 'Be\r\nnot afraid, ye seek Jesus who was crucified,' the bombardment\r\nrecommenced with a fearful roar, shaking the heavy leathern curtain\r\nover the church door, and rattling the glass in the great painted\r\nwindows. I started, but got used to it after a while, and paid\r\nno more attention to it than did others. While I was in church,\r\nthe citizen patriot who was my cab-driver, had brought me three\r\nnewspapers, one of them the journal edited by M. Rochefort, which\r\nsaid that it was earnestly to be hoped that the 'old assassin'\r\nM. Thiers would soon be disposed of; that all men of heart were\r\nearnestly demanding more blood, and that blood must be given them.\r\nI also learned that the Commune would erect a statue to Robespierre\r\nout of the statues of kings, which were to be melted down for that\r\npurpose. In the Rue Saint-Honore I met a lady whom I knew, returning\r\nfrom the flower-market with flowers in her hands. 'Then no one,'\r\nI said, pointing to these blossoms, 'need be afraid in Paris?'\r\n'No woman,' she answered, 'except of shells; but the men are all\r\nafraid, and in danger. They are suspected of wanting to get away,\r\nbut they will be made to stay and to fight for the Commune.'\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, profound gravity seemed expressed on all men's faces,\r\nand as a body, the patriots looked to me cold, tired, bored, and\r\nhungry, to say nothing of dirty, which they looked, to a man. I\r\nhad expressed a wish to see a barricade, so we turned into a small\r\nstreet apparently closed in by a neatly built wall with holes in\r\nit, through which I saw the mouths of cannon. About this wall men\r\nwere swarming both in and out of uniform. They were all armed,\r\nand two or three were members of the Commune, with red sashes and\r\npistols stuck in them, after the fashion of the theatre. As I looked\r\nout of my cab window, longing to see more, a cheerful young woman,\r\nwith a pretty, wan infant in her arms, encouraged me to alight,\r\nand a young man to whom she was talking, a clean, trim, fair young\r\nfellow, with a military look, stepped forward and saluted me. He\r\nseemed pleased at my admiration of the barricade, and having handed\r\na tin can to the young woman, invited me to come inside. Thence I\r\nbeheld the Place Vendôme. I had seen it last on Aug. 15, 1868, on\r\nthe emperor's fête-day, filled with the glittering Imperial troops.\r\nI saw it again, a wide, empty waste, bounded by four symmetrical\r\nbarricades, dotted with slouching figures whose clothes and arms\r\nseemed to encumber them.... I thanked my friend for his politeness,\r\nand returned to my carriage. The young woman smiled at me, as much\r\nas to say: 'Is he not a fine fellow?' I thought he was; and there\r\nmay be other fine fellows as much out of place in the ruffianly\r\nmass with which they are associated.\r\n\r\n\"In the Rue de Rivoli I saw a regiment marching out to engage the\r\nenemy. Among them were some villanous-looking faces. They passed with\r\nlittle tramp and a good deal of shuffle,--shabby, wretched, silent.\r\nI did not hear a laugh or an oath; I did not see a violent gesture,\r\nand hardly a smile, that day. The roistering, roaring, terrible\r\n'Reds,' as I saw them, were weary, dull men, doing ill-directed\r\nwork with plodding indifference.\r\n\r\n\"I visited a lady of world-wide reputation, who gave me a history\r\nof the past months in Paris so brilliantly and epigrammatically that\r\nI was infinitely amused, and carried away the drollest impressions\r\nof L'Empire Cluseret; but her manner changed when I asked her what\r\nI should say to her friends in England. 'Tell them,' she said,\r\n'to fear everything, and to hope very little. We are a degraded\r\npeople; we deserve what we have got.'\r\n\r\n\"In the street I bought some daffodils from a woman who was tying\r\nthem up in bunches. As she put them into my hand, her face seemed\r\nfull of horror. Seeing probably an answering sympathy in my face,\r\nshe whispered: 'It is said that they have shot the archbishop.'\r\nI did not believe it, and I was right. He was arrested, but his\r\ndoom was delayed for six weeks. That night the churches were all\r\nclosed. There were no evening services that Easter day.\r\n\r\n\"I may add that I saw but one _bonnet rouge_, which I had supposed\r\nwould be the revolutionary headdress. It was worn by an ill-looking\r\nruffian, who sat with his back to the Quai, his legs straddled\r\nacross the foot-walk, his drunken head fallen forward on his naked,\r\nhairy breast, a broken pipe between his knees, his doubled fists\r\nupon the stones at either side of him.\"\r\n\r\nIn the story of Louis Napoleon's abortive attempt at Boulogne to\r\nincite France against Louis Philippe's Government, we were much\r\nindebted to the narrative of Count Joseph Orsi, one of the Italians\r\nwho from his earliest days had attended on his fortunes. The same\r\ngentleman has given us an account of his own experiences during\r\nthe days of the Commune:--\r\n\r\n\"One could not help being struck by the contrasts presented at\r\nthat time in Paris itself: destruction and death raging in some\r\nquarters, cannon levelling its beautiful environs, while at the\r\nsame moment one could see its fashionable Boulevards crowded with\r\nwell-dressed people loitering and smiling as if nothing were going\r\non. The cafés, indeed, were ordered to close their doors at midnight,\r\nbut behind closed shutters went on gambling, drinking, and debauchery.\r\nAfter spending a riotous night, fast men and women considered it\r\na joke to drive out to the Arch of Triumph and see how the fight\r\nwas going on.\"\r\n\r\nThe troops at Versailles, reinforced by the prisoners of war who\r\nhad been returned from Prussia, began, by the 9th of April, to\r\nmake active assaults on such forts as were held by the Federals.\r\nConfusion and despair began to reign in the Council of the Commune.\r\nUnsuccessful in open warfare, the managing committee tried to check\r\nthe advance of the Versaillais by deeds of violence and retaliation.\r\nThey arrested numerous hostages, and the same night the palace of\r\nthe archbishop was pillaged. The prefect of police, Raoul Rigault,\r\nissued a decree that every one suspected of being a _réactionnaire_\r\n(that is, a partisan of the National Assembly) should be at once\r\narrested. The delivery of letters was suspended, gas was cut off,\r\nand with the exception of a few places where lamp-posts were supplied\r\nwith petroleum, Paris was in darkness.\r\n\r\nThe Commune also issued a decree that while all men under sixty\r\nmust enter its army, women, children, and aged men could obtain\r\npasses to leave the city at the prefecture of police for two francs\r\na head. The prefecture was besieged by persons striving to get\r\nthese passes, many of whom camped out for forty-eight hours while\r\nwaiting their turn.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this confused pressure on the prefect of police,\r\nCount Orsi took the resolution of visiting him. As a known adherent\r\nof the former dynasty and a personal friend of the late emperor, he\r\ndid not feel himself safe. He therefore took the bull by the horns,\r\nand went to call on the terrible Raoul Rigault in his stronghold.\r\nHe did not see him, however; but after struggling for three hours\r\nin the crowd of poor creatures who were waiting to pay their two\r\nfrancs and receive a passport, he was admitted to the presence of\r\nhis secretary, Ferré. Ferré was writing as his visitor was shown\r\nin, and, waving his pen, made him stand where he could see him.\r\nWhen he learned his name, he said--\r\n\r\n\"Your opinions are well known to us. We also know that you have\r\ntaken no active part against us. We fight for what we believe to\r\nbe just and fair. We do not kill for the pleasure of killing, but\r\nwe must attain our end, and we _shall_, at any cost. I recommend\r\nyou to keep quiet. As you are an Italian, you shall not be molested.\r\nHowever, I must tell you that you have taken a very bold step in\r\ncalling on me in this place. Your visit might have taken a different\r\nturn. You may go. Your frank declaration has saved you.\"\r\n\r\nOn Easter Sunday, as the English lady to whom allusion has been\r\nmade, was leaving Paris, the population in the neighborhood of\r\nthe Place de Grève was amusing itself by a public burning of the\r\nguillotine. It was brought forth and placed beneath a statue of\r\nVoltaire, where it was consumed amid wild shouts of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe Freemasons and trades unions sent deputies to Versailles to\r\nendeavor to negotiate between the contending parties. M. Thiers\r\npromised amnesty to all Communists who should lay down their arms,\r\nexcept to those concerned in the deaths of Generals Lecomte and\r\nThomas, and he was also willing to give pay to National Guards\r\ntill trade and order should be restored; but no persuasions would\r\ninduce him to confer on Paris municipal rights that were not given\r\nto other cities. On the 12th of May the Commune issued the following\r\ndecree:--\r\n\r\n\"_Whereas_, the imperial column in the Place Vendôme is a monument\r\nof barbarism, a symbol of brute force and of false glory, an\r\nencouragement to the military spirit, a denial of international\r\nrights, a permanent insult offered to the conquered by the conquerors,\r\na perpetual conspiracy against one of the great principles of the\r\nFrench Republic,--namely, Fraternity,--the Commune decrees thus:\r\nThe column of the Place Vendôme shall be destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nFour days later, this decree was carried into effect. Its execution\r\nwas intrusted to the painter Courbet, who was one of the members of\r\nthe Commune. He was a man who, up to the age of fifty, had taken\r\nno part in politics, but had been wholly devoted to art. His most\r\ncelebrated pictures are the \"Combat des Cerfs\" and the \"Dame au\r\nPerroquet.\" He was a delightful companion, beloved by artists,\r\nand a personal friend of Cluseret, who had caused his name to be\r\nput upon the list of the members of the Commune.\r\n\r\nThe column of the Place Vendôme was one hundred and thirty-five\r\nfeet high. It was on the model of Trajan's column at Rome, but\r\none twelfth larger. It was erected by Napoleon I. to celebrate\r\nthe victories of the Grand Army in the campaign of 1805. He had\r\ncaused it to be cast from cannon taken from the enemy. When erected,\r\nit was surmounted by a statue of Napoleon in his imperial robes;\r\nthis, at the Restoration, gave place to a white flag. Under Louis\r\nPhilippe, Napoleon was replaced, but in his cocked hat and his\r\n_redingote_, but Louis Napoleon restored the imperial statue.\r\n\r\n\"On May 16,\" says Count Orsi, \"a crowd collected at the barricades\r\nwhich separated the Place Vendôme from the Rue de la Paix and the\r\nRue Castiglione. To the Place Vendôme itself only a few persons\r\nhad been admitted by tickets. At the four corners of the square\r\nwere placed military bands. Ropes were fastened to the upper part\r\nof the column, and worked by capstans. The monument fell with a\r\ntremendous crash, causing everything for a few moments to disappear\r\nin a blinding cloud of dust. To complete the disgrace of this savage\r\nact, the Commune advertised for tenders for the purchase of the\r\ncolumn, which was to be sold in four separate lots. This injudicious\r\nand anti-national measure inspired the regular army at Versailles\r\nwith a spirit of revenge, which led them on entering Paris to lose\r\nall self-possession, so that they dealt with the insurrection brutally\r\nand without discrimination.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be curious to trace the history of the various members\r\nof the Council of the Commune. A few have been already alluded\r\nto; but the majority came forth out of obscurity, and their fate\r\nis as obscure. Eight were professional journalists. Among these\r\nwere Rochefort, Arnould, and Vermorel. Arnould was probably the\r\nmost moderate man in the Commune, and Vermorel was one of the very\r\nfew who, when the Commune was at its last gasp, neither deserted\r\nnor disgraced it. He sprang on a barricade, crying: \"I am here, not\r\nto fight, but to die!\" and was shot down. Four were military men,\r\nof whom one was General Eudes, a draper's assistant, and one had\r\nbeen a private in the army of Africa. Five were genuine working-men,\r\nthree of whom were fierce, ignorant cobblers from Belleville; the\r\nother two were Assy, a machinist, and Thiez, a silver-chaser,--one\r\nof the few honest men in the Council. Three were not Frenchmen,\r\nalthough generals; namely, Dombrowski, La Cecilia, and Dacosta,\r\nbesides Cluseret, who claimed American citizenship. Rochefort was the\r\nson of a marquis who had been forced to write for bread. Deleschuze\r\nwas an ex-convict. Blanqui had spent two thirds of his life in\r\nprison, having been engaged from his youth up in conspiracy. He\r\nwas also at one period a Government spy. Raoul Rigault also had\r\nbeen a spy and an informer from his boyhood. Mégy and Assy were\r\nunder sentence for murder. Jourde was a medical student, one of the\r\nbest men in the Commune, and faithful to his trust as its finance\r\nminister. Flourens, the scientist, a genuine enthusiast, we have\r\nseen was killed in the first skirmish with the Versaillais. Félix\r\nPyat was an arch conspirator, but a very spirited and agreeable\r\nwriter. He was elected in 1888 a deputy under the Government of the\r\nThird Republic. Lullier had been a naval officer, but was dismissed\r\nthe service for insubordination.\r\n\r\nTo such men (the best of them wholly without experience in the\r\nart of government) were confided the destinies of Paris, and, as\r\nthey hoped, of France; but their number dwindled from time to time,\r\ntill hardly more than fifty were left around the Council Board, when\r\nabout two weeks before the downfall of the Commune twenty-two of\r\nthis remainder resigned,--some because they could not but foresee\r\nthe coming crash, others because they would no longer take part in\r\nthe violence and tyranny of their colleagues. In seven weeks the\r\nCommune had four successive heads of the War Department. General\r\nEudes was the first: his rule lasted four days. Then came Cluseret;\r\nthe Empire Cluseret lasted three weeks. Then Cluseret was imprisoned,\r\nand Rossel was in office for nine days, when he resigned. On May\r\n9 Deleschuze, the ex-convict, became head of military affairs.\r\nHe was killed two weeks later, when the Commune fell. Cluseret\r\nwas deposed April 30,--some said for ill-success, some because he\r\nwas a traitor and had communications with the enemy, but probably\r\nbecause he made himself unpopular by an order requiring his officers\r\nto put no more embroidery and gold lace on their uniforms than\r\ntheir rank entitled them to.\r\n\r\nRossel, who succeeded Cluseret, was a real soldier, who tried in\r\nvain to organize the defence and to put experienced military men\r\nin command as subordinate generals. To do this he had to choose\r\nthree out of five from men who were not Frenchmen. Dombrowski and\r\nWroblewski were Poles, and General La Cecilia was an Italian. On May\r\n9, after nine days of official life, he resigned, in the following\r\nextraordinary letter:--\r\n\r\nCITIZENS, MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNE:\r\n\r\nHaving been charged by you with the War Department, I feel myself\r\nno longer capable of bearing the responsibility of a command where\r\neveryone deliberates and nobody obeys. When it was necessary to\r\norganize the artillery, the commandant of artillery deliberated,\r\nbut nothing was done. After a month's revolution, that service\r\nis carried on by only a very small number of volunteers. On my\r\nnomination to the ministry I wanted to further the search for arms,\r\nthe requisition for horses, the pursuit of refractory citizens.\r\nI asked help of the Commune; the Commune deliberated, but passed\r\nno resolutions. Later the Central Committee came and offered its\r\nservices to the War Department. I accepted them in the most decisive\r\nmanner, and delivered up to its members all the documents I had\r\nconcerning its organization. Since then the Central Committee has\r\nbeen deliberating, and has done nothing. During this time the enemy\r\nmultiplied his audacious attacks upon Fort Issy; had I had the\r\nsmallest military force at my command, I would have punished him\r\nfor it. The garrison, badly commanded, took to flight. The officers\r\ndeliberated, and sent away from the fort Captain Dumont, an energetic\r\nman who had been ordered to command them. Still deli berating,\r\nthey evacuated the fort, after having stupidly talked of blowing\r\nit up,--as difficult a thing for them to do as to defend it....\r\nMy predecessor was wrong to remain, as he did, three weeks in such\r\nan absurd position. Enlightened by his example, and knowing that\r\nthe strength of a revolutionist consists only in the clearness of\r\nhis position, I have but two alternatives,--either to break the\r\nchains which impede my actions, or to retire. I will not break\r\nmy chains, because those chains are you and your weakness. I will\r\nnot touch the sovereignty of the people.\r\n\r\nI retire, and have the honor to beg for a cell at Mazas.\r\n\r\n  ROSSEL.\r\n\r\nHe did not obtain the cell at Mazas. He escaped from the vengeance\r\nof his colleagues, and was supposed to be in England or Switzerland,\r\nwhile in reality he had never quitted Paris. He was arrested two weeks\r\nafter the fall of the Commune, disguised as a railroad employee. He\r\nwas examined at the Luxembourg, and then taken, handcuffed, to\r\nVersailles, where he was shot at Satory, though M. Thiers, the\r\npresident, made vain efforts to save him.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Commune, who by the first week in May were reduced\r\nto fifty-three, met in the Hôtel-de-Ville in a vast room once hung\r\nwith the portraits of sovereigns. The canvas of these pictures\r\nhad been cut out, but the empty frames still hung upon the walls;\r\nwhile at one end of the chamber was a statue of the Republic dressed\r\nin red flags, and bearing the inscription, \"War to Tyrants.\"\r\n\r\nReporters were not admitted, and spectators could be brought in only\r\nby favor of some member. The members sat upon red-velvet chairs,\r\neach girt with his red scarf of office, trimmed with heavy bullion\r\nfringe. The chairs were placed round a long table, on which was\r\nstationery for the members' use, _carafes_ of water, and sugar\r\nfor _eau sucrée_. It was an awe-inspiring assembly; \"for the men\r\nwho talked, held a city of two millions of inhabitants in their\r\nhands, and were free to put into practice any or all of the amazing\r\ntheories that might come into their heads. Their speeches, however,\r\nwere brief; they were not wordy, as they might have been if reporters\r\nhad been present. Most of them wore uniforms profusely decorated\r\nwith gold lace,\" and, says an Englishman who saw them in their\r\nseats, \"one had only to look in their faces to judge the whole\r\ntruth in connection with the Commune,--its causes, its prospects,\r\nand its signification. A citizen whom I had heard of as most hotly\r\nin favor of Press freedom, proposed in my hearing that all journals\r\nin Paris should be suppressed save those that were edited by members\r\nof the Council of the Commune. That there were three or four earnest\r\nmen among them, no one can dispute; but as to the rest, I can only\r\nsay that if they were zealous patriots devoted to their country's\r\ngood, they did not, when I saw them, look like it.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cornhill Magazine, 1871.]\r\n\r\nIn the first week of May the Commune decreed the destruction of\r\nM. Thiers's beautiful home in the Rue St. Georges. The house was\r\nfilled with objects of art and with documents of historical interest\r\nwhich he had gathered while writing his History of the Revolution,\r\nthe Consulate, and the First Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Commune had removed some of these precious things, and sold\r\nthem to dealers, from whom many were afterwards recovered; but\r\nthe mob which assembled to execute the decree of destruction, was\r\neager to consume everything that was left. In the courtyard were\r\nscattered books and pictures waiting to feed the flames. \"The men\r\nbusy at the work looked,\" says an Englishman,[2] \"like demons in\r\nthe red flame. I turned away, thinking not of the man of politics,\r\nbut of the historian, of the house where he had thought and worked,\r\nof the books that he had treasured on his shelves, of the favorite\r\nchair that had been burned upon his hearthstone. I thought of all\r\nthe dumb witnesses of a long and laborious life dispersed, of all\r\nthe memories those rooms contained destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Leighton, Paris under the Commune.]\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of May, the day of the destruction of the column in the\r\nPlace Vendôme, a great patriotic concert was given in the palace\r\nof the Tuileries, which was thronged; but \"by that date, discord and\r\ndespair were in the Council of the Commune, and its most respectable\r\nmembers had sent in their resignation. Versailles everywhere was\r\ngaining ground; the Fort of Vauves was taken, that of Mont Rouge\r\nhad been dismantled, and breaches were opened in the city walls.\r\nThe leaders of the insurrection lost their senses, and gave way\r\nto every species of madness and folly. The army of Versailles soon\r\nentered the city from different points. The fight was desperate,\r\nthe carnage frightful. Dombrowski, the only general of ability, was\r\nkilled early in the struggle. Barricades were in almost every street.\r\nPrisoners on both sides were shot without mercy. The Communists set\r\nfire to the Tuileries, the Hôtel-de-Ville, the Ministry of Finance,\r\nthe Palace of the Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story is all blood and horror. The most pathetic\r\npart of it is the murder of the hostages, which took place on the\r\nmorning of May 24, and which cannot be told in this chapter. The\r\ndesperate leaders of the Commune had determined that if they must\r\nperish, Paris itself should be their funeral pyre.\r\n\r\nIt was General Eudes who organized the band of incendiaries called\r\n\"pétroleuses\" and gave out the petroleum. It was Félix Pyat, it\r\nwas said, who laid a train of gunpowder to blow up the Invalides,\r\nwhile another member of the Commune served out explosives.\r\n\r\nOn the night of May 24, the Hôtel-de-Ville was in flames. The smoke,\r\nat times a deep red, enveloped everything; the air was laden with\r\nthe nauseous odors of petroleum. The Tuileries, the Palace of the\r\nLegion of Honor, the Ministry of War, and the Treasury were flaming\r\nlike the craters of a great volcano.\r\n\r\nWe have heard much of _pétroleuses_. They appear to have worked\r\namong private houses in the more open parts of the city. Here is\r\na picture of one seen by an Englishman:--\r\n\r\n\"She walked with a rapid step under the shadow of a wall. She was\r\npoorly dressed, her age was between forty and fifty; her head was\r\nbound with a red-checked handkerchief, from which fell meshes of\r\ncoarse, uncombed hair. Her face was red, her eyes blurred, and\r\nshe moved with her eyes bent down to the ground. Her right hand\r\nwas in her pocket; in the other she held one of the high, narrow\r\ntin cans in which milk is carried in Paris, but which now contained\r\npetroleum. The street seemed deserted. She stopped and consulted\r\na dirty bit of paper which she held in her hand, paused a moment\r\nbefore the grated entrance to a cellar, and then went on her way\r\nsteadily, without haste. An hour after, that house was burning to\r\nthe ground. Sometimes these wretched women led little children\r\nby the hand, who were carrying bottles of petroleum. There was\r\na veritable army of these incendiaries, composed mainly of the\r\ndregs of society. This army had its chiefs, and each detachment\r\nwas charged with firing a quarter.\"\r\n\r\nThe orders for the conflagration of public edifices bore the stamp\r\nof the Commune and that of the Central Committee of the National\r\nGuard; also the seal of the war delegate. For private houses less\r\nceremony was used. Small tickets of the size of postage-stamps\r\nwere pasted on the walls of the doomed houses, with the letters,\r\nB. P. B. (_Bon Pour Brûler_). Some of these tickets were square,\r\nothers oval, with a Bacchante's head upon them. A _pétroleuse_\r\nwas to receive ten francs for every house which she set on fire.\r\n\r\nAll the sewers beneath Paris had been strewn with torpedoes, bombs,\r\nand inflammable materials, connected with electric wires. \"The\r\nreactionary quarters shall be blown up,\" was the announced intention\r\nof the Commune. Mercifully, these arrangements had not been completed\r\nwhen the Versailles troops obtained the mastery. Almost the first\r\nthing done was to send sappers and miners underground to cut the\r\nwires that connected electric currents with inflammable material\r\nin all parts of the city. The catacombs that underlie the eastern\r\npart of Paris were included in the incendiary arrangement.\r\n\r\nWhen Paris was at last in safety, and the Commune subdued, would\r\nthat it had been only the guilty on whom the great and awful vengeance\r\nfell!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _MONSEIGNEUR DARBOY._ (_Archbishop of Paris._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE HOSTAGES.\r\n\r\nAbout once in every seventy or eighty years some exceptionally\r\nmoving tragedy stirs the heart of the civilized world. The tragedy\r\nof our own century is the execution of the hostages in Paris, May\r\n24 and 26, 1871.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock on the morning of April 6, three weeks after the\r\nproclamation of the Commune, a body of the National Guard was drawn\r\nup on the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the Madeleine. A door\r\nsuddenly opened and a man came hastily out, followed by two National\r\nGuards shouting to their comrades. The man was arrested at once,\r\nmaking no resistance. It was the Abbé Duguerry, _curé_ of the\r\nMadeleine,[1]--the first of the so-called hostages arrested in\r\nretaliation for the summary execution of General Duval, who had\r\ncommanded one of the three columns that marched out of Paris the\r\nday before to attack the Versaillais.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Curé_ in France means rector; what we mean by a curate\r\nor assistant minister is there called _vicaire_.]\r\n\r\nBoth the _curé_ of the Madeleine and his _vicaire_, the Abbé Lamazou,\r\nwere that night arrested. The latter, who escaped death as a hostage,\r\npublished an account of his experiences; but he died not long after\r\nof heart disease, brought on by his excitement and suffering during\r\nthe Commune.\r\n\r\nThe same night Monseigneur Darboy, the archbishop of Paris, his\r\nchaplain, and eight other priests, were arrested. One was a missionary\r\njust returned from China, another was the Abbé Crozes, the admirable\r\nchaplain (_aumônier_) of the prison of La Roquette,--a man whose\r\ndeeds of charity would form a noble chapter of Christian biography.\r\n\r\nWhen Archbishop Darboy was brought before the notorious \"delegate,\"\r\nRaoul Rigault, he began to speak, saying, \"My children--\" \"Citizen,\"\r\ninterrupted Rigault, \"you are not here before children,--we are\r\nmen!\" This sally was heartily applauded in the publications of\r\nthe Commune.\r\n\r\nAs it would not be possible to sketch the lives and deaths of all\r\nthese victims of revolutionary violence, it may be well to select\r\nthe history of the youngest among them, Paul Seigneret.[1] His\r\nfather was a professor in the high school at Lyons. Paul was born\r\nin 1845, and was therefore twenty-six years old when he met death,\r\nas a hostage, at the hands of the Commune. His home had been a\r\nhappy and pious one, and he had a beloved brother Charles, to whom\r\nhe clung with the most tender devotion. Charles expected to be a\r\npriest; Paul was destined for the army, but he earnestly wished\r\nthat he too might enter the ministry. Lamartine's \"Jocelyn\" had\r\nmade a deep impression on him, but his father having objected to\r\nhis reading it, he laid it aside unfinished; what he had read,\r\nhowever, remained rooted in his memory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Memoir of Paul Seigneret, abridged in the \"Monthly\r\nPacket.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen Paul was eighteen, his father gave his sanction to his entering\r\nthe priesthood; he thought him too delicate, however, to lead the\r\nlife of a country pastor, and desired him, before he made up his\r\nmind as to his vocation, to accept a position offered him as tutor\r\nin a family in Brittany.\r\n\r\nPresent duties being sanctified, not hampered, by higher hopes and\r\naspirations, Paul gained the love and confidence of the family in\r\nwhich he taught, and also of the neighboring peasantry. \"He was,\"\r\nsays the lady whose children he instructed, \"like a good angel\r\nsent among us to do good and to give pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nWhen his time of probation was passed, he decided to enter a convent\r\nat Solesmes, and by submitting himself to convent rules, make sure\r\nof his vocation. But before making any final choice, we find from\r\nhis letters that \"if France were invaded,\" he claimed \"the right\r\nto do his duty as a citizen and a son.\"\r\n\r\nHe entered the convent at Solesmes, first as a postulant, then\r\nas a novice. \"The Holy Gospels,\" said his superior, \"Saint Paul's\r\nEpistles, and the Psalms were his favorite studies,--the food on\r\nwhich his piety was chiefly nourished. He also sought Christ in\r\nhistory.\"\r\n\r\nStill, he was not entirely satisfied with life in a convent; he\r\nwished to be more actively employed in doing good. He therefore\r\nbecame a student for the regular ministry,--a Seminarist of\r\nSaint-Sulpice. But when the Prussian armies were advancing on Paris,\r\nhe offered himself for hospital service, as did also his brother.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of passionate enthusiasm, speaking to that dear brother\r\nof the dangers awaiting those who had to seek and tend the wounded\r\non the field of battle, he cried: \"Do you think God may this year\r\ngrant me the grace of yielding up my life to Him as a sacrifice? For\r\nto fall, an expiatory sacrifice beneath the righteous condemnation\r\nthat hangs over France, would be to die for Him.\"\r\n\r\nThe war being over, he returned to the Seminary, March 15, 1871.\r\nOn March 18 the Commune was declared, and Lecomte and Thomas were\r\nmurdered; shortly after this the Seminary was invaded, the students\r\nwere dispersed, and the priests in charge made prisoners. Most of\r\nthe young men thus turned out into the streets left Paris. Paul\r\nat first intended to remain; but thinking that his family would\r\nbe anxious about him, he applied for a pass, intending to go to\r\nLyons. At the prefecture of police he and a fellow-student found a\r\ndense crowd waiting to pay two francs for permission to get away.\r\nThey were shown into a room where a man in a major's uniform sat\r\nat a table covered with glasses and empty bottles, with a woman\r\nbeside him. When he heard what they wanted, he broke into a volley\r\nof abuse, and assured them that the only pass he would give them\r\nwas a pass to prison. Accordingly, Paul and his companion soon\r\nfound themselves in the prison connected with the prefecture. The\r\ncells were so crowded that they were confined in a corridor with\r\nsix Jesuit fathers and some of their servants and lay brethren. A\r\nsort of community life was at once organized, with daily service\r\nand an hour for meditation. Paul esteemed it a privilege to enjoy\r\nthe conversation of the elder and more learned priests. He conversed\r\nwith them about the Bible, philosophy, and literature; \"He was\r\nready,\" says a companion who was saved, \"to meet a martyr's death;\r\nbut there was one horror he prayed to be spared,--that of being\r\ntorn in pieces by a mob.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 13, a turnkey announced to the priests that they were to\r\nleave the prefecture. \"I fear,\" he said, \"that you are to be taken\r\nto Mazas. I am not sure, but a man cannot have such good prisoners\r\nas you are in his charge without taking some interest in them.\"\r\n\r\nOn being brought forth from their corridor, they found themselves\r\nin a crowd of priests (hostages like themselves) who were being\r\nsent to Mazas. The youth of the Seminary students at once attracted\r\nattention, and the Vicar-General, Monseigneur Surat, said: \"I can\r\nunderstand that priests and old men should be here, gentlemen,\r\nbut not that you, mere Seminarists, should be forced to share the\r\ntroubles of your ecclesiastical superiors.\"\r\n\r\nThe transfer to Mazas was in the _voitures cellulaires_. They were\r\nso low and narrow that every jolt threw the occupant against the sides\r\nor roof. In one of these cells the venerable and infirm archbishop\r\nhad been transferred to Mazas a short time before.\r\n\r\nEach prisoner on reaching Mazas was shut up in a tiny cell. Paul\r\nwrote (for they were allowed writing materials):\r\n\r\n\"I have a nice little cell, with a bit of blue sky above it, to\r\nwhich my thoughts fly, and a hammock, so that it is possible for\r\nme to sleep again. I hardly dare to tell you I am happy, and am\r\ntrusting myself in God's hands, for I am anxious about you, and\r\nanxious for our poor France. I have my great comfort,--work. I\r\nhave already written an essay on Saint Paul, which I have been\r\nsome time meditating. I am expecting a Bible, and with that I think\r\nI could defy weariness for years. A few days ago I discovered that\r\none of my friends was next to me. We bid each other good night\r\nand good morning by rapping against the wall, and this would make\r\nus less lonely, were we oppressed by solitude.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of this letter he adds,--\r\n\r\n\"I have at last received the dear Bible. You should have seen how I\r\nseized and kissed it! Now the Commune may leave me here to moulder,\r\nif it will!\"\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, May 21, the Versailles army began to make its way into\r\nParis, and the Commune, seeing its fantastic and terrible power\r\nabout to pass away, tried to startle the world by its excesses.\r\nOrders were sent at once to Mazas to send the archbishop, the priests,\r\nSenator Bonjean, suspected spies, and _sergents de ville_ to that\r\npart of the prison of La Roquette reserved for condemned criminals.\r\nPaul and his friend the other Seminarist were of the number.\r\n\r\nBefore the gates of La Roquette they found a fierce crowd shouting\r\ninsults and curses. Many were women and children. \"Here they come!\"\r\nthe mob yelled. \"Down with the priests! shoot them! kill them!\"\r\nPaul preserved his composure, and looked on with a smile of serene\r\nhope upon his face. \"The scene was like that horror from which he\r\nhad prayed to be saved. His terror was gone. His prayer had been\r\nanswered.\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoners on reaching La Roquette were first passed into a\r\nhall, where they found the archbishop and several priests. The\r\nformer was calm, but he was ill, and his features bore marks of\r\nacute suffering. After an hour's delay the prisoners were locked\r\ninto separate cells, from which real malefactors had been removed\r\nto make room for them.\r\n\r\nIn the next cell to Paul was the Abbé Planchet. By standing at\r\nthe window they could hear each other's voices. The abbé could\r\nread Thomas à Kempis to his fellow prisoner, and they daily recited\r\ntogether the litany for the dying.\r\n\r\nOne of the imprisoned priests was a missionary lately returned\r\nfrom China; and when they met at the hours allowed for fresh air in\r\nthe courtyard, Paul was eager to hear his accounts of the martyrdom\r\nand steadfastness of Chinese converts. \"M. Paul,\" said an old soldier\r\nwho was one of the hostages, \"seemed to look on martyrdom as a\r\nprivilege, regretting only the pain it would cause his family.\"\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, May 24, the execution of the archbishop and five\r\nothers took place, Paul saw them pass by his window; one of the\r\nescort shook his gun at him, and pointing it at the archbishop,\r\ngave him to understand what they were going to do.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Thursday, May 25, the order came. \"Citizens,\" said\r\nthe messenger who brought it, \"pay attention, and answer when your\r\nnames are called. Fifteen of you are wanted.\" As each was named,\r\nhe stepped out of the ranks and took his place in the death-row.\r\nPaul Seigneret was one of them. He seemed perfectly calm, and gently\r\npressed the hand of his Seminary friend who was not summoned.\r\n\r\nIn the courtyard they were joined by thirty-five ex-policemen,\r\nso-called hostages like themselves. The execution was to take place\r\nin the Rue Haxo, at the farthest extremity of Belleville, and the\r\nmarch was made on foot, so that the victims were exposed to all the\r\ninsults of the populace. It has been said that when they reached\r\nthe Rue Haxo, where they were placed against a wall, Paul was thrown\r\ndown while attempting to defend an aged priest, and was maltreated\r\nby the crowd; but this account was not confirmed when, four days\r\nlater, the bodies were taken from the trench into which they had\r\nbeen thrown: Paul's showed no sign of violence. His eyes were closed,\r\nhis face was calm. His cassock was pierced with balls and stained\r\nwith blood. He is buried at Saint-Sulpice.\r\n\r\nHis father received the news of his death calmly. He wrote: \"Let\r\nus bear our poor child's death as much like Christians and as much\r\nlike men as we can. May his blood, joined to that of so many other\r\ninnocent victims, finally appease the justice of God,\" But when,\r\nshortly afterwards, Charles died of an illness brought on by excessive\r\nfatigue in serving the ambulances, the father sank under the double\r\nstroke, and died fifteen days after his last remaining son.\r\n\r\nFrom the death of the youngest and the humblest of these ecclesiastical\r\nhostages, we will turn now to that of the venerable archbishop, and\r\nto his experiences during the forty-eight hours that he passed at\r\nLa Roquette, after having been transferred to it from Mazas.\r\n\r\nWith studied cruelty and insolence, a cell of the worst description\r\nwas assigned to the chief of the clergy in France. It had been\r\ncommonly appropriated to murderers on the eve of their execution.\r\nThere was barely standing-room in it beside the filthy and squalid\r\nbed. The beds and cells of the other priests were at least clean,\r\nbut this treatment of the archbishop had been ordered by the Commune.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of May 23 the prisoners had been permitted to breathe\r\nfresh air in a narrow paved courtyard; but the archbishop was too\r\nweak and ill for exercise; he lay half fainting on his bed. In\r\naddition to his other sufferings he was faint from hunger, for\r\nthe advance of the Versailles troops had cut off the Commune's\r\nsupplies, and the hostages were of course the last persons they\r\nwished to care for. Père Olivariet (shot three days later in the\r\nsame party as Paul Seigneret, in the Rue Haxo) had had some cake\r\nand chocolate sent him before he left Mazas; with these he fed the\r\nold man by mouthfuls. This was all the nourishment the archbishop\r\nhad during the two days he spent at La Roquette. Mr. Washburne,\r\nthe American minister, had with difficulty obtained permission to\r\nsend him a small quantity of strengthening wine during his stay\r\nat Mazas. But a greater boon than earthly food or drink was brought\r\nhim by Père Olivariet, who had received while at Mazas, in a common\r\npasteboard box, some of the consecrated wafers used by the Roman\r\nCatholic Church in holy communion; and he had it in his power to\r\ngive the archbishop the highest consolation that could have been\r\noffered him.\r\n\r\nIt had been intended to execute the hostages on the 23d; but the\r\ndirector of the prison, endeavoring to evade the horrible task of\r\ndelivering up his prisoners, pronounced the first order he received\r\ninformal.\r\n\r\nThe accursed 24th of May dawned, brilliant and beautiful. The archbishop\r\nwent down in the early morning to obtain the breath of fresh air\r\nallowed him. Judge Bonjean, who had never professed himself a believer,\r\ncame up to him and prayed him for his blessing, saying that he had\r\nseen the truth, as it were on the right hand of Death, and he too\r\nwas about to depart in the true faith of a Christian.\r\n\r\nBy this time the insurgents held little more of Paris than the\r\nheights of Belleville, Père la Chaise, and the neighborhood of La\r\nRoquette, which is not far from the Place de la Bastille. The Communal\r\nGovernment had quitted the Hôtel-de-Ville and taken refuge not far\r\nfrom La Roquette, in the _Mairie_ of the Eleventh Arrondissement.\r\n\r\nAt six in the morning of May 24th,[1] a second order came to the\r\ndirector of the prison to deliver up all hostages in his hands. He\r\nremonstrated, saying he could not act upon an order to deliver up\r\nprisoners who were not named. Finally, a compromise was effected;\r\nsix were to be chosen. The commander of the firing party asked for\r\nthe prison register. The names of the hostages were not there.\r\nThen the list from Mazas was demanded. The director could not find\r\nit. At last, after long searching, they discovered it themselves.\r\nGenton, the man in command, sat down to pick out his six victims.\r\nHe wrote Darboy, Bonjean, Jecker, Allard, Clerc, Ducoudray. Then\r\nhe paused, rubbed out Jecker, and put in Duguerrey. Darboy, as we\r\nknow, was the archbishop; Bonjean, judge of the Court of Appeals;\r\nAllard, head-chaplain to the hospitals, who had been unwearied\r\nin his services to the wounded; Clerc and Ducoudray were Jesuit\r\nfathers; Duguerrey was pastor of the Madeleine. Jecker was a banker\r\nwho had negotiated Mexican loans for the Government. The next day\r\nthe Commune made a present of him to Genton, who, after trying\r\nin vain to get a few hundred thousand francs out of him for his\r\nransom, shot him, assisted by four others, one of whom was Ferré,\r\nand flung his body into the cellar of a half-built house upon the\r\nheights of Belleville.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Macmillan's Magazine, 1873.]\r\n\r\nWhen the order drawn up by Genton had been approved at headquarters,\r\nthe director of the prison had no resource but to deliver up his\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nAnother man, wearing a scarf of office, had now joined the party.\r\nHe was very impatient, and accused the others roundly of a want\r\nof revolutionary spirit. He landed afterwards in New York, where\r\nhis fellow-Communists gave him a public reception.\r\n\r\nOne of the warders of the prison, Henrion by name, made some attempt\r\nto expostulate with the _Vengeurs de Flourens_, who had been told off\r\nfor the execution. \"What would you have?\" was the answer. \"Killing is\r\nnot at all amusing. We were killing this morning at the Prefecture\r\nof Police. But they say this is reprisal. The Versaillais have\r\nbeen killing our generals.\"\r\n\r\nSoon Henrion was called upon to open the fourth corridor. \"I must\r\ngo and get the keys,\" he answered. He had them in his hand at the\r\nmoment. He went rapidly away, flung the keys into a heap of filth,\r\nand rushed out of the prison. By means of a twenty-franc gold piece\r\nthat he had with him, he passed out of the gates of Paris, and\r\nsought refuge with the Bavarians at Vincennes.\r\n\r\nMeantime another bunch of keys was found, and the executioners,\r\nled by Ferré, Lolive, and Mégy,--that member of the Commune whom\r\nnone of them seemed to know,--hurried upstairs. In the crowd were\r\n_gamins_ and women, National Guards, Garibaldians, and others, but\r\nchiefly the _Vengeurs de Flourens_, a corps of which an Englishman\r\nwho served the Commune said: \"They were to a man all blackguards.\"\r\n\r\nUp the prison stairs they swarmed, shouting threats and curses,\r\nespecially against the archbishop, who was erroneously believed by\r\nthe populace of Paris to have had provisions hidden in the vaults\r\nof Notre Dame and in his palace during the siege. A turnkey was\r\nordered to summon the six prisoners; but when he found whom he\r\nwas to call, he refused, and the officer in command had to call\r\nthem himself.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop's name was first. He came out of his cell at once,\r\nwearing his purple cassock. Then Gaspard Duguerrey was summoned.\r\nHe was eighty years old. He did not answer immediately, and was\r\ncalled a second time. Next, Léon Ducoudray was called,--a Jesuit\r\nfather, head of a college, a tall, fine-looking man. He came forth\r\nwith a proud smile. Alexis Clerc, also a Jesuit father, stepped\r\nforth briskly, almost gayly. Then came Michel Allard, the hospital\r\nchaplain,--a gentle, kindly-looking man. The three weeks before\r\nhis arrest had been spent by him in attending upon the wounded of\r\nthe Commune. Finally the judge, Senator Louis Bonjean, was called.\r\n\"In a moment,\" he replied; \"I am putting my coat on.\" At this,\r\none of the leaders seized him. \"You will want no coat where you\r\nare going,\" he cried; \"come as you are.\"\r\n\r\nThe only one of the party who seemed to tremble was the aged _curé_\r\nof the Madeleine; but his nervous tremor soon passed off, and he\r\nwas calm like the others. As they went down the winding stairs, the\r\narchbishop (being first) stepped rapidly before the rest, and turning\r\nat the bottom, raised his hand and pronounced the absolution. After\r\nthis there was silence among the prisoners. \"The chaplain Allard\r\nalone,\" said one of the Commune, \"kept on muttering something.\" He\r\nwas reciting, half aloud, the service for the dying.\r\n\r\nPère Ducoudray had his breviary in his hand. He gave it, as he\r\npassed, to the concierge of the prison. The captain of the firing\r\nparty snatched it, and flung it on the fire.\r\n\r\nWhen the spot was reached where the shooting was to take place,\r\nthe archbishop addressed some words of pity and forgiveness to\r\nthe murderers. Two of the firing party knelt at his feet; but he\r\nhad not time to bless them before, with threats and blows, they\r\nwere forced to rise, and the archbishop was ordered to go and place\r\nhimself against the wall.\r\n\r\nBut here, when the bitterness of death was almost passed, occurred\r\na difficulty. Two of the leaders wanted to have the execution in a\r\nlittle inner courtyard, shut in by blank walls. So the procession\r\nwas again formed, marched through long passages and up stairways,\r\nand halted while keys were searched for, before it came to the spot.\r\nOn the way, a man crept up to the archbishop, uttering blasphemies\r\ninto his ear. The good man's mild look of reproof and pain so moved\r\none of the sub-officers that he drove the man off, saying: \"We\r\nare here to shoot these men, not to insult them.\"\r\n\r\nThe six victims were at last placed in a line, with their backs\r\nto the wall. As Ferré was giving the order to fire, the archbishop\r\nraised his right hand in order to give, as his last act, his episcopal\r\nblessing. As he did so, Lolive exclaimed: \"That's your benediction\r\nis it?--now take mine!\" and shot the old man through the body with\r\na revolver. All were shot dead at once, save M. Bonjean.\r\n\r\nThere is now a marble slab in the little court inscribed with their\r\nnames, and headed: \"Respect this place, which witnessed the death\r\nof noble men and martyrs.\" The warder, Henrion, was put in charge\r\nof the place, and planted it with beds of flowers.\r\n\r\nThe execution over, the leaders searched the cells of their victims.\r\nIn most of them they found nothing; in two were worn cassocks, and\r\nin the archbishop's was his pastoral ring. One of the party said\r\nthe amethyst in it was a diamond; another contradicted him, and\r\nsaid it was an emerald. The bodies lay unburied until two o'clock in\r\nthe morning, when four or five of those who had shot them despoiled\r\nthem, one hanging the archbishop's chain and cross about his own\r\nneck, another appropriating his silver shoe-buckles. Then they\r\nloaded the bodies on a hand-barrow and carried them to an open\r\ntrench dug in Père la Chaise. There, four days later, when the\r\nVersaillais had full possession of the city, they were found. The\r\narchbishop and the Abbé Duguerrey were taken to the archbishop's\r\nhouse with a guard of honor, and are buried at Notre Dame. The\r\ntwo Jesuit fathers were buried in their own cemetery, and Judge\r\nBonjean and the hospital chaplain sleep in honored graves in Père\r\nla Chaise.\r\n\r\nAfter these executions a large number of so-called\r\n\"hostages,\"--ecclesiastics, soldiers of the line, _sergents de\r\nville_, and police agents remained shut up in La Roquette. It was\r\nSaturday, May 27, the day before Whit Sunday. Says the Abbé Lamazou,--\r\n\r\n\"It was a few minutes past three, and I was kneeling in my cell\r\nsaying my prayers for the day, when I heard bolts rattling in the\r\ncorridor. We were no longer locked in with keys. Suddenly the door\r\nof my cell was thrown open, and a voice cried: 'Courage! our time\r\nhas come.' 'Yes, courage!' I answered. 'God's will be done.' I\r\nhad on my ecclesiastical habit, and went out into the corridor.\r\nThere I found a mixed crowd of prisoners, priests, soldiers, and\r\nNational Guards. The priests and the National Guards seemed resigned\r\nto their fate, but the soldiers, who had fought the Prussians, could\r\nnot believe it was intended to shoot them. Suddenly a voice, loud as\r\na trumpet, rose above the din. 'Friends,' it cried, 'hearken to a\r\nman who desires to save you. These wretches of the Commune have\r\nkilled more than enough people. Don't let yourselves be murdered!\r\nJoin me. Let us resist. Sooner than give you up I will die with\r\nyou!' The speaker was Poiret, one of the warders of the prison. He\r\nhad been horrified by what had been done already, and when ordered\r\nby his superiors to give up the prisoners in his corridor to a\r\nyelling crowd, he had shut the doors on the third story behind\r\nhim, and was advising us, at the risk of his own life, to organize\r\nresistance.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbé joined him with, \"Don't let us be shot, my friends; let\r\nus defend ourselves. Trust in God; he is on our side!\"\r\n\r\nBut many hesitated. \"Resistance is mere madness,\" they said; and\r\na soldier shouted, \"They don't want to kill _us_; they want the\r\npriests! Don't let us lose our lives defending _them_!\"\r\n\r\n\"The _sergents de ville_ in the story below you,\" cried Poiret,\r\n\"are going to defend themselves, They are making a barricade across\r\nthe door of their corridor. We have no arms, but we have courage.\r\nDon't let us be shot down by the rabble.\"\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to make a hole in the floor, and so to communicate\r\nwith the _sergents de ville_. The prisoners armed themselves with\r\nboards and iron torn from their bedsteads, and in five minutes\r\nhad made an opening through the floor. A non-commissioned officer\r\nfrom below climbed through it, and arranged with Poiret the plan\r\nof defence.\r\n\r\nBy this time the inner courtyard of the prison was invaded by a\r\nrough and squalid crowd, come to take a hand in whatever murder or\r\nmischief might be done. The besieged put mattresses before their\r\nwindows for protection. The man who led the mob was one Pasquier,\r\na murderer who had been in a condemned cell in La Roquette till\r\nlet out by the general jail-delivery of the Commune.\r\n\r\nTwo barricades were built like that on the floor below. Pasquier\r\nand some of his followers had burst open the outer door, and were\r\nendeavoring to burn both the prison and the prisoners. \"Never fear,\"\r\ncried a corporal who had superintended the hasty erection of the\r\nbarricades; \"I put nothing combustible into them. They can't burn\r\nfloor tiles and wire mattresses. Bring all the water you can.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd continued to shout threats. The battery from Père la\r\nChaise, they cried, was coming; and often a voice would shout,\r\n\"Soldiers of the Loire, surrender! We will not hurt you. We will\r\nset you at liberty!\" A few soldiers trusted this promise, and as\r\nsoon as they got into the crowd were massacred.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the tumult came a sudden lull; the besieged could see\r\nthat something strange had taken place. The crowd had been informed\r\nthat the Government, alarmed by the advance of the Versailles troops,\r\nhad abandoned its headquarters at the _mairie_ of the Eleventh\r\nArrondissement, and had gone to Belleville. Amazed and confused\r\nby this intelligence, the mob followed its leaders. Only a few\r\nminutes before it left, two guns and a mortar had been brought\r\nto fire on the prison; they were now dragged away in the wake of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nThe criminal prisoners at La Roquette were in a state of great\r\nexcitement. They had been liberated, and such weapons as could be\r\nfound were put into their hands; but they were not inclined either\r\nto kill their fellow-captives or to fight for the Commune. They\r\nhastily made off, shouting, \"Vive la Commune! Vive la République!\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the prison director and his officials had disappeared.\r\nThe prison doors were open. Then came another danger: soldiers\r\nof the Commune, fleeing from the vengeance of the Versaillais,\r\nmight seek refuge in the prison. With much difficulty the Abbé\r\nLamazou persuaded Poiret and some other warders who had stood with\r\nhim, to close the gates till the arrival of troops from Versailles.\r\nIt was still more difficult, now that a way was open to escape,\r\nto persuade his fellow-captives to remain in prison. Some priests\r\nwould not take his advice, among them Monseigneur Surat, the\r\nvicar-general. He had secured a suit of citizen's clothes, and\r\nhoped to escape in safety. In vain the Abbé Lamazou called out\r\nto him, \"To go is certain death; to stay is possible safety.\" He\r\nwas killed most cruelly, together with two' priests and a layman.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock at night, firing seemed to cease in the city,\r\nbut outside of the prison the maddened crowd continued all night\r\nhowling insults and curses. Hours seemed ages to the anxious and now\r\nfamished captives, shut up in the great building. The barricade of\r\nthe Rue de la Roquette was near them, still defended by insurgents;\r\nbut in the early dawn it was abandoned, and shortly after, a battalion\r\nof marines took possession of La Roquette. The resistance of the\r\nprisoners, which had seemed at first so desperate, had proved\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nInnumerable other anecdotes have found their way into print concerning\r\nthe last hours of the Commune; but I will rather tell of Mégy, the\r\nmember of the Council who, in his scarf of office, animated the\r\nparty that slew the archbishop and his, five companions.\r\n\r\nHe reached New York in 1878, and, as I said, was received with\r\nan ovation by a colony of escaped Communists who had settled on\r\nour shores. A reporter connected with the New York \"World\" called\r\nupon Mégy, and here is his account of the interview:--\r\n\r\n\"'I was born in Paris, in 1844,' said the ex-member of the Commune,\r\nlighting a cigar; 'I went through a primary school, and learned\r\nbut little. I was apprenticed to a machinist. When I was twenty I\r\nfound work on the Suez Canal. I was already a member of a secret\r\nsociety organized against the Empire, with Blanqui at its head.\r\nIn 1866 I came back to Paris, and persuaded all my fellow-workmen\r\nin the establishment where I was employed to become conspirators.\r\nWe waited for a good opportunity to commence an insurrection. Some\r\nof us wanted to begin when Pierre Bonaparte murdered Victor Noir;\r\nbut it was put off till February 7, when about three thousand of us\r\nrushed into the streets, began raising barricades, and proclaimed\r\na Republic. The next day two thousand republicans were arrested.\r\nOn February 11 six police agents came to my house at a quarter\r\npast five in the morning. I had a pistol, and when the first one\r\nentered my room to arrest me, I shot him dead. You should have\r\nseen how the others scampered downstairs. I am glad I killed him.\r\nBut five minutes after, I was overpowered, bound, and taken to\r\nprison. I was condemned to twenty years in New Caledonia, with\r\nhard labor. I was sent to Toulon, but before my embarkation the\r\nRepublic was proclaimed, and a decree of the Government set me at\r\nliberty. I came to Paris, and was named a member of the Municipal\r\nCouncil. In October, 1870, during the siege, an order was passed\r\nfor my arrest because I endeavored to deprive General Trochu of\r\nhis command. I hid myself, enlisted under a false name, and fought\r\nthe Prussians. Then I went to the South of France, and waited to\r\nsee what would happen. I was there when the Commune was proclaimed.\r\nI arrested the prefect of Marseilles on my own responsibility, and\r\nput myself in his place. I was prefect of Marseilles for eight\r\ndays. Early in April I made my way to Paris, was made a general,\r\nand put in charge of Fort Issy.[l] When Fort Issy fell, I was made\r\ncommander-in-chief on the left bank of the Seine. I ordered the\r\nPalace of the Legion of Honor to be set on fire; I defended the\r\nbarricades on the Boulevard of Magenta; and when I left them on\r\nMay 24, I found that Ferré and Deleschuze had given orders to shoot\r\nthe hostages because the troops of Thiers had shot eight of our\r\nofficers.'\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: General Rossel gave his opinion of the officers in\r\ncommand at Fort Issy in his letter to the Commune.]\r\n\r\n\"'Did you approve that order?'\" asked the \"World's\" reporter.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes; why not? Of course I approved it. I went at once to La Roquette,\r\nto be present at the execution. We were one hundred and fifty men,\r\nbut one hundred and twenty of them slunk away, and only thirty\r\nremained for the work we came for.'\r\n\r\n\"'And what did you do?'\r\n\r\n\"'_Ma foi!_ I don't particularly care to say what I did; it might\r\ninjure me here where I have got work. We called out the men we\r\ncame to shoot, and we shot them as that kind of thing is generally\r\ndone. We took them down into a courtyard, put them against a wall,\r\nand gave the order to fire; that was all.'\r\n\r\n\"After a minute's silence, Mégy added: 'It was all M. Thiers' fault.\r\nWe offered to give him up the hostages if he would give us Blanqui;\r\nbut he refused, and so we shot them. After the execution I fought to\r\nthe last. I escaped from Paris in a coal-cart, and went to Geneva.\r\nI have had work in London and in Birmingham, and now I have got\r\nwork in New York.'\"\r\n\r\nHe went on to affirm that there was a large colony of Communists in\r\nthat city; that America needed revolutionizing as much as France;\r\nthat Cardinal McCloskey might find himself in the same position\r\nas Monseigneur Darboy; and so on.\r\n\r\nI have quoted this interview with Mégy at some length, because it\r\nshows the Communists painted by one of their own number. Before\r\nthe reporter left him, he chanced to pronounce the name of Mr.\r\nWashburne. \"Washburne is a liar and a cur,\" cried Mégy, angrily.\r\n\"Before the Commune ended, some of our people asked him what the\r\nVersailles Government would do with us if we surrendered or were\r\nconquered. 'I assure you,' he said, 'you would be shot.' During\r\nthe siege of Paris, Washburne was a German spy. He is a villanous\r\nold rascal.\"\r\n\r\nIn studying the history of the Commune, it is desirable to remember\r\ndates. The whole affair lasted seventy-three days. On March 18 the\r\nguns on Montmartre were taken by the populace, Generals Lecomte\r\nand Thomas were shot, and the Commune was proclaimed. Military\r\noperations were begun April 4. On April 9 Fort Valérien began to\r\nthrow shells into Paris. From that day forward, the Versailles\r\ntroops continued to advance, taking possession one by one of the\r\nforts and the positions of the Federals. On Sunday, May 21, the\r\nVersailles troops began to enter Paris, and fought their way steadily\r\nfrom street to street till Sunday, May 27, when all was over. The\r\nhostages were not hostages in the true sense of the word; they had\r\nnot been given up in pledge for the performance of any promise. They\r\nwere persons seized for purposes of intimidation and retaliation,\r\nas in 1826 the Turks seized the most prominent Christians in Scio.\r\n\r\nDuring the last five days of the Commune, Dombrowski, its only\r\ngeneral with military capacity, was killed,--it is supposed, by\r\none of his own men. The Tuileries, the Hôtel-de-Ville, and numerous\r\nother buildings were fired, the Dominican Brothers were massacred,\r\nand the executions in the Rue Haxo took place, besides others in\r\nother parts of Belleville and at the Prefecture. One of the most\r\ndiabolical pieces of destruction attempted was that of the Grand\r\nLivre.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Livre is the book kept in the French Treasury in which\r\nare inscribed the names and accounts of all those who hold Government\r\nsecurities; and as the French Government is the proprietor of all\r\nrailroads, telegraph systems, and many other things that in England\r\nand the United States are left to private enterprise, the loss of\r\nthe Grand Livre would have involved thousands upon thousands of\r\nfamilies in ruin. For a man to have his name on the Grand Livre\r\nis to constitute him what is called a _rentier_, _rentes_ being\r\nthe French word for dividends from the public funds.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Livre is kept at the Ministry of Finance; that building\r\nFerré ordered to be summarily destroyed, uttering the words, \"Flambez\r\nFinances.\" The building was accordingly set on fire the day before\r\nthe Commune fell; and for some days after, it was thought throughout\r\nall France that the Grand Livre had perished. By heroic exertions\r\nsome of it was saved, the officials in charge of it rushing into\r\nthe flames and rescuing that portion of it which contained the\r\nnames of living property-holders, I while they let the records of\r\npast generations burn.\r\n\r\nThere was in existence a duplicate copy of the Grand Livre, though\r\nthis was known only to the higher officials of the Treasury. It was\r\nkept in a sort of register's office not far from the Tuileries,\r\nand was in the care of a M. Chazal. When the Tuileries and the\r\nTreasury were on fire, the object of M. Chazal and of all who knew\r\nof the precious duplicate was to save it, in case the building\r\nin which it was deposited should share in the conflagration.\r\n\r\nOf course the Grand Livre is of vast bulk. This copy was contained\r\nin great bundles of loose sheets. Luckily these papers were in stout\r\noaken boxes on the ground-floor of a detached building opening\r\non a courtyard. The Versailles troops had reached the spot, and\r\nninety sappers and miners, with seven brave firemen, were at work\r\nwith water-buckets attempting to save the main building, which\r\nwas blazing fiercely when M. Chazal arrived. Already the detached\r\nbuilding in which the precious duplicate was stored was on fire.\r\nThere was no place to which he could safely remove the precious\r\npapers, no means of transport to carry them away.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege orders had been given to have large piles of sand\r\nplaced in the courtyards of all public buildings, to smother shells\r\nshould any fall there. There were three of these sand-piles lying in\r\nthe yard of this record office. In them deep trenches were rapidly\r\ndug; and the boxes were buried. Then the pile was covered with\r\nall the incombustible rubbish that could be collected; and had\r\nthe Grand Livre been really destroyed, as for some days it was\r\nbelieved to have been, every Government creditor would have found\r\nhis interests safe, through the exertions of M. Chazal and the\r\nintrepid band who worked under him.\r\n\r\nIn somewhat the same manner the gold and silver in the vaults of\r\nthe Bank of France were saved from pillage. The narrow staircase\r\nleading to the vaults, down which only one man could pass at a\r\ntime, was by order of the directors filled up with sand during the\r\nsiege.\r\n\r\nThough my readers may be weary of sad tales of massacre, that of\r\nthe Dominicans of Arceuil remains to be told. Their convent was in\r\nthe suburbs of Paris; it had been turned by them into a hospital\r\nduring the siege, and it continued to be so used during the Commune.\r\nAfter the fall of Fort Issy, the insurgent troops made their\r\nheadquarters not far from the convent. They were commanded by a\r\ngeneral of some ability, but of ferocious character, named Serizier.\r\nHe was in the habit of saying, as he looked from his window into\r\nthe garden of the Dominicans, \"Those rascals ought to be roasted\r\nalive.\" On May 17 the roof of the building in which he lived caught\r\nfire. The Dominicans tucked up their gowns and did their best to\r\nput it out. When all was over, they were ordered to wait upon the\r\ngeneral. They supposed that they were going to be thanked for their\r\nexertions, and were amazed at finding themselves accused of having\r\nset the building on fire as a signal to the Versaillais. The next\r\nmorning a battalion of Communist soldiers surrounded their convent.\r\nThe prior, his monks, pupils, and servants, were arrested and marched\r\nto a casemate of a neighboring fort. Their convent was stripped of\r\neverything. The building, however, was saved by a _ruse_ on the\r\npart of an officer of the Commune, one of the better class. They\r\nwere two days without food, and were then driven into Paris like a\r\nflock of sheep, their black-and-white dress exposing them to all the\r\ninsults and ribaldry of the excited multitude; for the Versaillais\r\nwere in Paris, and hope, among those who knew the situation, was\r\ndrawing to an end. That night the Dominicans were confined in a\r\nprison on the Avenue d'Italie, where a friend of Serizier's (known\r\nas Bobêche) was instructed what to do with them. During the morning,\r\nhowever, Bobêche went to a drinking saloon, and while there the\r\nman he left in charge received orders to send the priests to work\r\non a barricade. He affected to misunderstand the order, and sent,\r\ninstead, fifteen National Guards imprisoned for insubordination.\r\nWhen Bobêche came back, half-drunk, he was furious. \"What! was the\r\nblood of priests to be spared, and that of patriots imperilled\r\nat a post of danger?\" Before long the order was repeated. \"We will\r\ntend your wounded, General,\" said the prior, \"we will go after\r\nthem under fire, but we will not do the work of soldiers for you.\" At\r\nthis, soldiers were called out to shoot the Dominicans. They were\r\nreluctant to obey, and Serizier dared not risk disobedience. The\r\nfathers were remanded to prison, but were soon called out one by\r\none. Some volunteers had been found willing to do the shooting,\r\namong them two women, the fiercest of the band. As the fathers came\r\ninto the street, all were shot at, but some were untouched; and\r\nsoon succeeded a dreadful scene. Round and round the open square,\r\nand up side streets, they were hunted. Four of the twenty escaped.\r\nMen laughed and women clapped their hands at seeing the priests run.\r\nThen Serizier went back to the prison, and was making preparations\r\nto shoot the remaining prisoners, who were laymen, when one of\r\nhis subordinates leaned over him and whispered that the troops of\r\nVersailles were at hand. He dropped his papers and made off. The\r\ntroops came on, and picked up the bodies of the dead Dominicans.\r\nSerizier was not arrested till some months after, when the wife of\r\none of his victims, who had dogged him constantly after her husband's\r\ndeath, discovered him in disguise and gave him up to justice.\r\n\r\nThe Prefecture of Police, which stands upon an island in the Seine,\r\nin the heart of Paris, had in those days a small prison in its\r\nmain building, and an annex for women. These prisons were full\r\nof prisoners,--_réactionnaires_, as they were called in the last\r\ndays of the struggle.\r\n\r\nOn May 26, as has been said, nothing remained for the Commune to do\r\nbut mischief. Raoul Rigault was busy, with his corps of _Vengeurs\r\nde Flourens_, getting through as many executions as possible; Félix\r\nPyat was organizing underground explosions, Ferré, the destruction\r\nof public buildings. A gentleman[1] confined in the women's part\r\nof the Prefecture, chancing to look down from a high window on\r\nthe offices of the main building, saw beneath him eight men in\r\nthe uniform of the Commune, one of them wearing much gold lace,\r\nwho were saturating the window-frames with something from a bottle,\r\nand bedaubing other woodwork with mops dipped in a bucket that\r\nhe presumed contained petroleum. Their caps were pulled low over\r\ntheir eyes, as if they did not wish to be recognized. At last he\r\nsaw the officer strike a match and apply it to the woodwork, which\r\ncaught fire immediately. Then rose frightful shrieks from the prisons\r\nboth of the men and the women, for many others had seen what was\r\ngoing on. An earnest appeal to a turnkey to go to the director\r\nof the prison and represent to him that all his prisoners would\r\nbe burned, was met by the answer that he did not take orders from\r\nprisoners. But all turnkeys were not Communists, though Communist\r\nofficials were set over them. Some of them took advantage of the\r\nconfusion to look into the cells, and speak hope and comfort to\r\nthe prisoners. But as the flames caught the great wooden porch of\r\nthe Prefecture, the screams of the women were heart-rending; They\r\neven disturbed Ferré, who sent orders \"to stop their squalling.\"\r\nOne warder, Braquond, ventured to remonstrate. \"Bah!\" said Ferré,\r\n\"they are only women belonging to gendarmes and _sergents de ville_;\r\nwe shall be well rid of them.\" Then Braquond resolved to organize\r\na revolt, and save the prisoners. He ran to the corridor, and with\r\na voice of authority ordered all the cell-doors to be opened, thus\r\nreleasing four hundred prisoners. Braquond put himself at their\r\nhead and led them on. But when they reached the outer gate, they\r\nwere just in time to witness the departure of the last _Vengeur de\r\nFlourens_. Ferré had just received news that the troops of Versailles\r\nwere close at hand, and he and his subordinates fled, leaving the\r\nprisoners to shift for themselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Le Figaro.]\r\n\r\nBut though delivered from the Commune, not only was the Prefecture\r\nand all in it in peril, but every building and every life upon the\r\nisland. Quantities of ammunition had been stored in the Prefecture;\r\nif that caught fire, the \"Cité\" (as that part of Paris is called)\r\nand all its inhabitants would be blown into the air. The citizens\r\nof the quarter, the turnkeys, and the prisoners had nothing but\r\ntheir hands with which to fight the flames. In the midst of the\r\nfire they began to carry out the gunpowder. They had to make all\r\nspeed, yet to be very careful. One train of powder escaping from a\r\nbarrel, one sack of cartridges, with a rent in it, falling on the\r\npavement, where sparks were dropping about, might have destroyed\r\nthe whole \"Cité.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a brave, stout woman, mistress of a coal and wood yard,\r\nnamed Madame Saint-Chély. She was a native of Auvergne, whence\r\nall porters and water-carriers in Paris come. With her sleeves\r\ntucked up, and her hair flying, she kept carrying out sack after\r\nsack of cartridges, undaunted, though her clothes caught fire.\r\nBending beneath the weight upon her back, she emptied them into\r\nthe basin of the fountain that stands in the middle of the Place,\r\nthen rushed back for more, while the flames poured from the windows\r\nof the upper story. Her activity and cheerfulness animated every\r\none.\r\n\r\nThere was also a barber named Labois, who distinguished himself\r\nby his courage and activity in rolling barrels of powder out of\r\nthe cellar of the prefecture, and plunging them into the Seine.\r\n\r\nWhen several tons of powder and twenty millions of cartridges had\r\nbeen carried out, danger from that source was over. The next thing was\r\nto fight the flames. Then they discovered that all the fire-engines\r\nhad been sent away. Every basin, pitcher, bucket, or saucepan on\r\nthe island was put into requisition. Surrounded by the Seine, they\r\nhad plenty of water. All worked with a will. At last an engine\r\ncame, sent in to their help from Rambouillet.\r\n\r\nOne part of the Prefecture, whose burning caused innumerable sparks,\r\nwas the depot for lost property. It contained, among other things\r\ntwenty thousand umbrellas.\r\n\r\nIt was above all things desirable to remove the straw bedding of\r\nthe prisoners, stored by day in one large room, and while those\r\nbusy with powder and cartridges worked below, Pierre Braquond,\r\nthe turnkey, took this task upon himself, assisted by some of his\r\nlate prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of escaping from the island was great, for the insurgents\r\nwould fire on fugitives from the right bank of the river, the Versailles\r\ntroops from the left. A warder, at the risk of his life, crept to\r\nthe water's edge opposite to the Versaillais, and waved a white\r\nhandkerchief. As soon as he was seen, the troops ceased firing.\r\nEvery moment it was expected that the roof of the prison would\r\nfall in, when suddenly the reservoir on the top of the building\r\ngave way, and the flames were checked by a rush of water. Braquond\r\nhad said to Judge Bonjean a few days before he was sent from the\r\nPrefecture to Mazas, \"I can stay here no longer. I am going to\r\nescape to Versailles.\" M. Bonjean replied: \"As a magistrate I command\r\nyou to remain; as a prisoner I implore you. What would become of\r\nthose under your care if the friends of the Commune were set over\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Marine (that is, the Navy Department) is situated\r\nin the Rue Saint-Florentin, near the Rue Royale and the Place de\r\nla Concorde,--the most beautiful part of the city. The officer who\r\nheld it for the Commune was Colonel Brunei, an excellent middle-aged\r\nman, far too good for his associations. There was no stain of any\r\nkind on his past life, but he had been disappointed when peace\r\nwas made with the Germans, and had joined the Commune in a moment\r\nof patriotic enthusiasm. Once in its service, there was no way\r\nto escape.\r\n\r\nOn May 23 the Versaillais were gaining every moment. There was a\r\nman named Matillion, charged by the Central Committee to do anything\r\nor to burn anything to prevent their advance. That night, when\r\nhouses that he had set on fire were blazing in the Rue Royale (he\r\nhad had petroleum pumped upon them by fire-engines), there was a\r\nfierce orgy held by the light of the flames before the Church of\r\nthe Madeleine. A wild, demon-like dance was led by three women\r\nwho had done duty all day as _pétroleuses_,--Florence, Aurore,\r\nand Marie. Marie had been publicly thanked at the Hôtel-de-Ville\r\nfor sending a cannonball through one of the statues before the\r\nChamber of Deputies.\r\n\r\nThree battalions of Communist soldiers stationed in the Ministry\r\nof Marine, which had been converted into a hospital, took advantage\r\nof the fact that the general attention was fixed upon this orgy to\r\nquit their post and steal away, leaving the Ministry undefended.\r\nIt was eleven at night; Colonel Brunel was sending to the Central\r\nCommittee for fresh soldiers and fresh orders, when a paper was\r\ngiven him. He read it, turned pale, and sent for the doctor. \"The\r\nCentral Committee,\" he said, \"orders me to blow up this building\r\nimmediately.\" \"But my wounded?\" cried the doctor. There were one\r\nhundred and seven wounded soldiers of the Commune in the hospital.\r\nThere was no place to which they could be moved, and no means of\r\ntransportation. Colonel Brunel sent an orderly to represent the\r\ncase to the Committee. All he could obtain was a detail of National\r\nGuards to assist in carrying away the wounded, together with a\r\npositive order to burn down the building. As the sick men were\r\nbeing very slowly carried out, a party arrived, commanded by a\r\ndrunken officer, and carrying buckets of coal-oil and other\r\ncombustibles, which they scattered about the rooms. By this time\r\nthe fires of the Versaillais gleamed through the trees in the Champs\r\nÉlysées. The Rue Royale, near at hand, was in flames. Across the\r\nSeine, the Rue de Lille was burning. The Ministry of Finance and\r\nthe palace of the Tuileries seemed a sea of flame. In the Ministry\r\nof Marine were two clerks, long attached to that branch of the\r\nGovernment service, who had been requested by Admiral Pothereau,\r\nthe Minister for Naval Affairs, to remain at their post and endeavor\r\nto protect the papers and property. Their names were Gablin and Le\r\nSage. M. Le Sage had his wife with him in the building. These men\r\nresolved to save the Ministry, or perish. While Le Sage, who was\r\nexpert in gymnastics, set out to see if he could reach the general\r\nin command of the Versaillais, Gablin turned all his energies to\r\nprevent the impending conflagration. Putting on an air of haste and\r\nterror, he rushed into the room where the soldiers were refreshing\r\nthemselves, and cried out lustily that the Versaillais were upon them,\r\nbut that if they followed him, he would save them. Under pretence\r\nof showing them a secret passage, he led them into a chamber and\r\nlocked the door. Then he turned his attention to their commander.\r\nHe represented to him that the Versaillais were close at hand, and\r\npromised him safety and a handsome reward if he would not set fire\r\nto the building. \"But I have my orders!\" objected the half-tipsy\r\nofficer. \"I have the order you had better obey,\" replied Gablin,\r\npointing a pistol at his head. \"Now, shall I fire, or shall I reward\r\nyou?\" The officer gave in. He helped M. Gablin to pour the buckets\r\nof coal-oil into the gutters in the courtyard, to clear away the\r\npowder, and to drench the floors with water. Then Gablin took him\r\nto a chamber, gave him plain clothes, and locked him in. He fell\r\nasleep upon the bed in a moment.\r\n\r\nLe Sage meanwhile had made his way over the roofs of neighboring\r\nhouses, and then descended to the Champs Élysées. He was arrested\r\nseveral times by sentries, but at last made his way to General\r\nDouai. The general heard his story, and then put a paper into his\r\nhand, saying, \"The Ministry of Marine is already ours.\" Admiral\r\nPothereau himself, at three o'clock in the morning, was looking\r\ntowards his old offices and residence from the Champs Élysées.\r\nHe remarked to an aide-de-camp and to another officer: \"All looks\r\nvery quiet. Suppose we go and reconnoitre, and see how near we\r\ncan approach my official home.\" They held their swords in their\r\nhands, and, followed by three gendarmes, cautiously drew near the\r\nMinistry. They met with no opposition, and finally walked in. \"Where's\r\nLe Sage?\" was the admiral's first question. \"He is out looking\r\nfor you, M. le Ministre,\" cried Le Sage's wife, shedding tears of\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nThus the Ministry of Marine was captured by the minister; but the\r\nbuilding itself and all its valuable documents had been preserved\r\nby the fidelity of two young men.\r\n\r\nAs for the Communist officer, when he came to himself he sincerely\r\nrepented his connection with the Commune. He was pardoned, became\r\na respectable citizen, and found a true friend in M. Gablin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT REVENGE.\r\n\r\nThe Commune cost Paris fourteen thousand lives. Eight thousand\r\npersons were executed; six thousand were killed in open fight.\r\nBefore the siege Paris had contained two million and a quarter\r\nof inhabitants: she had not half that number during the Commune,\r\nnotwithstanding the multitude of small proprietors and peasants\r\nwho had flocked thither from devastated homes.\r\n\r\nMonday, May 29, found the city in the hands of the Versaillais.\r\nThe Provisional Government and its Parliament were victorious. The\r\narmy, defeated at Sedan, had conquered its insurgent countrymen.\r\nAll that remained of the Commune was wreck and devastation. The\r\nTuileries, the Column of the Place Vendôme, the Treasury, the Palace\r\nof the Legion of Honor, and the Hôtel-de-Ville, or City Hall, were\r\ndestroyed, besides two theatres, the Law Courts, or Palais de Justice,\r\nthe offices of the Council of State and the Court of Accounts,\r\nthe State Safe Deposit (Caisse des Dépôts et de Consignations),\r\nthe Library of the Louvre, the manufactory of Gobelin's tapestry,\r\nthe Prefecture of Police, eight whole streets, and innumerable\r\nscattered private houses. The vengeance of the soldiers as they\r\nmade their way from street to street, from barricade to barricade,\r\nwas savage and indiscriminate. Every man arrested whose hands were\r\nblack with powder was carried to a street corner or a courtyard,\r\nand summarily shot. Of course many wholly innocent persons perished,\r\nfor the troops of the Commune had been of two kinds,--the National\r\nGuard and the Volunteers. Most of the latter were devils incarnate.\r\nAmong them were the _Vengeurs de Flourens_, who were foremost in\r\nexecutions, and bands called by such names as _Les Enfants du Père\r\nDuchêne_ and _Les Enfants Perdus_. The National Guards were of\r\nthree classes,--genuine Communists, workmen whose pay was their\r\nonly resource for the support of their families, and pressed men,\r\nforced to fight, of whom there were a great many.\r\n\r\nI have before me three narratives written by gentlemen who either\r\nsuffered or participated in the Great Revenge. One was a resident\r\nin Paris who had taken no part either for or against the Commune;\r\none had served it on compulsion as a soldier; and one was an officer\r\nof the Versailles army, who on May 21 led his troops through a breach\r\ninto the city, and fought on till May 27, when all was over.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that such accounts of personal experience in troubled\r\ntimes give a far more vivid picture of events than a mere formal\r\nnarration. I therefore quote them in this chapter in preference\r\nto telling the story in my own words.\r\n\r\nThe first is by Count Joseph Orsi,[1] whose visit to Raoul Rigault's\r\noffice at the Prefecture of Police has already been told. He was\r\nleft unmolested by the Commune, most probably because in early\r\nlife he had been a member of those secret societies in Italy to\r\nwhich Louis Napoleon himself belonged. He says,--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Published in Fraser's Magazine, 1879.]\r\n\r\n\"On May 22 Paris was entering the last stage of its death struggle.\r\nThe army of Versailles had entered it from four different points.\r\nThe fight was desperate. Barricades were erected in almost every\r\nstreet. Prisoners on both sides were shot in scores at the\r\nstreet-corners. Three of the largest houses in the Rue Royale,\r\nwhere I lived, were on fire. Soldiers of the regular army were\r\nbeginning to appear in our quarter, and early on Thursday, May 25,\r\nI heard the bell of my apartment ring violently. I opened it, and\r\nfound myself face to face with twelve _voltigeurs_ of the Versailles\r\narmy; commanded by a lieutenant, who ordered the soldiers to search\r\nthe house and shoot any one wearing a uniform. He told me that\r\nhe must occupy my drawing-room, which looked on the Rue Royale,\r\nfor the purpose of firing on the insurgents, who were holding a\r\nbarricade where the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré joins the Rue\r\nRoyale. My wife was seated on her sofa. He ordered her to leave\r\nthe room. She resisted, and was removed by force. The soldiers then\r\nbegan firing on the insurgents from the windows. The insurgents\r\nhad possession of the upper floors of some houses facing mine, and\r\nfired with such effect that the soldiers were driven from their\r\nposition. The officer withdrew his men from the drawing-room and\r\nasked for a map of Paris, for he did not know exactly where he\r\nwas. I made a friend of him by pointing to my pictures, everyone\r\nof which proved me to be a friend and follower of the emperor. He\r\nasked me if I had any wine to give his men, who had had nothing\r\nto eat or drink since the previous night. While they were partaking\r\nof bread and wine in the kitchen, and I was talking with the officer\r\nin the dining-room, a shot fired from across the street struck the\r\nofficer on the temple. He fell as if struck dead. His soldiers\r\nrushed in and seized me. They were about to shoot me on the spot,\r\nwhen luckily my servant, with water and vinegar, brought the officer\r\nto his senses, so that he could raise his hand and make a sign to\r\nthe soldiers, who had me fast by both my arms, to keep quiet. By\r\nGod's mercy the officer had only been stunned. He had been hit,\r\nnot by a bullet, but by a piece of brick forced out of the wall by\r\na shot. I was released, but the soldiers were far from satisfied,\r\nbelieving their officer had accepted this explanation only to spare\r\nmy life. They left my house at nightfall, and afterwards the fire\r\nof the insurgents became so hot that the front wall of the house\r\nfell in, and everything I had was smashed to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning, May 26, as I was searching for some valuable\r\npapers among the ruins, two men in plain clothes entered and ordered\r\nme to follow them to the Prefecture of Police, temporarily located\r\non the Quai d'Orsay. As Paris was by this time completely under\r\nmilitary rule I was examined by an officer. I told him that, not\r\nknowing for what purpose I was wanted, I had left my papers at\r\nhome, and was sent under charge of two men to fetch them. I was\r\nalso given to understand that I had better make any arrangements\r\nI thought necessary for my wife, which led me to think it probable\r\nI should be shot or imprisoned. It was a reign of terror of a new\r\nkind, of which I could never have expected to be a victim. As we\r\nwere crossing the Place de la Concorde we saw half a dozen soldiers\r\nwho had seized four Federals on the barricade close by. A struggle\r\nwas going on for life or death. The soldiers, having at last the\r\nupper hand, strove to drag the Federals to the wall of the Ministry\r\nof Marine to be shot. The poor wretches were imploring for mercy,\r\nand refused to stand erect. Seeing this, the soldiers shot them\r\none after the other as they lay upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"I was finally disposed of, in company with other prisoners, in\r\nsome large stables and carriage houses. Some of us were in plain\r\nclothes, some in uniform. We were all packed together so closely\r\nthat there was not even the possibility of lying down upon the\r\nstones. Bread and water alone were given us. On the approach of\r\nnight we were shut in like cattle, with the intimation that any\r\nattempt to revolt or escape would be followed by instant execution.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning, May 27, at dawn, ten soldiers, with an officer\r\nat their head, began calling by name eight or ten prisoners at a\r\ntime from one of our places of confinement, and they were dragged\r\naway, God knows where. Utter dejection and despair were depicted\r\non the face of every man, especially on those who had been seized\r\non the barricades or in uniform. That afternoon I was called out,\r\nbeing part of a batch of nine prisoners, mostly in plain clothes.\r\nOn that day rain fell incessantly. We thought as we marched through\r\nthe mud and drizzle that we were going to be shot _en masse_ without\r\nany further trial; but on reaching the Champ de Mars, our escort\r\nwas ordered to take us to the barracks that are near it. There\r\nour names were taken down by an officer, and we were locked up\r\nin a room where seven other prisoners had already been confined.\r\nIt would be too horrible to relate the filth and closeness of that\r\nplace, which might have held seven or eight people, and we were\r\nsixteen! There was a board fitted between two walls where seven\r\npeople could lie. This was appropriated before we got there. We\r\nwere forced to stand up or to lie down on the stones, which were\r\ndamp and inexpressibly dirty. We remained thus for two days. On the\r\n29th the door opened at seven A. M. Eight soldiers were drawn up\r\noutside. The sergeant called out one of the prisoners named Lefevre,\r\nwho wore a National Guard's uniform. The poor fellow stepped out\r\nbetween the two lines of soldiers, and the door closed on him.\r\nHe was taken before the colonel, who was instructed to examine the\r\nprisoners, and had the discretionary power of ordering them to\r\nbe shot on the spot, or of sending them to Versailles to appear\r\nbefore the superior commission, by whom they were either set at\r\nliberty or sentenced to transportation. Poor Lefevre was not heard\r\nof again. We thought we heard a brisk volley of musketry in the\r\nlarge courtyard, but we had been so accustomed to such noises that\r\nit did not attract general attention. Later in the day another\r\nprisoner was called out in the same manner, and he came back no\r\nmore; this time the noise of the discharge was distinct, and made\r\nus alive to the imminence of our fate. On the third prisoner being\r\ncalled out, he refused to go. Two soldiers had to take him by force.\r\nHe fought desperately for his life. The door was shut. We had not\r\nlong to wait; the discharge of musketry re-echoed in our cell, and\r\ncaused within it such a scene of despair as baffles description.\r\n\r\n\"Next day four men were taken out and executed, which reduced our\r\nnumber to nine. By this time we had recovered from the shots and\r\nheeded little what was going to take place, as every one of us\r\nhad bidden adieu to this world and made his peace with God.\r\n\r\n\"On May 31 our door was opened again. Twelve soldiers were drawn\r\nup before it. We were all ordered out. We thought we were going to\r\nbe shot _en masse_, to make quicker work of us. To my amazement,\r\nwe saw a large column of about four hundred prisoners, four abreast,\r\nbetween two lines of grenadiers. Evidently we were intended to\r\nform the last contingent to it. The soldiers having been drawn\r\nup in two long lines on both sides of the column, an officer drew\r\nhis sword, and standing up on a wine-hogshead, shouted: 'Soldiers,\r\nload arms.' This being done, he added: 'Fire on any prisoner who\r\nattempts to revolt or escape.'\r\n\r\n\"We then took the road to the Western Railroad, where we were put\r\ninto cattle vans and goods vans, with scarcely room to breathe,\r\nand reached Versailles about six P. M. A detachment of soldiers\r\nescorted us to Satory. The column marched in to the artillery depot,\r\nand the gates were closed. I happened to be the right-hand man of\r\nthe four last prisoners in the column, so that I stood only three\r\nor four yards from the officer in command of the place, who stood\r\nlooking at the prisoners, with his arms folded and his officers\r\nbeside him. I saw him staring at me, which I attributed to my being\r\nthe best-dressed man of the party. Presently he walked slowly up\r\nto me, and measuring me from head to foot with what I took to be\r\na diabolical sneer, cried, 'Ho! Ho! the ribbon of the Legion of\r\nHonor! You got it, I suppose, on the barricades!' With that I felt\r\na sharp pull at my coat. Quick as thought, I brought my hand down,\r\nand caught his firmly as he was trying to tear the ribbon from\r\nmy breast. In my agitated state of mind I had not been aware I\r\nwas wearing a coat that had it on. 'You may shoot me, Captain,'\r\nI said, 'but you shall not wrest that ribbon from me.' 'Where did\r\nyou get it?' 'The prince president of the Republic, Louis Napoleon,\r\ngave it me.' 'When?' 'On September 23, 1853.' 'How is it, then,\r\nthat you were arrested? Was it on a barricade?' 'No, Captain, in\r\nmy own apartment. It is not likely I should fight for the Commune\r\nafter having been a devoted friend of the emperor for forty years.'\r\n'Your name?' 'Count Joseph Orsi.' He looked at me again, and having\r\njoined his officers, to whom he related what had taken place, he\r\nturned round and in a loud voice said to me: 'Come out of the ranks.'\r\nThen, seeing a gendarme close by, he said: 'Do not lose sight of\r\nthis prisoner.'\"\r\n\r\nFor two days the captain kept Count Orsi in his office and encouraged\r\nhim to write to any friends he might have in Versailles. Count Orsi\r\nnamed M. Grévy (afterwards president) as having been for years his\r\nlegal adviser, and he wrote a few lines to various other persons.\r\nBut there were no posts, and in the confusion of Versailles at\r\nthat moment there seemed little chance that his notes would reach\r\ntheir destination. Two days later an order came to Satory to send\r\nall prisoners to Versailles, and the kind-hearted captain was forced\r\nto return Count Orsi to the column of his fellow-prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt Versailles they were shut up in the wine-cellars of the palace,\r\nforty-five feet underground. The prisoners confined there were\r\nthe very dregs and scum of the insurrection. The cellars had only\r\nsome old straw on the floors, left there by the Prussians. There\r\nwere six hundred men confined in this place, and the torture they\r\nendured from the close air, the filth, and the impossibility of\r\nlying down at night was terrible.\r\n\r\nCount Orsi was ten days in this horrible prison. At last one evening\r\nhe heard his name called. His release had come. On going to the\r\ndoor he was taken before a superior officer, who expressed surprise\r\nand regret at the mistake that had been committed, and at once\r\nset him at liberty. A brave little boy, charged with one of his\r\nnotes, had persevered through all kinds of difficulties in putting\r\nit into the hands of the English lady to whom it was addressed.\r\nThis lady and the Italian ambassador had effected Count Orsi's\r\nrelease. He was ill with low fever for some weeks in consequence\r\nof the bad air he had breathed during his confinement. Subsequently\r\nhe discovered that personal spite had caused his arrest as a friend\r\nof the Commune.\r\n\r\nMy next account of those days is drawn from the experience of the\r\nMarquis de Compiègne,[1] one of the Versailles officers. He was\r\ntravelling in Florida when the Franco-Prussian war broke out, but\r\nhastened home at once to join the army. He fought at Sedan and was\r\ntaken prisoner to Germany, but returned in time to act against\r\nthe Commune. Afterwards he became an explorer in the Soudan, and\r\nin 1877 was killed in a duel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: His narrative was published in the \"Supplément Littéraire\r\ndu Figaro.\"]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of May, news having reached Versailles that the first\r\ndetachment of regular troops had made their way into Paris, M.\r\nde Compiègne hastened to join his battalion, which he had that\r\nmorning quitted on a few hours' leave. As they approached the Bois\r\nde Boulogne at midnight, the sky over Paris seemed red with flame.\r\nThey halted for some hours, the men sleeping, the officers amusing\r\nthemselves by guessing conundrums; but as day dawned, they entered\r\nParis through a breach in the defences. The young officer says,--\r\n\r\n\"I shall never forget the sight. The fortifications had been riddled\r\nwith balls; the casemates were broken in. All over the ground were\r\nstrewn haversacks, packets of cartridges, fragments of muskets,\r\nscraps of uniforms, tin cans that had held preserved meats,\r\nammunition-wagons that had been blown up, mangled horses, men dying\r\nand dead, artillerymen cut down at their guns, broken gun-carriages,\r\ndisabled siege-guns, with their wheels splashed red from pools of\r\nblood, but still pointed at our positions, while around were the\r\nstill smoking walls of ruined private houses. A company of infantry\r\nwas guarding about six hundred prisoners, who with folded arms and\r\nlowering faces were standing among the ruins. They were of all\r\nages, grades, and uniforms,--boys of fifteen and old men, general\r\nofficers covered with gold lace, and beggars in rags: Avengers of\r\nFlourens, Children of Père Duchêne, Chasseurs and Zouaves, Lascars,\r\nTurcos, and Hussars. We halted a little farther in the city. We\r\nwere very hungry, but all the shops were closed. I got some milk,\r\nbut some of my comrades, who wanted wine, made a raid into the\r\ncellar of an abandoned house, and were jumped upon by an immense\r\nnegro dressed like a Turco, whom they took for the devil. Glad as\r\nwe all were to be in Paris, the sight as we marched on was most\r\nmelancholy. Fighting seemed going on in all directions, especially\r\nnear the Tuileries and the Place de la Concorde. The Arch of Triumph\r\nwas not seriously injured. On the top of it were two mortars, and\r\nthe tricolored flag had been replaced by the _drapeau rouge_.\r\nDetachments were all the time passing us with prisoners. They were\r\nthrust for safe-keeping wherever space could be found. I am sorry\r\nto say that they were cruelly insulted, and, as usual, those who\r\nhad fought least had the foulest tongues. There was one party of\r\ndeserters still in uniform, with their coats turned inside out. I\r\nsaw one of the prettiest girls I have ever seen, among the prisoners.\r\nShe was about fourteen, dressed as a _cantinière_, with a red scarf\r\nround her waist. A smile was on her lips, and she carried herself\r\nproudly.\r\n\r\n\"That morning, May 22, I saw nobody shot. I think they wanted to\r\ntake all the prisoners they could to Versailles as trophies of\r\nvictory. About one o'clock we received orders to march, and went\r\ndown the Boulevard Malesherbes. All the inhabitants seemed to be at\r\ntheir windows, and in many places we were loudly welcomed. It was\r\nstrange to me to be marching with arms in my hands, powder-stained\r\nand dirty, along streets I had so often trodden gay, careless, and\r\nin search of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"On the march we passed the Carmelite Convent, where my sister\r\nwas at school; and as we halted, I was able to run in a moment and\r\nsee her. Only an hour or two before; the nuns had had a Communist\r\npicket in their yard.\r\n\r\n\"We marched on to the Parc Monceau [once Louis Philippe's private\r\npleasure-garden]. There our men were shooting prisoners who had\r\nbeen taken with arms in their hands. I saw fifteen men fall,--and\r\nthen a woman.\r\n\r\n\"That night volunteers were called for to defend an outlying barricade\r\nwhich had been taren from the insurgents, and of which they were\r\nendeavoring to regain possession. Our captain led a party to this\r\nplace, and in a tall house that overlooked the barricade he stationed\r\nthree of us. There, lying flat on our faces on a billiard-table, we\r\nexchanged many shots with the enemy. A number of National Guards\r\ncame up and surrendered to us as prisoners. As soon as one presented\r\nhimself with the butt of his musket in the air, we made him come\r\nunder the window, where two of us stood ready to fire in case of\r\ntreachery, while the third took him to the lieutenant. In the course\r\nof the night I was slightly wounded in the ear. A surgeon pinned\r\nit up with two black pins.\r\n\r\n\"It was now May 23,--an ever-memorable day. We were pushing on\r\ninto Paris, and were to attack Montmartre; but first we had to make\r\nsure of the houses in our rear. Then began that terrible fighting in\r\nthe streets, when every man fights hand to hand, when one must jump,\r\nrevolver in hand, into dark cellars, or rush up narrow staircases\r\nwith an enemy who knows the ground, lying in wait. Two or three\r\nshots, well aimed, come from one house, and each brings down a\r\ncomrade. Exasperated, we break in the door and rush through the\r\nchambers. The crime must be punished, the murderers are still on\r\nthe spot; but there are ten men in the house. Each swears that\r\nhe is innocent. Then each soldier has to take upon himself the\r\noffice of a judge. He looks to see if the gun of each man has been\r\ndischarged recently, if the blouse and the citizen's trousers have\r\nnot been hastily drawn over a uniform. Death and life are in his\r\nhands; no one will ever call him to account for his decision. Women\r\nand children fall at his feet imploring pity; through all the house\r\nresound sobs, groans, and the reports of rifles. At the corner of\r\nevery street lie the bodies of men shot, or stand prisoners about\r\nto be executed.\r\n\r\n\"I was thankful when the moment came to attack the heights of\r\nMontmartre, and to engage in open warfare. General Pradié, our\r\nbrigadier-general, marched at our head, greatly exposed, because\r\nof the gold lace on his uniform. An insurgent, whom we had taken\r\nprisoner, suddenly sprang from his guards, seized the general's\r\nhorse, and presented at him a revolver that he had hidden in his\r\nbelt. The general, furious, cried, 'Shoot him! shoot him!' But we\r\ndared not, they were too close together. Suddenly the man sprang\r\nback, gained the street, and though twenty of us fired in haste\r\nat once, every ball missed him. Leaping like a goat, he made his\r\nescape. The general was very angry. Step by step we made our way,\r\nslowly, it is true, but never losing ground. About two hundred\r\nyards from Montmartre were tall houses and wood-yards where many\r\ninsurgents had taken refuge. These sent among us a shower of balls.\r\nWe had sharp fighting in this place, but succeeded in gaining the\r\nposition. Then we halted for about two hours, to make preparations\r\nfor an attack upon the heights. Some of us while we halted, fired\r\nat the enemy, some raided houses and made prisoners; some went in\r\nsearch of something to eat, but seldom found it. I was fortunate,\r\nhowever, while taking some prisoners to the provost-marshal, to\r\nbe able to buy a dozen salt herrings, four pints of milk, nine\r\nloaves of bread, some prunes, some barley-sugar, and a pound of\r\nbacon. I took all I could get, and from the colonel downward, all my\r\ncomrades were glad to get a share of my provisions. The heights of\r\nMontmartre had been riddled by the fire from Mont Valérien. Sometimes\r\na shell from our mortars would burst in the enemy's trenches, when\r\na swarm of human beings would rush out of their holes and run like\r\nrabbits in a warren.\"\r\n\r\nThe punishment of the unfortunate, as well as of the guilty, was\r\nvery severe. Their imprisonment in the Great Orangery at Versailles,\r\nwhere thousands of orange-trees are stored during the winter, involved\r\nfrightful suffering. A commission was appointed to try the prisoners,\r\nbut its work was necessarily slow. It was more than a year before\r\nsome of the captured leaders of the Commune met their fate. Those\r\ncondemned were shot at the Buttes of Satory,--an immense amphitheatre\r\nholding twenty thousand people, where the emperor on one of his fêtes,\r\nin the early days of his marriage, gave a great free hippodrome\r\nperformance, to the intense gratification of his lieges.\r\n\r\nSome prisoners were transported to New Caledonia; Cayenne had been\r\ngiven up as too unhealthy, and this lonely island in the far Pacific\r\nOcean had been fixed upon as the Botany Bay for political offenders.\r\nSome of the leaders in the Council of the Commune were shot in the\r\nstreets. Raoul Rigault was of this number. Some were executed at\r\nSatory; some escaped to England, Switzerland, and America; some\r\nwere sent to New Caledonia, but were amnestied, and returned to\r\nFrance to be thorns in the side of every Government up to the present\r\nhour; some are now legislators in the French Chamber, some editors\r\nand proprietors of newspapers. Among those shot in the heat of\r\nvengeance at Satory was Valin, who had vainly tried to save the\r\nhostages. Deleschuze, in despair at the cowardice of his associates,\r\nquietly sought a barricade when affairs grew desperate, and standing\r\non it with his arms folded, was shot down. Cluseret, who had real\r\ntalent as an artist, had an exhibition a few years since of his\r\npictures in Paris, and writing to a friend concerning it, speaks\r\nthus of himself:[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Le Figaro.]\r\n\r\n\"You can tell me the worst. When a man has passed through a life\r\nfull of vicissitudes as I have done, during seventeen years of\r\nwhich I have seen many campaigns, fighting sometimes three hundred\r\nand sixty-five days in a year, or marching and counter-marching,\r\nwithout tents or anything; when one has been three times outlawed\r\nand under sentence of death; when one has known much of imprisonment\r\nand exile; when one has suffered from ingratitude, calumny, and\r\npoverty,--one is pretty well seasoned, and can bear to hear the\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\nOne thousand and thirty-one women were among the prisoners at Versailles\r\nand Satory. Many of them were women of the worst character. Eight\r\nhundred and fifty were set at liberty; four were sent to an insane\r\nasylum; but doctors declared that nearly every woman who fought\r\nin the streets for the Commune was more or less insane.\r\n\r\nThe most important of all captures was that of Rochefort. He had\r\nbeen a leading man in the Council of the Commune, but was so great\r\na favorite with men of literature, besides having strong friends\r\nand an old schoolfellow in Thiers' cabinet, that he escaped with\r\ntransportation to the Southern Seas. On May 20, when he saw that\r\nthe end of the Commune was at hand, he procured from the Delegate\r\nfor Foreign Affairs passports for himself and his secretary. It\r\nis thought that the delegate, enraged at Rochefort's purpose of\r\ndeserting his colleagues, betrayed him to the Prussians who held\r\nthe fort of Vincennes. The Prussians sent word to the frontier,\r\nand there the fugitives were arrested. Rochefort had no luggage,\r\nbut in his pocket was a great deal of miscellaneous jewelry, a copy\r\nof \"Monte Cristo,\" and some fine cigars. Escorted by Uhlans, he\r\nwas brought to St. Germains, and delivered over to the Versailles\r\nGovernment. For a long time his fate hung in the balance, and it\r\nseemed improbable that even the exertions of M. Thiers, the President,\r\nand Jules Favre, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, could save him.\r\n\r\nHaving told of the last days of the Commune as seen by Count Orsi\r\nand the Marquis de Compiègne, there remains one more narrative,--the\r\nexperiences of a man still more intimately connected with the events\r\nof that terrible period, though, like a soldier in battle, he seems\r\nto have been able to see only what was around him, and could take\r\nno general view of what went on in other parts of the field.\r\n\r\nThe writer was all English gentleman who published his narrative\r\nimmediately after he returned to England in September and October,\r\n1871, in \"Macmillan's Magazine.\" \"The writer,\" says the editor, \"is\r\na young gentleman of good family and position. His name, though\r\nsuppressed for good reasons, is known to us, and we have satisfied\r\nourselves of the trustworthiness of the narrative.\" He says:\r\n\r\n\"I left England very hurriedly for France on March 29, 1871. I\r\nhad neglected to procure a passport, and had no papers to prove\r\nmy identity. I travelled from Havre to Paris without trouble, and\r\non the train met two men whom I saw afterwards as members of the\r\nCouncil of the Commune. The first thing that struck me on my arrival\r\nin Paris was the extreme quietness of the streets. During the first\r\nweek of my stay I was absorbed in my own business, and saw nothing;\r\nbut on Monday, April 10, my own part in the concerns of the Commune\r\nbegan. I was returning home from breakfast about one o'clock in\r\nthe day, when I met a sergeant and four men in the street, who\r\nstopped me, and the sergeant said: 'Pardon, Citizen, but what is\r\nyour battalion?' I answered that, being an Englishman, I did not\r\nbelong to any battalion. 'And your passport, Citizen?' On my replying\r\nthat I had none, he requested me to go with him to a neighboring\r\n_mairie_, and I was accordingly escorted thither by the four men.\r\nOn my arrival I was shown into a cell, comfortable enough, though\r\nit might have been cleaner. Having no evidence of my nationality,\r\nI felt it was useless to apply to the Embassy; all the friends I\r\nhad in Paris who could have identified me as all Englishman had\r\nleft the city some days before, and as I reflected, it appeared to\r\nme that if required to serve the Commune, no other course would\r\nbe left to me. One thing, however, I resolved,--to keep myself as\r\nmuch in the background as possible. In three or four hours I was\r\nconducted before the members of the Commune for that arrondissement.\r\nThey received me civilly, asked my name, age, profession, etc.,\r\nand then one of them, taking up a paper, proceeded to say that I\r\nmust be placed in a battalion for active service, as I was under\r\nforty years of age. 'Gentlemen,' I replied, 'your political affairs\r\nare of no interest to me, and it is my misfortune to be placed\r\nin this unpleasant predicament. But I tell you plainly, you may\r\nshoot me if you will, but I absolutely refuse to leave Paris to\r\nfight the Versaillais, who are no enemies of mine in particular,\r\nand I therefore demand to be set at liberty.' Upon this they all\r\nlaughed, and told me to leave the room. After a little time I was\r\nrecalled, and told I should be placed in a _compagnie sédentaire_.\r\nI again remonstrated, and demanded to be set at liberty, when they\r\nsaid I was drunk, and ordered me to be locked into my cell, whence\r\nI was transferred to my battalion the next morning. I found my\r\ncaptain a remarkably pleasant man, as indeed were all my comrades\r\nin my company, and I can never forget the kindness I met with from\r\nthem. My only regret is my utter ignorance of their fate. I can\r\nscarcely hope they all escaped the miserable fate that overtook\r\nso many; but I should rejoice to know that some were spared. On\r\nentering the captain's office and taking off my hat, I was told\r\nto put it on again, 'as we are all equal here, Citizen;' and after\r\nthe captain had said a few words to me, I was regaled with bread,\r\nsardines, and wine,--the rations for the day. The captain was a\r\nyoung man of six-and-twenty, with a particularly quiet, gentlemanly\r\nmanner (he was, I believe, a carpet-weaver). He had been a soldier,\r\nand had served in Africa with distinction.\r\n\r\n\"The account of my daily duties as a member of this company from\r\nApril 10 to May 23 may be here omitted. I became orderly to one of\r\nthe members of the Commune, and being supplied with a good horse\r\n(for as an Englishman I was supposed to be able to ride), I spent\r\nmuch of my time in carrying messages. On the morning of Tuesday,\r\nMay 23, our colonel told us of the death of Dombrowski, who had\r\nbeen shot during the night, though particulars were not known. I\r\nwas sorry to hear of his end, for he had been disposed to be kind\r\nto me, and I knew then that the cause of the Commune was utterly\r\nlost, as he was the only able man among them. The night before, we\r\nhad seen such a fire as I never saw before, streaming up to the\r\nsky in two pillars of flame. I was told it was the Tuileries. The\r\nVersaillais were already within the walls of Paris, but this we\r\nin the centre of the city did not know. The news spread during the\r\nday, however, and there was a great panic in the evening. Everybody\r\nbegan to make preparations for flight, the soldiers being anxious\r\nto get home and change their uniforms for plain clothes. No one\r\nknew with any degree of certainty where the enemy really was, nor\r\nhow far he had advanced; only one thing was certain, that the game\r\nwas played out, and that _sauve qui peut_ must be the order of the\r\nday. Men, women, and children were rushing frantically about the\r\nstreets, demanding news, and repeating it with a hundred variations.\r\nThe whole scene was lit up by fires which blazed in all directions.\r\nAt last the night gave place to dawn, and the scene was one to be\r\nremembered for a lifetime. The faces of the crowd wore different\r\nexpressions of horror, amazement, and abject terror.... Early in\r\nthe morning of Wednesday 24th, I, with some others, was ordered\r\nto the barricade of La Roquette.[1] My companions were very good\r\nfellows, with one exception,--a grumpy old wretch who had served\r\nin Africa, and could talk about nothing but the heat of Algeria\r\nand the chances for plunder he had let slip there. Finding nothing\r\nto do at the barricade, I tied my horse and fell asleep upon the\r\npavement. I dreamed I was at a great dinner-party in my father's\r\nhouse, and could get nothing to eat, though dishes were handed\r\nto me in due course. Many times afterwards my sleeping thoughts\r\ntook that direction. I really believe that there were times when\r\nI and many others would willingly have been shot, if we could have\r\nsecured one good meal, When I awoke, about mid-day, in the Rue de\r\nla Roquette, I found my companions gone to the _mairie_ of the\r\nEleventh Arrondissement, and I followed them. Our uniform was not\r\nunlike that of the troops of the line in the French army, so we\r\nwere taken by the crowd for deserters, and hailed with 'Ah, les\r\nbon garçons! Ah, les bons patriotes!' and we shouted back in turn\r\nwith all our might, 'Vive la Commune! Vive la République!' Those\r\nwords were in my mouth the whole of the next three days. The people\r\nnever saw a horseman without shrieking to him, 'How is all going on\r\nat present?' To which the answer was invariably, 'All goes well!\r\n_Vive la Commune! Vive la République!_' though the enemy might at\r\nthat moment be within five hundred yards. Indeed, the infatuation and\r\ncredulity displayed by the French, not only during the insurrection,\r\nbut the whole war, was absurd. Tell them on good authority that they\r\nhad lost a battle or been driven back, they would answer that you\r\nwere joking, and you might think yourself lucky to escape with a\r\nwhole skin; but say nothing but 'All goes well! We have won!' and\r\nwithout stopping to inquire, they would at once cheer and shout\r\nas if for a decisive victory.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At that time the execution of the hostages was taking\r\nplace within the prison.]\r\n\r\nThe next duty of our Englishman was to act as mounted orderly to\r\ncaptains who were ordered to visit and report on the state of the\r\nbarricades, also to command all citizens to go into their houses\r\nand close the doors and windows. There was little enthusiasm at\r\nthe barricades, and everywhere need of reinforcements. The army\r\nof the Commune was melting away. The most energetic officer they\r\nsaw was a stalwart negro lieutenant,--possibly the man who, as De\r\nCompiègne tells us, had scared some Versaillais in a cellar on\r\nthe 22d of May.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Thursday, May 25, the Column of July was a remarkable\r\nsight. It had been hung with wreaths of _immortelles_, and those caught\r\nfire from an explosive. Elsewhere, except for burning buildings,\r\nthere was total darkness. There was no gas in Paris, of course. And\r\nhere our Englishman goes on to say that so far as his experience\r\nwent, he saw no _pétroleuses_ nor fighting women, nor did he believe\r\nin their existence.\r\n\r\nBy Friday, May 26, provisions and fodder were exhausted, and it\r\nwas hard for the soldiers of the Commune to get anything to eat.\r\nOur Englishman, in the general disorganization, became separated\r\nfrom his comrades, and joined himself to a small troop of horsemen\r\nwearing the red shirt of Garibaldi, who swept past him at a furious\r\ngallop. They were making for the cemetery of Père la Chaise. \"All is\r\nlost!\" they cried. \"To get there is our only chance of safety.\" Yet\r\nthey still shouted to the men and women whom they passed, \"All goes\r\nwell! _Vive la Commune! Vive la République!_\" By help of an order to\r\nvisit all the posts, which the Englishman had in his pocket, they\r\nobtained admittance into Père la Chaise. There were five Poles in\r\nthe party, one Englishman, and one Frenchman; \"and certainly,\" adds\r\nthe narrator, \"they were no credit to their respective nations. It\r\nwas on their faces that I remarked for the first time that peculiar\r\nhunted-down look which was afterwards to be seen on every countenance,\r\nand I presume upon my own.\"\r\n\r\nOur Englishman rode up to a battery in Père la Chaise, planted on\r\nthe spot made famous by a celebrated passage in \"Le Père Goriot,\"\r\nin which Balzac describes Rastignac, on the eve of finally selling\r\nhimself to Satan, as standing and gazing down on Paris, to conquer\r\na high place in which is to be his reward. The observer who saw\r\nthe city from the same spot on the 26th of May, 1871, says,--\r\n\r\n\"Beneath me lay stretched out like a map the once great and beautiful\r\ncity, now, alas! given over a prey to fire and sword. I could see\r\nsmoke rising from many a heap of ruins that but a few short hours\r\nbefore had been a palace or a monument of art. It was impossible,\r\nhowever, to decide what buildings were actually burning, for a\r\nthick, misty rain had set in, which prevented my seeing distinctly.\r\nIn my descent I passed the place where the body of Dombrowski was\r\nlying. He had been shot from behind, and the ball had passed through\r\nhis body. At the gate of the cemetery I found a man waiting for\r\nme with news that Belleville was to be our _rendezvous_. Words\r\ncannot paint the spectacle that Belleville presented. It was the\r\nlast place left, the only refuge remaining; and such an assemblage\r\nas was collected there it would be difficult to find again. There\r\nwere National Guards of every battalion, _Chasseurs Fédérés_ in\r\ntheir wonderful uniform,--a sort of cross between Zouave, linesman,\r\nand rifleman,--_Enfants Perdus_ in their green coats and feathers\r\n(very few of these were to be seen, as they had no claim to quarter,\r\nnor did they expect any), _Chasseurs à Cheval_ of the Commune, in\r\ntheir blue jackets and red trousers, leaning idly against the gates\r\nof their stables, _Éclaireurs de la Commune_ in blue, Garibaldians in\r\nred, hussars, _cantinières_, sailors, civilians, women, and children,\r\nall mixed up together in the crowded streets, and looking the picture\r\nof anxiety. In the afternoon about four o'clock we were ordered to\r\nmount and to escort 'ces coquins,'--as the officer called a party\r\nof prisoners. They were forty-five gendarmes and six _curés_, who\r\nwere to be shot in the courtyard of a neighboring building. We\r\nobeyed our orders and accompanied them to their destination. I was\r\ntold off to keep back the crowd. The men about to die, fifty-one\r\nin all, were placed together, and the word was given to fire. Some\r\nfew, happier than the rest, fell at once, others died but slowly.\r\nOne gendarme made an effort to escape but was shot through the\r\nstomach, and fell, a hideous object, to the ground. One old _curé_,\r\nwith long hair white as snow, had the whole of one side of his head\r\nshot away, and still remained standing. After I had seen this, I\r\ncould bear it no longer, but, reckless of consequences, moved away\r\nand left the ground, feeling very sick. As I was in the act of\r\nleaving, I observed a lad, a mere boy of fourteen or fifteen, draw\r\na heavy horseman's pistol from his belt and fire in the direction\r\nof the dead and dying. He was immediately applauded by the mob, and\r\nembraced by those who stood near as 'a good patriot.' And here let\r\nme remark that those who have thought it cruel and inhuman on the\r\npart of the conquerors to arrest and detain as prisoners _gamins_\r\nof from twelve to sixteen, are quite mistaken. Those who remained\r\nat the barricades to the last, and were most obstinate in their\r\ndefence, were the boys of Paris. They were fierce and uncontrollable,\r\nand appeared to be veritably possessed of devils. The difference\r\nbetween the irregular corps and the National Guard was that the\r\nlatter had, with very few exceptions, been forced to serve, like\r\nmyself, under compulsion, or by the stern necessity of providing\r\nbread for their wives and children, while the Irregulars were all\r\nvolunteers, and had few married men in their ranks.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the day two mounted officers in plain clothes, one of\r\nthem a captain, whom our friend had served as orderly, called him\r\nand an artilleryman out of the ranks, and ordered them to accompany\r\nthem. After a devious course through obscure streets of Paris, the\r\nofficers gave them some money, and ordered them to go into the\r\nnext street and see if they could procure plain clothes. Having\r\ndone so, they returned to the place where their officers had promised\r\nto wait for them; but they had disappeared. This was, in truth, a\r\ngood-natured _ruse_ to save the lives of the two privates, though\r\nat the time it was not so understood. Not knowing what to do, they\r\nattempted to return to their regiments, but at the first outpost\r\nthey were challenged by the sentry. They had been away five hours,\r\nand the countersign had been changed. They were arrested, and carried\r\nto the nearest _mairie_. They were led upstairs and taken before\r\na member of the Commune who was sitting at a table covered with\r\npapers, busily writing, surrounded by men of all ranks and uniforms.\r\nOn hearing their story, he turned round, and said, in excellent\r\nEnglish, \"What are you doing here, an Englishman and in plain clothes?\"\r\nThe Englishman had grown angry. He answered recklessly: \"Yes, I\r\nam English, and I have been compelled to serve your Commune. I\r\ndon't know what your name is, or who you are, but I request that\r\nyou give me a paper to allow me to quit Paris without further\r\nmolestation.\" The member of the Commune smiled, and answered: \"There\r\nis only one thing to be done with you. Here, sergeant!\" And the\r\nEnglishman and the artilleryman were escorted to the guard-room.\r\nThere everything of value was taken from them. The Englishman lost\r\nhis watch, his money, and what he valued more, his note-book and\r\npapers. He wore a gold ring, the gift of his mother; and as it\r\nwas difficult to get off, some of the soldiers proposed amputating\r\nthe finger.\r\n\r\nNext, a species of court-martial was held, which in a few minutes\r\npassed sentence that they were to be shot at nine the next morning,\r\nfor \"refusing to serve the Commune!\" They had been asked no questions,\r\nno evidence had been heard, and no defence had been allowed them.\r\nSays the Englishman,--\r\n\r\n\"We were conducted to the Black Hole. There we found nine others\r\nwho were to suffer the same fate in the morning. I was too tired\r\nto do anything but throw myself on a filthy mattress, and in a\r\nfew minutes I was sleeping what I thought was my last sleep on\r\nearth. I was roused at daybreak by a tremendous hammering of my\r\ncompanions on the door of our cell. I was irritated, and asked\r\nangrily why they could not allow those who wished to be quiet to\r\nremain so. They answered by telling me to climb up to the window\r\nand look into the courtyard. I found it strewn with corpses. The\r\n_mairie_ had been evacuated during the night, and it was evident\r\nwe should not be executed. In vain we tried to force the door of\r\nour cell; all we could do was to make as much noise as possible\r\nto attract attention. At last a sergeant of the National Guard\r\nprocured the keys, the heavy door was opened, and we were free.\r\nI avoided a distribution of rifles and ammunition, and passed out\r\ninto the street, hoping that my troubles were over. Alas! they\r\nwere only just begun; for the first sight that met my eyes as I\r\nstepped into the street was a soldier of the Government, calling\r\non all those in sight to surrender and to lay down their arms. I\r\ngave myself up as a prisoner of war. It was Whit-Sunday, May 28.\r\nHappily my name was written down as one of those taken without\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"I was placed in a party of prisoners, and we were marched to the\r\nButtes de Chaumont, passing in our way many a barricade, or rather\r\nthe remains of them. Here, the body of a man shot through the head\r\nwas lying stiff and cold upon the pavement; there, was a pool of\r\ncoagulated blood; there, the corpse of a gentleman in plain clothes,\r\napparently sleeping, with his head buried in his arms; but a small\r\nred stream issuing from his body told that he slept the sleep of\r\ndeath. Some, as we marched on, kept silence, some congratulated\r\nthemselves that all was over, while some predicted our immediate\r\nexecution. All had the same hunted-down, wearied look upon their\r\nfaces that I have before alluded to. At last we were halted and\r\ngiven over to the charge of a regiment of the line. The first order\r\ngiven was, 'Fling down your hats!' Luckily I had a little silk cap,\r\nwhich I contrived to slip into my pocket, and which was afterwards\r\nof great comfort to me. We stood bare-headed in the blazing sun\r\nsome time, till our attention was called to a sound of shooting,\r\nand a whisper went round: 'We are all to be shot.' The agonized\r\nlook on the faces of some, I can never forget; but these were men\r\nof the better sort, and few in number: the greater part looked\r\nsullen and stolid, shrugged their shoulders, and said, 'It won't\r\ntake long; a shot, and all is over.'\r\n\r\n\"A boy about four files behind me was a pitiable object; his cries\r\nand his frantic endeavors to attract notice to a document of some\r\nsort he held in his hand, were silenced at last by a kick from\r\nan officer and a 'Tais-toi, crapaud!' Very different was it with\r\na poor child of nine, who stood next to me. He never cried nor\r\nuttered a word of complaint, but stood quietly by my side for some\r\ntime, looking furtively into my face. At last he ventured to slip\r\nhis little hand into mine, and from that time till the close of\r\nthat terrible day we marched hand in hand. Meantime the executions\r\nwent on. I counted up to twenty, and afterwards I believe some\r\nsix or seven more took place. Those put to death were nearly all\r\nofficers of the National Guard. One who was standing near me, a\r\npaymaster, had his little bag containing the pay of his men, which\r\nhe had received the day before, but had not been able to distribute\r\namong them. He now gave it away to those standing round him (I among\r\nthem getting a few francs), saying, 'I shall be shot; but this money\r\nmay be of use to you, my children, in your sad captivity.' He was led\r\nout and shot a few minutes afterwards. They all, without exception,\r\nmet their fate bravely and like men. There was no shrinking from\r\ndeath, or entreaties to be spared, among those I saw killed.\r\n\r\n\"After an hour we resumed our march, the mob saluting us with the\r\nchoicest selection of curses and abusive epithets I ever heard.\r\nWe passed down the Rue Royale, the bystanders calling on us to\r\nlook upon the ruin we had caused, through the Champs Élysées to\r\nthe Arch of Triumph, marching bare-headed, under a burning sun.\r\nAt length, in the Avenue de l'Impératrice, an order to halt was\r\ngiven. There, weary and footsore, many dropped down on the ground,\r\nwaiting for death, which we were now convinced was near at hand. For\r\nmyself, I felt utterly numbed and contented to die, and I think I\r\nshould have received with equal indifference the news of my release.\r\nI remember plotting in my mind how I could possibly get news of my\r\nfate conveyed to my parents in England. Could I ask one of the\r\nsoldiers to convey a message for me? And would he understand what\r\nto do? With such thoughts, and mechanically repeating the Lord's\r\nPrayer to myself at intervals, I whiled away more than an hour,\r\nuntil an order, 'Get up, all of you,' broke the thread of my\r\nmeditations. Presently General the Marquis de Gallifet (he who\r\nhad served the emperor in Mexico) passed slowly down the line,\r\nattended by several officers. He stopped here and there, selecting\r\nseveral of our number, chiefly the old or the wounded, and ordered\r\nthem to step out of the ranks. His commands were usually couched in\r\nabusive language. A young man near me called out, 'I am an American.\r\nHere is my passport. I am innocent.' 'Silence! We have foreigners\r\nand riff-raff more than enough. We have got to get rid of them,'\r\nwas the general's reply. All chance was over now, we thought; we\r\nshould be shot in a few minutes. Our idea was that those who had\r\nbeen placed aside were to be spared, and those about me said: 'It\r\nis just. They would not shoot the aged and the wounded!' Alas! we\r\nwere soon to be undeceived. Again we started, and were ordered to\r\nmarch arm in arm to the Bois de Boulogne. There those picked out\r\nof our ranks by General de Gallifet--over eighty in number--were\r\nall shot before our eyes; yet so great was our thirst that many,\r\nwhile the shooting was going on, were struggling for water, of\r\nwhich there was only a scant supply. I was not fortunate enough\r\nto get any.\r\n\r\n\"The execution being over, we proceeded, now knowing that our\r\ndestination was Versailles. Oh, the misery and wretchedness of\r\nthat weary march! The sun poured fiercely down on our uncovered\r\nheads, our throats were parched with thirst, our blistered feet\r\nand tired legs could hardly support our aching bodies. Now and\r\nagain a man utterly worn out would drop by the wayside. One of our\r\nguard would then dismount, and try by kicks and blows to make him\r\nresume his place in the line. In all cases those measures proved\r\nunavailing, and a shot in the rear told us that one of our number\r\nhad ceased to exist. The executioner would then fall into his place,\r\nlaughing and chatting gayly with his comrades.\r\n\r\n\"Towards eight o'clock in the evening we entered Versailles. If\r\nthe curses we had endured in Paris were frightful and numerous,\r\nhere they were multiplied tenfold. We toiled up the hill leading to\r\nSatory, through mud ankle deep. 'There stand the _mitrailleuses_,\r\nready for us,' said one of my companions. Then, indeed, for the\r\nfirst time I felt afraid, and wished I had been among those who had\r\nbeen executed in the daytime, rather than be horribly wounded and\r\nlinger in my misery; for no sure aim is taken by a _mitrailleuse_.\r\n\r\n\"The order came to halt, and I waited for the whirring sound; but,\r\nthank God! I waited in vain. We set ourselves in motion once more,\r\nand soon were in an immense courtyard surrounded by walls, having\r\non one side large sheds in which we were to pass the night. With\r\nwhat eagerness did we throw ourselves on our faces in the mud, and\r\nlap up the filthy water in the pools! There was another Englishman,\r\nas well as several Americans, among our number, also some Dutch,\r\nBelgians, and Italians. The Englishman had arrived in Paris from\r\nBrest on May 14 to 'better himself,' and had been immediately arrested\r\nand put in prison by the Commune. Being released on the 21st of\r\nMay, he was captured the next day by the Versaillais. I remained\r\nall the time with him till my release.\r\n\r\n\"On Wednesday, May 31, we were despatched to Versailles to be examined\r\nat the _orangerie_. The _orangerie_ is about seven hundred feet long\r\nand forty broad, including two wings at either end. It is flagged\r\nwith stone, on which the dust accumulates in great quantities.\r\nAccording to my experience, it is bitterly cold at night, and very hot\r\nin the daytime. Within its walls, instead of fragrant orange-trees,\r\nwere four to five thousand human beings, now herded together in a\r\ncondition too miserable to imagine, a prey to vermin, disease,\r\nand starvation.\r\n\r\n\"The general appearance of the crowd of captives was, I must confess,\r\nfar from prepossessing. They were very dirty, very dusty and worn\r\nout, as I myself was probably, and no wonder; the floor was several\r\ninches thick in dust, no straw was attainable, and washing was\r\nimpossible. I gained some comparative comfort by gathering up dust\r\nin a handkerchief and making a cushion of it. Thursday, June 1,\r\ndragged on as miserably as its predecessor, the only event being\r\nthe visit of a deputy, which gave rise to great anticipations, as\r\nhe said, in my hearing, that our condition was disgraceful, and\r\nthat straw and a small portion of soup ought to be allowed us.\r\n\r\n\"The terrible scenes and sufferings we had gone through had deprived\r\nmany of our number of their reason. Some of the madmen were dangerous,\r\nand made attempts to take the lives of their companions; others\r\ndid nothing but shout and scream day and night. The second night\r\nwe passed in the _orangerie_ the Englishman and I thought we had\r\nsecured a place where we might lie down and sleep in the side gallery;\r\nbut at midnight we were attacked by one of the most dangerous of\r\nthe madmen. It was useless to hope to find any other place to lie\r\ndown in, and we had no more rest that night, for several maniacs\r\npersisted in following us wherever we went, and would allow us\r\nno repose. I counted that night forty-four men bereft of reason\r\nwandering about and attacking others, as they had done ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"The next day we found ourselves at last in the ranks of those\r\nwho were to leave the _orangerie_. Our names were inscribed at\r\neleven o'clock, and we stood in rank till seven in the evening,\r\nafraid to lose our places if we stirred. What our destination might\r\nbe, was to us unknown; but there was not a man who was not glad\r\nto quit the place where we had suffered such misery.\"\r\n\r\nTheir destination proved to be Brest, which they reached at midnight\r\nof the next day, after travelling in cattle-cars for about thirty\r\nhours. They were transferred at once to a hulk lying in the harbor,\r\nclean shirts and water to wash with were given them, which seemed\r\npositive luxuries. Their treatment was not bad; they had hammocks\r\nto sleep in, and permission to smoke on deck every other day. But\r\nthe sufferings they had gone through, and the terribly foul air of\r\nthe _orangerie_, had so broken them down that most of them were\r\nstricken by a kind of jail-fever. Many, without warning, would\r\ndrop down as if in a fit, and be carried to a hospital ship moored\r\nnear them, to be seen no more.\r\n\r\nOur Englishman remained three weeks on board this hulk, and then\r\nescaped; but by what means he did not, in October, 1871, venture\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nHe concludes his narrative with these words:--\r\n\r\n\"When I think of those who were with me who still remain in the\r\nsame condition, and apparently with no chance of release, my heart\r\ngrows sick within me, and I can only be thankful to Almighty God\r\nfor my miraculous and providential escape. In conclusion let me say,\r\nas one who lived and suffered among them, that so far from speaking\r\nhardly of the miserable creatures who have been led astray, one ought\r\nrather to pity them. The greater part of those who served the Commune\r\n(for all in Paris, with but few exceptions, did serve) were 'pressed\r\nmen' like myself. But those who had wives and children to support\r\nand were without work--nay, even without means of obtaining a crust\r\nof bread (for the siege had exhausted all their little savings)--were\r\nforced by necessity to enroll themselves in the National Guard for\r\nthe sake of their daily pay.\r\n\r\n\"In the regular army of the Commune (if I may so style the National\r\nGuard) there were but few volunteers, and these were in general\r\norderly and respectable men; but the irregular regiments, such as\r\nthe _Enfants Perdus, Chasseurs Fédérés, Défenseurs de la Colonne de\r\nJuillet_, etc., were nothing but troops of blackguards and ruffians,\r\nwho made their uniforms an excuse for robbery and pillage. Such men\r\ndeserved the vengeance which overtook the majority of them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRESIDENT ADOLPH THIERS._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF THE THIRD REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Commune took place in the last week of May, 1871.\r\nWe must go back to the surrender of Paris, in the last week of\r\nJanuary of the same year, and take up the history of France from\r\nthe election of the National Assembly called together at Bordeaux\r\nto conclude terms of peace with the Prussians, to the election\r\nof the first president of the Third Republic, during which time\r\nFrance was under the dictatorship of M. Thiers.\r\n\r\nAdolphe Thiers was born in Marseilles, April 16, 1797. He was a\r\npoor little baby, whose father, an ex-Jacobin, had fled from France\r\nto escape the counter-revolution. The doctor who superintended his\r\nentrance into the world recorded that he was a healthy, active\r\nchild, with remarkably short legs. These legs remained short all\r\nhis life, but his body grew to be that of a tall, powerful man.\r\nHis appearance was by no means aristocratic or dignified if seen\r\nfrom a distance, but his defects of person were redeemed by the\r\nwondrous sparkle in his eyes. The family of his mother, on the\r\nmaternal side, was named Lhommaça, and was of Greek origin. It\r\ncame from the Levant, and its members spoke Greek among themselves.\r\nMadame Thiers' father was named Arnic, and his descent was also\r\nLevantine. Mademoiselle Arnic made a love-match in espousing Thiers,\r\na widower, who after the 9th Thermidor had taken refuge under her\r\nfather's roof. A writer who obtained materials for a sketch of\r\nThiers from the Thiers himself, says,--\r\n\r\n\"She pitied him, she was dazzled by his brilliant parts, charmed\r\nby his plausible manners, and regardless of his poverty and his\r\nincumbrance of many children, she insisted on marrying him. Her\r\nfamily was indignant, and cast her off; nor did she long find comfort\r\nin her husband. She was a Royalist, and remained so to the end\r\nof her days; he was a Jacobin. Moreover, she soon found that his\r\ntastes led him to drink and dissipation.\"\r\n\r\nThis man, the father of Thiers, was small of stature, mercurial\r\nin temperament, of universal aptitudes, much wit, and a perennial\r\nbuoyancy of disposition. His weakness, like his son's, was a passion\r\nfor omniscience. Some one said of him: \"He talks encyclopedia,\r\nand if anybody asked him, would be at no loss to tell you what\r\nwas passing in the moon.\" He had been educated for the Bar, and\r\nbelonged to a family of the _haute bourgeoisie_ of Provence; but\r\neverything was changed by the revolutionary see-saw, and shortly\r\nbefore his son was born, he had been a stevedore in the docks of\r\nMarseilles. His father (the statesman's grandfather) had been a cloth\r\nmerchant and a man of erudition. He wrote a History of Provence,\r\nand died at the age of ninety-five. The Thiers who preceded him\r\nlived to be ninety-seven, and was a noted gastronome, whose house\r\nat Marseilles in the early part of the eighteenth century was known\r\nfar and wide for hospitality and good cheer. He was ruined by\r\nspeculative ventures in the American colonies.\r\n\r\nThiers' grandfather, the cloth merchant, was a Royalist, who brought\r\ndown upon himself the wrath of the Jacobins by inciting the more\r\nmoderate party in Marseilles to seize the commissioners sent to\r\nthem by the Convention, and imprison them in the Château d'If. His\r\nson (Thiers' father), being himself a Jacobin, helped to release\r\nthe prisoners, and accepted an office under them in Marseilles. This\r\nwas the reason why he had to conceal himself during the reaction\r\nthat followed the fall of Robespierre. But all his life he bobbed\r\nlike a cork to the surface of events, or with equal facility sank\r\nbeneath them. He seems to have been \"everything by turns, and nothing\r\nlong.\" Among other employments he became an _impressario_, and\r\nwent with an opera _troupe_ to Italy. There for a time he kept a\r\ngaming table, and finally turned up at Joseph Bonaparte's court\r\nat Naples. He became popular with King Joseph, and followed him to\r\nMadrid. He was a French Micawber, without the domestic affections\r\nof his English counterpart, but with far more brilliant chances.\r\nHis wife was left to struggle at Marseilles with her own boy to\r\nsupport, and with a host of step-children. What she would have\r\ndone but for the kindness of her mother, Madame Arnic, it is hard\r\nto tell.\r\n\r\nMeantime Adolphe was adopted and educated by Madame Arnic. She\r\nhad provided him from his birth with influential patrons in the\r\npersons of two well-to-do godfathers. The boy was brought up in\r\none of those beautiful _bastides_, or sea-and-country villas, which\r\nadorn the shores of Provence. There he ran wild with the little\r\npeasant boys, and subsequently in Marseilles with the _gamins_\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nHis cousin, the poet André Chénier, got him an appointment to one\r\nof the _lycées_, or high-schools, established by Napoleon; but his\r\ngrandmother would not hear of his \"wearing Bonaparte's livery.\"\r\nThe two god-fathers had to threaten to apply to the absent Micawber\r\non the subject, if the boy's mother and grandmother stood in the way\r\nof his education. They yielded at last, and accepted the appointment\r\noffered them. Adolphe passed with high marks into the institution,\r\nand it cost him no trouble to keep always at the head of his classes.\r\nBut in play hours there was never a more troublesome boy. He so\r\nperplexed and annoyed his superiors that they were on the eve of\r\nexpelling him, when a new master came to the _lycée_ from Paris, and\r\nall was changed. This master had ruined his prospects by writing a\r\npamphlet against the Empire. A warm friendship sprang up between him\r\nand his brilliant pupil. The good man was an unbending republican.\r\nWhen Thiers became Prime Minister of France under Louis Philippe,\r\nhe wrote to his old master and offered him an important post in\r\nthe Bureau of Public Instruction; but the old man refused it. He\r\nwould not accept Louis Philippe as \"the best of republics,\" and\r\nended his letter by saying: \"The best thing I can wish you is that\r\nyou may soon retire from office, and that for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of this new teacher roused all Thiers' faculties\r\nand stimulated his industry. From that time forward he became the\r\nmost industrious man of his age. The bulletins and the victories\r\nof Napoleon excited his imagination. He would take a bulletin for\r\nhis theme, and write up an account of a battle, supplementing his\r\nfew facts by his own vivid imagination. His idea was that France\r\nmust be the strongest of European powers, or she would prove the\r\nweakest; she could not hold a middle place in the federation of\r\nEuropean nations.\r\n\r\nWhen Thiers had finished his school course his grandmother mortgaged\r\nher house to supply funds for his entrance into the college at\r\nAix. He could not enter the army on account of his size, and he\r\naspired to the Bar. His family was very poor at that period. Thiers\r\nlargely supported himself by painting miniatures, which it is said\r\nhe did remarkably well.\r\n\r\nAt Aix he found good literary society and congenial associations.\r\nHis friendship with his fellow-historian, Mignet, began in their\r\ncollege days. At Aix, too, where he was given full liberty to enjoy\r\nthe Marquis d'Alberta's gallery of art and wonderful collection\r\nof curiosities and bronzes, he acquired his life-long taste for\r\nsuch things. Aix was indeed a place full of collections,--of\r\nantiquities, of cameos, of marbles, etc.\r\n\r\nThiers' first literary success was the winning a prize at Nîmes for\r\na monograph on Vauvenargues, a moralist of the eighteenth century,\r\ncalled by Voltaire the master-mind of his period. He won this prize\r\nunder remarkable circumstances. The commission to award it was\r\ncomposed, largely of Royalists, who did not like to assign it to a\r\ncompetitor, who, if not a Republican, was at least a Bonapartist.\r\nThiers had read passages from his essay to friends, and the\r\ncommissioners were aware of its authorship. They therefore postponed\r\ntheir decision. Meantime Thiers wrote another essay on the same\r\nsubject. Mignet had it copied, and forwarded to Nîmes from Paris,\r\nwith a new motto. This essay won the first prize; and Thiers' other\r\nessay won the second prize, greatly to his amusement and delight,\r\nand to the annoyance and discomfiture of the Committee of Decision.\r\n\r\nWith six hundred francs in his pocket ($120), he went up to Paris,\r\nmaking the journey on foot. Having arrived there, he made his way\r\nto his friend Mignet's garret, weary and footsore, carrying his\r\nbundle in his hand. Mignet was not at home; but in the opposite\r\nchamber, which Thiers entered to make inquiries for his friend, was\r\na gay circle of Bohemians, who were enjoying a revel. The traveller\r\nwho broke in upon their mirth is thus described:--\r\n\r\n\"He wore a coat that had been green, and was faded to yellow, tight\r\nbuff trousers too short to cover his ankles, and dusty, and glossy\r\nfrom long use, a pair of clumsy blucher boots, and a hat worthy\r\nof a place in the cabinet of an antiquary. His face was tanned\r\na deep brown, and a pair of brass-rimmed spectacles covered half\r\nhis face.\"\r\n\r\nThat was about 1821. Thiers was then not a profound politician, nor\r\nwas he very clear as to theories about republicanism; but he was\r\nan enthusiast for Napoleon, an enthusiast for France. He employed\r\nhis leisure in making notes in the public libraries on the events\r\nbetween 1788 and 1799,--the year of the 18th Brumaire. His future\r\nHistory of the Revolution, Consulate, and Empire began, unconsciously\r\nto himself, to grow under his hand. He had hoped to be called to the\r\nBar in Paris; but as his want of height had prevented his entering\r\nthe army, so his want of money prevented his entrance to the ranks\r\nof the lawyers of the capital. The council which recommends such\r\nadmissions required at that period that the person seeking admittance\r\nshould show himself possessed of a well-furnished domicile and a\r\nsufficient income. Thiers' resources fell far short of this. For\r\na while he supported himself in Paris as best he could, partly by\r\npainting fans; he then returned to Aix, where he was admitted to\r\nthe Bar. But he could not stay long away from Paris. He returned,\r\nand again struggled with poverty, painting and making applications\r\nfor literary and newspaper work in all directions. At last, about\r\nthe time of Louis XVIII.'s death, Manuel, the semi-republican deputy\r\nfrom Marseilles, took him up. He was then engaged upon his History,\r\nand was private secretary to the Duc de Liancourt, to whose notice\r\nhe had been brought by Talleyrand in a letter which said: \"Two\r\nyoung men have lately brought me strong recommendations. One is\r\ngentlemanly and appears to have the qualifications you desire in\r\na secretary; the other is uncouth to a degree, but I think I can\r\ndiscern in him sparks of the fire of genius.\" The duke's reply\r\nwas brief: \"Send me the second one.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Thiers began to attract public notice as a clever and somewhat\r\nturbulent opponent of the priest party under Charles X. He got his\r\nfirst journalistic employment from the editor of a leading paper\r\nin Paris, the \"Constitutionnel.\" He had a letter of introduction to\r\nthe editor, who, nowise impressed by his appearance, and wishing\r\nto get rid of him, politely said he had no work vacant on the paper\r\nexcept that of criticising the pictures in the Salon, which he\r\npresumed M. Thiers' could not undertake. On the contrary, Thiers\r\nfelt sure he could do the work, which the editor, confident of his\r\nfailure, allowed him to try. The result was a review that startled\r\nall Paris, and Thiers was at once engaged on the \"Constitutionnel\" as\r\nliterary, dramatic, and artistic critic. He proved to have a perfect\r\ngenius for journalism, and all his life he considered newspaper\r\nwork his profession. Before long he aspired to take part in the\r\nmanagement of his paper, and to that end saved and scraped together\r\nevery cent in his power, assisted by a German bookseller named\r\nSchubert, the original of Schmuke, in Balzac's \"Cousin Pons.\" The\r\n\"Constitutionnel\" grew more and more popular and more and more\r\npowerful; but still Thiers' means were very small, and he was bent\r\non saving all he could to establish a new newspaper, the \"National.\"\r\nHe was engaged to be married to a young lady at Aix, whose father\r\nthought he was neglecting her, and came up to Paris to see about\r\nit. Thiers pleaded for delay. He had not money enough, he said,\r\nto set up housekeeping. A second time the impatient father came\r\nto Paris on the same errand, and on receiving the same answer,\r\nassaulted Thiers publicly and challenged him. The duel took place.\r\nThiers fired in the air, and his adversary's ball passed between\r\nhis little legs. Nobody was hurt, but the match was broken off,\r\nand the young lady died of the disappointment. Thiers kept every\r\nmemorial he had of her sacredly to the day of his death, and in\r\nthe time of his power sought out and provided for the members of\r\nher family.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about M. Thiers was the unusual\r\ncare he took to prepare himself fully before writing or speaking.\r\nHe had every subject clearly and fully in his own mind before he put\r\npen to paper, and when he began to write, he did so with extraordinary\r\nrapidity; nor would he write any account of anything, either in\r\na newspaper or in his history, till he had visited localities,\r\nconversed with eye-witnesses, and picked up floating legends.\r\n\r\nBy an accident he became acquainted before other Parisian journalists\r\nwith the signing of the Ordinances by Charles X., July 26, 1830.\r\nHe had also good reason to think that Louis Philippe, if offered\r\nthe crown of France or the lieutenant-generalship of the kingdom,\r\nwould accept it. While fighting was going on in Paris, he and Ary\r\nScheffer, the artist, were the two persons deputed to go to Neuilly\r\nand sound the Duke of Orleans. As we have seen, Marie Amélie, the\r\nduke's wife, indignantly refused their overtures in the absence of\r\nher husband, while Madame Adélaïde, his sister, encouraged them.\r\n\r\nThiers, Laffitte, and Lafayette became the foremost men in Paris\r\nat this crisis, and at the end of some days Louis Philippe became\r\nking of the French. He wanted to make Thiers one of his ministers,\r\nbut Thiers characteristically declined so high an office until\r\nhe should have served an apprenticeship to ministerial work in\r\nan under secretary-ship, and knew the machinery and the working\r\nof all departments of government.\r\n\r\nThus far I have not spoken of Thiers' \"History of the Revolution.\"\r\nIt appeared first in monthly parts. Up to the publication of the\r\nfirst number, in 1823, no writer in France had dared to speak well\r\nof any actor in the Revolution. Thiers' History, as it became known,\r\ncreated a great sensation. Thiers himself was supposed by the general\r\npublic (both of his own country and of foreign nations) to be a\r\nwild revolutionist. At first the critics knew not how to speak of a\r\nbook that admired the States-General and defended the Constitutional\r\nConvention; but by the time the third volume was completed, in 1827,\r\nit was bought up eagerly. The work was published afterwards in\r\nten volumes, and the \"History of the Consulate and Empire,\" which\r\nappeared between 1845 and 1861, is in twenty volumes; but it is\r\nonly fair to say that the print is very large and the illustrations\r\nare very numerous, and that the portraits especially are beyond\r\nall praise.\r\n\r\nFrom 1831 to 1836, Thiers was one of Louis Philippe's ministers,\r\nand from 1836 to 1840 he was Prime Minister, or President of the\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Thiers rose to power his mercurial father made his appearance\r\nin Paris. Thiers was disposed to receive him very coldly. \"What have\r\nyou ever done for me that you have any claim on me?\" he asked. \"My\r\nson,\" replied the prodigal parent, \"if I had been an ordinary father\r\nand had stayed by my family and brought up a houseful of children in\r\nobscurity, do you suppose you would have been where you are now?\"\r\nAt this Thiers laughed, and gave his father a post-mastership in\r\na small town in the South of France called Carpentras. There the\r\nold gentleman lived, disreputable and extravagant to the last,\r\nsurrounded by a large family of dogs.\r\n\r\nThiers provided at the earliest possible moment for his mother\r\nand grandmother, buying for the latter a pretty little property\r\nwhich she had always coveted, near Aix, and taking his mother to\r\npreside over his own home. But Madame Thiers felt out of place in\r\nher son's life, and preferred to return to the property given to\r\nMadame Arnic, where she spent the rest of her days with the old\r\nlady. Lamartine tells a pretty anecdote of Thiers' relations with\r\nhis mother. The poet and the statesman had been dining together at a\r\nfriend's house, in 1830, when Thiers was already a cabinet officer.\r\nOn leaving together after dinner, they found in the ante-room an\r\nelderly woman plainly and roughly dressed. She was asking for M.\r\nThiers, who, as soon as he saw her, ran to her, clasped her in\r\nhis arms, kissed her, and then, leading her by both hands up to\r\nthe poet, cried joyously: \"Lamartine, this is my mother!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1834 Thiers married a beautiful young girl fresh from her _pension_,\r\nMademoiselle Dosne, who was co-heiress with her mother and her\r\nfather to a great fortune. Unhappily Thiers had fallen first in\r\nlove with the mother; but he accepted the daughter instead. The\r\nearly married life of Madame Thiers was saddened by her knowledge\r\nof this state of things. She was devoted to the interests of her\r\nhusband, and watched over him as a mother might have watched over a\r\nchild. She was an accomplished woman and most careful housekeeper,\r\nand had received an excellent education. She knew many languages,\r\nand turned all English or German documents required by her husband\r\ninto French. She was also a charming hostess, but she lived under\r\nthe shadow of a great sorrow.\r\n\r\nWhen Thiers was to be married, he paid his father twelve thousand\r\nfrancs (about $2,500) for the legal parental consent which is necessary\r\nin a French marriage; but he was by no means anxious to have his\r\nirrepressible parent at his wedding. For three weeks before the\r\nevent he hired all the places in all the stage-coaches running\r\nthrough Carpentras to Lyons.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 M. Thiers went out of office, in consequence of a dispute\r\nwith England about the Eastern Question. The only charge that his\r\nenemies ever brought against him affecting his honor as a politician\r\nwas that of employing the Jew Deutz to act the part of Judas towards\r\nthe Duchesse de Berri; but for that he could plead that it solved\r\na difficulty, and probably saved many lives.\r\n\r\nDuring the Second Empire he kept much in retirement. At first he\r\nhad thought that Prince Louis Napoleon, seeing in him the historian\r\nand panegyrist of the Great Emperor, would call him to his councils.\r\nBut he was quite mistaken. He could not--nor _would_ he--have served\r\nLouis Napoleon's turn as did such men as Persigny, Saint-Arnaud,\r\nDe Maupas, and De Morny. When the _coup d'état_ came, Thiers was\r\nimprisoned with the other deputies, the only favor allowed him\r\nbeing a bed, while the other deputies had no couch but the floor.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 there was a general election in France, which was carefully\r\nmanipulated by the Government, in order that, if possible, no deputy\r\nmight be sent to the Chamber who would provoke discussion on the\r\nchanges in the Constitution submitted by the emperor. Thiers thought\r\nit time for him to re-enter public life and to speak out to his\r\ncountrymen. At this time one of the gentlemen attached to the English\r\nembassy in Paris had a conversation with him. \"For a man,\" he says,\r\n\"of talents, learning, and experience, I never met one who impressed\r\nme as having so great an idea of his own self-importance;\" but\r\nthe visitor was at the same time impressed by his frankness and\r\nsincerity. Speaking of the Emperor Napoleon III., and foreseeing\r\nhis downfall, he said: \"What will succeed him, I know not. God\r\ngrant it may not be the ruin of France!... For a long time I kept\r\nquiet. It was no use breaking one's head against the wall; but\r\nnow we have revolution staring us in the face as an alternative\r\nwith the Empire; and do you think I should be doing well or rightly\r\nby my fellow-citizens, were I to keep in the background? If I am\r\nwanted, I shall not fail.\" As he spoke, the fire in his eyes sparkled\r\nright through the glass of his spectacles, and all the time he\r\ntalked, he was walking rapidly up and down. When greatly animated,\r\nhe seemed even to grow taller and taller, so that on some great\r\noccasion a lady said of him to Charles Greville: \"Did you know,\r\nThiers is handsome! and is six feet high!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the fall of the Empire occurred, in September, 1870, M. Thiers\r\nwas in Paris; but when the Committee of Defence was formed, he\r\nquitted the capital, before the arrival of the Prussians, to go\r\nfrom court to court,--to London, St. Petersburg, Vienna,--to implore\r\nthe intervention of diplomacy, and to prove how essential to the\r\nbalance of power in Europe was the preservation of France. His\r\nfeeling was that France ought promptly to have made peace after\r\nSedan, that her cause then was hopeless for the moment, and that by\r\nmaking the best terms she could, and by husbanding her resources,\r\nshe might rise in her might at a future day. These views were not\r\nin the least shared by Gambetta, who believed--as, indeed, most\r\nFrenchmen and most foreigners believed in 1870--that a general\r\nuprising in France would be sufficient to crush the Prussians.\r\nThiers knew better; his policy was to save France for herself and\r\nfrom herself at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _LÉON GAMBETTA._]\r\n\r\nWe already know the story. Gambetta escaped from Paris in a balloon,\r\nand joined Crémieux and Garnier-Pagès, the other two members of\r\nthe Committee of Defence who were outside of Paris. At Tours they\r\nhad set up a sort of government, and there, in virtue of being\r\nthe War Minister of the Committee of Defence, Gambetta proceeded\r\nto take all power into his own hands, and to become dictator of\r\nmasterless France. It was like a shipwreck in which, captain and\r\nofficers being disabled, the command falls to the most able seaman.\r\nGambetta had no legal right to govern France, but he governed it\r\nby right divine, as the only man who could govern it.\r\n\r\nThis is how a newspaper writer speaks--and justly--of Gambetta's\r\ngovernment:--\r\n\r\n\"From the moment when he dropped, tired out with his journey by\r\nballoon, into his chair in the archiepiscopal palace at Tours,\r\nand announced that he was invested with full powers to defend the\r\ncountry, no one throughout France seriously disputed his authority.\r\nHis colleagues became his clerks. The treasury was empty, but he\r\nre-filled it. The arsenal was half empty, but in six weeks one\r\ngreat army, and almost two, were supplied with artillery, horses,\r\ngunners, and breech-loaders. The Lyons Reds had been told that\r\nthey were wicked fools, and Communists and Anarchists ripe for\r\nrevolt in Toulouse, Lyons, and Marseilles had been put down. The\r\nrespectables everywhere rose at his summons, anarchy and military\r\ndisobedience quailed.\"\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of war forced Gambetta and his Government from the\r\nbanks of the Loire to Bordeaux. There, at the close of January,\r\n1871, Jules Favre arrived from the Central Committee in Paris to\r\nannounce, with shame and grief, that resistance was over: Paris\r\nhad capitulated to the Prussians; and it only remained to elect a\r\nGeneral Assembly which should create a regular government empowered\r\nto make peace with the enemy.\r\n\r\nFor a few hours that night the fate of France hung trembling in\r\nthe scales. Thiers was in Bordeaux. He was known to think that\r\nFrance could only save what was left by accepting the armistice.\r\nGambetta was known to be for _No Surrender!_ Which should prevail?\r\nWould the dictator lay aside his power without a struggle?\r\n\r\nGambetta rose to the occasion during the night; but here the histories\r\nof Thiers and Gambetta run together; therefore, before I tell of what\r\nhappened the next day, let me say a few words about the personal\r\nhistory of Léon Gambetta. He was only thirty-three years old at\r\nthis time, having been born in 1838, when Thiers was forty-one\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nGambetta's birthplace was Cahors, that city in the South of France\r\nstigmatized by Dante as the abode of usurers and scoundrels. His\r\nfamily was Italian and came from Genoa, but he was born a Frenchman,\r\nthough his Italian origin, temperament, and complexion were constantly\r\ncast up against him. In his infancy he had been intended for the\r\npriesthood, and was sent, when seven years old, to some place where\r\nhe was to be educated and trained for it. He soon wrote to his\r\nfather that he was so miserable that if he were not taken away\r\nhe would put out one of his eyes, which would disqualify him for\r\nthe priestly calling. His father took no notice of the childish\r\nthreat, and Gambetta actually plucked out one of his own eyes.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 he was a young lawyer in Paris; but his eloquence and ability\r\nwere known only at the Café Procope to a circle of admiring\r\nfellow-Bohemians. On All Saints Day, 1868, the Press, presuming\r\non the recent relaxation of personal government by the emperor,\r\napplauded the crowds who went to cover with funeral wreaths the grave\r\nof Baudin at Père la Chaise. Baudin had been the first man killed on\r\nDec. 2, 1851, when offering resistance to the _coup d'état._ The\r\nPress was prosecuted for its utterances on this occasion. Gambetta\r\ndefended one of the journals. Being an advocate, he could say what\r\nhe pleased without danger of prosecution, and all Paris rang with\r\nthe bitterness of his attack upon the Empire. From that moment he\r\nwas a power in France. In person he was dark, short, stout, and\r\nsomewhat vulgar, nor was there any social polish in his manners.\r\n\r\nNot long after his great speech in defence of the Press, in the matter\r\nof Baudin, Gambetta was elected to the Chamber by the working-men\r\nof Belleville, and at the same time by Marseilles. He entered the\r\nChamber as one wholly irreconcilable with the Empire or the emperor.\r\nHis eloquence was heart-stirring, and commanded attention even\r\nfrom his adversaries.\r\n\r\nWhen, on Sept. 4, 1870, the downfall of the Empire was proclaimed,\r\nGambetta was made a member of the Council of Defence, and became\r\nMinister of the Interior. He remained in Paris until after the\r\nsiege had begun; but he burned to be where he could _act_, and\r\nobtained the consent of his colleagues to go forth by balloon and\r\ntry to stir up a warlike spirit in the Provinces. He was made Minister\r\nof War in addition to being Minister of the Interior. From Nov.\r\n1, 1870, to Jan. 30, 1871, his efforts were almost superhuman;\r\nand but for Bazaine's surrender at Metz, they might have been\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nGambetta raised two armies,--one under General Aurelles des Paladines\r\nand General Chanzy; the other under Bourbaki and Garibaldi. The\r\nfirst was the Army of the Loire, the second of the Jura.\r\n\r\nWhen the plan of co-operation with Bazaine's one hundred and\r\nseventy-five thousand well-trained troops had failed, and the Army of\r\nthe Loire had been repulsed at Orleans, Gambetta with his Provisional\r\nGovernment moved to Bordeaux. Thither came Thiers, returned from\r\nhis roving embassy,--a mission of peace whose purpose had been\r\ndefeated by the warlike movements of Gambetta's armies.\r\n\r\nGambetta in the early days of his dictatorship wrote to Jules Favre:\r\n\"France must not entertain one thought of peace.\" He sincerely believed\r\nany effort at negotiation with the Prussians an acknowledgment of\r\nweakness, and he fondly fancied that a little more time and experience\r\nwould turn his raw recruits into armies capable of driving back the\r\nPrussians, when the experienced generals and soldiers of France\r\nhad failed.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have reached that terrible hour when news was received\r\nat Bordeaux that all Gambetta's efforts had been useless; that\r\nParis had consented to an armistice; that an Assembly was to be\r\nelected, a National Government to be formed; and that to resist\r\nthese things or to persist longer in fighting the Prussians would\r\nbe to provoke civil war.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Gambetta and Thiers, both devoted Frenchmen, both\r\nleaders of parties with opposing views,--the one resolved on No\r\nsurrender, the other urging Peace on the best terms now\r\nprocurable,--passed a terrible night after Jules Favre's arrival\r\nat Bordeaux, Gambetta debating what was his duty as the idol of\r\nhis followers and as provisional dictator, Thiers dreading lest\r\ncivil war might be kindled by the decision of his rival.\r\n\r\nHardly less anxious were the days while a general election was\r\ngoing on. Bordeaux remained feverish and excited till February\r\n13, when deputies from all parts of France met to decide their\r\ncountry's fate in the Bordeaux theatre. Notabilities from foreign\r\ncountries were also there, to see what would be done at that supreme\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nSeven hundred and fifty deputies had been sent to the Assembly, and\r\nit was clear from the beginning that that body was not Republican. But\r\nthe Anti-Republicans were divided into three parties,--Imperialists,\r\nLegitimists, and Orleanists, each of which preferred an orderly and\r\nmoderate republic to the triumph of either of the other two. Moreover,\r\nthat was not the time for deliberations concerning a permanent\r\nform of government. The deputies were met to make a temporary or\r\nprovisional government, qualified to accept or to refuse the hard\r\nterms of peace offered by the Prussians. The two leaders of the\r\nAssembly were Thiers and Gambetta,--the one in favor of peace,\r\nthe other of prolonging the war. We can see now how much wiser\r\nwere the views of the elder statesman than those of the younger;\r\nbut we see also what a bitter pang Gambetta's patriotic spirit\r\nmust have suffered by the downfall of his dictatorship.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly had been three days in session, clamorous, riotous,\r\nand full of words, when in the middle of the afternoon of Feb. 16,\r\n1871, two delegates from Alsace and Lorraine appeared, supported by\r\nGambetta. The Speaker--that is, the president of the Assembly--was\r\nM. Jules Grévy, who had held the same office in 1848; he found it\r\nhard to restrain the excitement of the deputies. The delegates\r\ncame to implore France not to deliver them over to the Germans;\r\nto remember that of all Frenchmen the Alsatians had been the most\r\nFrench in the days of the Revolution, and that in all the wars\r\nof France for more than a century they had suffered most of all\r\nher children. No wonder the hearts of all in the Assembly were\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\n\"At this moment there appeared in the midde aisle of the theatre\r\na small man, with wrinkled face and stubbly white hair. He seemed\r\nto have got there by magic, for no one had seen him spring into\r\nthat place. He looked around him for an instant, much as a sailor\r\nglances over the sky in a storm, then, stretching out his short\r\nright arm, he made a curious downstroke which conveyed an impression\r\nof intense vitality and will. Profound silence was established\r\nin a moment. The elderly man then made another gesture, throwing\r\nhis arm up, as if to say: 'Good! Now you will listen.' He then,\r\nin a thin, piping, but distinctly audible voice, began a sharp\r\npractical address. Everyone listened with the utmost attention;\r\nnone dared to interrupt him. He spoke for five minutes, nervously\r\npounding the air from time to time, and sometimes howling his words\r\nat the listeners in a manner that made them cringe. He counselled\r\nmoderation, accord, decency, but above all, instant action. 'The\r\nsettlement of the Alsace-Lorraine question,' said he, 'will virtually\r\ndecide whether we have peace or continued war with Prussia.' Then,\r\nwith an imperious gesture of command, he turned away. 'Come,' he\r\nsaid, 'let us to our committee-rooms, and let us say what we think.'\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, the committee appointed to recommend a chief of\r\nthe executive power announced that its choice had fallen on this\r\norator, M. Thiers. At once he was proclaimed head of the French\r\nRepublic, but not before he had hurried out of the theatre. Then\r\nthe session closed, and a quarter of an hour after, Lord Lyons,\r\nthe English ambassador, had waited on M. Thiers to inform him that\r\nHer Majesty's Government recognized the French Republic.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, for more than two years, M. Thiers was the supreme\r\nruler of France. His work was visible in every department of\r\nadministration. Ministers, while his power lasted, simply obeyed\r\nhis commands.\r\n\r\nThere were some amusing, gossipy stories told in Bordeaux of Thiers'\r\nentrance into possession of Gambetta's bachelor quarters at the\r\nPrefecture. \"Pah! what a smell of tobacco!\" he is said to have\r\ncried, as he strutted into his deposed rival's study. All his family\r\njoined him in bewailing the condition of the house; and until it\r\ncould be cleansed and purified they were glad to accept an invitation\r\nto take refuge in the archbishop's palace. In a few days all was\r\nput to rights, and a guard of honor was set to keep off intruders\r\non the chief's privacy. On the first day of this arrangement, M.\r\nThiers addressed some question to the sentinel. The man was for a\r\nmoment embarrassed how to answer him. M. Thiers was for the time\r\nthe chief executive officer of the Republic, but he was not formally\r\nits president. The soldier's answer, \"Oui, mon Exécutif,\" caused\r\nmuch amusement.\r\n\r\nAt this time there was no suspicion in men's minds that it was the\r\nintention of M. Thiers to form a permanent republic. The feeling of\r\nthe country was Royalist. The difficulty was what royalty? It seemed\r\nto all men, and very probably to Thiers himself, that that question\r\nwould be answered in favor of Henri V., the Comte de Chambord.\r\n\r\nGambetta, resigning his power without a word, retired to San Sebastian,\r\njust over the Spanish frontier. There he lived in two small rooms\r\nover a crockery-shop. \"He is jaded for want of sleep,\" writes a\r\nfriend, \"and distressed by money matters.\" Much of his time he\r\nspent in fishing, no doubt meditating deeply on things present,\r\npast, and future.\r\n\r\nNo pains were spared to induce him to give in his adhesion to one\r\nof the candidates for royalty. His best friend wrote thus to him:--\r\n\r\n\"Those wretches the Communists have destroyed all my illusions,\r\nbut perhaps I could have forgiven them but for their ingratitude\r\nto you. See how their newspapers have reviled you! A time may come\r\nwhen a republic may be possible in France; but that day is not\r\nwith us yet. Let us acknowledge that we have both made a mistake.\r\nAs for you, with your unrivalled genius you have now a patriotic\r\ncareer open before you, if you will cast in your lot with the men\r\nwho are now going to try and quell anarchy.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Clément Laurier, Cornhill Magazine, 1883.]\r\n\r\nBesides this, offers were made him of the prime minister-ship, a\r\ndukedom, a Grand Cordon, and other preferment; but Gambetta only\r\nlaughed at these proposals. He was a man who had many faults, but\r\nhe was always honest and true. Both he and M. Thiers were devoted\r\nFrenchmen, patriots in the truest sense of the word, and each took\r\nopposite views. That Thiers was right has been proved by time.\r\n\r\nOn March 16 the Government of the Provisional Republic removed from\r\nBordeaux to Versailles. Nobody dreamed of the pending outbreak of\r\nthe Commune; all the talk was of fusion between the elder Bourbon\r\nbranch and the House of Orleans.\r\n\r\nThiers was decidedly opposed to taking the seat of government to\r\nParis, nor did he wish a new election for an Assembly; he preferred\r\nFontainebleau for the seat of government, but fortunately (looking\r\nat the matter in the light of events) Versailles was chosen.\r\n\r\nThen, to the great indignation of Madame Thiers, the Royalists at\r\nonce took measures to prevent M. Thiers from installing himself\r\nin Louis XIV.'s great bedchamber. \"The Château,\" they said, \"was\r\nto become the abode of the National Legislature, the state rooms\r\nmust be devoted to the use of members, and the private apartments\r\nshould be occupied by M. Grévy, the president of the Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\"M. Thiers would no doubt have liked very much to sleep in Louis\r\nXIV's bed, and to have for his study that fine room with the balcony\r\nfrom which the heralds used to announce in the same breath the death\r\nof one king and the accession of another. His secretary could not\r\nhelp saying that it seemed fit that the greatest of French national\r\nhistorians should be lodged in the apartments of the greatest of\r\nFrench kings; but as this idea did not make its way, M. and Madame\r\nThiers yielded the point, saying that the chimneys smoked, and\r\nthat the rooms were too large to be comfortable.\"\r\n\r\nOn seeing a caricature in which some artist had represented him\r\nas a ridiculous pigmy crowned with a cotton night-cap and lying\r\nin an enormous bed, surrounded by the majestic ghosts of kings,\r\nThiers was at first half angry; then he said: \"Louis XIV. was not\r\ntaller than I, and as to his other greatness, I doubt whether he ever\r\nwould have had a chance of sleeping in the best bed of Versailles\r\nif he had begun life as I did.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Temple Bar.]\r\n\r\nSo M. Thiers went to reside where the Emperor William had had his\r\nquarters, at the Prefecture of Versailles, and soon the palace\r\nwas filled with refugees from Paris. Many of the state apartments\r\nwere turned into hospital wards. Louis XIV.'s bedchamber was given\r\nup to the finance committee.\r\n\r\nThe thing to be done, with speed and energy, as all men felt, was\r\nto re-besiege Paris and put down the Commune. All parties united\r\nin this work; but the conservatives confidently believed that when\r\nthis was done, Thiers and the moderate Republicans would join them\r\nin giving France a stable government under the Comte de Chambord.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 19, 1821, when that young prince was a year old, a public\r\nsubscription throughout France had presented him with the beautiful\r\nold Château de Chambord, built on the Loire by Francis I., and\r\nfrom which he adopted his title when in exile.\r\n\r\nAfter the young prince had been removed from his mother's influence,\r\nhe was carefully brought up in the most Bourbon of Bourbon traditions.\r\nWhen he became a man he travelled extensively in Europe. In 1841\r\nhe broke his leg by falling from his horse, and was slightly lame\r\nfor the rest of his life. In 1846 he married Marie Thérèse Beatrix\r\nof Modena, who was even more strictly Bourbon than himself. He and\r\nhis wife retired to Fröhsdorf, a beautiful country seat not very\r\nfar from Vienna. There they were constantly visited by travelling\r\nFrenchmen of all parties, and on no one did the prince fail to\r\nmake a favorable impression. He was good, upright, cultivated,\r\nkindly, but inflexibly wedded to the traditions of his family. He\r\nloved France with his whole soul, and was glad of anything that\r\nbrought her good and glory. But France was _his_,--his by divine\r\nright; and this right France must acknowledge. After that, there\r\nwas not anything he would not do for her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _COMPTE DE CHAMBORD._]\r\n\r\nBut France was not willing to efface all her history from 1792 to\r\n1871, with the exception of the episode of the Restoration, when\r\nschool histories were circulated mentioning Marengo, Austerlitz,\r\netc., as victories gained under the king's lieutenant-general, M.\r\nde Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nDuring the Empire, under Napoleon III., the Comte de Chambord had\r\nremained nearly passive at Fröhsdorf. His life was passed in meditation,\r\ndevotion, the cultivation of literary tastes, and a keen interest in\r\nall the events that were passing in his native country. During the\r\nFranco-Prussian war he sent words of encouragement to his suffering\r\ncountrymen, and nobly refrained from embarrassing the affairs of\r\nFrance by any personal intrigues; but when the war and the Commune\r\nwere over, and his chances of the throne grew bright, he issued a\r\nproclamation which has been called \"an act of political suicide.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 8, three weeks before the downfall of the Commune, he put\r\nforth his first manifesto. Here is what an English paper said of it\r\na few days before his next--the suicidal--proclamation appeared:--\r\n\r\n\"The Comte de Chambord does not, of course, surrender his own theory\r\nof his own place on earth, but he does offer some grave pledges\r\nintended to diminish suspicion as to the deduction he draws from\r\nhis claim to be king by right divine. He renounces formally and\r\ndistinctly any intention of exercising absolute power, and pledges\r\nhimself, as he says, 'to submit all acts of his government to the\r\ncareful control of representatives freely elected.' He declares\r\nthat if restored he will not interfere with equality, or attempt to\r\nestablish privileges. He promises complete amnesty, and employment\r\nunder his government to men of all parties; and finally he pledges\r\nhimself to secure effectual guarantees for the Pope [then trembling\r\non his temporal throne in Italy].\"\r\n\r\nThe English journalist continues,--\r\n\r\n\"The tone of this whole paper is that of a man who believes that\r\na movement will be made in his favor which may succeed, if only\r\nthe factions most likely to resist can be temporarily conciliated.\r\nThere is no especial reason that we can see that he should not be\r\nchosen. He has neither sympathized with the Germans, nor received\r\nsupport from them. He has not bombarded Paris. He is not more hated\r\nthan any other king would be,--perhaps less; for Paris has no gossip\r\nto tell of his career. Indeed, there are powerful reasons in favor\r\nof the choice. His restoration, since the Comte de Paris is his\r\nheir, would eliminate two of the dynastic parties which distract\r\nFrance, and would relink the broken chain of history. And to a\r\npeople so weary, so dispirited, so thirsty for repose, that of itself\r\nmust have a certain charm.\"\r\n\r\nBut all these advantages he destroyed for himself by a new proclamation\r\nissued five weeks later. In it he said,--\r\n\r\n\"I can neither forget that the monarchical right is the patrimony\r\nof the nation, nor decline the duties which it imposes on me. I\r\nwill fulfil these duties, believe me, on my word as an honest man\r\nand as a king.\"\r\n\r\nSo far was good; but proceeding to announce that thenceforward\r\nhe assumed the title of Henri V., he goes on to apostrophize the\r\n\"White Flag\" of the Bourbons. He says,--\r\n\r\n\"I received it as a sacred trust from the old king my grandfather\r\nwhen he was dying in exile. It has always been for me inseparable\r\nfrom the remembrance of my absent country. It waved above my cradle,\r\nand I wish to have it shade my tomb. Henri V. cannot abandon the\r\n'White Flag' of Henri IV.\"\r\n\r\nThis manifesto, written without consulting those who were working\r\nfor his cause in France, settled the question of his eligibility.\r\nFrance was not willing, for the sake of Henri V., to give up her\r\ntricolor,--the flag of so many memories. Its loss had been the\r\nbitterest humiliation that the nation had had to suffer at the\r\nRestoration.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Chambord's own friends were cruelly disappointed;\r\nthe moderate Republicans, who had been ready to accept him as a\r\nconstitutional monarch, said at once that he was far too Bourbon.\r\nThere was no longer any hope, unless he could be persuaded, on\r\nsome other convenient occasion, to renounce the \"White Flag.\"\r\n\r\nThis matter being settled by the Comte de Chambord himself, all\r\nM. Thiers' attention was turned to two things,--the disposal of\r\nthe Communist prisoners, and the payment of the indemnity demanded\r\nby the Germans, the five milliards.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to know that Thiers disapproved of the revengeful feeling\r\nthat pervaded politicians and society, regarding the Communist\r\nprisoners. He tried to save General Rossel, and failed. Rochefort\r\nand others he protected. He wished for a general amnesty, excluding\r\nonly the murderers of Thomas, Lecomte, and the hostages. He said, when\r\nsome one was speaking to him of the sufferings of those Communists\r\n(or supposed Communists) who were confined at Satory and in the\r\nOrangerie at Versailles: \"It was dreadful, but it could not be\r\navoided. We had twenty thousand prisoners, and not more than four\r\nhundred police to keep guard over them. We had to depend on the\r\nrough methods of an exasperated soldiery.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the indemnity, the promptness with which it was paid was\r\nmarvellous. The great bankers all over Europe, especially those of\r\nJewish connection, came forward and advanced the money. In eighteen\r\nmonths the five milliards of francs were in the coffers of the\r\nEmperor William, and the last Prussian soldier had quitted the\r\nsoil of France. The loan raised by the Government for the repayment\r\nof the sums advanced for the indemnity was taken up with enthusiasm\r\nby all classes of the French people.\r\n\r\nThe horrible year of 1871 was followed by one of perfect peace and\r\ngreat prosperity. The title of President of the French Republic\r\nwas conferred on M. Thiers for seven years. \"The nation seemed\r\nre-flowering, like a large plantation in a spring which follows\r\na hard winter.\" Trade revived. The traces of war and civil strife\r\nwere effaced with amazing promptness from the streets of Paris. The\r\narmy and all public services were reorganized, and to crown these\r\nblessings, the land yielded such a harvest as had not been seen\r\nfor half a century. M. Thiers was never much addicted to religious\r\nemotion; but when, on a Sunday in July, 1872, the news came to him\r\nby telegram of the glorious ingathering of the harvest in the South\r\nof France, he was quite overcome. \"Let us thank God,\" he cried,\r\nclasping his hands. \"He has heard us; our mourning is ended!\"\r\n\r\nM. Thiers was by that time living in Paris in the Élysée. He had\r\ncontinued to reside at the Prefecture of Versailles while the Assembly\r\nwas in session, but he came to the Élysée during its recess, and\r\nkept a certain state there. Yet he never would submit himself to\r\nthe restraints of etiquette. One who knew him well says:--\r\n\r\n\"He was _bourgeois_ to the finger-tips. His character was a curious\r\neffervescing mixture of talent, learning, vanity, childish petulance,\r\ninquisitiveness, sagacity, ecstatic patriotism, and ambition. He\r\nwas a splendid orator, with the voice of an old coster-woman; a\r\n_savant_ with the presumption of a school-boy; a kind-hearted man,\r\nwith the irritability of a monkey; a masterly administrator, with\r\nthat irresistible tendency to intermeddle with everything which\r\nis intolerable to subordinates. He had a sincere love of liberty,\r\nwith the instincts of a despot.\"\r\n\r\nM. Thiers had during his long life been a collector of pictures,\r\nbronzes, books, manuscripts, and curious relics. His house in the\r\nPlace Saint-Georges was a museum of these treasures, but a museum\r\nso arranged that it contributed to sociability and the enjoyment\r\nof his visitors. He had acquired this taste for collecting in his\r\nearly days at Aix. During the Commune his house was razed to the\r\nground, not one stone being left upon another.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commune put forth its decree for this act of vandalism,\r\nThiers' consternation was pathetic. The ladies of his family did\r\neverything that feminine energy and ingenuity could suggest to\r\navert the calamity. But when the destruction had taken place, Thiers\r\nbore his loss with dignity. His collections were very fine, but he\r\nhad always been afraid of their being damaged, and did not show\r\nthem to strangers. When the Commune sent the painter Courbet to\r\nappraise their value, he estimated the bronzes alone at $300,000.[1]\r\nM. Thiers' collection of Persian, Chinese, and Japanese curios was\r\nalso almost unique. After the overthrow of the Commune, Madame\r\nThiers and her sister did their utmost to recover such of these\r\ntreasures as had passed into the hands of dealers. Many of these\r\nmen gave back their purchases, and none demanded extravagant prices.\r\nA great deal was recovered, and the house on the Place Saint-Georges\r\nwas rebuilt at the public cost.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Le Figaro.]\r\n\r\nIt was on the 5th of September, 1872, that the last German soldier\r\nquitted France and the five milliards of francs (in our money a\r\nthousand millions of dollars) had been paid.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: When looking over letters and papers concerning this\r\nperiod, I found among them many original notes from M. and Madame\r\nThiers. They all had broad black borders. I learned afterwards\r\nthat Thiers and his family used mourning paper so long as a single\r\nGerman soldier remained on French soil. Thiers' writing was thick\r\nand splashy. He always wrote with a quill pen. Early in life he\r\nhad, like Sir Walter Raleigh, projected a History of the World;\r\nand as he never wrote of anything whose locality he had not seen,\r\nhe had made his preparations to circumnavigate the globe, when\r\nhe was arrested by the state of public affairs while on his way\r\nto Havre.]\r\n\r\nI borrow the words of another writer speaking of this supreme effort\r\non the part of France:--\r\n\r\n\"After the most frightful defeat of modern times, with one third of\r\nher territory in the enemy's hands, with her capital in insurrection,\r\nand her available army all required to restore order, France in\r\neighteen months paid a fine equal to one fourth of the English\r\nNational Debt; elected a _bourgeois_ of genius to her head; obeyed\r\nhim on points on which she disagreed with him; and endured a foreign\r\noccupation without giving one single pretext for real severity....\r\nThe people of France had no visible chiefs; the only two men who\r\nrose to the occasion were M. Thiers and Gambetta. If M. Thiers\r\nshowed tact, wisdom, and above all courage and firmness, in probably\r\nthe most difficult position in which man was ever placed, surely we\r\nmay pause to admire Gambetta.... Daring in all things, under the\r\nEmpire he denounced Napoleonism, and by his eloquence and courage he\r\nguided timid millions and rival factions from the day when Napoleon\r\nIII. was deposed. Under the Empire he had yearned to restore the\r\ntrue life of the nation; when the Empire was overturned he could\r\nnot believe that that life was impaired. He thought it would be\r\neasy for France to rise as one man and drive out the invader. As\r\neach terrible defeat was experienced, he regarded it as only a\r\nmomentary reverse. He had such abounding faith in his cause,--the\r\ncause of France, the cause of French Republicanism,--that he could\r\nnot believe in failure. Of course, to have been a more clear-sighted\r\nstatesman, like M. Thiers, would have been best; but there is something\r\nvery noble in the blind zeal of this disappointed man.\"\r\n\r\nIt moves one to pity to think of Gambetta weeping in the streets\r\nof Bordeaux, as we are told he did, when the bitter news of the\r\nsurrender of Paris made all his labors useless, and dashed to the\r\nground his cherished hopes. Without one word to trouble the flow of\r\nevents that were taking a course contrary to all his expectations,\r\nhe resigned his dictatorship when it could no longer be of service\r\nto his country, and took himself out of the way of intrigues in his\r\nfavor, passing over the Spanish frontier. As soon as the Germans\r\nwere out of France, M. Thiers also was prepared to resign his power.\r\nHe called a National Assembly to determine the form of government.\r\n\r\nThere were several points of primary importance to be settled at\r\nonce; first: should France be a monarchy, or a republic?\r\n\r\nThat she would again become a monarchy was generally anticipated; but\r\nthe Comte de Chambord had, as we have seen, forfeited his chances for\r\nthe moment. If France were a republic, who should be her president?\r\nShould there be a vice-president? Should the president be elected\r\nby the Chamber, or by a vote of the people? Should there be one\r\nChamber, or two?\r\n\r\nM. Thiers was opposed to having any vice-president, and was in\r\nfavor of two Chambers. He vehemently urged the continuance of the\r\nRepublic, saying that a monarchy was impossible. There was but\r\none throne, and there were three dynasties to dispute it. On one\r\noccasion he said: \"Gentlemen, I am an old disciple of the monarchy\r\n[he was probably alluding to the opinions which his mother and his\r\ngrandmother had endeavored to instil into him]. I am what is called\r\na Monarchist who practises Republicanism for two reasons,--first,\r\nbecause he agreed to do so, secondly, because practically he can\r\ndo nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nThe Assembly proclaimed the continuance of the Republic, and likewise\r\nthe continuance of M. Thiers as its president for seven years.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions after this, M. Thiers carried his point with\r\nthe Assembly by threatening to resign; and as the Assembly was\r\nquite aware how difficult it would be to put anyone in his place,\r\nthe threat always resulted in his victory.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause which led to the fall of M. Thiers on May 24,\r\n1873, after he had sat for two years and a month in the presidential\r\nchair, was a dispute concerning the election of M. Charles de Rémusat\r\n(son of the lady who has given her memoirs to the world). M. de\r\nRémusat was the Government candidate for a deputyship vacant in\r\nthe Paris representation. He was at the time Thiers' Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, a personal friend of the president, a distinguished\r\nman of letters, and an old Orleanist converted to Republicanism. The\r\nopposing candidate was M. Barodet, a Radical of extreme opinions.\r\nThe Monarchists also brought forward their candidate. He had only\r\ntwenty-seven thousand votes; but these succeeded in defeating M.\r\nde Rémusat, who had one hundred and thirty-five thousand, while\r\nthe Radicals voted solidly for Barodet, giving him one hundred\r\nand fifty-five thousand.\r\n\r\nThe blame of this defeat was thrown on M. Thiers. The Monarchists,\r\nwho had once called him \"that illustrious statesman,\" now spoke of\r\nhim as \"a fatal old man.\" They attacked him in the Assembly; the\r\nRadicals supported them. M. Thiers was defeated on some measure\r\nthat he wished should pass, and sent in his resignation. It was\r\naccepted by three hundred and sixty-two votes against three hundred\r\nand forty-eight. He had fallen; and yet a _plébiscite_ throughout\r\nthe country would have given a large popular vote in favor of the man\r\n\"who had found France defeated, her richest provinces occupied, her\r\ncapital in the hands of savages, and had concluded peace and restored\r\norder, and found the stupendous sum required for the liberation and\r\norganization of the country, founding the Republic, and bringing\r\norder and prosperity back once more.\" Indeed, the peasants even\r\ncredited him with their good harvests and the revival of spirit\r\nin the army, till they almost felt for him a sentiment of personal\r\nloyalty.\r\n\r\nExpelled from power when seventy-eight years of age, M. Thiers\r\nretired to a little sunny, dusty _entresol_ on the Boulevard\r\nMalesherbes, where the noise and glare greatly disturbed him. At\r\nTours, in the lull of events before the surrender of Paris, he had\r\ncollected books and studied botany. As soon as he was installed\r\non the Boulevard Malesherbes he asked Leverrier, the astronomer, to\r\ncontinue with him the astronomical studies with which at Versailles\r\nhe had indulged himself in brief moments of leisure, remarking\r\nthat he had seen a good deal of the perversity of mankind, and\r\nthat he now wished to refresh himself with the orderly works of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nShortly after this he removed to better quarters, where his rooms\r\nopened on a garden. In this garden he received his friends on Sunday\r\nmornings from seven to nine, attired in a wadded, brown cashmere\r\ndressing-gown, a broad-brimmed hat, a black cravat, patent-leather\r\nshoes, and black gaiters. As he talked, he held his magnifying-glass\r\nin his hand, ready to examine any insect or blade of grass that\r\nmight come under observation.\r\n\r\nOne more great service he rendered to his country. Prince Bismarck,\r\nalarmed by the state of things in France, showed symptoms of intending\r\nto seize Belfort, that fortress in the Vosges which had never\r\nsurrendered to the Germans, and which France had been permitted to\r\nretain. Thiers induced Russia to intervene, and went to Switzerland\r\nto thank Prince Gortschakoff personally for his services on the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThiers died at Saint-Germains four years after his downfall, at\r\nthe age of eighty-two. His last earthly lodging was in the Pavilion\r\nHenri IV. (now an hotel), where Louis XIV. was born.\r\n\r\nBy his will he left the State, not only all his collections, which\r\nso far as possible he had restored, but the numerous historical\r\nmaterials which he had gathered for his works, as well as his house,\r\nafter his wife's death, in the Place Saint-Georges. The collections\r\nare there as he left them; the historical documents have been removed\r\nto the Archives.\r\n\r\nTo Marseilles, his native city, he left his water-color copies of\r\nthe chief works of the great masters in Italy.\r\n\r\nThiers was childless. Whatever may have been the personal relations\r\nin which he stood to his wife, no woman was ever more truly devoted\r\nto the interests of her husband. She seems to have lived but for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPeople in society laughed at her plain dressing and her careful\r\nhousekeeping; but \"her heart dilated with gladness when she felt\r\nthat the eyes of the world were fixed with admiration on M. Thiers.\"\r\nHer manner to him was that of a careful and idolizing nurse, his\r\nto her too often that of a petulant child. She always called him\r\nM. Thiers, he always addressed her as Madame Thiers,--indeed, he\r\nis almost unknown by his name of Adolphe, nor do men often speak\r\nof him simply as Thiers. \"Monsieur Thiers\" he was and will always\r\nbe in history, whose tribunal he said he was not afraid to face.\r\nEven his cards were, contrary to French custom, always printed\r\n\"Monsieur Thiers.\"\r\n\r\nBoth M. and Madame Thiers were very early risers, and both had an\r\ninconvenient habit of falling asleep at inopportune times.\r\n\r\nTo the last, Madame Thiers took a loving interest in Belfort, because\r\nher husband had saved it from the Germans. Its poor were objects\r\nof her especial solicitude. Only an hour before her death, hearing\r\nthat the Maire of Belfort had called, she expressed a wish to see\r\nhim, and endeavored to address him, pointing to a bust of M. Thiers;\r\nbut she was unable to make herself understood; her powers of speech\r\nhad failed her.\r\n\r\nTwo rules M. Thiers never departed from: one was, as he said himself,\r\n\"to defend ferociously the public purse,\" the other, never to give\r\nhouse-room to any but first-rate objects of art. Some of his pictures\r\nwere very dear to him. Several of his bronzes, which were pillaged by\r\nthe Commune and never recovered, were mourned by him as if they had\r\nbeen his friends. He had been wont to call them \"the school-masters\r\nof his soul.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHREE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S.\r\n\r\nMarshal MacMahon, the Duke of Magenta, was of Irish descent, his\r\nancestors having followed James II. into exile, and distinguished\r\nthemselves at the Battle of the Boyne. Their descendant, Patrice\r\n(or Patrick), the subject of this sketch, was the sixteenth of\r\nseventeen children.\r\n\r\nHe was born when French glory was at its height, under the First\r\nEmpire, in the summer of 1806. When he was seventeen he was sent to\r\nthe military school at Saint-Cyr. There his Irish dash and talent\r\nsoon won him renown. In Algeria he acquired fame and fortune and\r\nthe Cross of the Legion of Honor. In 1830 he went to the siege\r\nof Antwerp, at the time when the French insisted on promoting a\r\nrevolution in Belgium, and the moment that enterprise was over,\r\nhe retired to Algeria. At twenty-five he was a captain and had\r\ndistinguished himself at the siege of Constantine, fighting side\r\nby side with the Duc de Nemours and that other French officer of\r\nIrish descent, Marshal Niel. At forty-four he was a general of\r\ndivision, and had seen twenty-seven years of service. The Arabs\r\ncalled him the Invulnerable.\r\n\r\nHe went to the Crimean War, and there led the attack on the Malakoff,\r\nholding his post until the place was won. Devoted to his profession,\r\nhe was diffident in society. He was named a senator by Napoleon\r\nIII. after his return from the Crimea, but declined to take his\r\nseat, refusing at the same time some other proffered honors. He\r\nwas sent back to Algeria at his own request, and stayed there,\r\nfighting the Arabs, for five years. Then, returning to Paris, he\r\ntook his seat in the Senate, where he opposed some of the arbitrary\r\ndecrees of the emperor.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Temple Bar, \"Courts of the three Presidents, Thiers,\r\nMacMahon, and Grévy,\" 1884.]\r\n\r\nIn the Italian War in 1859 he fought with distinguished bravery,\r\nand on the battlefield of Magenta was made a Marshal of France and\r\nDuke of Magenta. After being ambassador at Berlin he was sent to\r\nbear the emperor's congratulations to King William on his accession,\r\nand to attend his coronation. He was again sent to Algeria as its\r\ngovernor-general. He had already married Marie, daughter of the\r\nDuc de Castries. She was very rich, and connected with some of\r\nthe most opulent bankers in Vienna.\r\n\r\nMarshal MacMahon came back to France at the outbreak of the\r\nFranco-Prussian War, and was given the command of the First Army\r\nCorps; but the emperor insisted on commanding his own armies as\r\ngeneral-in-chief. The day before the surrender at Sedan, Marshal\r\nMacMahon had been badly wounded, and had to resign his command\r\nto General Ducrot. Ducrot being also wounded, it became the sad\r\nduty of General Wimpffen to sign the capitulation. Marshal MacMahon\r\nwas taken as a prisoner to Wiesbaden, where he remained till the\r\nclose of the war. He got back to Paris forty-eight hours before\r\nthe outbreak of the Commune. A commander was needed for the forces\r\nof France. M. Thiers chose Marshal MacMahon, who with tears in\r\nhis eyes thanked him for the opportunity of retrieving his lost\r\nreputation and doing service for France. After he had collected\r\nhis army, which it took some weeks to bring back from Germany,\r\nto equip, and to reorganize, his men fought desperately for seven\r\ndays, pushing their way step by step into the heart of the capital,\r\ntill on May 28, 1871, the marshal addressed a proclamation to France,\r\ninforming Frenchmen that the Commune was at an end. He then passed\r\nout of public sight, eclipsed by the superior radiance of Thiers\r\nand Gambetta. But as time went on, and it was determined by the\r\nMonarchists to coalesce with the extreme Radicals and get rid of\r\nM. Thiers, who was laboring to establish a law and order Republic,\r\nthe newspapers of both the Conservative and Radical parties began\r\nto exalt the marshal's merits at the expense of \"that sinister old\r\nman,\" M. Thiers. After six months of this trumpet-blowing by the\r\nopposition Press, the idea was planted in the minds of Frenchmen\r\nthat Marshal MacMahon was the statesman who might bring France\r\nout of all her difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt was ascertained by the Monarchists that Marshal MacMahon would\r\naccept the presidency if it were offered him, and would consider\r\nhimself a stop-gap until such time as France should make up her\r\nmind whether the Comte de Chambord or some one else should be her\r\nking.\r\n\r\nThe attack on M. Thiers was then organized. M. Thiers was defeated.\r\nHe sent in his resignation, and it was accepted by a small majority\r\nin the Chamber. A moment after, Marshal MacMahon was proposed as\r\nhis successor, and immediately elected (May 24, 1873).\r\n\r\nAt this time the parties in the French Chamber were seven, and their\r\npolicy was for two or more of them to combine for any temporary\r\nobject. Legitimists, Orleanists, and Bonapartists formed the Right;\r\nAnarchists, Red Republicans, and decided Republicans formed the\r\nLeft; while the Centre was made up of men of moderate opinions\r\nof all parties who were willing to accept an orderly and stable\r\ngovernment of any kind. This party may be said to represent to\r\nthe present hour the prevailing state of public feeling in France.\r\n\r\nThe three parties on the Left quarrelled fiercely among themselves;\r\nthe three parties on the Right did the same. Both Left and Right,\r\nhowever, were eager to rally the Centre to their side. The coalitions,\r\nhatreds, and misunderstandings of these seven parties constitute\r\nfor eighteen years almost the entire history of the Third Republic.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the Monarchists,--that is, the three parties on the Right--were\r\nstronger than the combined parties on the Left, but not so strong\r\nif the Moderates of the Centre voted with the Left Republicans.\r\nAgain, if the Legitimists, Orleanists, and the Centre should unite,\r\nand the Bonapartists should go over to the Left, the Left would\r\nbe the stronger.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Broglie, an excellent man, grandson of Madame de Staël,\r\nwas made President MacMahon's prime minister. So far the Monarchists\r\nhad prospered. They had command of the president, the Assembly, and\r\nthe army. These were all prepared to accept Henri V., provided he\r\nwould retreat from the position he had taken up in 1871, consent\r\nto become a constitutional sovereign, give up his White Flag, and\r\naccept the Tricolor. The Monarchists appointed a Committee of Nine\r\nto negotiate this matter with the prince at Fröhsdorf; but Marshal\r\nMacMahon gave them this warning: \"If the White Flag is raised against\r\nthe Tricolor, the chassepots will go off of themselves, and I cannot\r\nanswer for order in the streets or for discipline in the army.\"\r\n\r\nWith great difficulty the nine succeeded in procuring an assurance\r\nfrom the Comte de Chambord that he would leave the question of\r\nthe flag to be decided in concert with the Assembly after his\r\nrestoration. Meantime he came to Versailles and remained hidden in\r\nthe house of one of his supporters. Everybody urged him to accept\r\nthe conditions on which alone he could reign, and fulfil the hopes\r\nof his faithful followers. They implored him to ascend the throne as\r\na constitutional sovereign, and to accept the Tricolor, in deference\r\nto the wishes of the people and his friends.\r\n\r\nHe passed an entire night in miserable indecision, walking up and\r\ndown his friend's dining-room, debating with himself whether he\r\nwould give way. It had been arranged that the next day he should\r\npresent himself suddenly in the Assembly, be hailed with acclamation\r\nby his supporters, and be introduced by the marshal-president himself\r\nas Henri Cinq. The building was to be guarded by faithful troops,\r\nthe telegraph was prepared to flash the news through France, the\r\nvery looms at Lyons were weaving silks brocaded with _fleurs de\r\nlys_. But Henri V. could not bring himself to comply. He fled away\r\nfrom Versailles before dawn. \"He is an honest man,\" said M. Thiers,\r\n\"and will not put his flag in his pocket.\" A few days later he\r\npublished at Salzburg a letter in which he protested against the\r\npressure his friends had brought to bear on him. \"Never,\" he said,\r\n\"will I become a revolutionary king,\" by which he meant a king who\r\nreigned under a constitution; never, he protested, would he sacrifice\r\nhis honor to the exigencies of parties; \"and,\" he concluded, \"never\r\nwill I disclaim the standard of Arques and of Ivry!\"\r\n\r\n\"The count,\" said an English newspaper, \"seems to have forgotten\r\nthat Arques and Ivry were Protestant victories.\"\r\n\r\n\"My person,\" continued the count, \"is nothing; my principle is\r\neverything. I am the indispensable pilot, the only man capable\r\nof guiding the vessel into port, because for this I have mission\r\nand authority.\"\r\n\r\nThus ended all chances for Henri V. The Orleans princes, having\r\nconcluded a compact with him as his heirs, felt themselves bound\r\nin honor to refuse to accept any compromise which \"the head of\r\nthe family\" did not approve.\r\n\r\nIt can be easily imagined how provoked and disappointed were all\r\nthose who had rallied to the king's party. There remained nothing to\r\ndo but to strengthen the Republic and to provide it with a permanent\r\nconstitution. A Committee of Thirty was appointed to draw up the\r\ndocument. The constitution was very conservative. It has now been\r\nin force nineteen years, but it has never worked smoothly, and the\r\nobject of the extreme Republicans, who have clamored for \"revision,\"\r\nhas been to eliminate its conservative elements and make it Red\r\nRepublican. It is impossible for a people who change their government\r\nso often to have much respect or love for any constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal-Duke of Magenta had accepted the presidency without any\r\ngreat desire to retain it; nevertheless, he established his household\r\non a semi-royal footing, as though he intended, as some thought, that\r\nthere should be at least a temporary court, to prepare the way for\r\nwhat might be at hand. M. Thiers had been a _bourgeois_ president;\r\nthe marshal was a _grand seigneur_. M. Thiers' servants had been\r\nclothed in black; the marshal's wore gay liveries of scarlet plush,\r\nand gray and silver. When M. Thiers took part in any public ceremony\r\nhe drove in a handsome landau with a mounted escort of Republican\r\nGuards, and his friends (he never called them his _suite_) followed\r\nas they pleased in their own carriages. But the marshal's equipages\r\nwere painted in three shades of green, and lined with pearl-gray\r\nsatin. They were drawn by four gray horses, with postilions and\r\noutriders. To see M. Thiers on business was as easy as it is to\r\nsee the President at the White House. Anybody could be admitted\r\non sending a letter to his secretary. To journalists he was always\r\naccessible, believing himself still to belong to their profession.\r\nBut to approach the marshal was about as hard as to approach a\r\nking, and he hated above all things newspaper writers.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the Shah of Persia came to Paris, and the marshal entertained\r\nhim magnificently. He gave him a torch-light procession of soldiers,\r\na gala performance at the Grand Opera, and a banquet in the Galerie\r\ndes Glaces at Versailles. The Parisians regretted that the visit had\r\nnot been made in M. Thiers' time, when society might have been amused\r\nby stories of how the omniscient little president had instructed the\r\nshah, through an interpreter, as to Persian history and the etymology\r\nof Oriental languages; but society had a good story connected with\r\nthe visit, after all. During the state banquet at Versailles the\r\nshah turned to the Duchess of Magenta, and asked her, in a French\r\nsentence some one had taught him for the occasion, why her husband\r\ndid not make himself emperor.\r\n\r\nThe marshal was content to hold his place as president, and the\r\nDuc de Broglie governed for him, except in anything relating to\r\nmilitary affairs. On these the marshal always had his way.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Broglie's government, which was all in the interest\r\nof the monarchical principle, became distrusted and unpopular.\r\nIn one year twenty-one Republicans and six Bonapartists gained\r\nseats in the Assembly, while the Orleanist and Legitimist parties\r\ngained not one. By 1874 the cause of royalty in France was at a\r\nlow ebb. In this year--a year after the downfall of M. Thiers--the\r\nDuc de Broglie was defeated in the Chamber on some measure of small\r\nimportance; but his defeat turned him summarily out of office. The\r\nLeft Centre--that is, the Republicans from conviction--was the\r\nstrongest of the seven parties. The Republic seemed established\r\non a basis of law and order.\r\n\r\nAccording to the constitution, the president was chosen for seven\r\nyears, with the chance of re-election; the Chamber of Deputies\r\nwas elected for seven years by universal suffrage, but every year\r\none third of its members had to retire into private life or stand\r\nfor a new election. The Senate was chosen by a complicated\r\narrangement,--partly by the Chamber, partly by a sort of electoral\r\ncollege, the members of which were drawn from the councils of\r\ndepartments, the _arrondissements_, and the municipalities of cities.\r\nAs Gambetta said: \"So chosen, it could not be a very democratic\r\nassemblage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrondissement,\" in the political language of our Southern States,\r\nwould be translated electoral districts either in town or country.\r\nIn the Northern States it would mean districts for the cities,\r\ntownships in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker, or President of the Chamber, at Tours, at Bordeaux,\r\nand at Versailles, until a month before the downfall of M. Thiers,\r\nhad been the immaculately respectable M. Jules Grévy, who had entered\r\npublic life in 1848. He had been deposed during the period when\r\nthe Monarchists had strength and felt sure of the throne for Henri\r\nV., and he had been replaced by a M. Buffet. It was M. Buffet who\r\nbecame prime minister on the downfall of the Duc de Broglie. Marshal\r\nMacMahon by no means relished being governed by a cabinet composed\r\nof men of more advanced republican opinions than his own. But it\r\nis useless to go deeper into the parliamentary squabbles of this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThen began the quarrel of which we have read so often in Associated\r\nPress telegrams,--the dispute concerning the _scrutin de liste_ and\r\nthe _scrutin d'arrondissement_. \"Scrutin\" means ballot; \"scrutin\r\nde liste\" means that electors might choose any Frenchman as their\r\ncandidate; \"scrutin d'arrondissement,\" that they must confine their\r\nchoice to some man living in the district for which he wished to\r\nstand. The Left disapproved the _scrutin d'arrondissement_, which\r\ngave too much scope, it said, for local interests to have weight over\r\npolitical issues. In our own country local interests are provided for\r\nby State legislatures, and in elections for Congress the _scrutin\r\nd'arrondissement_ is adopted.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of December, 1875, the National Assembly was dissolved.\r\nConfused, uninteresting, factious as it had been on points of politics,\r\nit had at least taught Frenchmen something of parliamentary tactics\r\nand the practical system of compromise. The American government\r\nis said to be based on compromise. In France, \"all or nothing\"\r\nhad been the cry of French parties from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Left was now Gambetta, who managed matters with\r\ndiscretion and in a spirit of compromise. From this policy his\r\nimmediate followers have been called \"opportunists,\" because they\r\nstood by, watching the course of events, ready to promote their\r\nown plans at every opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe new Assembly proved much too republican to please the marshal.\r\nIn every way his situation perplexed and worried him. He was not\r\na man of eminent ability, and had never been trained to politics.\r\nHe had been used to govern as a soldier. His head may have been a\r\nlittle turned by the flatteries so freely showered on him before\r\nhis election, and he had come to entertain a belief that he was\r\nindispensable to France. He saw himself the protector of order\r\nagainst revolutionary passions, and conceived himself to be adored\r\nas the sole hope of the people. \"Believing this, he could hardly\r\nhave been expected to conform to the simple formulas which govern\r\nthe councils of constitutional kings.\" Moreover, behind the marshal\r\nwas his friend the Duc de Broglie, \"now counselling compromise\r\nand now resistance, but always meditating a sudden blow in favor\r\nof monarchy.\"\r\n\r\nBy the close of 1876 it became so evident that the government of\r\nFrance could not be carried on upon strictly conservative principles\r\nthat even the Duc de Broglie advised the marshal to form a Cabinet\r\nfrom the Left, under the prime ministership of M. Jules Simon.\r\nThis gentleman had been one of the five Jules's in the Committee\r\nof Defence in 1870. He was an upright man, very liberal in his\r\nopinions, and philosophic in his tendencies, which made him especially\r\nunacceptable to Marshal MacMahon.\r\n\r\nSimon formed a ministry, which governed, with perpetual parliamentary\r\ndisputes, till May 16, 1877. On that day Marshal MacMahon sent a\r\nletter to his prime minister, telling him that he did not appear to\r\nhave sufficient support in the Chamber to carry on the government,\r\nand reproaching him with his Radical tendencies. Of course the\r\nminister and his colleagues at once resigned. The marshal then\r\ndissolved the Chamber, and appealed to the people, placing the Duc\r\nde Broglie _ad interim_ at the head of affairs.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the marshal and his friends could do to secure\r\na Conservative majority in the new Chamber, it was largely and\r\nstrongly Republican. There was no help for it; as Gambetta said,\r\nthe marshal must either _se soumettre, ou se démettre_,--choose\r\nsubmission or dismission.\r\n\r\nHe had a passing thought of again dissolving the unruly Chamber,\r\nand governing by the Senate alone. He found, however, that the\r\ncountry did not consider him indispensable, and was prepared to\r\nput M. Thiers in his place if he resigned.\r\n\r\nBut M. Thiers did not live to receive that proof of his country's\r\ngratitude. He died, as we have seen, in the summer of 1877, and\r\nthe next choice of the Republican party was M. Jules Grévy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRESIDENT JULES GRÉVY._]\r\n\r\nFor two years longer the marshal held the reins of government, but\r\nhe resigned on being required to sign a resolution changing the\r\ngenerals who commanded the four army corps. \"In a letter full of\r\ndignity,\" says M. Gabriel Monod, \"and which appeared quite natural\r\non the part of a soldier more concerned for the interests of the\r\narmy than for those of politics, he tendered his resignation. The\r\ntwo Chambers met together, and in a single sitting, without noise\r\nor disturbance, M. Jules Grévy was elected, and proclaimed president\r\nof the French Republic for seven years.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that in 1830, when Charles X. published his ordinances\r\nand placarded his proclamation on the walls of Paris, a young\r\nlaw-student, who was tearing down one of them, was driven off with a\r\nkick by one of the king's officers. The officer was Patrice MacMahon;\r\nthe law-student Jules Grévy.\r\n\r\nM. Grévy was pre-eminently respectable. He was born in the Jura\r\nmountains, Aug. 15, 1813. His father was a small proprietor. Diligence\r\nand energy rather than brilliancy distinguished the young Jules in\r\nhis college career. When his college life ended, he went up to\r\nParis and studied for the Bar. MacMahon's kick roused his pugnacity.\r\nHe went home, took down an old musket, and joined the insurgents,\r\nleading an attack upon some barracks where the fighting was severe.\r\nThe Revolution having ended in a constitutional monarchy, he went\r\ninto a lawyer's office, and plodded on in obscurity for eighteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 he rendered services to the Provisional Government, and\r\nthe farmers of his district in the Jura elected him their deputy.\r\nHe went into the Chamber as an Advanced Republican, and voted for\r\nthe banishment of the Orleans family, for a republic without a\r\npresident, and for other extreme measures. Before long he was elected\r\nvice-president of the Chamber.\r\n\r\nThen came the Empire, and M. Grévy went back to his law-books.\r\nHe and his brother must have prospered at the Bar, for in 1851\r\nthey had houses in Paris, in which after the _coup d'état_ Victor\r\nHugo and his friends lay concealed.\r\n\r\nWhen the emperor attempted constitutional reforms, in 1869, Grévy\r\nwas again elected deputy from the Jura. He acted with dignity and\r\nmoderation, though he voted always with the advanced party. Gambetta\r\nhe personally disliked, having an antipathy to his dictatorial\r\nways. When the National Assembly met at Bordeaux to decide the\r\nfate of France, Grévy was made its Speaker, or president; but when\r\nthe _coup d'état_ in favor of Henri V. was meditated, he was got\r\nrid of beforehand, after he had presided for two turbulent years\r\nover an Assembly distracted and excited. Everyone respected M.\r\nGrévy. There was very little of the typical Frenchman in his\r\ncomposition. He was of middle height, rather stout, with a large\r\nbald, well-shaped head. He was no lover of society, but was a diligent\r\nworker, and his favorite amusements were billiards and the humble\r\ngame of dominoes. His wife was the good woman suited to such a\r\nhusband; but his daughter, his only child, was considered by Parisian\r\nsociety pretentious and a blue-stocking. She married, after her\r\nfather's elevation to the presidency, M. Daniel Wilson, a Frenchman,\r\nin spite of his English name. M. Grévy's Eli-like toleration of\r\nthe sins of his daughter's husband caused his overthrow.\r\n\r\nIn Marshal MacMahon's time there were two points on which he as\r\npresident insisted on having his own way; that is, anything relating\r\nto army affairs, or to the granting civilians the cross of the Legion\r\nof Honor. He did not object to the decoration of civilians, but he\r\ninsisted upon knowing the antecedents of the gentlemen recommended\r\nfor the distinction. Well would it have been for M. Grévy had he\r\nfollowed the example of his predecessor. The marshal would never\r\ngive the cross to a man whom he knew to be a free-thinker. His reply\r\nto such applications always was: \"If he is not a Christian, what\r\ndoes he want with a cross?\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that in 1877, when the marshal thought of resigning\r\nrather than accepting such an advanced Republican as M. Jules Simon\r\nas chief of his Cabinet, he sent for M. Grévy, and asked him\r\npoint-blank: \"Do you want to become president of the Republic?\" \"I\r\nam not in the least ambitious for that honor,\" replied M. Grévy.\r\n\"If I were sure you would be elected in my place, I would resign,\"\r\ncontinued the marshal; \"but I do not know what would happen if I\r\nwere to go.\" \"My strong advice to you is not to resign,\" said M.\r\nGrévy; \"only bring this crisis to an end by choosing your ministers\r\nout of the Republican majority, and you will be pleased with yourself\r\nafterwards for having done your duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are an honest man, M. Grévy; I wish there were more\r\nlike you,\" said the marshal; and having shaken hands with M. Grévy,\r\nhe dismissed him, though without promising to follow his advice.\r\nHe reflected on it that night, however, and adopted it the next\r\nmorning. But when advised to take Gambetta for his minister, he\r\nreplied: \"I do not expect my ministers to go to mass with me or to\r\nshoot with me; but they must be men with whom I can have some common\r\nground of conversation, and I cannot talk with _ce monsieur-là_.\"\r\nIndeed, Gambetta was often shy and awkward in social intercourse,\r\nseldom giving the impression in private life of the powers of burning\r\neloquence with which he could in public move friend or foe. Nor\r\nhad M. Grévy been by any means always in accord with the fiery\r\nSoutherner. At Tours he objected to Gambetta's measures as wholly\r\nunconstitutional. \"You are one of those men,\" retorted Gambetta,\r\n\"who expect to make omelettes without breaking the eggs.\" \"You\r\nare not making omelettes, but a mess,\" retorted M. Grévy.\r\n\r\nBoth the marshal and his successor were sportsmen and gave\r\nhunting-parties, those of the marshal being as much in royal style\r\nas possible. M. Grévy preferred republican simplicity. When he was\r\nallowed, as Speaker of the House, to live in Marie Antoinette's\r\napartments in the Château of Versailles, he might have been seen\r\nany day sauntering about the streets with his hands in his pockets,\r\nor smoking his cigar at the door of a _café_. He had a brougham,\r\nbut he rarely used it. His coachman grumbled at having to follow\r\nhim at a foot-pace when he took long walks into the country. His\r\nservants did not, like the marshal's, wear gray and scarlet liveries,\r\nbut his household arrangements were more dignified and liberal than\r\nthose of M. Thiers. He had a curious way of receiving his friends\r\n_sans cérémonie_. Three mornings in the week his old intimate\r\nassociates,--artists, journalists, deputies, etc.,--entered the\r\npresidential palace unannounced, and went straight to an apartment\r\nfitted up for fencing. There, taking masks and foils, they amused\r\nthemselves, till presently M. Grévy would come in, make the tour\r\nof the room, speak a few words to each, and invite one or two of\r\nthem to breakfast with him.\r\n\r\nBoth M. Grévy and Marshal MacMahon held their Cabinet meetings in\r\nthat _salle_ of the Élysée which is hung round with the portraits\r\nof sovereigns. Opposite to M. Grévy's chair hung a portrait of\r\nQueen Victoria; and it was remarked that he always gazed at her\r\nwhile his ministers discoursed around him. But his happiness, poor\r\nman! was in his private apartments, where his daughter, her husband,\r\nM. Wilson, and his little grandchild made part of his household.\r\n\r\nM. Gréevy gave handsome dinners at the Élysée, and Madame Grévy\r\nand Madame Wilson gave receptions, and occasionally handsome balls.\r\nEverything was done \"decently and in order,\" much like an American\r\npresident's housekeeping, but without show or brilliancy.\r\n\r\nHaving indulged in this gossip about the courts of the presidents\r\n(for much of which I am indebted to a writer in \"Temple Bar\"),\r\nwe will turn to graver history.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Grévy became president, Gambetta succeeded to his place\r\nas president of the Chamber. He did not desire the post of prime\r\nminister. His new position made him the second man in France, and\r\nseemed to point him out as the future candidate for the presidency.\r\n\r\nM. Defavre became chief of the Cabinet, and M. Waddington Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs. But Gambetta, whether in or out of office,\r\nwas the leader of his party, and a sense of the responsibilities\r\nof leadership made him far more cautious and less fiery than he\r\nhad been in former days. Yet even then he had said emphatically:\r\n\"No republic can last long in France that is not based on law,\r\norder, and respect for property.\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1880, however, eighteen months after M. Grévy's elevation\r\nto the presidency, Gambetta became prime minister. He flattered\r\nhimself that he might do great things for France, for he believed\r\nthat he could count on the support of every true Republican. He\r\nwas mistaken. Three months after he accepted office, the Radicals\r\nand the Conservatives combined for his overthrow. He was defeated in\r\nthe Chamber on a question of the _scrutin de liste_, and resigned.\r\n\r\nGambetta's disappointment was very great. He had counted on his\r\npopularity, and had hoped to accomplish great things. He was a\r\nman of loose morals and of declining health, for, unsuspected by\r\nhimself, a disorder from which he could never have recovered, was\r\nundermining his strength; this made him irritable. On the 30th of\r\nAugust, 1882, he was visiting, at a country house near Paris, a\r\nlady of impaired reputation; there he was shot in the hand. The\r\nwound brought on an illness, of which he died in December. It has\r\nnever been known whether the shot was fired by the woman, as was\r\ngenerally suspected, or whether his own pistol, as he asserted,\r\nwas accidentally discharged.\r\n\r\nHe was buried at Père la Chaise, without religious services; but\r\nhis coffin was followed by vast crowds, and all Frenchmen (even\r\nhis enemies, and they were many) felt that his country had lost\r\nan honest patriot and a great man.\r\n\r\nOn the centennial anniversary of the opening act of the French\r\nRevolution, a statue of Gambetta was unveiled in the Place du Carrousel,\r\nthe courtyard of French kings. No future king, if any such should\r\nbe, will dare to displace it. Gambetta's life was a sad one, and\r\nhis death was sadder still. With all his noble qualities,--and\r\nthere are few things nobler in history than the manner in which\r\nhe effaced himself to give place to his rival,--how great he might\r\nhave been, had he learned early to apply his power of self-restraint\r\nto lesser things!\r\n\r\nGambetta wanted Paris to remain the city of cities, the centre of\r\nart, fashion, and culture; and he took up the Emperor Napoleon's\r\npolicy of beautifying and improving it by costly public works.\r\n\"Je veux ma république belle, bien parée\" (\"I want my republic\r\nbeautiful and well dressed\") was a sentence which brought him into\r\ntrouble with the Radicals, who said he had no right to say \"my\r\nrepublic,\" as if he were looking forward to being its dictator.\r\nHe voted for the return of the Communists from New Caledonia, and\r\nduring the last two years of his life these returned exiles never\r\nceased to thwart him and revile him. Some one had prophesied to\r\nhim that this would be the case. \"Bah!\" he answered, \"the poor\r\nwretches have suffered enough. I might have been transported myself,\r\nhad matters turned out differently in 1870.\"[1] Had he lived, it\r\nis probable that in 1886 he would have supplanted M. Grévy. \"Nor,\"\r\nsays one of his friends, \"can it be doubted that, loving the Republic\r\nas he did, and having served it with so much devotion and honesty,\r\nhe would have found in his love a power of self-restraint to keep\r\nhim from courses that might have been hurtful to his own work.\"\r\nFor the establishment of the Republic _was_ principally \"his own\r\nwork.\" He proclaimed its birth, standing in a window of the Hôtel\r\nde Ville in 1870; he gave it a baptism of some glory in the fiery,\r\nthough hopeless, resistance he opposed to the German invasion;\r\nand he kept it standing at a time when it needed the support of\r\na sturdy, vigilant champion. To the end it must be believed that\r\nhe would, as far as in him lay, have preserved it from harm. Not\r\nlong before his death, during a lull in his pain, which for a moment\r\nroused a hope of his recovery, he said to his doctor: \"I have made\r\nmany mistakes, but people must not imagine I am not aware of them;\r\nI often think over my faults, and if things go well I shall try\r\nthe patience of my friends less often. _On se corrige!_\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cornhill Magazine, 1883.]\r\n\r\nWhen Gambetta was dead, the man who stepped into his place was\r\nJules Ferry. He was a lawyer, born in the Vosges in 1832. He had\r\nnever been personally intimate with Gambetta, but he succeeded\r\nto his political inheritance, became chief of his party, secured\r\nthe majority that Gambetta never could get in the Chamber, and\r\ndid all that Gambetta had failed to do.\r\n\r\nHis attention when prime minister was largely devoted to the development\r\nof French industry in colonies. He began a war in Tonquin, he annexed\r\nTunis, and commenced aggressions in Madagascar. All of these enterprises\r\nhave proved difficult, unprofitable, and wasteful of life and money.\r\n\r\nThe position of France with relation to other powers has become\r\nvery isolated. Her best friend, strange to say, is Russia,--the\r\nyoung Republic and the absolute czar! Germany, Austria, and Italy\r\nform the alliance called the Dreibund. But their military force\r\nunited is not quite equal to that of France and Russia combined.\r\nIf Russia ever attacks the three powers of Central Europe on the\r\nEast, it is not to be doubted that France will rush upon Alsace and\r\nLorraine. The mob of Paris, in 1884, put M. Grévy to much annoyance\r\nand embarrassment by hissing and hooting the young king of Spain\r\non his way through the French capital because he had accepted the\r\nhonorary colonelcy of a German regiment, and M. Grévy and his Foreign\r\nMinister had profoundly to apologize. The incident was traceable,\r\nit was said at the time, to the indiscretions of M. Daniel Wilson,\r\nthe president's son-in-law, whose melancholy story remains to be\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nShortly before Gambetta's death, occurred that of the Prince Imperial\r\nin Zululand, and that of the Comte de Chambord in Austria.\r\n\r\nThe son of Napoleon III. had been educated at Woolwich, the West\r\nPoint Academy of England. When the Zulu war broke out, all his\r\nyoung English companions were ordered to Africa, and he entreated\r\nhis mother to let him go. He wanted to learn the art of war, he\r\nsaid, and perhaps too he wished to acquire popularity with the\r\npeople of England, in view of a future alliance with a daughter\r\nof Queen Victoria. The general commanding at the seat of war was\r\nfar from glad to see him. He knew the dangers of savage warfare,\r\nand felt the responsibility of such a charge. For some time he\r\nkept the prince working in an office, but at last permitted him\r\nto go on a reconnoitring expedition, where little danger was\r\nanticipated. There is no page in history so dishonorable to the\r\nvalor and good conduct of an English gentleman as that which records\r\nhow, when surprised by Zulus, the young prince was deserted by his\r\nsuperior officer and his companions, and while trying to mount\r\nhis restive horse, was slain.\r\n\r\nHe left a will leaving his claims (such as they were) to the imperial\r\nthrone of France to his young cousin Victor Napoleon, thus overlooking\r\nthe father of that young prince, Jérôme Napoleon, the famous Plon-Plon.\r\n\r\nThe reconciliation which in 1873 took place between the Comte de\r\nChambord and his distant cousins of the house of Orleans never\r\nresulted in cordial relations, though the Comte de Paris, as his\r\ncousin's heir, visited the Comte de Chambord at Fröhsdorf. The\r\nComtesse de Chambord despised and disliked the family of Orleans,\r\nand the Monarchist party in France still remained divided into\r\nLegitimists and Orleanists, the latter protesting that they only\r\ndesired a constitutional sovereign, and did not hold to the doctrine\r\nof right divine.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Chambord died Aug. 24, 1883. His malady was cancer in\r\nthe stomach, complicated by other disorders. The Orleanist princes\r\nhastened to Fröhsdorf to attend his funeral, but they were so\r\ndisdainfully treated by his widow that they deemed it due to their\r\nself-respect to retire before the obsequies. This is how \"Figaro,\"\r\na leading Legitimist journal in Paris, speaks of the Comte de\r\nChambord:--\r\n\r\n\"He had noble qualities and great virtues. What most distinguished\r\nhim was an intense feeling of royal dignity, which he guarded most\r\njealously by act and word. But we may be permitted to doubt whether\r\nthe fifty-three years he had passed in exile had qualified him\r\nto understand and to sympathize with the great changes in public\r\nopinion in his own country, and the true tendencies of the present\r\nand the rising generation. In his youth he was entirely guided by\r\nothers, but after the _coup d'état_ of 1851 he took things into\r\nhis own hands, and directed his course up to the last moment with\r\na firmness which admitted of neither contradiction nor dispute.\r\nHe sincerely wished to promote liberty; there was nothing in him\r\nof the despot, but he had lived all his life out of France, and\r\ncould not comprehend the preferences and the habits which had grown\r\ninto national feeling. He was kindly, genial, intelligent, witty,\r\ndignified, and affable. He only needed to have been brought up\r\namong his people to have made an admirable sovereign. Had the first\r\nplan of the Revolution of 1830 been carried out, and the young\r\nprince been made king, with Louis Philippe lieutenant-general till\r\nhis majority, it is possible that France might have been spared\r\ngreat tribulations. For our own part,\" continues the \"Figaro,\"\r\n\"we have always looked upon monarchy as the best government for\r\nthe peace, prosperity, and liberty of France; but with the personal\r\npolitics of the Comte de Chambord we could not agree. After all\r\nFrance had gone through, it was necessary to nationalize the king,\r\nand to royalize the nation. M. le Comte de Chambord utterly refused\r\nto yield anything to constitutional ideas and to become what he\r\ncalled the king of the Revolution. It is true that the White Flag\r\nof the Bourbons had been associated with a long line of glories in\r\nFrance, but for a hundred years the Tricolor had been the flag under\r\nwhich French soldiers had marched to victory. It was this matter of the\r\nflag that prevented the success of the plan of restoration in 1873,\r\ntwo months after the Comte de Paris had so patriotically sacrificed\r\nsome of his own most cherished feelings by his reconciliation (for\r\nhis country's sake) with his cousin at Fröhsdorf. The party could\r\ndo nothing without its head. The Orleanist princes would not act\r\nwithout their chief, and the opportunity passed, perhaps never to\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Henri V. never hesitated about the matter of the flag,\" says another\r\nwriter. \"He regarded its color as above everything important. The\r\nquestion of white or tricolor was to him a vital thing. He said:\r\n'Kings have their private points of personal honor like mere citizens.\r\nI should feel myself to be sacrificing my honor, since I was born a\r\nking, if I made any concessions on the subject of the White Flag of\r\nmy family. With respect to other things I may concede; but as to that,\r\nnever, _never!_ The only thing for which I have ever reproached Louis\r\nXVI. was for having for one moment suffered the _bonnet rouge_ to be\r\nplaced upon his head to save his royalty. Now you are proposing to\r\nme to do the same thing. No!' The count had drawn up a constitution\r\nfor France after his own ideas, but he would show it to no man.\r\nNo human being had any power to influence him. But he was heard\r\nto say more than once: 'I will never diminish the power of the\r\nsovereign. I desire liberty and progress to emanate from the king.\r\nRoyalty should progress with the age, but never cease to be itself\r\nin all things.' He deemed the authority he claimed to be his by\r\nright divine; but one may be permitted to think,\" concludes this\r\nwriter, \"that this authority, if it came from Heaven, has been\r\nrecalled there.\"\r\n\r\nFour months before his death he had a touching interview with his\r\nheir, the Comte de Paris, at Fröhsdorf. The count little expected\r\nthen that he would be prevented from taking the part of chief mourner\r\nat the funeral which took place Sept. 1, 1883, at Göritz, when\r\nthe king, who had never reigned, was laid beside Charles X., his\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nWe may best conclude this account of the Comte de Chambord with some\r\ntouching words which he addressed to his disappointed supporters\r\nin 1875:--\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I am reproached for not having chosen to reign when\r\nthe opportunity was offered me, and for having perhaps lost that\r\nopportunity forever. This is a misconception. Tell it abroad boldly.\r\nI am the depositary of Legitimate Monarchy. I will guard my birthright\r\ntill my last sigh. I desire royalty as my heritage, as my duty,\r\nbut never by chance or by intrigue. In other times I might have\r\nbeen willing (as some of my ancestors have been) to recover my\r\nbirthright by force of arms. What would have been possible and\r\nreasonable formerly, is not so now. After forty years of revolution,\r\ncivil war, invasion, and _coups d'état_, the monarchy I represent\r\ncan only commend itself to Europe and the French people as one of\r\npeace, conciliation, and preservation. The king of France must\r\nreturn to France as a shepherd to his fold, or else remain in exile.\r\nIf I must not return, Divine Providence will bear me witness before\r\nthe French people that I have done my duty with honest intentions.\r\nIn the midst of the prevailing ignominies of the present age it\r\nis well that the life and policy of an exiled king should stand\r\nout white in all their loyalty.\"\r\n\r\nThere was little of general interest in French politics during the\r\nremaining years of M. Grévy's first administration, which ended\r\nearly in 1886. He was the first French president who had reached\r\nthe end of his term. He was quietly re-elected by the joint vote\r\nof the two Chambers, not so much because he was popular as because\r\nthere seemed no one more eligible for the position. He had not had\r\nmuch good fortune in his administration. M. Ferry's colonization\r\nschemes had cost great sums of money and had led to jealousies\r\nand disputes with foreign nations. French finances had become\r\nembarrassed. The French national debt in 1888 was almost twice\r\nas great as that of England, and the largest additions to it were\r\nmade during M. Grévy's presidency, when enormous sums were spent\r\non public works and on M. Ferry's colonial enterprises. The mere\r\ninterest on the debt amounts annually to fifty millions of dollars,\r\nand every attempt at reduction is frustrated by the Chambers, which\r\nare unwilling to approve either new taxes or new loans.\r\n\r\nThe two principal points of interest during the latter years of\r\nM. Grévy's first term of office concerned the persecution of the\r\nChurch and the persecution of the princes of the house of Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe Republic began by taking down the crucifixes in all public\r\nplaces, such as court-rooms, magistrates' offices, and public schools;\r\nfor in France men swear by holding up a hand before the crucifix,\r\ninstead of by our own irreverent and dirty custom of \"kissing the\r\nbook.\" Then the education of children was made compulsory; but\r\nschools were closed that had been taught by priests, monks, or nuns.\r\nNext, sisters of charity were forbidden to nurse in the hospitals,\r\ntheir places being supplied by women little fitted to replace them.\r\n\r\nAs to the Orleans princes, in 1886, the year of M. Grévy's second\r\nelection, they were summarily ordered to quit France; not that they\r\nhad done anything that called for exile, but because Prince Napoleon\r\n(who called himself the Prince Imperial and head of the Bonaparte\r\ndynasty) had put forth a pamphlet concerning his pretensions to\r\nthe imperial throne. This led to the banishment of all members\r\nof ex-royal families from French soil, and their erasure from the\r\narmy list, if they were serving as French soldiers.\r\n\r\nThis decree was particularly hard upon the Duc d'Aumale, who was a\r\nFrench general, and had done good service under Chanzy and Gambetta\r\nin the darkest days of the calamities of France.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Paris deeply felt the outrage. He gave the world to\r\nunderstand that he had never conspired against the French Republic\r\nwhile living on his estates in France, but felt free to do so after\r\nthis aggression.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Aumale avenged himself by an act of truly royal magnificence.\r\nHe published part of his will, bequeathing to the French Institute, of\r\nwhich he was a member, that splendid estate and palace of Chantilly\r\nwhich he had inherited from his godfather, the old Duke of Bourbon.\r\nWith its collections, its library, its archives, and its pictures,\r\nthe gift is valued at from thirty-five to forty millions of francs.\r\nThe revenue of the estate is to be spent in enriching the collections,\r\nin encouraging scientific research, in pensioning aged authors,\r\nartists, and scientific discoverers.\r\n\r\n\"It is the grandest gift,\" says M. Gabriel Monod, \"ever given to\r\na country. It is worthy of a prince who joins to the attractive\r\ngrace of noble breeding and the finest qualities of a soldier,\r\nthe talents of a man of letters, the learning of a scholar, and\r\nthe taste of an artist.\"\r\n\r\nM. Grévy--_le vieux_, \"the old fellow,\" as his Parisians irreverently\r\ncalled him--was deeply attached to his daughter, whose husband,\r\nM. Daniel Wilson, a presumptuous, speculative person, had made\r\nhimself obnoxious to society and to all the political parties.\r\nThis man lived at the Élysée with his family, and made free use of\r\npresidential privileges. It is said that by using the president's\r\nright of franking letters for his business affairs, he saved himself\r\nin postage forty-thousand francs per annum. He also made use of\r\ninformation that he obtained as son-in-law of the president to\r\nfurther his own interests, and once or twice he got M. Grévy into\r\ntrouble by the unwarrantable publication of certain matters in a\r\nnewspaper of which he was the proprietor. Besides this he was at\r\nthe head of a great number of financial schemes, whose business\r\nhe conducted under the roof of the Élysée. Before he married\r\nMademoiselle Grévy, a _conseil de famille_ had deprived him of\r\nany control over his property till he came of age, on account of\r\nhis recklessness; but he was what in America we call \"a smart man,\"\r\nand M. Grévy was very much attached to him.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of 1887 a person who considered himself defrauded\r\nin a nefarious bargain he was trying to make with an adventuress,\r\ndenounced to the police of Paris a Madame Limouzin, to whom he\r\nhad paid money on her promise to secure for him the decoration of\r\nthe Legion of Honor. He wanted it to promote the sale of some kind\r\nof patent article in which he was interested. To the astonishment\r\nof the police, when they raided the residence of Madame Limouzin,\r\nletters were found compromising two generals,--General Caffarel,\r\nwho had been high in the War Department when General Boulanger was\r\nminister, and General d'Andlau, author of a book, much commended\r\nby military authorities, on the siege of Metz.\r\n\r\nGeneral Caffarel was a gallant old officer, and it is said the\r\nscene was most piteous when, as part of his punishment, the police\r\ntore from his coat his own decoration of the Legion of Honor. The\r\nWar Minister tried to smother the scandal and to save the generals,\r\nbut it got into the public prints, with many exaggerations. General\r\nd'Andlau took to flight. The police arrested Madame Limouzin, her\r\naccomplice, Madame Ratazzi, and several other persons. The public grew\r\nvery much excited. It was said that state secrets were given over to\r\npillage, that they were sold to the Germans, that the Government was\r\nat the mercy of thieves and jobbers. \"One figure,\" wrote M. Monod,\r\n\"stood out from the rest as a mark for suspicion. It was that of M.\r\nDaniel Wilson. He had never been popular with frequenters of the\r\nÉlysée. He was a rich man, both on his own and his wife's side,\r\nand was an able man and a man of influence in business affairs. He\r\nhad been Under-Secretary of Finance and President of the Committee\r\nof the Budget.\" Many thought he had the best chance of any man for\r\nsucceeding M. Grévy as president of France. He was, however, one of\r\nthose unquiet spirits who may be found frequently among speculators\r\nand financiers. He had no scruple about using his position to promote\r\nhis own business interests and the interests of the schemes in which\r\nhe was engaged, nor did he hesitate to give useful information\r\nto leaders who favored his own views in the Chambers and were in\r\nopposition to the ministers he disliked. Thus the son-in-law of the\r\npresident intrigued against the president's ministers, and Jules\r\nFerry, leader of the Republican law and order party in the Chamber,\r\nand his followers, could not forgive him for having thus betrayed\r\nthem. Wilson belonged to the advanced section of the Republican\r\nparty, the Reds; but he was not so popular with them that they were\r\nunwilling to attack him, provided they could thereby get rid of\r\nM. Grévy, and put a more advanced Republican in his place.\r\n\r\nNo positive accusation, however, in the matter of Madame Limouzin\r\ncould have been brought against M. Wilson, had it not been discovered\r\nby that lady's counsel that two of the letters seized and held as\r\nevidence--letters from M. Wilson to Madame Limouzin--were written on\r\npaper manufactured after their date,--an incident not unfamiliar to\r\nreaders of old-fashioned English novels. The real letters, therefore,\r\nhad undoubtedly been abstracted, and replaced by others of a less\r\ncompromising kind.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry, which up to the time of this discovery had endeavored\r\nto keep the name of the president's son-in-law from being connected\r\nwith the sale of decorations of the Legion of Honor, was obliged\r\nto authorize his prosecution; and the Prefect of Police, who was\r\nsuspected of having given back to M. Wilson his own letters, was\r\nforced to resign.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is a similar incident in Balzac's \"Cousin Pons.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen the trial of M. Wilson and the prefect came on, they were\r\nacquitted, not by a verdict of Not Guilty, but because the French\r\nCode contained no clause that constituted it an offence for a man to\r\nobtain possession of his own letters. The judge, when he acquitted\r\nthe accused, stated that there was no doubt whatever of the\r\nsubstitution. Then from all sides information began to pour in from\r\npeople who had paid money to M. Wilson to procure them ministerial\r\nor presidential favors, and such disclosures could not but reflect\r\non M. Grévy. Instantly his enemies seized their opportunity. For\r\nonce, Monarchists and Anarchists united and endeavored to force\r\nthe president to resign; but the old man stood by his son-in-law\r\nin his hour of adversity, and would not go.\r\n\r\nThen the coalition changed its base, and attacked M. Rouvier, the\r\nprime minister. He was outvoted in the Chamber on some insignificant\r\nquestion; and having no parliamentary majority, he was forced to\r\nresign. By no efforts could M. Grévy get anyone to take his place.\r\nOnce he thought he had persuaded M. Clemenceau, a Radical leader,\r\nto form a ministry; but his party gave him to understand that they\r\nwould not support him.\r\n\r\nThe president, then seventy-five years of age, was in a position\r\nin which anyone but a partisan political opponent must have been\r\nmoved to pity him. He had been so long and so loudly extolled for\r\nhis extreme respectability and his austere virtues that he had\r\nnever dreamed that public opinion on such a point as this could turn\r\nagainst him. He could not endure the idea of being dismissed with\r\ncontempt less than two years after his re-election to the presidency\r\nby the unanimous vote of all Republicans. He was willing to go,\r\nbut he did not choose to be forced to go by the brutal summons of\r\nan infuriated public. Yet France, pending his decision, was without\r\na government. Something had to be done. He employed every device to\r\ngain time. He had interviews with men of various parties. He grew\r\nmore and more care-worn and aged. His troubles showed themselves in\r\nhis carriage and his face. \"By turns he was insinuating, eloquent,\r\nlively, pathetic. He showed a suppleness and a tenacity of purpose\r\nthat amazed those brought into contact with him. If he could but\r\ngain time, he hoped that the Republicans would disagree about his\r\nsuccessor, and decide to rally round him; but at last he was forced\r\nto send in his resignation. He did so Dec. 1, 1887, in a message\r\nwhich, by the confusion of its language, betrayed the anguish of\r\nhis mind.\" A few days after giving up his quarters at the Élysée\r\nas president of the Republic, he was stricken down by paralysis.\r\n\r\nWhen the resignation of M. Grévy had been accepted, came the question,\r\nWho should succeed him? If the Republican party split and failed to\r\nchoose a president, the Monarchists might seize their opportunity.\r\nThe candidate most acceptable to the Moderate Republicans was M.\r\nJules Ferry, but he was unpopular with the Radicals. He had belonged\r\nto the Committee of Defence and the Government of Versailles which\r\nhad put down the Commune. His colonial policy had not been a success,\r\nand he was known to have no toleration for the Reds. Mobs collected\r\nin the streets shouting \"À bas Ferry!\" He was accused of being\r\nthe candidate of the Comte de Paris, of the pope, of Bismarck. He\r\nwas \"Ferry the traitor! Ferry the Prussian! Ferry the clerical!\r\nFerry the Orleanist!\" The Radicals, with the ex-Communist, General\r\nEudes, at their head, swore to take up arms if Ferry were elected\r\nby the Chambers. The Moderate Republicans were not strong enough,\r\nwithout help, to carry his election. It was a case when a \"dark\r\nhorse\" was wanted, an obscure man, against whom nothing was known.\r\n\r\nThe Radicals proposed two candidates,--M. De Freycinet, who, though\r\nnot a Radical, was thought weak enough to be ruled by them, and M.\r\nFloquet. But the Moderates would not lend their aid to elect either\r\nof these men. At last both parties united on M. Sadi-Carnot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRESIDENT SADI-CARNOT._]\r\n\r\nThere were two reasons for his election: the first lay in his name;\r\nhe was the grandson of Lazare Carnot, elected deputy in 1792 to\r\nthe National Convention from Arras, at the same time as his friend\r\nRobespierre. This man and Robespierre had belonged to the same\r\nLiterary Society in Arras,--a club into which no one could be admitted\r\nwithout writing a love-song.[1] Lazare Carnot was the good man of\r\nthe Revolution. Not a stain rests upon his character. He organized\r\nthe glorious armies of the Republic, and was afterwards one of the\r\nmembers of the Directory. His son, Hippolyte Camot, as the oldest\r\nmember in the Senate in 1887, had the duty of announcing to his own\r\nson, Sadi-Carnot, his election to the highest office in the gift\r\nof his countrymen. M. Hippolyte Carnot was a man of high character,\r\nwho during a long life had filled many public offices. He was also\r\na man of letters, and wrote a Life of Barère,--a book that will be\r\nbest remembered by having come under the lash of Macaulay. Every cut\r\ninflicted upon Barère tells, and we delight in its severity.\r\n\r\nThe second reason for Sadi-Carnot's election was the popularity\r\nhe acquired from its being supposed that when he was at the head\r\nof the Committee of Finance he had resisted some illegal demands\r\nmade on the Treasury by M. Wilson. The demands were resisted, it\r\nis true, but not more by M. Carnot than by his colleagues. \"He\r\nwas made president of the French Republic,\" some one said, \"for\r\nan act of integrity he had never committed, and for giving himself\r\nthe trouble to be born, like any heir of royalty.\"\r\n\r\nHe is a good man, who has made no enemies, either in public or\r\nprivate life. It may also be added that he seems to have attracted\r\nfew personal friends. The Republic has grown in strength, and factious\r\nopposition has decreased during his administration. His republicanism\r\nis not advanced or rabid. He is rigidly honest. He has a charming\r\nwife, who, though slightly deaf, enjoys society and gives brilliant\r\nreceptions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Robespierre's in the \"Editor's Drawer,\" Harper's\r\nMagazine, 1889.]\r\n\r\nPoor M. Grévy passed away into sorrow and obscurity. He took up\r\nhis residence on his estate in the Department of the Jura, where,\r\nin September, 1891, he died. M. Wilson appears first to have made\r\nall his own relations rich, and then by speculations to have ruined\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the disastrous end of M. Grévy we must remember that\r\nthe scandal which caused his fall, after so many years of honorable\r\nservice for his country, amounts, so far as he was concerned, to\r\nvery little. The only fault of which he can be accused was that\r\nof too great toleration of the speculative propensities of his\r\nson-in-law. It was proved, indeed, that there were agencies in the\r\nhands of disreputable persons in Paris for the purchase and sale\r\nof influence and honors, but there was little or no evidence that\r\nthese agencies had had any influence with the public departments. The\r\nexistence of such agencies under the Empire would have excited little\r\ncomment. That the trials of Madame Limouzin, General Caffarel, and\r\nM. Wilson so excited the public and produced such consequences,\r\nmay be proof, perhaps, of a keener sense of morality in the Parisian\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nSome one said of M. Grévy that he was a Radical in speech and a\r\nModerate in action, so that he pleased both parties. The strongest\r\naccusation against him was his personal love of economy, and his entire\r\nindifference to show, literature, or art. It was also considered a\r\nfault in him as a French president that he showed little inclination\r\nto travel. Socially, the polite world accused him of wearing old\r\nhats and no gloves. On cold days he put his hands in his pockets,\r\nwhich in the eyes of some was worse than putting them for his own\r\npurposes into the pockets of other people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _GENERAL BOULANGER._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BOULANGER.\r\n\r\nUp to 1886 the name of General Boulanger commands no place upon\r\nthe page of history. After that year it was scattered broadcast.\r\nFor four years it was as familiar in the civilized world as that\r\nof Bismarck.\r\n\r\nA new word was coined in 1886 to meet a want which the general's\r\nimportance had created. That word was _boulangisme_, though it\r\nwould be hard to give it a definition in the dictionary. We can\r\nonly say that it meant whatever General Boulanger might be pleased\r\nto attempt.\r\n\r\nGeorge Ernest Jean Marie Boulanger was born in the town of Rennes,\r\nin Brittany, in 1837.[1] His father had been a lawyer, and was\r\nhead of an insurance company. He spent the latter days of his life\r\nat Ville-d'Avray, near Paris; and as he did not die till 1884, he\r\nlived to see his son a highly considered French officer, though he\r\nhad not then given promise of being a popular hero and a world-famous\r\nman. General Boulanger's mother was named Griffith; she was a lady\r\nbelonging apparently to the upper middle class in Wales. She had\r\na great admiration for George Washington, and the future French\r\nhero received one of his names from the American \"father of his\r\ncountry.\" In his boyhood Boulanger was always called George; but\r\nwhen he came of age he preferred to call himself Ernest, which\r\nis the baptismal name by which he is generally known.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Turner, Life of Boulanger.]\r\n\r\nIn 1851 his parents took him to England to the Great Exhibition.\r\nHe afterwards passed some months with his maternal relatives at\r\nBrighton, and was sent to school there; but he had such fierce\r\nquarrels with the English boys in defence of his nationality that\r\nthe experiment of an English education did not answer. At the age of\r\nseventeen he was admitted to the French military school at Saint-Cyr,\r\nand two years later was in Algeria, as a second lieutenant in a\r\nregiment of Turcos. His experiences in Africa were of the kind\r\nusual in savage warfare; but he became a favorite with his men,\r\nwhom he cared for throughout his career with much of that fatherly\r\ninterest which distinguished the Russian hero, General Skobeleff.--\r\n\r\nWhen the war with Italy broke out, in 1859, Boulanger and his Turcos\r\ntook part in it. He was severely wounded in his first engagement,\r\nand lay long in the hospital, attended by his mother. He received,\r\nhowever, three decorations for his conduct in this campaign, in\r\nwhich he was thrice wounded. On the last occasion, as he lay in\r\nhospital, he received a visit of sympathy from the Empress Eugénie,\r\nthen in the very zenith of her beauty and prosperity.\r\n\r\nBoulanger's next service was in Tonquin, where on one occasion\r\nhe fought side by side with the Spaniards, and received a fourth\r\ndecoration, that of Isabella the Catholic.\r\n\r\nHe was next assigned to home duty at Saint-Cyr; and when the terrible\r\nwar of 1870 broke out, and all the cadets were drafted into the\r\narmy as officers, he was made major of a regiment, which was at\r\nMézières, on the Belgian frontier, when MacMahon and the emperor\r\nsurrendered at Sedan. Boulanger and his command escaped with Vinoy's\r\ntroops from the disaster, and got back to Paris, where he kept\r\nhis men in better order during the siege than any other officer.\r\nThey took part in the sortie made to join Chanzy's Army of the\r\nLoire, in November, 1870, and in a skirmish with the Prussians\r\nhe was again badly wounded. When the Prussian army entered Paris\r\non March 5, 1871, Boulanger and the regiment under his command\r\nhad the unpleasant duty of guarding the streets along their line\r\nof march to insure them a safe passage.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 when thirty-seven years of age, Boulanger was a colonel,\r\nwith the breast of his uniform covered with decorations; but he had\r\ntaken no part whatever in politics, and was not known to have any\r\npolitical views, save that he called himself a fervent Republican,\r\nand personally resented any aristocratic assumptions on the part\r\nof inferior officers.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 he was sent by the French Government to the United States,\r\nin company with the descendants of Lafayette and Rochambeau, to\r\nattend the Yorktown celebration. Amongst all the French delegation\r\nBoulanger was distinguished by his handsome person and agreeable\r\nmanners, while his knowledge of English made him everywhere popular.\r\nHe was already married to his cousin, Mademoiselle Renouard, and\r\nhad two little daughters, Hélène and Marcelle.\r\n\r\nWhen the Minister of War gave Boulanger his appointment on the\r\nmission to Yorktown, he cautioned him that he must not shock the\r\nquiet tastes of American republicans by wearing too brilliant uniforms.\r\nFortunately Colonel Boulanger did not accept the hint, and on all\r\npublic occasions during his visit to this country he attracted the\r\nadmiration of reporters and spectators as the handsomest man in\r\nthe French group, wearing the most showy uniform, with the greatest\r\nnumber of glittering decorations. He was tall, with handsome auburn\r\nbeard and hair, and very regular features. Even in caricatures\r\nthe artist has been obliged to represent him as very handsome.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to France, Boulanger was sent to Tunis,--a State\r\nrecently annexed by the French, who were jealous of the power acquired\r\nby Great Britain on the southern shores of the Mediterranean by her\r\nprotectorate in Egypt. Here Boulanger's desire to conduct things\r\nin a military way led to disputes with the civil authorities, and\r\nhe returned to France in 1885, where M. de Freycinet, then head of\r\na new Cabinet, made him Minister of War. He at once set to work\r\nto reform the army. He told his countrymen that if they ever hoped\r\nto take revenge upon the Germans (or rather _revanche_; for the\r\nwords do not mean precisely the same thing), they must have their\r\narmy in a much better state of preparation than it was in 1870.\r\nInstantly a cry arose in France that General Boulanger was the man\r\nwho sought a war with Germany, and who would lead French armies\r\nto the reconquest of Alsace and Lorraine. The French peasantry have\r\nnever been able to accept the loss of Alsace and Lorraine as an\r\naccomplished fact; they look on the retention of those provinces\r\nby the Germans as a temporary arrangement until France can at the\r\nright moment wrest them out of her powerful rival's hand.\r\n\r\nBoulanger's popularity rose to fever-heat. The Boulanger March,\r\nwith its song, \"En revenant de la revue,\" was played and sung in\r\nall the _cafés chantants_ of Paris. The general rode a black horse\r\nas handsome as himself. Some one has said, \"As a political factor,\r\nBoulanger was born of a horse and a song.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1886 he advocated the exile of the Orleans princes and the erasure\r\nof the Duc d'Aumale's name from the list of French generals. For\r\nthis he was reproached with ingratitude to the duke, who had once\r\nbeen his commanding officer. His own letter of thanks for kindness,\r\nfavors, and patronage was produced, and Boulanger could only defend\r\nhimself by pronouncing it a forgery.\r\n\r\nHe made many changes in army regulations, which increased his popularity\r\nwith the army. One was all order to the men to wear their beards,\r\nand as in the French army soldiers had always been obliged to shave\r\nexcept when on active service, this was interpreted, in the excited\r\nstate of public feeling, into an intimation of the probability of\r\na speedy declaration of war. As War Minister, the general also\r\nextended the time when soldiers on leave might stay out at night,\r\nand relieved them from much of the heavy weight that on the march\r\nthey had had to carry. He broke up certain semi-aristocratic clubs\r\nin the regiments which controlled army opinion, and gave more weight\r\nto the sentiments of the sub-officers.\r\n\r\nBut before long the Ministry, in which he represented the War\r\nDepartment, came to an end,--as, indeed, appears to have been the\r\nfate of all the ministries under the administration of M. Grévy.\r\nNo policy, no reforms, could be carried out under such frequent\r\nchanges. The popular cry was that the popular favorite must retain\r\nhis portfolio as War Minister in the new Cabinet; and this occasioned\r\nconsiderable difficulty. The general had begun to be feared as a\r\npossible dictator. His popularity was immense; but what his place\r\nmight be in politics no one could precisely tell. That he was the\r\nidol of the nation was certain; but was he a Radical of the Belleville\r\ntype, or a forthcoming Napoleon Bonaparte,--an Imperialist on his\r\nown account, or a Jacobin?\r\n\r\nThe fall of the second Ministry in which he served put him out\r\nof office, and the War Minister who succeeded him proceeded to\r\nbid for popularity by fresh reforms, which the Radical Deputies\r\nthought might be acceptable to the people. Those who deal with\r\nthe French peasant should never lose sight of the fact that the\r\npeace and prosperity of himself and of his household stand foremost\r\nin his eyes. The Frenchman, as we depict him in imagination or in\r\nfiction, is as far as possible from the French peasant. If ideas\r\ncontrary to his selfish interests ever make their way into his\r\nmind, they are due to the leaven of old French soldiers scattered\r\nthrough the villages. So when the new Minister of War proposed, and\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies passed, an ordinance that made it illegal\r\nto buy a substitute, and required every Frenchman, from eighteen to\r\ntwenty-one years of age, to serve in the army, the peasant found\r\nsmall consolation for the loss of his sons' services in the thought\r\nthat the son of a duke must serve as well as the son of a laborer.\r\nBoulanger had introduced no such measure. \"Vive le Général Boulanger!\"\r\n\r\nAnother measure, passed about the same time, brought great trouble\r\ninto families. It was a law making education compulsory, and was\r\nloaded with vexatious and arbitrary regulations. Every child privately\r\neducated had to pass, semi-annually, a strict examination before\r\ncertain village authorities. This gave rise in families to all\r\nsorts of tribulations. France is not exactly a land of liberty;\r\npersonal liberty is sacrificed to efforts to enforce equality.\r\n\r\nGeneral Boulanger after his loss of office was given the command\r\nof the Thirteenth Army Corps, and was sent into a sort of exile\r\nat its headquarters at Clermont-Ferrand. At the railroad-station\r\nin Paris a great crowd awaited him on the day of his departure.\r\nIt broke down the barriers, and delayed in-coming and out-going\r\ntrains, as it pressed around him. At first the general seemed pleased\r\nby this evidence of his popularity; then he began to feel the truth\r\nof what a friend whispered to him, \"These twenty thousand men will\r\nmake you forty thousand enemies,\" and he grew embarrassed and annoyed\r\nby the demonstration. Finally he mounted a locomotive, and made\r\na brief speech to the people; then the train steamed out of the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThe exile of the general to Clermont-Ferrand, and the harsh measures\r\ntaken against him by the man who succeeded him in the War Office,\r\ncaused his popularity with the populace daily to increase. He was\r\nfelt to be a power in the State, and this, when he perceived it,\r\nawakened his ambition.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1887, when all parties in France were anticipating\r\nthe resignation of M. Grévy after the exposure of his son-in-law,\r\nthe majority of Frenchmen, outside the Chamber of Deputies, dreaded\r\nthe election of M. Jules Ferry to his place, and prophesied that\r\nit would be the signal for another civil war. This was the opinion\r\nheld (rightly or wrongly) by M. Grévy himself, by General Boulanger,\r\nand by the Comte de Paris. By the last day of November, when it\r\nseemed impossible for M. Grévy to retain office, because no leader\r\nof influence in the Chamber would help him to form a ministry,\r\nBoulanger, who had come up to Paris, met a small party of his friends,\r\nincluding M. Clemenceau, leader of the Radical party, and Rochefort,\r\nthe leader of the Radical press, at dinner at the house of M. and\r\nMadame Laguerre.[1] M. Laguerre was a deputy who supported Boulanger\r\nin the Chamber against his enemies. Two gentlemen present had that\r\nafternoon seen M. Grévy, who had implored them to find some leader\r\nwho would form a ministry; already had M. Clemenceau been thought\r\nof, but he was undecided. It was evident that if he would secure\r\nthe out-of-doors support of Boulanger's popularity, his ministry\r\nmust include Boulanger. It seemed equally certain that if it did\r\nso, it would be beset by enemies in the Chamber. In the midst of a\r\nheated discussion on the subject, General Boulanger about midnight\r\nwas mysteriously called away.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See \"Les Coulisses du Boulangisme,\" published in \"Figaro,\"\r\nand attributed to M. Mermieux.]\r\n\r\nThe person who summoned him was the editor of the \"Cocarde,\" the\r\nBoulangist newspaper, who had been sounded that afternoon by an agent\r\nof the Comte de Paris to know if it were probable that Boulanger\r\nwould join the Monarchists to defeat the chances of Jules Ferry. The\r\nparty of the Comte de Paris had recently gathered strength both by\r\nthe death of the Comte de Chambord and that of the Prince Imperial.\r\nBut it was also divided. There were those who called themselves\r\nof the old school, who held to the high-minded traditions which\r\nhad caused M. Thiers to say to one of them in 1871, \"You are of\r\nall parties the most honest,--I do not say the most intelligent,\r\nbut the most honest;\" and the men of the new school,--men of the\r\nclose of the century, as they called themselves,--who thought all\r\nmeans good that led to a good end, and were for energetic action.\r\nTo this party belonged the Comtesse de Paris, daughter of the Duc\r\nde Montpensier and of the Infanta Luisa of Spain. She had been\r\nknown to say emphatically: \"I don't like people who are always\r\ngoing to do something to-morrow,--like the Comte de Chambord; such\r\nprinces die in exile.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Aumale, on the contrary, despised crooked ways; and the\r\nhope of an intrigue or alliance with General Boulanger was not\r\nnamed to him by his nephew, especially as there was good reason\r\nto think he would never have consented to make a useful instrument\r\nof the man who had so ill-treated him when Minister of War.\r\n\r\nThe idea, however, had suddenly presented itself to the agents\r\nof the Comte de Paris (if it had not been previously suggested\r\nto him) that General Boulanger might be won over to play the part\r\nof General Monk, or failing this, that he might not be unwilling\r\nto ally himself with the Monarchists to defeat the election of\r\nM. Ferry.\r\n\r\nIt was to hold an interview with the gentleman who represented\r\nthe cause of the Comte de Paris that Boulanger was summoned from\r\nthe conference going on at M. Laguerre's.\r\n\r\nThe Royalist agent proposed that M. Grévy should be retained as\r\npresident, and promised that his party in the Chamber would support\r\nany ministry which should include General Boulanger, and of which he\r\nshould be virtually the head. In return, Boulanger was to give his\r\nsupport to an appeal to the people, to see what form of government\r\nFrance would prefer. It was added that if Boulanger were Minister\r\nof War, he could do what he pleased with the army; and thus France,\r\nwell managed, might change from a republic to a monarchy by the\r\nwill of the people and without civil war.\r\n\r\nThe general listened quietly to these suggestions. \"There is nothing\r\nyou could ask that would be too much to reward the services you\r\nwould render to our country,\" said the agent of the Royalists;\r\n\"and remember that the highest fortunes under a Republic are the\r\nmost unstable. Give us your word to do what we ask, and then at\r\nleast M. Ferry will never be president.\" \"I give you my word,\"\r\nsaid Boulanger. But the other then suggested that so important an\r\narrangement must be ratified by some person higher in the confidence\r\nof the Comte de Paris than himself; and he went in haste for the\r\nBaron de Makau. That gentleman showed General Boulanger a letter from\r\nthe Comte de Paris, giving him full powers as his representative.\r\nThe general was to support the proposal for a popular vote for or\r\nagainst the restoration of monarchy, and to use his influence with\r\nthe people in its favor. If monarchy were restored, he was to be made\r\nhead of the army. After a long conversation the general departed,\r\npromising to sound the chiefs of the Radicals, and ascertain which\r\nof them would be most available to carry out the plan.\r\n\r\nBut to his friend the editor of the \"Cocarde,\" who seemed alarmed\r\nat the extent of his promises, he said, as soon as they were alone\r\ntogether, \"I would do anything to avoid civil war and the election\r\nof Ferry; but what fools these people must be to put themselves\r\nin my power!\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke no more till they returned to the house where they had\r\nleft the dinner-party. The discussion was going on as before, only\r\nM. Clemenceau had made up his mind that he would not undertake\r\nto form a ministry, and M. Andrieux had been summoned from his\r\nbed to know if he would do so. He expressed his willingness to\r\nundertake the task, but said frankly that he could not offer the\r\nWar Office to General Boulanger. \"Anything else, my dear general,\r\nyou shall have,\" he said, \"and in a few months probably you may\r\nhave that also; but if you formed part of the Cabinet at first, I\r\ncould not conciliate the Chamber. You shall be military governor\r\nof Paris,--the noblest military post in the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut this offer was incompatible with the secret engagements that\r\nthe general had entered into not an hour before. The conference,\r\ntherefore, broke up at five in the morning without a decision having\r\nbeen reached.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the two gentlemen who had been charged by M. Grévy\r\nto procure him a prime minister, and if possible a cabinet, reported\r\nthe failure of their mission. \"Then all is over for me,\" said M.\r\nGrévy; \"I shall at once send in my resignation.\"\r\n\r\nThe resignation was accepted, and greatly to the surprise of the\r\ngeneral public,--for already the streets were full of excited\r\ncitizens,--M. Sadi-Carnot was elected president, almost without\r\ndiscussion, and without disorder. His election put an end to the\r\nsecret arrangement between Boulanger and the Royalists, and appeared\r\nlikely to give France a more settled government than it had enjoyed\r\nsince the Republic came into existence. The Exposition of 1889,\r\ntoo, was at hand, and Paris was very anxious that no political\r\nconvulsions should frighten away strangers.\r\n\r\nThe general was deeply hurt by his unpopularity in the Chamber,\r\nand by the way in which his former friends had thrown him over; but\r\nhe still had the mob, the army, and the peasantry for his partisans,\r\nnor was he without the sympathy of the Bonapartists.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before he got into trouble with the War Department\r\nfor coming to Paris without leave. It had not been usual for a\r\ngeneral of division to ask leave of the Minister of War for a brief\r\nabsence, nor could General Boulanger forget that he himself had\r\nbeen War Minister not many months before.\r\n\r\nThe general complained bitterly of the way he had been followed\r\nup by the police, as if he had been a criminal. \"From the time I\r\nleft the Ministry of War,\" he said,[1] \"I have been spied upon and\r\nshadowed like a thief. Even my orderly has been bribed to report\r\nfacts and falsehoods concerning me. My letters have been opened,\r\nand copies of my telegrams lie on every minister's table.\" He was\r\ndeprived of his command, and retired from active service.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: To a reporter for \"Figaro.\"]\r\n\r\nThis measure, so far from rendering him innocuous to the Opportunist\r\nparty, brought him into Parliament[2] (as the French Chambers are now\r\ncalled) and increased his popularity. He had been already elected\r\ndeputy both from the Department of the Aisne and the Department of the\r\nDordogne,--the latter without his proposing himself as a candidate,\r\nalthough he was ineligible, and could not take his seat, since at the\r\ntime of his election he was an officer of the Government, holding\r\na command. Having now retired into private life, he stood for the\r\nDepartment of Le Nord, where he was received with enthusiasm and\r\nelected by an immense majority. From all quarters came telegraphic\r\nmessages to him from candidates for parliamentary honors, offering\r\nto resign their seats in favor of the popular hero. Even Corsica\r\nwas anxious to have him for her deputy. But it was not only his\r\nown election which concerned General Boulanger; he wished to secure\r\nthe election of his followers. For that purpose election funds were\r\nneeded, and the alliance with the Royalists was renewed. Whenever\r\na Royalist candidate had a certainty of election, no Boulangist\r\ncandidate was to contend against him. In other cases the agents\r\nof the Comte de Paris were openly to encourage their followers to\r\nvote for the nominee of the ally who was to assist the Monarchists\r\nto oppose the Government. There would have been great difficulty in\r\nraising the money needed for this electoral campaign, had it not\r\nbeen for a lady of high rank, the Duchesse d'Uzès, of unspotted\r\nreputation, and of great enthusiasm for the cause of royalty, who\r\npoured her whole fortune (over three million francs) into the joint\r\ntreasury. The alliance between Boulanger and the Royalists was a\r\nprofound secret. Very few Boulangists suspected that their election\r\nexpenses were being paid by funds drawn from the purses of the\r\nsupporters of monarchy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Parliament before this time meant in French history\r\nthe Provincial Courts, that had chiefly legal functions.]\r\n\r\nFor more than a year the popularity of \"Le brav' Général\" kept the\r\nvarious ministries that succeeded each other in Paris and their\r\nofficials all over France, in perpetual anxiety. Boulanger made journeys\r\nalmost like royal progresses into the Departments. Everywhere crowds\r\ncheered him, reporters followed him, his name was in everybody's\r\nmouth, his doings filled columns of the newspapers in many languages,\r\nand his flower, the carnation, was embroidered on tablecloths and\r\nworn in button-holes. All newspapers and reviews seem to have agreed\r\nthat no man had been so popular in France since the days of the\r\nGreat Emperor. He liked the position thrust upon him, and accepted\r\ngracefully and graciously the adoration he received,--an adoration\r\nborn partly of infectious curiosity, partly from a love of what\r\nis phenomenal, partly from the attraction of the unexpected, and\r\nabove all from the national need of some object of idolatry. France\r\nhad been long destitute of any one to whom she might pay personal\r\ndevotion. Every peasant's cottage throughout France was soon decorated\r\nwith his chromo. He has even been seen on his black horse adorning\r\nthe bamboo hut of a king in Central Africa. Pamphlets, handbills,\r\nand brief biographies were scattered by his friends throughout the\r\nProvinces. His very name, Boulanger--Baker--helped his popularity.\r\nA corn-law passed in France was obnoxious to the country, as tending\r\nto make bread more dear; \"Boulanger is to bring us cheap bread!\r\nLong live our Boulanger!\" became the popular cry.\r\n\r\nBut all this enthusiasm seems to have been founded only on expectation.\r\nGeneral Boulanger had done nothing that might reasonably have attracted\r\nnational gratitude and adoration. Yet there was a strong feeling\r\nthroughout France that Boulanger would save the country from what\r\nwas called the Parliamentary _régime_. France had become weary of\r\nthe squabbles of the seven parties in the Chamber, of the rapid\r\nchanges of ministry, of the perpetual coalitions, lasting just long\r\nenough to overthrow some chief unpopular with two factions strong\r\nenough by combination to get rid of him. The Chamber, it was said,\r\nthough unruly and disorganized, had usurped all the functions of\r\ngovernment, and a republic without an executive officer who can\r\nmaintain himself at its head, has never been known to stand. In\r\nFrance fashion is everything, and in France, in 1888, it was the\r\nfashion to speak ill of parliamentary government.\r\n\r\n\"Why am I a Boulangist?\" cried a young and ardent writer of the\r\nparty.[1] \"Why are my friends Boulangists? Because the general\r\nis the only man in France capable of carrying out the expulsion\r\nof mere talkers from the Chamber of Deputies,--men who deafen the\r\npublic ear, and are good for nothing. Gentlemen, a few hundreds\r\nof you, ever since 1870, have carried on the government. All of\r\nyou are lawyers or literary men, none of you are statesmen.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Le Figaro.]\r\n\r\nAt the height of the popularity of the general his career was very\r\nnear being cut short by a political duel. In France, as we have seen\r\nin the history of the Duchesse de Berri, it is not an unheard-of\r\nthing to get rid of a political adversary by a challenge. After\r\nBoulanger had insulted the Duc d'Aumale while he was Minister of\r\nWar, a challenge passed between himself and an Orleanist, M. le Baron\r\nde Lareinty. Boulanger stood to receive the fire of his adversary,\r\nbut did not fire in return. He was subsequently anxious to fight\r\nJules Ferry; but Jules Ferry declined any meeting of the kind.\r\nAfter he entered the Chamber, his great enemy, Floquet, who was then\r\nin the Cabinet, called him in the course of debate \"A Saint-Arnaud\r\nof the _cafés chantants!_\" Boulanger challenged him for this, and\r\nthe duel took place with swords. Floquet was slightly wounded,\r\nbut the general's foot slipped, and he received his adversary's\r\nsword-point in his throat. It was almost a miracle that it did\r\nnot sever the jugular vein. For some time \"Le brav' Général's\"\r\nlife was despaired of; but when he was pronounced out of danger,\r\nParis amused itself with the thought that the most prominent soldier\r\nin the French army had nearly met his death at the hands of an\r\nelderly lawyer.\r\n\r\nSince the funds furnished to Boulanger for the election expenses\r\nof his candidates, and even for his own personal expenses, came\r\nfrom the Royalist party, he was more bound to it than ever; but he\r\npretended to be guided by a body that called itself the National\r\nRepublican Committee, which he assured his friends, the Monarchists,\r\nhe used only as a screen. When Madame d'Uzès threw her last million\r\ninto the gulf, it seemed expedient to the Royalists to exact more\r\ndefinite pledges from Boulanger than his word as a soldier. \"If\r\nthe present Government of France is overthrown,\" they said, \"and\r\nan appeal made to the people, who will fill the interregnum? Will\r\nGeneral Boulanger, if all power is intrusted to him, consent to give\r\nit up, if the nation votes for monarchy? And with all the machinery\r\nof government in his hands, is it certain that a _plébiscite_ would\r\nbe the free vote of the people?\"\r\n\r\nA general election was to take place in the summer of 1889, at the\r\nheight of the Universal Exposition. Hitherto the various elections\r\nin which Boulanger had contended had been for vacant seats in the\r\nold Assembly. He was anxious to test his popularity in Paris by\r\nstanding for the workman's quarter of Belleville; and in spite\r\nof his being opposed by the Radicals in the Chamber, as well as\r\nby the Government, he was elected by a large majority.\r\n\r\nThe Government then changed its method of attack. It brought in a\r\nbill changing the selection of parliamentary candidates from the\r\n_scrutin de liste_ to the _scrutin d'arrondissement._ Boulanger\r\ntherefore would be eligible for election only in the district in\r\nwhich he was domiciled.\r\n\r\nBesides the National Republican Committee (which the general called\r\nhis screen), there was formed all over France a Boulangist society\r\ncalled the League of Patriots. This league was now attacked by the\r\nGovernment as a conspiracy. A High Court of Justice was formed\r\nby the Senate, before which its leaders were summoned to appear.\r\nBoulanger became seriously alarmed. He did not see how he could act\r\nif shut up in prison. His apprehensions were carefully augmented\r\nby the heads of the police, who had placed one of their agents\r\nabout his person.[1] This man showed him a pretended order for\r\nhis arrest on April 1, 1889. The question of his retirement into\r\nBelgium if his liberty were threatened had been already debated\r\nby himself and his friends. Nearly all of them were against it.\r\n\"Let not the people think our general could run away,\" said some.\r\nBut others answered, \"They will say it is a smart trick; that the\r\ngeneral has cheated the Government.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Les Coulisses du Boulangisme.]\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the false document which was shown him, with great\r\npretence of secrecy, by the police agent, the general hesitated\r\nno longer. On the evening of April 1, accompanied by Madame de\r\nBonnemains, a lady to whom he was paying devoted attention, pending\r\na divorce from his wife, he went to Brussels, followed by his friend\r\nCount Dillon, the go-between in financial matters between the Royalists\r\nand himself. The Cabinet of M. Carnot had learned the value of the\r\nsaying, \"If your enemy wishes to take flight, build him a bridge\r\nof gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe departure of the general threw consternation into the ranks\r\nof his followers. \"It cannot be!\" they cried. Then they consoled\r\nthemselves with the reflection that he must soon return, as he\r\nhad done once before under somewhat similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut he did not return. The Government had triumphed. Boulanger's\r\npower was broken; like a wave, it had toppled over when its crest\r\nwas highest. The High Court of Justice condemned Deroulède the\r\npoet, Rochefort, and Dillon, to confinement for life in a French\r\nfortress. The sentence, however, was simply one of outlawry, for\r\nthey were all with Boulanger.\r\n\r\nThe exiles did not stay long in Brussels. The Government of Belgium\r\nobjected to their remaining so near the frontier of France,--for\r\nin Brussels a telephone connected them with Paris,--and they went\r\nover to London. There, at the general's request, he had an interview\r\nwith the Comte de Paris. But their conversation was limited to\r\nuseless compliments and military affairs. Boulanger's power as a\r\npolitical leader was at an end; the friends of the prince would\r\nadvance him no more funds, and in the elections, which took place\r\nvery quietly in France during the summer, he and his friends suffered\r\ntotal defeat.\r\n\r\nThe Government of France--strengthened not only by the success of\r\nthe Exposition, by its great triumph at the elections, and by the\r\ndiscomfiture of its enemies, but also by the conviction forced upon\r\nparliamentary leaders that the country was weary of mere talk and\r\ndiscord, and demanded harmony and action--now became the strongest\r\nGovernment that France had enjoyed for a long time. The Republic\r\nhad passed the point of danger, the eighteenth year, which had\r\nbeen the limit of every dynasty or form of government in France for\r\nover a century. It rallied to itself men from the ranks of all its\r\nformer enemies, but its greatest victory was over the Monarchists.\r\nThe wreck of their cause by the alliance with a military adventurer\r\nwas a blunder in the eyes of one section of the Royalists; in the\r\neyes of another, it was a dishonor that amounted almost to a crime.\r\n\r\nBoulanger had rallied to himself the clerical party in France by\r\nthe promise of a republic strong enough to protect the weak,--\"a\r\nrepublic that would concern itself with the interests of the people,\r\nand be solicitous to preserve individual liberty in all its forms,\r\nespecially liberty of conscience, that liberty the most to be valued\r\nof all,\"[1] Such a republic it seems possible the Third Republic\r\nmay now become, especially since it is on all hands conceded that\r\nthere is a reaction in France in favor of religious liberty, for\r\nthose who are religious as well as for those who are \"philosophers.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Speech at Tours.]\r\n\r\nPresident Carnot has been an eminently respectable president. He\r\nhas committed no blunders, and if he has awakened little enthusiasm,\r\nhe has called forth no animosities. The worst that can be said of\r\nhim is embodied in caricatures, where he always appears ready to\r\nserve some useful purpose, as a jointed wooden figure that can be\r\nput to many a use.\r\n\r\nThe French army is now stronger and better disciplined, and more\r\nfull of determination to conquer, than any French army has ever\r\nbeen before. But no ruler of France can be anxious to precipitate\r\na war with Germany; and judging from the present state of feeling\r\namong the French, there appear to be no serious political breakers\r\nahead. Of course in France the unexpected is always to be expected,\r\nand what a day may bring forth, nobody knows.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke tells us that in 1887, when a friend of his was\r\ngoing to France, he asked him to ascertain for him if General Boulanger\r\nwere a soldier, a mountebank, or an ass; and the answer brought back\r\nto him was, \"He is a little of them all.\" The general, after his\r\ninterview in London with the Comte de Paris, took up his residence\r\nin the island of Jersey. He cannot but have felt that his popularity\r\nhad failed him, and that his enchanter's wand was broken. From time\r\nto time he made spasmodic efforts to bring himself again to the\r\nnotice of the public. He offered repeatedly to return to France\r\nand stand his trial for conspiracy, provided that the trial might\r\nbe conducted before a regular court of justice, and not before\r\nan especial committee appointed by the Chambers.\r\n\r\nMeantime his domestic relations must have caused him poignant anxiety.\r\nHis wife was his cousin,--a lady of the _haute bourgeoisie_ in a\r\nprovincial town. She appears to have felt herself unequal to what\r\nmight be required of her as the wife of the national hero. She\r\nentertained apprehensions that her fate might be that of the Empress\r\nJosephine. When her husband became War Minister, she declined to\r\npreside over his receptions, and withdrew herself from his official\r\nresidence, taking with her her two daughters, Hélène and Marcelle.\r\nThus deserted, Boulanger became open to scandals and reports, some\r\ntrue, and some false, such as would inevitably be circulated in\r\nFrance concerning such a man's relations with women. It is quite\r\ncertain, however, that at the height of his popularity he became\r\ninfatuated with the divorced wife of a Baron de Bonnemains,--a\r\nlady well connected, and up to the time when Boulanger became her\r\nlover, of unstained reputation. She was also rich, having a fortune\r\nof 1,500,000 francs. She was not very beautiful, but was tender,\r\ngracious, and womanly. M. de Bonnemains had not made her a good\r\nhusband, and her friends rejoiced when the law gave her a divorce.\r\nGeneral Boulanger and his wife seem to have agreed to sever their\r\nmarriage tie under the new French divorce law, which requires both\r\nparties to be examined by a judge, who is to try if possible to\r\nreconcile them; but at the last moment Madame Boulanger refused,\r\nupon religious grounds, her assent to a divorce, and the marriage\r\nof the general with Madame de Bonnemains became thenceforward\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe story is not a pleasant one, but it is necessary to relate it,\r\nbecause of its results.\r\n\r\nMadame de Bonnemains, whose constitution was consumptive, drooped\r\nand sickened in Jersey. She removed in the spring of 1891 to Brussels\r\nto try one of the new schemes for the cure of pulmonary trouble.\r\nThe remedy seems to have hastened her death, which took place in\r\nJuly. General Boulanger never recovered from her loss. His friends\r\nand his funds had failed him, and the death of this woman, whom\r\nhe had passionately loved, completely overwhelmed him. He spoke\r\nconstantly of suicide, and in spite of precautions taken by his\r\nfriends, he carried his purpose into effect upon her grave in the\r\ncemetery of Brussels, October 2, 1891.\r\n\r\nWhatever General Boulanger's faults may have been in relation to\r\nother women, he was devoted to his mother. The latter, who was\r\neighty-six years old at the time of his death, resided in Paris,\r\nand when he was in the city he never suffered a day to pass without\r\nvisiting her. A lock of her white hair was on his breast when he\r\nwas dressed for burial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\nAbdul Aziz, Sultan, 232.\r\nAbdul Kader, 82, 94.\r\nAbdul Medjid, 86.\r\nAbout, Edmond, quoted, 248.\r\nAdélaïde, Madame, of Orleans, 20, 25, 26, 55, 83, 108.\r\nAffre, Denis Auguste, Archbishop of Paris, 142 _et seq._\r\nAfrican generals, 94;
